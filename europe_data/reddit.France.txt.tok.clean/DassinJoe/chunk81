  if you need a police escort for basic ambulance transportation because otherwise your car gets pelted with stones , things are fucked up . 
  i agree , but i do n't know that it 's a specific immigrant issue . 
  i grew up in a part of dublin where some teenagers would set fires for the sole purpose of stoning the fire brigade when they arrived to put it out . 
  these were n't immigrant kids ( there was almost zero immigration to ireland at the time ) , but they felt the need to attack the representatives of the state for whatever reason . 
   i guess all the member states have to agree i guess art 50 has to be triggered too ;-), 
  it 's an amazing waterfall .

  lol . 
  you 're wrong . 
  grow up and get over it . 
  merriam webster : fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign oxford : dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries . 
  dictionary.com : fear or hatred of foreigners , people from different cultures , or strangers 2 . fear or dislike of the customs , dress , etc. , of people who are culturally different from oneself ------ there 's no implication of irrationality . 
  a blanket ban on people from a particular country is simply xenophobic .

  did n't some guy in the netherlands get the government to pay for his sex worker a few years back ? 
   you did n't had a terrorist attack for a while thanks to that . 
  difficult to prove . 
   it 's not xenophobic it is exactly xenophobic . 
  this is great !, 
  no , france is n't under `` martial law '' , which describes a situation where the military has taken over government . 
  france is in a `` state of emergency '' , which gives the ( civilian ) government and security services additional powers . 
  i agree it has lasted too long . 
  slightly less sensationalist story in [ le parisien ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.leparisien.fr%2fparis-75018%2fbarbes-sous-tension-pour-le-rassemblement-de-soutien-a-theo-15-02-2017-6684516.php&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) ( google translate link ), 
  they 're rioting for entertainment . 
  drivers in france can be very aggressive , but i find the standard of driving is generally quite good . 
  i 've found belgium and the netherlands to be much worse . 
  but then again , what do i know - i 'm drunk all the time . 
  you 've got to be codding me !, 
  what was he doing in that plaice ? 
  wow , bona fide nazi whataboutery in the wild !, 
  saving this one . 
  and the admiration for mussolini ? 
  cold weather and long nights . 
  the fn is n't overtly anti-jewish these days , but le pen p\u00e8re and a lot of the old guard are still around . 
  that 's exactly what this is about . 
  it 's also been deemphasized so that most people do n't notice it , but if anyone cares enough it 's there . 
   i am not really sure how you reached that conclusion . 
  by reading page 44 :  we decided to take a 20 year forecasting period , so as to include at least a couple of economic cycles . 
  we commissioned a leading , independent economic forecaster volterra , with the work led by economists professor paul ormerod and bridget rosewell . 
  ...  you seem to have correctly copied and pasted one sentence yes , because it 's specific . 
  in contrast , the next sentence is dreadful :  however , these forecasts also indicate there is uncertainty associated both in leaving the eu and staying in it . 
  and the subsequent one even worse :  perhaps this should not be a surprise . 
  and then we have :  the eu has changed much since its origins , so its future path is also likely to be uncertain . 
  you 've lost me completely . 
   no , his initial analysis was based on assumptions . 
  all of the analyses are based on assumptions . 
  that 's how you construct models of the future . 
  having read the 2016 report , it turns out that the work was done by paul ormerod and bridget rosewell , and lyons just put his name on the main document . 
  the conclusion concerning the forecasts is :  clearly these forecasts show a higher downside risk outside the eu , highlighting the importance of the policy chosen . 
   the values that he thinks are most likely . 
  he has designed four models to represent four situations . 
  he 's already assigned the values he thinks are most likely . 
  his results are based on optimistic/pessimistic brexit and optimistic/pessimistic remain . 
  he may have an ideological reason to support brexit , as you do , but his models suggest that a risk averse actor should support remain . 
  perhaps he is not risk averse . 
   in his view given 615 is grater than 490 , brexit made sense . 
  not really . 
  if we expect consistency in a rational actor , he should compare optimistic numbers or pessimistic numbers , not take optimistic brexit versus pessimistic remain . 
  in ten years time i should be able to say something like `` siri , from the point of view of its services trade , do you think the uk would have been better off staying in the eu ? '', 
  she can fill in the gaps . 
   why do we think of manufacturing as being somehow more important than other economic activity ? 
  i do n't and i never suggested it is . 
  my personal preference is for a mixed economic model . 
  people who work in manufacturing think it 's important . 
   many thanks for linking to a page written in march of 2016 are you becoming tetchy ? 
   you will see that lyons ... has already been proved false , he 's co-chair of economists for brexit , so i 'm interested in his analysis and his predictive abilities . 
   also , it does not really make sense to average scenarios expectations in this way because those scenarios are not equally likely . 
  this is just fake maths . 
  you can certainly take the absolute values if you prefer . 
  remain either # 640 billion or # 490 billion . 
  brexit either # 615 billion or # 430 billion . 
   fn would `` allow everyone to find their place '' in french society . 
  yeah , we know how that would work ... * lgbt people . 
  your place is there , as second-class citizens . 
  * * and foreign people , your place is sort of ... elsewhere ... not in france but y' know , back where you came from ... * * and now the jews ... *, 
   creating a civil union ( enhanced pacs ) that will replace the provisions of the taubira law , without retroactive effect . 
  leading to different status of married gay couples ( 2013-17 ) and super-pacsed gay couples ( 2017 -  ? ), 
  seems completely pointless . 
   economists for brexit :-) i 'm always interested in economists who promote brexit . 
  here 's a couple of links on the co-chairpeople : patrick minford : [ brexit would ` mostly eliminate manufacturing ' ] ( http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mps-react-after-vote-leave-11269819 ) gerard lyons : [ on lyons 's numbers , the average remain scenario is 24 percent better than the average of the two brexit options . 
  ] ( https://infacts.org/brexit-camps-own-goal/ ), 
  it 's a troll account . 
  it does n't have a clue . 
   i think you need to formulate your questions either in terms of percentage or in terms of volume . 
   i expect i 'll just ask siri to run an optimistic , a pessimistic , and an in-between model , then give me her measured opinion . 
   but we can not predict with certainty whether or not the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ uk will be protectionist . 
  again , we 're looking 10 years down the line . 
  it might be corbyn 's second mandate ... 
  hmm , i 'm not sure the remindme bot is working . 
   i do n't see either of these things as pushing towards the eu they do n't need to `` push '' . 
  they can be pulled or , more likely , services will emerge to offer an eu alternative to what was previously offered by london . 
  you seem to think the market for services is intrinsically different from the market for goods , but i do n't think it is . 
  10 years `` has intra-eu services trade increased since brexit ? 
  has eu-uk services trade declined ? 
  what is the trend for eu-uk services trade ? '', 
   why would you assume that ? 
  expertise , experience , jurisdictional issues . 
   overtime , we will become more globalised rather than less globalised . 
  that 's entirely consistent with what i said . 
  in the future , services currently purchased by the eu from the uk will more likely be purchased by the eu from elsewhere in the eu .
