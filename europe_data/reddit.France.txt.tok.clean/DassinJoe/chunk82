  meanwhile the uk may see a yuge increase in services trade with the us , for example . 
  i 'm commenting on trade trends between eu/uk , not global trade trends . 
  / r/europemeta, 
  true , but i 'm confident they 'll manage to find a common ground . 
  it 's in everyone 's short to medium term interests to continue to have mutually beneficial trade relations with the uk , at least for goods . 
  for complex products - car manufacturing within europe , for example - the clear conclusion is that in the short term we should try to avoid disruption as much as possible because supply chains have become exceptionally transnational . 
  over time some eu firms will seek to supplant british imports within the eu , and vice versa , but that 's to be expected and is normal enough . 
  imo , the real danger in the goods market is that british production standards will be relaxed . 
  this will add costs for everyone as compliance that has been more or less taken on trust in the past will have to be actively verified . 
  for services , it 's more complicated , but in the short term there 's some interest in maintaining the status quo with certain modifications ( things we 're seeing already , like increased operations in frankfurt/paris/dublin ) . 
  again , longer term there 'll be a drift to the eu and away from britain , but that 's to be expected . 
   and what are ( the people of ) other member states going to say ? 
  i will say * i 'm pleased for the uk , but i 'm very happy to live in an eu member state with all of the benefits that brings . 
   surly they 're gon na gamble and give us a good deal and hope it goes tits up they 're not adolescents . 
  the eu negotiators will seek a deal that 's in the best interests of the remaining member states . 
  whether this is a `` good '' or `` bad '' deal for the uk is of secondary concern . 
  the eu negotiators certainly wo n't ` gamble ' with a good deal in the hope that at some future unspecified date the uk will falter and the eu will save face . 
  tony blair , allegedly . 
  there are two interesting little nuggets at the end of this page from [ ashcroft 's polling agency ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ ) : 1 . 
  seven voters in ten expected a victory for remain , including a majority ( 54 % ) of those who voted to leave . 
  more than three quarters ( 77 % ) of those who voted to remain thought `` the decision we make in the referendum could have disastrous consequences for us as a country if we get it wrong '' . 
  more than two thirds ( 69 % ) of leavers , by contrast , thought the decision `` might make us a bit better or worse off as a country , but there probably is n't much in it either way '' . 
   une mission de dissuasion nucl\u00e9aire a mission of nuclear dissuasion . 
  all hail discordia . 
   you are saying that ~ ~ russia government policies is making the life of the average russian more shit ~ ~ `` france has sanctions because of russian government actions '' ftfy . 
   under the current russian government , the life has actually become better . 
  is n't that lovely for you . 
  it 's definitely related to that . 
  there are certain privileges bestowed upon some members of the british aristocracy purely by right of birth . 
  my impression is that the royal families of spain , the netherlands , and norway are treated very similarly to private citizens , and that aristos in these countries do not enjoy privileges above and beyond private citizens . 
  nope , and i never said i did . 
  poykhavshiy said `` france has sanctions to make life shit for russians '' . 
  i said `` france has sanctions because of russian government actions '' . 
  what is so hard to understand about that ? 
  i do n't know their political foundations as well as i know those of the uk . 
  in any case it 's a side issue : i was explaining the differences i perceive in the `` anglo saxon '' model , ie between the uk and the us . 
  the life of the average russian is becoming more shit because of the russian government 's policies . 
  take some responsibility for your own fucking mess . 
  but there 's a very clear understanding in britain that some people are better than others . 
  equality is not enshrined in the same way as in the ( notional ) republics . 
  what 's the uk equivalent of `` we hold these truths to be self-evident/that all men are created equal '' or `` libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 '' ? 
   not to mention fishing grounds . 
  lol . 
  i 've always found italians very welcoming of children , and most italian restaurants ( both in and outside italy ) i 've visited have been great for kids . 
  do police have any leads ? 
    things have been going downhill very rapidly . 
   what ` things ' ? 
  [ start here and work your way down . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_liberties_in_the_united_kingdom#1980s ) a few highlights ( [ from here ] ( http://www.scriptonitedaily.com/2013/03/19/police-state-uk-the-rights-you-didnt-know-youd-lost/ ) ) : ** detention ** prior to 1984 , a person could not be held by police for longer than 24 hours without a criminal charge being made against them . 
  the thatcher government extended this to 4 days . 
  new labour extended to 7 days , then to 14 days , and finally sought the power to detain citizens without charge for up to 90 days , at the request of the police . 
  the blair government was defeated on 90 days , the period was doubled nevertheless to 28 day . 
  the tory/libdem coalition allowed this legislation to expire in 2011 , returning the period to 14 days , only to apply for permission to extend to 28 days in the same year . 
  the anti terrorism and security act 2001 allowed for indefinite detention of non british citizens suspected of committing terrorist acts , where there was not enough evidence to proceed to a court of law . 
  ** surveillance ** until 1986 there were severe restrictions on the police and state ability to surveil its citizens ; phone tapping and the interception of private communications were inadmissible in courts and heavily penalised . 
  however , since 1986 , an altogether different approach has been adopted . 
  the thatcher governments interception of communications act 1985 gave permission for phone tapping . 
  these permissions and other communication interception measures were approved in 1994 and 1997 . 
  however , the era of new labour saw a massive roll out in surveillance under the guise of the war on terror . 
  the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 allowed the government full surveillance powers over all kinds of communications . 
  the acts main provisions allow five new categories of surveillance from bugging of phones to spying and intercepting of communications . 
  it allows the home secretary to issue an interception warrant to examine the contents of letters or communications on various grounds including in the interests of the economic well-being of the united kingdom . 
  it also prevents the existence of interception warrants , and any and all data collected with them from being revealed in court . 
  it allows the police , intelligence services , hm revenue and customs ( and several hundred more public bodies , including local authorities and a wide range of regulators ) to demand telephone , internet and postal service providers to hand over detailed communications records for individual users . 
  this can include name and address , phone calls made and received , source and destination of emails , internet browsing information and mobile phone positioning data that records user 's location . 
  these powers are self-authorised by the body concerned , with no external or judicial oversight . 
  these powers have been extensively overused by police , councils and other enforcement agencies . 
  it has rightly been deemed as a ` snooper 's charter ' . 
  the current rate is 30 warrants being issued a week . 
  in the 15 months from july 2005 to october 2006 , 2407 warrants were issued . 
  there has also been a rise in cctv operations , or the filming of people in public spaces . 
  britain has gone from zero to over 4 million cctv cameras in recent decades . 
  the country has a higher number of cameras than china despite being a small fraction of the size . 
   `` in the anglo-saxon model , there 's a preference for liberty , '' says oubrou . 
  `` so the system does n't promise equality and equal salaries . 
  france promises equality , but falls short . 
  and this is what creates the frustration that can lead to violence . '', 
  i like this guy , but i 'm not sure i agree with this . 
  both the us and the french models promise equality of opportunity and equality before the law . 
  both fall short of this , of course , but the aspiration is there . 
  the difference in france is that equality is emphasized more , so the failure to deliver is experienced more deeply . 
  the uk is a different case - there 's very little public mention of equality because the society is still very hierarchical . 
  usa has the best cherries . 
  have cake , eat cake , and trade cake with both eu countries and commonwealth countries . 
  yeah i agree that your last link is deeply worrying . 
  the potential is enormous with relatively few people required . 
  bio and chem attacks suffer from the difficulty of dispersion . 
  there are some ways around this i think but they require a very long prep time . 
  as lolanovaro says , malls and museums and concerts . 
  travelling internationally , except by car , is generally subject to back checks . 
  i 'm not convinced . 
  yeah but generalising again that 's how dads show they care versus how mums show they care . 
  talking to my sister yesterday about an issue with my niece - she says about our dad `` all he wants to do is fix the problem , but he ca n't '' . 
  but really that 's just him being him , or more vaguely him being a dad . 
  tbh most people i know who have been pickpocketed should have known better . 
  guys carrying wallets in back pockets ffs . 
  i do n't find paris worse than most big european cities - a lot less hassle than amsterdam for example - and i still feel safer in paris than in most big us cities , with the possible exceptions of boston and sf . 
   if the brussels bombers had access to real quantities of real explosive state actor level quantities of state actor level explosives . 
  conceivable but not going to be cooked up in a kitchen in molenbeek . 
  not sure you understand how the big money theft works in paris .
