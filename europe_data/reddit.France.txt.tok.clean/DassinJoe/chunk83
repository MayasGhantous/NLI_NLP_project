  i started doing the 1st aid kit thing when i became a dad . 
  always have a basic set of supplies with me - weighs very little and has come in handy many times . 
  i find security has lessened versus a year ago . 
  fewer bag searches now for example . 
  funny , i drove past it a few times on thursday and was struck by how pretty it looked . 
  should have all the up votes . 
  fair enough :-), 
  people injured by smoke inhalation from a fire that broke out `` in a part of the complex away from the nuclear section '' . 
   the curvatures the wrong way . 
  you can attribute that to ~ ~ poetic ~ ~ structural license . 
  it 's not meant to be photo-realistic tbh . 
  the cables above the arch are evocative of a harp box , but they 're on the wrong side . 
  yeah but if you 've already made something that 's vaguely harp-like , it certainly makes sense to enhance it to look more like a harp , given that it 's going to be in the capital city of harp country ? 
  that 'd be cool in fairness , though might look better facing onto the bay . 
  seriously ? 
  look at the differences in the two bridges . 
  why so many cables on a smaller version ? 
  why that particular curvature ? 
  why use that style of attachment for the cables ? 
  how about this : one bridge can be made according to the same principles as another , but also have its design inspired by a particular object . 
   is it fuck , it 's just a smaller version of ... fuckity fuck-fuck fuck . 
  [ the bridge , which rotates through 90 degrees , is asymmetric reflecting a harp laid on its side , with the base to the cable stayed steel pylon set outside of the river 's navigational channel -- 28m from the river 's south quay wall . 
  the pylon curves northwards to a point 48m above the water level with 25 cables set in a harp formation . 
  the deck consists of two pedestrian and cycle tracks , two traffic lanes and two lanes dedicated to buses . 
  this configuration can be adapted to accommodate trams in the future .

  it 's designed to look like a celtic harp on its side . 
  is it any wonder the internet is full of adverts for russian women seeking western men ? 
  that 's really beautiful !, 
  one difference with north america is due to a softer onset of autumn : [ temperature , sunlight , and soil moisture greatly influence the quality of the fall foliage display . 
  abundant sunlight and low temperatures after the time the abscission layer forms cause the chlorophyll to be destroyed more rapidly . 
  cool temperatures , particularly at night , combined with abundant sunlight , promote the formation of more anthocyanins . 
  ] ( http://www.usna.usda.gov/photogallery/fallfoliage/sciencefallcolor.html ) another is the distribution of tree species . 
  i live in a forest but the primary trees are oak , pine and beech . 
  we get plenty of yellows but very few reds in autumn . 
  the colours tend to be muted as well . 
  i have some virginia creeper in my garden - it covered the back of the house when we arrived here , but i cut it back every year because it 's not great for the facade . 
  another chance to share dan & dan 's [ daily mail song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ebt6osr1ti ) !, 
  i know the daily mail has always been somewhat middlebrow , but in recent years the website seems to have gone fully lowbrow . 
  the side bar stories today : kardashian 's bottom , pictures of woman breastfeeding , another kardashian 's bra , some woman 's underboob , more kardashian , some woman on the beach . 
  it 's like a sleazy version of hello !, 
  magazine . 
  it 's both a bridge and a tunnel , because they had to reinforce the canal in order to go below it . 
  here 's a description of the project : https://structurae.net/structures/carentan-canal-bridge, 
  the sun in the uk ran with this headline a few days ago :  spanish supermarkets secretly hoarding massive stockpiles of vegetables despite british shoppers facing rationing, 
  the leave campaign and more recently the government have claimed * of course the eu needs the uk - who else is going to buy all the german cars and italian prosecco ? * . 
  it 's little wonder that this has led more britons to believe that the eu needs the uk rather than vice versa .

  it has serious consequences : anemia , bacterial infections , occlusive vascular accidents . 
  there are 12,000 patients in france , and there are about 400 cases among infants each year . 
  ...  `` in practice , '' explains val\u00e9rie gauthereau , director of the parisian federation of screening , we try in the maternity hospitals to target people of maghrebian or african origin . '', 
   a targeting that is based on fairly informal criteria : parents ' appearance , family name ... but that can misfire . 
  this is why , in ile-de-france , for example , `` certain maternity units target 100 % of the population , to be sure not to miss a case , '' says ms. gauthereau .

  another amazing french/british collaboration - structural engineer michel virlogeux ( also worked on the pont de normandie at le havre ) and architect norman foster ( london city hall , the gherkin , wembley stadium ) . 
  i think it 's the tallest bridge in the world , not just in europe ? 
  screw second !, 
  first or nothing !, 
  interesting . 
  i 'd be fairly sure a good portion of those supporting a ban in most countries also consider themselves open minded and tolerant of other religions . 
  it 'd be interesting to see some more nuanced statements , like `` dispersed families of immigrants should ( not ) have some chance of being reunited '' . 
  a blanket statement like the one used may provoke thoughts of the migrant crisis rather than a broader perspective . 
  goes very well with a * gratin dauphinois * . 
  friend of mine is from north antrim , where the pro-brexit dup has the most support . 
  the local economy is dominated by dairy farming , with about one third of milk shipped south for processing . 
  these farms face a very uncertain future , but the dup seems ready to sacrifice them on the altar of brexit . 
  does n't really matter how your school is ranked if your area of research is deemed unwelcome by the new regime . 
  lmao . 
  last time i 'll say it : his voice was raised but not shouting ( i think you even said screaming once !, 
  ) , her security team were still with her , he was over a metre away from her . 
  he 's not mobbing her , end of story . 
  i do n't have the foggiest why you keep bringing a princess diana into it . 
  it 's a dreadful analogy but i suppose you 're clutching at straws . 
  punching reporters is not cool . 
  woah there cowboy !, 
  there 's `` the facts '' . 
  there 's no `` my facts '' or `` your facts '' . 
  if you think you have your own facts you 're further gone than i suspected . 
  no i do n't agree with you . 
  you 're clearly seeking to defend mlp . 
  he 's not shouting . 
  the mic is not in her face . 
  her security cordon is still around her , whereas the venue security people are behind the reporter . 
  you 're clutching at straws to defend mlp . 
  enjoy `` your facts '' . 
  do n't think you understood the article . 
  nice try to obfuscate , but you should read an account of the incident . 
  it 's not mlp 's security who grab him , it 's the security for the venue who 've been asked to do so by mlp 's people . 
  edit : i note you mistakenly assert that i agree with :  ** my facts ** this is very telling . 
  you 're one of the `` alternative fact '' brigade i see . 
   kinda click bait headline it 's the telegraph - it thrives on such stories . 
  video from the daily express ? 
  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy . 
  it 's a commentary on the asymmetric nature of the encounter . 
  first , he attacked four solders . 
  second , he was wielding a knife ( perhaps machete ) whereas they probably had assault rifles . 
   a patrol of four soldiers are reported to have tried to subdue the assailant using non-lethal force after he rushed at them . 
   when this failed and after one soldier was injured , five shots were fired . 
  the suspected attacker was taken to hospital .
