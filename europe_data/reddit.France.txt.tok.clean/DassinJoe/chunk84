  no i do n't really think he was attempting suicide , but i do think he 's probably deranged . 
  lmao . 
  let 's step back a little . 
  you said :  so reporter pushes past security where 's the evidence of this ? 
   get in politician 's face no , clearly from the video he 's over a metre away and there 's a photographer who is closer . 
  you 're wrong . 
   to scream questions clearly not screaming . 
  you 're wrong . 
   security pushes him back . 
  again , you 're just simply wrong . 
  he 's clearly ** grabbed from behind ** . 
  have you watched the video ? 
  they installed an x-ray machine a couple of years ago at the entrance to the museum proper . 
  sounds like this guy was in the carrousel de louvre , which is the underground shopping area that leads to the museum . 
  attempted suicide by ~ ~ cop ~ ~ soldier . 
  watched it twice . 
  screaming has a strict definition . 
  the journalist 's voice is raised , but he is not screaming . 
   denmark is the guy sitting on the right at the start an actor ? 
  i think i 've seen him in something . 
   this happens in plenty of other countries not on diplomatic passports . 
  this is the troll administration . 
  if the troll-in-chief appoints malloch , the eu should simply refuse to receive him . 
  fascists are gon na fasch . 
   so reporter pushes past security to get in politician 's face to scream questions , security pushes him back . 
  no that 's balls . 
  he gets within two metres of her , but we do n't see him pushing `` past security '' and there 's a photographer who 's even closer to her . 
  he 's clearly not screaming but asking a question in a normal manner for a tv journalist . 
  he 's then grabbed from behind and dragged away . 
  oh no you have n't !, 
  heavy on aspiration and light on detail . 
  yes , that 's it .

  oh no you have n't !, 
  what a fantastic city !, 
  i 've never been up to the top of montparnasse . 
  is it worth a visit ? 
  the time and expertise taken to reach an agreement . 
  britain is already short of negotiators . 
  even if they just wanted deals with 11 of the original eu 12 , they 'd be spread very thinly and progress would be very slow . 
  just to clarify the recent wallonia issue with the canada deal : it delayed the process for perhaps a week . 
  this guy has an interesting [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_navarro ) . 
   navarro 's views on trade and china have been widely characterized by economists as fringe . 
  university of michigan economist justin wolfers described them as far `` outside the mainstream , '' noting that `` he endorses few of the key tenets of '' the economics profession . 
  scott sumner , the ralph g. hawtrey chair of monetary policy at the mercatus center at george mason university , said that navarro 's views on trade economics and macroeconomics , two sub-fields that navarro has published ** no peer-reviewed research ** in , demonstrate ** basic errors and confused thinking ** . 
   navarro has , for instance , repeatedly characterized value-added taxes as a tariff , whereas sumner notes that `` this is a very basic error . 
  international economists almost universally agree that a vat is neutral with respect to trade . '', 
  a new yorker reporter described navarro 's views on trade and china as so radical `` that , even with his assistance , i was unable to find another economist who fully agrees with them . '', 
  tim worstall , senior fellow at the adam smith institute , has described navarro as ** `` alarmingly ignorant about trade '' ** . 
  according to worstall , the reason why there are no economists who support navarro 's views is because he makes ** very basic errors about trade economics ** . 
   according to richard baldwin , professor of international economics at the graduate institute , geneva , navarro 's economic plan for trump reflects ** `` astoundingly ignorant economics '' ** . 
  dan ikenson , director of cato 's herbert a. stiefel center for trade policy studies , described navarro 's views on trade as ** `` misguided '' and `` dangerous '' ** . 
  the economist magazine has described navarro 's views on trade as `` dodgy economics '' and `` fantasy '' . 
  instead of ** i 'm feeling lucky ** button , there should be a ** bof ** button . 
  60 billion is not that much given the amount of trade between britain and the eu . 
  maybe four months worth of exports from britain to eu ? 
  what if he promises not to grab the queen 's corgi ? 
  trump has been invited remarkably early into his presidency . 
  uk elections to the european parliament are under a multiseat pr system ( d'hondt system ) and are arguably more ` representative ' of people 's preferences than the elections to the uk parliament . 
  i doubt very much she 'll pay it , so they 'll have to garnish her salary . 
  `` those are my principles , and if you do n't like them ... well , i have others . '',

  `` developers !, 
  developers !, 
  developers !, 
  developers ! '', 
  i 've seen cost estimates ( by uk import/export people ) of +5 % to +10 % simply from the uk no longer being in the single market . 
  no tariffs , just increased paperwork . 
  in the interests of balance , i 've also had a uk poster stating that he 's exported and imported loads of stuff outside the single market and it only took a few hours ' work . 
    the freedom to honor one 's culture , faith , and individuality freely  this is more an american ideal than a european one . 
  ...  i 'm not going to try and define dozens of countries cultures or customs in a couple of lines on reddit thanks . 
  but you 're happy enough to define american ideals even though , presumably , you 're not american ? 
   may should march out of here july noted . 
  an interesting article . 
  there 's a statue of [ larkin on o'connell street ] ( http://archiseek.com/2010/1980-jim-larkin-statue-oconnell-street-dublin/ ) in dublin , facing what used to be clerys department store . 
  clerys had been owned by william martin murphy , so the positioning of the statue quite sublime . 
   there were at least five hundred casualties in dublin . 
  this day has been commemorated as bloody sunday in modern irish history . 
  unfortunately we have two more bloody sundays that followed .

   it 's lazy to try and define a country 's values with reference to something like undr . . 
  but it 's nevertheless a whole lot more than you 've done . 
  and we usually use `` both '' when referring to two things , not three . 
  but if a given country signs up to the undhr or the echr , ca n't we make certain statements about the values that country aspires to ? 
  or are you saying that we should n't expect citizens of a country to adhere to the sort of values espoused in that country 's international treaties ? 
  you disagree with one formulation of european values . 
  you assert that some cultures are incompatible with european values . 
  you further assert that this is the source of disharmony . 
  but you do n't provide your own exposition of these values ? 
   mrs may knows that her difficult negotiations with the eu will become all-but-impossible if member states believe that the uk is actively working to destroy their organisation in alliance with mr trump . 
  i think member states are cautious about taking trump too seriously . 
  he and his acolytes spout plenty of nonsense , but eu politicians will be more concerned about actions than words . 
   her official position is that britain wants to work with a strong eu . 
  she probably even means it , given the economic and political dangers that would flow from its break-up . 
  britain 's trade will benefit from the continued existence of the eu . 
  a single trade agreement is a lot more appealing than 27 separate agreements . 
   trump is more of a caligula than a nero though .
