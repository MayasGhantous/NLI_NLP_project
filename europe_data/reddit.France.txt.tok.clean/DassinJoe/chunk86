  missed a chance for a portmanteau there : brexodus !, 
    do you want to abolish verbotsg or not ? 
   i want to have robust freedom of expression . 
  here and everywhere if that is what you are asking . 
  that was very simple question and you avoided it . 
  do you want to abolish verbotsg ? 
  i do n't see the benefit to austrian society in allowing neo-nazis publish such songs , but if you do then by all means run for election on that platform . 
  but do n't try to tell me that i 'm advocating a ` thought police ' when i 'm simply advocating for a ` crime police ' . 
   and he would lose that debate , believe me . 
  i believe in different , more effective methods of ideological persuasion than banning speech . 
  good luck debating with nazis . 
   who gave you the impression that i am not concerned about them or their rights ? 
  you did . 
  do you want to abolish verbotsg or not ? 
   the emotional confltion you are attempting here well excuse me if discussion about nazis raises emotions . 
   of course i do not agree with mocking them but that does not mean it is correct to encrach on important other freedoms because of it . 
  what do you think a song called * in buchenwald * that 's been written and produced by a neo-nazi is about ? 
  do you think it 's an historically accurate account of what went on in the camp ? 
  you do n't agree with belittling nazi history , but you do n't agree with making it illegal to do so either . 
  you 'd rather allow this guy to sell his records , promote his hatred , maybe organise more people with similar views , than take a stand against him and say * `` this historical event is so repugnant that your freedom of expression can be curtailed if you seek to misrepresent it '' * . 
  i just reversed my downvote because it 's so rare to see someone admitting that . 
  fair play to you . 
   i would still have my constitutionally appointed rights and liberties and his acts would be unconstitutional if he tried . 
  so your rights are grounded in the constitution . 
  what about people who had relatives killed at buchenwald ? 
  do they have the `` right '' to have the systematic state-sponsored murder of their relatives treated as the atrocity that it was ? 
  do they have the `` right '' not to see some fuckwit selling songs about the camp ? 
  [ well , yes in austria they currently do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verbotsgesetz_1947 ) . 
   the verbotsgesetz 1947 ( prohibition act 1947 ) , abbreviated verbotsg , is an austrian constitutional law passed on 8 may 1945 , [ 1 ] which banned the nazi party and provided the legal grounds for the process of denazification in austria , as well as aiming to suppress any potential revival of nazism . 
   the present version became applicable on 18 february 1947 . 
  the law , which was updated in 1992 , prohibits holocaust denial as well as the ** deliberate belittlement of any nazi atrocities . 
  ** but you 're only concerned with your constitutionally appointed rights , not with the relatives of the victims of nazis ? 
  that 's mostly irrelevant as we 're not in the same jurisdiction , but let 's explore your support for absolute freedom of speech . 
  if this guy got out of jail and ran for office on a platform of doing away with elections , would you have a problem with that ? 
  what if he ran for a office on a platform of doing away with elections and sending austrian reddit users to forced labour camps ? 
  sending austrian reddit users to extermination camps ? 
  where does his freedom of expression begin to impinge upon your rights ? 
   it is the central mechanism of problem solving and self control in a democracy should freedom of expression be reciprocal ? 
  do you extend unlimited freedom of expression to people who would deny it to you and to others ? 
  writing , recording , and selling a song called * in buchenwald * , for example . 
   thought crime describes the act of punishing people for voicing their beliefs . 
  no it does n't . 
  a thought crime is holding a belief or doubt that is opposed to the dominant party/viewpoint . 
  the 1984 example is not about * freedom of expression * but * freedom of thought * . 
  if you 're going to accuse me of saying the exact same thing , at least clarify what this thing is . 
  this case is about * freedom of expression * , and this is not an absolute freedom . 
  it is very well protected in the us , for example , but in most of europe there are specific limits on freedom of expression . 
   because the exact same thing would have been said in 1984 . 
  no it would n't . 
  he 's not being imprisoned for a ** thought crime ** . 
  he 's being imprisoned for an ** action crime ** . 
  why so ? 
   did this individual infringe ( or incite another to infringe ) the rights of others ? 
  support for a genocidal ideology is incitement to infringe the rights of others . 
  [ guy de maupassant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eiffel_tower#artists.27_protest ) would have been happy living there . 
  how do we distinguish a crime of thought from a crime of action ? 
  quite simply by examining the physical world . 
  if you want to dwell in some poorly remembered orwellian mental dystopia , go ahead . 
  i 'll live in the real world where there are laws and courts and prisons . 
   * blah blah blah * ... under the mighty boot of president schulz of the greater european co-prosperity sphere are you really so insecure that you have to turn a story about internal uk politics into some sort of imagined attack by the eu ? 
  what ? 
  this is your own libdem leader . 
  it 's nothing to do with the eu . 
   imprisoned for ~ ~ wrongthink ~ ~ breaking the law by the ~ ~ thinkpol ~ ~ justice system of the country where he resides , this is ~ ~ doubleplusgood ~ ~ how a normal society works . 
  ftfy, 
  oh the burn ... good thing s/he eats coolant . 
  good stuff . 
  it will be interesting to see how brexit affects data hosting and suchlike . 
  a nice big tube between ireland and france will be welcome . 
  it 's not that the number of births was really low ( it has been lower many years in the past ) , but that natural population growth ( births minus deaths ) was at its lowest since 40 years . 
  it was hollande rather than sarko who introduced cuts to financial support for children/parents . 
  and the uk govt is currently playing a blinder in supporting ni , the gfa , and the peace process . 
   when in history has china 's huge population made them superior to the uk what does `` superior '' mean in this context ? 
  i was responding to :  china would n't be able to compete in international economic terms `` compete '' would suggest exports . 
  i 've posted merchandise export stats elsewhere on this thread - it 's very clear that china competes successfully already with the uk and its offspring . 
  :-) nice one, 
  if you spend a minute thinking about it , there 's an obvious reason why european countries no longer collect data on religion . 
  you can make an approximate cross-reference yourself though , given that the vast majority of immigrants live in more urban/industrial/post-industrial areas . 
  in france there are many benefits to having a third child , i.e. 
  to get your marriage/partnership above replacement rate . 
  a lot of couples have three kids , and lots of traditional french and immigrant families have even more than three . 
  french government policy is very supportive of parents , including helping women get back to work with subsidised childcare etc. 
  in ireland , i think it 's a throwback to previous generations when contraception was difficult to obtain . 
  certainly the irish government could do a lot more to support child rearing . 
  here 's hoping for some decent poetry coming out of brexit . 
  hmmm , let 's see , brexit - sex it - flex it - wrecks it - decks it ... 
  quite close to calais if anyone is passing through and wants to visit . 
  yeah , it 's not gdp you should be looking at . 
   you ca n't just use population statistics to determine a country 's economic/geo-political status . 
  agreed , but if i look at the value of merchandise exports ( 2015 ) , i see this in dollars : china ( 2.1 trillion ) = us ( 1.5 trillion ) + uk ( 0.43 trillion ) + aus ( 0.19 trillion ) the anglosphere alliance would add 0.41 trillion from canada + 0.04 trillion from nz , for a total of about 2.55 trillion , not that much more than china , and without the same level of integrated decision making . 
   china would n't be able to compete with an increasingly close alliance of the uk , usa , canada , australia and new zealand . 
  1.3 billion people wo n't be able to compete with an alliance of ( 64 + 319 + 35 + 25 + 5 ) 446 million people ? 
  it has long been in ireland 's interest to reduce economic reliance on the uk . 
  what 's becoming clear from the current uk government is that it 's also in ireland 's interest to reduce political reliance on westminster . 
   when you call people `` old in fairness now that 's an empirical statement . 
  i would n't refer to people as `` ignorant '' , but i 'd have no hesitation using `` old '' or `` senior '' to describe a cohort of voters . 
  this was one of the premises of * the day after tomorrow * iirc . 
  on a slight tangent : roland emmerich is a bit of a genius . 
   one of the reasons france did not then turn into a customer that simply buys their nuclear stockpile from the us honestly i think it was more to do with being outside nato . 
  but yeah , i see what you 're getting at .
