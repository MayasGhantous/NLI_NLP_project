  i would guess that most fords that are sold in the uk are made in europe . 
  ** edit ** here you go , ford might not be the example you 're looking for :  [ in europe , the cologne body and assembly plant in germany is the main player , producing the fusions and fiestas sold in europe . 
  that plant employs more than 4,100 . 
  kuga and focus models for europe are made at the sarrlouis facility in germany . 
  ] ( https://www.jenningsforddirect.co.uk/car-guides/history-of-ford-cars/where-does-ford-make-cars ) ...  spain is also a significant player for ford 's european manufacturing . 
  they operate a sizeable plant in valencia involved in component manufacturing and assembly of the focus , fiesta , ka , and c-max . 
  ...  it is cheaper , for example , for ford to build their duratec engines destined for european cars in england , and then ship those engines to various assembly plants in europe . 
  manufacturing the engines in the us would cost more and be more expensive to ship . 
   the problem is that the ` benefits ' of the eu are not classed as benefits to a lot of britons . 
  no , but once price inflation kicks in everyone will notice the hidden advantages of the single market . 
  even without tariffs , i 've seen estimates that put the costs of imported/exported goods rising by 5 % to 10 % due to increased administration costs . 
   okay , so why are all the articles so one-sided ? 
  i guess because most of your somewhat cerebral publications are opposed to brexit . 
  ** anti-brexit : ** economist , financial times , independent , guardian , times ( though firewalled , so it 's less influential ) , observer , new statesman , nature ** pro-brexit ** sunday times , telegraph , sunday telegraph , spectator there 's a more complete list [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/endorsements_in_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum,_2016#newspapers_and_magazines_2 ) , but it 's fairly clear that uk media were heavily in favour of remain . 
  in the aftermath of the decision to leave , a publication that backed remain is likely to have the same reasons to continue to back remain , especially given that we have no certainty of the future relationship . 
  may has set out her priorities , and these suggest that the uk will leave the single market . 
  it 's unrealistic to expect the publications who opposed brexit before the referendum to start publishing articles supporting brexit now , particularly given that we are more likely to have a so-called `` hard '' brexit than a `` soft '' brexit . 
   you know it 's just a britain hate fest . 
  i do n't think it is , but you 've made up your own mind . 
   you need a new equation for each calender year no you do n't . 
  just a single equation that calculates compound growth . 
  i 've never doubted french engineering education - i 'm always very impressed both with the depth and breadth of graduates ' knowledge . 
  interesting . 
  i know a couple of people who teach at hec - did n't realise the school was getting so much recognition . 
   it may not end up benefiting anyone ( except maybe the lawyers ) . 
  maybe some lawyers . 
  probably some customs officials and administrators too . 
  unfortunately we 'll all be poorer with the uk out of the single market . 
  time to dust off the asimov books . 
  robotic `` personhood '' seems necessary fairly soon , as we 're already delegating some activities that could result in legal action . 
  but the point of these specific contracts is that they can range from < 15 per week to  40 per week . 
  there are zero guaranteed hours . 
  comments section is full of people who are outraged and are going to close their bank accounts with hsbc . 
  ukip should open a patriotic bank - hell , they already have the pound sign as their logo !, 
  maybe could be a job for nigel as he becomes increasingly irrelevant ? 
  sure , but [ if you look at the picture , it says `` 8.20 '' ] ( https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rpcfsksckz5rpyudlbeldq.png ) thing is , you can get different varieties of paris visite tickets , and one two-day ticket is cheaper than two one-day tickets . 
  maybe he 'll stop by germany when he 's visiting his ancestral homeland of [ moneygall , co offaly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moneygall ) . 
  now home to the [ barack obama plaza ] ( http://barackobamaplaza.ie/ ) , the premier destination in and around junction 23 of the m7 . 
   is / r/europe just one big british hate fest now or something ? 
  no , but it 's dominated by the uk press , and the uk press is dominated by brexit stories . 
  would have been better to separate out the two items in the title with different verbs . 
  unemployment rate falls to 4.8 % . 
  pay growth rises to 2.8 % . 
  out of interest , are people on zero hours considered full time or part time in the stats ? 
  pointless posturing from the british foreign secretary - hollande will be gone in a matter of months , it 's his successor who 'll be administering the brenemas . 
  no , for the forthcoming election exiting the euro is a core promise . 
  and even this has become more nuanced ( gradual withdrawal with a ecu-type replacement ) . 
  she says she 'll stay in the eu if she achieves her goals . 
  [ wall st journal article . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/marine-le-pen-centers-presidential-run-on-getting-france-out-of-eurozone-1484735580 ) edit : i got a reminder about the wsj firewall , here 's the relevant part  ms. 
  le pen says she would spend her first six months in power negotiating with the eu to claw back control over currency , economic policy and border security . 
  at the end of the talks , she would hold an in-out referendum on the eu and only recommend a vote to stay if she had achieved her goals . 
  basic error for paris : 2 + public transport day ticket @ 8.20 = 25.70 i guess they intended 2 x `` paris visite '' ticket @ 12.85 per day , but there 's a two-day ticket for 21.00, 
   palestine ( not a real thing ) ah okay , you 're one of those . 
   i wish you lout would make it the official anthem of england . 
  lout ** s ** , the plural of `` lout '' is `` louts '', 
   i do believe that the native english are suffering from an identity crisis . 
  jeremy paxman was writing about this nearly 20 years ago . 
   rather odd that he 's english yet speaks of english as ` them ' ` the ' and ` their ' . 
    clearly he does n't consider himself english . 
  i would n't read too much into that . 
  it would be fairly standard for an academic writing a piece of this type . 
  he 's a member of the british academy since 2000 . 
  not really , no . 
  the british govt have been insisting on immigration control and sovereignty since july , and both of these imply leaving the single market . 
   but if that 's who you want to support that 's pretty bad . 
  stop making stuff up ; i never said i want to support `` the whole middle east '' . 
  not even sure how i 'd go about that anyway . 
  does the middle east have an embassy ? 
  i asked what relationship israel wants with palestine . 
  just like today 's speech by may , this is not new information . 
  no cherry picking has been a consistent line from the eu , just as a `` specific '' deal has been consistent from the uk . 
  roll on the end of march and some genuine new developments . 
  that 's what the vikings used to do - raid monasteries , steal tech , and kidnap the top minds . 
  sweden reaps the benefits now . 
  the uk also has the highest level of surveillance in europe , iirc . 
  joint fourth globally with singapore . 
  i 'm underwhelmed to be honest . 
  there was nothing in the speech that we have n't heard before . 
  we 've a bit more clarity that the uk will be outside existing arrangements , but even that was fairly well signaled already ( red white and blue brexit ) . 
  that 's odd . 
  they 've rebranded several famous logos ( i recognize lowenbrau , leffe , san miguel , fischer ) with this `` cogan '' name ? 
  here 's the text :  fairness demands that we deal with another issue as soon as possible too . 
  we want to guarantee the rights of eu citizens who are already living in britain , and the rights of british nationals in other member states , as early as we can . 
   i have told other eu leaders that we could give people the certainty they want straight away , and reach such a deal now . 
   many of them favour such an agreement - one or two others do not - but i want everyone to know that it remains an important priority for britain - and for many other member states - to resolve this challenge as soon as possible . 
  because it is the right and fair thing to do . 
  it sounds like the same issue that was discussed last summer - certain countries wo n't discuss how to deal with citizens until art 50 is triggered . 
  this is no different to what we heard before . 
  you 're editorialising . 
  here 's what 's written :  she goes on to to say that she wants to guarantee the right of eu citizens in the uk at an early stage if there is a reciprocal deal for uk citizens in europe - some eu nations accept this will others do n't , she announces . 
  and you 've interpreted this as :  some eu nations are not accepting reciprocal rights on citizens at the moment . 
  lol . 
   not to be exterminated an pushed in to the sea . 
  kind of what the nazis wanted . 
  what ? 
  israel wants ... kind of what the nazis wanted ? 
  but only poland shows a decrease from 2014 to 2015 ? 
  at what time was it posted ? 
  i 've gone all the way back to 09:03 and ca n't find it .
