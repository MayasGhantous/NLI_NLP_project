  if this is structured in such a way as to favour new hires from those already on unemployment benefit ( e.g. 
  for 3 + months or something like that ) , it need n't be discriminatory on paper , even though it would be somewhat discriminatory in practice . 
  the way that kern is phrasing it is disappointing and makes him seem like a xenophobe , but i guess that 's what attracts attention and votes these days . 
  can fidesz also deport everyone who has accepted soros-funded scholarships ? 
  no , but the discussion concerns reddit activity as analogous to citizenship , not residency . 
  deportation in this analogy would be a site-wide ban from even loading a page . 
   `` it would be helpful to the british economy and to british workers who feel they are overlooked because of other people coming into the country getting jobs they would themselves like to get , '' ( goodwill said ) is one grand a year really going to make that much of a difference to british workers ? 
  gbp 83.33 a month , or about gbp 0.53 per hour , will make the skilled british worker more competitive ? 
  she 's being blackballed because she has unpopular opinions . 
  the municipality in question appears to be in contravention of national and cantonal rules , according to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5nb2ds/vegan_activist_says_no_more_cowbell_and_her_swiss/dca6pgd/ ) .

   i was * comparing * something i guessed from your flair to the situation in the thread . 
  where 's the comparison ? 
  you simply said '' ** what about ** the suburbs in paris '' . 
  that 's what makes it * whataboutery * . 
  it 's not an argument against anything i wrote . 
   you state that group-think , conformity and public hypocrisy are `` scary '' no , i said `` scary to imagine a place where people vote on citizenship '' . 
  this will result in `` group-think , conformity ... '' for goodness sake if you 're going to pick apart my post , please read the thing properly . 
   conformity is bad ? 
  too much of it is yes . 
   why would you invite people who follow perhaps the most conforming religion into france ? 
  again with the whataboutery . 
  i did n't invite them , okay ? 
  i 'm not here to defend france . 
   i would be very careful calling direct democracy `` scary '' , when you are living in state of emergency due to the opposite . 
  okay . 
  because i live in france , i 'm not allowed to comment on something that happens in switzerland . 
   your neighbours ( the other users ) , get to vote ( upvote/downvote ) on your right to basically be part of the discussion but you still get to make comments . 
  the shadowban analogy is closer , and from what i 've seen , people who get shadowbanned find it to be a very frustrating experience . 
  does banning dissenting voices create echo chambers ? 
  when did that happen ? 
  more whataboutery !, 
  lol . 
   not up to you or me to evaluate . 
  agreed , it 's up to the swiss government to set objective standards and this person has met those standards . 
  the irrelevant attribute is her mouthiness . 
   discrimination is the act of denying a right . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's simply treating people differently on the basis of some irrelevant attribute . 
  the usage here is correct . 
   i 'm just saying that our societies at our time function only based on the assumption of a certain level of cohesion . 
  that 's a fair point . 
  however , part of the strength of our societies lies in the ability to tolerate and accommodate differing political opinions . 
  what 's happening in this case is quite contrary to that - the woman is being blackballed because she 's mouthy and opinionated . 
  i might not agree with her views , but i support her right to express them without fear of reprisal . 
  pointless whataboutery, 
   this is n't true in the general case . 
  when did i say anything about the general case ? 
  i was responding to this story , as one does on this site . 
  i know that this is a specific case because i read the story . 
  i did n't make any generalization about switzerland . 
  you think japan is without societal problems ? 
  lol . 
  if someone fulfills criteria for a given status , they have the right to apply for that status . 
   yes this concept of integration is a heresy for many but necessary for a cohesive society . 
  sounds like the borg to me . 
  read the article ? 
   and after a detailed examination of the facts , the government came to the conclusion that holten had been wrongly dismissed, 
   are you saying that natural-born citizens of switzerland should n't have say to whom naturalization procedures apply ? 
  no , that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm saying that an individual case should n't be put to a vote among a tiny constituency . 
  i did n't ignore your answer . 
  it did n't make any sense . 
  what do you mean `` generic unspecified ` your ' is where the dishonesty lies '' ? 
   citizenship in switzerland follows a `` jus sanguinis '' philosophy . 
  does this woman meet swiss criteria for citizenship ? 
   and after a detailed examination of the facts , the government came to the conclusion that holten had been wrongly dismissed , '' 2 . 
  did her neighbours get to vote ? 
  that 's already covered . 
  -------------------------- i do n't know what point you think you 're making , but i am most certainly not being dishonest . 
   that generic unspecified `` your '' is where the dishonesty lies . 
  what ? 
  it 's an abstract informal description of the situation . 
  i honestly do n't understand the problem . 
  this woman has requested something that she normally fulfills the requirements for . 
  her neighbours get to vote on whether she gets this thing or not . 
  my formulation : `` neighbours get to vote specifically on your ( or her , or its , or his ) right to citizenship . 
  if you 're being incredibly pedantic , they 're voting on whether or not to validate her/his/its application for citizenship . 
  is that your point ? 
  please stop with the passive aggressive accusations . 
   let 's not be intellectually dishonest here . 
  how about we do n't throw around accusations of dishonesty either ? 
  what i said was `` neighbours get to vote specifically on your right to citizenship '' . 
  let 's take a look at what the article says :  a dutch woman living in switzerland , who has campaigned against the use of cowbells , has been denied citizenship twice by her neighbors . 
   nancy holten , a dutch woman who grew up in switzerland , has applied for swiss citizenship twice . 
   and twice , the local residents ' committee that gets to sign off on that application has turned her down  her neighbors did n't want to give her the `` present '' of swiss citizenship `` if she annoys us and does n't respect our traditions , '' suter told the local . 
   the first time her neighbors reviewed her citizenship application they argued for more than hour , then voted 144-48 -- to applause -- to deny her  the municipal assembly reconsidered her application in november . 
  and for a second time her neighbors turned her down , this time by a bigger margin -- 203 to 59 votes . 
  intellectually dishonest my arse . 
  us politics is a complete clusterfuck on both sides of the political divide . 
  scary to imagine a place where your neighbours get to vote specifically on your right to citizenship . 
  guarantees group-think , conformity , public hypocrisy . 
  the guy pictured is paddy hillery , first irish european commissioner ( 73 - 76 ) and then president of ireland ( 76 - 90 ) . 
  the puns . 
   cause for mellow yellow blazing out  30 were stubbed out  deal with the high demand . 
   the bonger instituut  is blunt  out of joint, 
  good decision from the echr : the parents ' religious freedom is less important than providing the children with a full education . 
  there 's also an [ ashoka chakra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ashoka_chakra ) in the mouseover banner !, 
  that sounds like a user story right there . 
   the company sees itself as a lean business and would be likely to play down expectations of major recruitment .
