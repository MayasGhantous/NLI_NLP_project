  from what i understand there 's not really that much to snapchat . 
  it 's hard to see how throwing lots of devs at the app would enhance it .

   from the global south or ** it 's diaspora ** * triggered *, 
  there 's another aspect to this that is n't mentioned , which is the fn 's attempt to pull away from jm le pen 's `` cotelec '' organisation . 
  this is the organisation that historically raised funds for the fn , but since the rift between le pen p\u00e8re et fille , the party would prefer to attact donations or loans directly . 
  more generally , the fn 's has a serious problem in financial management . 
  it 's continually overspending and getting into debt , plus it 's under investigation for diverting european funds to support national activities . 
  even setting its politics aside , the fn is not a good risk financially . 
   in what way of is she pro russian ? 
  she recently announced that the annexation of crimea was legal . 
  good article - interesting to see the convergence of productivity with the us . 
   there is no other large group of people the number of jews moving to israel from usa/canada is very regularly greater . 
   i wonder why we often get this topic here , then . 
  because [ israel wants to attract more french jews ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/27/israel-urges-jews-leave-france-benajmin-netanyahu-continues/ ) . 
  a few times a year there 's a story like this . 
  the us licensed version was called [ heavy metal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heavy_metal_%28magazine%29 ) magazine . 
  i remember it from comic stores in the 1990s . 
  here 's an [ archive of issues ] ( https://archive.org/details/heavy-metal-magazine ) . 
  edit : the us version is still publishing : http://www.heavymetal.com/, 
  lol . 
  it 's called [ `` plantation '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantations_of_ireland ) because it 's not regular migration at all . 
  it 's more like a fifth or a sixth . 
   britain regardless of how ireland feels is watching over ireland and protecting it , ireland ca n't just shrug it off [ shhhhhh . 
  no tears . 
  just dreams . 
   in my view the irish are pro-eu but also highly skeptical of it compare that with mixed feelings toward britain but also very wary of it , especially w / a tory govt . 
   is public transport in paris good enough to make someone not need a car ? 
  inside paris , yes without a question . 
  the only time i missed a car when living in paris was when i had to bring furniture from a shop to my apartment . 
  for people living in the suburbs , the transport can be very variable . 
  the rer ( suburban rail ) is very slow and prone to problems . 
  the regional trains ( ter ) tend to be a bit better but can be very crowded . 
  that said , it would take me minimum 90 minutes to get to my office by car , up to 120 minutes during rush hour , whereas i can definitely be there in 70 minutes by public transport , and could do it in 55 with a quick bus connection . 
  guns look like sigs . 
  * am faoilleach * in scots gaelic is an interesting one . 
  it may derive from * [ faol ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faol ) * , an archaic term for wolf . 
  perhaps meaning the time when wolves became more visible because lack of food drove them to scavenge near human settlements . 
  more generally , [ faoilleach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faoilleach ) has a specific meaning in the agricultural calendar , as the period that marks the transition from winter to spring . 
   why become ? 
  influx of russian jews since collapse of ussr caused a rightwards lurch of israeli politics . 
  the founders of israel were a good mix of the political spectrum ; since the 90s though israel has been dominated by right wing hawks . 
  she 's said she will trigger art 50 by end of march but if she 's setting out her position now she should simply get on with it . 
  the uncertainty is n't good for anyone . 
  i had to look up miss helsinki on google . 
  the neo nazis at `` daily stormer '' are upset too . 
  that 's disappointing for everyone - the eu and the uk - but life goes on . 
  she should trigger article 50 and start negotiations now ; put an end to the uncertainty . 
  i thought it was quite funny . 
  the article mentions someone commenting that it 's not as good as * four lions * , but i 'd rate it about the same . 
  not constant lolling , but some decent laughs . 
  anyway , comedy should be provocative . 
  oh yeah stiffy is a better descriptor , but in much of the anglosphere that term already meant something specific ... 
  lead by fleet buyers but not consumers . 
  in south africa the 133mm disks were called `` floppy '' but the 90mm were called `` stiffy '' disks . 
  i ran a few customer trainings there in the late 90s and i could n't stop giggling when people talked about `` stiffies '' . 
  this is a very `` current '' look - long hair with the large lensed glasses . 
  yes , but his age is given in the title and this is the key information . 
  do you know anyone who 's over 100 years old ? 
  i do n't . 
  anyone i know who 's over 90 is ill-equipped to stay on a bicycle , let alone do over 20km in an hour . 
  you 've lost me . 
  what do you think `` sets new record '' means ? 
  it does n't imply `` beat everyone else younger '' . 
   it has to do with democracy if the decision of the bank was motivated by a political influence . 
  doubtful . 
  it 's a russian bank and if anything the russians are pro le pen . 
  the bank that issued the loan has been dissolved , so presumably they want to wind up its outstanding loans . 
   i see little reason to believe she is a carbon copy of her fathers ideology so why not rename the party ? 
  no it does n't . 
  the bbc title is :  french cyclist robert marchand sets new record aged 105 a `` record '' can be a personal best , a category best , a world best , etc. 
  there 's no mention of competing against other people . 
  on balance this is good news . 
   if lidl would use country-by-country based advertising it would be more expensive and contrary to lidl 's business plan . 
  do your parents know you 're on the internet talking nonsense ? 
  i 've never hit my kids , but i 've never thought there was a need to . 
  raising my voice has mostly had the needed effect . 
  i was often physical with them when they were little , but only to restrain them when necessary . 
  i 'm not majorly anti spanking , though there 's something quite unseemly about an adult hitting a child . 
   the fact not included in the clickbait title . 
  it 's not clickbait . 
  how many 105 year old cyclists do you know ? 
  many of her new voters are attracted by the new image presented by the fn ( youthful , media-genic , assertive ) . 
  this image costs money to maintain . 
  just what the paris real estate market needs to kick it out of the doldrums ... ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  jumping ship did n't work out for the sdp : 22 out of 28 lost their seats in the 1983 election . 
  unless an mp is really well established in a given constituency , the party machine will generally be stronger in the next election . 
  in that case you 're just ranting . 
  saying `` labour should elect a leader who appeals to a majority of the electorate at large '' while you 're aware that a labour leader must be elected by a majority of party members is pointless . 
  i might as well say `` the lib dems should bring back paddy ashdown '' as leader for all the good it will do . 
  labour adopted a new leadership selection method in 2014 . 
  it might have shot itself in the foot in doing so - at least with corbyn this appears to be the case , but we 'll have to see longer term . 
  as things stand , to have a successful labour party post-corbyn , they need a candidate who appeals to the party as well as to the public . 
   it should aim to win a general election not appease a voter base this suggests you do n't understand how the labour party works . 
  this is a masterpiece . 
   i think the railbed ( and maybe the stations ) should be owned by a single railway company that 's highly regulated by government . 
  the uk tried [ railtrack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/railtrack ) as a private company but it did n't work out . 
  the rail network was renationalized as [ network rail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network_rail ) which is not far off what you describe though it 's in public ownership . 
   labour needs a charismatic leader that can appeal to the centre ... ... while also appealing to a majority of the rank and file party membership . 
  the fn has become very slick and mediagenic .
