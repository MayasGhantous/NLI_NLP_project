   now let me ask you this , if a western educated muslim can be radicalized from a country taking action to protect its citizens or even go so far as to recognize there is a problem with the status quo , what conclusion does it lead to about that muslim ? 
  i think you 're missing a word or two here because i ca n't understand the sentence . 
  i 'll answer this :  if a western educated muslim can be radicalized from a country taking action to protect its citizens ... what conclusion does it lead to about that muslim ? 
  this depends entirely on the ` action to protect its citizens ' . 
  if the action is increased army presence , then your imaginary muslim is dangerously overreacting . 
  if the action is summary internment and execution without trial , then i 'd conclude the muslim has good reason to become radicalised . 
   if that muslim ends up facilitating or participating in an attack on their own country , what trust do we have for these people , as per your description of ` marginalization ' ? 
  again , this depends on what the host country ( or native country ) has done , does n't it ? 
  it 's strange that you criticize me for refusing to mention what marginalisation might consist of and then in your hypothetical example - intended to probe my view of muslims - you fail to say what measure your imaginary country has taken . 
   your post has led me to conclude that you are propagating the notion that if they are as much as criticized , they would be more likely to kill their own countrymen . 
  you 're massively over-interpreting my original statement , and you 've failed to understand an important distinction : 1 . 
  what i think . 
  what i think that terrorist organisers think . 
  here 's where you missed it :  as these muslims get marginalised , ** in theory , ** they become easier to radicalise and use as pawns in the muslim terrorist ` movement ' . 
  i 'm saying that the current strategy is x , and that according to the theory that underlies this strategy , y will happen . 
  but maybe you were skim reading and not a sufficiently scrupulous reader . 
  i would n't hyphenate that : there 's really no need . 
  anyway , it 's not a diversion as i am compounding his/her lampooning of me by claiming a further `` decoration '' in english language . 
  i 'm passing on some useful information about terms used to describe academic vs military honours . 
  if you need to criticise me , at least do it correctly . 
  [ the fecking ~ ~ jesuits ~ ~ italians have it all tied up ] ( https://youtu.be/hx2sjbtwqvi ) . 
  i think over 80 % of popes have been italian . 
  even francis is the son of italian immigrants to argentina . 
  just stating a fact . 
  it 's not a left fact or a right fact , and there 's no need to look at it in those terms . 
  farage 's behaviour would have been considered beyond the pale 20 years ago . 
  edit : oh now i get it . 
  you 're one of the altright . 
  lol . 
  infallibility did n't start until the 19th century , mate . 
  it wos the first vatican council wot defined it . 
  in a more civilised time someone would have taken it on himself to horsewhip farage . 
  what a vulgar piece of trash . 
  how do you ` separate ' a group that 's already present within a society without going full nazi ? 
  plus there 's a billion muslims on the planet and unless elon musk gets his act together super sharpish we 're all stuck on this same piece of rock . 
  i put my faith in the ability of western consumerism to eventually overwhelm religious conviction . 
  he could be a violent psychopath with problems anticipating future outcomes and poor impulse control . 
  looking for a rational explanation for his behaviour maybe a waste of time . 
  there 's good evidence of a ` high king ' of ireland from the ninth century to the eleventh century . 
  after the time of brian boru , the high kingship is still there in theory but is n't supported unanimously . 
  it was an english pope , adrien iv . 
  iirc there is some doubt as to the authenticity of his `` order '' anyway . 
  middle easterners have coffee ; north africans usually mint tea . 
  thank you . 
  i also have a reddit certificate in english language , and for a degree we would normally say `` someone so qualified '' . 
  the term `` decorated '' is used for military or civilian honours such as medals . 
  these terrorists want us to give up our freedoms . 
  they want us to turn on each other on the basis of religion . 
  they want sectarianism , mistrust , fear of the other . 
  they want to drive a wedge between those from a christian background and those from a muslim background . 
  the basic strategy of muslim terrorism since the start of this century is to cause outrage in western societies and marginalise muslims within these societies . 
  as these muslims get marginalised , in theory , they become easier to radicalise and use as pawns in the muslim terrorist ` movement ' . 
  good for you . 
  life goes on . 
  okay . 
  here you are : not everyone who is concerned about a violent tragedy can be a `` paramedic at the site '' . 
  they can nevertheless do things to express their concern , such as giving blood at a local clinic . 
  anyway , you 're not the person i asked the question of . 
  you 're just a random ghoul . 
  not an answer to my question . 
  saw some friends in berlin check in ` safe ' and i 've seen some references to prayer for berlin , but i agree it 's a lot less than previous . 
  but nice may have seemed less pronounced to some people than paris . 
  how do you know that the people doing image overlays are n't also doing other things irl ? 
   angela merkel bore responsibility the guy who bears responsibility for the attack is the perpetrator of the attack . 
  you can criticise merkel 's policy , you can argue that she made the possibility of such attacks more likely , but she is not responsible for the attack on the market . 
  claiming that she is responsible minimises the responsibility of the killer , who is a human being who made choices to ram a truck into a crowd . 
  rundst\u00fcck is brilliantly ( non ) descriptive .

   all to often politicians use the phrase to push their own political agenda rather than out of concern for my rights . 
  but  our democratically elected leaders set out a series of rights . 
  are you saying that the politicians in your first statement are not the same as your democratically elected leaders ? 
  clearly you have a problem with echr and ecj . 
  you also apparently have a general problem with `` politicians '' , but you seem to think ** your politicians ** are okay ? 
  why are your politicians so different from other politicians ? 
   all to often politicians use the phrase to push their own political agenda rather than out of concern for my rights . 
  this sounds like an argument in favour of supranational entities that define and defend rights , such as the un declaration or the echr . 
  the main reason they voted to leave was to stop seeing so many poles !, 
  er , i mean `` polls '' !, 
  which wikipedia entry ? 
  edit : never mind i found it . 
  seems ptolemy used it once but later corrected himself . 
  that 's simply repeating `` not british isles '' ( civilised ) vs `` british isles '' . 
  now give me three ways to unite ireland ? 
  it 's up to the uk secretary of state for ni to determine whether a referendum will be held in ni . 
  it 's not wholly up to the people of ni . 
  this is good for the uk . 
  the process would be even more of a shambles if a large proportion had already changed their minds . 
   similarly , modern day ireland was called `` little britain '' in ancient times . 
  i 've never heard this . 
  are you sure you 're not thinking of brittany ? 
  ireland was called hibernia by the romans . 
  they also called the irish * scotti * , which has evolved into scottish . 
  the ** brythonnic ** speaking celtic tribes that lived in britain were the original british . 
  the goidelic speaking tribes that lived in ireland ( and invaded scotland ) were the original gaels . 
  both islands were probably occupied before celtic migrations but we have very little information about those people . 
  who initiates the process for the six counties to join the republic ? 
  celtic archipelago .
