  did you expect the eu to abandon principles that have formed the basis of the treaties since the 1950s ? 
  anyway , your question was `` why brexit delayed this ? '', 
  i 've tried to answer that . 
  how good/bad a deal cameron got was a discussion for earlier this year i think . 
  this is the guy who went skinny dipping with farage after the latter retired from politics . 
  that 's okay , it 'll drive up the wages of uk university staff ... and if anyone loses their job in a business that exports to the eu , they can get a new job as a researcher at the university ... 
   you guys have to really start checking the migrants ' age more properly cut them open and count the lines ? 
  ^ ^ ^ / joke, 
   as we correctly suspected at the time , the eu was doing exactly what it pleased no , that 's simply not the case . 
  the eu was willing to go with cameron 's request for indexation . 
  now the ec is saying that indexation is more trouble than it 's worth . 
  one item in it is contrary to what cameron had negotiated vis a vis family benefits . 
   finally , we will keep the rules as they currently exist for child benefits . 
  ...  there are very strong arguments , not to go for indexation : it would be a major bureaucratic exercise to set up such a system , while actually less than 1 % of child allowances in the eu are exported from one member state to another . 
  presumably had the cameron deal gone ahead , the commission would have been obliged to recommend indexation for everyone . 
   do n't be so dis-ingenious lol,

   among other things , the berlin institute screened the academy-award winning film ida ( 2015 ) , whose main protagonist finds out , in 1960s poland , that she is jewish , and that her biological parents had been murdered by their neighbors . 
  however , poland 's ambassador in germany przy\u0142\u0119bski requested the screening of the propaganda film smolensk instead .
