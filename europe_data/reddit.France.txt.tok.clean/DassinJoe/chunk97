  oh come along mr scrooge !, 
  spirit of christmas and all that !, 
  doggo walked away with it . 
  are we believing surveys again ? 
  what a genuinely poxy thing for a trade union to do . 
  pretty much diametrically opposed to the principles of the trades union movement . 
  do they deny muslims membership ? 
  agreed , but the problem in the uk is that ** nobody ** has prepared for brexit . 
  at least with scoxit , the snp would 've had some sort of plan . 
  the euroskeptic wing of the tory party is not new - they 've been around for donkeys ' years - but they 've nevertheless got themselves and the country into a situation where you 're making it up as you go along . 
  it 's the height of foolishness . 
   after rent , food and some buffer deducted i 'd be left with around $ 1300 of `` disposable '' income . 
   now even if i wanted to take a lease for a new car how much would you spend ? 
  i could borrow 30k from my bank and pay back 540 per month for 5 years . 
  i love it when politicians talk about technology like it 's omnipotent . 
  heaven forbid that parents might have a role in teaching their kids the dangers of sending nude photos to other people . 
  no , but they 'd be asking why the snp did n't ( if it did n't ) . 
  if they 're letting assistants wander outdoors along downing st holding ministerial notes face out for the inevitable cameras , it 's most probably deliberate . 
  or it 's just pure amateur hour , which i 'm reluctant to rule out entirely . 
  did you read the final two paragraphs ? 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motion_picture_production_code  basically you would `` socialize '' people to see `` family lifestyle '' a more attractive social option . 
  you 'd `` teach '' women that they should work outside the home less and bear more children ? 
  how many kids have you had out of interest ? 
   that 's how it has always worked . 
  define `` always '' . 
   those are n't the french that are having kids in france . 
  if you look at the net migration data alongside the fertility rate data , you 'll see that you 're mistaken . 
   have you been to paris ? 
  yes . 
  i 'm there right now . 
   and all of them are economic , and not cultural what does a cultural pronatalist policy look like ? 
   point me to any country in all of world history that has managed to raise its shrinking birth rates purely through economic incentives . 
  france : [ graph ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=fr&amp;v=31 ) , [ explanation ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/22/france.jonhenley1 ) . 
  [ overview ] ( http://europa.eu/epic/countries/france/index_en.htm ) out of interest , how do you think germany 's birth rate has gone in the last 10 years ? 
  this is a good idea : it 'll give british kids options to go find jobs when they leave school . 
  it 's either an inelegant plant or a sign of gross incompetence on the uk govt 's part . 
  europe already has plenty of overtly pronatalist policies . 
  here 's [ an article ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4837422.stm ) from 10 years ago about them . 
  germany has gone from a fertility rate of 1.37 children per woman in 2006 to [ 1.5 last year ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/fertility-rate-germany-rises-33-year-high-births-children-population ) . 
  there 's nothing wrong with being explicit about the need to raise birth rates , so long as you 're not focusing only on aryans or some nonsense like that . 
  i agree that facebook should n't police `` news '' or `` fake news '' , but it does bear responsibility to police the advertising that it accepts . 
  the `` macedonian '' media outlets spent heavily on advertising to get their fake stories out there ; the companies that took this money bear some responsibility for the dissemination of the stories . 
  the point is that a certain section of the traditional left vote will never vote fn . 
  this is mostly older people and it 's for the reasons i 've outlined . 
  you can fuss and fume about it all you want , but the fn are still considered traitors by some old guard leftists and gaullists . 
  you wo n't change that while trying to keep the traditional fn vote on side . 
   most french workers are n't unionised , so fucking lol . 
  but most french companies deal with unions . 
  as a result , even though union membership is very low , most people are employed based upon union agreements . 
   asinine logic that barely deserves a response but here you are , avoiding every question i asked with a lot of bluster and condescending claptrap . 
   it is like saying the ps no it 's not . 
  you 're deflecting . 
   why did n't the progressives in the democratic party in the us i do n't know and i do n't care . 
  you 're deflecting again . 
   so your argument is clearly stupid . 
  and yet you 're afraid to answer any of the simple questions i posed . 
  why is that ? 
  one data point ? 
  how many kids have you had ? 
  citation ? 
  answered already . 
  it 's not absurd at all . 
  consider three simple questions : 1 . 
  is jm le pen a vichyite ? 
  was the front nationale traditionally vichyite ? 
  why has n't mlp founded her own party , or at least renamed the fn ? 
  as to whether it 's `` counter-productive '' , i do n't think so . 
  in this discussion it is very relevant . 
  traditional leftist voters over a certain age will never vote for mlp because the fn is a vichyite party . 
  it does n't matter how `` socialist '' she portrays herself , she still smells like a fascist to them . 
  she does better among younger voters who do n't have the same associations . 
   in retrospect that would have been an absolute masterstroke i think jospin 's defeat was due to fragmentation of the left that time . 
   a catholic thatcherite over an anti-immigrant anti-eu secular ^ vichyite, 
  fill your boots . 
  i agree completely . 
  i think it 's a good sign from the swiss electorate . 
  berlin -- swiss voters rejected a plan to accelerate the country 's exit from nuclear energy in a referendum sunday , turning down an initiative that would have forced their government to shut the last plant in 2029 . 
  the plan promoted by the green party would have meant closing three of switzerland 's five nuclear plants next year . 
  polls ahead of the referendum had shown a tight race , but voters shot down the initiative by 54.2 percent to 45.8 percent . 
  under switzerland 's direct democracy system , proposals need support from both a majority of the country 's cantons ( states ) and of the national vote to pass . 
  only six of switzerland 's 26 states backed the nuclear shutdown plan . 
  after the fukushima nuclear disaster in japan , the swiss government adopted a gradualist approach toward transitioning the country to renewable energy by 2050 . 
  it said nuclear plants should continue to operate as long as they are deemed safe , but did n't set a precise timetable . 
  the government said it needs time to switch to other sources such as wind , solar and biomass energy . 
  if successful , the initiative would have limited the lifespan of nuclear plants to 45 years and meant the closure next year of the beznau 1 , beznau 2 and muehleberg reactors . 
  the newest of the plants , in leibstadt near the german border , started operating in 1984 and would have had to close in 2029 . 
  the nuclear plants currently generate around a third of switzerland 's electricity . 
  `` we would have liked to win , that 's clear , but 45 percent for ` yes ' is a good result , '' regula rytz , the greens ' chairwoman , told srf television . 
  her party is n't part of switzerland 's broad coalition government . 
  `` the problems have n't been resolved with this referendum sunday , '' rytz said . 
  `` we will keep at it on safety , on financial security ... and on expanding renewable energies . '' a group representing swiss business , economiesuisse , said in a statement that `` a hasty exit from nuclear energy would only have brought disadvantages for switzerland . '' it welcomed what it described in a statement as `` voters ' clear signal for a secure electricity supply and strong domestic energy production . '' neighboring germany took a sharper turn away from nuclear power after the fukushima disaster in 2011 . 
  it plans to shut down its nuclear power plants by the end of 2022 . 
  the referendum result `` is a disappointment for all who had hoped for clarity on when the last nuclear power station in switzerland will go offline , '' rita schwarzeluehr-sutter , a deputy german environment minister , said . 
  nuclear power is `` an outdated model in switzerland , too , '' she said , adding that the country has some of the world 's oldest reactors and `` their days are numbered anyway . '', 
  we ca n't expect any better from a man whose only electoral success has been in european elections . 
  he 's a living embodiment of hypocrisy writ large . 
  mama and papa are close to innate for various physical reasons . 
  very astute . 
  thanks . 
  fuckin ' experts man ?
