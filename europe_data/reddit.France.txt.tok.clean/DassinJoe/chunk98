  fuck them !, 
  that 's a good description . 
  shambling would be the word i 'd use to describe his demeanour . 
  boris 's grandfather or great-grandfather was turkish iirc . 
  fair enough - i think the coulisses blog is part of the lib\u00e9 infrastructure . 
  he 's a journalist with liberation covering european news for 26 years . 
  no idea if he 's pro- or anti-uk , but he 's more than a blogger . 
  exactly . 
   with the uk out of the eu , he no longer has any reason to be against turkey joining the eu . 
  he was also paid by turkey to support their membership application some years back . 
  there 's an advert floating around . 
  wow , thanks !, 
  i was n't expecting that . 
  i 'd have thought london would be more expensive , but my experience of `` back office '' jobs for big banks is that the majority of staff are not very well paid . 
  i note that he 's blaming brexit for a problem that was already apparent in march of this year . 
   paris could be an attractive option to move small groups of well-paid traders who are on expatriates contracts , but not for back offices with thousands of people , kyril courboin added . 
  i would n't fancy trying to pay paris rent on a back office salary .

  because collective punishment for individual actions is compatible with that system ? 
  [ ireland did this in 2002 ] ( http://www.housing.gov.ie/environment/waste/plastic-bags/plastic-bag-levy ) : a levy of 15 cents per bag . 
  immediate effect was to reduce annual plastic bag use from ~ 328 bags per capita to ~ 21 bags per capita . 
  it fell further to ~ 14 bags per capita in 2014 . 
  more importantly , when you drive around the country now you do n't see plastic bags stuck up every second tree , slowly disintegrating in the wind . 
   france have similar problems to uk from early '80 that 's hilarious . 
   a few years back we had a campaign what was the outcome ? 
   our state does not play the nanny when it comes to things like this , it is at your own digression * if you wish to make your child a possible target for ostracisation/ridicule in the future . 
  this is from 2007 : [ italian court : child can not be named friday ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2007-12-20-friday_n.htm )  since city hall officials are obliged by law to report odd names , the matter ended up before judges in genoa , the northern italian city where the couple live . 
   last month , an appeals court stated that friday falls into the category of the `` ridiculous or shameful '' names that are barred by law , because it recalled the native servant in daniel defoe 's novel . 
  this sounds quite similar to the situation in france . 
  \\* discretion is the word you 're looking for . 
  a * digression * is a temporary departure from the subject at hand . 
  no , i never said they would n't be considered mass murderers . 
  i said i would n't ban the names . 
  if mr and mrs mussolini tried to name their child benito , would the italian authorities respond that it 's not in the best interests of the child ? 
  yes , but you have to pay paris prices , whereas your sister can benefit from [ other french region ] prices . 
   how do you define who is a mass-murderer ? 
  [ ** mass murder ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_murder ) is the act of murdering a number of people , typically simultaneously or over a relatively short period of time and in close geographic proximity . 
  mohamed merah killed seven people , including three children , over a period of eight days , within a radius of about 30 km . 
   will you stop people naming their kids leopold , or winston , or george ? 
  i presume the references are to the belgian king , british pm , and us president ? 
  i understand that you may consider them ultimately responsible for atrocities carried out in their names , but they did n't commit the acts themselves , and the * acts are not the only thing that they are known for * . 
  if he had n't killed seven people , including three children , merah would likely be a complete non entity . 
  in addition , leopold and winston were active a long time ago . 
  merah killed people four years ago . 
   the surname mohamed the first name mohamed . 
  ( surname = family name ), 
  a colleague used to live in sauve . 
  he told me about the trees they use for growing pitchforks . 
  it 's pretty cool . 
  in ireland , from 300-400ce we are still in the proto-history phase . 
  [ ogham script ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ogham ) is the only known form of writing . 
  the people were [ pagan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_polytheism ) , practicing some form of polytheism . 
  the calendar was based upon midpoints between the solstices and equinoxes , with four main religious festivals each year : imbolc ( february 1st , start of spring ) , bealtaine ( may 1st , summer ) , lughnasadh ( august 1st , autumn ) and samhain ( november 1st , remembered by the hallowe'en festival ) . 
  the legal system is [ brehon law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_irish_law ) . 
  the country was emerging from a period known as the [ irish dark age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_dark_age ) , from 100 bce to 300 ce , which appears to have been marked by a decline in human activity and population . 
  society was organized on a tribal or ` clan ' structure ( * clann * being the irish word for family , btw ) . 
  there was arable farming alongside dairy farming . 
  cattle were highly prized and served as a form of currency . 
  cattle rustling was common - [ * the t\u00e1in * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%a1in_b%c3%b3_c%c3%baailnge ) , a famous legend featuring the hero c\u00fachulainn , is built around a cattle raid . 
  in 367 , irish forces ( scotti ) participated in the attack on roman britain known as the [ great conspiracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_conspiracy ) :  in the winter of 367 , the roman garrison on hadrian 's wall rebelled , and allowed picts from caledonia to enter britannia . 
  simultaneously , attacotti , the scotti from hibernia , and saxons from germania landed in what might have been coordinated and pre-arranged waves on the island 's mid-western and southeastern borders , respectively . 
  franks and saxons also landed in northern gaul . 
  [ niall of the nine hostages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niall_of_the_nine_hostages ) appears to have died sometime between 350 and 420 . 
  he 's considered the founder of the o'neill dynasty , which is very important in irish history . 
   early in 2006 , geneticists at trinity college , dublin suggested that niall may have been the most fecund male in irish history . 
  of their irish sample , the geneticists found that 21 percent of men from north-western ireland , 8 percent from all of ireland , a substantial percentage of men from western and central scotland , and about 2 percent of men from new york bore the same y-chromosome haplotype . 
  from 400 , we detect christian influence , with the [ first bishop arriving in 431 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_ireland#early_christian_ireland_.28400.e2.80.93800.29 ) , sent by the pope . 
  the historical record becomes much richer from here on , though it 's very focused on churchy activities . 
  in the late 400s , the [ kingdom of d\u00e1l riata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a1l_riata ) was established covering part of northern ireland and western scotland . 
  in the 500s , [ brendan the navigator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brendan ) discovers america before anyone else ^ ^ ( ^ ^ maybe ) . 
  much of the 6th century history is about monasteries being founded by irish monks , including [ clonmacnoise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clonmacnoise ) , [ glendalough ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kevin_of_glendalough ) , [ clonard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clonard_abbey ) , [ aghaboe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abbey_of_aghaboe ) , and [ iona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iona_abbey ) in scotland . 
   under a french law , the official registrar may intervene in baby naming in cases where the state deems the name is not in the best interest of the child . 
  damn straight . 
  putting a mass murderer 's name on a baby should be considered not in the best interest of the child . 
  in fact , they should be wondering whether staying with these parents is in the best interest of the child . 
  a couple per day plus three on sundays and we should be all done by christmas . 
  happy winter you crazy ice ( landic ) people !, 
  [ french fork-tree museum ] ( http://www.miroplus.net/museum/conservatoire-fourche/ ), 
  the methodology is quite unclear - it mentions a ` web survey ' but i could n't find a link to more detailed results . 
  that said , there is likely a demonstration effect from the brexit fallout that makes people in other countries more likely to support eu membership .

  le pen appeals to former socialist voters by promising to rebuild france 's industrial base outside the euro and eu .

  nobody has been elected on a platform of `` i will take clandestine money from russia '' . 
  you 're an apologist . 
  last time i looked britain planned to leave anyway . 
  doubt that it matters a fuck what this guy says . 
  what does `` power over westminster '' mean in this context ? 
  it 's the court , not the government , that says westminster must be consulted . 
  the party that controls westminster has been overruled by the court in its bid to avoid consulting westminster . 
  if the scottish position is never considered , that may remain grounds for further appeal . 
  i did n't say anything about conspiracy , just hidden communication . 
  instead of having heil hitler on his arm , some guy puts 88 . 
  there are many ways to explain it to colleagues or to his boss . 
  they wo n't bother googling ' 88 ' if he says it 's some rock group or sports thing , but to other neo-nazis he 's instantly recognisable .
