  old people are defiant to gemany . 
  young people do n't care much , unless they actualy met a german dude , and then they think they are too , how to sound not too bad .

  well , all others , exept their own country . 
  they 're traitrerous scums . 
  we are eager to try a lady for pr\u00e9sident .

  it 's like the dollar collapse because of vermont state . 
  i read your first sentence and i did not understand why so many downvote on a pro eu sub .
