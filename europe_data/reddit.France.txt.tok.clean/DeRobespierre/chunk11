  they were ahead of their time . 
  do n't have any reason . 
  and i still do n't understand how this was a law athorised by constitution . 
  as it is a born privileged right . 
  edit : phrasing, 
  for uk i do not known . 
  finland , people i think are concentrated in the coast area ? 
  come on , be reasonable , if only qualified people was there , how could we entertain our-self with sexual harassment ? 
  hey !, 
  i was n't invited to this !, 
  nobody told me shit . 
  and by the way , where are all the gentlemen 's manners ? 
  the ladies should have the first strike . 
  the action movie music is a bit too much ... 
   it would impose new sanctions on russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses , supplying weapons to syria 's government if only they choose islamists like the us did , in afghanistan , in syria , and pretty much everywhere . 
  tl , dr :  tajani 's plan , which also involves switching the budget cycle from seven years to five . 
  less people spread to cover . 
  [ mentioning this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4el5x8/czech_republic_aims_to_be_called_czechia_in/?ref=search_posts ), 
  ask czech republic about that !, 
  everybody knows that terrorists discuss their plan in the public eye , and with the tongue of the natives . 
  * for sure . 
  did you not heard ? 
  that 's was the fault of the people , they buy too many shits they did not deserved . they wanted heath and education for their children . . 
  these rascals do not known what 's good for them . 
  and by the way , capitalism flourish always better under the social democrats . 
  conservatives always tries to put some legislation to protect their culture in some way.no good for business . 
  nop . 
  i watched a bit of the post results show , it 's always the same song . 
  `` turnouts is low , blabla , terrible for democracy , blabla '' then , they 'll be in their hot seats , comfortable , to discuss ~ ~ witch ~ ~ which groups deserves tax cuts , how many bombs will be sent to spread democracy . 
  and lives will go on . 
  wow man , that enormous amount of text , with lots of example and augment caught me by surprise in a hot sunday evening . 
  you force me to answer . 
  it 's always uncomfortable to compare my country to a federal state . 
  it 's not the same game . 
   the focus might instead have been on opposing her speculations.her victory would have create a such chaos and terror among the main stream parties , that nobody could see the outcome . 
  all bets are off . 
   about supporting or opposing the sitting president it 's a new thing in us politics , for long , they 've been pretty consensual about the presidential election.and it 's due to international and internal affairs , not the electoral system in place . 
   a party that did n't even exist before is now projected to win a large majority of the seats that is the key.and not just the `` new part '' thing . 
  it 's an old ... dream in the population , that for once , all the good ideas from the left and from the right merge into one politic ( backup by many , many surveys along the years by +55 % of people ) . 
  that 's what e.m !, 
  did . 
  unfortunately for them , that 's not how politic works , the schr\u00f6dinger experiment will fail . 
  as to move forward , fast and with strength , people have to go in one direction . 
  `` half of the french who can vote '' . 
  and it 's no more a title , but a paragraph . 
  the 7 and 5 years gap was no relevant , as the president if the majority was against him , was able to dissolve the parliament . 
  yes , the wait of two month is a nonsense . 
  it was set up some time ago from politicians from a time gone . 
  i can not find justification of it . 
  maybe to avoid a different party alignment between the president and the parliament if it were happening at the same time . 
  but this argument can use to say the opposite . 
  i ca n't wait the documentary on tovarish president putin from o. 
  stone . 
  `` drama ''  he was taken off the train for questioning and eventually released . 
  drama is people fucking dying , their body and flesh crushed by truck , explosion or bullets . 
  words have meaning . 
  crimea was a part of russia . 
  if russia want to invade all a country , they known how to do it . 
  have faith in them . 
  [ well , if we did n't , you do n't even exist to critic that behavior .

  not sure they will start counting people again , in case they start turkish `` bath '' programs . 
  nice showcase put together but  `` delinut '' i do n't care how much poor you are , that 's just heresy . 
  that 's gon na be wonderful , as well as e.u handle the borders , their southern neighbours , peace , prosperity and little rainbows . 
  the funny part for me is on the top `` emergency of a european retaliation against terrorism '' . 
  i was asking to myself , it is a good sign or a bad sign of our time ? 
  ca n't blame you , all this sun can be uncomfortable . 
  i wanted to write `` feminists '' but i wanted to be as inclusive as possible . 
  so i put half the world 's population . 
  ca n't beat that . 
  opps beat , trigger word . 
  there are legal drugs , or anything else with black market . 
  cigarettes for example . 
  so your easy solution does not solves all problems . 
  well , i must say it 's the brand of great leader . 
  we had these kind too . 
  `` look at car accidents , it 's worst '' . 
  they are weak , unable to understand the world , and have no reflection or solutions to problems . 
  one death causes the first world war . 
  it 's not about numbers , it 's about consequences on common people lives .

  poor italy b ` ( they just do n't speak the same language everywhere . 
   partisan snap election undermine democracy . 
  too much democracy can kill democracy ? 
  as we can see the state of the world , it 's a problem that many would gladly have . 
  in my country , some claim proportional representation is the only true form of democracy , others claim two-round system is the way to go . 
  and crazy talk about sortition , which is not even democracy . 
  there are no pure form of democracy , only the ones which works with the people they rule . 
  the same story in every country , just the name changes . 
   higgins [ now that 's a name i have n't heard in a long time ] ( http://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/jonathan-higgins-magnum-pi-john-hillerman.jpg ), 
  i did miss the prelude `` with all respect , nothing to do ... '', 
  because their weapons was overheating , inaccurate and heavy . 
  so they did prefer the german one . 
  like when you stole nazi scientists to go to the moon . 
  when you stole indian lands for some bottles , it is a habit that persists . 
  it was my main interrogation , thanks for that . 
  no , it 's [ a failed monarchy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bourbon_restoration ) who lasted less than 16 years .
