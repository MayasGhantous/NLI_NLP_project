  it miss the name of the places he visits .

  germany , efficiency !, 
  all these lazy gals pregnant who could work !, 
  here 's a free idea , put a sticker on her ass `` do n't shoot baby on board '', 
  it 's a mention in my source , i reminds you most of catholic names comes from latin , and latin refers to roman culture and civilization . 
  you never watch `` 10 surprising things you did n't known about france '' ? 
  yeah it should be `` awesomeness '' martin : from latin martinus , the god of war . 
  patrice o'neal comes to mind . 
  a light bulb ?

  [ someone ] ( http://crooksandliars.com/files/primary_image/15/09/dick_cheney.jpg ) did , and made a lot of money . 
  * if * saddam hussein was still there , you and i , would not even talking about this . 
  the western troops can leave whenever they want , and at the pace they want . 
  unlike the iraqi people . 
   no #prayforburmingham trending in bagdad well , i call it a false equivalence . 
  as in iraq , i am not sure people living there have power and running water everyday . 
  fair enough . 
  not everybody , for the same reason as south american , those are anti-communist and anti-russia . 
  no #prayforkabul or #prayforbagdad , strange is it not ? 
   habsburg wars ho ze germans again . 
  i get it .

  great move . 
  my grandfather was from spain . 
  two things he did n't like : priests and communists . 
  man !, 
  the citadel is a joke !, 
  please elaborate . 
  i was quite surprise to be so low . 
  what about all these ships , hoarding gold from the new world ? 
  any communist party who take a more nationalistic stand , like in china or yugoslavia is a good thing . 
  as soviet union used to sacrifice pawn for their own interest . 
  no flags , no bagpipes , no nothing . 
  just sadness . 
  here some history : [ northwoods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northwoods ), 
   in italy in the 70 's that 's i had in mind . 
  yes , the beast has escape the control of his master.like bin laden with the usa . 
  and of course , we are not talking about tanks and planes . 
  we are talking about money , shelter , mosques , ideological support and intelligence . 
  he is from the generation of cia coups in south american , over throne democracies there ( and selling drugs ) , financing leftist terrorist in europe , and islamism terrorist in afghanistan . 
  `` las palmas ii '' sound like vacation . 
  the eu wo n't last a 1 000 years i can tell you that .

  ... ^ ^ ^ fly ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ fools, 
  same with history , as we learn less and less of our own , they teach that the americas were discover by spain . 
  i understand more the joe rogan routine about texas . 
  i paraphrase `` only the toughest bastards stayed in texas , the rest of us went to the beaches ( american frontier ) . 
  if something goes wrong , we gon na need these people . '', 
  edit : word, 
   norway is one of the best run countries too bad most people show finland on a map when they think of you ... or is it sweden ?

  [ pneumatic bro ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9socd3v1tya/t4kvtxxanki/aaaaaaaab00/lnuo5wtq0vw/s1600/pneumatic-tubes.jpg ) , unhackable !, 
  yeah , only the orthodox can match the bling bling of catholics . 
  thanks , a good refreshing of something i used to known . 
  la terreur , is more a period than a specific person . 
  danton was naughty boy . 
  as a layer from the conseil of the king , he may have lots of sympathies for the monarchists . 
  secretively negotiating peace while shouting for the crushing of their armies . 
  an kind of himmler in the of the war . 
  anyway , that a big fuss for 30 000 death only.what a joke . 
  but they died with style . 
   a guy who decapitated everyone who disagreed with him disgusting rumor spread by monarchists . 
  he is a marvelous example of what happened in war . 
  he was a good bloke against death penalty and a good believer of the king . 
  until he witness his nation plagued by civil war and over-border war financed by monarchists and some german mercenaries . 
  and shit got real . 
   they 're not english a mistake from my part . 
   civilised people wo n't be having religious war any time soon until they do . 
  here a quote i like `` peace is a moment between two wars '', 
   why do they have to go ? 
  they are the ones to prevent reunification , they settle there for that reason . 
  and still preventing it . 
  we get rid of the english in a century . 
  ho and , did i forget ? 
  there is the religions problem too . 
  settlers plus different religion , hum , i wonder witch other country that reminds me . 
   the colonies were established and maintained by companies , and not the government well , i am sure the separation was not so strong .
