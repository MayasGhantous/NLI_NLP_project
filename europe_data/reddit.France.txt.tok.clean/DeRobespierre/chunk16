  every time something happening in france or else where , politicians go on tv saying that we 'll reinforce bombing on syria , and up the rank of emergency by +1 . 
  it 's a communication tool . 
  since 1995 and the 1st bombing in the metro , was created `` vigipirate '' . 
  then `` reinforced vigipirate '' , then '' scarlet vigipirate '' and so on . 
  nerver stoped one terrorist . 
  he announced * a task force * ( in english in the text ) against isis . 
  guess what , 7 different police department have terrorist jurisdiction already . 
  gon na be a 8th one . 
  wait a minute islander , not a mere king waving hands at a balcony , he was imperator francorum , rex italiae !, 
  and a great general . 
  all of this from a dry island , a rise from the common people to the higher rank , unseen for a millennium . 
   neapolitan talking about this one . 
   but it 's a lazy one ho geeez . 
  it 's their general tendency to shorten words and sentences , like the date they use.the only example coming right now is instead of centipedes , they use `` pedes '' . 
  closer to catalan ? 
  if i did n't known and see that sentence for the first time , i 'd thought it 's a forbidden language to summon an old god . 
  p\u00ea\u00f4pl\u00ea \u00fbs\u00eeng \u00e0cc\u00eant h\u00e4v\u00ea \u00e2ll my s\u00fcpp\u00f4rt . 
  that was interresting . 
  i notice the neapolitan are the american , choppin ' word and mispronounced them b )  m'hann ritt ch ` arrivamm l'unnc that 's read and sound so not latin . 
  it was revealed in 1994 . 
  welcome to the [ 90 's ] ( http://quefaire-api.paris.fr/images/4679 ), 
  francois holland and his party was a advocate for euro bonds.nothing happened against lebensraum of the $ . 
  he participated in the occupied france vichy regime . 
  he had a double life , fucking a 19 years old while married and 40 . 
  made a pact and killed the communist party . 
  got cancer few month after election . 
  get reelected seven years later . 
  choose jacques chirac instead of the party leader of the party he created . 
  his kind shaped in wars and international troubles do not exist anymore . 
  white supremacist international hand signal !, 
  he is uncovered !, 
  you saw ? 
  all things on bills are fake , and the 500 $ was made only for german people . 
  you understand this money will not last for a 1 000 years . 
  i did the math , my money will stay on hookers . 
  i do n't trust the turks since the fall of constantinople . 
   suddenly decided they did n't like the nazis well , they had great wardrobe , all that leather and design . 
  i understand the hesitation . 
  serbia numbers are ... odds , to say the least . 
   a sort of a chicken-or-egg scenario is it important if it ends the same way ? 
  tito was a pretty bad ass . 
  resisting the most powerful man in the xxth century , and lived it.shame i did not learn a thing from him at school . 
  it 's was all about est germany . 
  my mistake . 
  i was talking about general point of tensions against turkey . 
   i am the leader of one country which has two alphabets , three languages , four religions , five nationalities , six republics , surrounded by seven neighbours , a country in which live eight ethnic minorities . 
  j.b tito all you need is a good european leader , right ? 
  and things go smoothly . 
  `` a movement to get rid of non germanic influences '' i can see a pattern here . 
  i do n't speak neither of them , but i can tell dutch is waaaaay worst . 
  do n't forget the vikings ; they went over there for their favorite vacation spot . 
  saperlipopette !, 
  super special power : la reyne le veult . 
  deal wiz it . 
  i knew after ww i , western countries took a lot of their lands . 
  i though they sided more or less with the iii reich . 
   turkey remained neutral during most of world war ii , but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the allies on 23 february 1945 but they played smart . 
  i do n't really believe in neutral country , just cunning ones.like , ho well , like present days with isis . 
  i would bet portugal get the higher age . 
  nope , but close . 
  vai portugal !, 
  damn , it not just only about cyprus . 
  armenian , kurdish and now greeks . 
  ~ ~ allied with ze germans during ww ii ~ ~ wrong . 
  how the hell turkey did n't get crushed , cut in piece little germany . 
  history showed that in the ivth r\u00e9publique ( proportional ) , lots of small parties and 24 governments in 11 years . 
  yes , that 's why eurostats exists . 
  i dont understand they use insee . 
  bloody thursday for me . 
  fyi : the system how calculate unemployment was changed in 2007 . 
  there are at least 5 different categories of unemployment ( a , b , c , d , e ) . 
  only one is present in that graph . 
  and at last , the number do not show the big gap between two spectrum of population : +55 years old and - 25 years of with high rate in these categories . 
  indeed . 
  the 1 300 years old royal `` family '' of france is here to testimony . 
  but we are not talking of blood change , are we ? 
  here is the problem for the senate . 
  it 's independent . 
  so change must come from itself ( no regular law can change the senate ) . 
  as it is composed by its own electoral system , by conservatives . 
  the alternative is a referendum . 
  the most vocal voices for change comes from the left . 
  they are very uncomfortable with referendums , as they say for decades it 's a populist system ( \\ #thanksdegaulle ) . so you can see the maze . 
  i indeed use `` someone from ireland '' for the whole place . 
  it is a angle i have . 
  for my country was too was claim by the crown of england , most part of it . 
  but when i talk of france of that period , i mean the hexagon of today without thinking an instant it was an english land . 
  ever . 
  that 's means in the area the left in not strong enough in the first place . 
  what 's the worst scenario ? 
  every left parties do the exact same score distributed among them.preventing the access of the 2nd round . 
  again , that 's mean left is not strong enough to drawn voters to one party to represent them . 
  and do not forget , in additions to general politics , they are many cross-purpose ( grumble ? ), 
  between individuals on local interests and behavior on the left . 
  i guess my unwritten words spoke for meself . 
  just explain to me how a member from [ `` a minuscule band of terrorists '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/29/archives/how-to-punish-the-ira.html ) can be a first minister and deputy first minister , a northern ireland executive ? 
  in my country , the only one labeled as a terrorist who did that was that [ bloke ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/bundesarchiv_b_145_bild-f010324-0002%2c_flughafen_k%c3%b6ln-bonn%2c_adenauer%2c_de_gaulle-cropped.jpg ) . 
  the m\u00e9lenchon doctrine is , and was the socialist party doctrine for long time . 
  we go on our separate list ( ecologists , communists and socialists ) list , and the one on the left with the best score , we withdraw our lists and support him ( for the 2nd round ) . 
  but this global doctrine can not be done anymore because some s.p members are closer to the right and other to him .
