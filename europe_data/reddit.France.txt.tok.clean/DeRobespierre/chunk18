  so that 's mean you can blame the parents ( i do not if it applies in this case ) , but can do . 
  it do not mean they may be the only one to blame : the cops , the judicial system , and other government agency for that failure . 
  shame is an important part of any society . 
  [ look ] ( http://www.journaldugeek.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/12/donald-trump-1.jpg ) around you those who had no shame , and witness how they behave . 
  it is not a nation indeed . 
  and there is also , inside eatch country different forces battle each other . 
  especially separatist , in spain , in uk , in belgium , and i am sure in the eastern also . 
  an army , is bound to its people and it leaders , or set of values . 
  and even then , in cultural similar ethic people there has been great divide within nation like urss ( red revolution ) or usa ( session war ) . 
  so now you want to apply this in the most diversic area of the world . 
  it is not confident you need , it 's a religious unquestionable faith . 
  because many of my people and i , will do anything for that eu army will never happened while our own land is under attack . 
  '' / s '' is the brand of the weak , the coward and the unholy . 
   why would france even teach something like that . 
  it 's a combination of many things . 
  imo , it 's due to catholics influence of colonial guild . 
  `` stations of the cross '' in a way , self deprecation , clean consciousness of guilt . 
  be too long to explain . 
   which is why i support common european army hell and damnation . 
  the european chimerical traveled so far est. 
  you putting your life and your way of life in the hand of a bureaucratic , under equipped and not related to your homeland . 
  do not take my anti eu bias , just look at the facts . 
  see how the borders of the most developed country in the world have been handle by this bureaucrats for the last 20 years . 
  you now witness the decisions made 20 years ago . 
  funny you talk about that . 
  in 2011 , there were a `` reform '' on school books for 11-15 years old students which remove some big historical figures some kings and the great napol\u00e9on ier ( 1804-1815 area ) . 
   kaunas there is no mention at all in the french wiki page about napol\u00e9on . 
  it 's bad man , these classes are replaced by `` historical diversity about africa '' to please the immigrants population from there . 
  it started like this , taken away your history ( even the bad stuff happened ) , changing your way of life , the food you eat , the way the people dress . 
  and you must accept it or you 'll be blame for your '' ~ ~ interference ~ ~ '' `` intolerance '' . 
  i do n't known the political context in poland and in hungary , but they take a lot of shit from ~ ~ mean ~ ~ main stream media here . 
  and my hope is , in some way the eastern country will rise and stop all these shits happening . 
  in western europe , we are weak , in debt and with a lot of old people ( coward cunts ) . 
  i known some you over there had a terrible historically relation with russia . 
  and the american are pushing their pawn over russia . 
  here a little testimony , the last two presidents where pro nato , and this new one is too . 
  and the way of life is n't better , getting worst with terrorism and unemployment . 
  because your country is a paradox . 
  in one hand , you have puritans wasp who ca n't say dirty words on tv , ca n't bare the view of janette jackson nipple . 
  and on the other hand , you have the biggest porn industry on the god damn planet earth . 
  deal with it . 
  hey !, 
  do n't blame me !, 
  i known where georgia is . 
  why ? 
  cause stalin was born there . 
  i know where pakistan is . 
  why ? 
  because they are in conflict with india over kashmir . 
  blame my school system !, 
  cheery on top , with transsexuals only , cause regular male or female had enough attention . 
  it 's doktor goebbels , please be respectful for philosophy . 
  ho my , what a turn of events . 
  a german dude making troubles in austria , for a change . 
  arabian refuge with a kinda ~ ~ ju ~ ~ jewish name . 
  thanks for the context . 
  how fascinating , it is for politicians whatever the bloody country they are from , to avoid scandal by cheap tricks by creating noise around them . 
  maybe they 'll ban porn but gay porn . 
  that would be fun and very `` progressive '' . 
  are they trying to compete with the americans about playing with words and renaming things and removing flags and portrait ? 
  anyway , renaming stuff it 's an old german game . 
  the best known is this one : deutsche arbeiterpartei to nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei . 
  but really , changing name do not change things . 
  it 's changing people . 
  i checked where lithuanian actual were ( apart some vague knowledgeable of russia 's border , which was dead wrong ) . 
  and i saw that big poland next to you . 
  ho , poland ... maybe some influence . 
  and you confirm it . 
  paradox do not shackle humor . 
  and for that , i am grateful . 
  it 's the magic of the words . 
  in one case you have a criminal denomination + victim noun . 
  in the other case a neutral word `` sex '' and a positive attitude `` survivor '' . 
  two negatives against one neutral and one positive . 
  some people get paid good money for that kind of magic transformation of words . 
  i 'm quite curious to known how the ~ ~ hell ~ ~ catholic church survived in your distant frozen lands . 
  not at all . 
  it 's just more challenging for the working class . 
  and , they are never bored with their life , they have so many shits to do since their young age . 
  and i am not talking about choosing between piano lessons or dance classes . 
  their job for long was to see their children passed the age of 20 . 
  that 's why their made a lot of child , to be sure at least one or two grow old . 
  90 % of the time , french people never heard of the pm before . 
  he is just here to get fire if anything goes wrong . 
  nobody elected him , nobody care for him . 
  we elected a president , only him is accountable for the next 5 years . 
  you do not understand , it 's an allegory to the conditions of ireland at the time . 
  salty ? 
  how dare you ?

  [ and some tricks ] ( http://a407.idata.over-blog.com/4/08/45/08/sans-titre-numerisation-01-copie-2.jpg ), 
   emma outlined how she went from a nice quiet family to hanging out with the pakistani gang in rotherham a little tired of your bourgeois life ? 
  here some adventures . 
  i am triggered you are assuming their gender . 
  they have done a marvelous job so far . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  listen to  --  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/8nghhl6dhok ) . 
  writing music while deaf , they can arrest illegal while blind . 
  damn , i though you northerners do better than lazy latin scums like us . 
   it 's a shame that kind of news does n't really reach us here though .
