thus , according to this fine philosopher , a thief , a destroyer , would have been the benefactor of mankind , and we should punish an honest man who says to his children , `` let us imitate our neighbour ; he has enclosed his field , the beasts will no longer ravage it , his land will become more fertile ; let us work ours as he has laboured his ; it will aid us , and we shall improve it . 
  each family cultivating its own enclosure , we shall be better fed , more healthy , more peaceable , and less unhappy . 
  we will endeavour to establish a distributive justice , which will console our unhappy race ; and we shall be raised above the foxes and polecats , to whom this babbler would compare us . '', 
   would not this discourse be more sensible and honest , than that of the savage fool who would destroy the good man 's orchard ? 
   what philosophy therefore is that which says things that common sense disclaims from china to canada ? 
  is is not that of a beggar , who would have all the rich robbed by the poor , in order that fraternal union might be better established among men ? 
  [ big blue blob , with a bunch of other stuff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dqdtuvg.png ), 
  til the ussr actually lost ww2, 
  racist and sexist , nice one, 
   russia ( because despise separatism ) meh , they recognize two non-un separatist states , and actively support a few others, 
  he is trying to use it as a justification . 
  look at this guy 's history , he 's a nazi apologist piece of shit . 
  facts not real , only feels , right ? 
  i 'm sorry that the idea that homoseuxality may not be completely useless for the human specie bothers you . 
  obviously , being exclusively gay is n't very useful at the individual level , but maybe for the group it is . 
  or maybe the alleles predisposing to homosexuality give evolutionary advantages to the people who have them , but engage in heterosexual sex . 
   from an evolutionary standpoint it 's not very useful to be homosexual or maybe it is . 
  it 's just `` boy '' , not `` young boy '' . 
  the stuff about 20 yo students is in the book , it is n't something he claimed after the controversy erupted . 
  and in the chapter he is actually offered `` young boys '' by a taxi driver and declines , and think about how french tourists have a reputation of being pedophiles . 
  partitionium would be a great name,

  hmm , no , it 's 2 kisses in bordeaux . 
  could we get the illyrian provinces back plz ? 
  yes , but nagorno-karabakh is clearly not `` made up by russia '', 
  i do n't see what does this have to do with russia, 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/armenian_empire.png/800px-armenian_empire.png gib back plox, 
  yes you are , you 're clearly happy your country does n't recognize the genocide of those `` armenians bandits '' . 
  strange thing to be proud of . 
  why would libyans go to bangladesh ? 
   now i know in france , ready to go does n't really compare . 
  the best deal you could get there is maybe $ 30 a month for 1gb of data , and free texts to french numbers . 
  nah , not anymore . 
  since 2012 , we have 20 $ / month plans with unlimited calls/data/sms ( but you have to buy your phone at full price ) . 
  they joined 15 years ago , that 's not really relevant to their european-ish status, 
  a small part is geographically in europe . 
  and it 's part of the council of europe . 
  that 's a joke about how we all eventually die, 
  * are n't we all temporary residents ? 
   yes they do especially in countries where they do n't require a prescription . 
  it 's stated in the article and all over the internet . 
  lol , `` it 's stated all over the internet '' . 
  that 's not true , period . 
   women especially young ones are popping this like candies no . 
   a ( mainland ) french citizen moving to a collectivity ? 
  none , it 's like moving from paris to bordeaux . 
   a schengen citizen moving to a collectivity ? 
  european citizens have automatically the right to stay and live there . 
  but ( at least in polynesia ) unlike mainland france where you get basically the same rights than a french citizen , you will need a work permit to get hired , and unless you have in-demand skills you will have a very hard time getting it . 
  overseas departement yes , overseas collectivites no . 
  overseas collectivites are part of france , but they are n't part of the eu . 
  but , to make things more complicated , the inhabitants are european citizen ( because they 're french citizens ) , so they can move in the schengen area , and vote in the european parliament elections . 
  very inaccurate . 
  french overseas collectivities are an integral part of the french republic ( unlike e.g. , the british overseas territories that are n't part of the uk ) . 
  http://www.breizh-info.com/2016/01/15/rennes-biotrial-bialessai-therapeutique/ the website is pretty sketchy and i do n't know if it 's actually true , but it 's in the normal price range . 
   attacks in europe by palestinian nationalists, 
   thing is all of those were caused by local native european historical/political/ethnic / independence movement/etc no , you 're forgetting the israeli-palestinian conflict . 
  nope . 
  deaths due to terrorist attacks in france : http://toutsepassecommesi.cafe-sciences.org/files/2015/11/cumulative_dead.jpeg, 
   how is this so hard to comprehend exactly ? 
  i dunno , it looks like actually reading the article is too hard for you . 
   were supportive  an active part in the killings if you want to cherry pick , at least pick something relevant . 
  what the article actually is about :  more than 95 % of lithuania 's jewish population was massacred . 
  [ ... ] historians attribute this to the massive local collaboration in the genocide by the christian locals . 
   should i be blaming france for surrendering to nazi german ? 
  i mean clearly if they surrendered virtually without a fight that means they supported them , right ? 
   a few thousand out of 3 million suuuuure . 
   estimating the number of deported homosexuals is nearly impossible , because homosexuality was not something that was tracked by any official data except by the data of the deportation and extermination machinery . 
  so it was n't tracked , except it was tracked . 
  flawless logic . 
  people werent deported in france for being homosexual , period . 
  so you 're making things up , without any evidences backing your claims ? 
   only a few years ago , a ump mp caused a scandal in france by claiming , against very clear evidence , that this did n't happen [ 1 ] . 
   did you actually read that wikipedia article ? 
  it says he is right ... outside of alsace-lorraine which was annexed by the 3rd reich , people were n't deported just for being homosexual . 
  til . 
  in french it 's * paradis fiscal * , tax heaven . 
   ethnic russians were oppressed the whole time just because they were white lmao that 's some fucking amazing / r/badhistory, 
  sure we might gain a few years of life expectancy over the next 15 years , but he was talking about the usual / r/futurology bullshit , not that . 
  or much more likely , life extension technologies wo n't be available in 10-15 years, 
  around 80-60 bc , after the seleucids and before the romans, 
  or poutou , or arthaud . . 
   the only reason you 're free is because they fought for your freedom . 
  what does this have to do with the op 's claims ? 
  are you drunk or something ? 
  this doesnt change the fact that the overwhelming majority of the soldiers of the western front were white . 
  calling this `` uninformed and ignorant '' bad history is just moronic . 
  when people upvote bullshit like that just because it looks like anti-racism , yeah that 's a circlejerk . 
   i feel saying that `` the european part of the conflict back then had mostly white europeans '' is both uninformed and ignorant, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/51f5j3 ) is one of the most upvoted post . 
  that 's definitely counter-jerking wayy too hard . 
  no it 's not , open a history book ... 
  well ... 
  do you believe that the western europe who invaded the baltes to force their middle eastern religion in them really deserved to be saved ? 
  and what about exterminating minorities ? 
  it 's actually using data from a book by * murat bardak\u00e7\u0131 * ( who himself does n't believe it was a genocide ) , directly quoting talaat pasha . 
  you 're really making a fool of yourself . 
  http://www.armeniancause.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/n1-new.pdf page 6 and 8 . 
  you can see that except in k\u00fctahya , where [ faik ali ozansoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faik_ali_ozansoy ) refused to carry out the deportations , and in aydin , where of the armenians of smyrna were also spared ( probably not to antagonize to greek population ) , armenians from western anatolia were also deported . 
  actually , you could even say they were much more deported than the armenians from eastern anatolia , who were mostly murdered before reaching the syrian desert .
