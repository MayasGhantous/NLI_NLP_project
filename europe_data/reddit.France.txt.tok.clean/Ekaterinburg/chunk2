  thanks !, 
  i spent two hours on it , but i perfected my translation skills haha, 
  i do notice that black people smell differently , probably a matter of hormones + alimentation i guess ? 
  the language bias quite simply ruins any interest this chart could have had . 
  ** philippe poutou ** , new anticapitalist party ( nouveau parti anticapitaliste ) it was close for philippe poutou . 
  the npa candidate gathered in extremis the sponsorships , allowing him to begin his second presidential campaign . 
  just 50 years old , philippe poutou will try to best his 2012 candidacy , which had allowed him to gather 411,160 votes for the first round ( 1,15 % ) . 
  similarly to five years ago , his campaign is bound to be difficult , facing concurrence from jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , who is attracting voices of the far-left . 
  however , with a casual style and a pc-less speech , the candidate has , compared with five years ago , earned both fame and sympathy . 
  a long-time far-left activist , the candidate led his first fights with worker 's struggle before joining the revolutionary communist league , which became the new anticapitalist party in 2009 . 
  a ford mecanic at blanquefort ( gironde ) , where he is a cgt union member , he is still fighting his factory 's shutdown . 
  ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon ** , unsubmissive france ( la france insoumise ) for the second time , jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon hopes to make a new voice on the left heard by being a candidate to the presidential election . 
  a long-time member of the ps , against which he is now an opponent , jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon has been successively a general councillor of essonne ( 1985-1992 and 1998-2004 ) and a senator of essone ( 1986-2000 and 2004-2009 ) . 
  under the lionel jospin government , the unsubmissive france 's candidate was minister delegated to the teaching of trade between 2000 and 2002 . 
  following the 2002 election , jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon founded , with henri emmanuelli , new world , a leftist branch of the ps . 
  he then campaigned for the `` no '' to the 2005 constitutional treaty project referendum . 
  denouncing the `` liberal drift '' of the party and a critic of fran\u00e7ois hollande , he left the ps in 2008 alongside nord 's mp marc dolez . 
  the two officials then founded the party of the left . 
  m. m\u00e9lenchon , a european parliament mp since 2009 , was then a candidate to the 2012 presidential election under the leftist front , reaching fourth place with 11,10 % of the vote . 
  it is under a new flag , that of unsubmissive france , that he is a candidate to the 2017 election with a candidacy marked by more green ideas . 
  ** emmanuel macron ** , onward !, 
  `` neither right nor left '' , never elected , but an ex-minister , the youngest of the candidates to the presidential election is now one of the scrutiny 's favorite . 
  an ena graduate , emmanuel macron began his career in the public administration as a junior finances inspector and started a flash path : in 2008 , he becomes the junior rapporteur to the jacques attali commission , set to revive the country 's economic growth . 
  he soon joins the rothschild business bank , where he is quickly promoted to partner . 
  his `` the-banker-from-rothschild '' nickname is bound to stick . 
  in 2012 , emmanuel macron reintegrates the public function and his appointed junior general secretary to the elys\u00e9e , before joining bercy as minister for the economy , where he will lend his name to the bill for growth , activity and economic justice . 
  though still a minister , he launches in april , 2016 his movement en marche !, 
  and resigns from the government on the 30th of august before officially announcing his candidacy . 
  ** marine le pen ** , national front ( front national ) the front national 's president reaches her second presidential campaign after having , in 2012 , obtained 17,90 % of the vote for the first round . 
  before beginning a political career , jean-marie le pen 's daughter was a lawyer to the paris bar before joining the national front as legal council . 
  in 1998 , mrs. 
  le pen became regional councillor of the nord-pas-de-calais region and was elected to the european parliament in 2004 , to which she was re-elected in 2009 and 2014 . 
  marine le pen succeeded her father , leading the national front from 2011 onward . 
  she is now ahead of the polls with a program pleading for national preference and exit from the eurozone . 
  she saw her campaign hit by several inquiries into her party and her close friends . 
  ** jean lassalle ** , let 's resist ( r\u00e9sistons ) a candidate since march 2016 , the bearnese official succeeded in gathering the required 500 sponsorships on the very last day . 
  an ex-traveling companion of modem 's fran\u00e7ois bayrou , jean lassalle will thus live his first presidential campaign . 
  a candidate under the banner of the r\u00e9sistons movement , he defines himself as `` the defender of both rural territories and a humanist ecology '' . 
  m. lassalle was elected mayor of lourdios-ich\u00e8re , a 160 inhabitants small village of pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-atlantiques in 1977 at age 21 . 
  he then became mp of pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-atlantiques in 2002 , before being re-elected in 2007 and 2012 . 
  jean lassalle has made himself known for his thirty-nine days hunger strike in 2006 as a protest against accous ' total factory displacement to the lacq basin , located 65 km away . 
  in 2013 , he travelled france on foot and walked more than 6000 km to go `` meet the french '' . 
  `` i did n't think the hatred of politicians would reach such a level '' , he had noted at the end of this march . 
  he was remarked earlier this year for his one-hour meeting with bachar-al-hassad is damas , alongside two lr pms . 
  ** beno\u00eet hamon ** , socialist party ( parti socialiste ) he is one of the surprising victors of the parties ' primaries as well . 
  in january , the ex - * frondeur * ( socialist mps opposed to the goverment 's policies ) won against manuel valls in the second turn of the left 's primary , making him fran\u00e7ois hollande 's successor as the parti socialiste 's candidate to the highest investiture . 
  his roots to the left have been assumed by beno\u00eet hamon since his youth . 
  early on , he was a militant within sos racisme , before joining unef , the main student union , to which he stayed close . 
  a minister delegated to the social and solidary economy ( 2012-2014 ) , then for education ( april-august 2014 ) , m. hamon expects to stand out from the past five years . 
  he built his campaign on a measure in particular : the set-up of a universal basic income . 
  he will wear , aside from the socialist party 's colors , those of the greens after yannick jadot , who won the green 's primaries , rallied to m. hamon back in february . 
  ** fran\u00e7ois fillon ** , the republicans ( les r\u00e9publicains ) city councelor , regional councelor , deputy , senator , minister , prime minister . 
  since his beginnings in politics in the 1970s , little to no level of power escaped fran\u00e7ois fillon 's rise . 
  save for the presidency of the republic , which he pursues after a surprising victory at the right 's primary in november . 
  the deputy of paris , however , has seen is campaign upset by the alleged fictional employment of his wife penelope as a parliamentary assistant affair . 
  said affair has led hip to be indicted on the 15th of march , even though he has previously said he would renounce his candidacy should such a situation occur . 
  m. fillon opted for a program of `` breakthrough '' with measures heavily inspired from liberalism : end of the 35h work week , 65 years old retirement , suppression of 500,000 public workers ' jobs and the tax on fortune ( isf ) , a revision of the work code , or a reform of the health care service . 
  ( debout la france ) an ex-member of the rpr , the rpf and the ump , nicolas dupont-aignan left the latter in 2007 on a background of disagreements with nicolas sarkozy before his designation as the party 's candidate to the 2007 election . 
  57 years old , he has been the mayor of yerres ( essonne ) since 1995 , deputy of essonne since 1997 , and president of the community of the val d\u2019yerres-val de seine agglomeration . 
  an ena graduate , he participated to several ministerial cabinets , including that of fran\u00e7ois bayrou ( 1993 and 1994 ) when he was minister for education , and that of michel barnier ( 1994 and 1995 ) when he was minister for the environment . 
  as a candidate to the presidential election for the third time -- he reached 1,79 % of the vote in 2012 -- he hopes , claiming a gaullist inheritance , `` to open a new way '' between mrs. 
  le pen and m. fillon , `` between drama and false break '' . 
  ** jacques cheminade ** , solidarity and progress ( solidarit\u00e9 et progr\u00e8s ) at 75 , he will be the elder of the election . 
  jacques cheminade , who considers himself the `` anti-establishment '' candidate , is a graduate from both hec and ena . 
  his meeting with controversial american politician lyndon larouche , classified as far-right , gave a new turn to his political carreer . 
  he founded , in 1996 , his faction-like party , solidarity and progress , close to the climatosceptic , homophobic , complotist american ideologue . 
  in his programme , m. cheminade advocates an exit from the european union , nato , the eurozone , and a return to the franc . 
  he defends very seriously the idea of moon colonization and mars exploration as well . 
  this candidate is used to the exercise : in 1981 and 1988 , he failed twice to gather the 500 sponsorships before finally succeeding in 1995 , obtaining 0,28 % of the vote ( and seeing his campaign accounts invalidated ) , and 2012 ( 0,25 % ) . 
  in 2002 and 2007 , he attempted again to become a candidate , to no avail . 
  ** fran\u00e7ois asselineau ** , republican popular union ( union populaire r\u00e9publicaine ) his capacity to gather the required 500 sponsorships is one of the surprises of this campaign . 
  fran\u00e7ois asselineau , 59 years old , is a hec and ena graduate . 
  he began his carreer as inspector of finances , then worked within several ministerial cabinets in the 90s . 
  he was part in 1999 of the rally for france and the independance of europe ( in french rpf ) founded by charles pasqua and philippe de villiers , then , in 2004 , of the union for a popular movement ( ump ) . 
  he resigned in 2006 , `` by opposition to its european line and its aligning to the united states . 
  '' in 2007 , he created the republican popular union , a sovereignist movement supporting a french exit of the european union . 
  he was a candidate to the 2012 presidential election but failed to reach the required 500 sponsorships , obtaining 17 . 
  five years later , he has succeeded . 
  his frontline measure is the `` frexit '' , the french exit from the european union . 
  ** nathalie arthaud ** , worker 's struggle ( lutte ouvri\u00e8re ) the candidate of lutte ouvri\u00e8re ( lo ) , nathalie arthaud , will live her second presidential campaign , following that of 2012 . 
  she had then obtained 0,56 % of the votes . 
  four years earlier , in 2008 , she had become the national speaker of lo , following the iconic figure of the troskyist party , arlette laguiller . 
  in 2009 and 2014 , she was a candidate to the european elections , where she obtained 0,84 % and 0,85 % of the vote , respectively . 
  she was a candidate to the legislative elections elections of 2012 in seine-saint-denis , where she obtained 2,47 % of the vote . 
  her goal : `` to make the workers ' voice heard '' . 
  the 47 years old economics teacher hopes to embody a `` class candidacy '' which will allow `` workers , unemployed people , and the exploited to defend their interests , as opposed to the bosses and shareholders who build up millions and millions . 
  to be a candidate to the french presidency , one has to fulfill several conditions , the most well-known of them being the 500 `` sponsorships '' ( parrainages ) from people detaining an official responsibility such as mayor or member of a city council , mp , etc. 
  the last day to present one 's sponsorships to the constitutional council was today , which means that we now know who will definitely be a candidate to the 2017 election . 
  they are :, 
  hehe, 
  the standards of racism might be different from what you 're used to . 
  do n't forget that racism being a social behavior , it is the society that defines what it is and is not . 
  you may be applying expectations where they do not apply . 
  with that said , i understand your frustration and hope you 'll be doing well . 
  one third is hard right and would vote le pen . 
  one third is center-right and would vote macron . 
  one third is specifically voting for fillon because of his traditional profile and if he wzs '' t there would n't vote at all . 
  simple , i guess ? 
  because in that case they 'd both eat dicks ... t. 1 le pen , t. 2 macron for the win , according to the current mood . 
  honestly no one cares .
