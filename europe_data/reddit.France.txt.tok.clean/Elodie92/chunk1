as for being defended and normalised , it is a miracle - i repeat - miracle , how tolerant western society is today . 
  yeah , my grandfather was born in a very small rural village in france and there are actually a lot of rivalries between people living in his village and the one a few hills up north , between the people living in his department and the ones living across the river or between families in his own village ( when he died , we gave all his books to the local library but offered the mayor to keep some books he liked because he had helped us a lot and he was accused by half the village of pillaging our grandfather 's house behind our backs , we even had to write a letter saying that his side of the story was indeed correct ) and since the region is popular with english tourists , there 's also some resentment towards them . 
  and people act surprised that those people do n't like migrants , they 're basically living in clans and allow nobody outside their small-ish family , friends and war veterans circle to come even close to their home . 
  even if most people are n't that ridiculous , i agree it 's a miracle the eu is even a thing , i 'm even surprised france is a thing , must have been tough uniting those people under the same banner . 
  but if you do n't like them , you can safely ignore them . 
  some of the most cringe-worthy aspects of us society are creeping in ( tumblr feminism , black lives matter , super vegan , the pc crowd ) and if they 're more vocal than harmful , it 's getting a tad annoying . 
  he could steal a car i guess but if he did n't know how to drive at all , he would n't have gone very far . 
  even then , since the swimming pool would be only open to muslim burkini-wearing women , they would n't really be part of the muslim community , a tiny fraction of the female radical muslim one . 
  way i see it , there are only two kinds of stabbings , murders , etc. 
  if you try to stab your boss , lover , ex-boyfriend , rival , a neighbour you hate , etc. 
  you have a motive , it does n't mean it 's right and i hope you 'll rot in cell for some time but at least you were never really a threat to people who were n't your target , there 's something reassuring when that happened , you were never at risk . 
  random stabbings ? 
  random shootings ? 
  it 's a matter of being at the wrong place at the wrong time and that sucks hard , the only difference between a multiple stabbing and a mass one is probably that police caught his ass pretty quickly and thankfully limited the number of casualties . 
  this time it was them but it could have been anyone else and none of them `` deserved '' it . 
  well , not that people deserve to be stabbed anyway but you get what i mean , being targeted because someone hates you and being target because you happen to be there or exist does n't feel the same . 
  it 's a mass stabbing attempt , 7 person getting stabbed is a bit more than you 'd expect from a targetted stabbing . 
   well , i do n't recall i was talking about some 30 years of community service . 
  that was here before you edited your message , 
  community service is to get people back on track , it 's not a 30-years slave contract . 
  hell , look at the french revolution , we pillaged tombs , excavated bodies and paraded them around , stole relics to sell them , beheaded any religious statue , beheaded statues depicting the king and royal families , dismantled castles and churches to build other stuff . 
  i 'm sure lots of important buildings have been destroyed over time by peasants and the likes to build houses , pave roads or build bridges . 
  of course some sites were protected so it does n't mean nobody cared but i think the main reason we still got some priceless heritage sites is that the ignorant people rarely left their village up until recently and we 're now thankfully more educated . 
  so the choice is either a 30-years sentence ( twice what some people get for manslaughter ) or get away scott free ? 
  they have to be punished , , we 've all been teenagers and we know they 're probably more sorry about getting caught than for doing whatever they did but the sentence has to fit the crime , it 's vandalism , not mass-murder . 
  few months in jail if they 're repeat offender , some community service if they 're first-time offenders , maybe something related to the relic they broke so they can learn with their tiny brain how important those things are but ruining their lives is n't what the justice system is about , i 'd rather have them be productive members of society in a year than having them spend twice what they lived up until now doing community service . 
   i 'm not talking about military confrontation once she 's the president , but rather a tit for tat information leak of some sort . 
  well , i 'm looking forward to this leak slugfest then , 
   if hillary gets elected , russians will regret doing this . 
  she might throw a tantrum to show her voters she can butt heads with russia and is a strong leader but did n't she [ accept money from russia in a shady deal recently ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0 ) ? 
   beyond mines in kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world , the sale gave the russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the united states . 
  since uranium is considered a strategic asset , with implications for national security , the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of united states government agencies . 
  among the agencies that eventually signed off was the state department , then headed by mr. clinton 's wife , hillary rodham clinton . 
   as the russians gradually assumed control of uranium one in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013 , canadian records show , a flow of cash made its way to the clinton foundation . 
  uranium one 's chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $ 2.35 million . 
  those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the clintons , despite an agreement mrs. clinton had struck with the obama white house to publicly identify all donors . 
  other people with ties to the company made donations as well . 
   and shortly after the russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in uranium one , mr. clinton received $ 500,000 for a moscow speech from a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin that was promoting uranium one stock . 
  if she ca n't be blackmailed or prevented from becoming president by publishing those emails , she can certainly be bought later down the road . 
  cheers , i 'm bookmarking this , i 'll read it after a good night 's sleep , 
  i like the idea of a common currency but seems weird all countries would share a common currency while having a different tax code , different wages and labour costs , different budget policies , different needs ( some want a strong currency , some a weaker one ) , different priorities ( budget deficit vs investment ) , etc. 
  i guess their idea was that once we all adopted the same currency , we would naturally ... change ? 
  become similar economies ? 
  i do n't know , euro sounds like something we should have adopted at the very end , once the european union became some sort of federal government , not at a times where calling it an `` union '' is actually pretty generous . 
  same way the `` treaty of versailles '' ended ww1 and brought us peace !, 
  but hey , people who jump to violence to get what they want are rarely the ones wishing for peace . 
  it 's hard to imagine yesterday 's neighbours killing each other overnight without really understanding what 's going on , i did n't really understand it at school but the movie [ `` la reine margot '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110963/ ) is a good depiction of it . 
  well , good ... maybe not , it 's a good adjani movie but there are a lot of unecessary sex scenes , still , the frenzy of the massacre itself is well-done , made me a bit sick , it 's like everybody is ready to kill each other but once the deed is done , nobody really understands what they 've done or why they did it , that 's a tough hangover . 
  well , i 'm sure you want to live in peace and be # 1 but be happy , at least you 're not ... somalia ? 
  setting the bar really high these days !, 
  not sure how it was worse then . 
  the biggest attack on france soil in the 20th century killed 28 people ( and the second biggest killed 8 ) but in 1 year , we had charlie hebdo ( 20 deaths ) , bataclan + ( 130 deaths ) and nice ( 84 deaths ) plus god knows how many injured , traumatized and grieving people . 
  plus in 2012 we had one which ended up with 7 deaths including 3 schoolchildren , 1 more and the # 1 # 2 # 4 and # 5 biggest attacks would have been in the 2010s , there 's definitely no slowing down the isis death train . 
  you 're right , we went from troubled times to relatively peaceful times , the fact that we went back to an awful terrorism-plagued era says a lot about the decisions of our leaders , just because it 's not new does n't mean it 's okay . 
  daesh called for all muslims to kill french people whenever they could with whatever they have at hand , they do n't have to sign up for anything to contribute to the awful thing they call a cause . 
  yeah france and germany are the most recent examples of that in western europe , how many times did we go at war for alsace-lorraine ? 
  i 'm sure 90 % of the casualties during these wars did n't even know that region . 
  yeah , i hope we wo n't see another [ saint-barth\u00e9lemy massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._bartholomew%27s_day_massacre ) but i suppose it 's one way to end tensions between two groups  . , 
  do n't forget lone wolf !, 
  see , it 's not a group a crazy people , it 's just multiple crazy people acting as a group , phew , nothing to be worried about !, 
  yeah we use either daesh or ei ( etat islamique ) but i suppose we ca n't have our officials saying `` etat '' ( state ) when talking about a terrorist group who is n't a state , even if daesh means exactly that in another language . 
  yeah a wannabe one would be masturbating in front of his computer thinking about it but never actually do something . 
  when you take a weapon and slit someone 's throat , you 're no wannabe-anything . 
   police detained the man and found remains of explosive substances on his hands and clothes ( c4 and penthrite [ petn ] ) [ ... ]  they did n't find explosives in his flates that 's somewhat worrying , i 'm glad they caught him but if he had rented multiple flats and made explosives the police ca n't find , would n't it make sense that he had accomplices ? 
  lol our troops could n't even return fire if attacked or provide support to policemen who were fighting terrorists before the bataclan attacks , they had to wait for a letter from the prefect and were forced to watch on the sidelines before that it 's only after a report pointed out that anti-terrorism patrols who could n't do anything in case of a terrorist attacks were maybe somewhat useless that it has changed you seriously overestimate how much planning goes into these things , the patrols are there so people feel safe-ish , they 're mostly useless . 
   salbey : yes , i saw his gun and in which direction he was pointing it and thought to myself : ` well now it 's getting dangerous ' well , he 's not wrong about * that * . 
  and what about the rest of us who wish not to be chopped to bits by a criminal in our own country ? 
  seems weird that we go to great lengths to protect people who proved they had no intention to integrate and respect the law even if it means putting our own citizens in danger . 
  it should be some sort of contract : we 're doing you a huge favour by letting you in ( true , we can barely feed and provide accomodation to our own poors ) , if you 're willing to integrate then we 'll do our best to integrate you , if you 're not happy , leave , if you even think of starting trouble , out . 
  wonder what they were thinking on that one , protecting someone from a corrupt dictator who invents imaginary charges against a political opponent to get him back is one thing but crimes committed in the very country that saved you ? 
  yeah / u/schurkjeboefje is right , it happened in france . 
  some morrocon migrant who was in holidays in france ( but also lived there ) went full retard , stabbed a mother and three of her daughters because the husband scratched his inner tight in presence of his wife and he had to avenge her honour or some bullshit . 
  but it 's alright because he was crazy `` crazy '' and not your usual `` terrorist '' lunatic so we should all feel safe . 
  you can support helping the refugees with food / money / water and building camps for them in safe zones without letting any of them in europe . 
  when you bring a million of them in with 0 background check , while letting them go wherever they want ** knowing ** that some of them come from a highly religious / highly conservative background that approves of honor killings , violence , terrorist attacks , pedophilia and treating women like cattles and ** knowing ** that some of them are terrorists ( c'mon , you 're at war , thousands of people coming from isis-controlled regions flee the region and go to the europe , you ca n't open the door and expect terrorists to stay outside like good children when they 've actually told you their plans to infiltrate the mass of refugees to send fighters back in europe ) . 
  if you 're pro-asylum , you 're not supporting terrorism , you 're just accepting that there 'll be terrorism and that life will be worse for many germans but the safety of germans matters less than the wants of refugees . 
  merkel put outsiders above her own population , does n't mean she does n't care about her own population nor is bad for wanting to help refugees but there were safer / cheaper ways to do it and she prioritized catering to refugees over the safety of her population . 
   first of all , the claims that french officials made about how the attacker was `` very rapidly radicalized '' now appear at least a bit questionable . 
  as usual , every investigation into a terrorist attack starts with `` nothing could have been done to prevent it '' , `` it was too sudden there was just nothing we could have done about it '' and `` our security services did nothing wrong '' because that 's the quickest way to appease an upset population . 
  few days later , sometimes a few weeks/months later , little by little we learn that lack of fundings , lack of cooperation between different services or organizations , lack of personnel , too much leniency towards well-known violent and radicalized individuals , stupid mistakes , lack of preparation or sheer incompetence cost people their lives . 
  but by the time we learn about it , some people moved on , others are resigned because they know nothing will come out of it and the government promises something vague like `` changes '' and `` improvements '' , rinse and repeat after every attack . 
  the way they protected the entrance to the promenade is stupid , basically putting one car there to block the entrance means you are aware that there is danger if a vehicle goes through but what 's the point if you can just go around it ? 
  the only thing they were protected against is some old man who did n't pay attention to `` road blocked '' signs beforehand and would start driving 10s before realizing there are people there and he would stop right there , whether there 's a car or not . 
  is he even 17 ? 
  looks like he 's at least 2x17 years old to me . 
  i thought the 2002 election would be a wake-up call for france , jmlp reached the second turn of presidential elections , the left got destroyed , but since chirac won by a wide margin in the second round ( people got really afraid of the consequences of having jmlp as president , even he was n't prepared for governing ) , they decided to ignore it . 
  then they kept climbing , elections after elections and everytime they tell us `` we understood your worries '' , `` we know why you voted for the fn '' , `` we heard your message '' then they go on and ignore it entirely until the following elections . 
  sure there 's still somewhat of a glass ceiling ( ps/lr voters will rather vote for one another than for the fn ) but it wo n't be there forever if they do n't reforms . 
  first , let 's refuse to acknowledge the problem while it only affects a few people ( foreigners living in ghetto are geographically the first people subjected to daily violence from gangs and thugs ) then pretend anyone who wishes to discuss the problem once it becomes well-known is `` racist '' . 
  then mock far-right politicians when they actually acknowledge that these are issues worth discussing even if the solutions they offer are often ridiculous or some of their supporters are hateful people , oh and call every citizen who ever cast their vote for the far-right an idiot , that 'll surely win them back . 
  once everything spirals out of control , tell people to deal with it and tell them that you 're doing an amazing job and nothing could have ever prevented that , that it 's all new and we have to adapt . 
  oh and continue to tell far-right supporters that they 're morons . 
  a true recipe for success , i do not wish for the fn to be in power for many reasons because some of their ideas are silly if not dangerous but by god do the other mainstream parties do their best to push people towards the fn , they could n't do worse if they tried to sabotage themselves intentionally . 
  you know you live in a weird era when you 're relieved this is a `` normal '' murder and not the kind you do n't like hearing about it . 
  there are different s-levels though , some have a s file for having their name come up during an investigation on someone else even if they 're just barely acquantainaces but is n't it obvious that someone who has both a s-file and is `` ultra-well-known '' by police forces is more suspicous that some pro-vegan activist who got arrested once for throwing a carrot at a crs . 
  does n't help that our prime minister is burying his head in the sand , saying people who boo'ed him and called him a murderer were not actually upset / grieving / angry random people but fn supporters who were asked to boo him . 
  which is a polite way to say their opinion can be entirely ignored because fn are n't real people and nobody shares the mindset of these few people but if i look around me , the mindset that the government is ready to sacrifice our safety for cookie points and easy votes is pretty common , it 's easy to say that we just have to `` learn to live with terrorism '' when you 're surrounded by bodyguards 24/7 . 
   while it 's true that they will take credit for literally anything , the fact that they are inspiring these ` lone wolves ' as the american security agencies like to call them is just as problematic . 
  we 're really helping them , are n't we ? 
  we allow them to publish their propaganda on our social media , we allow them to recruit our own people and turn them against us or ask them to join the fight in syria , we even remind people every now and then that isis calls for all muslims to kill people wherever they can with whatever they have , we have experts telling us isis has pr experts and why it 's working yet we continue to do exactly as expected from us , etc.
