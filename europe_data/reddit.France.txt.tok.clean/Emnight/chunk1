thank you for your input , humour master . 
  i could have sworn you were german for a minute . 
  you are very intelligent . 
  i 'm an atheist but still , religion helps a lot of people to go through their lives so why not . 
  religion or not , people will eventually find a way to oppress one another ( ideologies , tribes , political parties , nations , etc. 
  ) , it 's in our nature . 
  [ meanwhile in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._bartholomew's_day_massacre ) ... of course it 's not ideal but still far better religious tolerance than most countries around that time period .

  [ neither does `` normal '' islam . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-andalus#non-muslims_under_the_caliphate ) [ time and again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_empire#christianity_and_judaism ) non-muslims have been living under islamic rule and had their right to worship something else protected . 
  jewish or christian often rose to prominent positions of power under the ottoman empire . 
  i do n't think it 's relevant to bring up the original islamic conquest in 2015 but whatever fits this guy 's personal agenda . 
  the thing is you try to apply modern logic ( with a strong personal bias ) to history , which is something that never ever produced any interesting deductions . 
  also you seem to believe islam is monolithic ( it 's not ) , inherently evil because it spread through conquest half a millenium ago ( do i need to remind you how did christianity spread among african populations ? ) .

  as i said `` good relativism '' . 
  unfortunately it does n't amount to anything at all .

  france made a lot of money from the greek debt and we 're extremely hypocritical about it .

  nice . 
  is there a significant difference between western turks and greeks , ethnically ?

  that 's what 's happening in france . 
  slowly sabotaging education and healthcare with budget cuts over the last two decades . 
   so we have now established that the bmi value is pointless and illogical . 
  you 're being obtuse and i wo n't waste any more keystrokes arguing with you . 
  jesus christ you are dense . 
   a person with a large bmi value is obese . 
  no one said that . 
  what is said is that people with a high bmi weight more compared to their weight than others , which can be attributed to either bodyfat or muscle or a combination of both . 
  % age of bodyfat is a much more important value but it is harder to measure , thus bmi is a fine tool to help people who are n't weightlifting/edge cases to know whether their weight is considered normal . 
   so according to your `` math '' , if a body with the base 1 and the height 1 , gets a height increase of 1 , now being 2 , the weight is now according to your `` math '' , 4 times higher than it was before ? 
  no one said it was y = x \u00b2 . 
  i said y = k.x \u00b2 with k being any number , potentially something like 0.05, 
  i have graduated and am now studying mathematics and logic at the university , thank you for your concern . 
  weight increases with squared height in most organisms , which is why the height is squared . 
  no one said bmi is perfect , but unless you are using it on edge cases such as bodybuilders , it 's a valid tool to get a quick idea .
