  in germany since most of the muslim population is turkish , it should be easier to set up i hope . 
  this was at least empirically observed by a world bank economist ( one year before piketty 's capital ) . 
  look up ` elephant chart ' . 
  and there 's no controversy about that data . 
  the problem is not old people at work , it 's them hogging the power roles and being paid more at 60 than the 40 years old that is actually twice as productive as them . 
  new breed ? 
  there might be a large intersection between the two groups  denying science is find of a full-time job for some . 
  public health and sanitation is totally in the jurisdiction of the state though . 
  in france some vaccines are mandatory , and ( almost ) nobody claims it infringes on personal freedom . 
  i 'm aware that some other countries have a very different opinion about the role of the state , but still ... 
  well look on the other side of the atlantic , the measles outbreak was in fucking anaheim , 
  our local one will have his license revoked on the 1st of december  http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2016/07/09/vaccination-henri-joyeux-radie-par-l-ordre-des-medecins_4966962_3224.html it 's maddening that this wakefield fraudster still yield that much influence . 
  really sad . 
  and therefore french people are the problem , not your perception of a foreign cultural object ? 
  fyi most of the walk-on actors in rabbi jacob are actually jewish , and it was shot in the marais with the support of the community . 
  you might find the benny hill-like humor unfunny , but do n't prance around shouting racism about something that actually lampoons racism . 
  analogies are very limited in the domain , i agree . 
  i just wanted to point out that while there 's a consensus about the fact that ideas do not trigger revolutions , they might still play a great role in their aftermath . 
  the same way marx is n't the root cause of the russian civil war ( he thought the revolution would take place in germany ) . 
  yet you can not deny what they got afterwards was mostly influenced by him . 
  when you 're an atheist , listening for 5 min about your imaginary friend is already `` too much '' , 
  i know , sorry about that ... part of it is emotional response for the feeling of rejection , part of it a genuine conviction that uncertainty is bad for everybody , i 'd say . 
  and what incentive does dragging your feet create for the rest of europe to give you a good deal ? 
  do n't you remember we never wanted you out in the first place ? 
  yes that same one . 
  we got our local climate change denier ( well , he denies the human factor , like sarkozy ) , but frankly , he 's much , much less influent than a decade ago : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/claude_all%c3%a8gre surprise surprise , sarkozy wanted him as a minister , but a smear campaign from the ecologists about his climate position costed him the job . 
  so yeah , the dabate here is far less toxic than on your side of the atlantic i guess . 
  i was very surprised at sarkozy 's comment , because this position will not win him any votes in france . 
  he was probably courting some specific lobby . 
  macron is not from this lr party ( mainstream right-wing dudes ) . 
  in fact he 's not a member of any party and says he does n't `` fit in '' . 
  yeah , and that 's gon na last as long as there is 10 % unemployment . 
  where have you been the last 30 years ? 
  do n't you realize what the most pressing `` actual issue '' is ? 
  as much has i agree with you , that would be ignoring thousands of years of human history . 
  funeral rites are as old as humanity . 
  why do n't we ban burial in place of the much more practical incineration ? 
  because some of the living would rather not , and grieving is an essential need . 
  i think that 's the core reason why people ensure the will of the deceased are respected . 
  if you feel harvest is a desecration of the remains , there 's not much of a rational point that can be made to make you think otherwise . 
  no , the big issue of opt-in vs. opt-out is people that do not care vs. lives that could be saved . 
  we do n't need everybody 's organs , there are enough people on earth that are convinced a corpse is just a corpse . 
  dead , you cease to be a people , and you do not own ` stuff ' . 
  material possession are different , because they can be transferred to your family , but ( at least legally in france ) your family does not own your organs/body once you passed . 
  your analogy does n't stand . 
  slate has an interesting article resuming the situation in france : http://www.slate.fr/story/123257/france-anti-vaccins ( french ) basically like in the us with the alleged autism cases , a vaccine against hepatitis believed to be linked to sclerosis has been recalled in 1998 by applying the precautionary principle to extreme ( which was ultimately proven unnecessary ) . 
  this planted the seeds for the current defiance against vaccine . 
  as mentioned by many , children vaccination is mandatory in france , even if some wacos try to cheat their way out of it . 
  it 's was n't on the island that host the cathedral , but close to the banks on the other side of the river . 
  it 's also a popular tourist district though . 
  not sure about ` plenty ' , those ones were well known because of their friendship with another french terrorist ( the one doing the antisemitic attack coordinated with the charlie massacre ) . 
  well the k\u00f6nigsberg name is gon na live long , because a lot of people are studying graph theory nowadays : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_bridges_of_k%c3%b6nigsberg, 
  took me 5 minutes to find a link between the journalist responsible for this piece and the ccif . 
  https://twitter.com/liliagaida/status/765888958379204608 given what we know about the ccif , the content of the article is not very surprising anymore ... https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4y4ml7/canardencha%c3%aen%c3%a9_des_islamistes_qui_avancent_mosqu%c3%a9e/, 
  we would n't care about muslims if it was n't for political islam . 
  that 's the big difference , mexicans are not pushing for importing customary laws into the us ... 
  are n't you aware that would le pen become our president , there would n't be any eu to begin with ? 
  i could n't sustain a conversation about dordogne . 
  and i 'm born and bred in france . 
  me packing my stuff and leaving town ... 
  in france there 's this stupid tax on storage for the music industry that explain higher prices on most electronic devices ... [ redevance sur la copie privee ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/copie_priv%c3%a9e#redevance_sur_la_copie_priv.c3.a9e ), 
  you do n't even have to go all the way and block all ads , they are nice enough to provide you with the least invasive procedure to get rid of them  [ no more criteo ] ( http://www.criteo.com/deactivate-criteo-banners/ ), 
  b2b . 
  you know the pair of sneakers than you glanced upon two weeks ago that keeps popping up whereever you go on the net ? 
  it 's them . 
  er , i only intervened to point out the existence of hate speech laws . 
  i was not at the source of the discussion , and i 'm not sure why everyone seems so stressed out right now and why the discussion is so heated . 
  i 'm not here to be right or wrong . 
  all i said was `` look , you can actually end up in prison for expressing some racist opinions , even though obviously you 'll have to get really hardcore for it to happen '' ( for info the guy i was mentioning is a serial , unapologetic offender ) . 
  chill , it 's the week-end , 
  much anger i sense in you . 
  ok so yes thoughtcrime is not a thing in civilised countries , only expressions of racism will get you in jail . 
  i thought that was obvious . 
  [ quite a lot of them actually ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech ) in france alone , a quite notorious white supremacist has just been sentenced to 3 months in prison for publishing a drawing disputing the holocaust ( [ link in french ] ( http://www.streetpress.com/sujet/1489508577-soral-condamne-prison-ferme ) ), 
  you do realize that i 'm french too ? 
  and i 'm also from the south of france and living in paris , meaning i can tell the difference of behavior between the municipalities from the south and from the north . 
  if you think there are no major corruption problem in marseilles and in paca in general you must be wearing a blindfold . 
  http://www.respectmag.com/25762-transparency-france-collaboratif-corruption it 's good to be a patriot , but we have to admit our own shortcomings . 
  for a very advanced economy we could do better to fend off corruption : http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016, 
  i think public funds embezzlement is a very latin disease indeed yeah so no we 're not in a position to give lessons  ( and i was actually being critical of the size and style , not really the cost - the parliament house is notorious as one of the ugliest building in the world ... ), 
  really weird from france to witness to power the church has in your country . 
  naively , we usually think you 'd be as atheist as the czech with such a dose of communism . 
  one could have thought the romanians might have learned something from the palatul parlamentului , and yet ... well , another reason not to go to bucaresti i guess . 
  transylvania was already much more interesting anyway :p, 
  for example ? 
  no , maybe i 'm a hopeless atlantist and optimist , but i think they are resisting fiercely on the other side of the pond . 
  the thing i 'm the most worried about is the orientation of the supreme court . 
  if ruth ginsburg passes away , this could become really ugly . 
  he sure talks the talk . 
  ca n't walk the walk though , the us got strong checks and balances . 
  well i heard our concrete jungle too can be quite hostile indeed , 
   climate is also good ahaha french guiana is hell on earth  the amazonian forest is an extremely hostile environment . 
  where do you think we send our special forces and foot soldiers to harden them ? 
   king of playing the victim tactics who is n't nowadays ... : /, 
  er , it 's actually the opposite . 
  taking a federalist-like stance is guaranteed to be a big no-no with le pen voters ( and most of them would n't know who erdogan is anyway ) . 
  * heaven * is actually the word we use in france ( paradis fiscal ) , 
  it 's a word in a poem by friedrich schiller , that you might know better under the form of the european union official anthem , 
  oh reporting facts is campaigning against crooks now ?
