  i did n't know that was supposed to be stored in a fridge . 
  i thought it was kind of alive . 
  also , i did n't know you needed fridges at all in eesti ( maybe i should leave the mediterranean shores sometimes ... ), 
  michel clerc has claimed it . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_clerc_ ( arch % c3 % a9ologue ) if it was true , it was n't a real big settlement i guess , or it was n't on the exact same site ... 
  is importing this insult to food in the rest of the eu legal ? 
  some even say the phoenicians were occupying the site before the phoceans arrived . 
  for what , 10 years ? 
   i laugh , but the corsican republic was the birthplace of many progressive innovations , and some of the us founding fathers being familiar with the corsican constitution , it was an influence on the us constitution itself . 
  sure , it 's just that some people could think it was pure provocation , without any message . 
  when there 's an outrage around charlie it 's mostly non-french people complaining , and the message is often lost . 
  also , being pro-choice today in europe is not really a statement , except maybe in fiercely catholic countries ( and i 'm not even sure , i do n't know eg . 
  poland well ) . 
  in the early seventies , it was political . 
  to put that in context , the news at the time was that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifesto_of_the_343 so famous women came forward and admitted having illegal abortion , to show the hypocrisy of the situation . 
  a few years after that , abortion was legalised . 
  so the idea here was to target the church because of its position on the matter , while making a gross and blasphemous joke , which is what these people are famous for . 
  it 's actually a pro-choice cover , 
  i read it exactly that way too . 
  it 's a dark pessimistic jab at those #fuckyou 2016 feelings . 
  it depends , will brazil be willing to lend the fn some bucks ? 
  that 's why he has to run outside a party platform ... 
  some regions in france have a special status too . 
  not necessary the most obvious ones  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/local_law_in_alsace-moselle, 
  just do n't dump them in the seine , i plan to bath there in a few years . 
  emir kusturica is very popular in france thanks to his exposition through the cannes festival . 
   the far left has lost the popular support you do n't live in france or italy do you ? 
  well if only these dickheads were at least targeting diesel vehicules ... ( outraged parisian ), 
  `` when holland sending their people , they do not send the best ones '' -- everyone from southern france during summer, 
  israel has been probably the most divisive issue for the french left ( probably the world left as well ) for decades , indeed . 
  it 's got a musical side too , but it 's a 18th century thing . 
  it 's basically the seeds of romanticism . 
  applying it to mahler is clearly an anachronism at best . 
  happy now ? 
  well , it 's qualified as `` anar '' in france , but they probably are not really anarchists nowadays indeed . 
  they clearly used to be in the seventies/early eighties . 
  you 're right about the universalism too . 
  it 's deeply embedded into the french psyche . 
  but here we would n't consider ridiculing your religion an intrusive practice . 
  i guess that 's part of the universalist package , 
  spend more time on the internets . 
  georges soros is the centerpiece of all the wild conspiracy theories out there , the ones from the alt-right and the ones from the far left , 
  yes , it 's a french thing , called `` humour noir '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_comedy that said , even in france it 's not for everybody . 
  charlie hebdo is totally an acquired taste . 
  these cartoonists have been around since the sixties , and they still practice no holds barred free speech as it was customary in the early seventies . 
  it 's an openly libertarian ( the french brand of libertarians are left-wing anarchists , not the same as in the us ) publication . 
  clearly a fringe magazine . 
  the article is quite poor indeed ( well , let 's say it 's factual but with very few context ) . 
  and you made the effort of reading it for sure . 
  it being a french affair mot of the links i could give you would be in french . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kucj8/french_woman_who_killed_husband_freed_after/dbr3ney/ ) though is a traduction of a blog post from the most famous french law blogger , maitre eolas . 
  he is a trusted source on the subject on the french-language internet . 
  now , i was n't present on the crime scene , so i 'll avoid howling with the wolves . 
  please be aware though that this affair became highly political after feminist organizations chose it as a standard bearer against violence against women ( a noble and consensual cause if any ) , so always double-check what everyone will say on the subject . 
  people are pushing agendas , the president included ( frankly given his approval ratings and the media agitation he really did n't have much of a choice ) , and a lot of them do n't really care about the protagonists themselves . 
  somehow two separate juries did n't buy that story though . 
  do you suggest they did n't have the time to read the newspapers too ? 
  any snarky comments about the justice system maybe ? 
  i 'm gon na repeat myself , yes i understand your point of view , in a modern context everything from a few centuries back will look chocking to us . 
  but i 'm afraid this kind of reasoning , judging everything with a 21-century progressive framework , is a way to not understand the men from that time and have a hard time learning anything from their mistakes . 
  edit : this discussion has drifted toward a philosophical debate that is completely out of topic , and i 'm at work , so i 'm not gon na pursue it , but if like me you 're interested in the subject , here 's a bbc magazine article about it : http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23772194 it 's not taking side , i 'm not trying to push an agenda here , 
  i do n't think you can claim there are racist undertones in millenia-old legends . 
  the world was very different at the time , by that account every author from before the 19 century was a racist-misoginist-antisemitic pig . 
  do we claim mozart was islamophobic because die entf\u00fchrung aus dem serail pokes fun at the ottomans ? 
   it is a mistake to assume that despising the nazis is mutually exclusive from being a racist . 
  agreed , but have a look at the link . 
  he explicitly takes a jab at the racist theories en vogue at his time , by going back to the original definition of the aryan race , and expressing regrets at not having the privilege of being jewish . 
  to conclude , i see what you mean , you can read it like that today , but that would n't have been interpreted that way at the time it was written  edit : an amusing thought : there was the same debate with wagner for quite some time , because hitler made the same racist reading as you ( although not with the same intent of course !, 
  ) , and the two , lord of the ring and wagner 's ring , are based on the same legend . 
  wagner did n't have in mind that racist undertones hilter saw ( to be fair he was fairly antisemitic , but he did n't intentionally make antisemitic operas ) , yet it gave him a bad rap for decades ... 
  well given everything you cite is actually borrowed material from the north-european folklore ( [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nibelungenlied ) mostly ) , it 's hard to call racism on tolkien frankly . 
  also , he despised the nazis , that tried to capitalise on his german ancestry : http://www.openculture.com/2014/04/j-r-r-tolkien-snubs-a-german-publisher.html, 
  that was n't him , that was newt gingrinch . 
  so what ? 
  did you know that labeling is a classical [ propaganda technique ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_techniques ) too , like disinformation ? 
  does n't that make you a propagandist yourself ? 
  use the absolute numbers , not just the rate . 
  estonia weights peanuts in the grand scheme of things . 
  their dirty 700 mwh is not much compared to the coal burned by germany and poland for 9 gwh each . 
  ah but this is a longstanding tradition mon ami . 
  [ popular folk singer praising the greatness of our nation ( in french ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmb6w5jhdum ), 
  article 7 of the treaty on european union . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012m007 ( not gon na work though ), 
  there are no shit tabloid in france . 
  the closest thing we have is some gossip magazines , but they never do politics except when the president gets caught with a new girlfriend and from that angle only . 
  for now at least ... 
  the eu and nato have the pkk listed as a terrorist organization . 
  it 's china and russia that denie it . 
  newspapers are not state-controlled in europe , they can print whatever they want . 
  they do n't represent any official point of view . 
   nice conspiracy theory . 
  what conspiracy theory ? 
  nobody denies the guy died from a terminal illness . 
  the question of who was behind the murder remains open , the french prosecution pushing the mit hypothesis after having examined the grey wolf one and estimating it unlikely . 
  only sure thing , now we 'll never know . 
  i suppose you misunderstood the title of the article . 
  we ... just do n't know why exactly . 
  it 's spontaneous actually . 
  i only found french resources unfortunately , such as this one : http://www.institut-paul-ricard.org/img/pdf/rapport_2010_observatoire_taxrac.pdf basically there are several competing hypothesis , and the only sure thing is that water temperature seems to be a factor , since the regression mostly occurs during the cold season ( water was colder during winter this last decade in the north mediterranean ) . 
  we were thinking the exact same thing in france in the thirties you know .
