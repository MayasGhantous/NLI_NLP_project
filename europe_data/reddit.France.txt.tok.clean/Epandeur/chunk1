i know it 's sad , but i immediatly though to the consequences for the brexit . 
  clearly , the eu is attacked . 
  what the brits think ? 
  will it reinforce the : `` yes '' -  `` eu is dangerous , too much immigrants and open boarders '' or `` no '' -  `` we 're with the eu in this fight and will not abandon our allies now '', 
  pretty sure that all french commentators pronounce the ` ch ' . 
  no , italian/english , as the french one which is in french/english . 
  sincerely , i do n't know if i do n't prefer plain english instead of this hybrid shit , it reminds me k-pop crap with korean and english chorus for retarded . 
  i will vote for austria , bosnia , macedonia . 
  i really do n't understand what 's the point of eurovision if we sing with the same language . 
  not particularly clever but i ca n't see where it 's a trump-ism . 
  it 's still less extreme than obama or any other us president with guantanamo . 
  everybody hope you leave  . 
  english is little more than french badly pronounced ( g. cl\u00e9menceau quote : `` l'anglais ? 
   people : scandinavian there are blond peope in france . 
   buildings : germanic there are germanic buildings in france ( alsace ) . 
   background : swiss alp alps are also in france ( actually , the most beautiful and highest peak is in france ) . 
   food : southern ( spanish or italian . . and maybe french ) typical mediterranean food is extremely popular in the south of france . 
   government : united kingdom with queen kings and all that deal the biggest royal domain of the world is in france ( versailles ) . 
  you perfectly described france :d !, 
   also britain went through a phase where it encouraged encorporation of other cultures ( nicking the best bits ) whereas france 's colonial attitude , right until the end , was to convert the colonials into french people completely . 
  britain were like `` we are so amazing it does n't really matter so long as people do what they are told when we want them to '' and the french were like `` we are so amazing everyone should be exactly like us '' so it 's not surprising that a french person ca n't see a way of encorporating another culture 's food into their own culture ( even when they like the other culture 's food ) . 
  you 're probably right but i think that the problem is also that we have too much diversity in our own culture 's food to add more stuff to that . 
  the regional diversity is crazy with a lot of influences and constrasts from our culturally very rich neighbours ( we have nearly the same gastronomy than italia in the southern france with tomatoes and olive oil everywhere , but also a butter everywhere gastronomy in bretagne , a bit of germany in alsace , a part of the spanish gastronomy with pays basque ... ) + all the overseas territories that are legitimely considered as part of the french culinary heritage ( by example chicken colombo and cayenne 's chili from french guyana ) . 
  some people that are born in french algeria also consider couscous or tajine as french food , but this is much more debatable because algeria is no longer french . 
  all in all , there is so much things to consider as french food that we have difficulties to add all the influences from ex-colonies , and there are clearly things that were clearly created by french or franco-vietnamese in the vietnamese gastronomy : http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/b-nh-to-baguettes-french-influences-on-vietnamese-cuisine/ the use of baguette , beef and typical european vegetables is for me french influence on viet gastronomy ( and not french gastronomy ) , and it 's the same thing for tikka masala , it 's just british influence on indian/paki gastronomy . 
  i could ` nt agree more , you really understood perfectly the key differences between the two countries , pragmatism vs idealism , i note this . 
  have to admit that this is one of the best polandball comic . 
  yes , and nearly all `` chinese restaurant '' in france are owned by vietnamese that adapted some of their traditional recipe to the palate of french ( can confirm , i lived with a french vietnamese and they definitely have two versions of the same recipe , the restaurant for french adapted to french and their own version for their home , and they 're completely different ) . 
  i would definitely not integrate vietnamese food in the french gastronomy though . 
  well when you have to cite a indian recipe as an example of good british meal , there 's definitely a problem  . 
   population , size , army , economy , cultural power , empire , geographical proximity , cuisine , ... ok for everything but ... 
  if you finally admit that the official language of europe is french and let the english be the language of the usa , it 's ok  . 
  the viking invasions were in 790 . 
  the normandy begin to exist more than one century after , in 911 , and the duke of normandy was clearly a vassal of the king of france . 
  you ca n't seriously consider that all the duchies of france were not france , this is a nonsense . 
  the conquest of england is again one century later , and there was nothing `` viking '' in norman culture : same language than france , vassal of the king of france , same religion than france ( christianism ) , more than 2 centuries of genetic mixing with french ( and viking did n't replace the whole population in the first place , as the normans did n't replace all the people of britanny with the invasion of william ) . 
  you can believe what you want , but it was pretty clear that normandy was a duchy of france , a duchy that became very powerful with the conquest of england and began to be a rival after this event . 
  this is clear if you read wikipedia about what is considered as the kingdom of france : `` the division of france between the angevin ( plantagenet ) kings of england and the capetian kings of france would lead to the hundred years ' war '' . 
  sorry , but every historian knows that the hundred years ' war was actually a war between two french families and that the notion of england as a country began to appear only after this war and its resolution . 
  england was really french , with all the nobility speaking exactly the same french than france ( the language and culture was actually even closer that what you could find in county of toulouse and the rest of southern france with `` lenga d'oc '' ) . 
  so fucking boring . 
  sing in romanian for fuck sake . 
  both . 
  i like the clear syllables and the flat tone . 
  it 's one of the few language where i can distinguish the words and can repeat a sentence . 
   i really think that turkish is a lovely language but nevertheless its an irrelevant language due to no colonies there are no irrelevant languages , nothing is more relevant than diversity . 
  japanese . 
  i also like french accent on any non-french language , specially for girls . 
  russian is also so sexy . 
  i particularly dislike american english for girls , it sounds so vulgar and not feminine at all ( uk english is ok ) . 
   this is common knowledge , they are never referred to as french , but instead , normans normands is also the name of present french people living in normandie , the actual region of france today . 
  you should try opening an atlas sometimes . 
  well , you just said that people from british origin in america are not british but american . 
  so yo could agree with the fact that people from viking origin in france are not viking , but french . 
  be consistent . 
   william the ** conqueror ** , who was not ** french ** , but ** norman ** , who were ** originally ** norsemen hence the ** name ** norman . 
  normandy was not ** part ** of france , and neither was william the ** conqueror ** the king of france at the ** time ** . 
  hilighted words from french origin . 
  but yeah , if you want , he was not french , just a normand living in france and speaking french . 
  i really like the stereotype that french are always on strike . 
  this is our french revolution heritage , a deep rebel nature , a warning for the dominants that you ca n't abuse of french because they will be culturally the first to react strongly . 
   i see the neo-napoleons do n't tell them our plan please ... 
  germany is the economic leader of the eu , france the political and military leader . 
  great couple . 
   also as of 2016 the french military is weaker than the british ( i assume you are implying the opposite from your comment about an aircraft carrier ) . 
  here is the source . 
  uk is number 5 and france is number 6 ( scroll down slightly and look to the right for the top 10 list ) . 
  the nuclear power is not taken into account in this ranking ( and seriously , ultimately , this is the most important thing ) . 
  and sorry , but france is better than uk for this : http://www.worldblaze.in/top-10-nuclear-power-countries-in-the-world/2/ . 
   not to mention the uk has a close network of powerful political allies around the world please , do n't be ridiculous . 
  france is the country the most spread around the world : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_time_zones_by_country . 
  also , the biggest maritime territory of the world : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone#france from a geostrategic point of view , uk is a dwark compared to this , france does n't need `` political allies around the world '' , france is around the world . 
  sorry for you that you did n't manage to keep your empire , but the common wealth club is pretty ridiculous compared to have the only remaining country on which the sun never set . 
  welcome to 2016 . 
   but the vietnamese choosing to speak english over french has benefits of its own , like being to communicate with trade partners more easily . 
  true . 
  never said that it was a nonsense switch . 
   moving away from english to french or german has no such benefits . 
  false . 
  nigeria is surrounded by francophone country ( they have other languages , but the common lingua franca of western africa is de facto french ) and is moving more and more toward french to not be completely isolated . 
  they recently joined the iof ( international organisation of francophonie , http://www.channelstv.com/2012/12/12/nigeria-to-join-organisation-of-french-speaking-countries/ ) and promoted french as the 2nd national language ( http://www.antimoon.com/forum/t15459.htm ) . 
   their lack of knowledge on the eu is hardly the uk 's fault . 
  never said that it 's the uk 's fault . 
  i just said that if brexit happen , people would ` nt care and nothing will change . 
  i said slightly . 
  for my wife , it 's not slightly , because she 's a french with vietnamese descent ( keep in mind that there is a large vietnamese community in france ) , she only speaks french perfectly ( she can speak viet and english , but badly ) and can not communicate perfectly with a part of her family . 
  they 're from the same family , but like strangers . 
  i feel the same with the arabisation of algeria ( have algeria ancestry ) , i do n't speak a single word of arab , but hopefully algeria still speak a lot french . 
  i would be really sad if they switch to english . 
  imagine a american of irish ancestry with english being more and more replaced by chinese or german . 
  how do you think he will feel ? 
  well vietnam is not anymore part of france , but the fact that they switch from french to english as a second language annoy me ( slightly ) . 
  would be ok for any other language , but not english ( this old rivalry ... ) . 
  the whole continent united and speaking french ( will not happen ) would be the dream of napoleon , can you imagine how butthurt the brits would be ? 
  no he 's completely right . 
  in france , some people are surprised by the brexit , because most people did n't even know that the uk were in the eu . 
  the cameron drama is so ridiculous , threating a brexit while it 's not obvious for the rest of the world that you 're in eu in the first place ... 
  believe me , in france , we sometimes blame germany for eu decisions , but uk , lol , why blaming you ? 
  you clearly overestimate the attention that the continentals give you . 
  i do n't understand a single word of german , but would be ok for french and german ( or just german , i do n't mind ) just to see the face of brits .
