  k , thanks for your intervention . 
  https://www.thoughtco.com/countries-of-europe-by-area-1434587 it counts russia and turkey ( which is debatable ) , but sweden is still after spain . 
  i guess it depends if you count oversea territories or not . 
  yeah , and let 's remember that human , elephant , flies , plants and bacteria are all united as living being . 
  seriously , that 's moronic . 
  sure !, 
   culture = / = genetics . 
  genetic exchanges correlate with cultural exchanges ( i think that you can easily understand that when you fuck and have kids with someone , you exchange genes and culture ) . 
  so actually , genetic groups are pretty good way to approxiamte cultural groups . 
  that 's different . 
  only y chromosom and mitochondria can be reliably used to differentiate genetic groups among very close human populations ( that are indeed not very different by nature ) . 
  other genetic markers are massively affected by recombination , so obviously everything looks more homogeneous . 
  you 're talking about the boundaries of the two european groups , of course it 's less clear if you divide germany in two ( and by the way , the iron curtain put also eastern germany in eastern europe ) . 
   your source is not science , thats your biased view . 
  yeah yeah , i just invented it . 
  it 's exactly the same data but colored by the major haplogoup ( because yes , if we want to divide europe , we have summarize the information ) . 
  what it says is just that central europe does n't exist because the big picture is just a continuum between r1b and r1a from west to east . 
  there is n't a `` central european '' haplotype . 
  czechia is not the center of an original genetic group , it 's just a mix of western and eastern haplotypes ( slightly biased toward eastern ) . 
  period . 
  if you insist , here are genetics evidence : https://i2.wp.com/thedockyards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/y-dna_haplogroups_europe_genetic_map.png austria is clearly a mix and would be eastern if united with hungary . 
  and ? 
  i still see a bunch of countries with a domination of the green haplotype that perfectly match my conception of what is western europe . 
  obviously it 's a continuum , but if we have to put a boundary somewhere , it 's clearly between germany and czech republic . 
  austria is debatable . 
  czechia and germany are not , germany are clear red , czechia are clear yellow . 
  https://i2.wp.com/thedockyards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/y-dna_haplogroups_europe_genetic_map.png we can argue forever , but genetically ( which summarize well the cultural exchange between regions ) , czech republic is more linkes to eastern europe than germany . 
  the division are clear with genetics and language , i do n't say that there is no link between germany and czech republic , but it 's crystal clear that if we have to find a boundary in europe , the boundary will be there . 
  science is clear : https://i2.wp.com/thedockyards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/y-dna_haplogroups_europe_genetic_map.png polish and czechs are genetically eastern europeans , period . 
  ok so if you really want to have a debate about how slavic are slavic countries , let 's see what sciens has to say : https://i2.wp.com/thedockyards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/y-dna_haplogroups_europe_genetic_map.png that 's pretty fucking clear , genetically , the limit between eastern and western europe is between germany and czechia . 
  again , it nearly perfectly matches the limit of the iron curtain ( so it makes sense politically ) and science can ensure you that it 's not just a fucking political illusion , countries that share the same dominant haplogroups are countries that share more gene flow throughout history . 
  all the rest is pure litterature . 
  yes , funny to think that spain or france are actually bigger than sweden . 
   germany and czechia have culturally more in common than germany and france . 
  germany is the only country split by the iron curtain , so i guess that it 's legitimate to feel that czechia is closer to eastern germany , but eastern germany only . 
  but let 's be honest : the richest part of germany ( west ) is a lot closer to france . 
  alsacien is a french regional language very close to german , several countries are basically babies of france and germany with french and german as official languages ( switzerland , luxembourg , belgium ) . 
  charlemagne was the king of franks ( basically france + germany ) . 
  btw , the kingdom of charlemagne is very close of my conception of the limits of western europe : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlemagne#/media/file:frankish_empire_481_to_814-en.svg, 
  romanians are a notoriously known exception , everybody knows that they 're the wester europeans of eastern europe . 
  the concept of western and eastern europe is based on the division of the iron curtain . 
  central europe does n't exist . 
  even from a cultural point of view , it does n't make sense to unite germany and czech republic . 
  western europe = roman-germanic cultures easter europe = salvic cultures it perfectly matches the division of the iron curtain , why so much people insist on the concept of `` central europe '' ? 
  because france is culturally very open-minded and saw that japanese anima are cool way before the rest of the world ( even before korea or china ) . 
  that 's surprising , i believed that everybody knew it because even international press widely uses msf ( even the case of this article , btw ) . 
  the fact that msf is more widely used was also my feeling , this dwb is a quite recent trend for me ( but apparently stronger that what i believed given all the downvotes and answers of ignorants believing that it 's just a french rant ) . 
  it 's not true . 
  msf is even a reference understood in popculture like video games : http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/militaires_sans_fronti%c3%a8res, 
   `` since whole article is in english , it 's only fitting that they used english translation of org name , adding msf in parentheses to make francophone purists happy . '', 
  even popculture through a japanese video game is able to have the correct reference in the appropriate language for msf : http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/militaires_sans_fronti%c3%a8res that shoud not be that to have the same level of literacy for european professional journalists at a time when we celebrate and value diversity and authenticity . 
  but given your extremely smart arguments `` we do n't have those funny e '' and `` to make francophone purists happy '' , i think i just get it : we probably just have the journalists we deserve . 
  at least it corresponds to the official acronym . 
   doctors without borders ( msf ) still do n't understand why english speaking press is not able to name organizations according to their actual name . 
  `` doctors without borders '' is `` m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res '' . 
  it 's difficult to say because contrary to many others character , danny and jon do n't have a clear equivalent character . 
  this is not very surprising because the king of france and england that started the hundred years war are not very present in the ak ( the number of deaths and replacement is way higher in the reality/ak than in got , so they just come at the end of the story ) . 
  that 's the main narrative innovation of martin , he 's not limited by historical reality so it was possible to build up the hype for the final battle and he `` invented '' two legitimate charismatic kings ( that 's also why they 're also very one-dimensional characters ) . 
  you mean daenerys ? 
  she has approximately the role of the king of england , one of the legitimate king of france . 
  the other one is jon snow . 
  the end of the show is likely to be a war between them . 
  we also follow and learn to appreciate the french and english branch in the ak , but the end is about their fight . 
  i guess it will be the same and everybody will be surprised because both daenerys and jon snow are seen as the good guys , but it 's not really surprising when you consider lessons from the ak . 
  both book saga are good and unpredictable because they are not manichean , there are no clear bad and good guys . 
  i just hope that the scenario of the serie is still the one written by martin , otherwise i 'm afraid that is will become a classical crappy manichean american show with white walkers as bad guys vs all the good guys . 
  non exhaustive list of common things : - got = everybody wants the iron throne - ak = everybody wants the throne of the iron king ( philipe le bel ) - - the first king die after hunting ( both ak and got ) . 
  - the second king die by poison ( both ak and got ) . 
  also , both kings are very similar , both joffrey and louis x are young , weak and little bit sadistic with sexual issues . 
  - the main character likes feast and prostitutes , is very smart and machiavellian and is abnormaly tall ( robert d'artois in ak ) or small ( tyrion in got ) . 
  both of them are in one side first but have family disputes and go with the ennemy . 
  - both stories feature a strong `` queen '' character hating her husband , loving her son and that finish by getting the power ( cersei = isabelle de france ) . 
  - both stories are about two legitimate royal lineages that fight for the throne . 
  - both stories feature a real king ignoring his origin because he has been exchanged after his birth ( the real origin of jon snow was very predictable ) . 
  - a lot of similarities between the high septon / pope and all the storyline about interactions between religion and power . 
  there are many other things ( lot of characters of got are a mix of other ak characters ) , but globally , the stories are very similar . 
  white walkers are a useless personification of winter and war . 
  they 're role is very secondary in the books , they 're not important . 
  english are represented by both cersei ( = isabelle de france , which was the queen of england in spite of her name ) and daenerys ( the king of england had the same role , returning to his kingdom and believing to be the legitimate king ) . 
   the long winter ended up being the 100 hundred year war ? 
  obviously yes . 
   is jeanne d'arc azor ahai ? 
  it 's either brienne or aria . 
  brienne is a warrior and is virgin ( + same haircut than jeann d'arc ) . 
  aria is also virgin and is a warrior , but aria has also this mystical/religious aspect . 
  both of them have no real role in the current story , so at least one of them is supposed to be jeanne d'arc and will auto-magically save everybody . 
  mark my words . 
  actually got is basically a fantasy copy-cat of the accursed kings . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26824993 martin admitted it because he has no choice , everything follow the same storyline and someone who read the accursed kings can nealrly be sure of the end of got . 
  france is also neutral good , as we 've been trying to explain to you for centuries . 
  the concept of central europe is meaningless . 
  fourme d'ambert is from auvergne while roquefort is from aveyron . 
  they 're not in the same region ( even with the new ones ) . 
  from aveyron , you can pick p\u00e9rail ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a9rail ) . 
  roquefort . 
  everything else is just hard milk trying to have some taste . 
  hard milk . 
   britain has some good cheeses lol, 
  c h a m p a g n e, 
  that 's precisely that .
