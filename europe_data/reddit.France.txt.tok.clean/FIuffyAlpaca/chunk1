subsidiary of renault , but production is still in romania . 
  italian director , shot in spain & italy , italian film crew , italian and german production companies , and the list goes on . 
  apart from the three main actors and probably a bunch of extras , everything in the movie is european . 
  pretty safe to consider it a european movie . 
  edit : the props are also italian-made . 
  switzerland in two weeks . 
  looking forward to it , 
  thanks !, 
  apparently , i speak singaporean english like a swedish person . 
  the thing is , i 'm 100 % french . 
  i do n't know what to think anymore . 
  there are dozens of us !, 
  * dozens !, 
  you mean : paris : best place ever . 
  the rest : what do you mean , the rest ? 
  there 's something else ? 
  it could have worked if it were about scotland . 
  they do have a first minister instead of a prime minister . 
  seems so , otherwise france would be included . 
  alright , this may be weird , but i 've got a question . 
  do other europeans really care about the eurovision ? 
  i mean , i 'm french , and if it were n't for reddit , i would have never known it was this month . 
  whether it 's friends or family , i do n't know anyone who has ever watched it , or cares about it . 
  my comment is not meant to be negative , i 'm just wondering how big of a deal the eurovision is in your respective countries . 
  is n't `` spaniard '' a noun , though ? 
  you should say `` i 'm * a * spaniard '' rather than just `` i 'm spaniard '' .

  dictator, 
  i like you , englishman . 
  depends on what you mean by `` kids '' . 
  reddit 's main demographic is still pretty young , in the 18 to 29 age range . 
  to that list i would add : - the metric system - the cinematograph - the stethoscope - the hot air balloon, 
  nothing of the sort , it 's just a pdf document with some information on europe and your rights as an eu citizen . 
  but then you have to be in brittany, 
  actually we celebrate both . 
  in french , a byte is an * octet * , so a gigabyte ( gb ) is a * gigaoctet * ( * go * ) . 
   before that , the youngest leader was louis-napol\u00e9on bonaparte . 
  you mean napol\u00e9on ? 
  he was 30 when he became first consul , whereas louis-napol\u00e9on was 40 when he became president . 
  what ? 
  haha i do n't know what that warning was but i 've never heard of such a thing here . 
  fun fact : there 's a plaza in paris that used to be called * place de bitche * ( literally , `` bitche plaza '' ) in honor of the village in the picture , which defended itself heroically from the prussians in 1870 . 
  when the americans established their new embassy there , they asked if the name could be changed , for obvious reasons . 
  it 's now called * place des \u00c9tats-unis * , or `` united states plaza '' . 
  `` let us stop the virus '' would be a better translation . 
   it still baffles me that we have n't implemented this . 
  both my middle school and high school had lockers , are n't they commonplace ? 
  well , pretty much . 
  i 'm in the 13th and all theaters around me only show subtitled versions . 
  that being said , this ends as soon as you cross the p\u00e9riph . 
  when was that ? 
  i live in paris and i have n't seen a theater showing dubbed versions in ages . 
  patrick hernandez wrote the song * born to be alive * and that 's pretty much the only thing he ever did . 
  there 's a montpelier in vermont , too . 
  it 's even their capital . 
  it 's a french brand that makes hiking/mountain sports clothes and makes it real easy to spot other french tourists abroad . 
  i 've only lived in apartments with electric heaters , but they were in modern buildings ( mine was built in the 70s ) . 
  i think electric heating is common in newer buildings , while older ones tend to use more `` traditional '' means ( gas , water ) . 
  according to a study i just found online , 46.6 % of french apartments use electric heating , and 45.7 % use natural gas heating . 
  and electricity is n't that much more expensive : according to the same study , it costs on average $ 13.2 / year to heat 1m \u00b2 with gas , while it costs $ 15.7 / year with electricity . 
  apartment in paris : electricity only . 
  true . 
  but i 've never seen a handball match on tf1 at 9pm . 
  rugby probably . 
  it 's the only other sport i can think of that gets broadcast on major tv channels whenever our national team is playing . 
  i live in paris . 
  jaywalking is part of our lifestyle . 
  sorry i misunderstood , i thought you had a much shorter timeframe in mind . 
  yeah , i definitely hope cigarettes are a thing of the past in 100 years . 
  cigarettes should n't be banned . 
  people will keep smoking anyway , but this time the government wo n't get any taxes on it and it 'll just lead to a stronger black market . 
  see : 1919-1933 in the us . 
  paris here .

  we 're not smug . 
  we 're just better than the rest of you provincials / s, 
  i do n't think so ? 
  at least not as far as i know . 
  however it 's true that 3g speeds are disappointing , but i 'm always on lte so i have n't had any complaints . 
  yup . 
  i have n't heard of any french carrier restricting tethering , but i may be wrong . 
   so you get unlimited 4g/lte in france for this price ? 
  indeed . 
   which operator ? 
  free . 
  that being said , there 's a catch : you need to have free as an isp to get the 15.99 plan , otherwise it 'll cost 19.99 and you `` only '' get 100gb of data . 
  for $ 15.99 i get unlimited everything in france , plus unlimited calls/texts and 25gb of data ( 3g ) per month from eu countries + us and some other countries . 
  i 'm not complaining . 
  supposed to reach 32 \u00b0 in paris tomorrow . 
  send help . 
  still monthly in paris . 
  first wednesday of the month . 
  this is culinary barbarism . 
  the famas , but it 's being replaced by the hk416 . 
  we do n't . 
  except in alsace and moselle , which were n't part of the country when the law on separation of church and state was passed in 1905 . 
  however , we do have civic education classes . 
  live in paris , can confirm . 
  pedestrian signals are merely * guidelines * to us . 
  yes .
