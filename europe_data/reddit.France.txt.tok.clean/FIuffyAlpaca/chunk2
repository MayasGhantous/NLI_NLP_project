  not inside , because that 's forbidden , but take a look outside any high school and you 'll see dozens of high schoolers smoking between classes . 
  that 's actually what struck me the most when i first came to high school . 
  i guess as long as you can show an id or passport with a paris/rome address on it , you 're good to go . 
  also in rome : you can enter for free in a bunch of museums if you 're from paris ( and the other way around , most municipal museums in paris are free for romans ) . 
  this is because rome and paris are one another 's only sister cities . 
  granted , this is pretty specific , but not many people seem to know about it , and i think it 's pretty cool , 
  paris here . 
  it would be the [ * \u00cele de la cit\u00e9 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%8ele_de_la_cit%c3%a9?wprov=sfla1 ) , and more specifically , the parvise of notre-dame . 
  not only is the island the location of the original gallic settlement before the roman conquest , it 's also where our kilometer zero is ( meaning the point from which all distances between paris and other cities are calculated ) . 
  [ i have an idea ] ( http://www.emersonkent.com/images/guillotine.jpg ), 
  usually ham and cheese , either like [ this ] ( http://www.actraiteur.net/img/p/7/4/74-large_default.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.da-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lovesmie-721x1024.jpg ) . 
  i 'd say it really depends on who you 're asking . 
  as a college student , my regular lunch is either a sandwich , mcdonald 's , or microwaved pasta ... 
  we do . 
  it 's currently $ 9.76 / h before tax , $ 7.58 after . 
  just as a side note , they are n't castles , they 're ch\u00e2teaux . 
  the word [ does exist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c3%a2teau?wprov=sfla1 ) in english . 
  civ5 taught me that . 
  so do i , 
   here in germany, 
  do n't worry , i 'm just kidding . 
  i do n't think anyone legitimately thinks of napoleon as italian . 
  well , he * was * king of italy for nine years . 
  that 's perfectly valid . 
  did you know that it was inspired by an [ actual ch\u00e2teau ] ( http://www.vinciloirevalley.com/usermedia/photo-635539038990230108-1.jpg?dummy=0&amp;h=800 ) in the loire valley ? 
  i think the canadians came up with * courriel * and we just borrowed it . 
  alcatel phones are n't european . 
  it 's a brand used by tcl , a chinese corporation . 
  alcatel is n't french anymore . 
  it 's a chinese brand now . 
  even though there was french cultural influence in these areas , they 've never been part of france ( except belgium between 1794 and 1814 ) . 
  not really , then . 
  unlike countries like poland and germany , we 've had * roughly * the same borders ever since the end of the 17th century . 
  there was some territorial expansion during the revolution and under napoleon , but the territories did not remain french long enough to have a lasting impact on our history . 
  so , since our borders have n't evolved that much , i ca n't really think of a place in mainland europe that used to be french * and * is a significant part of our history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hammered_coinage   the bottom die ( sometimes called the * anvil die * ) was usually counter sunk in a log or other sturdy surface and was called a * pile * . 
  looks like it 's * pile * too . 
  all of these terms derive from the cuckoo bird , which lays its eggs in other species ' nests . 
  north : scotland south : mauritius east : also mauritius west : san francisco , ca highest altitude : i 'd say at least 3,000 m , somewhere in the alps . 
  lowest altitude : probably somewhere in belgium or the netherlands . 
  well , as in something that would allow two people living together to get tax benefits without actually getting married . 
  are there no civil unions in germany ? 
  no snow at all , winters are pretty mild here . 
  significant snowfalls are pretty rare in paris . 
  rain is n't , though . 
  who said anything about forcing people to join ? 
  most armies in europe are fully professional nowadays , and an hypothetical eu army would surely be as well . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  some of our right wing politicians are going full populist , in a very trump-like way ( sarkozy ... ) . 
  i think marine le pen is a * very * real possibility right now . 
  in all seriousness , there is indeed [ an austrian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_von_coudenhove-kalergi?wprov=sfla1 ) who dreamed of a united europe . 
  the equivalent of your provinces, 
   from my understanding it is because of the catacombs ; is that true ? 
  no , not really . 
  mostly lack of money due to the 1973 oil crisis , and opposition from parisians themselves and from newly elected president val\u00e9ry giscard d'estaing . 
   is it typical for parisians to have toured the catacombs at one point ? 
  i could n't say for sure . 
  based on my own experience , i 'd say most parisians have n't been . 
  the only person i know who 's been did so because he had family visiting from abroad . 
  yeah , it was supposed to spearhead a huge modernization of paris in the late 60s/early 70s . 
  thankfully that did n't happen . 
  nope . 
  there are some regionalist movements , but * very * few want independence . 
  it 's absolutely nothing like what 's happening in spain . 
  virtually non-existent . 
  not so much in metropolitan france . 
  the strongest movements are in brittany and corsica , but their chances of achieving anything are basically zero . 
  however , there are some strong separatist movements overseas , especially in new caledonia . 
  they 're even bound to hold a referendum on independence at some point in the near future , iirc . 
  edit - further reading : [ la d\u00e9centralisation ] ( http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/decentralisation ) ( in french ) . 
  this explains the recent efforts of the french administration towards further decentralization , and why it was added to the constitution . 
  it 'd go like this : 1 . 
  paris 2 . 
  france 3 . 
  rest of europe 5 . 
  surroundings of paris, 
  according to my cousins in the south , i have a parisian accent . 
  which is strange , because they 're the ones with a weird accent . 
  just a minor correction , free france \u2260 vichy france . 
  free france is what we call the territories rallied to de gaulle . 
  that 'd be reason enough to give savoy back to italy . 
  that did n't stop australia from participating in the eurovision :p edit : please stop taking my joke too seriously . 
  nice !, 
  1870 is the french defeat at sedan , which ended the second empire and led to the establishment of the third republic ( which ended with german occupation in 1940 ) . 
  1957 is the signature of the treaty of rome , which , as you pointed out , became effective in 1958 . 
  1958 is for the end of the fourth republic and beginning of the fifth ( with de gaulle as president ) . 
  and 1992 is for the maastricht treaty , which is pretty important for all members of the european union . 
  also , `` viva '' is spanish . 
  the french word is `` vive '' . 
  paris here . 
  we have pigeons . 
  that 's about it . 
  guess whose dorm that weird cheese smell comes from ? 
  not really a thing in france . 
  i think the idea is spreading , but that only applies to a minority of students . 
  most university professors ( at least in my university ) are n't really big fans of the concept . 
  well , it 's either that , or the arabian desert . 
  or the tropical rainforest of french guiana . 
  on the plus side , you 'd get to see rocket launches !, 
  depends on the country .
