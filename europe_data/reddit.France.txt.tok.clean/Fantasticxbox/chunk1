we 'll make cars pay for it . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) i 'm already hard by the picture, 
  probably a german stopping in belgium first . 
  huh ... did i missed something ? 
  i 'm quite happy about your `` strong and stable '' government . 
  it 's just suspended for now apparently but the law is still there . 
  although it is only allowed with shooting .

  what do you mean it ca n't be real since they 've put paint on the bridge before finishing it ? 
  oh , please . 
  why is this getting downvoted ? 
  this man got everything .

  france had 500 francs notes , which was about 75 $ . 
  that 's a lot of them . 
  is n't the european one already revoked ? 
  that 's why i was n't sure she 's gon na loose her protection ... hell i hope she lost it quite fast . 
  but i do n't think it 's gon na go very far since she have once again a protection from justice as a french deputy now . 
  [ and it got down once again ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/29/us/fatal-youtube-stunt/index.html ), 
  yeah , but what have the romans ever done for reddit ? 
  but the fact is that finland is not gon na be attacked because of those nukes . 
  there 's the fear behind it . 
  well technically they are not in france , most likey in international waters . 
  but it makes some country think twice before attacking us . 
  last time we did war it was more like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval ) but whatever ... 
  sorry i ca n't hear you with the french aircraft carrier . 
  i think i could be defended by an european army . 
  and do n't forget that people would think twice if we have a federal army because you know , there 's gon na be nukes from france . 
  do you enjoy your coca cola di\u00e8te ? 
  i ca n't believe i laught at that, 
  do n't forget that uk has an important bill to pay to the eu too . 
  hello dear fellow human . 
  local representatives was already elected since i live in : geolocalisation.exe activated : retrieving data : canada , quebec . 
  all other representatives were eliminated . 
  let 's check if you are human . 
  what is love ? 
  sorry , my pc is still on . 
  that moment when it 's gon na run on bbc news . 
  hue hue hue, 
  [ yes they do , but less victims than sa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/september_11_attacks ), 
  or terrorism to attack , europe too ... edit : although i 'm not saying that iran is a totally peaceful country . 
  it 's just less dangerous than other countries in middle east . 
  still an european case ... 
  `` guys , we 've got an economic crisis and a manspreading problem that nobody see . 
  what do we focus on ? '', 
  too many vowels . 
  edit : a word thanks to u/ljnidan, 
  ' r wlcm, 
  i vote for `` el psy kongroo '', 
  at least they have a bigger ligh poll, 
  macron , do n't do it , do n't fuck him with le pen, 
  i just hope there is n't any pineapple in it ... 
  and skoda, 
  they do n't have the rights to post the little mermaid . 
  so they cut the little mermaid so we can see at least the outline of her . 
  and do n't forget may '68 !, 
  yes indeed . 
  there was also a `` collabo '' and an ex-ss . 
  kinda understandable since a random cessna managed to land near the kremlin . 
  still in the middle of cold war . 
  i 'm personally trigered by the very poor light management . 
  * trudeau arrives * trump give hand , hopes that he will crush trudeau * surprise , trudeau is not pulled by trump * trump shake , trying to pull once again * trudeau pulls * trump fails * canada wins, 
  actually that 's a nice idea . 
  it helps a lot people and piss off turkey, 
  if he does not his part of the deal , we keep the euros . 
  with french permission is a the key part of your sentence . 
  i 'm talking about france not being the only taking the decision for nuclear weapon and maybe not even needed . 
  that 's especially why you need to know who control so we do n't start a nuclear catclysm . 
  if we have a nato like army ( alliance ) , no , france wo n't . 
  if we have a true european army , i think it would give it when it 's gon na be done . 
  even though people will say `` we 're giving up our power '' , that not totally true , since the european union army will be here for france too . 
  and it 's also a very costly power for france alone . 
  if we are all together funding those nukes , we can improve the research for the next generation of nuclear weapons and keep them safe . 
  and this defense force would have the nuclear bomb thanks to france . 
  * alert , illegal encryption of patient file found , contacting nearest it security , awaiting time : 10 years *, 
  who thought that throwing into the baltic sea , chemicals weapons ? 
  baguette is at 1 euro in france . 
  wow danemark got barack obama as a weather guy . 
  sorry , i rewatched the sub anime where they put the wrong one . 
  the kite could be stuck in the plane engine . 
  eu accepted those numbers because we thought it was true . 
  it 's not great but it 's not bad at the same time . 
  if only they had not cheated on their numbers when they entered the eu ... 
  [ i think you can make an answer with this .

  hi , if there is any r/le _ pen or r/t _ d. 
  could you put your tears in a bottle ? 
  people willing to create a new business . 
  a french is less likely to want to create a business ( from the simple barber shop to a accounting company ) . 
  also note that those migrant has a lot of knowledge in computing science ( especially in security ) which we lack a lot . 
  finally only 100k migrants stays in france each year as a lot of them move back home or in another country . 
  deal . 
  all right . 
  and we get trump 's tower so we can add under trump : poopy face . 
  you can buddy . 
  you can . 
  ok but give us back louisiana / s, 
  we did not fuck up guys . 
  yay,
