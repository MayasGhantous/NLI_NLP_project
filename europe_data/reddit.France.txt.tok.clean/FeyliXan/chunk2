  edit : here is what you get when you do things peacefully in turkey . 
  those are pro kurdish rights hdp offices , they have been bombed and set fire to . 
  no investigation , no nothing : https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=z-sr_ywm2dwi.kfmaqygz3ueg, 
  lol a youtube comment eh ? 
  all three countries you gave an example of are linked to the british empire . 
  decolonization has nothing to do with what kurds are going through . 
  nevertheless : india peaceful ? 
  lol . 
  you seem to forget what happened during the creation of pakistan . 
  they are still at war , technically speaking . 
  i 'm really glad you talked about sri lanka : look up the tamils . 
   scotland have been offered the choice twice . 
  kurds have n't been offered a choice once . 
  [ kurdish civilians being shot in the streets by turkish army , nsfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvd2c8dvozm&amp;feature=youtu.be ) edit : since i 'm getting the `` it 's fake '' argument i 'm just going to post additional information ** that is verified with links ** map of all the pro kurdish hdp offices that were bombed , set fire to etc. . . 
  note that there is never an actually investigation or anything : https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=z-sr_ywm2dwi.kfmaqygz3ueg what about the execution of dilek dogan in her own home by turkish police ? 
  ( nsfw ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxkbpl_e4to i mean the list is super long . 
  i 'm not going to go on for ever here , but keep in mind it 's extremely difficult to obtain media access to the south east in turkey because turkey is ranked number 149 on the world ranking of freedom of press . 
  russia is number 152 . 
  name one country or group of people in the world that have achieved this entirely peacefully, 
  it 's very complicated and dumbing it down to `` it 's a terrorist organization '' is just in bad faith . 
  you have to understand what happened in the 90 's , like the ban of the kurdish language and things like that . 
  the turkish army is also notoriously disregarding of basic human rights in their regular and destructful deployments to the south east . 
  newroz p\u00eeroz be , 
  i grew up most of my life in france , out of respect , when i comment on european issues , i wear my french flair . 
  does n't make me less kurdish though , 
  haha, 
  it 's so annoying, 
  wish i knew . 
  as terrible as the bombings in ankara and istanbul are ( and they are terrible ) , hundreds more civilians die in the south east . 
  it 's a fucking warzone . 
  everything is destroyed . 
  you barely hear about this . 
  there was an excellent documentary done by arte that showed everything that is going on in kurdistan , but that 's pretty much it . 
  only russians bother to cover it otherwise . . 
  there no good or bad guys . 
  if you want to form an opinion , go check both r/kurdistan and r/turkey and look at what people are saying and posting . 
  you 'll see it 's not that easy . 
  and yes , pkk has been fighting isis , and still is . 
   withot anyone doing anything to prevent it . 
  you are so full of shit . 
  there is an entire organization that is focusing on educating the villages that are still practicing it , and it 's very successful in doing so . 
  it 's celebrated in iran also !, 
  i think it started in iran, 
  i really , really , really hope so . 
  it 's a kurdish festival . 
  you mean to tell me pkk would bomb kurds at a kurdish festival , that celebrates kurdish culture ? 
  the kurdish site states that newroz ( kurdish new year 's celebration ) is banned in turkey . 
  and it is banned . 
  it has nothing to do with bias or not . 
  it 's just a harmless cultural celebration that is banned . 
  as for the rt video , i 'd recommend watching it nevertheless . 
  but the turkish army is much better . 
  even an international model for human rights .

   `` poepen '' such a great word, 
  efficiency is key to the economy . 
  while china is ripping everybody off by copying and dumping solar panels , germany can always stay one step ahead by developing better and more efficient technologies in order to keep their market shares . 
  that is very true . 
  i think the nuclear plants were closed off too soon . 
  squeaky cheese is truly underrated, 
  tell us more . 
   inhale dandruff i lost my shit at that one hahaha, 
  i 'd say i understand most of them but there 's a few i would n't have guessed . 
  like `` that 's not bad '' , i would think it means , it 's not too good but not too bad either . 
  if i had n't read the chart i would 've never guessed what this means haha, 
  haha, 
  is this true ? 
  how accurate is it ? 
  nah , canadians are seen as the nice overly polite neighbor that ca n't be taken seriously because they say shit like `` aboot '' instead of `` about '' . 
  think of it as the relationship between flanders and homer in the simpsons . 
  i 'm sorry i jumped to conclusions before even asking . 
  it 's messed up man i hope the admins are going to help out then . . is there no way to implement a different voting system ? 
  like making the votes unapparent for a much longer time ? 
  i suppose you guys have tried to come up with solution before . 
  that the mods are n't doing anything about this is truly a problem . 
  something should be done . 
  we are basically censored from speaking . 
  you say one thing that does n't align with the consensus and everybody downvotes you into oblivion and attacks you . 
  i mean they are clearly breaking the rules of reddit : do n't downvote just because you do n't disagree . 
  i agree with every single thing you said . 
  edit : i 'm not sure it 's been always like that , but keep in mind that people like us do exist , but they choose not to comment on this sub for obvious reasons . 
  you are way too reasonable , informed and smart to comment on this subreddit . 
  i use it only to observe racists , fascists and people who obtain their information from shitty tabloids that sell fear and racism because it makes a lot of money . 
  consider it a social experiment but for people that are unable to think for themselves because they are so afraid of others . 
  i mean when you really think about it , all of the hate that is based on little stories from tabloids , actually boils down to fear . 
  it 's much easier to be afraid and to hate the unknown than to study it and understand it . 
  there is also no point in providing proof or information to back up what you are saying because there is mob mentality here . 
  as soon as someone gets downvoted , everybody else does it automatically without even thinking about it . 
  i 'd recommend you stop trying to waste your time trying to talk to them and observe them and learn their behavior instead . 
  that way when you are one on one with somebody like that , you can obliterate them and their ridiculous beliefs , and then * actually * make a difference . 
  there is however , no use in trying to reason with a mob . 
  woops sorry about that !, 
  if a country goes to shit in europe , like for example in france , the primary and vastly more important reason is because of the incredible disparity in wealth distribution . 
  there were lots of migrants in france in the 60 's and 70 's , but nobody gave a shit because there was economic growth and there were jobs . 
  people could make a decent living . 
  now there are no more jobs left , but the people turn to the poor minorities for their troubles , not to the ultra super rich 1 % minority that actually holds all of the economic and political power . 
  come on man . 
  that 's straight up insane , nobody is that big of a psycho . 
  who would take the risk of burning dozens of their * own * people alive just because the location of the building is not ideal in their opinion ?
