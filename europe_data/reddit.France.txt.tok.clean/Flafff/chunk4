  now the ue wants uk out , it 's uk who is take their time to trigger article 50 . 
  what a bunch of assholes ... 
  just an unfortunate coincidence !, 
   you have to realize that a lot of people did n't understand what they were doing do you realise that , if the government does n't follow people 's opinion on an official referendum that makes a huge precedent to just never follow referenda anymore ? 
  and what do you do with people who voted leave and still want it ? 
   and most of the press are calling out the leave campaigns lies press largely contributed to the leave campaign tho ... 
  you forgot `` more power for eu 's leading countries such as germany and france '', 
  no , in both cases uk will have less power to get new deals . 
  if they stay in it will not be possible to use their usual `` europe must go our way or we leave europe '' . 
  which will happen if they are in a. 
  position of loosing . 
  just like any other country with nuclear power, 
  his point is it 's not because a country is not a super power that it can not be a big treat . 
  your grand father decorations have nothing to do here, 
  yeah ... no it 's not ... * us : 17.39 billion * europe : 20 billion * japan : 22.29 billion [ source ] ( http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/video_game_industry ), 
   it 's americans making american stuff for americans damn , i was almost sure games were sold in almost every western countries . 
  agree with that : go in england , you are expect to speak english ( normal ) . 
  an english speaker comes to your country , everyone is expected to speak english to them , if you they do n't they are arrogant/force to use their language ... and of course , every country is expected to learn english , while they would n't bother to learn another . 
  i believe the uk government and media blamed the eu for pretty much every issues the country had and when it will exit ( cause apparently , it 's what is expected to happen ) , people will eventually realise ( after months of using the `` exit of europe '' as excuse of course ) that most of those issues were not caused by eu policies/rules/regulations . 
  there is often a reason for strikes tho , not always a good one but often yes . 
  no single market does n't mean no access to the market at all you know, 
  so bad people we must kill in game will be 50 % females instead of 100 % males ? 
  i do n't know how it is for other countries but in france do n't blame people . 
  recycling is a huge pain cause they are super picky on what they accept to recycle ... 
  [ and france has only 8 % of population under the poverty line , against 15 for us and 14 for uk ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/economy/population-below-poverty-line ), 
  i 'm surprised there is no `` curved banana '' in the list, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_passports some are green , some are blue , some are red . 
  there is no more reason to have it blue than to have it green or red, 
  well having a dictator as a head of state should disqualify you ... 
  he just did n't want france to b usa 's little bitch like uk was and still is, 
  it 's not exactly new that some companies have dressing codes, 
  not ca n't , do n't want sadly, 
  syria has a negative index ? 
  do n't be silly , upper class people rarely face jail, 
  but a good school is definitly not one to only increase the level of the 1 or 2 kids who were already highest, 
  her chin and mouth , just too big and looks odd . 
  cause it 's mainly aimed toward kids and teenagers who are n't exactly able to make well thought choices . 
  you are living with your family meaning you 'll likely have to stay ( even if at least for a while ) with your assaulter so it 's likely to happen more than once . 
  well he wants to crush others , not `` deal '' with them per say . 
  because the us manages to attract researchers from other countries . 
  it 's a tendency that can switch relatively fast if another world power put enough money on the table to attract them . 
  my bad then, 
   i do n't think `` leading '' = dominating then you are a moron, 
  i know gtfo ( go to fuck off ) but what does btfo means ? 
  i do n't think you should hope trump would be any less arrogant or shitting any less on other countries . 
  well it 's written italy up left and can you can see houses and trees getting knocked . 
  they all are bankers !, 
  so you say since the 2 first world war were not started by the us , then it 's impossible they start the third ? 
  strange logic, 
  i just hope he 'll fuck up enough to reduce influence of the usa on the rest of the world , but not enough to start the third world war . 
  well it 's always hurtfull to be considered less valuable just cause of your country you are from and not because of who you are . 
  fortunately everyone i know in uk have nothing against europeans and everyone i know in france have nothing against uk people . 
  i do n't understand the `` complex regulations '' as disadvantage since it 's the same for every country in the ue while it would be harder to follow x diff\u00e9rent regulations for x different countries . 
  so at the moment you are in the us ? 
  i see sacramento on your site, 
  which show they are not `` asylum seekers '' but `` money seekers '' ? 
  yeah well france too should switch to gmt in all logic, 
  would work for me : o, 
  yes , eu should have done more against him already, 
  well i hope their had a bunch of bodyguards as wedding gift ... 
  he is completely right on that . 
  [ those ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/overview_en.html ), 
  us also have anti trust laws ... 
  when last did you even tried another e-mail service ? 
  another map service ? 
  another shopping compare service ? 
  another video service ? 
  you probably use all those because it 's google , you are lasy to change , you do n't look any further giving no change to the competition ( even if they would have a better service ) . 
  just the shopping ? 
  how about maps ? 
  how about the emails ? 
  but , do you have to build it yourself ? 
  like if gives you the chemicals and a manual ? 
  estonia one is pretty awesome i must say, 
  for greece , could do [ that ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ezooz ), 
   i like the idea , but a danish flag without the cross is just wrong d : [ there for danemark ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yc1yy ) and [ for lituania ] ( http://imgur.com/a/efonv ), 
  some need work but i like the concept . 
   in many cases yes it 's dumb ; in this case , what you get is exactly what people wanted . 
  this case is very specific . 
  people vote for a political party more than for a person . 
  people do n't have the choice between 3 persons from lrem ,2 from ps and 5 from fn . 
  they have 1 lrem vs 1 ps vs 1 fn ( and others ) . 
  candidats abilities ( or gender ) do n't really matter as much as you 'd think or hope . 
  but it 's also why it 's better for a party to have half half . 
  i 'm actually surprised so many people still voted conservative , with everything stupid may said and did ... 
  they can declare what they want it does n't make it real, 
  frankly i did n't know we were sending money to turkey, 
  it does n't , but if it can also piss putin off ( or even trump ! ), 
  it 's just a bonus, 
  hard and firm, 
  yeah just ... no . 
  but yet again , it 's juncker and it 's probably part of his strange sense of humor/trolling . 
  sadly there are too many stupid people , and too many think the past can not repeat . 
  i think it 's more of a way for eu to say they 'd like it to happen , without causing too much international drama . 
  and `` go to jail '' !, 
  so it 's bad cause us lost the market to russia ? 
  yeah , it 's really a shameful bahavior, 
  fanatics cheering for their guru . 
  nothing to see, 
  can take the bus , or can do with other people in the same car,
