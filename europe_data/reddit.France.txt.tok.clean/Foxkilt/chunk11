  fingerbox ? 
  i 'm going with fingerbox because i have * never ever * heard of another kind of box here . 
  but even the us can not afford their military spendings . 
  all global regulations have started somewhere at a point . 
  well , `` planche-neige '' ( et les step-in ) is kinda silly, 
  do n't you have black priests in your parishes ? 
  it is fairly common in france . 
  sure , because on a market with 3-4 actors/country , the price of things really reflects their marginal costs . 
  to easy to pocket-call , i , d say . 
  it represents a big share of the budget only because it is one of the two big programs that the eu takes care of . 
  being protectionist is common sense when everyone else is ( pretty much all developed nations have agricultural subsidies ) . 
  although it is true that , mostly due to my governments ' influence , the eu is not too verbose about ending it during wto talks . 
  10 years out of the eu and the uk has to change its entire global strategic policy !? 
  the butterfly effect is really everywhere . 
  i found [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9811265/david-cameron-can-prove-de-gaulle-was-right-about-us-all-along.html ) for you . 
   but if it had been pig ... then the `` true briton '' ( also the stereotypical redditor ) would have the opposite opinion and say they do not see what the fuss is all about , woudl n't he ? 
  as i said earlier , there probably would not have been so big of a reaction if the news was `` turkey found in chicken nuggets '' . 
  sure those companies are at fault , but the uproar seems too big . 
  the one saying `` the uk will keep being more atlantist and more skeptical towards a political union than the continent '' ? 
  seems incredibly unfair indeed . 
   meps which ones ? 
  the author his himself a mep . 
  imo more balanced , more informative and overall better than the telegraph 's story on the subject . 
  given the current size of the eu budget there is largely enough room for increase . 
   `` as unelected president of the european parliament how do you think he got the job ? 
   a deal that would squeeze the eu budget and cut billions from the pay and perks for european bureaucrats . 
  in the whole eu ( country by country ), 
  not well . 
  `` we can not stand here in strasbourg at our second seat -- this icon of eu profligacy -- and say that there is no money that can be saved '' technically , it is brussels who is the second seat . 
  except that preventing someone from having a function because of his friends is a gross violation of rights . 
  if you go that way everyone wants a single seat for the parliament . 
  it is just that some want it be in strasbourg , others in brussels . 
  you have missed the `` at every step '' part . 
   continues to spend like a drunken sailor example ? 
  ( other than mali ( which is , btw , not war against another country ) ), 
  you can really not see the difference in `` feeding quality '' between [ this ] ( http://www.agrigate.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/agrigate/cocoon/transfer/bild/big/beratungstipp//weidendekuhliebegg.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.upplandsstiftelsen.se/temp/9aa7f0930b8558914f2411510b74c995_2a1178e37a789c3795e4ea9c04429201.jpg ) ? 
  you could try and find a more attractive image , but still , there is a reason why people make their cows graze in meadows instead of forests when they can . 
  and on a more general note , you really think it is unfair that subsidies put incentives on producing in the most fertile regions of the eu ? 
   subsidies make a playing field unequal . 
  they give one nation ( or in most cases select companies from that nation ) an advantage over the others . 
  but since every ( developped ) nation does it , not having subsidies would be an disadvantage towards the others . 
  you can disagree with hollande and be pro-eu . 
  that is verhofstadt exactly . 
  but it is france belief that the cap is in the eu interest ( or else why would n't we just have our own subsidies scheme ? ), 
  a decent point would be the maintaining of the parliament in strasbourg ( but that is also far less costly of course ), 
  [ o rly ? 
  ] ( http://cdn.overclock.net/8/89/89903ba8_447d1319447575-queensland-new-south-wales-internships-thank-you-captain-obvious-lg.jpeg ), 
  in france it is free for those under 25 and for the unemployed . 
  `` how productive people are '' is not very related to `` how hard people work '' either . 
  countres with austerity like spain , portugal , greece , italy ? 
  welfare countries like germany , sweden , netherlands ? 
  and of course , the idea is not `` let 's take everything they have '' , rather `` we want to create some kind of maximum salary . 
  let 's add some flexibility for those who really want a higher salary '' ( for example , i believe the psg factored in the tax to determine ibrahimovic 's salary ) the paradox is that i guess most people who cry over `` the tax '' would have been quite fine with a maximum salary , despite the fact that it would have been a harsher law . 
   some more people who is taxed at 75 % now ? 
  taking back the cities is the easy part ( inferior forces , no support from local population ) . 
  it is destroying the islamists ' bases in the desert which is going to take a long time ( and i believe the french pan is `` let the african do that '' ), 
  it finally has been spared to us , but it could have been a protest against a former protest against a gay marriage bill . 
  there is actually a difference between octet and byte : some old systems used to have 6-bit bytes . 
  car coming itself from the french char ( or more precisely from norman french , wherein ch was pronounced k ( see also cat ) ), 
  you know , their job is to propose terms and to get ignored or laughed at ( and , sometimes , people think that one of their word is actually good ), 
  but you can say the same for any language . 
  is it * de belles \u00e9tendues sauvages * or * de belles sauvages \u00e9tendues * ( or * de belles , sauvages \u00e9tendues * , the meaning is entirely different ) . 
  why is `` genou '' not spelled `` jenou '' ? 
  because it comes from the latin genu , where g and j do not make the same sound . 
  what about `` force '' , why is it not `` fortitude '' ? 
  wait , `` fortitude '' does exist , but does not mean the same thing . 
  is it `` je '' or `` moi '' ? 
  and why do you say `` lui et moi faisons '' when `` lui et moi '' are clearly the subject . 
  theoretically there is , but fact is most regional accents consist in taking all those similar sounds and lumping them together in one that is unique to this region . 
  of course , as a native of the loire valley i am spared , but i do pity those fools who pronounce * lait * as in * bl\u00e9 * . 
  yeah but marriage law involves fidelity here . 
  apparently some people do not want their partner to force them to stop being unfaithful . 
  [ and yet ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_rebate ), 
  i guess it has to do with the german , dutch ... `` rebate on the rebate '' but france , italy and spain do end up paying ~ 60 % of the british rebate . 
  and note that my initial point was `` it would be cheaper for france to have a domestic subsidy program '' . 
  erasmus : university exchanges eurozone : the euro $ $ schengen : schengen area : free movement of citizens between those countries eufor : common european military operations . 
  some kind of embryo of a common defense policy . 
  all countries do not pay the rebate equally . 
  and as for policies , i guess it is more `` should we subsidies food production/independance '' ( iirc , the uk trashed its own subsidy program ) than pure bookkeeping . 
  in that case i dodged ( by chance ) the problem : i used the spreadsheet version , [ wherein both are lumped together . 
  choosing the eu-schemes you want to be part of : `` i 'd like to take some erasmus and eurozone , but no schengen and eufor . '', 
   i 'm not sure you can count only the national contributions as that also excludes a non negligible portion of the harmonized vat . 
  is n't the `` national contribution '' the sum of gni-based contribution and vat contribution ? 
  once again , the polls prove very reliable : http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/une-large-majorite-de-francais-favorable-au-maintien-du-royaume-uni-dans-l-ue-26-01-2013-1620609_23.php ( 58 % for the uk staying ) but interestingly 68 % of the french say they prefer an `` integrated europe '' over an europe \u00e0 la carte ( 32 % ), 
  one of them is ~ ~ waterloo ~ ~ leipzig when our most famous citizen got exiled , before making a hopeless comeback attempt . 
  true . 
  but then i think the figure for th eu budget should be only the `` national contributions '' ( which excludes custom duties : it is likely that agricultural imports/exports would change , but it is fuzzy how ) . 
  * total member-states ' contribution : 103.216 billion $ * total direct aid to agriculture : 39.663 billion $ * french direct contribution to the eu budget : 18.050 billion $ * estimated french contribution to the cap : 18.050 x 39.663 / 103.216 = 6.936 billion $ * french cap subsidies : 8.007 g $ * uk rebate payment ( as it is directly motivated by the cap ) : 0.967 g $ * conclusion : we only got about 100 m $ from the cap in 2011 . 
  and considering the share of french farmers is steadily falling ( and rightly so ) i 'd we passed net contributor in 2012 . 
  for the uk now : * total member-states ' contribution : 103.216 billion $ * uk contribution to the eu budget : 11.213 billion $ * estimated uk contribution to the cap : 3.983 billion $ * uk cap subsidies : 3.296 billion $ * uk rebate : 3.595 g $ * conclusion : the uk got 2.9 billion euro out of the cap . 
  congratulation uk , you just passed farming leech , 
  you forgot to take out the uk rebate . 
  i have made the calculation once : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14qd4c/french_pm_wealthy_individuals_moving_abroad/c7fp03y, 
  france is not the biggest beneficiary of the cap . 
  it would actually be cheaper for france to have national subsidies . 
  ... and because the italian parliament though it would be a nice idea to have someone competent . 
  i do not see the flaw in democracy here . 
  promote peace and brotherhood across europe . 
  reflect the fact that we want to be together rather than in rival ( and thus sometimes ennemy ) countries . 
  and for that we try to make it so that the interests of one country is also the interest of the whole union .
