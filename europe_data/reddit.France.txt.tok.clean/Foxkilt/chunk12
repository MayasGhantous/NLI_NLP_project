   europe a la carte , or whore of big business ? 
  what will they choose ? 
  the european way , which is neither of the above : subsidiarity . 
  it is agreeable that in that case , this is not a competence the eu should have ( and arguably , not even the state , rather smaller districts ) . 
  that does not mean \u00e0 la carte : when it is relevant to do things eu-wide , it applies to the whole eu . 
  what makes you think the french government is interested in decreasing anti-eu sentiment in the uk ? 
  the mere fact of counting `` who is a contributor and who is not '' shows that . 
  the eec was not created to strengthen the economy of the countries . 
  rather the unification of the economies was a tool to have `` an ever closer union among the european peoples '' . 
  what was maastricht for ? 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/27/newsid_4187000/4187714.stm  at a news conference at the elysee palace in paris , attended by more than 1,000 diplomats , civil servants and ministers as well as journalists , general de gaulle accused britain of a `` deep-seated hostility '' towards european construction . 
   he said france would back commercial exchanges with britain - `` be it called association or by any other name '' - but that was all . 
  i find it surprising that after having thrown so much at de gaulle for basically saying `` you do not want what we want with the eec '' the uk seems to be proving him right . 
  and yes , the eec always was a political project , never just an economic zone . 
  its very preamble of the treaty creating it speaks of `` an ever closer union between the people of europe '' , `` ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide europe '' , `` guarantee steady expansion '' ... it was pretty obvious that it was the start of a closer political union . 
   let 's not forget the time they agreed to a 25 % reduction in the british rebate in exchange for cap reform . 
  and then did n't reform the cap . 
  so after a speech made about a brexit referendum , a poll shows that the uk is the only eu country wherein the image of the eu is more negative than positive . 
  how is that ridiculous ? 
   all it really shows is that there are more people in the uk who have and unfavourable opinion of the eu that is all that it intends to show . 
  anyone skimming through the article would read `` all coutries but the uk have an overall positive opinon '' . 
  but it is not the ec who sets the future of the eu . 
   for the past few years the eu 's future has been determined by eurocrats and eurocrats alone . 
  you consider the heads of member-states eurocrats ? 
  do n't you pay for your lunch in a cafeteria ? 
  what has this to do with that ? 
  roughly half the memer-states are . 
  well there was [ that ] ( http://www.wat.tv/video/en-allemagne-ayrault-parle-5cmfn_2exyh_.html ) , but as i understand it , the reaction to it was ... furchtbar . 
  i do n't think chirac would either tbh . 
  that would be [ a bit insulting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_shepherd_dog_%28malinois%29 ) . 
  there used to be a time when french leaders got symphonies composed for them . 
  now all they have is children who will use their 2nd name anyway . 
   reached a surprise agreement that will ease some of the country 's labour-market rigidities [ ... ] and some bits of the deal , such as a requirement for firms to provide top-up health coverage for employees , or higher taxes on very short-term work contracts , will actually add new costs for employers . 
  yes eco . 
  that is why it is called an agreement , not a diktat . 
  the real question is : will they change their mind as they grow older ? 
  yeah , but the new big transport plane ( a400m ) is to be delivered in the next couple of years . 
  i think they meant bailouts , not contribution to budget . 
  i have to admit that i do not know to what extent britain contributed to bailouts . 
  something for you boys to discuss : http://www.one-city.eu/en/index, 
  are n't the irish figures a bit biased by americans claiming an irish heritage ? 
  duke being a deformation of * dux bellorum * : warchief . 
  this is the source : a national statistics agency providing a graph . 
  if it is the only thing you need to stop being obnoxious i can link you to [ wall of french text ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=14 ) though . 
  out of date ? 
  the last figure is unemployement for the 3rd quarter of 2012 , which was released last month . 
  what more recent figure could you reasonably want ? 
  with no source ? 
  do you want me to read the url for you : [ insee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insee ) . fr, 
  right ... you [ can really see a change in the trend ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/indicateurs/ind14/20121206/graph_cho_nvir.png ) in mid-2012 . 
  ( total unemployement in france ), 
  it has not even been implemented yet !, 
  sometimes i mistake / r/europe for / r/worldnews, 
  the malian government asked for french help . 
  in the car , the rebels and the government have signed a ceasefire . 
   i hope hollande 's stay in power is worth it . 
  given the alternative , frankly yes . 
  if you look a bit in the recent french political history , the socialist party is the only one who has really reformed anything ( which is a bit biased , since the only socialist government in recent history was jospin ) . 
  note also that the socialist party is somewhat more economically liberal than the ump ( never a right-wing minister would have said jospin `` the state can not solve everything '' ) . 
  but it is true that they are far less pro-capitalism ( which is not a contradiction in a european country : less regulation/intervention , but the remaining intervention are aimed at not giving the capital too much power ) . 
   nah , before depardieu came along there were news of some others , depardieu just made all the waves as he 's known and because he basically told hollande to go fuck himself . 
  exactly some others ( most notably arnault ) . 
  and each one had his article . 
  i counted less than 10 of those . 
   yes , i know it wo n't be these draconian laws , but they do have a negative impact on your overall competitiveness , it wo n't be much of an issue on the next year or so but it will have its toll as time goes by . 
  it always does . 
  is there any european country with employement-at-will ? 
  the budget argument stemmed from your `` investement in housing argument '' . 
  the fact that the deficit is shrinking shows you that it is possible to make necessary investments ( the lack of which is probably the biggest way austerity can screw things up ) and reduce the deficit by both cutting spendings and increasing taxes ( the most lucrative increases being probably the 41 % -  45 % for the top rate and 19.6 % -  20 % for the vat . ), 
  hooray , ignorance once again !, 
  [ immigrants as share of the general population ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/ipweb/ip1098/img/carte.jpg ) ( 2005 ) [ fertility ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/insee_regions/midi-pyrenees/themes/six_pages/6p_n135/fecondite_region.png ) ( 2008 ), 
   we [ who is that exactly ? 
  ] ( http://capreform.eu/eurobarometer-poll-shock-europ-love-the-cap/ ), 
  * deter people from having such high revenue to ease off the feeling of social unfairness . 
  * prove that hollande is not the `` friend of the rich '' which is basically why sarkozy were not really able to reform the country : any of its attempt was met with contempt because it was assume to benefit only to `` the rich '' ( especially big bosses who were his personal friends ) . 
  * ultimately avoid facing to much opposition when doing the needed reforms ( the recent `` 20 bn $ tax rebate to promote competitivity '' has not sparked much reaction for example . 
  the incoming reforms of the work contract and the rise of retirement age will be much more accepted than under sarkozy . 
  * additionaly : keep his campaign promises . 
  again the people with `` that amount of income '' can all leave , in term of number of people leaving there still would not be the massive exode you claim there is . 
  and the fact that depardieu moving was so mediatised shows you how discrete someone very rich leaving is . 
  if there are indeed more people leaving than usual ( i remind you we have basically no figure ) then it has nothing to do with the 75 % tax ( since they would not pay it ) . 
   no , the state interfering with the labour market is n't good for the workers on the long run like it or not , the state intervenes and will intervene . 
  their are plenty of ways you can fire someone for free ( objectives not met ( in a repeated fashion and given that the objectives could have been met ) for example ) . 
  the bone of contention here is a shrinking of your activity : if you want to lay off people to face it , it will cost you . 
  the objective is both to finance the benefits for people laid off and to deter companies from using it : other ways are seen as preferable . 
  these ways were deemed insufficient hence the current negotiations about workforce flexibility . 
   `` france is in free fall '' is the name of the article and you 're telling me you 're in great shape ? 
  `` france is in free fall '' is an abusive title which , anyway , was referring only to competitivity , not the budget . 
   i do n't think anyone pays taxes just to create a competition for themselves / their kids , that would be weird !, 
  how can you still be believing that the objective of the 75 % tax i increasing revenue to a significant extent ? 
  nope , because the cap is not about sustaining the french agriculture but about ensuring food independence , which only makes sense continentally-wise . 
  that has not much to do with his mandate . 
  you realize that france pays more money to the cap than what french farmers receive for it right ? 
  i counter your nice image by the toilet cleaner who pushes his children to study , sometimes too hard because he wants them not to have the same job he has . 
  oppositely , the spoiled brat who does nothing in class and who gets away with it because his parents work too much to really care . 
  there were no really bad student in my elementary class , but in my high school class , the bad students had doctor/engineer/businessmen parents . 
  since when do toilet cleaners care less about their children 's homework than rich people ? 
  and even if it were the case , the solution would be something like an hour per day in school to do said homework with teachers , not deterring the poor from making children . 
  my claim is that those `` massive '' departures , if they are a fact , are not a consequence of an indecent taxation since those who leave are not affected by it . 
  what ?
