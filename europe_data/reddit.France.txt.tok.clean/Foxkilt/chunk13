  you really can not fathom a system wherein you do not answer to variations in activity by laying off people ? 
  the deficit is shrinking , so i do not see exactly what you are bitching about with your `` piling on debt '' . 
  not renovating housing is also a burden on future generations . 
   currently 2 , 2.1 would be replacement 2.08 actually . 
  which , given the low infantile mortality , should more or less ensure replacement . 
   quality of births . 
  it does ( should ) not matter . 
  we have public schools and a somewhat meritocratic system for this reason . 
  you sound almost swiftic , but without the irony . 
  edit : formatting, 
   enough to get the people rich out . 
  so a rise of the top rate from 41 % to 45 % ( so to the level of the uk ) and an 2-year long 75 % contribution for the ~ 2000 person who earn more than 1m is enough to get a significant number of people out ? 
   `` the main idea is to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it 's not worth it , '' sapin said in an interview with france info radio there is a difference between firing someone and having a flexible ( but secured ) workforce . 
   there would will be more social housing , and development funds for deprived suburbs well , yeah . 
  the fact that you cut spendings does not mean that you have to cut them everywhere . 
  there is such a thing as a necessary investment . 
   increasing taxes true , but not that much actually . 
   stricter labour laws there are n\u00e9gociations currently going on to introduce more flexibility . 
   spending more on social benefits !, 
  with 20 bne cuts ? 
  this trimester is the first one for a long time when the `` s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale '' 's payments have fallen . 
  maybe instead of just looking at his party 's name you could actually look up the facts . 
  i restate my doubts : on what legal basis can someone prevent an illegal alien from leaving the country ? 
  well since leaving the country is not illegal ( for illegal immigrant , that is even required ) , i really do not see on what ground the french authorities could act . 
   you can understand the initial motivation for this thread and the subsequent posts put forward speaking for this subthread , was n't it a discussion over the use of `` we want you out '' as opposed to `` i want you out '' which changed nothing to the main point ? 
  your aggressivity seems a bit useless then . 
   the port officials at calais do literally nothing to stop them . 
  what do you think british custom officers are for ? 
  that is ** their ** role , not the port operator 's . 
  the echr is not part of the eu and has , in fact , nothing to do with it . 
  to be honest , the [ russian federation ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/russian_regions-en.svg/1000px-russian_regions-en.svg.png ) is not the simplest one . 
  i 'm pretty sure you will not be arrested for having measured your kid 's heigh in inches . 
  what i meant is that the restriction and tariffs are fairly low compared for other countries ( say , for an extreme example , brazil ) . 
  even if there was a law to  measure everything in metric or face prosecution you are still free to use whatever measurement you want . 
  except not when it involves a contract that your government is supposed to enforce ( as in a sale ) . 
  the eu i far more free-markety than the other major powers though . 
  actually reforms are on the way . 
  there are currently pre-law negotiations ( between workers and businesses unions ) about the flexibility of the workforce . 
  the pensions will be reformed . 
  their are more and more talks about a big fiscal reform . 
  and that is only for the economical/fiscal parts . 
  the left-wing is actually far more likely to reform anything than the right . 
  as for the unions ' power , it is actually quite feeble . 
  they are not really the ones who make a demonstration big or small . 
  their only relevance is that they are the ones the government negotiates with . 
  that is populist to say : `` unemployement will grow during all 2013 '' ? 
  on the other hand , an inability to do any reform would probably cost the country far more . 
  the retirement system will probably be reformed next year . 
  there already have been a reform 3 years ago , which resulted in massive strikes , demonstrations and probably costed sarkozy his reelection . 
  but apparently the reform has been half-assed and tougher measures will need to be taken . 
  i think the unions ' reaction to this will tell if the symbols have been efficient or not ( and when i say unions ' reaction , i mean how they will be able to gather people against it . 
  most people are not unionised and chose whether they want to follow the protest or not ), 
  but was n't that for wealth above 1.5 msvk ? 
  we are talking about a tax on * income * . 
  as for pr , there is a good bit of confirmation bias `` see how ineptly socialist those french are '' . 
  among the french real socialist , where holland is seen as a frontman for the evil capital they look only at the pro-business/cutting spendings measures and not so much at the rest . 
  really that does not matter . 
  with such a huge * assiette * the tax would concern about 1500 taxpayers ( and many of them sportsmen , actors , artists ) . 
  not enough to make a difference , it is only a symbol aimed at keeping to communist calm while having a not-really-leftist policy . 
  you will be no matter what . 
  a suez2 for example . 
  their is a difference between capitalistic and liberal , mind you . 
  6th richest , but ~ 4 % of the world economy , and not much prospect to grow further . 
   our language is the language adopted worldwide for business . 
  france was present in afghanistan during the libya intervention . 
   they said the same to the greeks , irish , italians , spanish etc. 
  and it was true . 
   i prefer a country which does n't have territorial disputes with half of its neighbors . 
  purely coincidental but [ actually ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_areas_disputed_by_canada_and_the_united_states ), 
  sentiment ( noun ) / ressentir ( verb ) and `` pneu '' is a shortened version of `` pneumatique '' which comes from latin * pneumaticus * : which relates to air . 
  why would n't sexism be less ok than ageism ? 
  if i have to insure someone against breast or prostate cancer , i 'd like to know . 
  same for diseases some ethnic groups are more likely to have ? 
  why setting the bar at age ? 
  sidenote :  the draft directive unveiled on wednesday has to be endorsed by member governments and the european parliament , which could take three years . 
  see how undemocratic the eu is . 
  i did not read the whole article , but the beginning , although it looks circumstantial was already conflicting with what i know . 
   however , monsieur hollande is eager to live up to his socialist promises , all the egalit\u00e9 he was voted for , and does not shrink the state but instead raises taxes further , lowers the pension age and raises minimum wages http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/07/us-france-budget-hollande-idusbre8860qh20120907 and one quote from hollande :  la d\u00e9pense publique atteint 57 % de la richesse nationale . 
  public spendings are now reaching 57 % of the gdp . 
  5 years ago it was 52 % . 
  are we better-off ? 
  there also is an increase in the vat ( which is paid more highly by the poor than the rich ) and some freezing ( like tax tiers or minimal wage that normally follow the inflation ), 
  and sparked a revolution . 
  because it is `` avoiding an exceptional effort in a time when the country faces exceptional difficulties and when everyone else contributes more '', 
  they also do that ( 60bn to be cut in the 2013 's budget ) . 
  actually welfare makes only [ ~ 40 % of it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_france ) ( in france ), 
  as i stated elsewhere , dodging a temporary 75 % marginal rate in a time were your country 's finances need it seems pretty unpatriotic to me . 
  does anyone really care if the calculation method gives a 150 % rate for revenues above 12.45 trillion ? 
  minable was addressed at the move . 
   `` i find it quite pathetic ( here is your minable ) , '' ayrault had said . 
  `` everyone loves him as an artist but paying your taxes is an act of solidarity and patriotism . '', 
  what is the stupid part ? 
  the `` everyone loves him as an artist '' , it is true he is a bit too vulgar for some . 
  a marginal 100 % tax rate would not be `` obviously too much '' . 
  if i use a mathematical ( continuous ) function instead of a tier system for example , i can arrive to a 100 % rate for an absurdly high income . 
  what insult ? 
  the only one i 've heard is `` egoist '' , which is arguably justified . 
  well my bad then . 
  do n't they keep it at home though ? 
  i 'd guess nobody really care if it is a gun you own or something lended to you .
