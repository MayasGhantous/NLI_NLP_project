  reservists do . 
   coincidentally , that is about ( 9.5 bn ) what [ 2 ] french farmers got from it in 2011 the 19 bn is the french contribution to the eu budget . 
  and as a matter of fact , the area of france is exactly 15.6 % of the eu ( 674,843 km2/4 ,324,782 km2 ) . 
  but a more interesting figure would be farmable land , which i will not fetch tonight . 
  you 've got your numbers wrong . 
  french farmers do not recieve 19bn but 9bn , that is 16 % of the total . 
  and yes , french arable lands do amount to about that figure ( i will read the rest later . ), 
  rubbish , the whole point of a patent is to make the information about innovation circulate and to develop innovation : in most countries the patent fees are halved if you are willing to grant anyone who asks a licence for using your invention . 
   why ? 
  all of the cost is in the lawyers who prepare the application , and they already only have to prepare it once . 
  patent inspectors do not inspect for free . 
  you seem to believe that it i free to patent something once you have written the patent . 
  that is not true , and it is quite expensive if you want to do it worldwide : when you file a patent in one country , you have to pay a fee every x years ( i believe the most common period is 5 years ) . 
  if you want the protection extended to another country , you have to also pay the fee in that country . 
  the proposal here is to have only one patent zone for the whole eu ( minus italy and spain ) , so only 1 fee to pay . 
  that only shows that the british patent office should not have granted that patent . 
  the legal requirement stating that a `` man of the art '' should be able to build the stuff by reading the patent is quite universal . 
  again : an example of a misapplicated law from 80 years ago tells nothing about whether the unifying of patent zones is a good thing or not . 
   no matter how you look at it , the cap is bad ok let 's go : * the very aim of agricultural policy : having your countryside cultivated ( and inhabited ) and be able to be self-reliant when it comes to food ( which is the most important product a country can have ) . 
  why is it necessary ? 
  because we want to overproduce so as to have a sufficient amount of food during a bad time . 
  the principle is certainly not `` bad no matter how you look at it '' . 
  and food shortage is not some fantasy from 60 years ago : look at north africa and , to a lower extent russia 2 or 3 ears ago . 
  of course overproduction means that you ca n't have a free market and you have to subsidise . 
  * you seem to be suggesting that france leeches on other countries . 
  let 's imagine the cap is removed tomorrow , and that everyone keeps paying the same share to the reduced eu budget . 
  in 2011 , cap 's cost [ has been 55 bn $ ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/2011/2011_en.cfm ) , on a 125 bn $ global budget , 19 bn have been paid by france . 
  if we were to completely remove the cap , france should the have to pay only 10.6 bn . 
  let 's round it down to 10 bn : france pays 0.8 bn for the uk rebate which would have no reason to exist . 
  so slashing the cap completely would mean +9 bn $ for france . 
  coincidentally , that is about ( 9.5 bn ) what [ french farmers got from it in 2011 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) . 
  france contributes to the cap . 
  so france is a net beneficiary from the cap , but only by 300-600 milion euros ( i do not have the most recent figures and i rounded my calculations ) . 
  also note that france 's share in payments is decreasing ( from the previous link , i have 2009 : 8.2 % 2010 : 8.0 % , 2011 ; 7.4 % ) . 
  edit : i should also point out that i used the eu total budget , not only the 108bn paid by member-states . 
  if i do so ( which is more correct : the custom income would not decrease if the cap was cut ) i find that france is a net contributor to the cap by 1 bn $ . 
  * on the wine point : wine is a perfectly legitimate agricultural product . 
  it represents [ ~ 5 % of the value of european agriculture ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-fk-11-001/en/ks-fk-11-001-en.pdf ) ( i believe eea , not eu ) , so 4 % of the subsidies seems about right . 
  * ( not really a debating point , more of a precisions ) poland , afaik has big interest in the cap as well . 
  remember the french payments are falling ? 
  it mostly goes to poland . 
   historically ___  before the advent of [ ... ],

  it will last for years , but at last we will be able to stop it ... and will be awarded a nobel peace prize for that . 
   and this had no effect on the romanian public . 
  nothing .

  well ... 
  same for everyone really . 
  have you forgotten the american cohabitation of the last 4 years ? 
   you did n't think we democratic types , who have been fighting you empire building types for millennia [ ... ] this is both very informed and really moving !,

  interesting research subject : is the outcome of anal sex digested ? 
  they are talking about a +20 % increase in the final price . 
  not that of a deterrent . 
  read the article before posting . 
  the moral justification is not `` germany attacked greece in wwii '' . 
  way to state the obvious ( hint : the parent post was a joke ),

  that carries , actually .

   typical arrogant western tourist who thinks whole turkey is sultanahmet , taksim or antalya . 
  maybe people are not like that in non-touristy parts of turkey but as a prospective tourist , why should i care ? 
  everywhere there is love and compassion , there is france . 
  there 's quite a difference between `` having taken spanish '' and `` speaking spanish '' though .

  it is not their role to enforce the greek constitution,

  not to all illegal immigrants , only to migrants from some countries , and that is mostly because there already is a community from those countries in the uk . 
  people tend not to migrate to places where they do not know anyone .

  people who downvote you are mean , it was quite funny . 
   a french court ruled a few years ago that indeed the spanish bourbons are now the legitimate heirs of the french kingdom since louis xiv did not have the right to separate the branches of the family . 
  take that , austria !, 
  what do you mean not allowing a debate ? 
  the debate seems pretty vivid to me . 
  passeport control lasted litteraly 15 seconds for me . 
   i suspect that the ump ( or whatever they are calling themselves now ) will make a big deal of this at the next election that was allready sarkozy 's theme when he was elected 8 years ago though . 
  we 're not really a germophobic country ( as long as alsace remains french ), 
  the eu is n't mentioned once in this article . 
   why open a factory plant in a poor country if you could open it in a rich country for the near the same cost . 
  because the salaries and the land are cheaper there ? 
  but again how does that change anothing ? 
  if all eu countries ( including ireland ) agree , that means that everyone is on board to change whatever binding agreement there can be . 
  if ireland disagrees , there can be no change , binding agreement or not . 
  are you sure the `` they '' you talk about is really the eu ? 
  because it does n't look like the eu commission to make such promises . 
  and if it is your government who said it they can block it . 
   but charlemagne was dutch . 
  and what is our president 's name ? 
  well obviously we are .
