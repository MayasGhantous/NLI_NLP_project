  yeah but it is `` madame thatcher '' iirc , you could replace that by `` theresa may '', 
    putin at the meeting with macron said that anna yaroslavna , established russia-france relations , saying that she was russian . 
  which probably does n't really translate well in french , since she is mostly known as anne de kiev here . 
   benedict of nursia , the saint of europe and refugees . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ probably, 
  that will sound like the usual joke but ... i really ca n't see the invisible part, 
  be careful : manuel valls is looking for a new job . 
  so ... no examination ? 
  he meant the * real * left of course . 
  the one which opposes macron . 
  i still do n't see the fuss about it . 
  it was essentially a soft cap on salaries , which seems like a reasonably acceptable idea . 
   i mean ww2 , when french sat on their asses behind their fortifications waiting for germans to come , despite the fact that their alliance treaty with poland clearly stated that they are supposed to launch a large scale offensive against germany within two weeks of poland being attacked , as well as such offensive being entirely possible as france had a huge numerical advantage over germany on the ( potential ) western front at the time , due to around 80 % of wehrmacht being concentrated on invasion of poland . 
  ok , france and the uk might have been able to defeat germany . 
  but then what ? 
  war with the ussr ? 
  sometimes a joke has no point ( like spain ), 
   if i remember correctly - france is still on heightened alert . 
  if i remember correctly , the us still have the patriot act . 
  would you say that the us has become unstable and under constant attack ? 
   there are people living there just do not want to accept french culture . 
  no more than in the uk . 
   years ago paris was an amazing dream destination to visit . 
  now people slightly question if it is even safe sometimes to go . 
  and as the attacks become more frequent - tourism will die down . 
  compared to 2015 you have lost 1.5 million tourists . 
  which is about the same as what london has seen after the 2005 attack there . 
  i feel like you are slightly misrepresentering how things are ( both in france and the uk ) . 
  you should probaby abstain from describing situations you know nothing about . 
   agreed . 
  i believe what led to brexit is the fear that the british will have their country overrun and will be like france one day . 
  what is france like ? 
  would n't that be because the us did not take measure to reduce their debt yet ? 
  one of its core duty is to harmonize regulations ( by regulating by itself ) . 
  a sunny day is a day when you can actually * see * the sun , not a day when the clouds are shiny . 
  that `` loss of sovereignty '' is more an effect of debt than eu membership . 
  look at all the imf-administered countries from these last decades . 
  there is the whole `` queue for 3 hours in front of the embassy '' part though . 
  on the other hand , can spain and italy really hope to get better rates if greece falls ? 
  i 'm not sure everything is taken into account here , especially mobility . 
  a child born in france/germany/italy can move to switzerland on the spot and without too much of a language barrier . 
  emirate citizens have a bunch of petrodollars handed to them by their government ( e.g. 
  foreign university fees + high allowance ) . 
  it does raise some opportunities . 
  the uk has island next to france ( and no i do not ean the big obvious one ) , nobody cares ( although they tend to be fiscal paradises ), 
  note grenoble/lyon as well . 
  you have to pay your staff , and many of said staff is in luxembourg . 
  this has nothing to do with cohesion fund . 
  that project is a better grid interconnection between members . 
  while it is true that the uk is unlikely to benefit from it ( having enough interconnection capacity to synchronise britain and the mainland would be too costly ) it is nonetheless something that is far more important today than 7 years ago . 
  and what is wrong with calling your prime minister president ? 
  a `` president of the council '' is a prime minister , why not a `` president of the commission '' ? 
  but this is another point entirely , which ought to be debated during the cap reform of 2013 ( for example , aiming the cap at trying to promote more efficient ways of farming in africa ( since the `` hungry farmer '' problem will not really be solved just by removing the cap ) ) what we have here is cameron seeking cuts and trying to have his way with the cap in that regard . 
  the nonsense is on both sides of the channel : if we assume that the rebate makes it so that the cap is cash-neutral for the uk then why is cameron pressing for a cut on the ground that `` the uk has no free money to hand out '' ? 
  i am doubtful that his prime concern is the competitivity of african agriculture . 
  as for getting back the money from the farmer , i 'm sure we can transfer a few taxmen from the mainland to the uk . 
  that is not `` most of '' , that is 25 % . 
  and the 4 billion rebate has to be brought to the debate : its justification is the cap . 
  let 's imagine we slash completely the cap which is so hard on britain : the uk loses its 3bn ( 2011 figure ) rebate and the 4bn ( 2009 ) it receives from the cap : ** -7 g $ ** but of course , they do not have to pay for it either : the eu budget is cut by 55 bn ( 2011 ) . 
  in 2011 , the uk paid for 13bn out of 108 , so 12 % . 
  if the cap is removed and the cut is spread according to this , the uk will have decrease its payment by ** +6.6 g $ ** . 
  in the end it appears that the uk does not lose money from the cap . 
  we use sex !, 
  where exactly do you see anyone claiming that ? 
  how does it makes money ( other that arianespace ) ? 
  schumpeterian destruction of lives is not something very popular . 
  have you noticed that the bank union will eventually be done , even if it might result in a compromise between parties ? 
  it actually makes a difference whether germany is isolated on that matter or most of the euro-core agrees . 
  they even made the missions retrun to earth !, 
  if your aim is to promote agriculture in the eu , does n't it make sense to spend the money in countries which have arable land ? 
  the share france currently gets is about its share of arable land ( 13 % , i believe ) and this percentage is continuously falling ( mostly to poland 's benefit ) . 
  the one who gets the house also gets the parents ( or one of the children move and take his parents with him ) . 
  well that is bad timing ( as the gov. 
  is in the middle of its `` reform spree '' ), 
   independently and the version that was subsequently used by the world was the greek one . 
  therefore saying our democracies ' birthplace is greece is correct . 
  so you are surprised to see french people go to the street to demonstrate ? 
   instead we should look at the german model [ ... ] then also make sure you look at its shortcomings too ( biggest one : can europe sustain 2 germany ? 
  ( and 2 big ones that time ) ), 
  he meant trade surplus/deficit . 
  you only sell when someone buys , and most deals are made inside the eu . 
   you 're never going to grow your way out of debt without exporting . 
  to whom ? 
   the ecb 's commitment to price stability seems more dogmatic than practical . 
  well that is what is asked of them . 
  the reasons for having it put that way in the maastricht treaty are up to debate , but not really important now . 
  i 'd say small investors ( so people who keep their stocks for a relatively long time ) do not really care about a 0.2 % tax either . 
   but i do remember the hard wage cuts and the drastically reduced welfare state after 2005 , which still has a lot of german workers working for very low wages ( especially compared to the other big economies in europe ) , the increased amount of temp workers , general loss of job security and benefits . 
  and that is exactly what the article blames germany for : unilaterally going from below-average competitivity to one which is too much above-average . 
  you just should not do that if you are supposed not to compete against other european countries but rather work with them ( and especially if you have a monetary union with said countries ) . 
  the eu economy is highly integrated so if germany runs a large trade surplus , of course it means that spain will run a trade deficit . 
  no technical problem , but an economic one : when you build something you like it to be active . 
  if those countries close the interconnectors germany will have nowhere to dump its excess . 
   we will probably be deported except in cayenne ( and we do not do that anymore ) france has not really anywhere to deport its citizens . 
  here , you can google translate this http://religion.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/04/13/islamophobie-augmentation-de-72-des-actes-visant-les-personnes-selon-une-association/, 
  france also have a system which favours bipartism and yet , while there are 2 big ones , other are able to exist and exert an influence . 
  if you look at the repartition over tge years , france 's share is declining and poland 's ( the big eastern farm ) rising . 
  and most countries in western europe also have successfully fended off most invasions ( which is the reason they are countries today ), 
  every country in europe spent the last thousand years rebuffing invasions from europe . 
  but this is more nato-like than a proper unified army .
