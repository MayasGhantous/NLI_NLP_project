  which means she both work and study . 
  the cost of the euaction part is indeed partially covered by the gov. 
  french here ... and they are quite popular , especially for pans ( if you are talking about the material inside ) . 
  that and a ceramic knife is something every wannabe cook has ( which accounts for quite a lot of persons ) . 
  european banks not being too audacious with loans these last few years . 
  now that 's news . 
  hyperinflation : the poor guys are not in the euro, 
  students is those schools are not exactly known to be working hard ( because  the students were learning difficult math very early in their studies , all the engineering afterwards comes quite easily ) . 
  what school were you in ? 
   ( there are already signs of a renewal of the classic struggle between the `` true '' left and `` treacherous '' social democrats ) [ it ] ( http://gauche.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/08/29/philippe-poutou-npa-la-politique-de-hollande-est-la-meme-que-celle-de-sarkozy/ ) seems [ to ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2012/08/29/cgt-thibault-alarme-de-la-situation-appelle-a-des-mobilisations-le-9-octobre_1752791_3234.html ) be more than [ signs ] ( http://gauche.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/08/25/pour-sa-rentree-melenchon-sallie-julian-assange-et-cible-hollande/ ), 
  yep , generally those kind of agreement are eu+s witzerland + norway, 
   so you can see that the eu is miles ahead of the us by being more unbiased towards the conflict . 
  no comment . 
  following up with today 's news : the greens seem to have won in term of pr . 
  they cried out their indignation to all the papers and seem to have managed to make pro-nuke a term of abuse . 
  now , maybe there will be some counter-answer in the papers tomorrow , but so far anti-nukes have won this battle . 
  [ this ? 
  ] ( http://cdn.walyou.com/wp-content/uploads//2011/10/kryptonite-candy.jpg ), 
  but asshole is a compliment : a useful member of the society , working in the shadows for the good of all . 
  in france it is for `` unprovoked affront '' ( not insult , note ) , and the max . 
  fine is 38 $ . 
  you probably wo n't have it for calling someone a `` trou du cul '' . 
  i guess you could argue that your aim was only to relieve your inner pressure , and that in no way you can hurt the person because he knows he is not an actual asshole . 
  ( it would be different , i guess , if you called someone overweight a `` fat disgusting repulsive obese '' ), 
  am i the only one to think that that kind of titling ( merkel , hollande instead of merkel and hollande ) makes it 10 times harder to read ? 
  the eu is supposed to be a common market after all . 
  borders have currently hard time being lifted for mobile , mainly because of the oligopoly that prevails in that sector . 
  i think it would be sounder to have a unique phone regulator , eu-wide operating licenses and wait for the newly-found concurrency to do its job ( the only problem would be how does it reflect on the coverage quotas ) . 
  a public network core would n't hurt either ( as they do in the electricity sector ), 
  true , i would love that if americans stopped to be so vibrant about their country and finally accept that europe is superior ( to them and to the rest of the world ) in every way !, 
  the french version is complete . 
  i 'll translate it tonight if i have time . 
  http://www.presseurop.eu/fr/content/article/265611-pourquoi-tant-de-haine edit : nevermind , found the text in english http://wes-dc.org/?p=119, 
  that 's silly , beethoven does not exist : it is an actor-dog playing it . 
  thanks . 
  when i read `` voice of the radical left '' i understood `` giving the same * born\u00e9 * discourse than the communists '' rather than `` the brain of activists '' . 
   we probably all know what a british article means by `` number 10 '' by now i freezed for a bit wondering what it was . 
  ( for those like me : 10 , downing st. ), 
  radical as in * radicale * or * parti radical * ? 
  in the first case , i 'd like some examples . 
   another tax aimed at high-frequency trading was also implemented . 
  the so-called frequency tax is 0.01 % on the amount of stock orders modified or cancelled that exceeds 80 % of all orders transmitted in a month . 
  in short , it 's more of a `` non-transaction '' tax . 
  the tenses are messed up , there is a * would * missing somewhere . 
  hf transactions are 90 % of the total transactions . 
  i want to curb it . 
  80 % of the transactions are now avoided , that was totally not the expected effect !, 
  except for the spiegel ( which is linked quite often ) , thorough analysis wo n't be on these website , and certainly not translated . 
   one of the problems of [ 3 ] / r/europe is without doubt the anglo-centric bias of the vast majority of the submissions . 
  using french and germans speaking media will help to give a wider view of europe . 
  the comment section will remain in english . 
  but why not simply translate the articles you need ? 
  if you want to post one , i 'd guess you understand the language . 
  and i also guess that the amount of people unable to write english is fairly low . 
  so why not just link to the article in the language you like and then translate it for everyone ? 
  it 's not like it is really long to translate journalist style anyway . 
  that 's good enough for me . 
  same :( the running joke of my last trip is now ruinned by reddit . 
  but i 'm still going to say that i have bits of slutties scattered around my round , probably enough to make one if i gather them , and maybe a bit more . 
  woosh . 
  polish zloty sounds a bit like polish slutty , which is amusing . 
  i can read that . 
  but what about the title ? 
  is it simply nonsensical or does it carry a deeper meaning ? 
  i understood that . 
  i meant a reference inside the book title . 
  a shame . 
  got ta love polish slutties . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i there a reference or something ? 
  you know all these zones are not a terrible place . 
  i 've lived in one ( maurepas , rennes ) , maybe people were a little poorer than the rest of the city ( and with a lot of council housing too ) , but it was definitely not isolated . 
  the biggest park of the city was there , as well as the ice skating arena . 
  the center ( remember that in most europe center = good & expensive housing ) was at 10 minutes by foot at most . 
  it was also quite small : a dozen blocks at most . 
  i do not feel that these zone are a great measurement of `` the parts of france where no one wants to live '' . 
  how so ? 
  i do n't really think this is a new thing http://www.crepegeorgette.com/2009/09/20/ca-sen-va-et-ca-revient/, 
  what do you remember about florence ? 
  its crippling debt ? 
  * the french surrendered to the muslim scum * see , everyone is happy now . 
   but what do his eating habits have to do with it, 
  i agree with the consequences . 
  but the cause is not an inherent racial exclusion , rather conformism, 
  maybe so . 
  but again , these jobs also have an unusually high presence of big-breasted blond women , this does not mean anything for an other type of job . 
  the fact that unstandard anchormen have trouble getting recognized is n't news . 
  jean-michel apathie had a lot of trouble because of his southern accent , that does n't mean there is a global discrimination against people from southern france ( except maybe against * les auvergnats * ) . 
  true but mcdonald was n't elected either . 
  what says something about both societies is that is did not in either case posed a problem to anyone ( or at least very few people ) . 
  on the other hand , if we are to talk about * first black doing that or this * , france nearly had a black president in 1962 ( had de gaulle died in the petit-clamart attack , which was a close shot - litteraly ) . 
   every kid was to be taught english from the moment they started in school . 
  that 's pretty much what happens . 
  the strasbourg-brussel thing is already a source of major annoyance , imagine what would happen if you had to replace the thalys by a plane . 
  fantomas strikes again !, 
  maybe brussels is a bit too western given the eastern expansion , but the alternative would be somewhere in germany , which is not really acceptable in term of balance of powers . 
  maybe vienna ( because it is a bit oversized for austria anyway ) or prague , for history 's sake . 
  the only problem i see with vienna is the shitload of un organization there is , but it is not too big of a drawback . 
  well it did n't work , i 've never heard about it either . 
  well i have,
