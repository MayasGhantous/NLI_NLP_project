   % of gdp, 
   petty bourgeois interests no , the bourgeois are from calais , that 's a bit more western . 
  ... sorry , french history-nerd joke . 
  full translation ( my financial english is not as good as it should be , extrapolate if needed ) :  everyone seems to focus on the german bill for the two last greece bailout plans . 
  germany is indeed the highest contributor of the eurozone and accounts for 29 % of those plans , having spent 46 billion euros , with another 21 billions to go . 
   but everyone also seems to forget that the greek crisis caused a general distrust towards the eurozone which resulted in a trend of `` fly to quality '' : high demand of german debt . 
  as a result germany can borrow money at a rate of 0 % . 
  even more the two-years bond rate on the secondary market is ( in the beginning of june ) negative , meaning investors accept to lose money so as to secure their capital , as if they were renting a safe in a bank . 
   an approximative * calculation shows that , thanks to this , germany earned 63 billion euros in three years . 
  6-years bonds ' rates - the most common - have indeed shrank from 2.6 % in 2009 to 0.95 % in 2012 . 
  germany has already cashed back its greek investment . 
   according to the same calculations france - whose 6-years bonds ' rate have gone from 2.91 % in 2009 to 1.97 % this year - has earned back 80 % of what it lent to greece : 38 billions in * vs * 48 out ( of which 33 billions have already been paid ) . 
   nevertheless , germany and france are not only helping greece , but also ireland , portugal , and soon , through the european financial stability facility , spanish banks . 
   * hypothesis : 2200 billion euros of debt pool for germany , 2000 for france , renewed every 6 years . 
  tl ; dr : what germany lent to greece , it earned it back with lower debt rates ( which are caused by people wanting to secure their money out of greece into germany ) . 
  do actual canadians trvel with canandian flag patches or is it only a us thing ? 
  ( s ) he obviously understood it as * romagna * , 
  probably to some extent : we have seen what it 's like to have a pm opposed to the president , and it sucks . 
   just a matter of time until the specialized police force is equated with the ss and persecution . 
  too late , there is already a french police corps identified with ss :[ riot police ] ( http://www.linternaute.com/actualite/magazine/photo/mai-68-sous-les-paves-les-crs/image/crs-ss-difficile-a-avaler-289122.jpg ),

   an other one was to affirm , against every bit of knowledge in polsci and constitutional law , that a state could be at the same time jewish and a democracy . 
  i might lack of knowledge in jewish canon law , but i do n't see the relation, 
   not denmark if they have a referendum . 
  were n't the polls indicating that it would be a yes some time ago ? 
  ( well , i guess it was ... before ), 
  if the firm is fully owned by the state , then the minister for economics will just send a letter . 
  if it is owned in majority , they will have to organize a general assembly and they are sure to get this done . 
  if the state is a minor shareholder its representatives will issue a motion during the general assembly which would then be voted . 
  it is also interesting to see that this decision can only apply to ceos who are `` mandataires sociaux '' ( basically have the status of shareholders ' representative ) . 
  if they are regular employees , under french labour law , their pay can not be lowered . 
  which was ( of course ) not on the `` you should n't hire him , because he is black '' but `` you should n't hire him because he is black '', 
  or they could actually live their within : introspecting and stuff . 
  ( thruhiker is gw bush 's nickname ), 
  i do n't get why germany is n't trying to use this to enhance european scrutiny over states budgets . 
  i would understand such a stance if it was coming from the uk or nortern europe , but germany has everything to gain and only need to pay a bit for for its money for that . 
  united in diversity . 
  i have hard time figuring out an event in the last 4 years when the eu did what the us wanted regardless of their interest . 
  that was of course ironic . 
  fact is going to from paris to london nowadays is far less of a change than from paris to the mediterranean coast . 
  and i can perfectly imagine why someone would leave paris and arrive on the mediterranean coast with little idea of what they are doing here . 
  you do not burn your vessels when you come to london . 
  ( i do n't think this is the case for the people described in the article ( basically , poor ones ) but paris and london are more and more forming one city . 
  i have absolutely no problem going to london for the day : it takes only twice the time it takes to ride from one side of paris to the other and i would do the former as often of the latter if it were not for the cost ), 
   recently the french consulate commissioned a report called the forgotten people of st pancras . 
  it focuses on the young french who arrive in london on a one-way ticket and sometimes find themselves in desperate straits . 
  it is a major problem . 
  they gave away all they had to pay their 45 $ for the train ride and now that they have realised that life is not rose they just ca n't go back . 
  in 50 years time they will have bought a big house in p\u00e9rigord and will live their within the english colony .

  what about abba ? 
  well in the chick-singing-with-vocal-effects sort of way , italia ( the one after us ) was better with their amy winehouse-clone .

  original : the guard dies but does not surrender . 
  mine : greeks : lagarde bites them but they do not give back these senteces have absolutely no link apart from sounding the same . 
  but i like bad puns a lot .

  use them well !, 
  ( interestingly enough , the original sentence was `` the guard dies but does not surrender '' ), 
  ( i give four internets to the non-french speaker who can guess what this sentence refers to . 
  i 'm quite proud of it ), 
  you may breed mad cows , but you 're correct . 
   a bunch of guys in tights chasing and trying to grab each other ftfy, 
   famous french compromise on the cap [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_rebate )  eu gambling laws and british beef imports [ yeah everyone makes concessions and it equilibrates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china%e2%80%93european_union_relations#arms_embargo ) ( sea , i have even put an exemple where uk and france go along ), 
   are you seriously trying to equate the amount of tax money an ftt would produce in france to how much it would produce in the uk ? 
  no , i 'm trying to understand why you jump down my throat for general frenchness . 
   again , you must think we 're collectively fucking stupid to agree to this have you ever heard of compromises and compensations ? 
  that 's what reasonable people do when they disagree . 
   meanwhile in the uk we already work longer hours than you , retire later ( and the retirement age is steadily increasing ) and generally enjoy fewer services than the french you want a medal for that ? 
   yet you describe the uk giving up an extra # 20 billion of our own tax monies , despite shouldering all the risk in the endeavour , as the uk coming out a winner ? 
  you must think the british are fucking stupid . 
  may i point out that france would also give out money if such a scheme were to be set up ? 
  and that what i said is that if , thanks to eu ( because it is a certitude that , should uk do it alone , it would lose most of its trade ) uk is able to levy 7 billion euro of tax without shrinking its financial activity it will be a win for it . 
  therefore it is more a bet on whether traders will flee to other marketplaces than `` should uk contribute more '' . 
  if they relocalize , that 's a loss . 
  if they do n't everyone wins : uk gets 7.7 g $ and the eu something like 25g $ ( uk + other countries net new contribution ) . 
  pus hf trading gets to be regulated ( assuming those 57 g $ revenue take into account the fact that some trades might not be profitable anymore ) but i agree uk would take most of the risk, 
  as i read your link what is given under the name of ftt is rebated off eu contribution . 
  of course it is , why do you think those countries are trying to convince uk ? 
   i really doubt they will join with the current congress majority , fat chance indeed . 
  and do n't know enough about us politics to try predicting what the next house will look like . 
   firstly [ ... ] fair enough . 
  is their a secondly ? 
  ( not about what one mep says , but what is likely to happpen ), 
  you are getting upset all by yourself . 
  the only reason some want it to be a european-wide taxation is to avoid having everyone going to trade to the untaxed place ( and they hope/believe that the eu is too big to be avoided ( especially if the us join ) ) . 
  but nobody said anything about giving this money to the eu ( you know they ca n't levy taxes , right ), 
  how could new earnings help with disbalanced budgets ? 
  because so many europeans speak english . 
  had n't this been made 140 years ago already ? 
  minor thing but as a french i 'm always striked to read things such as  just look at the gains made by marine le pen 's national front in france and golden dawn in greece . 
  far right in france has been making about the same score ( 20 % ) at presidential elections for 20 years , with an exception in 2007 due to the 2002 surprise ( le pen qualified for the second turn ) . 
  are journalists so in need for a global pattern all over europe ? 
  well he never said anything suggesting the opposite . 
  the iea ( institute of economic affairs ) . 
  i was wondering what the iaea had to do with all this .
