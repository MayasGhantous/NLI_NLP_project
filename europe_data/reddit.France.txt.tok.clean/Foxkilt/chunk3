  you 've got oil and soap operas . 
  it checks out . 
     it 's funny , because thats exactly what the british people were told it was about . 
  it was going to be purely economic , with very little loss of sovereignty or political integration . 
  hence his sentence `` britain has joined based on a misunderstanding '' . 
   he cap is pretty much france taking back only a portion of the money it gives to the eu . 
  that 's why french farmers tend to be quite anti-eu because they feel they 'd get more if it were n't for the eu . 
  if the cap was scrapped today and replaced by equal national schemes , france would end up paying approximately the same thing ( in other words , france is cap-neutral in term of contribution/benefit ), 
   however lyon ... is one ugly motherfucking city . 
  the eastern part is not very nice , but the western one ( west of the rh\u00f4ne ) looks good . 
   it 's like the local government has decided to spend everything on central and ignore the suburbs completely . 
  it 's not the same local government , so pretty much . 
  for nothing , it is affected to the following year in `` other revenue '' . 
  additionally `` diet '' comes from the latin * dies * , so it 's only a latin translation of the suffix '' - tag '' . 
  and in fact the fist diet was the imperial diet , in german the reichstag . 
  but the political project is the direct consequence of the single market project . 
  or would you rather have the necessary common regulations decided upon by a bunch of unelected bureaucrats ? 
  the schengen treaty means that there is no border control . 
  another rule of the eu is the free circulation of goods and ** workers ** , which means that romanians can come work in the uk if the want ( only , since the uk does not partake in schengen , they will have to show some id at the border ) . 
  i 've never heard of such a rule . 
  [ if you speak french ] ( http://fresques.ina.fr/de-gaulle/fiche-media/gaulle00085/conference-de-presse-du-14-janvier-1963-sur-l-entree-de-la-grande-bretagne-dans-la-cee.html ) ( starts at 33:10 ) , it 's a bit too late for me to translate  l\u00e0-dessus , la grande-bretagne a pos\u00e9 sa candidature au march\u00e9 commun . 
  cette question-l\u00e0 c'est toute la question . 
  roughly : the uk 's economic system relies on exchanges with the commonwealth and the us , which is incompatible with a common market in europe . 
  it 's simple really . 
  the 14.7 g $ figure ( bottom right ) includes duties on top of the direct contribution of 12.1 g $ , which itself includes a 2.6 g $ payment based on vat collected in the country , a 13 g $ payment based on the country 's gni and a 3.5 g $ rebate : 13 +2.6 -3.5 = 12.1 . 
   left wing , liberal policy from the eu . 
  the eu has been dominated by the conservative for a few years now . 
  yes of course , that was just for exactitude 's sake . 
   their net contributions are roughly equivalent . 
  [ not quite ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/270o6i/why_do_the_britains_want_to_leave_the_eu/chwrcv3 ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/tpfktjc ) is a screenshot from the 2010 tab of the budget excel file ( first column is the whole eu , second is the uk ) as you can see , the guardian is right about its figures . 
  i noticed in [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/270o6i/why_do_the_britains_want_to_leave_the_eu/ ) other thread how people generally lacked sources when talking about the eu budget . 
  that file ( and the associated charts ) is a great source that i thought i would share . 
  that infographics might not be the best . 
  since it was published in the beginning of 2012 , it 's understandable that the guardian would use the 2010 budget , but for some reason eu budgets are fairly [ variable year-to-year ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) ( select `` operating budgetary balance '' instead of `` expenditure '' ) . 
  in 2011 , it has been the 4th net contributor ( 5.6 g $ ) , in 2012 3rd ( 7.4 g $ ) , in 2009 the 4th ( 1.9 g $ ) , way behind italy , in 2008 the 6th ( 844 m $ ) and in 2007 the 2nd ( 4.1 g $ ) . 
  over the 2007-2012 period , the uk has been the 4th net contributor ( 25.46 g $ ) behind italy ( 26.70 g $ ) , france ( 32.95 g $ ) and germany ( 52.72 g $ ) . 
  actually no . 
  if you go look at the source ( [ ec 's figures ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) ) the rebate is already deduced in the 12.1 g $ contribution . 
  and that 's the only thing he needs ( being born and raised in france certainly helps ) . 
  words have more meanings than their literal ones . 
  alternatively , you can point at estonia celebrating the soldiers who fought the soviets under a nazi uniform . 
  iirc , that guy stopped for a while in malaysia on his way back and then landed in germany before going to belgium . 
  intelligence agencies probably did n't pick up on him soon enough . 
  so who should decide on the common regulations needed to have a true common market ? 
  unelected bureaucrats ? 
   the uk , comprising over 10 % of the eu population , has no representation in the governing party of the eu . 
  i 'm guessing the tories are welcome to join the governing coallition . 
  '' we put a * half * - space . 
  what for ? 
  it 's not like they hope to achieve something in parliament . 
   to the dismay of guardians of the french language where in the article is that dismay expressed ? 
  i see only two stories , unrelated to one another . 
   investor state dispute settlements part of the agreement well it 's not part of the agreement yet . 
  the parliament has authorized the negociators to talk about it . 
  i do n't mean to imply in any way that all brits are lying crooked mouths who would twist any kind of figure to appear better than the french , but the [ source article ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-is-worlds-top-attraction-for-tourists-9337343.html ) says that we are comparing london 's figures for 2013 with paris ' ones for 2012 , 2013 having been a `` global bumper year for tourism '' . 
  french immigrants do n't speak french as a second language . 
  brussels is ( very ) roughly at the [ center of the eu ] ( http://imgur.com/yck6azd ) ( even though aalborg could be a better choice ), 
  it 's actually illegal in france to introduce yourself as `` doctor x '' if you have n't a md. 
  not in france you ca n't . 
   so if france is less dependant of russian gaz than other eu countries , they still need it . 
  actually , the main reason why we less dependent on russian gas is that we import algerian gas . 
   it hurts nobody to be bilingual with a native language but why does it have to be english , among all languages ; _ ;, 
  total weight is a better measurement . 
  but in this particular crisis , all the nations more or less agreed . 
  in that case , the eu did n't react strongly not because it was divided , but because russia has leverage on it ( and because there was n't much to be done ), 
   all it takes is one strong commission president and one denial to set a precedent that will fuck you for decades . 
  then if the parliament is really pissed at this breach of standard practice , it can impeach the commission . 
  the french have never been really united , so technically it 's true . 
  this is a bit surprising though : i 'd have expected grenoble or nice to appear . 
  same for paris with yvelines and ( espcially ) hauts de seine ( where la d\u00e9fense , the business district seats ), 
  i 've heard an even more elaborate story ( and probably even more bullshit ) : the french would cut of captured bowmens ' indexes ( so that they ca n't shoot anymore ) . 
  so english soldiers would taunt the french by showing they still had their fingers , and french soldiers would raise only the medium finger , to show the english what expected them . 
  but is n't it a bit too early ? 
  having a common mobile phone market without a common frequency regulator ( ie : carriers operating in one country are not automatically authorized to operate in another ) does n't seem right . 
  because he does n't have the support of the people who usually support his party . 
  presidents are generally unpopular ( it is very rare for them to have an approval rate over 50 % ) but here he is trying to implement some austerity and pro-business policies while being in the socialist party . 
  that means he is unpopular both to the right-wing voters ( both because of his party , and because of some left-wing policy he implemented ) and to left-wing voters ( because austerity ) . 
  add to that the fact that he had to raise taxes ( nobody likes that ) and that he does n't have much charisma ( which is probably one of the most determining factors , the rest being confirmation bias ) and you 're good for an abysmal popularity . 
  the tricky part is that this change of pm is unlikely to change anything : valls is label as `` sarkozy-bis '' by a large part of the left-wing , and the right-wing will never support someone from the ps . 
  several factors i think : * it was one of the most important cities in the hre ( and has been one of its capitals for quite a long time ) . 
  * contrary to many imperial cities , prague was also the capital of a kingdom * and it has stayed a european capital all these mean that the city can be thought as vienna , but with an earlier golden age . 
  it was the third most populous city of europe during the late middle-age . 
   it was more or less abandonned rather less than more , since the tax is active right now, 
  in france ? 
  all parties seem to be playing at who will be the most dirigist, 
  is n't that what everyone selling weapons does anyway ? 
  i fail to see how they can amend a treaty without having their executive renegociate it . 
  in any case i do n't really see how the parliament could amend treaties between sovereign nations : it is those very treaties that give it its existence and power . 
  ( and i 'm sure the uk parliament can only ratify or reject treaties , not amend them ), 
  it 's almost as if two interdependent neighbors ( and allies ) have the same basic interests to defend . 
  i 'm not sure there are a lot of factory in the immediate proximity of paris . 
  are n't most power sockets intercompatible throughout the eu ( safe for the uk , but if you try to change it they will get mad and repeat things like `` fuses in the plughead '' over and over again ), 
  i 'm not sure that 's very good for the battery , plus you could end up in a situation where you are discharging the battery if you use your laptop while it 's charging . 
  thankfully ? 
  you want all french people buried in lava , do n't you ? 
  the european one ? 
  and more specifically the barroso commission . 
  but that 's a problem with this commission , not the eu , is it ? 
  well of course : they maliciously destroyed a us army missile , costing dozens of thousands of dollar .
