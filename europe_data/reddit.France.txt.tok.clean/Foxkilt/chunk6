  denmark , italy , finland or ireland were net recipients in 2000 . 
   and send cap back to the countries . 
  so much for the `` common '' , then . 
   but we also have countries with a little gov doing well i have absolutely no clue but is german government really that small ? 
  even if you take the landern 's governments into account ? 
   french administration is a shithole for sure that 's not even true . 
  it 's okish , and is getting better now that you can use the internet . 
  2/3 of the budget goes to that because it is the only big budget that the eu hanldes . 
  if there was a european army ( random example ) , i can assure you that this ratio would be much lower . 
  but would n't these stats also show mainlanders going to hong-kong etc. . ? 
  we are probably in the top countries for french proficiency . 
  is n't that enough ? 
   so , a council that is completely without accountability to anyone except a bunch of lapdogs and egomaniacs chose him ( although this could be said for most parliaments ) ? 
  great . 
  the people in that council are the head of state/government of member states . 
  they are accountable to their people . 
   as to why the countries who want access to such capabilities without paying for it are in favour of the idea of an integrated military you will find that the french and the brits ( and to a lesser extent , the italians ) are the only ones interested in a european army . 
  what are those countries you are talking about ? 
   my problem is that i always got the idea that , rather than functioning with a parliament from which the cabinet ( the ec if you will ) is drawn , the ec is not drawn from the parliament and the ep is just lip-service to the idea of democratically accountable leadership . 
  the french government works this way too : the head of state picks ministers which the parliament can revoke . 
  i do n't really think that france is a less democratic country than the uk ( especially since your pm can appoint peers anyway ) . 
  starting a business is actually [ very easy ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20130830/its-easier-to-start-a-business-in-france-than-elsewhere ) in france . 
  now make it grow can be tricky ( both because of employee-protecting regulations when you hire a lot of them and because big companies have awful business practices ), 
  well yes , that is part of what it means . 
  as i said , no hypocrisy . 
  that war was always about `` we want that region to be stable because we have interests in it '' . 
  no hypocrisy there . 
  yeah , but that kind of exclude the `` reasonably priced '' part . 
  i guess what was meant is that they have no specific advantage * in the ev world * . 
  there are other companies who make electric cars . 
   the commission is not a government . 
  it has the near-exclusive right to propose new legislation , to be approved by both the council of ministers ( representing governments ) and the ep . 
  but it is also a civil service , policeman of the single market and competition watchdog . 
  that looks a lot like a government to me . 
   president francois hollande said simplifying rules meant different things to different people i think that is the gist of it : over here the eu ( and especially the commission , and especially barosso ) is mostly seen as a ultra-liberal deregulating body . 
  it seems that elsewhere they view it as some sort of bureaucratic paralyzing force . 
  it happens in france remember . 
  in paris alone , there are about 10 demonstrations a day . 
  if on top of that you consider that ditching class for a day to demonstrate for a feel-good cause is something obviously appealing to students , it is no wonder why they do it . 
  there are student unions , but they have no real power , they are just here as a front figure . 
  and how are we supposed to kill foreign royals now ? 
  not for the guy who has to spend 30 minutes in traffic to circle paris and then one hour in a train to get there . 
  france did though . 
  france is eternal . 
  hurray !, 
  now we will be able to invade countries without renting antonovs or c-130 . 
  [ lier .

  the [ full quote ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/proche-orient/article/2013/09/02/la-volte-face-d-obama-temoigne-d-un-grand-mepris-pour-la-france_3469762_3218.html ) is :  la volte-face du pr\u00e9sident obama t\u00e9moigne d'un grand m\u00e9pris des etats-unis pour la france . 
  ( obama 's u-turn reflects great contempt for france . 
  the day before , hollande wrote in le monde why france would be going to syria . 
  the day after , his ally puts him in an impasse . ), 
  the contempt part is not to have warned the french gov of their intentions earlier . 
  that 's generally what allies do . 
  austrian food , that 's why . 
  but we have [ those ] ( http://www.monputeaux.com/images/2007/07/01/affiche20071web_2.jpg ) . 
  that 's the reason for the 3 % deficit rule : it is supposed to more or less be the deficit level where the debt is shrinking ( taking into account growth and inflation ) . 
  so to answer your question : for the debt to go below 60 % , the deficit first must shrink . 
  well yes . 
  the deficit is shrinking , but still positive . 
  actually sapin ( minister of labour , one of hollande 's men in the governement ) [ said ] ( http://www.europe1.fr/politique/chomage-sapin-n-avait-pas-vu-ca-depuis-plus-de-deux-ans-1653567/ ) `` let 's wait and see , it might be seasonal variations or only noise '' . 
   most of them are able to speak english i 'd bet that the amount of french mep capable of having a simple conversation in english is n't higher than 30 . 
  are n't you just paraphrasing the article ? 
   this bs again , we get to set our own tax-policies and that 's exactly what we do . 
  and that is exactly what a tax-heaven does as well . 
  and how many times a day do you deal with public servants ? 
  it is probably far too low to incentise anything . 
  and +0.5 % for france in the same quarter . 
  [ and here is the mail ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bs8pkzacuaatslm.jpg ) ( yes you 've read correctly : 20 % off at debenhams ! ), 
   still as raunchy as ever show us on the doll . 
  not closest , `` one of the closest '' . 
  the slap in the face is the fact that he did n't mention britain , not the fact that he talked about france . 
  english breakfeast is ( also ) a blend of tea . 
  but from now on , the tea will be labeled `` freedom breakfeast '' . 
  in france `` se fiancer '' means having a betrothal ceremony , which is i guess why people say `` people do n't do that anymore '' . 
   it was summer and the wedding season is spring . 
  \u00c0 nos amis fran\u00e7ais : `` get engaged '' \u2260 se fiancer . 
  why do you think there were protest ? 
  people are terrified to wake up one day only to discover they are now married to their butcher . 
  to be honnest i would n't be surprised if the official rules were basically the same in germany and france , only not really enforced in france . 
  how likely are people who do n't admit it to enter a same-sex marriage ? 
  so does/is a french marriage as far as the state is concerned . 
  so adoption by gay * married * couples . 
  so we 're talking about numbers even lower . 
  i 'm not sure whether it 's a joke or a lie, 
  want to meet the perfect people ? 
  you 're * always * invited by someone . 
  that would be the internet . 
  the www is something that runs on the internet, 
  we had our own germano-sovietic pact ? 
  so cute, 
  i have the weird urge to test the association of marmite and roquefort right now . 
  luckily i don `` t have either at home right now , but i hope it will be gone tomorrow morning, 
   oh , i expected better from a frenchman . 
  better than gratuitous wittish slander ? 
   scuttling meant that they could forever paint the british in a bad light that 's an awfully british way to think !, 
  yeah but that was a relatively small loss compared to the scuttling of toulon . 
  yeah and the two times of our history when we commited to build a superior fleet ( before the revolution , and before ww2 ) it was destroyed by its own sailors before being put to good brit-sinking use . 
  to be fair the main reason why france let go of north america was to keep its caribbeans territories because they were far more profitable economically speaking : sugar, 
   some people in south east england get their water from a french utility company ( via the chunnel ) cause it 's cheaper .
