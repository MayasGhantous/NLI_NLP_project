  either his program works really well and france actually enters a period of growth , and those voters will be silenced , or it does n't and that 's an unmitigated disaster with many people voting for le pen in protest . 
  juppe seems safer in a way to me ( that might be part of the `` weak president '' you are writing about ) . 
  i think it 's mostly because not many here are native speakers , and the connotation of leftist is a bit lost in translation . 
  you 're clearly dead-set on painting him eurosceptic , if you read the linked page you would see that he is very clearly in favor of giving the eu more power . 
  i think that answering most populists doubts about immigration is necessary for the eu to survive and not to fall prey to the far right . 
  i am personally a federalist , but i know that there is zero chance for it to be possible right now . 
  many things have to be changed before this kind of subject is even on the table . 
  among these things are a fiscal union , a common defense , a clear common policy regarding the euro . 
  he is advocating for all three . 
  he is very clearly pro-eu , he goes as far as a right wing politician can realistically go these days . 
  i agree . 
  he is not federalist , but he is clearly pro-eu . 
  juppe is indeed more europhile . 
  fillon is not against the eu per se ( a big part of his program is to harmonize the level of regulation in france with the eu , which will effectively make it easier for companies in other eu countries to sell their products in france : it 's pretty pro-eu ) , actually it 's the first time i saw people saying that he was not too fond of it . 
  he is extremely liberal ( in the ~ ~ american ~ ~ french sense ) , so for him the eu is a push in the right direction . 
  juppe is less radical concerning liberalization , even though he makes no secret that he will push his luck as far as possible , after the latest labor law that was already a push to the right ( even if introduced by a leftist government ) . 
  he is also against public spending , except in defense , and for reducing charges on the private sector . 
  he is just less extreme in his program . 
  nothing lead me to think that , why do you think so ? 
  edit : ok nevermind , i searched it . 
  he is pretty pro russian , and i never really followed his position on this matter . 
  i 'll have to read some more given his real chance to run for president . 
  france is leaning to the left socially if we compare it to the eu or the usa , so i 'm not sure how i should answer that . 
  he is pretty conservative , given for example his willingness to repell the 35h and delay the retirement age . 
  however many social safety nets in france are considered to be an integral part of our functioning and the right knows it is impossible for them to attack them , so france will always stay pretty heavy on the social side . 
  he is very liberal ( in the european sense of the term ) as far as the political spectrum goes in france . 
  given the zeitgeist these days , that will not make him very popular with the general population . 
  fillon is pretty close to sarkozy , program-wise . 
  he is more to the right than jupp\u00e9 . 
  he is liberal , ~ ~ pro-europe ~ ~ not against the eu , and is christian , which makes him pretty popular for the christian voters ( which is part of the electoral basis of the fn , so that 's good ) . 
  his main points are : reducing overall public spending , lowering taxes for companies and the middle-class , ending the 35h , removing the isf ( a special taxe bracket meant for the rich ) , setting the retirement age back to 65 yo , removing additional french regulations on top of the european ones , increasing defense spending ( emphasis on nuclear deterrence and update of the french military equipment ) . 
  i do n't know how he thinks he can lower taxes and charges on the private sector while increasing defense spending . 
  it means that he will probably cut ** a lot ** of positions in education , which is bad imo . 
  on the other hand , defense is a big research contractor so as far as france is concerned , that makes sense . 
  overall , for europeans it will mean that the position of france will not change if fillon is elected . 
  he will make defense a priority and is willing to harmonize the french regulations with the eu . 
  i think that this politic would probably make the ranks of fn voters grow in the medium term , in 8-10 years . 
  overall it will not be an apocalypse however . 
  edit : ah sorry , i misread you and thought that you were asking for his views . 
  i do n't really know how he is viewed in france , i am from a leftist environment and i never really interact with his voters . 
  and you should probably keep in mind that the medias are pretty badly informed about him , as demonstrated today by his surprising results . 
  he was prime minister under sarkozy , but has been successful in detaching himself from his legacy . 
  he is not viewed as too fond of sarkozy and is not really associated with him in the public eye i think . 
  he is also the only one that has n't been on the wrong end of a judge desk . 
  i 'm so fucking happy about it . 
  le pen has virtually no chance to win the presidential elections , this fucker is so humiliated he will probably not do politics anymore , and it will make him much easier to prosecute . 
  this is truly a great news , i will open a bottle to that tonight !, 
  we would only have to upgrade the existing facilities , that would be nice !, 
  i agree that it would probably be better to let another willing city do it , but overall i think this candidacy makes sense and i 'd be happy if the bid was won . 
  the most centrist among the candidates for the right , if you prefer . 
  you should look more carefully at what happened today then . 
  sarkozy has been eliminated . 
  it is the big surprise of the day , only one poll yesterday showed signs of fillon , the big winner , to actually head the primary . 
  sarkozy was the only chance of mlp to win the presidential elections , as for many on the left her or sarkozy represent pretty much the same thing . 
  she lost that chance today . 
  hollande will also probably drop the ball as he was waiting to see if sarkozy was running , as he is the only one hated enough for hollande not to ridicule himself thoroughly . 
  it is a so , so relieving to see this . 
  i was mostly fearing to see sarkozy winning the primary , him being eliminated in the first round is not only good for the country , it is also a big humiliation for him and will probably make him renounce politics for a few years , if he even comes back . 
  it will also make him much easier to prosecute . 
  i 'm elated . 
  if you go this way , any liberal capitalist is also a marxist as his actions could be explained in the marxist framework . 
  democratic socialism is primarily inspired from keynesianism , and is pretty much par for the course in europe . 
  i think you vastly overestimate the number of people in europe holding such views . 
  newspeak will only get you so far . 
  i know , and i agree for the adults . 
  still , i 'd prefer that being french meant something and that if someone was fucked by life we looked after each other . 
  if i was 14 or 15 and started to learn about the fucked up shit my parents did when i was young , and learnt that my country did everything it could to get me back , then it would mean a lot . 
  a few are children born to islamist parents . 
  we should not let them die in iraqi cells . 
  the article states that there was 700 french islamists abroad , of which 271 came back . 
  so i guess there is already an effort not to let them in . 
  also , among those 700 there are children , who are french , some of whom were born during the conflict in syria , some others lived in france for a few years and were brought there by their parents . 
  there has been a few articles about such families in french a few weeks back , right after the battle of mosul . 
  the situation is not all that simple . 
  it is already a thing . 
  it powers the vast majority of computing devices on the planet and has the largest hardware support of any existing os . 
  it is just not a desktop os . 
  yeah , i really liked blanche 's song . 
  however , i think the eurovision version really does it a disservice . 
  here is another version that i find better : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=johbxczbzfg this seems to not be a eurovision song , i hope it can be known otherwise . 
  je m ` attends par exemple \u00e0 ce qu'il rivalise hollande en terme d'impopularit\u00e9 . 
  proud to be french , and proud that macron is our president . 
  it will be a great 10 years . 
  that , and the debate on the third that showed how incompetent and stupid she was . 
  ah , and also her program , which is a litany of the dumbest possible things to do in our position . 
  not fascist ? 
  like trump , she attacks our institutions . 
  she slander our journalists , our judges , our teachers . 
  this is the same as erdogan , though she is not yet in power . 
  but in the places where the fn is in power , they use everything they can to control the local medias . 
  them in the presidency is indeed very concerning for democracy , and it ** is ** absolutely the pathway to fascism . 
  abandoning the core principles that makes our democracy work . 
  this is not political illiteracy , far from it . 
  this is recognizing how history is repeating itself . 
   anyone right of centre le pen is not just right of centre . 
   how can you possibly think macron is the superior choice here ? 
  easy , you look at his program and see things that makes sense . 
  then you listen to le pen speak and you mourn the death of your fucking synapses . 
  the fn is a brain disease , like the_donald and trumpism . 
  one question : if that guy was so hell bent on money and being a `` banker '' , why would he leave this life to gamble his career as a counselor to the president ?
