  negotiating deals is kind of expected . 
  negotiations of 9 months for a $ 3.5 b deal is absolutely not too long . 
  there is something else behind it . 
   making political scenes is pathetic making a political statement is absolutely required . 
  postponing a visit is nothing hysterical , do n't get your panties twisted like that . 
  scrapping a $ 3.5 b deal abruptly , cutting loose any trust built previously to get back in bed with an old master is pathetic , however . 
  that 's what poland want for europe , to keep being divided in between russia and the usa ? 
  that 's their project for the eu ? 
  pis is really a party of shortsighted morons . 
  they are a cancer for poland . 
  yeah , better to buy from the us , that 's really much better for european economy . 
  great move . 
  the article you linked tells nothing of france not wanting to honor the offset deal . 
  it pretty much says :  following the confirmation by poland 's defense minister that his country was breaking off offset negotiations with airbus helicopters which mean poland was breaking off the offset deal negociations . 
  it does not present anything more than op article . 
   for poland russia is big threat and is important for us to not show weakness against them the best way for poland not to show weakness is to forgo deals with its most natural allies , the rest of the eu ? 
  that 's the kind of diplomacy you want to oppose to russia ? 
  good job !, 
   happy to get almost nothing in return . 
  poland gets nothing from eu ? 
  what the fuck are you on about . 
   the eu development funds are being cut 25 % next year btw , just so you know . 
  so is it about 25 % of nothing that you are ranting ? 
  all member states agreed to this budget . 
  cohesion spending is down 23 % , security up 24 % . 
  is n't that what eastern euros are mostly about ? 
  were n't they the most worried about migrants and russia ? 
  so what the fuck ? 
  that 'd be swell indeed !, 
  my point is that both side are publishing propaganda ( i.e. 
  `` kool-aid ... ... narrative '' ) . 
  how anyone can distribute good points is beyond me . 
  that 's pretty stupid . 
  let 's say a party has a completely over-the-top demand , and the other one refuses . 
  which one is to blame ? 
  the one who pushed too far or the others for not bending over ? 
  and i said a `` party '' because both side made extreme propositions without real incentives to make them acceptable . 
  the usa also refused a lot of things ( opening their public market , refusing differing regulations , refusing to recognize * aop/aoc * , and so on . . ) . 
  my main problem with the previous post is '' * the eu has soured it 's relationship with the us by rejecting ttip * '' . 
  that 's bunch of bullshit , and it is pushing a very clear narrative by trying to spin it on the eu . 
  if he is able to pin the failure of those negotiations so precisely , the least he could do would be to cite sources for it . 
  and the sources necessary to demonstrate that would be absolutely enormous , given that you 'd have to walk back in the minute details of the negotiations , which were ** secrets ** in the first place . 
  this guy defends a spin , and is purely bullshitting . 
   the eu has soured it 's relationship with the us by rejecting ttip . 
  the us were the one having second thoughts about it and stalling the negotiations , not the eu . 
  i do n't know what kool-aid you drunk from your side of the atlantic , but here the narrative is that the eu was far more eager to please and find a compromise than the us , and that the us were not really that interested . 
  same as `` would of '' or `` then/than '' . 
  it 's a good indicator that the writer has english as a mother tongue . 
  what 's scary is when you start making those mistakes yourself . 
   i merely question whether those concerns are justified or rooted in emotion . 
  are you a troll ? 
  a government is trying to pass a law criminalizing a behavior that could be life-saving to some women , and you think that their concerns is somehow not justified ? 
  you told pretty explicitly that you were n't simply anti-choice , but that you considered the matter to be petty and beneath yourself . 
  please , your highness , keep your backward views and your trolling for your home country , we have enough lunatics to deal with here already . 
  first step , stop having a superiority complex . 
  yes , you could actually learn from other countries . 
  it 's quite common among countries and culture to watch what others are doing and trying to improve your own . 
  each time russia is criticized , its proponents will always , always get their panties twisted about it and rave about how the arrogant west is still trying to choke the poor bloke . 
  you see blatant corruption , lies , murders , and yet you are still raving about us saying `` mmmmh , that 's bad , m ` kay '' ? 
  what is your fucking problem ? 
  if that happened here , yes there would be a riot , there would a revolution , putin would be dead by now , or at least destitute . 
  each of our countries here is also criticized at one point or another . 
  russian will try to defend their country however a ** lot ** more than other nationalities . 
  maybe it 's time you reconsider the amount of propaganda you are subjected to every day . 
  russia lend weapons to some revolution to grab a landmass , said rebels shoot down a plane , and / r/russia will simply deny it and prefer to listen to the weapon manufacturer , as if it was more independent ? 
  what the flying fuck ? 
  stop drinking the kool-aid , recognize that your government can make mistakes and that things may not be perfect in your country . 
   something that is a comparatively minor issue causes a massive meltdown if it 's something that is minor to you , just shut up and let people for whom it is an important one voice their concerns . 
   though i know that is difficult for people so firmly convinced of their own moral and intellectual superiority and stop being so insufferably condescending and patronizing . 
  actually , they do n't . 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25tkxg5vws ), 
  public transit is extremely developed , yes . 
  busses everywhere , subways , tramways , trains . 
  i guess taxis would be exempted from the ban , or they would throw a hissy fit . 
  at 27 , he is not a millennial even . 
  he is gen y , if anything , and given how inconsistent and non-standard these appellations are . 
  millennials is just a catch-all word for `` youngster i want to disparage '' . 
   noble institutions ravaged that 's pretty good , for one . 
   the caused dozen of conflicts in the succeeding decades you mean , the other monarchies conspiring to keep their privileges ? 
  oh shit , how unjust it is that they were met with blood and steel !, 
  no it was n't stability , but it paved the road to a modern society . 
  inbred retards fucking each other is not a legitimate basis for a governance system . 
   you do n't know shit about what i believe that 's pretty rich coming from someone replying  you do n't [ see the world like me ] because it 's de rigueur and has been for a long time and it 's what the politicians we elect want us to believe you were arrogant like a teenager , condescending and patronising as if your thinking was the second coming of christ . 
  you stooping down to his level is not the service you think it is . 
  you mischaracterize your opponent 's thesis without even asking first about his position , and you want us to believe you when you say  i have questioned everything that can only be a joke . 
  `` over-correcting '' in french would be `` surcompenser '' i think . 
  a litteral translation back in english would be `` overcompensating '' . 
  take that info as you want . 
  beside that , what loulan 's says , that 's pretty much it . 
  well , yeah . 
   in its original form , populism is an ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogenous and antagonistic groups : `` the pure people '' and `` the corrupt elite '' , and argues that politics should be an expression of the volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ( general will ) of the people . 
   the main bad is that populism is a monist and moralist ideology , which denies the existence of divisions of interests and opinions within `` the people '' and rejects the legitimacy of political opponents . 
  as the populists are the vox populi , ie the voice of all the people , anyone with a different view speaks for `` special interests '' , ie the elite . 
  given that the key distinction is between the pure people and the corrupt elite , any compromise would lead to the corruption of the people and is therefore rejected . 
  this uncompromising stand leads to a polarised political culture , in which non-populists turn into anti-populists . 
  interesting article . 
  what is pretty funny is when both left and right populism are fighting each other , accusing the other side of siding with the corrupt elite . 
  it 's how we work , but expect that to evolve . 
  the comment your responded to made a reference to european regionalism . 
  we are building regions that have the landmass and the population of small countries .
