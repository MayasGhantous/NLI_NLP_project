  just look at the richest french people 's kids , none of them go to a grande \u00c9cole because the only way to enter them is to study in school . 
  and you are mixing everything up . 
  assas is a public university where everybody can enter without any exam exactly like paris i , upmc , dauphine , etc. , schools which provides great employment opportunities . 
  but in universities or in the grandes \u00c9coles you need to study if you want to have a good diploma . 
   i 'm not here to have an argument about whether we should privatize healthcare or not . 
  currently the state is taking care of pensions and healthcare , so their administration and financing is the responsibility of the government . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  why would n't it count as government spending and be compared to other better-administered countries ? 
  really ? 
  you want to compare the taxation and spending of a country which takes care of pension and healthcare to countries which does n't ? 
  well then obviously france will seem to tax and spend a lot . 
   listen my friend , i said corporate profitability was better abroad , not that you could n't do business in france . 
  show me where i said `` that it 's impossible to have a business '' . 
  you 're just assuming things and claim i said them ... `` starting a business might be cheap but you will never earn a lot of money after taxes . '', 
  `` you know he 's right '' . 
  that 's exactly the fixation i 'm talking about . 
  the vast majority of french people condemn these actions . 
  i do n't deny it exist , but it is not representative of france . 
  since the 1980 ' all the big national companies were privatized ( edf , gdf , la poste , areva , france t\u00e9l\u00e9com , total , bnp , st gobain , renault , etc. ), 
  and in total millions of people were laid off without any problems . 
  and in the private sector people are fired every day without any protest . 
  air france is an exception about a ceo who lied about firing people until the last minute and then those people were pissed of because they are unqualified workers who knows that they will never get any job again . 
  the people responsible for the violence were arrested and disciplinary sanctions have been taken . 
  and more importantly the layoff of employees has n't changed because of the protests . 
  to give you a comparison it 's as if every time the uk was mentioned and whatever the subject , the media would portray the british as either rich pedophiles or chavs . 
  no nuance , no middle ground , no complexities , 100 % of british citizens are just rich pedophiles and chavs . 
   we 're closer to the ussr than to a free-market economy . 
  i completely agree with you comrade . 
   when taxation represents 45 % of gdp and when government spending makes up 57 % of the gdp , we 're closer to the ussr than to a free-market economy . 
  now to put these figures in perspective , let 's not forget that the french state administers pensions and health insurance , which are responsible for about half of what is asked from households and companies in the form of taxation . 
  so if i read what you just wrote it means that if you take back the retirement pension , france 's taxation and government spending is average . 
  i agree with you that a state administrated retirement fund can have some downsides , but there are some upsides too . 
  in the end it 's just a matter of political choices . 
  personally i think that the retirement system is outdated and that we really need to update it . 
  but using this data without any comment on it , to point out that the government spends too much is either dishonest or show a complete lack of understanding in economics . 
   to go back to / u/feldheld 's point , yes , the profitability of french companies has been decreasing for decades and doing business in italy , germany , spain or the uk is much more profitable . 
  you can become rich owning by starting a company in france . 
  you can even become a millionaire or billionaire without any problems . 
  [ with 30 % , companies margins are more than enough ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;id=180 ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , a lot of reforms needs to be made in france . 
  but saying that it 's impossible to have a business there is completely stupid . 
  it is only useful to push liberal agendas and encourage a race to the bottom that everybody will lose from except billionaires . 
  yes you 're right , the tax situation was one thing that i remembered in particular . 
  but it is always the same clich\u00e9s , and they are pushing for the same agenda every time . 
  it 's tiring . 
  there is also a lot of clich\u00e9s from the french media about foreign countries but it 's harder to spot them as a french person . 
   it isnt conincidence that you always get childish replies from leftists . 
  oh ok , so you are a leftist then . 
  too bad . 
  no it 's not , ( [ france ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jecb8xetdegj:www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/ficdoc_frame.asp%3fref_id%3dip1064+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=fr ) , [ usa ] ( https://www.census.gov/ces/pdf/bds_statbrief4_exit_survival.pdf ) ) . 
  but culturally in france if you fail you are loser for the rest of your life , whereas in the us it 's not that bad . 
  it 's a general feeling about of how france is portrayed that you can find in a lot of articles . 
  the next time you read an article about france , just think about it and it will became obvious . 
  but for example here is [ a truly surreal article from newsweek ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/fall-france-225368?piano_t=1 ) or [ a this article in the new york times , it 's amazing , ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/opinion/sunday/dowd-goodbye-old-world-bonjour-tristesse.html?pagewanted=all ) or [ a 9 episodes clich\u00e9 fest in the atlantic ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/there-are-no-fat-people-in-paris/278162/ ) and finally [ a wonderful drinking game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dp5vuv7.jpg ) . 
  anglo-saxon media always use the same recipe when they talk about france . 
  they start by interviewing an insanely rich business owner who complains about taxes , even though he does n't pay a single euro since his company is legally based in bermuda , then they interview a millionaire living in the richest neighborhood of paris , who complains about income taxes , even though they do n't pay a single cent since through the magic of tax optimization , and finally the journalist conclude by saying `` you see , france is a nightmare for 0,000000001 % of its population , such a terrible place to live , i 'd rather live in somalia ! '', 
  absolutely , france is a communist dictatorship where the state takes literally all your money away . 
  please send us help !, 
  they are supposed to learn about history , french , english , literature , mathematics , etc. 
  in technical schools . 
  but right know they have a terrible culture and are terrible in theirs trades . 
  it really needs to change . 
  you should n't do more to become a plumber , an electrician , a carpenter , or a hairdresser . 
  the technical education in france really need a reform . 
  i 'm not talking about the bts , but about the bac pro , the cap , the bep etc. 
  a lot of student stop after these diplomas , especially if they came from a poor background , and afterward they are destined to a life of unemployment . 
   i would n't say that our bad schools are so terrible . 
  our bad schools are technical schools , and they are truly terrible . 
  in france there is a general high shool which is supposed to lead to university and a technical high shool which is supposed to teach students a trade so that they can directly work after graduation . 
  and usually you go to technical schools if you have bad grades in junior high school . 
  i remember that one of my greatest fear was to have bad grades and then be forced to go to a technical high school . 
  the problem is that technical high school is largely viewed as a child-care center for teenagers . 
  in these schools most students do n't master the basic rules of french ( sadly it 's not only immigrants but native french people too ) and they tend to be terrible in the trade they specialize in since most of them are here by default . 
  so obviously these schools are in most cases a direct path to life unemployment . 
   one thing we suck at tho , is language teaching . 
  once again , it depends where you study . 
  among my former classmate in high school everybody was speaking english perfectly and were quite good in spanish or german . 
  and in higher education , the grande \u00c9coles require you to speak english , and to spend at least a semester abroad . 
  but in general yes it 's awful . 
  especially for technical schools geared toward the service industry , waiters for instance usually do n't speak a single english word . 
  the french education system is very elitist . 
  from preschool to university there is a wide gap between the good schools and the bad schools . 
  so it is a very good system if you are lucky , and a terrible one if you are n't . 
  i bet on kevin . 
  according to the judge : `` it is against the interest of the child to bear such a name which can only lead to mockery or unkind comments . '', 
  [ source in french . 
  ] ( http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/region/nutella-fraise-le-tribunal-de-valenciennes-ia27b36956n2620052 ) remember school and imagine the nightmare to be called nutella . 
  in france the person responsible of registering names can seize the prosecutor if the parents decide to give their child a name against their interest . 
  so judges judged that the names nutella , baby , mj , joyeux ( happy ) , manhattan , etc. 
  were illegal .

  that 's strange . 
  i see the appeal for big companies , but there no benefit for the average french person . 
  really , where did you get this information ? 
  when you read le figaro everybody is against it , and when you read lib\u00e9ration everybody is for it . 
  the current system with 41 hours on average and the rtt to compensate seems to accommodate people . 
  neither chirac , nor sarkozy changed it . 
  in the land of freedom ^ tm everything is possible ( except healthcare and a a reasonably priced education ) . 
   this is more or less what happened in the french revolution and led to the terror when important revolutionary figures where executed because they were deemed as enemies of the revolution for not being radical enough . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that , the revolutionary leaders turned into dictators afraid of having theirs power slipping away and the common people was having its vengeance against the the aristocracy which used them for thousands of years .
