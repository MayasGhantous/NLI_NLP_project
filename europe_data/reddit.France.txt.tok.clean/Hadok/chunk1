i revise my assumption . 
  48 % of the russian are intellignet and 22 % are intelligent and cautious . 
  i am surprised to see we are not that bad !, 
  half of russian are intelligent , and the other half are intelligent and cautious, 
  actually they are currently making mercenary work for putin in ukraine . 
  the tragedy actually happened in 1917 and lasted very long, 
  yes , other parts in the article can show how much lost he seem to be :  he said he found it difficult to believe the `` official '' version of the september 11 attacks , adding that there was doubt about the `` merah affair '' -- referring to the al-qaeda inspired french gunman , mohammed merah , who killed seven people in the south of france in 2012 . 
  the demand is not * low * because we import lots of things . 
  yes , it is the quantity of work that is important . 
  i think too that everyone should work . 
  but if you take our country with its high minimum wage and taxes , one employer only employ someone if he earn more than he cost . 
  thoses that arent worth the minimum wage with taxes are unemployed and will stay unemployed while it is here . 
  we should fix it to allow more people to work . 
  but many would oppose it , and if we dont do it , the only way to produce more withouth employing more people is to make them work longer . 
  most salarymen dont work on saturday , only those working in shops and some others . 
  working on sunday ... is forbidden !, 
  you need either to be in some sectors that can not close ( hospitals , cafees ... ) , or to get an authorisation . 
  at least he did not use neo-liberal or ultra-liberal . 
  but i think your explication is a little short . 
  working more create more good and services , hence there are more goods to redistribute to other people , but we are importing a lot of thoses and exporting nearly none . 
  the problem is that our work regulation are horrid . 
  with a fixed minimum wage , high taxes and a high basic income ( rsa ) it make no sense working cheap or employing someone who isent already an high value worker . 
  while we should manage to sell more good and services , working longer may not be the solution ... but working on week-ends to sell more service to tourists might be needed . 
  working the night could also reduce the need for investments as the same factory could turn longer , but above all , we need to dump the minimum wage . 
  and the return back to totalitarian times with extra militarism . 
  the more it goes , the more it remind me of north korea trolling diplomaty, 
  what the fuck did i read ? 
  first it is on rt , then someone resize it for liveleak with a similar rt grade description and make it pass as an other thing than crass russian propaganda . 
  i am afraid that france and japan are above united kingdom . 
  japan being the absolute winner as / u/ekferti84x denoted it . 
  ** you know , bankers only `` run '' countires in conspiracy theories **, 
  thats how it start , but when you start pouring money and there is no effect , you start pounding more till you are overriden in debt and its your first expense post . 
  and it is not a theoricall situation : look at france . 
  out of 100 people that were asked if they loved putin , only stupid and suicidals didnt answer yes . 
  they have european papers but they consider themselves citizens of the islamic state . 
  seem like a good base to me . 
  sarkozy has a terrible ammount of affair for 5 year of presidency . 
  from the day he was elected , everything showed the worst was to come : he make of his function a joke by going to a club to celebrate , then to a big industrial 's yatch just after his election while he pretended to meditate , then his presidency was a tragi comic show when he reacted to everithing by making something but achieving nothing . 
  but to be fair , he is the worst of the last 50 years . 
  before that we had also quite a number of bollocks , especially if you count petain the collaborator . 
  what a shitty article . 
  no technicals details , no source no video . 
  ritalin ? 
  first there is a traditionnal deep divide between right and left in france ( even if far left/far right are constantly saying they are the same because they are all not communists/fachists , one can not make coalition with right and left ) and second , center right is not well . 
  bayrou alone saved them when sarkozy tried to merge them , but he is quite tired , and they are one main target of the right . 
  beside the fact that the socialist parties allies himself with far left and communists is a reason enough for them not to support them . 
  ** france ** * more debate around the homosexual marriage becuase some couples that did use surrogacy in other countries were allowed to adopt the child . 
  some say that thoses family should be forbidden to adopt childs conceived though surrogacy . 
  * sarkozy did recently come back and is carrying political meeting arount the country , but jupp\u00e9 is trying to counter him . 
  he holded a debate in [ `` des paroles et des actes '' ] ( http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/1246402-alain-juppe-fait-un-carton-a-dpda-sur-france-2-nicolas-sarkozy-devrait-s-inquieter.html ) * [ affairs are also rounding up around sarkozy ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20141005/three-allies-of-frances-sarkozy-charged-in-fraud-probe ) * our economy is in shambles . 
  deficits targets wont be met and we are now under 2 thousands billions euros of debt . 
  * a nurse that was infected by ebola [ is now cured ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20141004-french-nurse-cured-ebola-health-minister-msf-touraine/ ) * [ psg did won against fc barca ] ( http://www.euronews.com/sport/2713382-psg-sweat-over-ibra-fitness-for-barca-clash/ ) in the champion 's league, 
  manuel valls may be determined to this task , but he has no mean to fix france . 
  he is a member of the socialist party , which is torn between democrat liberal and keynesians . 
  moreover , they are in bed with ecologists and far leftists , which are constantly trying to discredit it while supporting it in the pools to keep elected seat . 
  this party has not a chief culture like the right party , and whenever some head of the party announce a decision some dont like , they start undermining the said reform . 
  their popularity are in shambles and they can not use popular support anymore . 
  so , while manuel valls may a man to fix france he has not the troops to do it , and i frankly dont see how france could be fixed in the next 20 years , except if there is a hard crisis putting lucidity in our politics . 
  on the other hand , in india , those who know english tend to trump the caste system and manage to get better positions . 
  not that it really matter in ukraine , but with the war , collaboration with russia are hampered and ukrainian entreprise will have to work with europeans ones . 
  german and polish will also be usefull . 
  where has the journalist been !, 
  there has been numerous shelling and attacks reported in donesk and near mariupol . 
  there are even videos of pro russian troops shooting from civilian houses . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2i0taw/rebels_firing_at_donetsk_airport_from_civilian/ as in the first ceasefire , pro russian troops has never stoped firing . 
  putin is not relaible , invaded crimea with unmarked troops and is now using an other covert invasion in eastern ukraine while not respecting any agreement , starting with the budapest memorandum . 
  the level of violence is nowhere near what was observed in other historical period !, 
  we are at an all time low !, 
  well , then it seem that the russian reversal is on their genetic code . 
  well , petrol monarchies are free to stop selling oil if the learn to grow plant on the desert . 
   the progress made by europe in xviii century relied on the poor condition of women and children . 
  that is utterly wrong . 
  while poor condition for children and women has been the norm since the mediaeval age , and is still the norm in most countries , education has been a key factor in devellopement . 
  religious group still entrenched in this medieval behaviour might blame others for their failures , but they are the only factor . 
  when religion guide your society into obedience , progress , technology and education are hampered . 
  moreover , the `` if god wills it '' mentality dont push anyone to accomplish anything . 
  they dont suck because we exist , but because they suck . 
  hard to believe he did know nothing . 
  not likely , but not impossible . 
  with a weakened leadership in the left and a divided right , anything could come up in the 2nd row . 
  anyway , even not elected , they represent a force powerfull enough to sabotage our defenses . 
  except when it is russia doing the incursion . 
  they are actually putin pawns and while they follow a racist ideology , they are working against their respective countries . 
  mostly because our official working time is limited to 35 hour per week , and people actually work more than they declare, 
  if ukraine does not do that what then ? 
  war ? 
  again ? 
  it is time to stop putin mob style geopolitics . 
  there is a similar warning in france . 
  there was an article about russian spies trying to approach politician industrials and journalists . 
  first they give some gifts and then they threathen to oust you if you dont work for them . 
  let the butthurt begin . 
  only talking for france , most wellfare are still available if you have a low revenue job ( or a numerous family ) . 
  for the basic income style one , you keep it the first three month then you have a part of it depending on your salary ( here is a form http://www.caf.fr/aides-et-services/connaitre-vos-droits-selon-votre-situation/vous-changez-de-situation/vous-beneficiez-du-revenu-de-solidarite-active-rsa-et-vous-avez-trouve-du-travail ) but considering our high level minimum wage , you are pretty much out of it if you are full time employed and living alone . 
  i dont tend to find it is a disencitive to work , but it is a great incentive to undeclared work ( or criminal activity ), 
  an other question . 
  to simplify the problem , lets consider that a specific tax is set to subsidy basic income while other governement expenditure are on other taxes ( like tarifs ) given that you need to collect as much money as you redistribute , isent the supposed `` universal '' basic income in fact only a subsidy for a part of the population and a tax for the other part . 
  now if you had governement expenditure , you have a tax for the major part of the population and subidies for the most poor . 
  while i see the need to susidies , i tend to think that this idea of basic income is no more than a marketing coup to pass it at a magical income . 
  hello , are you advocating for the low-level conservative universal income supposed to eliminate wellfare and subsidy to replace it with a small life saving minimum , or for the liberal utopia of unlimited ressources high level universal income as high , or are you trying to play on the ambiguity ?
