  [ a video showing several men dressed up in full combat gear refusing to explain who they are has stirred curiosity in ukraine . 
  these men are not wearing any known police or army insignia , which has led to rumours swirling about their identity . 
  ] ( http://observers.france24.com/content/20140128-ukraine-mysterious-men-forces-russia ), 
  all right . 
  how many men still remain with yanukovych ? 
  le pen being the leader of a political party , a forgein support for a politic , and an especially critical one like this is not a good thing neither for russian or le pen image . 
  depardieu is also more of a wildcard , and while the fact that he is in russia could be benefictal , the way he left somehow balance this . 
  i dont know how socchi will play out . 
  it will certainely bring a lot of attention to russia , but it will cost a lot . 
  i dont that values by themselves are an obstacle , however , they dont help putin 's image . 
  i am by no way a diplomatic expert , but i think cultural events can play a very important role . 
  you said a lot of things about the us , and it is true that russia is a lot more concerned by the us policies than europe . 
  russia often react to every us moves while they are not us main concern . 
  in the same way , some of these reactions intended at the us may have been resented as highly threatening to europeans . 
  the declaration about missiles in kalilingrad is more threatening to europe than us . 
  pressure to poland and baltic countries may have been badly resented by these countries . 
  europe has a lot of countries , and an efficient diplomacy to europe can be quite difficult , however some moves like the assassination of an opponent into london may have legitimately made europan embassies cautious of russian diplomacy . 
  on the all , i think russian politics may have appeared as cold or threatening to europe , because russia had not an european strategy either and considered other factors before them ( as posturing to the us by example ) i think you also underestimated the kosovo war in your historical recapitulation . 
  you should aslo take into account the recent georgia war . 
  while its legitimacy could be discussed , its threat factor is nonetheless real . 
  europe want a nice relation with russia and has been quite proactive during mendvedev ... but poutin 's agressive stance did put this relation at risk . 
  russia need to ditch its anti-western reflex and build a cooperative relation with europe . 
  sadly , if most of the russian i know are sympathetic , putin seem to have a grudge with europe . 
  contrary to the article , i dont think that europe qhould play putin games and become an opposant of russia , but i think that europe need to think its diplomacy with russia , not with putin , and build a direct trust relationship with russians . 
  and with what will you enforce it ? 
  if there is more protester and noloyal bekrut remaining , it 's not time for martial law , it 's time for aeroflot . 
  in other news , the ukranian people have confirmed their separation with yanoukovitch, 
  what happened at 3:40 : their chief seem to talk to them and after that they cross the crowd . 
  did they actually surrendered themselves to the protesters ? 
  well , it is not a nice agreable deal . 
  more like a [ disputed one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_disputes ) putin is using this deal as a pressure mean , but once ukraine is secured inside his custom union , he will want his money back . 
  ukraine depending on russia humor for his gas is not viable . 
  ukraine need to buy gas from russia or anyone at market price , and ask payement for any russian advantage ( like the naval base or the gazoduc ), 
  the problem with gas is more the price than any other thing . 
  russia can not and would not deprive ukraine of gas , as any country could resell russian gas . 
  the problem is that russia had the habit of giving lower prices to ukraine , and nothing can prevent them from stopping their fidelity bonus . 
  ( exept if this can be balanced with crimea naval base ) no long term solution relying on russia gaz can exist . 
  if russia dont play this card for the custom union , they will play it for an other reason . 
  ukraine and russia need to clear their diplomatic and economic relation to go on on good bases . 
  sadly , putin stance and russia size dont allow a fair deal for ukraine . 
  it wont be a burden for the biggest country , because at this level a lot is done by negociation , and influence play a bigger role than vote alone , but for the middle countries , it might be more problematic as they would have an other big player to take int o account . 
  however , europe do fear that a country with low revenue and high corruption might extend its network in other countries , and increase criminality and unemployement . 
  but if the revolution in ukraine work out , europe will have no other moral choice than to accept an ukraine entry in adhesion process if asked . 
  anyway , most of the central european country will support it . 
  well , with european integration there is pressure against corruption . 
  that may not be a magic wand of course , but european institution will slowly pressure against coruption , while providing more opportunities for thoses who make affairs honestly ( more markets , more contractors etc. ), 
  it is also about democracy as any path with russia will lead to more authoritatives forms of governement , and any path with europe will lead to more democratics reforms . 
  i disagree with you , but i will upvote you so we can aslo hear the voice of thoses that dont support thoses revolutions . 
  ( not that you dont support them , but you catch my meaning ), 
  so they are already considering an euromeidan victory ... this smell very good . 
  i put the beginin of the article in the megathread . 
  i guess that i will delete this link . 
  done,

  within a few minutes all the inputs to these units have blocked dozens of cars with emergency lights on what was to suggest technical problems . 
   during this time , the gates came several hundred people from the surrounding skyscrapers , who quickly banded together by the cells . 
  when one of the trucks with soldiers tried to leave the unit , protesters stopped it first , and then pierced the tire . 
   since that time , each unit guarding the dozens of people who coordinate through facebook and cells . 
  because blocking is forbidden , the official version is that the people there just walking .

  following urnial etiquette , you should use one of the lateral one . 
  first , i dont think that there will be a trully military response . 
  that would be simply too dangerous for everyone . 
  a paramilitary response on the other hand seem to be already in action . 
  the targeted sms , abductions and beatings ... i dont think they were spontaneous and unprepared . 
  considering it is the protester that declare a truce , this can not be a trap . 
  however , the simple fact that the protester are in position to declare a truce and conduct negociation should be a good enough signal for yanukovych . 
  they were labbeled ... 
   ukraine is very important to us . 
  not as a satellite state , but as a neighbor and a relative . 
  your future is in increasead trade relation with european union . 
  ukraine will not move , and it is probable that all treaty and trades russia has with ukraine will remain if they are a part of eu . 
  has eu set any claim to kalilingrad or threatened the russian transit to it ? 
  eu has not taken an agressive stance to russia , and has in fact been willing to increase its cooperation and trade with russia you can be indigned that european leader critic the putin authoritarive politics , but that would be hypocrisy as russia is also supporting political parties in europe ( like fn in france ) , and still considering that baltic states affairs concern them . 
  i am very puzzled by russia ( or should i say putin ? ), 
  stance on its relation with europe . 
  i wonder if the security forces had to go back to teir barracks on foot after their buses were destroyed . 
  i would be actually okay if the roosbeefs used the metric system .
