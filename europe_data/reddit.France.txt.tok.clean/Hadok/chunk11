  [ the two sides really hate each other ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20140116-france-underestimated-religious-hatred-araud-central-africa-un/ ) , but their inapt president was finally removed and new presidency elections are due . 
  * a soccer champion who pulled a berlusconi [ is set for trial . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20140119/soccer-stars-set-for-under-age-prostitute-trial ) * catholics demonstrated against abortion * serge dassault , a high profile politician that was implied in many affairs was set to have his immunity removed , but the commission did suprinsingly vote against it , while most of its members are saying they voted for the immunity removal but some are obviously lying . 
  * a man in a coma since a long time ( and who has no chance of waking up again ) is the object of a judiciary affair . 
  the wife and most of the family want to let him die , but the parents are opposed to it . 
  this affair launched the debate on euthanasy again . 
  in russia , human right commission report you !, 
  it make no sense dealing with a group of hundred people the same way than a group of hundredth thousand of people . 
  i dont know why you seem to consider that we should consider them the same way as if the whole barcelona population was on the street . 
  i dont know enough of you to debate everything you ranted about but i believe that you missed the point by a large margin . 
  would you assume that if a vast majority of people did want a specific change , their claim should be considered legitimate to begin with ? 
  i only did comment on the group size , not on their cause ( wich i dont know by the way ) . 
  but actually yes . 
  a crowd legitimity is on its size . 
  if you have a whole city on the street , you can assume that all your population is angry enough to want a change in politics . 
  if it is a small group , you can not conclude anything . 
  [ le hum !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_england_riots ), 
  contrasting with the huge manifestations in ukraine , this small group is really pitifull . 
  how come the top comment with +5 suddenly drop to -1 ? 
  brigading in action ? 
  moubarack was only ousted wahn the army stopped supporting him ... and they were even faster to remove him . 
  protest are a good way to show and share your discontent , but as long as the power can rely on a tiny part of the population in strategic positions , they can hold the governement , police , military , judiciary and other administrations . 
  isent slippery slope a fallacy to begin with ? 
  this title sound incredilby odd and accurate at the same time . 
  i 'm glad that it is finally over and that they wont bother us anymore . 
  well , we were in thoses aera some decades ago and it was not that bad . 
  in fact , they drove us out . 
  if we were in their shoes i guess we would make some nice places out of these countries ( again ) . 
  we are going to pretend that this week didnt happen in france , okay . 
  actually , i was more thinking about valerie and the actress ? 
  but cecilia sarkozy would also be a valid anwser, 
  which one ? 
  actual title : `` french court backs ban on comedy show deemed anti-semitic '' there is no `` perception '' factor in dieudonne anti-semitic speech . 
  you can have your opinion on free speech or on anti semitism , but claiming that dieudonne speech would not be anti-semitic is just an hypocrisy that is destroying the credibility of thoses who may want to oppose this ban . 
  actually , this was so intense that the / r/france moderators banned all political speech for a one month duration . 
  we had daily threads about dieudonne before , and people did get the habit of downvoting every thread talking about him on sight . 
  there was no debate possible with its supporter ( wich were most of the time know or assumed far right posters , but also conspiracy theorist talking about the jewish conspiration ) http://fr.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1u4vl3/janvier_2014_mois_sans_politique_sur_rfrance/, 
  dieudonne was very active on internet , and did not anyone to make its publicity . 
  / r/france was consitently spammed with dieudonne publicity . 
  moreover , he instigated a trend of making altered nazi salute in offending places and taking selfies , using friend in show buisness . 
  this of course made him an incredible publicity . 
  dieudonne is a multirecidivist which was condemned many time for hate speech ( but never payed its fines ) . 
  as it was obvious this tour was mostly a glorification of anti jew hate speech , the french interior minister , manuel valls banned it . 
  dieudonne made an appeal in the last time ( the day of the show ) , but the minister beated him by convoquing the higest court in the evening . 
  fans massed for the show but found closed doors . 
  the fact that france relinquished its nationalist pride has little to do with the eu , and much more with wwii , algeria war , communist activists and anti nationalist intellectuals . 
  will eu take the place of this downed nationalism ? 
  maybe in the far future , but for now , there dont seem to be an european nationalistic feeling . 
  well , doing this salute in front of synagogue , concentration camps , terrorists attacks locations ... could be understood as incitation toward violence . 
  well , i talked once to a un african worker who told me how m23 was in fact a group supported by other countries and how us did pressure these countries ( to stop it ) . 
  it aslo involve tusti thematic and there has been troubles just this week with them . 
  i guess that if i say m23 you will ask me wheter highway i am talking about . 
  if someone cared about africa here , rwanda genocide would have been a thing . 
  atctually , if you talk to some african , they do care and it is a thing right now . 
  it has still impact on interafrican relations and there are still a strong ressentement between hutu and tutsi communities . 
  i did talk about when it occured . 
  i wonder why you did not see it by the way . 
  perhaps it was not about your center of interest as you said it . 
  also , any explanation on [ that ? 
  ] ( http://fr.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ty8kf/two_russian_teen_girls_decapitated_a_homeless_man/ ), 
  not good i 'm afraid . 
  i 'll update it,

  * and as nizcar told lower , our national antisemite made some fuss about something offensive probably , so it did make some more fuss in the end . 
  * i didnt heard about it in france , but apparently , thelocal is reporting that a [ feminist row occured about a french mosquee ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20131227/muslim-women-slam-mosques-separation-of-sexes ) * while we are at it , russian won a bid about a [ new ortodox church in paris ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20131226/russian-church-set-to-built-near-eiffel-tower ) * in central africa , [ mass graves were discovered ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131226-mass-grave-discovered-bangui-car/ ) * tchad troop angered local population by shooting protester dead and were then [ assaulted ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131226-french-tanks-deploy-gunfire-erupts-car-bangui-central-republic/ ) .

  well , even if is from a british source , and they might be quite optimistic , you wont read a similar assertion from any other european country . 
  sucessfull thing or not ? 
  youngs were employed under subsidied contracts , but as it was not successfull , the governement pressured his own administrations into taking them . 
  so while our administrations are one one side pressured to cut their expense by reducing number of positions , they must employ low level worker they dont need . 
  hurray . 
  our industry ministry talked a lot about helping factories in danger , but the problem are multiplying as our economy is still structurally bad . 
  no impact on unemployemend . 
  high taxes and bad education ( not because of ressources , but because they ideologically dont want to form worker ) are bringing us down . 
  in top of this we have an universal allocation [ `` rsa '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revenu_de_solidarit%c3%a9_active ) . 
  guess what : it really dont work as basic income fan would like to make you believe it do . 
  lots of bureacracy , fraud , and unicentive for work . 
  i wish we would not rejoice ourself of `` avoiding '' recession, 
  the joke is implying that in his trip to algeria was dangerous , and that it is a miracle he came safe . 
  that may be either because algeria is know for having a lot of terrorism in the past ( and a bit in the present ) or because valls is our interior minister , and could have faced people he expelled from france . 
  anyway , algeria is pissed . 
  car situation dont seem to have many hope in it . 
  rebels and militia keep killing each others , and muslim and chrisian population are still on the verge of genocide . 
  if you have some time , you should visit [ cadac\u00e9s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cadaqu%c3%a9s ) near rosas . 
  it is a small fishing village hidden between a valley and the sea , and it is the home of famous painter [ dali ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvador_dal%c3%ad ) ; book in advance to visit his house . 
  also enjoy the neigbooring national park and [ monastery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sant_pere_de_rodes ) . 
  there are strong rumors about putin agents makin him request it . 
  i know , but considering how the post about nsa spying on charities got attention here , i supposed it could not harm to recall basics . 
   they 're also driven by the worst drivers on the road . 
  of course they are , they are taxis !, 
  ** france ** * our president made a good joke . 
  when receiving the council of french jews , he stated that his minister did come back from algeria safe and sound , and that was already a lot . 
  algeria is not happy . 
  * we had a debate about euthanasia .
