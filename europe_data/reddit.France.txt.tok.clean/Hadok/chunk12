  * about medical news , check out ou brand new artificial heart . 
  take that google glasses !, 
  [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10532427/france-implants-its-first-artificial-heart.html ) * paris subway had a technical problem . 
  only parisian were harmed [ the local ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20131220/four-paris-metro-lines-grind-to-a-halt ) * our intervention in central africa dont seem really effective . 
  seleka rebel and self defense militia keep killing each others . 
  however , we did , at least , receive the help of an other european country . 
  [ i hope hussards will be effective ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/156611,poland-set-to-support-france-in-african-peace-keeping-mission ) * privates driver will be allowed to take and transport people . 
  they can not have a taxy light , and can not roam the street for client , but can be called by phone . 
  taxy organisation did want to impose a mandatory wait of 15 minutes between the call and the transport , but were rebuffed . 
  * a french ecologist senator was caught with 18 000 $ of unpaid fines for his car . 
  bonians are already in europe , and they are not making a good image . 
  we even have a wiki about the [ hamidovic gang ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a9seau_hamidovic ), 
  authority is freedom . 
  we indeed live in 1984 world . 
  it would be a scandal if nsa agent did not assert that humanitarian association were not used as a cover for supporting terrorist , as it is the case for many supposed caricative association , whose money ends up funding djihad . 
  yes , contract to france , we are not spying , honest . 
  well , proclaming that you wow to eradicate every one of them is a way to discourage the idea , isent it ? 
  or pro expense we could call them the expensists or expenditists, 
  i guess this will ban yoghourts and some sprouts . 
  great timing . 
  for a more efficient communication , order will be given in deutshe . 
  schmetterling !!, 
  free elections , democracy , free press . 
  they are sure promising the inhabitant some goodies to uproot the legitimate dictator . 
  giving money to avoid being tergeted by terrorist is not efficient . 
  we should only help the terrorists ennemies . 
  good for them . 
  how come the european court can rule a case involving switzerland . 
  were they steahtily integrated into eu ? 
  well , kalilingrad would n't last long if there was an open conlfit , so they are more here as a threat than as a real defense asset . 
  turkey joining eu . 
  there is no chance they are real . 
  basically they are the same as my thoughts on unicorns . 
  a simple tunnel beetween dover and calais will never make as much as it will cost . 
  the only way to boost travel between france and england would be a direct lodon-paris railway . 
  thats nice , but i dont believe that the level of hate we receive is in relation with the help we give . 
  that would make 500 $ the ukranian . 
  the brits are going to be so jealous over this . 
  how about we stopped suporting those who hate us altogether to begin with . 
  i bet they somehow blame france peace conditions or the 1929 economic crisis . 
  good day dear us wannabe activist . 
  albeist north atlantic treaty organisation , europe is not your personal army . 
  its not the thing that removed slobodan ? 
  darn , the cia helped the demise of a genocidal warmonger !, 
  well , you of course planned to stay in germany for the whole octoberfest , didnt you . 
  if your goal is really beer , you should just make a t-shirt of the deutshe landers, 
  the eu should help the economy of the eu zone , and not some group of people, 
  ** france ** * this week we intervened in central africa . 
  we landed easy on the airport , and secured the hospital but each morning see more bodies scattered on the streets . 
  our show of force didnt seem to calm the rebels and militia . 
  * hollande hosted a summit with ban ki moon and other african leader about supporting the creation of africans intervention corps that could intervene in thoses situation . 
  * hollande said he will be attending mandela funeral with sarkozy * one of our politician recognized in a tv show that he watched youporn `` as everybody '' . 
  * still more protests about taxes for truckers . 
  * french sale about amerindian mask maintained despide the indian tribe complain . 
  * we did get in a somehow easy world cup group , but dont feel confident to win it . 
  * miss france was elected . 
  it is flora coquerel * not a related subject , but the law prohibing prostitution did pass the first chamber . 
  it should pass the second later . 
  * a toy 's r us was robbed with heavy weapons . 
  thatcher would n't have lasted long in france . 
  its not the eurozone that need reform the most , its some of its countries . 
  france is in deseperate need of reforms , but plagued with a lot of immobilism and corporatism interests . 
  well , the genocidal side could also maintain itself in power and deny it ever happened like turkey . 
  bologne process and erasmus were two great things , but this dont propose many real things . 
  proposition 3 is already pushed a lot by our politician , but decried a lot by our teacher and teachers 's and sutent 's unions . 
  ukraine president reject europe , but ukrainians seem to consider it . 
  it is funny by the way , how `` droit '' and `` right '' mean each the same three things in english and french . 
   maybe we should , indeed , seriously consider making french an official language again ftfy, 
  so , trolling hard today ? 
  in france fn stand for front national , our far right nationalist anti european party . 
  they are not even pro europe as a continent , but pro russia and arab leaders ( any authoritarian leader actually ) . 
  their candidate in this election is a lunatic , that is saying how much they consider eu parliement . 
  i meant that one just need to place a prostitute in a bounga bounga, 
  meanwhile other get money for murders http://fr.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/1s94cm/financial_incentive_for_criminals/, 
   the committee is proposing that minority language rights should be granted only in places where at least half of population is from an ethnic minority , instead of a third , as under the current minority rights legislation . 
  i fail to see how this may be radical in any way . 
  that bond will probably cost ukraine a lot . 
  who need an agency to spy on italian secrets anyway ? 
  not looking good in france . 
  be ready for a good proportion of anti european who probably wont siege anyway , and when they will , they will troll you to bits . 
  for the decision that require vast extra funding at least . 
  when funds are needed , it is the countries that are able to provide the fund that can say yes or nicht . 
  however , in other decision , influence and number of deputy are the thing . 
  deputy number is higher for most populated countries , but not proportional i think . 
  it was german , and in the mindset of immediate post wwii , less germany was a good thing for everyone . 
  you can assume that we are the usa of africa , and you are uk . 
  he will get sacked for mentioning them anyway . 
  he is warning that the protester might escalate , or that he might escalate the repression ? 
  the soviet empire strike back ? 
  did you read the article . 
  it state that nato adhesion require the consent of current member . 
  serbia and russia can not oppose as they arent nato members btw , i didnt know that kosovo was a nato member . 
  at 2:30 is this policeman attacking an other one ? 
  i second that, 
  and it will also allow 63 millions brittons to purchase vacation properties near the black sea . 
  full glass cabin , lights , front and rear radial tires with deep footprints ...

  tanks are not for making prisoniers ... but that would be an incredibly bad move for yanoukovitch .
