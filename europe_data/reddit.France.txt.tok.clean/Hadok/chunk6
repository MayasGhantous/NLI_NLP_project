  a russian europe is a very bad one . 
  to be fair , withouth an integrated command , chances are we would suffer a lot even with high budget . 
  would irish army move on their own if the russian invaded finland ? 
   ironically the only people who would oppose are german type green parties who hate nuclear not because of fukushima actually ... but to them investing in nuclear is somehow `` stealing money that could of been used to invest in renewables '' i actually wonder . 
  knowing that pacisifst movement were originaly supported by ussr . 
  knowing that these pacifist are closely related to anti nuclear activists , and knowing that russia need to sell its fossil fuels in europe to sustain its military activity , how much a chance would there be that these groups would be encouraged in these anti nuclear views by russia ? 
  we have a saying in france that `` impossible is not french '' . 
  the last time our energy was threatened , we develloped a cuting edge nuclear technology . 
  time to do it again in european scale . 
  what , are you on rt ? 
  all those past week russia rufeused to even meet their ukrainian counterpart , and the agreement about anticipated election was signed by ukraine , france , germany , poland , but the case for lavror remained empty as he already an invasion !, 
  it is hard to judge the tone of the letter as i am not used to diplomatic language , but it seem it is an answer to the russian threat to cut gas to europe barroso reitered the need for a meeting between europe , russia and * third parties * ( read ukraine ) and recalled putin that it was gazprom responsability to supply said gas . 
  employement . 
  i am starting to think that he was a propaganda tool to begin with . 
  actually , by switching from russian bought gas from energies that require more work in the palce of production , like wind or nuclear , we could help our economy . 
  they are often off beat when talking of my country . 
  not in a propagandist way but more like they just see what they are told by their source and dont know the things underlaying the affair, 
  well , he would surely be very angry and would have cancelled trade deal we will have to cancel anyway . 
  moreover , he could have supported protest or even attacks against european troops . 
  in a more recent survey , 98 out of 100 resident of eastern ukraine showed strong support for a russian intervention . 
  the other 2 stated respectively `` i bet your gun isent even loaded '' and `` you didnt even let me time to answer '', 
   when someone points out their imperialist , expansionist desires the irnoy in your comment is so strong that it could be used to make guns for the self defense force if the russian did not take care of that already . 
  it seem fitting to constructively criticise one posting quality when he choose a poor source for an information . 
  anyone can have an advice on the subject , but reliable source should be used , not activists sources that are taking side on the subject . 
  it is apparently a judiciary report , and explain some things . 
  this appeal actually happened a month ago about an affair of 2010 ( yes our judiciary is usually that late when numerous appeal are made ) . 
  are you in hope of french sources as this happened in france ? 
  i looked them a bit but at this point i did not find anything on major news sites . 
  cassation court mean breakening courts . 
  they are over watch of r\u00e9gular court and they break jugement if there is a proc\u00e9dural fault . 
  at best they could have said that \u00e0 previous trial had no fault in it but if they see one a regular court is set again, 
  electronicintifada ... what a source !, 
  there wasent any before you came , but as i know you , i suspect that a racist speech will follow , hence your premptive strike that will surely be followed by a somehow antisemitic comment and posturing against the denunciation of these . 
  strangely , in / r/france there is not that much pro russians . 
  we used to have a very active pro-russian far-right the red pill like poster with multiple accounts , but he wast deleted . 
  since then apart from the usual anti westerners , it seem pretty calm . 
  i agree . 
  europe should compensate israel for all the aid that finished in terrorist hands . 
  unstopable but we have no direction yet, 
  it is the most popular sport in europe , but the fact is that they play in the european league , not the african or asian one . 
  would n't it be simpler if you did respectively did apply to be the 51th and 52th states, 
  well i dont think they would like to join as a british possession, 
  well israel play in uefa is a democracy , a former roman empire possession and the birthplace of christianity while canada is clearly on the other side one could debate whether isra\u00ebl is in europe, 
  that should be asked to the russians, 
  i wonder how many of them were fsb, 
  so it voluntary induce us in error, 
  or just troops to the eastern border so russia will see they have no hope of invading ukraine, 
   the european identity is a lie created by the usa in an attempt to destroy nation states and flood the continent with non-white immigrants what the heck ? 
  you can critic humanist and multiculturalism but spouting conspiracy theories about it is ridiculous . 
  actually , france contributed a lot to humanism and universalities idea . 
  they also encouraged immigration as they simply needed a lot of manpower from their colonies to fight germany . 
  just fyi , in europe , liberal dont mean the same thing as in usa . 
  consider crimea . 
  apc and modern optics for assault rifles are found everywhere . 
  google crimean self defense forces for more info, 
  mainly because unemployement is not receeding but other factor played . 
  his gay marriage law made him unpopular in religious circles , and he didnt appear to have achieved anything beside that . 
  well , it was the only possible choice as it was the only popular stateman remaining in ps side . 
  your call for moderation and rationality failed because of its style . 
  well , given how they are more and more aligned with putin and less abour france , and given the current context i found it was more descriptive of their position . 
  ** france ** * a teen passing through a rail station was fined for having headphones [ relevant thread ] ( http://fr.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21p8xk/french_rail_company_fine_a_youth_300_for_using/ ) * we are voting for our mayor . 
  the russian aligned far-right party fn is expected to make moderate progress and gain the mayorship of some cities .

  google trad is often bad, 
  also a big hit in the marginally less sane / r/conspiracy, 
  it is a world with a ridiculously high minimum wage forbiding de facto non rentable works, 
   russian expansionist moves into europe not that i adhere of it , but to their point of view , it is more like europe is dangerously moving inside their puppet states with indecents promises of freedom and equal treatement . 
  wasent there a memorendum about ukraine by the way ? 
  heck , they could even claim low earth orbit while they are at it . 
  i think it is indeed more a feeling than a official political course , but while there is indeed homosexuals in fn , they are very close to the anti-gay marriage groups . 
  they may not be homophobic ( though a good part of their member must be ) but they are very fond of familial values and critical of gay marraige and even talk about the `` gay lobby '' . 
  it does sound a bit like putin war on gay propaganda . 
  well , as i said in my comment , i am not on their head and dont know why they think the way they think . 
  i would n't know . 
  some elements however : * pg 's head is still idealising ussr and is a strong support of venezuella . 
  * fn like putin 's stance on authority and homosexuality . 
  * both loathe americans and even the european union . 
  so , that explain how the spontaneous self defense force were able to have modern assault rifles , stun grenades , trucks , apc and attack helicopters . 
  ** france ** in an interesting turn , while our far right and our far left sided with russia ( note : historically , far left leaders were agents of ussr and far right is more or less supported by putin 's russia ) , our green movement has expressed indignation over the crimean take-over and putin policies in general . 
  if you want my opinion , hartz like reforms aimed at competitivity . 
  competitivity is making product that we manage to sell . 
  left wing parties are already making shot at it even if it is not already in motion because they know it is unavoidable . 
  so much errors in your post . 
  french right party , ump is hardly pro gay marriage . 
  keneysian policies proved an utter failure and are not on the table anymore . 
  `` neo-liberal '' is just a coined propaganda term no one can define . 
  color me surprised . 
  the way the level of danger can actualy be mapped is convenient, 
  crimea is not soft they had already soldier on place and profited that ukraine was in turmoil , but it has many cities and is * nearly * an island . 
  they deployed quite a great deal of influence by mean of media and * spontaneous * pro russian groups . 
  it is clearly a tactical win , but russia has hence managed something our leader did not achieve in many year : draft the basis of an european defense policy . 
  withouth defense and * intelligence * , many countries might be vulnerables to similar well crafted take-overs . 
  to be fair , it is almost like russia * want * to boost the european union military cooperation . 
  so they just recognised as independant two russian disctricts ? 
  putin will not like this . 
   at the very least it needs to be made clear that the next `` self-defense force '' which pops up on a russian bordering country will face immediate military response from a combined european force . 
  this is of course a political impossibility . 
  well , this kind of reaction need a little planing , and european forces need to exist for that , either in nato or in eu . 
  so we do need either to actually create an european defense , or move with nato in ukraine , wich would make russia really really angry . 
   apparently , a compromise is either not reached or not respected by current ukrainian government .
