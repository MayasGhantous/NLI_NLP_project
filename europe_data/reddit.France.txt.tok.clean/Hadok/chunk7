  the agreement called for the 2004 constitution restoration and new presidential election . 
  thoses act were voted by the parlement . 
  then yanoukovitch went awol and was not able to ratify thoses decision . 
  he was then repalced by an acting president till the new election . 
  it also should be noted that while yanoukovitch and the opposition representatives and european representative signed the document , the place for the russian representative signature is empty . 
  russia did not accept to endorse this agreement . 
   russia annexes a part of ukraine with the excuse that it is protecting people from a fascist government . 
  that part of ukraine is pro-russian ( if not mostly populated by russians ) . 
  russia annex crimea on the pretext of protecting ethnic russians out of russia , this is very worring for other aera were ethnic russian lives , namely eastern ukraine and the baltic states . 
  putin is not like hitler of course , but he is using the same moves as germany used before wwii , and many fear he will strike elsewhere soon . 
  they would be able to devellop one , but not to keep it secret . 
  i think it will be kept as a bargainin chip to stress for the importance of protection , but the part of the time when they devellop it will be hard as they will be vulnerable to russian attacks , both direct or coverts . 
  i guess he signed for both parties . 
   `` they who would give up essential liberty , to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . '', 
  thumb up for using this citation in a way similar to its original meaning for once ( and not in the snowtard one ), 
  for non-french readers , i underline that `` valointresloin '' mean `` gofarveryfar '' . 
  such an `` anti-authoritarian '' user name as you can see . 
  i think it is important to stress that these are two differents recording : * buisson had a manual record of his meeting for unknow purpose ( book , blackmail , notes ) * sarkozy phone was taped on a judiciary inquiry , and that is this affair that the right is spining . 
  ** france ** * paris is suffering from air pollution . 
  this ignited a politicla debate and hence resulted in free public transport and [ alternating traffic ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20140315-france-limit-vehicle-use-paris-amid-soaring-pollution/ ) * a former rwanda genocide perpetrator was finally [ condemned to 25 year in prison ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20140315/french-court-sentences-rwandan-over-genocide ) * the french footballer in england that made the racist gesture popularised by a french holocaust denier [ is finally quitting arsenal . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20140315/anelka-quits-west-brom-over-quenelle-fall-out ) * affair in the affair . 
  first , our president second phone was put into hearing , and a conversation with his layer allowed to discover that a judge was corrupted . 
  but the french right managed to spin this into an acusation of our justice minister for lying about her involvement in these hearing ( she pretended she didnt know about it , presenting a document where it was written that she was regulary informed about it . ), 
  * the receiver of the artificial heart died last week after 75 days .

  * french bea inquirers will go to malaysia to help locate the mh370 flight, 
  quite a good part of nuclear , but the ecologists are pressuring hard against new constructions . 
  or most likely just to buy a second car . 
  a better solution would be a london like tax . 
  well , your post is interesting to understand the russian perspective , but it show that there is no room for diplomacy . 
  if russia consider that ukraine is one 's property , the one in question being them , then there is no room for keeping both ukrainian and russian perspectives safe . 
  especially now that russia has taken a rough stance at ukraine . 
  first reason , because it is closer , and that this russian move is more threatening to central european countries . 
  second , because it is closer , and hence more easy to act . 
  third , because while russian role in georgia was assumed and while discutable clearly identified , here putin is using provocation on provocation . 
  fourth , because european countries endorsed the transition plan who called for restoration of the consitution and new elections , and are hence already somehow responsible for its outcome . 
  putin has been offered a lot of room for desecalation . 
  he dosent want any and is even carying more provocation in donesk and in southern ukraine . 
  as much as i would like a diplomatic solution there is none . 
  the economic sanction will have to do , but a military solution is needed , only this dont need to be in the form of an assault were they wait it . 
  the first step should be to help ukraine military so they would be able to answer to any russian attack . 
  i had view from only a part of the street at the time i think . 
  dont seem very massive , but the police presence around them is quite strong . 
  also here : http://newcaster.tv/15march.html, 
  it is the most logical move i have seen since the beginin of this crisis . 
  if the syrian rebellion did have even the most basic anti-air weapons , the regime would not just drop improvised [ barrel bombs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barrel_bomb ) for helicopters . 
  but ... but they say that * we * are the fascists, 
  please dont tell me that you expect we dont spy on you, 
  the call itslef has no meaning , it is one person telling an other `` olga told me that '' but the fact that olga tell that is not interesting by itslef if it is not in a conversation with two diplomats . 
  however , while there was a lot of noise about usa spying capabilities , it raise interesting question about the russian spying capacities , and the relative non indignation about it , compared to the snowden media agitation . 
  moreover , of snowden was a nsa agent , he was forced to know about russian capabilities . 
  why would he have chosen to fly here ? 
  the fact that they show them say a lot more than the fact that they are here . 
  hmmm , i see where we had it wrong now . 
  well , if you did buy all the bitcoin at their creation , they would n't be worth anything , as no other could buy and use them . 
  well , it was more that we excpected them to be reasonable and act about it in a civilised way , not with a flat out military invasion . 
   this would be very dangerous for russia itself , considering it close links with ukraine on all levels . 
  if they did want to keep goot relation with ukraine , i think they miscalculated here . 
  well , as it is more close to you , we might seem more in the way you see mexico : kind of fucked up with a lot of criminality , but at least you know them . 
  then if suddently , there was an anti castro revolution in cuba , and mexico deceided to grab the western tip of the island , i think it would be kind of similar to the situation we have here . 
  or host their bases . 
  ** france ** * the affairs around sarkozy are all stumbling on each other as judges investigating his campaign financing did find an other . 
  apparently , [ a magistrate was informing sarkozy of the sates of the investigation against him in exange for support for a post in monaco ] ( www.france24.com/en/20140307-french-judges-tapped-sarkozy-phones-gaddafi-cash-probe/ ) * moreover , we learned that one of its councellor , patrick buisson [ had the habit of recording every high level meeting .

  it is easy , [ spy for us ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20140307/spy-for-us-or-we-wont-let-you-become-french ) a russian student was said .

  to their credit , there is actually quite a lot of armed men withouth insigna in the region . 
  i 'm surprised its not rt, 
  write diplomatic messages in caps so the russian will know that we are angry !, 
   ask the ukrainians to negotiate a settlement on that basis . 
  actually , it is the russian side that is refusing any negociation . 
  to my knowledge they still consider that yanoukovitch is the legitimate president and dont recognize kiev governement . 
  they even refused to meet them in paris when we organised a meeting on the subject . 
  it is indeed . 
  i always thought we should have a military strong enough to protect ourselves from a falkland like crisis , or to support our allies , but didnt consider an integrated european army . 
  now that thing have changed , i dont find the concept of an european army so absurd . 
  i think sanction are justified , but it is a hard subject . 
  putin is very careful on that matter not to inflict to much violence in crimea ( for the moment ) as it would justify them . 
  it is a reason good enough to keep the subject on the table . 
  i doubt the sanction 's efficiency , but as i have no knowledge on that matter , and as there is a lot of bluff in both side , i really dont know if they will be efficient . 
  however , doing nothing and hoping for a desescalation is quite naive in my opinion . 
  putin has been given many opportunities do de escalate but still refuse to even negotiate with kiev . 
  on the contrary , he is reinforcing its troops , planting mines on the border and shutting tvs . 
  can we withstand the sanction ? 
  i think we have a confortable level of life and should make some efforts to reduce our dependancy from imports and debt anyway . 
  lowering the cost of working in france could give us some margin and help our economy at the same time . 
   i 've also seen on some french websites comments saying basically the same thing you saw , but the complainers are always the loudest , as you know , especially in a comment section . 
  i think most french people either do n't care ( because , as you know , people are sheep with no interest in geopolitics ) , or are for sanctions . 
  basically this , but i am quite surprised at the realtive low contestation on that matter . 
  even if it is not an armed intervention , like in libya or mali , the fact that it involve russia should have made the pro russian far right and the anti american far left quite vocal about this . 
  but after all , they must be busy with the upcoming local elections . 
  you mean the part when we include the amputated country , or the part when russia occup a part of it ? 
  because if it is the second , i have bad news for you . 
  well , we did have western germany while the eastern part was occupied by soviets, 
  fascism to me is when armed militia take control of the politics , intimidate the population , cut off opposition channels and beat journalits . 
  and you , how would you define facscism ? 
  ant goes to europe . 
  if europe did boycott it , russia would have to send it to tankers .
