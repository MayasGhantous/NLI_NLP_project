  it may also be a strategy to push ukranian to bad decisions . 
  would the eu allow it ? 
  absolutely not , they would protest it as nearly everybody . 
  but would they be able to block it ? 
  the only way to do it would be to actually place troops in ukraine , or to engage russian troops . 
  assuming that putin would be able to surprise-annex crimea and that local ukranian tropps would defect or surrender , the likely scenario would be a total break of european commercial and diplomatic relation with russia and the beginin of a new cold war . 
  we used to have some air show mixing civilian and military demonstration , but as our budget is limited and our deployement many , they tend to be very rare lately . 
  with terrorism protection , you can sometime see armed men patrol in stations and other places ( mainly in paris ) . 
  most of europe still remember the cold war when red and blue forces had active cells each trying to make their propagand , and even sometime supported terrorist . 
  not surprised is an understatement, 
  while poland is often portrayed as simple minded ( and more in a rural than in a mental way ) , other countries have a harsher treatement , especially amerifat . 
  well it is not impossible , but it would make future ukraine-russian relation extremely cold . 
  more likely , russia will support independantists movement in crimea or try to push ukraine to provoke them with covert ops . 
  it is not wasted . 
  we managed to convince them to buy f-35s and are hence getting an advantage in the future confrontation with our eternal rival ; hon hon hon !, 
  the good news here is that putin finally recognise medvedev as a member of russia governement . 
  well , then ukraine should join eu , and crimea should join usa . 
  thank you , this is a legitimate questino as we often see in civil war that the governement print money like crazy as it gave them cash while making their population poorer . 
  ohhh , this is going to end badly ... for him . 
  its just cause 2 all over again, 
   currency reserves have been halved since 2012 does this mean that yanoukovitch has been printing money like toilet paper ?

  french german and polish forgein minister are in kiev , negociating with between yanoukovitch and the opposition . 
  a though stand with yanoukovitch , but russia can understand that the more blood flow , the less they will have in common with ukraine and europe . 
  the last amnesty worked so well, 
  that one goes to china honestly . 
  between the 9/11 and snowden , we can safely say thet usa spying system is not the most efficient in the world . 
  well , if the greek governement did torture and kill dozen of protester they would not have lasted long . 
  so it seem to be between the two . 
   full media control . 
  greek public tv is very critic of the greek govnt while ukranian press is not free at all , and russian press is following putin orders . 
  it is unlikely that the ukranian army would support a such a stance to begin with . 
  some high ranking officier did send many signal that they would remain neutral and will not take action against civilians . 
  that would indicate ukranian armed force would not support a full scale assault . 
  not to boast about my country , but i think france 's armed forces fare better when we take our respective size into account . 
  well , movies for a start . 
  well , it did force assad to renounce to its chemical arsenal . 
  but when you get to the point when poison gas is used on urban target , you can safely assume the situation is broken up beyond any repair . 
   russia would never invade any european country again ftfy, 
  i am conscious , but a military intervention can not happen if there is no heavy human right violation to begin with , or that would just be an invasion . 
  on the other hand , if there is a civil war , we can support the side of the people , promote a negociated solution and deter the ukrainian army from taking action against civilain . 
  france and england would be able to intervene if human right violation are really out of hand , but diplomatic pressure and secret operation might be more complicated .

  nah , turks should be regarded as criminal by any person with a conscience in the world as they executed armenians . 
  russian should be regarded as criminals by the way they treated the chechen . 
  when israel did gain territory wich was inhabited by an hostile population , they made the error of not treating them the russian on turk way . 
  this would have caused a little commotion at first , but after that they would not be regarded as badly as turks or russians . 
  instead they let the arabs live in the territory , wich is a more human decision , but pay a heavy price for it . 
  the reason why you are indigned by the situation in the west bank were palestinian are badly paid to make soda machines and not by the syrian one were they are killed * en masse * is just becasue of the propaganda wich is aimed at making you hate israel . 
  how about you look at the literraly bigger picture . 
  israel is surrounded by hostile arab countries . 
  palestinian never really counted for the arab that had three war with israel and the ground was just considered gained or lost . 
  palestine never existed back then and it was just ground that jordan egypt and syria hoped to seize for themselves , but they failed and israel securised strategic location as golan height on the north and jordan river on the east as its borders to be ready for the next arab war . 
  they even pushed to the suez canal on the south but lost the sinai in a war with egypt . 
  israel has no goal or interest in `` opressing '' anyone . 
  their strategy was to be ready for the next arab attack . 
  well , trying to tell israel it should make peace has never worked because you never considered there was two side in this fight . 
  it is not israel who did wipe out the fatah of gaza bank , it is not israel wich is endangereing lebanon . 
  as long as the fight is fueled by arabs ( mostly out of palestine ) countries or groups it is futile . 
  of course , you are told that the israelies are the bad guys who never want peace and insist on having bad relations with all their neighbours ? 
  but is this black and white tale the truth ? 
  israel is a tiny country cornered by hostile . 
  if they had a chance at peace they would obviously seize it , who would not ? 
  but you are missing a small factor : it is not only about israel . 
  it would have even more internal opposition and act even less . 
  the question you should ask yourself is how much europe would be different if pro eu parties did well in the elections . 
  what about if somone has jesus & mo on a t-shirt , or even worse , is dressed as a pastafarian ? 
  well , the swiss can allow transit . 
  the eu can only affect the swiss in the eu , not the eu citizen in switzerland . 
  i think they will somehow allow transit but restrict residency . 
   french economist it is like saying an english cook you know . 
  the context in wich is say that , was more close to europeans deploring its lack of effectiveness than how one would damn a country . 
  and yet diplomats will be more outraged by this strong word than by the fact that eu lack of action leaded to this . 
   well the plan was to get rid of both that is only what you believed .
