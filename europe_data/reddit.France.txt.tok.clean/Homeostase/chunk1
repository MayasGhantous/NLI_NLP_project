you forgot gay and communist . 
  `` my gay trans black communist muslim friend was criticised for wearing the hijab '', 
  same over here !, 
  incidentally , [ i just wrote about that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/5c8grc/democrats_trump_and_the_ongoing_dangerous_refusal/d9us7l1/ ) ( in an admittedly more raucous way ) in the french sub . 
  i 'm glad you 've got inside information . 
  mind telling us ? 
  seriously , she feels much more like the opportunistic type to me . 
  there 's no way in hell m\u00e9lenchon 's getting a high score . 
  depends what you put behind `` succesful '' . 
  mind defining a bit ? 
  [ they love spending time in their garage . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afax293cg1c ), 
  [ perceived crime rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/numbeo ) , not actual crime rates ( whatever that would even mean ) . 
  france is the same . 
  reformulating : is he seriously saying europeans will get attacked wherever they happen to be on the globe by turkish citizens ? 
  what the fuck does he even mean ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  they 're almost a family heirloom at this point . 
   they 've acted as fn security for decades already . 
  how would you guys define `` fascist '' ? 
  if you use the narrow definition then i would also say she is n't . 
  she 's farther right that fillon , sure . 
  but not by a light-year either . 
  i was merely ( somewhat humoristically ) refuting a bogus claim . 
  admittedly , i only took the time to answer the claim in a developped fashion because as a reader of both french and british newspapers , the british obsession of french things is starting to slightly get on my nerves . 
  but you 're right for feeling the way you do !, 
  let 's enjoy the things we have . 
  i thought it was an obvious enough joke . 
  edit : btw , she 's apparently been living in great britain for more than 30 years , so the lines are a bit blurred i think . 
  and the two associations whom she 's just a member of are simple cheese lobbies which anyone who loosely works in the cheese industry can enter . 
  so your first source is a certain juliet harbutt , a british lady who organises the `` british cheese awards '' ( vested interest eh ? ), 
  and who 's called by that newspaper a `` global authority on cheese '' . . !, 
  who decided that ? 
  where does it come from ? 
  nobody knows , ca n't find any results on the interweb . 
  the article gives each cheese country an `` innovation score '' which we have no idea what it means or how it created . 
  and where do their numbers on the varieties from other countries come from ? 
  who knows . 
  i 'd wager their own bums . 
  now onto the british cheeses themselves , this sentence does n't inspire me confidence :  most of the cheeses produced fall within about 10 main families -- such as cheshire , stilton and double gloucester . 
  it kind of implies , to me , that the cheesemakers really stick to the big cheeses like stilton and cheddar . 
  10 families is not a lot . 
  especially when you have the slightiest idea of the sheer variety that exists in french cheesemaking . 
  quality over quantity , all that ...  the second source is decent enough to me for the number of english cheese varieties . 
  although like i just said , we still do n't know how much they really `` vary '' ... en garde perfidious englishman !, 
  one does not insult a frenchman 's cheeses without suffering retaliation !, 
  but you can still make it grate . 
  roquefort is absolutely amazing in a sauce ( with cream , vinegar and olive oil ) for an endive salad . 
  baked mont d'or is better !, 
  start by buying a mont d'or , a reblochon , a rocamadour , a crottin de ch\u00e8vre and a comt\u00e9 , i 'd say ... 
  if you do n't mind smelly strong ones , you can try the popular `` camembert '' . 
  i 'd like a source for that claim !, 
  he does n't even have the charisma of a damp rag . 
  i doubt it . 
  and i hope not . 
  oh , just by luck another name reappeared in the media today ; [ boris boillon ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2016/11/21/de-retour-au-quai-d-orsay-boris-boillon-est-renvoye-devant-la-justice_5035387_1653578.html ) . 
  brutal . 
  you can also check his close buddies balkany , claude gu\u00e9ant , eric woerth , rachida dati . 
  great people all of them . 
  yeah ... 
  i do n't really understand why anyone would ever downvote a question . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2016/09/05/01002-20160905artfig00131-les-affaires-judiciaires-qui-menacent-toujours-nicolas-sarkozy.php ) 's a list of judicial affairs that directly concern him , from our national right-wing newspaper ( which strongly supported him everytime ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/sarkozy-face-a-la-justice,100234 ) 's a whole category of articles from the biggest national left-wing newspaper ( not counting lemonde that 's a bit more to the center ) about the same judicial affairs . 
  all of it is in french though . 
  he 's the most corrupt president we 've ever had . 
  and we 've had a few . 
  almost all of his friends and allies are implicated as well . 
  yes he is against same sex marriage . 
  but he recognizes he ca n't go back now on that particular law . 
  i was n't referencing the american use of the word as meaning `` the stuff leftists like '' . 
  i thought brits still used the word in its classic , all-encompassing sense rather than the limited french one of `` individual freedom when it comes to economic-related stuff only '' . 
  therefore , liberalism as letting people do what they like both socially and economically . 
  i might be wrong about that then ? 
  fillon is an economic liberal ; really not a social one as far as i know his policies and his views . 
  be careful using the term `` ultra-liberal '' in english , i 'm not sure it means what you think it means . 
  gladly !, 
  i wholeheartedly disagree . 
  all left-leaning people i know who voted in these primaries chose to vote jupp\u00e9 , not fillon , who 's seen as ( way ) too right-wing to their taste . 
  reminds me i need to add one to my cities : skylines town . 
  brb, 
  you hide it well !, 
  talking about ashkenazi jews , not french people . 
  well , considering the fact that we 're mostly converted slavs it kind of makes sense ... 
  maybe they have a significant minority i know nothing about ? 
  that 's not really about being educated or not though . 
  i 'm really suprised when it comes to the german results in general . 
  i thought you guys were much more tolerant than the french . 
  and there was the whole `` welcoming culture '' thing ... gosh . 
  i wonder how it 'll be when you have our experience with the 2d and 3d generations of immigrants mostly failing to integrate . 
  o boy . 
  there should be a weekly theme or something for folk music from every european country !, 
  i was going to mention it . 
  the drug trade is a thing . 
  what 's your point ? 
  last time i checked i was n't the lone former president or prime minister of france who decided to be a part of this mess . 
  this land was only populated by georgians 4 centures ago . 
  it was majorly ( i think , not sure , i ca n't find any data about the situation before 1918 ) georgian until the ossetians attacked the georgians starting from 1918 ( hence `` ethnic cleansing separatists '' ) . 
  it still had a 1/3 georgian population despite the separatism of the ossetian part of the population not 10 years ago . 
  your analogy to `` georgia splitting off from ussr '' is hollow . 
  i 'm a european , i do n't give a fuck about the us .
