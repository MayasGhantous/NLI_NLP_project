  [ russia in a nutshell with its neighbors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvegsm0lhf8 ) . 
  it 's not like they started a hundred years ago with the ethnic cleansing of 1918 ... oh wait . 
  it 's good to know ossetians are still as good at it though . 
  it 's a useful skill to have in this globalised world i 'm sure . 
  on the same right which makes my french hometown part of france ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia why do n't you do a little reading ? 
  well , it 's their land that was stolen by russian backed ethnic cleansing seperatists . 
  i ca n't really blame them for wanting it back . 
  and a lot of french people are upset about that , including i. 
  [ askhistorians has a thread about this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/6r3w7r/recently_christopher_nolans_dunkirk_has_been/ ) `` while there 's little evidence for such a presence at dunkirk , this does n't mean they were n't there . 
  there were also four companies of mule drivers from the indian army in the pocket . 
  the merchant navy , which provided crews to many of the ships taking part in the evacuation , had 50,000 sailors from africa , china and india , compared to 132,000 british sailors . '',

  we need names !, 
  for ... research purposes . 
   this is pretty much a primary example of bad statistics . 
  not so much as a case of not detailed enough statistics imo . 
   it also is n't really relevant to the topic of discussion because the inhibitions and sexual behaviour of pedophiles might strongly diverge from the sexual behaviour of non-pedophiles well , that 's quite a statement . 
  i think the burden of proof would be on those making it . 
  anyways , we clearly need more and especially * better * studies on the subject . 
  but cases like the denmark legalization of porn in the 70s might be very interesting to look at in more detail since whatever decrease in sex crimes you could find there would not be as easily related to an economic boom as say the decrease in czech republic as it went from communism to capitalism in 1989 . 
  i 'd say you 're a bit too quick to dismiss those statistics . 
  neither should be allowed . 
  the government that allowed the sale was a different one . 
  it held different opinions . 
  i wish those ( italians ? ), 
  who are furious at macron for doing it would actually try to answer this argument . 
  there was a pretty strong negative correlation between porn accessibility and sexuals assaults/rape , last time i checked . 
  the opposite ? 
  [ for instance ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201601/evidence-mounts-more-porn-less-sexual-assault ), 
  i 'm kind of fantasizing about the idea of going on a trip alone . 
  might not be lviv ( / ukraine ) specifically , but why not !, 
  i would n't know how to prepare for it though . 
  maybe i should go look into a more appropriate sub if there 's one . 
  did you go there alone ? 
  or with some friends ? 
  it 's not like we were all supporting the ideea ... sarkozy is/was a crazy fuck . 
  yes , but it leads to [ * that * kind of fucked up shit ] ( https://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sondage-nation-contribue-defaite-nazis-1.jpg ) . 
  why are you mentioning the armenian genocide ? 
  thank you for doing this . 
  btw , you do know that american flag is n't really fooling anyone , right ? 
  were n't armenians the majority in high karabagh ? 
  and turkish cypriots the minority in the north of cyprus ? 
  the cleansing , according to my knowledge , started one century ago ( almost exactly ) and continued until more less 10 years ago ( with the 2008 war ) . 
  it 's really not that long ago !, 
  i 'm weary of this logic you ( and a lot of other people in other situations ) use here . 
  at what point does something start simpy belonging to the past and people need to `` move on '' ? 
  inbefore i get robbed , catch the thief 5 minutes later and they tell me `` it 's in the paaaast bro !, 
  move on !, 
  it belongs to me now ... '' . 
  it 's only been 10 years ffs . 
   south osetia was never georgian land to begin with my point was that you 're a lying sack of shit . 
  my point is made . 
  i 'm not even gon na start on your shitty analogy ... 
  was n't it entirely georgian until ossetians started settling there from the 17th century onward , and then ethnically cleansed the place of all actual georgian population in the 20th ? 
  i thought it was going to be about a restaurant for cats ... lol, 
  `` someone said a lie a few centuries ago , hence all things that are said today must be lies too ! '', 
  not attacking your political position , just your logic . 
  so you choose to be dishonest . 
  of course raising his hand is not the only thing he did . 
  you can also see them exchange words . 
  it 's impossible to know exactly what they 're saying to each other , but it 's safe to assume the guy gave macron a more explicit instruction . 
  look at the guy in the front ( the one with the sheet of paper in his hands at 0:07 ) . 
  he clearly shows macron where to put himself . 
  you do realize he was asked to go there ? 
  or are you that stupid ? 
  you answered your own question . 
  what makes the eu faceless ? 
  well , that it has no faces for a start !, 
  the local political level ( country ) has plenty of them ; politicians you recognize easily , that you hate or love but watch and hear talk every day in the media . 
  whereas the eu has none . 
  interesting . 
  you answer the single-sentence easiest-to-attack statement from every 3-page article and every redditor 's like `` he got him ! '' .

  yup . 
  god forbid you find information that does n't fit 100 % what 's already been said on the subject . 
  and that 's not even the end of it . 
  i remember one of my university history professors going `` please do n't research the algerian independence war . 
  it 's a minefield . 
  you get attacked from one side for being too critical of the french troops and colonials , and from the other for stating things as they were on the atrocities committed by the fln '' a friend of hers had done it and was currently dealing with lawsuits in both countries . 
  a guy just trying to do his job as a historian . 
  yeah . 
  that they are n't available to everyone , i 'm mostly okay with . 
  but that you ca n't even research the subject matter in a scientific environment i really ca n't wrap my head around . 
  that sarkozy started his private meeting with putin by making a list of all the stuff russia did that he found unacceptable . 
  and that putin managed to intimidate him in response , telling him in essence : `` you 're the new president of france . 
  that 's great , enjoy it . 
  but you 're a small player .
