  i can make or break you . '', 
  thanks . 
  that ... would make sense . 
  where are you from ? 
  if i may ask . 
  we 're still crossing our fingers ... 
  what 's your source ? 
  never heard that . 
  but yes , sarkozy does n't drink any alcohol ever , so he ca n't be inebriated in this clip . 
  that much we can agree on . 
  god . 
  this picture hurts my eyes . 
   the academics can do their research on this ( though i 'm not entirely sure how much of a bureaucracy burden is necessary ... ) . 
  they are a bit apart in the system . 
  no they ca n't . 
  no one can . 
  those academics who try to do it usually find shitty roundabout ways ( country of origin , or w/e ) . 
  that researcher had to create his own prison ethnicity statistics using the way the prisoners ' names sounded ( arabic sounding , european souding etc ) . 
  ffs . 
  that seems ... pretty damn accurate . 
   from my limited knowledge of south korea i 'm under the impression it was less protectionism and more corporatocracy and american investment that created their boom . 
  [ already discussed this here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cwqi1/eu_council_raises_eu_content_netflix_quota_to_30/dhz8uh8/ ) . 
   regardless , all you 've proved here is that heavy-handed state economic interventionism is good for developing countries to reach first world standards . 
  once they reach those standards they employ a more hands-off approach to maintain it . 
  as we are in / r/europe i doubt we 're discussing economic strategy for developing countries , so i 'd say you 've made a poor case for economic interventionism in modern western europe . 
  my point was that `` laissez faire '' is not always * the * solution . 
  sometimes it could even be detrimental to the economic health of an industry or country . 
  especially when we 're talking about an underdeveloped industry competing against already established foreign giants ( such as hollywood in this particular case ) . 
  i was illustrating the fact that protecting an industry to make sure it is allowed to grow ( and indeed become more competitive ) without getting instantly destroyed is a potentially worthwhile endeavor , even in a place like the european union . 
  there are plenty of industries which can not develop here today because they would instantly get fucked . 
  potential industries which often have no reason to be worse here than the ones in the us or wherever else . 
   it 's awfully convenient for your argument to dismiss city states as , ` not really obeying the same rules ' . 
  it 's true to some degree , but australia , new zealand and switzerland operate at a similar level of economic freedom much to their benefit . 
  basic economic laws are the same anywhere . 
  i 'm afraid not . 
  city-states like these two function as tax havens to the much bigger states surrounding them . 
  and they can only exist if those much bigger states are nearby , otherwise they would wither and die . 
  they become rich by acting literally like parasites ( that 's the appropriate term , not judgment here ) to them ; lowering their taxes to the maximum so the richest companies and individuals of the surroundings bring their resources to them . 
  it is absolutely impossible to sustain a large country 's economy this way . 
  * impossible * . 
  hence `` citystates do n't really obey the same rules '' . 
  ah yes !, 
  that one . 
  i could never remember or pronounce its name properly . 
  and yeah ... she 's got weird taste . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  edit : just googled the term and came up with this :  downvote brigading , or just brigading , is when a group of users , generally outsiders to the targeted sub or community , `` invade '' a specific subreddit or larger community and flood it with downvotes in order to damage karma dynamics on the targeted sub . 
  users can also be targeted by a downvote brigade in certain situations . 
  while it often refers to an attack that is intentionally orchestrated by the `` brigade '' , whose members consist of separate people , it 's also sometimes used to refer to sockpuppet tactics , in which people create extra user accounts for the purpose of acquiring more voting power ( this in particular is very very much against reddit rules ) , or simply an unplanned circlejerk of downvotes against a particular user or community . 
  can you therefore please substantiate your accusations ? 
  last time i checked , it was widely accepted that the korean high end electronic industry also came out of such `` infant industry protection '' policies . 
   those policies have often been the diametric opposite of the orthodoxy . 
  south korea and taiwan focused their economies on exports , but combined that outward orientation with high levels of tariffs and other forms of protection , state ownership , domestic-content requirements for industry , directed credit and limits to capital flows . 
   rodrik says : `` since the late 1970s , china also followed a highly unorthodox two-track strategy , violating practically every rule in the guidebook . 
  conversely , countries that adhered more strictly to the orthodox structural reform agenda - most notably latin america - have fared less well . 
  since the mid-1980s , virtually all latin american countries opened up their economies , privatised their public enterprises , allowed unrestricted access for foreign capital and deregulated their economies . 
  yet they have grown at a fraction of the pace of the heterodox reformers , while also being buffeted more strongly by macroeconomic instability . '', 
   this is an argument taken up by ha joon chang in a recent paper for the south centre , the developing countries ' intergovernmental forum . 
  chang argues that `` there is a respectable historical case for tariff protection for industries that are not yet profitable , especially in developing countries . 
  by contrast , free trade works well only in the fantasy theoretical world of perfect competition . '',

   croatia ca n't hope to compete with the us in content volume . 
  no it ca n't . 
  but it could maybe produce 1 % of what the us does , and well that 'd pretty good for 4 million people compared to 300m + . 
  and this law ( and others ! ), 
  could definitely help them . 
   so they should be punished by being refused access to us media products ? 
  big words . 
  `` punished '' . 
  seriously ? 
  `` being refused access to us media products ? '', 
  again ? 
  come on . 
  it 's removing a few useless shit movies from the list of what passes over the ocean . 
  it 's not the end of the world . 
  those american movies most croatians already watch would still be there . 
   i am pointing out that not everyone thinks that there should be quotas for women in parliaments . 
  what makes you think i needed you to tell me that ? 
  like . 
  o f ***** g rly . 
  that 's forgetting half the story . 
  * the * most important part of the story . 
  the one about * how * they became the freest and most successful markets in the world . 
  by implementing protectionist measures to make sure their key industries could develop without having to deal with the competition of the bigger foreign industries . 
  by having a very economically interventionist state . 
  ( edit , writing too quickly , not enough reading : talking more about south korea and taiwan since citystates do n't really obey the same rules ), 
  we should start by doing it like canada with the game industry . 
  [ united states population : 325,007,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states ) [ european union population : 510\u00a0056\u00a0011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) say again ? 
  but then people would n't be interested in netflix so much anymore ? 
  not sure it 's a good solution to them . 
  they 're trying to compete against a lot of players . 
  considering the fact that such laws already exist in france ( and probably other european countries ) for radio broadcasting ( which belongs 100 % to french companies ) , you 're objectively wrong . 
  yeah , like the train/railway industry . 
  the whole asian `` 4 tigers '' economic boom situation tends to be forgotten about by the most extreme `` free market '' activists . 
  i wonder why . 
  oh wait i do n't . 
  i do n't remember the borg assimilating this entire subcontinent and announcing that the single reddit account / u/trucidator would now represent their opinion . 
  but i guess that 's happened and i missed the memo . 
  please pardon my ignorance . 
  and if there are so few women in our parliaments , it 's because women are terrible at their jobs .
