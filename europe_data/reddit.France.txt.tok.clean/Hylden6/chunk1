could a well placed bomb cause a major nuclear disaster ? 
  it 's highly unlikely considering the security measures taken in nuclear plants . 
  i 've visited one a few weeks ago and it is reassuring to witness how seriously this is taken . 
  anyway , even in the event of an eplosive detonated inside the nuclear bloc of a plant it would most likely not impact the environment thanks to several containment blocs isolating it from the outside world . 
  oh boy yes . 
  even in those times of crisis and , let 's say `` miscommunication '' , between germany and france , i still think it 's truly amazing that we got there . 
  a little googling tells me that apparently `` harebrained '' would fit rather well indeed !, 
  i 'd never heard either of those before , thanks !, 
  well it might be true , i have no idea , but the french mod strongly [ denied it ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/proche-orient/article/2014/10/06/syrie-un-ancien-agent-de-la-dgse-passe-a-al-qaida_4500918_3218.html ) and went as far as saying that those claims were `` silly '' ( * farfelues * , if someone has a better translation ... ) . 
  according to `` a source inside the mod '' : `` this frenchman does exist , but is neither a former secret services angent nor even an ex-military ; to our knowledge he has only physically trained with former members of the french military '' . 
  this is both preposterous and insulting , especially in the light of the [ recent events ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29352537 ) . 
  what 's the organization that dares to publicly support such a shocking way of `` downsizing '' the military ? 
  a weird , isolated political party ? 
  do n't tell me it 's a mainstream organization ... 
  10/10 , would climb on top of . 
  haha indeed !, 
  i guess i have n't mastered posting from mobile yet ... [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/23/arms-export-licences-russia-pm-embargo-report ) it is !, 
  hundreds of job , and a reputation on the global stage . 
  the latter being rather important when it comes to signing defence contracts that will ( or wo n't ... ) be honoured * years * later , giving time to the political landscape to evolve a lot . 
  exactly . 
  reputation has a very strong meaning in international business , and a far greater when in comes to international arms business . 
  in addition to this , wether we like it or not , putin remains [ a force to be reckoned with ] ( https://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.slate.fr%2fstory%2f89437%2fmistral-gagnant-pour-poutine&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) when it comes to international negotiations ... 
  we * love * being pessimistic almost as much as being self-deprecating , which is imho one of the absolute biggest annoyances with french people . 
   no information on parties , candidates etc. 
  you have to go out and find it all yourself . 
  well , then the situations on both sides of the rhine are comparable . 
  how sad for the eu , how lucky for extremists and eurosceptics . 
  i do n't know about germany , but here i 'm afraid people will use this european election as an i-don ` t-like-the-current-government-policy-and-then-i 'll - vote-for-the-far-right-to-show-it-to-them election ... 
  they do n't broadcast in germany either ? 
  i 've stumbled upon [ that ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/french-tv-will-not-air-eu-commission-presidency-debate-301775 ) yesterday and started getting depressed , knowing that maybe 1 % of french people will watch it online and the others not at all , but if it 's the same in germany , i may switch from being depressed to anxious ... 
   i do n't think most people understand how offensive it is exactly !, 
  i 've always been baffled at the way americans ( not all americans * of course * , but the ones prone to the french surrender `` jokes '' ) have a huge respect of the us army and its veterans , the way they `` thank for service '' soldiers they meet , get ( rightfully ) offended when someone makes a ( stupid and ill-informed ) joke on us soldiers ( or worse , on vietnam or 9/11 , even more stupid and insulting ) , but feel no shame whatsoever when it comes to thrash-talk the french army , its soldiers and veterans ... 
  it saddens me because most of the time it 's a result of misinformation/fox news-style brainwashing ... 
  paris itself is home to 2 + million people , but paris + its immediate suburb is more like 12 + million . 
  `` suburb '' is not used here in the us `` posh '' meaning but in the more `` i ca n't afford to live * in * paris , but i still work there , so i live just next to it . '', 
  that means that those roughly 10 million people who live in the suburbs still have to go to and from paris everyday to work , that 's the big source of pollution ( see [ boulevard p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/boulevard_p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique_de_paris ) - french wikipedia 'cause more pictures than the en article ) . 
  as for the prestige of having your own car , it 's not ( imho ) true here , it 's more due to the fact that the paris train system is one of the most crowded in europe ( 4.13 million passengers/day in 2011 ) so it 's not reaaally agreeable during the peak hours ... 
  he 's been [ so mysterious ] ( http://www.slate.fr/story/78682/est-ce-que-sarkozy-va-revenir ) about it for so long ... 
  thanks !, 
  and those four networks are own and operated by those same four companies , each one having its `` native '' region where it is very well implanted and renting its network to the others , should they manage to convince people there to turn to them ? 
  just curious , who 's the big player on the energy market in germany ? 
  is there a clear number one , similar to edf 's quasi-monopoly over here , or is it a more populous market ? 
  is it e.on ( just trying , it 's the only german one i know ; ) ) ? 
  exactly , i 'd like to have a german insight on that as well . 
  is it `` only '' ( not really appropriate here but i ca n't find a better way ) because of the risks of accident and fukushima 's recent catastrophe ? 
  because if you deem those as contained ( as far as possible ) , coal plants are maaassively more co2-emitting than nuclear plants are n't they ? 
  the current edition ( the 9 ^ th , the first having been published in 1694 and having been dedicated to the king ... ) of the sole official dictionnary of the french language is still in debate and not published in full . 
  they started publishing it from `` a '' in the 80s , and as of november 2012 ( could n't find more recent sources ) they were at the word `` recez '' . 
  `` fun '' fact : it is published in the * journal officiel * , the same channel as new laws and official nominations ( ministers and stuff ) . 
  wikipedia :[ very short article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dictionnaire_de_l%27acad%c3%a9mie_fran%c3%a7aise ) in english / [ complete article ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/dictionnaire_de_l%27acad%c3%a9mie_fran%c3%a7aise ) in french, 
  ah , finally !, 
  has a week really started until it has its own `` omg france is such a warzone/shithole/decadent place '' british article ? 
   to be fair , would n't per-capita or some weighted metric like that be more interesting ? 
  i mean , france is also one of the larger countries in the eu . 
  very true . 
  and the second biggest contributor to the budget , after germany - both countries being net contributors to the eu budget . 
  but this kind of fact-based approach is rarely heard over whining about how france is showered in money through the cap . 
  just to be clear , i 100 % disapprove the action of these farmers ( especially against other farmers !, 
  ) , however it 's quite tiresome to hear the same complaints about the cap over and over again every fucking time farming in the eu is mentioned . 
  death penalty in france has been enforced with the guillotine [ until the very end ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_france ) . 
  the last execution was in 1977 , chilling ... 
  however all of these beheadings were not politically motivated - like during the revolution and its aftermath - as haxterix precised . 
  [ it 's done !, 
  ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20150410-india-france-french-36-rafale-jets-modi/ ) not 63 though , but they stated that this deal was separate from the ( much ) bigger contract still in negotiation , so we 'll see ... 
  considering the way the question is put i guess this is more to be interpreted as `` i do n't particularly look forward to christmas because i do n't care that much '' rather than `` i hate it '' . 
  the embargo was lifted in france in 2002 , so 3 years after the eu embargo . 
   the government also operates based on consent of the people ( well , it tries ) - by shifting public opinion in favor of russia will eventually either force the current government to adopt those policies or loose elections well i had not thought about it like that , interesting indeed . 
  however - i should have mentioned it in my first comment - canal + is a niche channel considering it 's subscription-based and quite expensive ( 40 $ / m ) . 
  i could n't find a reliable number of subscriptions , but i think it would hardly be enough to sway the opinion . 
   i find it despicable to produce documentaries/reporting intentionally skewed to some pre-defined narrative that runs contrary to the real events agreed , no excuse there . 
  i 'm pretty curious to hear their reasons for running that kind of content . 
  sadly , i suspect it 's the fact that it 's `` controversial '' , and therefore can potentially attract more viewers than `` yet another documentary on the crimean conflict '' ... 
  canal + is a 100 % private channel and its main shareholder is known to be close to our former president ( meaning : not so close to the current one , who 's on the other side of the political spectrum ) . 
  it is delusional to imagine that what canal + decides to broadcast is influenced by the government . 
  haha how come i had never heard of that , it 's amazing . 
  you can tell it 's yet another example of delusional dreams of expansions , and , still , they feel like they can justify it by `` objective '' geography-based arguments . 
  bonus points awarded for melodramatic speeches :  the limits of france are marked by nature , we will reach reach the four corners of the horizon , to the edge of the rhine , to the edge of the ocean , to the edge of the pyrenees , to the edge of the alps . 
  the boundaries of our republic must be there . 
  you mean the victim can not refuse because the deal is cut between the prosecutor and the suspects ' lawyers ? 
  do you know if there is a reason for that ? 
  and if this applies only to a certain type of crime ( rape/sexual harrasment ) or to all ? 
  i agree , but i still think we can not completely eradicate this phenomenon locally ( in the eu ) only . 
  we have to detect and neutralize the cells which are already set up over here , but we also have to suppress the allure of these groups and the poisonous narrative they spread from over there . 
  we know this is not possible without a - relatively - stable government in syria , the question is : is this achievable with the assad family still in command ? 
  yep i agree that having to deal with cameron is usually quite the diplomatic exercise/torture for any french and german politician , but in that case he seems to be very willing to join the military op in syria ( as he was since the beginning before getting denied by the house of commons iirc ) . 
  yep obama is tomorrow , merkel on wednesday , renzi and putin on thursday . 
  hollande will also meet with the commonwealth on friday and ban ki-moon , xi jiping and justin trudeau on sunday , but apparently these two days will be more climate-focused [ [ source ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/article/2015/11/22/coalition-contre-l-ei-francois-hollande-entame-une-semaine-diplomatique-intense_4815150_4809495.html ) ] . 
  we 'll see about assad though , because even though him leaving is `` not the priority anymore '' to speak like the elys\u00e9e 's communication people , i have a feeling neither hollande nor fabius nor obama are ready to let that go . 
  it 's gon na be interesting to see if/how each of these leaders weighs in . 
  not really , he already met with tusk and cameron at the beginning of the week , and will meet with merkel and renzi ( as well as obama and putin ) at the end . 
  but i agree with / u/thomanou that there should be an actual coordinated eu stance on that , and not just words of support and sympathy . 
  we 'll see at the end of the month if things start to get moving in that way ... 
  this is such an idiotic and polarizing way to put it , how can juncker not see how controversial it 's gon na get ? 
  of course france should not get any `` special deficit rule treatment '' ( just listen to how that sounds ! ) . 
  but in the meantime , the rest of the union should n't just be all `` go get 'em tiger '' with the french armed forces ( and its cash btw ) as soon as there 's a conflict threatening the union or its reputation . 
  i mean , at some point we 're gon na have to talk about a common defense policy/budget , it 's completely unreasonable to just hope for the support of the us and not adequate to the rank we wish to have in world affairs . 
  since the french and british military are the heavyweights in the eu , and since the uk is out of any such initiative - and i am extremely disappointed by that because i think we are basically the 2 countries that would have the least issues agreeing on operations considering our shared past and similar ( colonial ) history - we indeed are in a particuliar position . 
  i am not saying that we should get a free pass for defence expenditures , but it is about time that we discuss about that . 
   the riots we see everytime there is a little bit of globalization or competition well , it sure looks like you 're getting your news from balanced and level-headed sources .
