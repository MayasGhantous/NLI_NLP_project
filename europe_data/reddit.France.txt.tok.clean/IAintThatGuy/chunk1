i 'm a guy , but i 've seen that in france people who claim to be super open minded about that are suddenly less so when their teenage daughter starts dating a black or arab guy . 
  i 'm french , and my opinion is that there 's a lot of difference between what people will say ( or feel ) they 'd be ok with those things , and the reactions they 'd actually have when faced with those issues . 
  especially the questions about dating blacks/muslims . 
  [ so they just dusted a few old laws and changed ethnicities around ] [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuremberg_laws#classifications_under_the_laws ), 
  the one about boys is a separate sign in flemish . 
  ah now there 's a real dick move . 
  in france , this power is used more as a threat ( like if things get rough and the legislative chambers risk passing an abortion of a law , the president says something like `` i might not sign it '' , and usually it 's a message to go back to square one and fix their bill ) . 
  so there 's some tradition behind it , and has n't been abused afaik . 
  now the president who finds loopholes in the constitution to tell everyone else to go fuck themselves , that takes balls . 
  that dude is an asshole but you 've got ta give him that : he does n't let shame keep him from doing whatever he wants . 
  same in france . 
  the president has the ultimate power to refuse to sign any law . 
  it 's rarely ( if ever ) used though . 
  because the people who usually are very vocal on every issue ( leftists , feminists ) support them in this case . 
  and the right wing does n't dare attack them on that too much ( because there 's nothing to gain there ) . 
  i mean they 'll talk shit about his marriage , age difference , whatever ... 
  most people hate his politics , his personality , and so on anyway , i 'm not questioning that . 
   i must admit i have a hard time picturing him as a victim though , but i might be biased . 
  he 's a powerful man and you see him full grown at the top of his game . 
   i agree it 's creepy and should n't be encouraged . 
  but then again , i also think , after more than 20 years you could look back and maybe think that we really have a rare exception from the rule here . 
  it 's a big issue to me because it might encourage all sorts of creeps out there . 
  the important point is that creeps always think they 're justified . 
  and seeing that kind of story in a positive light might push some 40yo dude to make unwanted advances on a 15yo who 'll probably be terrified , and even worse might progress into an abusive relationship that might last for years . 
  so i 'm not saying let 's get the torches and pitchforks , but how about firm verbal reminders that it 's not ok , and the fact that they did n't face consequences is n't normal . 
  and that their relationship started in a very problematic way . 
  that 's what 's pissing me off right now : the same people who want to call out everything problematic in society ( billboard for a gym with a thin woman , not enough people of this or that color on tv , rape culture ... ) are fawning over this `` perfect love story '' . 
  meanwhile they 'll still talk shit about people like trump ( who at least waited for his wife to be over 18 , and was never her teacher ) . 
  i really do n't doubt it , and i do n't question their happiness . 
  but that 's the issue with grooming young people . 
  most relationships with an adult and a minor , plus a power dynamic ( his teacher ) should n't be encouraged , and there are legal and moral limitations put on it to prevent predators from abusing it . 
  on a personal level i think some people might have enough maturity , maybe one in a million relationship with a difference in power can be `` legit '' , where the potential `` predator '' actually cares . 
  but we need to draw a line . 
  and not just start defending people whenever they look good together or whatever , but maybe the next `` couple '' that starts that way is subjected to public scorn and maybe legal consequences . 
  as long as people defend that ( especially the part with statutory rape in it ) i 'll call it out afaic . 
  i 've worked in education . 
  people who do that shit are the absolute worst . 
  i 'm french . 
  legal age of consent is 15 . 
  ** but ** anything with a minor becomes statutory rape if you have any kind of authority over them ( and this notion of `` authority '' is n't well defined ) . 
  for instance , if you 're 40yo , and have a 15yo student , you ca n't have sex . 
  but if you wait until after they 're not your student , and they 're still 16 or 17 it could be argued that you still have some kind of authority . 
  other cases where it 's tough to determine are for instance when it 's an old friend of your family ( does n't have authority per se , but since they 've been an adult in a child 's life they still have more influence than a random other adult ) . 
  now for grooming a minor , it 's a whole different issue . 
  if the grooming includes overt sexual references it might be easier to prove . 
  if it 's just about fostering emotional dependence ( in a way that might seem proper , but with sexual after thoughts ) good luck proving it . 
  i do n't doubt it . 
  even grooming a teenager might be legal in france to be honest . 
  but it 's pretty unethical and immoral . 
   why do you think macrons wife can have a younger husband without him being a trophy at the time they started , he was more a `` felony husband '' than a `` trophy husband '' . 
  dude their relationship started when he was 15 and her 40 , and his teacher . 
  if 40yo trump had courted a 15yo and then married her , we 'd never hear the end of it . 
   what does mrs macron have that a wealthy handsome young ( ish ) man would want ? 
  she groomed him at 15 when she was his teacher . 
  that helps . 
   much older like 17 . 
  she groomed him when he was a 15yo kid ( she was 40yo , married , had children , and was his teacher , 2 years later she dropped everything to `` officially '' be with him when he turned 17 ) . 
   brigitte is probably not into men older than her . 
  and certainly not misogynist crybabies older than her . 
  yeah she 's more into 15yo kids that are her students . 
   but one was a sincere democrat , `` sincere '' as long as you totally ignore what the usa were doing in south america under him ( and not just that ) . 
  you guys are just better at it , we 're jealous . 
   after the macron mania we 're gon na get back to bashing france the president who authorized it was macron 's direct `` ancestor '' ( mitterand was from the `` parti socialiste '' , fran\u00e7ois hollande 's party , and formerly macron 's before he created his own just before the elections ) . 
  made me laugh out loud . 
  and you might be right about which issue people on both sides care more about . 
  even without another blast , yes it was his fault . 
  whatever the ( unknown ) reason for an explosion ( mechanical failure , criminal act , unsafe chemicals ... ) rule number one is to fuck off because you do n't know if the reason for the explosion wo n't cause another ( or several others ) . 
  same for fire : unless you 're a trained first responder , you evacuate , no exceptions . 
  plus they were totally developing a bomb to use only within their own borders and would never think of dropping it over civilian targets / s, 
  in france several political party and unions got caught taking orders and money from moscow when several communist countries fell ( and some archives were opened ) . 
  of course the people in question deny it to this day . 
  i wish i had a time machine and a collection of prints of all the email scams i 'm receiving . 
  as a wannabe con artist , i wish i knew him personaly . 
  i hope he does n't go into politics . 
  that would make the rest of the story so boring . 
  should have imported a woman from congo . 
  he 'd only have paid for postage , and even then he could have put her on a boat carrying rubber . 
   i really doubt this guy was doing any worse than the other colonial possessions in africa . 
  my family comes in part from french colonies , have horror stories about it passed from generation to generation , but it does n't come close to stories of the congo . 
  in his defense , that place was crazy dangerous . 
  people chopping limbs left and right over bullshit !, 
  you mean the vegan war veteran wannabe painter guy ? 
  does n't seem so bad . 
  but i have n't covered history after 1930 yet . 
   there 's his pathetic affair with an underaged whore being pimped to him by a sleasy french guy . 
  that 's where you know he was n't a good businessman . 
  he fucked up the congo , and he rented this whore until he was ruined , when buying would have made much more sense . 
  or he 's just mainstream in america . 
  which is strange for an artist . 
   basically allowing a gun used in a crime to be tracked to its source ( and the parts tracked to their sources ) , this will make it much riskier/more difficult for vendors and modification shops to do `` side-work '' . 
  yep except guns used for crimes usually come from the balkans . 
  in france ( with the right permits ) we can get anything that is n't full auto ( even some stuff that would require atf forms and months of waiting in the usa ) . 
  but criminals ** still ** prefer to use imports from the balkans , that come through our borders , and are impossible to track . 
  plus the tracking of guns is already done ( afaik ) by every country that allows gun ownership in the eu . 
  you ca n't buy ( legally ) anywhere without at least valid id , that is registered at the store , and the registration going to a national database . 
  the only thing this european directive will do is make it harder and more expensive for people who legally own guns , and will change nothing for criminals ( who were already supplying themselves away from the legal circuit ) . 
  i worked in a lab at the time . 
  interesting to see a thing so unanymously hated and considered offensive by all our female colleagues . 
  to be fair my college had a track in their chemistry degree oriented towards the cosmetics industry . 
  with a good scientific level , good contacts in the industry , students getting interesting internships .
