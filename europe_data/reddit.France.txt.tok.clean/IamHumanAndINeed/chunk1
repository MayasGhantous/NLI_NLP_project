`` the times '' , well i 've read enough of it to know this is bs . 
   chopin arrived in paris in late september 1831 ; he would never return to poland ... receiving french citizenship in 1835 ... he never considered himself to be french , despite his father 's french origins , and always saw himself as a pole . 
  i will never listen to your beautiful music chopin , you hear me ? 
  here is my top 10 by order of appearance ( more or less )  * ** vercingetorix ** , france did not exists back then but whatever , great dude !, 
  * ** charlemagne ** , `` charles the great '' was an old conqueror . 
  we wrote song about him https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5aaakcozeg . 
  * ** jacques cartier ** , explorer . 
  father of qu\u00e9bec . 
  * ** ren\u00e9 descartes ** , mathematician , philosopher . 
  died in sweden because the swedish queen chick wanted private lessons whereas the guy was sick ... * ** gilbert du motier ** , marquis de lafayette . 
  great hero who saved the us . 
  but sadly he always looks like a douche in the paintings : / * ** napol\u00e9on bonaparte ** , this guy was riding dinosaurs , fucking dinosaurs man !, 
  * ** lous pasteur ** , great scientist , even invented words like `` pasteurization '' and everything ... * ** charles de gaulle ** , some dude speaking on the radio in the last ww . 
  * ** simone de beauvoir ** , well i needed a woman and she was the first i found when i googled `` famous french '' . 
  * ** zinedine zidane ** , talented footballer who headbutted some italian in the 2006 worldcup ...

  wtf france , i 'm disappointed ... 
  loved these cartoons when i was a kid . 
  i have found memories of them . 
  the interior of this castle must have been quite windy , 
  clearly the coolest one i have ever seen . 
  we all know about wwii and how it came to be , but it 's not by sermoning people like this that it 's going to change anything . 
  go clean your churches of the pedophiles that lived in it first . 
  every 5 years , some dude tells everyone he is going to change everything . 
  people vote for him and get f *** ed over for 5 years . 
  deport them to pakistan !, 
  wait , british you said ? 
  lol at the u.k. , 
  with what military ? 
  since the `` coup '' the turkish army took a hit , it 's not as ready as it was and wo n't be if you put the wrong people in charge of it . 
  we do n't need more people , it 's already too crowded !, 
  french are going to protest this , mark my words :d, 
  what the hell is that globe ? 
  does it represent poland as a continent ?

  never seen in the outskirts of paris ? 
  it 's truly the most beautiful thing you will witness in your life . 
  large building housing thousand of people who ca n't afford living elsewhere . 
  hopefully welfare prevent them from trying to hard and find a job . 
  so they have to occupy themselves killing people at night . 
  lol that 's savage !, 
  busted !, 
  good , but i still would not get into that water unless i can see what 's at the bottom . 
  looks like paris and madrid settlers made the choice !, 
  housing is going to be more expensive in the city . 
  on another scale look at san francisco . 
  rich people coming in , can afford to pay higher than the market value . 
  seems quite dangerous for the cows if they happened to fall into the river . 
  good for the eu . 
  bad for the modest/poor people living in frankfurt ^ ^, 
  the earth is tired of us and preparing its reboot , 
  we should settle migrant camps around it and let them deal with it , 
  lord gulen is the only rightful heir to the throne , erdogan is an impostor !, 
  oh sorry wrong sub , 
  you ca n't stop stupidity . 
  let them die on their holy fucking land of stupidness . 
  i 'm actually impressed by my country . 
  with all the strikes and nonchalance we managed to beat the u.k. ^ / s, 
  `` tonight , we dine in hell ! '', 
  italy , unleash everything !, 
  once the situation will be unbearable for everyone , the eu is going to transform into something new . 
  we have not reached the bottom yet , keep your seat belt on .

  lmao !, 
  when it come to nationalism , japanese knows a thing or two :p, 
  nice to see macron and trump smiling . 
  and why is there e.t. 
  at the table ? 
  only history will tell . 
  i hope his presidency will end soon and be forgotten . 
  unbelievable , this kind of mob phenomenon is getting more and more common . 
  it 's going to end up with a dead douchebag and the police is going to be the culprit ... 
  i 'm so embarassed for trump watching this , how someone can be so childish ? 
  it seems trump enjoyed the tanks parade better :p, 
  when i think about it , people born in this time period got it really bad compared to us ... 20 years after wwi , the casualties were people you could still relate to . 
  and you were about to start a new one which will be even worse : /, 
  not again ffs !, 
  did not say we were ungrateful for that . 
  even if we were welcoming 10 millions migrants each year it would take decades to reach china/india level of population . 
  we are safe after all . 
  well he is not wrong , africa has a demographic problem and not a lot of its countries can handle it . 
  hopefully i will be dead by that time , 
  well those green peace terrorist were going to stand by a nuke test area . 
  they got off easy i would say , they should thank our commandos !,
