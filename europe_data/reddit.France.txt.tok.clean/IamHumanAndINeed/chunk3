  there is without uncertainty predators in profession close to children . 
  you will find this in any country but as you pointed out the uk had a lot of scandals released to the public . 
  what is more relevant in this discussion is the scale of it more than anything . 
  all of this because the authority ( police/social workers ) and media did n't brought this to the light because they did n't want to be branded as racists until it reaches these disgusting proportions . 
  this is a cultural trait of the uk -  do n't talk about anything that might be regarded as racism ( the whole package with religion and everything ) if wrongly interpreted . 
  ok ... well now , i need to see that merkron in a montage !, 
  it 's cultural . 
  they are used to this in their country of origin . 
  people fails to see that as a cultural trait . 
  obviously not everyone behave the same in one big country like pakistan but in the most rural area where some of these men come from it can be pretty hardcore . 
  and yet britain is the one building walls and fences on french soil to stop these poor people to reach it . 
  do you think the response would be any different if asked in your country ? 
  people do n't want unregulated immigration like we are seeing nowadays where it 's just boat after boat after boat without fixing the issues at the source . 
  do n't you want more free kebab shop in poland ? 
  2 muslim nations . 
  which means more problems for us than just people . 
  people with ideals far away from ours . 
  we are talking of state grade malware , you ca n't be protected against that . 
  every time i see the eiffel tower when walking from a street nearby where i live , i 'm telling myself `` hey , it 's the eiffel tower '' !, 
  then i try to remember the last and only time i went on it when i was 9 or 10 ... 20 years ago ... 
  instead i 've the luxury to see beggars and smells the piss and shit in the subway ... everyday for the last 9 years or so ... 
  i 'm living the dream . 
  do n't judge , it 's a cultural thing you ca n't understand . 
  i prefer to see the people of the states in this polandball . 
  government are often short-sighted and do not reflect what the whole population think . 
  i would have been surprised if they had voted for le pen lol, 
  my favorite polandball , 
  username checks out , 
  can french be the official language of europe now ? 
  please ... 
  the rumor is that it wo n't be s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royale . 
  and this is why we need the eu . 
  otherwise we would be stepped on all the time ... well less likely , our politicians at brussels can still be bought , 
  no one should be force into a religion at young age .

  i agree , she totally missed her chance to present anything but invective towards macron . 
  but she was there not just for the presidency , but she was positionning her and her party as rightful opposition to the future macron presidency , since both traditionnal parties from the left and right got hit really hard during this election . 
  sad time . 
  they could learn french instead , 
  the situation can still get worse . 
  you could be asked to cry on command like the north koreans :d, 
  yeah , it 's going to be expensive and you still think you wo n't have to pay for anything ? 
  think again , brussels is going to bleed you dry !, 
  ( we need mor money ) . 
  like how the kids wants to play with it , until one is almost taken by it , 
  could we stop posting articles with bearded `` terrorist '' asian men ?

  it 's really a shame they live in hell with us . 
  it happens really quickly ... really scary considering this guy must be under constant protection . 
  but they are against fascism so they are the good guys right ? 
  the more disturbing , is the presence of `` camp '' in the party 's name . 
  knowing all the money the smuglers are making thanks to this , i want to vomit . 
  first time i heard about this specialty , what is it made with ? 
  yeah , he should have stayed quiet until the end . 
  when you are that unpopular , you ca n't risk upsetting people with your vote advice . 
  the real question is , do they have ftth over there ? 
  so advanced it overflowed :p, 
  sorry , let me rephrase :  poor kid , ** ve ** wo n't get a nice start : /,

  poor kid , he wo n't get a nice start : /, 
  well ... another beautiful mind who knows best . 
  stop telling people what to do . 
  it does have ** pros ** and ** cons ** , yeah . 
  it depends on whom you ask . 
  if you believe that only the rich people will want to move to greece , good for you .

  slavic girls are the hottest . 
  sure , more immigration to a strong economically country like greece can only be a good thing . 
  we can almost see her drop a load on this picture , 
  they should plug him to something so we can have free energy forever !,

  she was gay and her best guess was to hide in istanbul ? 
  hopefully she did n't go full retard and go to chechnya . 
  when charlemagne will raise from his grave to save us all . 
  it sure is going to be closer than the 2002 election . 
  but i do n't believe le pen could get more than 40 % , that number seems way too high , i expect more like 30-35 % .
