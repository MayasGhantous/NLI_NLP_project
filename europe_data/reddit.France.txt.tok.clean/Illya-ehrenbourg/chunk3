  holy roman empire however is much worse , tone of free cities , duchies , bishoprics . 
  even after 2000 hours of eu4 i am not sure i would be able to place them accurately on a 1444 map ( and eu4 simplified the real situation a lot ), 
  - thanks to eu4 i know about the world hakapelite , the finland cavalry . 
  - sisu means courage/gut/resilience - language is close to eesti and karelian , also same language group as hungarian ( finno ugric group ), 
  people always forgetting lollards , cathars , hussites :-(, 
  exemple d'un de ses rapports trouv\u00e9 au pif : http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rap-info/i3317.asp, 
  but he claims he is not catalan !, 
  til that they were the same city . 
  essentially know ratisbonne as being the late siege of the holy roman empire diets . 
  influence of the knights of livonia ? 
  i am surprised by your good , guess my image of a kind and fat italian mama is wrong lol . 
  yep members such as goulard or sarnez were deputy of alde . 
  oh really ? 
  a european deputy with 15 years of international experience who speaks fluently 4 languages as the minister of armies a physician and professor of medicine as minister of health the president of the university of nice sophia antipolis as high education and research a 2 gold medal olympic champion as minister of sport one director of the biggest ngo dedicated to the help of disabled person as minister of the disabled people president of the biggest public transport group in \u00cele de france ( ratp ) as minister of transports etc. . . nope , those female ministers are among the most capable we can possibly find . 
  it is true that during sarkozy 's presidency there were incompetent women coming from ethnic minority in some ministry but definitely not this time . 
  - no tech transfert for qatar and egypt - as for india , the transfert of technology was strictly limited , nothing to do with the initial demands of the indians . 
  safran will help to improve the engines of the indians tejas , but they are and still will be very far from having te competence to build a rafale by themselves . 
  the deals are good , especially that in the recent years with the end of the cold war , the client are more and more exigent and often require huge offset of their investment . 
  overall a promising government i would say ( many members of the civil society ) obviously we still have to wait the election of the parliament to see if this government will last or not . 
  - bayrou has been the defender of a `` moralization of public life '' reform since 2012 ( which is absolutely necessary in france , fillon was just the scapegoat of the deputy , appointing family members and nepotism in general or using legislative assistant as personal employee is really common and sadly was well used to be largely accepted ) - would have prefer a swap between le drian and goulard , the former has made a fantastic job as defense minister ( and managed to sell the rafale abroad , at last ! ), 
  while goulard is a polyglot europhile and has a long experience as a european deputy but not so much in the army, 
  it only includes major wars of the original members . 
  france used to have such a party ( the udf , former president giscard d'estaing was from this party . 
  nowadays it is led by bayrou ) but since the end of the 90 's the conservative party slowly drained the politicians and the voters until it represented almost nothing today . 
  translation : in spite of appearances , which would suggest a europe dominated by a conquering germany , the merkel-holland relationship was much less unbalanced than it seems . 
  the balance of franco-german relations at the end of francois hollande 's five-year term offers two different readings . 
  on the one hand , we can see a conquering germany that has taken the ascendancy over france . 
  indeed , because of its economic and industrial success , its position as the dominant power of the european union while france continued its decline , chancellor angela merkel endorses the leadership of this club of heterogeneous nations to which she intends to impose her economic model . 
  in this logic , francois hollande would have done nothing else in the last five years but to submit to the liberal policies of berlin , imposing to his country austerity economic policies and reduction of social gains . 
  a vision cynically expressed by marine le pen who , apostrophising the french head of state in october 2015 , on the day of his visit to the european parliament of strasbourg , had referred to him as `` vice-chancellor of angela merkel , administrator of the province france '' , german empire way . 
  ** a balanced relationship ** on the other hand we can also see a more balanced relationship between the two leaders . 
  paradoxically , germany has probably never changed as much in its european policy as in the last five-year period . 
  on monetary policy first . 
  deeply attached to the rule and spirit of the maastricht treaty , which forbids any pooling of debts within the euro zone , the german government has rallied - unwillingly - to the arguments of governor mario draghi who launched in january 2015 a massive program - 1,000 billion euros - of buyback of public debt . 
  ** investment recovery ** by the was , it will be noted that the stopping of the austerity and the revival of the investment demanded by fran\u00e7ois hollande at the beginning of his mandate have become - too late regret some - a european reality . 
  european leaders signed last september the doubling of the juncker plan which in 2015 provided more than 300 billion investments over three years . 
  focusing on deleveraging and structural reforms , germany is now convinced that the return of growth is the priority objective . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande also played a decisive role in winning the support of angela merkel in the greek crisis . 
  the chancellor had to override the recommendation of its powerful finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , who favored a temporary exit of athens from the euro area . 
  germany has also evolved over its trade policy : traditionally hostile to any protectionist measure to the extent that it has sacrificed part of its solar panel industry for the benefit of chinese enterprises , berlin has gradually europe to acquire more effective anti-dumping instruments . 
  ** germany gets involved in european defense ** finally , germany , which had always been uninterested in european defense , relying on nato to protect its territory if necessary , decided to become involved in favor of european strategic autonomy . 
  france 's intervention in mali against jihadists , a potential threat to europe , and then the annexation of crimea by russia have decided the chancellor to play the card of security and cooperation with france . 
  `` we built mutual trust and led some battles together , '' angela merkel said , remembering the long night of negotiating a peace deal with francois hollande in february 2015 with vladimir putin and ukrainian president poroshenko . 
  this event sealed their complicity . 
  francois hollande is not the only artisan of this rebalancing of the european strategy of germany . 
  the economic crisis , the growing global instability , also have their share . 
  but to say that the outgoing president was manipulated by his main partner would be false as well as unjust . 
  well we are before u.k. 
  perfectly fine result !, 
  well they are just sending diplomatic insults , that 's okay, 
  please inform yourself before telling bullshit . 
  there is a [ referendum ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_caledonian_independence_referendum,_2018 ) that will take place in new caledonia, 
  a few years ago i got ukrainian dating site ad after i spent to much time reading about the donbas and crimean conflict . 
  let 's play a game , try to understand the title as a non italian speaker !, 
   `` stupro pi\u00f9 odioso se commesso da profugo '' odiose -  look like the spanish word odiar ( hate ) profugo -  come from latin word profugio : escape commesso -  looks like commettre/commit so i guess the news is about a crime of hate committed by/against a refugee ? 
  i still remember after your parliament voted against bombing in syria while france agreed to follow obama , france suddenly became the `` oldest ally of the us '' . 
  nope , bush visited mexico first , obama canada ( well at least the queen is english ) and trump to israel and saudi arabia . 
  it is a tradition since de gaulle and adenauer that each time a president or a chancellor is elected , his or her first foreign trip is to germany and france respectively ... 
  right !, 
  notice that the french legislative are not proportional ones and are territorial elections . 
  they are 2 turn elections and traditionally the extreme parties have disappointing scores as people are frightened of them . 
  as a result , it would n't be surprising that the socialist party gets way more seats than melenchon 's party . 
  iirc , spain used to have a very generous fiscal policy toward green energy and especially solar energy but it was just to expensive and the 2008 crisis forced the country to stop this . 
  well i am not sure the average france would fare really better so not going to laugh ... 
  the protestant reformation, 
  actually i find that they are doing relatively good , just look at china . 
  with the recent fast economic boom and the emergence of a middle and superior class , there is a huge discrepancy between those who earn less than 1 dollar per day and those who could take advantage of the economic growth . 
  to be fair it 's not that uncommon , see the clinton in the us or the nehru dynasty in india . 
  another proof that finland  netherlands, 
  yep the soviet 2nd tank army ( or what remains of it after an exhausting offensive ) tried to size a bridge head over the vistula but was destroyed by german marshall model counter strike . 
  on the other hand , the ussr was not particularly fond of the polish insurrection and deliberately hampered the small help from the west . 
  well if you are next to a threat you have 2 solutions : either find common allies which was impossible for the ussr or to ally yourself to this threat to make it an ally . 
  in term of pure realpolitik , the calculus and decision is totally understandable a priori . 
  yep , on top of that they already told him several time that they did n't want him ( normal he is the symbol of hollande failure ) . 
  this guy just committed a political suicide this morning . 
  not in french tough , champignon = fungus rather in french you can say `` with all this damp i have `` champignons '' on my foot '' while i believe mushroom would be incorrect here . 
  well just like u/crazycanine says , most of us , non british european have no idea of whom he is . 
  if we solely take into account this letter , he indeed looks to be a respectable politician . 
  interesting that 5 % of le pen electors decided to abstain for the 2nd turn . 
  i guess that marine le pen 's lamentable performance during the debate influenced them . 
  yeah the donald is gon na massively shitpost on r/france and call us `` cucks '', 
  the_donald , the sub where there is no french ? 
  even the people from the discord of the front national or the pro fn member of the `` 18-25 '' ( france 's biggest forum ) found that marine was lamentable during this debate : http://huffingtonpost.fr/2017/05/03/debat-macron-le-pen-sur-discord-marine-le-pen-ne-convainc-p_a_22067963/, 
  not very effective , as the doge of venice that ordered the sack of venice in 1204 was blind ( nothing to do with a byzantine punishment ), 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  the social democrats composed most of the executives/deputies from the parti socialiste and i can guarantee you that a lot of them ( if not the majority ) would much rather join macron if he win rather than the hamon/m \u00e9lenchon 's left . 
  this really show the difference between the 2 candidates . 
  le pen purely acted as a populist , stayed 20 min to take selfies , made empty promises and just left after , claiming that she represents the worker while macron is the system . 
  macron spent over one hour discussing with the syndicate to look for a viable solution for the employees . 
  and more importantly he later showed his balls today by accepting to be confronted and explaining his project to the hostiles workers for 40 min which booed him and often showed their disrespect . 
  he also refused to promise that they will be saved as it would be intellectually dishonest . 
  he is the dude who wants to make france the first galactic power by colonizing the moon or mars . 
  even if i have voted for macron i kind of understand their stance . 
  in 2002 they already had to vote for a candidate they despise to avoid le pen . 
  but nothing or so little changed during the last 15 years , it 's not a morale method to do shitty things ( especially speaking about the money embezzlement and corruption ) during your mandate and then in election times shouting `` fn/trump neo facist !! '', 
  ( whether it 's true or not ) to get the votes . 
  for france it was under val\u00e9ry giscard d'estaing before the oil crisis in 1974 . 
  our politician ( especially chirac who had 12 years of good economic conjecture ) did nothing or almost during all this time ... 
  oh gosh i thought it was `` daughter '' and was like ... 
  yes indeed but the polls actually `` corrects '' their results according to the past elections by increasing the score of le pen .
