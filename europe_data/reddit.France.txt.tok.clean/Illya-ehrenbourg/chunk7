  lithuanian people i have heard about : vytautas , mindaugas , ladislas jagellon ... and that 's all i guess x ), 
  i am sure that they are many german more famous than adolf von nassau !, 
  dunno but any people who has done post graduate studies with a bit mathematics must known about him . 
  living ones : jk rowling andy murray ewan mc gregor, 
  maybe add timochenko , mostly for her hairstyle lol . 
  for dead people , can add niels henrik abel , mostly known for the mathematics prize named after him . 
  maybe zidane , although not as known as when he was still playing, 
  what about charles v ? 
  much better than the former `` x way to divide europe '' post , 70 % of them were just lazy posts, 
  as english as chopin is french i guess :-), 
  can add zadok the priest , people may not know this peace but they surely know the football champion 's league based on handel 's work !, 
  would also add carmen of bizet if you count opera . 
  http://imgur.com/a/0xrsr russian alaska , japanese hawaii , british oregon and 13 colonies , french louisiana , spanish florida and new spain !, 
  lol i 'm already imagining the draw for the deployment region in a foreign european country . 
  `` recruit a you are to serve 6 months in ... barcelona '' ( `` yeah !, 
  great weather , playa , hot chick ! '' ), 
  `` recruit b , you will serve in ... lapland '' ( fuck it , terrible weather , polar night , and first line against russia ! ), 
  well i \u00b4 ve got family who migrated to the us so the answer is pretty obvious ... 
  til that polish men throw water and whip single women . 
  yeah i 'm asking my country 's bank to change franc to deutschmark , the exchange rate is better ... wups i forget it , we have got single currency !, 
  norway oil from the northern sea implanted in french territorial seas !, 
  on a more serious note , i would say i envy the morale integrity of the swedish politicians . 
  a minister from there had to resign after being caught having an alcohol level of 0.2 grammes per litre of blood while driving . 
  something like that would never happen in france , \u00e0 french deputy was found guilty not once , but twice driving under the influence of alcool ( the 2nd time he was over 2g/l ... and insulted police men ) but nope it 's fine to stay a representative ... 
  i find the 2nd republic purple stripe so sexy . 
  too bad you changed it : x, 
  not a royalist , and from a purely esthetic point of view , i like the french royal flag better http://lelegitimiste.hautetfort.com/media/00/01/3867231447.gif, 
  what about a 50 - 50 ? 
  rather yes , he is mostly remembered for the trial of the templar knights and taking advantage of the jews . 
   do french consider louis ix a national hero to be proud of ? 
  yes ( better known as saint louis , french people generally wo n't know which one number 9 is ) , he is considered as a very just , pious king , preoccupied by the fate of the poor . 
   is this period of history generally frowned upon or remembered in honor in your country ? 
  mixed i would say , some people denounced the violence of the crusades ( like the slaughter of jerusalem population ) , while other said it was the normal thing in this era and remind that it was defensive war to help the byzantine and protect the pilgrims . 
  the templar knights are generally considered pretty badass . 
  my high school history teacher would often remind the cultural/economic/scientific gain of the crusade to the west . 
  the albigensian crusade however is regarded pretty badly as it is an example of religious intolerance toward heretic brother of faith . 
  `` what is this what this is what that ? '', 
  accurate translation `` what is it ? '', 
  same here , only know about georg kastrioti aka skanderbeg because eu4 . 
  - austria cauz i 'm interested in history and the holy roman empire .

  - ukraine , the cradle of the russian civilization . 
  ally = / = overlord when your friend is starting to do shit , the best thing to do is to warn him . 
  wrong sub , you want to check r/the _ europe or r/le _ pen, 
  is n't it prohibited by the wto anyway to be considered as a market economy ? 
   has there been any scholarly reinvestigation/revisionism into him as a character during the german occupation of france , which paints him in a more sympathetic light ? 
  or is the post-war consensus correct in placing him as a tin-pot autocrat ? 
  immediately after the war , many people including jews viewed him not so badly , they kind of understood that he had to sacrifice the few ( the jews , mostly non french jews ) to save the many . 
  however , historians showed that he actively participated to the collaboration , going even further than the german asked , so yeah , except for a few people from the far right , he is mostly seen as a traitor . 
  not to mention his disastrous decision to make the soldier capitulate ( and thus deported to germany ) before the armistice . 
  however , people still recognize his major role during ww1 , it 's a quite common thing that people artificially distinguish `` the p\u00e9tain of verdun '' and `` the p\u00e9tain of the collaboration '' as if it was different people . 
  do n't think he was really known in france . 
  personality only heard his name mentioned before the election , it was just an american businessman that i once confused with donald tusk lol . 
  are there even people not playing eu4 on this sub ? 
  hmm gon na say sweden , i be got over 1000 hours on eu4 so for studio paradox ... 
  sure i would enjoy having a discussion with a spain low countries subject !, 
  i speak spanish to god , italian to women , french to men , and german to my horse . 
  `` the '' french will always pronounce it `` ze '' , without using the tongue + teeth accurately . 
  hmm ... hercule i guess :-) french translation of heracles, 
  on the other hand parliamentary system can lead to a very instable governments , like the french 3rd republic or the italian post ww2 republic , which government on average last less than a year ... 
  do n't know about ljubljana but definitely was disappointed but napoli . 
  i was pretty young when i went there but i clearly remember the racist/rude bus driver , a dishonest cab driver and a dirty city , 100 % would not return there . 
  genuine question about online chess : how do you the other person is not using a cheating/helping tool ?

  there was a [ project ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/strait_of_messina_bridge ) to connect italy 's mainland and sicily . 
  i guess the area is not enough economically dynamic to make such a bridge an absolute necessity ... 
  love russian music and litterature , especially dimitri shostakovich and vassily grossman, 
  [ germany ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/754/886/ea3.jpg ), 
  disappointed , expected a kangaroo :(, 
  used to be lidl but the quality significantly improved in the last 10 or 15 years now , there is ed , a sub company created by carrefour, 
  https://miniaturaspepa.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dora_schwerer-gustav_01br.jpg i raise you this !, 
  sure , if it is a defensive war . 
  however as france has no border with turkey or russia and those 2 countries has not enough projection power , there wo n't be such a scenario . 
  if however russia was to start a continental war i would also volunteer myself . 
  however , i 'm not sure i would risk my life , would russia start a limited war for a baltic country ... 
  would you like to change for bohemia or bohemia-moravia ?
