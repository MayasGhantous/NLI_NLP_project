well , that 's what we reading en france too but it does n't means they resign each time . 
  this government last as long as 6 months , that 's pretty good . 
  it may be the end of the world as we know it ... or it will have almost no consequences . 
  problem is , if you let them spread all across europe , they 'll never go back . 
  : / give up lampedusa and pantelleria , their boat wo n't go far enough to reach sicily . 
   that some bullshit . 
  well , without van den hoogenband , your team did n't look that good . 
  thank to florent manaudou who won 4 of our 5 gold medals ... 
  some years ago i did n't get how we were suddenly so good at swimming , now i do n't understand why we are suddenly so bad again : /, 
  communist . 
  14th of july is our national day , aka bastille day in english speaking country , we are never calling it like that here . 
  bastille was a prison and fortress captured by revolutionaries on 14/07/1789 , as it was a symbol of king 's opppression . 
  they thought they would find weapons there . 
  they did n't :p it 's the real start of the french revolution ( * `` is it a revolt ? '', 
  `` no sire , it is a revolution . 
  '' * ) extra fun fact : we do n't know for sure what we 're celebrating actually . 
  when they decided to make this date our national day ( in 1880 ) , they could n't decide if it was for 14/07/1789 or 14/07/17 ** 90 ** . 
  official text just said : * the republic takes july 14 as annual national holiday * without stating 1789 or 1790 . 
  14/07/1790 is the day of * f\u00eate de la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration * who was roughly a reconciliation between revolutionnaries and ( not-yet-beheaded ) louis xvi . 
  regarding celebration , well , it 's essentially a [ military ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?hl=fr&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=946&amp;q=d%c3%a9fil%c3%a9+14+juillet+2014&amp;oq=d%c3%a9fil%c3%a9+&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l10.1381.2756.0.4085.7.7.0.0.0.0.111.650.5j2.7.0....0...1ac.1.52.img..0.7.647.dklcchialgk#hl=fr&amp;q=d%c3%a9fil%c3%a9+militaire+14+juillet+2014&amp;tbm=isch ) [ parade ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=patrouille+de+france&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=rcl5u72ieplyausdgzac&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=946#q=patrouille+de+france+14+juillet&amp;revid=1466176976&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  i followed the launch [ on twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/esa ) . 
  you can see the [ liftoff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mqzupepyfm ) on youtube . 
  over 1.5 liters we fall in the `` yellow '' zone ? 
  no matter what , we will * never * drink so little , it 's not even worth trying ... 
  geopgraphical indication and intellectual property rights are huge problem here in france . 
  us seems to want to deregulate a lot of thing but rules and regulations exist for a purpose . 
  champagne 's exemple is emblematic . 
  us want anyone to have authorisation to name its product champagne and that 's a huge no-no . 
  champagne is made in champagne 's region , bordeaux ' wine near bordeaux , and so on for all our drink , cheese , etc. 
  allowing otherwise is basically as if you allowed anyone to put a star in front of their cars and calling it mercedes . 
  that 's purely and simply destroying our business ' model . 
  from the same period , [ cardinal richelieu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cardinal_richelieu ) was hated and he kept a bad reputation until today . 
  remember * the three musketeers * ? 
  he was the bad guy !, 
  now that i think about it , even taking into account that i probably forgot most of my history lessons , i do n't think we ever got a really bad king . 
  most of them were either `` warlord '' or `` depraved nobles '' but i ca n't remember any real tyrant ... maybe we should n't have beheaded them finally ... 
  born in corsica , exile in saint helena , which is in the middle of atlantic ocean , between angola and brasil , 
  i suppose the little guy is painting the whole drawing . 
  and he 's painting the white sea actually , the north sea is between uk and denmark . 
  you better keep the good work , next euro championship are in amsterdam in 2016 !, 
  best ever for french athletes also . 
  extra good news : our best before was at barcelona , 4 years ago , this means we 're really on the right track and it 's not just luck or circumstance . 
  i was also surprised by the russians and germans even if russia have still a lot of medal , just not gold ones . 
  renault is making its twingo/clio/wind in [ novo mesto ] ( http://group.renault.com/en/our-company/locations/renault-locations/novo-mesto-plant-revoz/ ) . 
  how do you export radio transmission ? 
  also , how andorra exporting flour whereas they do n't have enough room for a corn field ? 
  also , cars , cars everywhere . 
  also , yeah us for exporting spacecfraft . 
  i was wondering too . 
  why do n't they just simply say `` we 're banning ukrainian 's product because we are nearly at war with them '' ? 
  come on , you blame us for selling them warships so we sell them theme park . 
  you ca n't blame us this time eh ? 
  it 's basically the opposite !, 
  hmmm ... [ yup , he did ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bertrand_cantat ) . 
  his girlfriend actually , they were n't married . 
  his wife just commited suicide when they were in the same house but it 's probably not his fault . 
  i usually really do n't like french songs but there 's one big exception : noir d\u00e9sir . 
  [ aux sombres h\u00e9ros de l'amer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od3dsxecilg ) is probably my favourite song by them but [ l'homme press\u00e9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8z549gkkem ) , [ un jour en france ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ekmyhfk42m ) or [ tostaky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq_bxt4z57y ) are also great . 
  sad they disbanded . 
  omagad , is that an attempt at diplomacy instead of showing off ? 
  thousands of people try the mont blanc each year , most do n't succeed . 
  even if it is not as tall as some mountain in other continent , it kills a lot of people each year : [ 6 yesterday and 12 the last two weeks ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/08/13/france-bodies-of-mont-blanc-climbers-found/ ) . 
  there 's [ 11 differents mount olympus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_peaks_named_olympus ) on earth and 1 on mars . 
  nothing new here , really . 
  france 's business model is selling luxury goods and weapons . 
  do n't think it 's offensive actually . 
  i would have translated * la mort aux juifs * -  * death of the jews * and not * death to jews * . 
  this name is probably more a tribute ( as we have some * street of the executed * ) than a call to kill anyone . 
  [ we did it last year . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lemonde.fr%2fpolitique%2farticle%2f2013%2f05%2f16%2fl-assemblee-nationale-supprime-le-mot-race-de-la-legislation_3272514_823448.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) surprisingly enough , it did n't work and there 's still racist people in france . 
   but to be honest , many of your european partners have a hard time seeing why they should use their forces on helping france 's former colonies . 
  why , when there 's no problem , those countries are our former colonies and we should n't even look at them , but as soon as a problem emerge , they suddenly become our former colonies and we should solve it alone ? 
  their entry point in europe [ is not usually france ] ( http://www.debatingeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/immigration03.png ) but rather italy ( via lampedusa ) , spain ( via gibraltar ) or greece . 
  france is not a entry point so it 's not there either that they should ask or asylum . 
  even if they do , the majority of asylum applications are denied but is not followed by deportation . 
  i 'm afraid there 's no nice way to solve this ... : /, 
  yup , we can and it 's free but guided tour only . 
  depending of the period , either on saturday only or everyday except sundays . 
  you can visit the palais bourbon with [ google map ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/palais+bourbon/@48.861984,2.318659,3a,90y,192h,90t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1ssyv-ris_no3_g3zotvjdua!2e0!3e5!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e66fd46b983163:0xc842f29a31303dd8!6m1!1e1 ) , but beware if you ca n't stand gilding , [ some room ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@48.862144,2.317577,3a,75y,333.19h,84.29t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1snbhjesgmomxwpfduwx4ejg!2e0!3e5 ) have enough gold to pass our budget deficit under 3 % . 
  it 's cool but paris look like crap on this picture :p here 's [ some ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5028/5683039927_8343d314b9_z.jpg ) [ better ] ( http://martinsoler.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/la-defense-hdr-panorama-from-arc-de-triomphe-martin-soler.jpg ) [ photo ] ( http://wallpaperest.com/wallpapers/paris-la-defense-arc-de-triomphe-hdr_128973.jpg ), 
  in the previous episode ( bc ) france , then gaul , was conquered by roman empire , [ julius caesar having defeated vercingetorix the gaul hero ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg ) . 
  so , no suprise at all , during 1ad to 300ad period , gaul is entirely occupied by the romans . 
  well , not entirely ... one small village of indomitable gauls still holds out against ... wait wait wait , no . 
  gaul is entirely occupied by the romans and is part of roman empire . 
  i do n't think there 's some big historical event but there 's something really important occuring then : cultural assimilation . 
  gaulish writing and language is nearly completely lost during this period . 
  second important event : in 300ad , a germanic tribe conquered clay in what is now northern belgium . 
  they are called the franks . 
  france 's relation with belgium is eff ` ing sick if you ask me . 
  mockery , paternalism , holier-than-thou attitude , there 's no healthy friendship in this . 
  our friendship and rivalry with england is much more grow up than that , without needing a fart machine . 
  i would say that `` german-love '' in france is nose diving * fast * recently . 
  concerning england ... 
  they 're , well , english . 
  france and england rivalry is historic . 
  germany does n't even exist historically . 
  england is our best friend and best ennemy . 
  of course , they are liberals assholes and cheated to stole 2012 olympics , they ca n't do anything with food except microwaving or boiling it and they ca n't properly decapitate a crowned head but ... fr & en have spend century throwing ammo and insult at each other over the channel and all over the world . 
  we also trade culture , music , fashion , people , and boring stuff . 
  they 're our closest ally for a lot of grand project like airbus , concorde , carrier and so on .
