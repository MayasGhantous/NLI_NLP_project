  let 's all make love !, 
  hi , reading the international medias like the ultra connected neckbeard obese fuck i am i see a lot of nonsense and misunderstanding on these bans and i wanted to set a few things straight : * france did not ban burkinis , no law passed in parliament about burkinis they are therefore not banned nationwide * some mayors decided to ban them , the given rationale is for security reasons because since the attack in cannes burkinis caused troubles in some places with fights sometimes starting on some beaches between muslims and non-muslims ( sometimes started by the muslims , sometimes started by the non-muslims ) . 
  to do that the mayors used their power to issue `` arr\u00eat\u00e9s '' * `` arr\u00eat\u00e9s '' are local rules a mayor can issue that only apply within the border of his city , it can be put in place or cancelled at will . 
  it means the burkini bans can be cancelled tomorrow if the mayors in question want and reinstated the month after if he thinks it 's necessary . 
  `` arr\u00eat\u00e9s '' have great flexibility allowing a mayor to react to necessities of the moment , nothing is therefore engraved in stone . 
  these local laws of course have to respect national laws , the constitution and international treaties * the conseil d'etat ( the higher administrative court ) is currently examining whether the ban in the city of villeneuve-loubet is legal or not ( it only judges on specific cases ) . 
  if it decides that this ban are abusive it will issue an order to the mayor of villeneuve-loubet to immediatly cancel this ban ( this has to be immediate , no stalling ) . 
  if it happens the other mayors will probably cancel theirs too since they will know where the conseil d'etat stands and that any association would just have to bring the matter to conseil d'etat to cancel the ban ( the conseil d'etat acts within 48h so it would not even allow them to stall ) whether you are for or against these bans , these are indisputable facts . 
  i hope it can help foreigners seeing clearer in this matter and maybe reassure some people : no france is not becoming an oppressive dictatorship . 
  we have zone rouge in the north of france , the land is so saturated with arsenic from ww1 combat there is ban on construction and exploitation of these lands and going there is advised against because there are still are a lot of old instable unexploded ammo both conventional and chemical . 
  mayo : maille is objectively the best mass produced one that you can but at the supermarket . 
  it 's more expensive than most but totally worth it . 
  all the others are pretty much indistinguishable from each other to me . 
  mustard : i generally go with amora dijon mustard which is pretty decent , i mostly use it for vinaigrette anyway . 
  probably p\u00e9tain , the guy used to be a living legend , the last street named after him got renamed some time ago though . 
  tried my hand on a variety of calibers . 
  mostly handguns but i also shot a mp5 and a glock converted as a light carbine . 
  we have a village called `` y '' . 
  well i am 31 so i 'll just give you what i listened to growing up , most of which was pretty popular at the time : rock : [ noir d\u00e9sir - l'homme press\u00e9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by1rrp9wa_y ) [ noir d\u00e9sir - tostaky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epmqeeelqik ) [ matmatah - lamb\u00e9 an dro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkb9g3xx4lw ) [ matmatah - les moutons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruwwis9rbko ) [ matmatah - l'apologie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_p2l-4mefu ) [ b\u00e9rurier noir - porcherie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fph0gre8aqw ) [ b\u00e9rurier noir - makhnovtchina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbb7rfv0ooo ) [ b\u00e9rurier noir - petit agit\u00e9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po7rsdldhmy ) [ b\u00e9rurier noir - vive le feu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nay4csvdtu ) rap / hip-hop : [ iam - petit fr\u00e8re ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inud2d7r8bk ) [ iam - n\u00e9s sous la m\u00eame \u00e9toile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn_ujjn3yqu ) [ iam - l'empire du c\u00f4t\u00e9 obscur ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw4ptgkdc1k ) [ shurik 'n - samourai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmbtduvl6dq ) [ ntm - seint saint denis style ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn1ny-rnag8 ) [ ntm - that 's my people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfqbydr6m4 ) [ ntm - pose ton gun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7trjtujkv8 ) [ assassin - s\u00e9rieux dans nos affaires ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcixn0s3f5a ) ( interesting fact : the lead singer of this group is vincent cassel 's brother ) [ assassin - esclave 2000 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azq3wmvyhki ) [ passi - les flammes du mal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgjx4a_nfo ) [ passi - je zappe et je matte ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrlmmnzbqhe ) [ passi - le maton me guette ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7yfk-ftori ) [ neg ` marrons - le bilan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyhmeysm14k ) [ saian supa crew - raz de mar\u00e9e ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uohvtmqfxxk ) [ saian supa crew - angela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdgwkhvubka ) i could probably make a much bigger comment with shit like that but they are the first coming to my mind . 
  i like his foreign policy and i mostly hate his domestic project ( except the anti-nepotism laws ) and the general way he leads ( a part of france already nicknamed him `` jupiter '' because he is seen as leading his underlings with a iron grip ) . 
  i am torn . 
  if that 's that then the bar for what is considered anti-polish has been set incredibly low . 
  this is exactly their argument . 
  they are just that delusional . 
  not directly but if they are a threat for eastern europe they are de facto a threat for us too since we have a triple alliance ( economic , political and military ) with countries threatened by russia . 
  i support any country 's right to defend its interests . 
  brexit is uk 's own stupid decision , it should therefore mainly affect them . 
  if ireland is negatively impacted it 's their right to use their veto . 
  honestly you get used to it after a while . 
  i used to live in picardy where temperature is always very temperate thanks to the sea and now live in lyon where temperature is way higher in summer and way lower in winter and i definitly got used to it . 
  wait , did we invade you recently ? 
  that 's a urban legend . 
  depends , if do n't count parisians we probably are among the nicest . 
  haha the good old spanish obsession with napoleon . 
  it was a long time . 
   i think its clear to say americans have relized trump is not the great president he claims to be . 
  what do people outside of the us think of him ? 
  does anybody think that trump has been doing a good job ? 
  some far right nutjobs do . 
  apart from the people informing themselves solely on `` alternative '' medias , not really no . 
  most people think he is batshit insane , unstable and childish . 
   america has always said its the top superpower in the world . 
  do other counrties look up to it as the gaurdian , like our country so often seems , helping out any country in need ? 
  you do what you think will benefit you , like every other country on earth . 
  you just tend to be the only ones expecting thanks for that from other countries . 
  apart from that , i would see the us as a guardian , more like an friendly country we happen to disagree regularly with . 
   i have to ask about north korea . 
  our country keeps stating how big of a threat it is and that leader kim jong-il is a lunatic that ca n't be reasoned with . 
  i just saw one news clip of 4 women arguing to one man that theres clearly no way to negotiate with this un-nigotiable man , and the only way to solve this is more sanctions . 
  i couldnt help but think that our president himself would be just as unwilling and unable to negtiate as nk . 
  does the rest of the world realy think kim wont stop untill the states are destoryed , and theres nothing we can do to stop this crazy man , or do people more just think america is the one pushing their buttons and blowing this out of proportion ? 
  kim wants one think : stay in power . 
  nk does not give two shits about the us or anyone else . 
  they ca n't be negotiated with , if you want leverage on them negotiate with china and the situation will unlock magically in a matter of days . 
  nk has always acted this way , trump is just too `` stoopid '' or ill-advised to understand the dynamic : nk gets famine  nk starts threatening people  other countries give nk food aid  kim dynasty stays in power  nk shuts the fuck up . 
  nk is no threat to anyone . 
  kim 's only care in the world is to stay in power . 
  if he thought sucking one thousand dicks would achieve that goal he would suck one thousand dicks immediatly . 
   as marijuana starts to become legalis lzed aross our country , even though its still actually federally illegal ( a concept that i still really quite understand ) , i notice i dont know much about the drugs reputatiom in other countries , other than that amsterdam is the supposed pot capitol of the world . 
  do other coutries care about it ? 
  is it just a normal thing in other places ? 
  as well as the constant contoversy here that hemp would be better to grow than trees for basicly everything , yet we still just destroy forrests . 
  do other countries do the same and keep using wood products instead of hemp , which would be much more benificial ? 
  it 's not legal in france but a lot of people smoke it in france . 
  i would say it 's pretty normal and common here even though it 's illegal and could get you in minor troubles with the authorities . 
   what really is like the general outside veiw of the world on america in general ? 
  is it a nice place to live , do we have our shit together , and are we a country worth looking up to ? 
  a lot of things about the us just make little sense to most europeans but if that 's the way you like to do things we do n't really care as long as it does not affect us too much . 
  lack of free public healthcare is generally something we associate with third world country for example even though we know you are not a third world country it always kind of strikes as weird that such a rich country does not have what we see as a basic commodity . 
   what does the rest of the world believe about aliens and the exsistance of life other than that of earth ? 
  have they been here before ? 
  are they here now ? 
  i think its impossiboe to say that no other life exsists and i fully believe there are other things out there , and that they have been here . 
  seeing the pretty much infinite size of the universe it 's almost certain that there are other lifeforms even if just a bacteria somewhere . 
  it does not make a difference though since we most probably will never have the means to even communicate with them ( assuming they are intelligent enough to communicate ) becaus of the sheer distance separating them from us . 
  i do n't think that 's why they would have an inferiority complex if they have one . 
  the communism era and the gap in developement that resulted would be more likely in my opinion . 
  polish ca n't really be blamed for losing in ww2 when the western governments were debating for months whether they should invade germany or not while they were getting steamrolled . 
  as churchill said after the munich agreement : `` you had the choice between dishonor and war . 
  you picked dishonor and you will get war . '', 
  great actor but he is batshit insane and guzzles wine like it 's water . 
  i think it kind of goes without saying that we are talking conventional warfare . 
  we all know what would happen in the case of a nuclear war . 
  yeah . 
  the us would probably win at first albeit with losses and then the occupation would be nightmare so in the end the public would turn against the war and the us would have to withdraw . 
  yeah i second lyon , have been living there for three years and i love it . 
  i only got [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v5cq1ny.jpg ) , he is my mother 's dog and i do n't really live near her . 
  i think it is the pic / u/mcaustic is referring to . 
  haha cookie is officially internet famous . 
  depends on you . 
  we already have a mena population , some do well , some do n't . 
  if your reason for coming here is `` secular countries that value human rights and personal freedoms ( a concept that was slightly foreign to me ) . '', 
  you will probably be among those who do well . 
  those who do n't do well tend to be the ones who keep putting their religion in people 's face and think bringing the worst aspects of their country of origin to europe is what we call `` integration '' . 
  the main reason being that you are far from middle east while we are right next to them . 
  pretty much everything i do , i really dislike owning things so i never buy things unless i absolutly need them . 
  my main source of non necessary spending are generally things that include hanging out with friends . 
  my ideal appartement would be half empty if i had no gf to clutter it with an endless supply of shoes and `` innovative '' kitchen wares . 
  yeah napoleon is tricky to judge as a whole because he napoleonic wars started as defensive wars against the beleaguered monarchies and he also brought so many administrative and judicial innovations so you can very well hate him as a military man but acknowledge his civilian work . 
  ouch , yeah i can imagine .
