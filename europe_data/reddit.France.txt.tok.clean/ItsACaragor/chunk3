  it wo n't happen now . 
  and sarkozy is not presidential candidate , he is a contender but he is far from sure to be the candidate of his party since he is super impopular . 
  they suffered a lot because of collaborators . 
  most germans were just doing what they were told and had not much of a choice , collaborators were traitors who sold off their neighbors for a few advantages , a petty neighbor dispute or because they strongly believed in nazi ideals . 
  most of the resistants at the end of the war had personnally lost a friend or family because a collaborator sold them to the germans . 
  it sucks for the people who were persecuted and for the women who got shaven just for having an adventure with a german soldier but the actual collaborators were scum of the earth and a bullet in the head was way too sweet for them . 
  is is a joke ? 
  i do n't know one french person living at the time who was not happy about liberation . 
  sure there were rapes and the occasional looting but all in all i highly doubt you will find a majority of people thinking liberation was bad . 
  yep , i downvoted this post for misleading title . 
  this is a huge difference . 
  valls actually said that he understood the mayors who banned burkini which is pretty much the opposite . 
  that 's seriously fucked up . 
  i am basically on the same position as you , burkinis are stupid and i do n't want to see them . 
  i am still not in favor of banning it as i think people should have the right to live in a way i think is stupid . 
  you are aware that sarkozy has absolutly no power or relevance today in france ? 
  he is not even sure to be the candidate of his party at the elections . 
  he makes a lot of noise and tries to take very conservative stances to try and woo fn electorate and stay into relevance but he is nothing . 
  it could end up being a definitive ban i do n't know but whether or not it will be is absolutly not up to sarkozy . 
  melenchon is in favor of stopping to talk about burkinis and talk about real matters . 
  he said burkini was a provocation but also criticized valls for running straight into the trap so i do n't think he is in favor of bans . 
  sarkozy and le pen are just being sarkozy and le pen , nothing new under the sun . 
  valls loves anything restricting civil liberties with a passion . 
  at the moment sarkozy is not even guaranteed to be the candidate of the right . 
  he has some serious adversaries for this and the fact that 79 % of french people do n't want him back certainly do n't help his case either . 
  he is trying to make noise . 
  anything he says should pretty much disregarded at the moment . 
  provided sarko is the candidate of the right , yes . 
  fortunately there are people who want the same thing and sarko is not necessarily the best place for that . 
  in a recent poll 79 % of french people declared that they did not want sarko back . 
  it would be pretty stupid from the right to choose a candidate hated by 80 % of the people before the campaign even starts . 
  sarko as a candidate would be pretty much the only scenario where hollande stands a slight chance of being reelected , anyone but sarkozy and hollande loses 100 % of the time . 
  if the right makes hollande this gift we officially have the dumbest right in the world . 
  he has always been a big mouth wooing fn electorate . 
  it generally stops at words though . 
  he said he would `` clean up '' the shitty criminal ridden neighborhoods `` with a karcher '' in june 2005 ( he was the ministry of interior at the time ) and we are still waiting for one single measure going this way . 
  he even reduced the number of cops while he was president which is weird to say the least when you campaign on security . 
  sarkozy is a big joke . 
  good old paul bismuth, 
  it 's just sarkozy wooing the fn electorate . 
  do n't see too much into it . 
  the reason why they were our first pets is that we shared a common usage of persistence hunting and we both discovered that cooperation would be more beneficial than competition : the humans benefitted from wolves speed and tracking skills and the wolves did not have to get close and personal with their quarry because the humans could kill them from afar . 
  ukraine is neither eu nor nato , hence it was not defended by eu and nato . 
  [ there you go !, 
  ] ( http://www.megafete.be/boutique/12453-thickbox/moustache-frenchman.jpg ), 
  grossly inflated too . 
  you can still wear burkinis in 99 % of french beaches . 
  they are local bans issued by a grand total of thirty cities . 
  it 's arabic and they have a different alphabet so both are phonetic anyway . 
  you are being a tad dramatic . 
  not to most muslims . 
  damn , now i want to try it just out of curiosity but i only have baguette . 
  i guess i 'll add toasts on my shopping list . 
  the `` more seriously '' at the beginning of the next sentence means that the previous sentence was intended as a joke , there is absolutly no ambiguity in my comment about that . 
  of course not . 
  are you really that thick ? 
   ** more seriously ** -  ** more seriously ** -  ** more seriously **, 
   on one hand i really like when muslims are persecuted but on the other hand if that oppresses women even a little bit it ca n't really be a bad thing . 
  -  more seriously, 
  ** my meatballs ** you need : * meatballs : * half grounded veal , half grounded beef savory crackers , whatever you got is probably fine onions eggs * sauce : * coffee onions garlic peeled tomatoes tomato sauce worcestershire sauce mustard brown sugar tabasco ( if you like it spicy ) grind your crackers to dust and finely chop the onions . 
  put your meat in a big salad bowl . 
  add an egg , the crackers , some mustard and the onions on top of it then mix all that by kneading it all for as long as necessary . 
  adding a bit of sprinkling water to the preparation helps have tender meatballs but do n't add too much . 
  when it 's well mixed up , put some cooking paper on a table and put your big ball of meat on it then divide it in as many meatballs as you like . 
  when it 's done put them in a frying pan with a generous quantity of oil and cook your meatballs ( your fire should be hot enough to cook them at heart but not too hot to prevent them from sticking too much . 
  at the same time brew some coffee . 
  when your meatballs seem cooked enough put your peeled tomatoes and tomato sauce with them , then add a dash of worcesrsdqrrshire sauce , a good spoon of mustard , the chopped up onions , the garlic and brown sugar . 
  then add your coffee while tasting as you add it . 
  it has to give your sauce a nice taste but do n't turn it into a coffee sauce . 
  at this point put your fire on low and let it cook for a little while and do n't forget to stir from time to time . 
  add tabasco if you like spicy . 
  add salt and pepper . 
  serve with rice or whatever you like with it . 
  beans should be cool too . 
  what i do generally is i do industrial quantities of them and then i congeal the most part of them ( make sure to divide them into little ziplock bags , if you put everything in the same bag you will hate yourself the day you will unfreeze them ) this way the day i do n't know what to do or do n't feel like cooking i have delicious meatballs ready to be used and abused like the little whores they are . 
  feel free to share your favorite mint flavored jelly or whatever you guys eat . 
  ** crudaiola ** need pasta , mozza di bufala , olive oil , basil and cherry tomatoes . 
  cook some short pasta ( i like fusili personally but do what you want ) . 
  while your pasta is cooking , take a bit salad bowl , tear appart your mozza in it , then cut your cherry tomatoes cut in half in it and put some olive oil and basil in it . 
  do n't add anything else , it 's enough . 
  when the pasta is cooked just pour the hot pasta in the salad bowl with the rest and mix well . 
  serve , eat and die because it is so good it will make you die . 
  it 's vegetarian friendly but who the fuck wants to eat a meal with vegetarians . 
   so who is better , the taliban or french politicians ? 
  people are free to answer this question but i assume those who think the taliban are better will do the logical thing and start packing their stuff . 
  the hadiths, 
  i am very on the fence on burkinis . 
  on one hand i really like when muslims are persecuted but on the other hand if that oppresses women even a little bit it ca n't really be a bad thing . 
  more seriously i really have a hard time forming a balanced opinion on the topic . 
  i feel like it is accomodation which is probably a good thing but at the same time i ca n't help but feel like it is somehow less accomodating than previous accomodations if that makes sense . 
   the relevant thing to do would have been to show a statistic of scientist religious beliefs compared to non-scientists , then you will spot patterns . 
  you miss burukainu 's point though . 
  no idea . 
  one thing about the burkini i have been wondering , maybe someone knowledgeable with muslim faith can answer . 
  the way i see things if you are really someone who want to follow the quran rules about men and women you ca n't go to a mixed beach , with or without veil or burkini . 
  so whether they wear a veil or not they are already violating islamic rules . 
  then why wear a veil at all ? 
  i do n't mean to troll i am genuinely trying to understand the logic of religious people . 
  if you follow their idea , the shooter would be neutralized quickly by pretty much anyone around him should he choose to act anyway . 
  the nra logic about this is that if there are decent people with guns everywhere bad guys with guns will hesitate to act out of fear of being gunned down by the store clerk or by the girl waiting for the bus that they did not see .
