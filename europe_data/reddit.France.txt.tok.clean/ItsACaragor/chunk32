  yeah of course , some variations are to be expected among the population but we differ from a a lot of countries where people can basically just live like they did in their country of origin . 
  that 's a big no-no here . 
   do n't mean to start something but we often hear after a terrorist attack that muslims in europe are arrested more than others and when the burka ban was taught here the news media said it was very far right discrimination thing but maybe our media is wrong and it not as bad . 
  us medias like to make people in the us feel good about themselves and medias in the eu like to make eu people feel good about themselves . 
  that 's just a fact of life that papers and news channel have to sell to survive and what sells is news that makes you feel like you are lucky to live where you live because elsewhere is obviously worse . 
  muslims have no special rights or obligations and are not singled by any law because that would be completly unconstitutional . 
  they are completly equal in the law and the government is not even allowed to record their religion , meaning the police has no way to know what their religion is . 
  when there is a ban on religious symbols it concerns all religious symbols or none but singling out one would be unconstitutional and the law would be struck down before even coming into effect . 
  now whether they are happy i do n't know since i am not muslim . 
  is a french person ever happy though ? 
  there is not particular ban singling out burkas . 
  covering your face in public is what is banned , whether it 's religious garb or not is not specified . 
  things like motorcycle helmets are allowed but should be taken off when you get off your motorcycle . 
  it 's not how it works here . 
  there is only one culture in france and it 's the french one . 
  immigrants are expected to do the necessary work to adapt to it . 
  covering your face in public is banned whatever the reason . 
  the ban does not specify anything about religious garbs . 
  as long as your face is visible you are free to wear whatever you like . 
  every religious symbol is banned in public schools though , whatever the religion . 
  no debate , a year back a few mayors banned burkinis from the beaches of their cities . 
  some organizations asked our conseil d'etat whether banning this was constitutional or not and the conseil d'etat ruled that it was n't . 
  all the mayors cancelled the ban immediatly after that . 
  there was never a country wide ban , just a few mayors who took this initiative and it lasted maybe two weeks . 
  reading the title i thought this would be an absolut popcorn post and i must say i am not disappointed . 
  everyday . 
  i live in a big city . 
  how comes no one thought of doing it before ? 
  that 's genius !, 
  just a little remark , difficulty of the local language varies a lot depending on your mother language and exeperience with language learning . 
  i love austria . 
  you do n't bring money with you to the next world ( if there is one ) so why bother ? 
  you just need enough to cover your needs and entertainment . 
  jean vincent plac\u00e9 ( political buffoon , born in south korea ), 
  true enough . 
  every modern country does that . 
  does not mean you can not catch diseases afterwards ... 
  there are many cases where you may not know you got something , like for example if you so cheats on you and never discovers it . 
  they may not know though . 
  yeah , why not . 
  i know i would never say no personally . 
  it would not be very useful in my case though as i am a regular blood donor and they always take a sample for testing and contact you the second they find anything odd . 
  yeah we have a lot . 
  spahis regiments ( spahis used to be mounted soldiers from morocco ) still wear the [ `` burnous '' ] ( http://www.defense.gouv.fr/var/dicod/storage/images/base-de-medias/images/terre/terre-images/maj-regiments-et-unites/1er-regiment-de-spahis/1643349-1-fre-fr/1er-regiment-de-spahis.jpg ) , a traditional north african cloak used by berbers to protect themselves against cold . 
  it comes from the fact that these regiments used to be made up of moroccan colonial troops and they retained some of their traditions as a tribute to them . 
  1er r\u00e9giment de tirailleur have their motto `` first , always first '' written in arabic [ on their unit symbol as well as the islamic crescent ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/insigne_r%c3%a9gimentaire_du_1er_r%c3%a9giment_de_tirailleurs.jpg ) . 
  the uniform of their music corps [ is also distinctly oriental looking ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/la_nouba_du_1er_r%c3%a9giment_de_tirailleurs_d%27%c3%89pinal_en_tenue_de_tradition_01.jpg?uselang=fr ) . 
  all these are obvious tributes to the bravery of the colonial soldiers who used to fight in these regiments . 
  l\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re is known for keeping a lot of very old traditions , among others they are one of the very rare regiments in france to use the turkish crescent in their music corps that they adorn with horse tails . 
  it comes from an ottoman tradition where soldiers kept the tail of horses who died under their cavalryman as it was a symbol of courage . 
  engineer corps of the l\u00e9gion also keep bushy beards , leather apron and axe as part of their formal uniforms . 
  [ all l\u00e9gion units also march at a slow , deliberate pace during parades . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kod7nbokpi ) those are just a few examples . 
  they are muslims are n't they ? 
  there are a lot of things wrong with arab armies and their main problem is that they are more for politicking than warring . 
  as a result officers mistrust each other , do n't share information with anyone because they consider that information is power , do n't give a fuck about the people under them , punish any initiative even good ones because they see it as undermining their power and are more interested in covering their asses than in taking risks . 
  crazy thing is that this system is actually encouraged by those in power because for them an efficient and well run military is just the fastest way to a military coup . 
  that 's why most arabic armies have been shit for a good while and will continue to be shit for the foreseeable future . 
  it actually has very little to do with cowardice and a lot to do with the fact that they are purposefully organized in a shitty way to not threaten the ones in power . 
  you forget the part were those secular forces were homocidal maniacs who kept power through terror and brutality . 
  i am sure it does . 
  i should have specified that i was talking about we . 
  far left is not necessary communist . 
  i would even say that the huge majority of modern far left parties do not advocate at all for bringing communism back . 
  if i take m\u00e9lenchon in france for example he is definitly far left but he is okey with market economy . 
  he just wants some protection for workers so they do n't have to juggle with three jobs to make ends meet and some accountability for ceos . 
  edit : your downvotes without comments do n't prove me wrong , they just show your unwillingness to admit you are wrong and change your views . 
  no one cares about blacks , it 's not like in the us . 
  in europe most fascists do n't really care about race but about religion and culture . 
  i know quite a bunch of these ( do n't ask ) and i would say maybe one on ten actually cares about black or yellow people . 
  islam is what gets them going . 
  additionally you say you are spanish but if you actually knew the first thing about spain you would know that far right hardly exists there since they had a far right regime that only ended decades ago and those tend to vaccinate a country for a while against far right . 
  completly untrue . 
  not tipping at all is absolutly the norm . 
  good call !, 
  apart from the vignette i hope you can drive sticks 90 % of cars are sticks in europe and if you did n't specifically asked for an automatic your car will probably be stick . 
  i may start using island monkeys, 
  we do n't really have many koreans , our main asian community are vietnamese . 
  i know many of them ( a cousin of my mother married a vietnamese man ) and i could not tell you what their religion is or even whether they have one to save my life . 
  being religious is not really the problem as much as how much noise you make about it . 
  some people say `` ar\u00e9oport '' instead of ar\u00e9oport . 
  one word : religion . 
  pretty much every asian i ever met in europe were not really religious people and if they are they generally keep it to themselves . 
  in france ( and i know it 's the case in other euro countries ) we kind of put religion behind us and we like it when it is a strictly private matter . 
  some muslim immigrants seem to have trouble with that and get a bad reputation for this reason . 
  black people do n't generally have much trouble here . 
  it sucks but we are still pretty far from uk as far as i know . 
  taxes are not inherently good or bad . 
  what can be bad is what you do or do n't do with them . 
  we do n't really have `` taxation is theft '' , right wingers generally say that they are too high and we should streamline and left wingers generally say that the state should have the means to conduct an efficient action . 
  i do n't think anyone is against taxes as a matter of principles . 
  hank huley in french . 
  sounds exactly like `` encul\u00e9 '' which means `` someone who takes it up the ass '' . 
  sweet food would be waffles and cr\u00eapes . 
  savory things would be galette saucisse , kebab , am\u00e9ricain ( baguette sandwich with some meat and fries in it ) , fries and mussles . 
  a lot of tourists seem to think paris is just another name for france . 
  ca n't really blame them though , french medias and politicians make this mistake all the time too . 
  they are the same person !, 
  that 's incredible !, 
  `` l'\u00e9cole du micro d'argent '' by iam and `` supr\u00eame ntm '' by ntm are generally recognized as two very good examples of `` classic '' french hip hop albums .
