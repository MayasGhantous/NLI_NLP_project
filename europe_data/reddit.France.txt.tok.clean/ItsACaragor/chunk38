  they do n't `` fail to pass a budget '' they `` block a budget because they do n't think it is a good budget '' . 
  i am 31 and it must have happened maybe 4 times in my life and everytime we were warned a few days before that they had to intervene on the line and had to cut power for a few minutes and they apologized for it . 
  it happening in an accidental way i ca n't really remember, 
  white supremacism is not extremely common . 
  most far right groups specifically target islam and to a much lesser extent the jews and gays . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloc_identitaire even the most well know skinhead leader in paris is half christian libanese and therefore half arabic [ you can see him here in business suit with his book discussion club ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rffrizj.jpg ), 
  i think it became kind of a meme . 
  nouvelle observateur even made a full investigation to try to understand why this flag was found pretty much everywhere in completly unrelated events . 
  depends where you are from . 
  french people are not very used to a/c , not that it is unheard of or a luxury but we are just not fans ( pun intended ) . 
  if you are from the us and used to everything having a/c it may be slightly uncomfortable , if not you should be okey really . 
  just shut every window and shutter during the day to keep the hot air out and open everything at night to let the cool air in . 
  in france , touching healthcare system = political suicide . 
  it would be as if a us politician called for turning the us into a centralized country with an unarmed police . 
  the simple rumour that fillon wanted to alter it in some ways lost him several points in the polls and we still do n't know whether he actually intended to or not or even if he actually said anything concrete about that . 
  like being a political opposant for example ? 
  you are n't . 
  you are like an old woman who keeps repeating to his husband any mistake he did in the past again and again to make him feel bad instead of trying to build the future with him . 
  stay in the past then . 
  we warred with england for centuries and ended up allies in two major conflicts . 
  we warred three times in a row against germany to the point where every single frenchman has a relative who killed germans or got killed by germans and they are now probably one of our closest partners . 
  honestly what 's with eastern europe and grudges . 
  i know soviet union was terrible but you are no longer in it now and dwelling on the past slights just holds you back . 
  every single country in europe got shafted hard by another at some point in history , you are not special or unique . 
  the mere concept of eu is to try and put that shit behind us and build something good so those things happen again . 
  no one is paying anything to nato ... 
  not happy , no . 
  i see that as the silver lining of a very shitty situation . 
  yeah . 
  i used to have free 's 0 $ plan too but i upgraded when i switched to a smartphone . 
  / r/polandball, 
   you might ** very well ** think that but i could not possibly comment . 
  it 's common to emigrate for economic reasons but in some cases it 's different . 
  a lot of spanish republicans moved to france fleeing persecutions from franquist regime . 
  some guy i used to know on facebook made a status about it saying he supported this decision wholeheartedly and that we should do the same . 
  problem is knowing him it is always hard to tell whether he is trolling or not . 
  or maybe i am in denial . 
  italy . 
  as the saying goes : `` an italian is a french person in a good mood '', 
  i pay 20 $ for a plan that fits my needs and i never have to talk to them . 
  that 's all ask of them . 
  he met her twice already iirc and they seemed to click well . 
  the reports of these meetings seemed encouraging with germany seeming kind of more open and reasonable than what i expected . 
  obviously we need to wait for anything concrete to actually forge an opinion but the first signs seem encouraging is what i mean . 
  macron and merkel are also natural allies ideologically in my opinion even if they obviously have disagreement they probably have many more things they agree on . 
  i think they probably feared that we would put le pen in power which probably works in favour of macron too . 
  i do n't think they are many filipinos in france so there is probably no real image for filipinos in france . 
  we do have a sizable vietnamese minority ( since vietnam used to be a french colony ) and they are mostly well integrated and hard working people . 
  they seem to enjoy not making waves most of the times so there is no strong feelings about them generally in france and probably little in the way of discrimination . 
  my brain keeps erasing the memory for some reason . 
  i 'll only do decent sized countries as i probably do n't know enough about very small ones to judge them fairly . 
  ** admire : ** * germany : * they do n't beat around the bush , if you are being an asshole they will just tell you `` you are being an asshole '' , if they think you are cool they will just tell you `` you are cool '' and they expect the same sincerity in return . 
  that 's something i respect a lot . 
  i hate people who will take one million detour to say one simple thing . 
  i just think doing that is just treating you like an adult , if you ca n't take it then you probably are not an adult . 
  * uk : * i like the endurance they showed while fighting at our side during both world war . 
  they took many casualties alongside us and they never gave up despite the odds . 
  [ this cartoon kind of explains my feelings about them ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/609/815/941.png ) . 
  they make awesome comedy series often with very little means . 
  * italy : * i already did them in another comment . 
  * switzerland : * i do n't really hate or love anything about switzerland . 
  i know they are supposed to be very serious and very rich but i do n't feel like i know enough to have a strong opinion . 
  * belgium : * awesome beer ( best in the world for me ) , awesome sense of humor . 
  i dig their mayo on fries game too . 
  * spain : * all the spanish people i met were very good company and they were very fun to party with so i guess that 's what i like in them . 
  ** dislike ( hate is such a strong word ) : ** * germany : * up until recently i was very wary that they seemed to be kind of greedy with eu , making profits everywhere in the eu and not investing anything in return and i thought it would be terribly damaging to eu in the medium / long term . 
  i am not a macron man at all but i have to admit that i like the fact that he seems to work well with merkel and hopefully we will see better cooperation in the future . 
  * uk : * the attitude they pretty much always had with eu . 
  their way to be here and not be here at the same time and block any attempt at progress . 
  in a way i am sad to see them go but in another way i feel like they never really believed in eu as a political project and access to the market was all they always wanted . 
  * italy : * i already did them in another comment . 
  * switzerland : * i do n't really hate or love anything about switzerland . 
  i know they are supposed to be very serious and very rich but i do n't feel like i know enough to have a strong opinion . 
  your . 
  roads . 
  * spain : * do you guys have to speak at max volume all the time ? 
  i mean seriously !, 
  i 'll do it properly without trolling : * love : that they are so close to us culturally , they love the same things we love and do great food and wine * hate : the fake football rivalry they seem very keen on keeping alive . 
   and frankly i 'll be hostile to whoever the fuck i want yet when people are hostile to you you label them as racist ? 
  double standard much ? 
  there is a common saying that i found applies very often : `` if you go somewhere and everyone is an asshole to you , maybe you are the asshole '' . 
  i am not saying definitly that you are an asshole but did you at least consider the hypothesis that you maybe have acted in a way that rubbed people the wrong way due to not being aware of cultural differences ? 
  because there are a lot of those between europe and north american . 
  hell , there are a lot of them among europe too but they are even bigger between you and us . 
  as everyone says here europe is not heaven on earth but i spent a few months in the us and i do believe that europe does manage racial differences much much better than the us ( ca n't tell for canada though , never went there ) . 
  i do n't mind you as a country ( except when you make some discutable choices of leadership ) but it would probably be a terrible idea . 
  we are extremely different in our preoccupations , our priorities and in the way we think about things . 
  you guys would not like it and we would not like it either . 
  i prefer you as a privileged partner / friend ( as far as countries can be friends ) . 
  there are already a lot of differences among us that we try and work with , i ca n't imagine how that could work with you . 
  so basically none of us would be satisfied . 
  sure that 's why they wo n't go near the front or rear of your car and will ask you to stop your engine . 
  weird , in france they generally ask you to remain at the wheel too and keep your safety belt . 
  it 's so it is very hard for people to attack cops . 
  i do n't like it because it stinks when you pee on concrete and it dries there . 
  find some bushes where the earth is going to absorb it all at least ( providing you are drunk and it ca n't wait ) . 
  i do n't know . 
  i enjoyed uk and i enjoy us too . 
  i do n't know why people think having enjoyed one means you have to shit on the other one . 
  both are great and kevin spacey is a terrific actor .
