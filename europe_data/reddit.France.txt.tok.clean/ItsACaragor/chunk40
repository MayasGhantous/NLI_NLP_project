  i do n't really agree but i do n't really mind . 
  fries mainly . 
  finnish cuisine too . 
  you are not a good person . 
  tuscany has always been a great place to escape the worries of life for me . 
  the whole region is great . 
  you can do some wine tasting and florence and sienna are great places to visit . 
  seeing how touristy florence is i doubt it feels empty at any time during the summer . 
  there will probably be less locals than you would get in june or september , sure , but it will be full of people nevertheless , do n't worry . 
  i would be happy to give you some recommandations of things to see / places to eat if you need . 
  yeah the use is pretty limited for most people as of today . 
  it 's still an interesting idea that could be ( and probably will be ) expanded to other countries and more services . 
  and the first to experiment a form of e-citizenship, 
  you do n't know estonia , the non eastern-european nordic country ? 
  anything you want . 
  most popular choices are mayo and ketchup . 
  in the north of france some people like vinegar . 
  there must be a synagogue or something not too far from where i live because i regularly see men with the black hats , curls and / or kippas . 
  that 's the ones i can identify for sure of course , i am sure i meet jewish people much more often than that but i have no way to know for sure . 
  census based on religion are forbidden by law in france since ww2 though so no real way to know how many there are . 
  absolutly , i follow the teachings of st plagueis the wise who defeated death itself . 
  [ turkey : shake it up \u015eekerim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m801xa1gpeg ) is pretty catchy [ ukraine : dancing lasha tumbai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone ) vierka is love , vierka is life [ france : l'amour \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjo3piabpvq ) is really hilarious with their fake frenglish and their way to put all the possible cheesy clich\u00e9s in one song [ israel : push the button ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5khpztlqbje ) very catchy too and pretty funny too [ finland : hard rock hallelujah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjwq_uqijtq ), 
  you might have some sort of mental illness . 
  i suggest you consult your physician as soon as possible . 
   bienvenue chez les ch ` tis -  la haine i really like [ `` l'ennemi intime '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3fznaszlae ) which is a great french war flick about the algerian war . 
  [ `` contre-enqu\u00eate '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3fznaszlae ) , a cop 's daughter is murdered , the cop is not convinced that the one who got sentenced is the real culprit and sets on making his own investigation to find the real murderer . 
  [ `` dobermann '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qa0cbjlz0 ) is a completly over the top movie about heisters and the corrupt cops who try to catch them . 
  lots of violence , explosions and unplausible fight scenes . 
  it 's great entertainment . 
  vladimir vladimirovitch 's favourite mount . 
  to my knowledge both these terms are synonymous . 
  my family is corsican and speaks both french and corsican if that may clarify things a bit . 
  i do n't think corsican is lesser than french , it 's just a separate dialect that 's all . 
  i just do n't understand what the downvote fest is abotu but you need to realize that downvoting me for that is just stupid . 
  because they are close as fuck and a good way to enter schengen area . 
  are you going to pretend like you do n't understand what i said for much longer ? 
  i mean my formulation may be slightly off or maybe i did not use exactly the right word , i do n't know , but you are just playing dumb right now and you know it . 
  i do n't see what you are trying to achieve exactly . 
  no they are distinct languages . 
  they have completly different origin . 
  breton is a celtic language , corsican is closer to italian both in grammar and vocabulary and basque we do n't really know but it 's totally different . 
  none of them come from french , hence `` distinct '' . 
  not exactly unknown but parma is pretty cool . 
  the city itself is not extremely big but it 's nice and the food there is just crazy and i have visited a lot of countries in italy . 
  parma just takes it to a whole other level . 
  i have heard verona is very beautiful . 
  fn fal was a pretty big export success iirc so that could be a lot of countries actually . 
  the scar could have been a giveaway it 's true since it 's mostly used by elite forces outside of belgium . 
  what 's your country ? 
  love the fn fal . 
  would love to shoot the famas , it looks really fun to shoot . 
  i am aware of this fact , yes . 
  i am french . 
  val d'aoste has road signs in french and italian for sure . 
  depends what you mean by ethnically . 
  it if means where there are a lot of immigrants , then no . 
  that would never fly in france . 
  we are very much in favour of assimiliation . 
  if you mean by that places where the historical regional culture has a dialect distinct from standard french then yeah . 
  i know of three regions which do that : brittany , corsica and basque country . 
  you can drink a beer on the balcony after sundown . 
  i actually find it very enjoyable to do so . 
  i did not say fat . 
  chubby is not exactly the same as fat . 
  it 's just over `` curvy '' but not obese either . 
  if you are into chubby girls i guess she could be pretty attractive . 
  whenever a topic of this kind is posted , this guy never fails to pop up . 
  is he some kind of irish meme ? 
  [ prognathism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prognathism ) , a condition that is often linked to heavy inbreeding . 
  why is she in a marsh ? 
  he really looked like [ mac from always sunny in philadelphia ] ( http://filmgarb.com/wp-content/uploads/tv-its_always_sunny_in_philadelphia-2005_-mac-rob_mcelhenney-tshirts-s03e14-what_are_you_looking_at_dicknose_shirt.jpg ), 
  [ middle age chirac was pretty damn hot too ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4kduppy.gif ), 
  well chr\u00e9tien de troyes being french i would say the french arthur is arthur himself, 
  suppressing dialects and minority languages in france has openly been an objective of france for centuries . 
  no wonder we never signed it . 
  our state is so pro-centralization , that 's sometimes crazy . 
  still used quite often but no longer on an official level . 
  fear is not the proper word . 
  i just think their current leader is an unstable person who would just take back all the ex-ussr countries by force if he thought he could get away with it . 
  it is also clear that one of his aims is to divide the west including european countries so it is not wonder the west distrusts him in return . 
  are you sure you are not european ? 
  there absolutly is !, 
  some slightly toasted banana bread that i made . 
  it was fucking delicious . 
  yeah from my young days when i fought against other fan groups over football games ( hey , i was young ) , still know people from that time and some are definitly far right to very far right , some being openly racist . 
  i consider myself left to far left though . 
  as a lot of people you have a skewed view of patriotism as a blind love that ignores any flaw . 
  does not work like that . 
  if loving your country is not patriotism then i do n't know what is . 
  i do n't have a problem with that . 
  thing is they better come her and experience the country a bit before they do anything definitive . 
  sometimes things are very different from what people expect , not necessarily bad but different from the idea people may have . 
  we also have a lot of cultural differences with americans and it is definitly important to keep them in mind . 
  language may be an issue too , the official language of france is french and it is the only official language so , while mostly helpful , administration wo n't go out of their way to speak english . 
  but as far as fitting in or being welcome i honestly do n't mind . 
  yeah just vinegar . 
  tastes great really, 
  i generally drink the strongest , least diluted thing i can put my hand on to act as a defibrillator on the morning . 
  :p i do like a nice cuppa though . 
  my girlfriend got a few nice teas i like to drink on occasion .
