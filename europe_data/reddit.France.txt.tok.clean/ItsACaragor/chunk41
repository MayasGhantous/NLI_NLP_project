  sriracha is not too hot and very good too , much better than most hot sauces . 
  it 's so diluted and sweet i honestly ca n't stand most of their drinks . 
  some people like it though . 
  sad !, 
  sure , i could get off my ass and order one in the macdonald 's of my neighborhood right now if i felt like it ( i do n't though , had potato gratin with mountain sausages tonight so i do n't feel like eating more fat for today ) . 
  https://www.mcdonalds.fr/produits/burgers/royal-cheese as said in the movie we do n't use the same measurement so quarter pounder would make no sense at all to a french person . 
  does not prevent starbucks from selling us `` venti '' ounces cups of shit coffee despite no french person having the slightest idea what an ounce represents but that 's another story . 
  i am from north of france and we do that a lot too . 
  ketchup is far from unheard of too though . 
  growing up fries were either eaten with mayonnaise , ketchup , a mix of both or just vinegar . 
  must be pretty good . 
  patriotism to me is thinking that you are lucky to be born where you are , embracing it wholly and wanting to make it even better than it is . 
  if someone chooses to be an asshole or a bigot about it then it 's as stupid as anything else , sure . 
  you work on the hypothesis that any patriotic emotion is necessarily blind . 
  this is just not true . 
  i like being french , love the country , love living here and i definitly consider myself patriotic , it does not prevent me from seeing flaws and wanting to fix them . 
  not necessarily , it 's just that as in a lot of things we just tend to be much much less demonstrative . 
  we are not big on flag waving or stuff like that but that 's not a taboo thing either . 
  as a people we also tend to have a pessimistic outlook on life ( this is one of our flaw ) giving the impression that we hate it here or that we think the country is going to hell but deep in our heart we really like our country , we just are never satisfied and always think it should / could be better than it is . 
  welcome to france though . 
  hope you 'll like it here . 
  sure , i consider myself a patriot and i am not a neo-nazi or even far-right ( i consider myself a leftist both socially and economically ) . 
  i just really like my country for with all its flaws and qualities . 
  yeah under the consulate he definitly was a dictator complete with the pretence of democracy . 
  i do n't really have an opinion on them to be fair , it was a very long time ago . 
  these people are just american people like the others . 
  not a lot then . 
  i mainly buy milk to cook . 
  i do n't dislike it though . 
  raw milk only or do you count transformed milk ( yogurts , cheese etc. . . ), 
  napoleon even though he probably falls into the `` monarch '' category . 
  what i know of ataturk sounds great too but that may be my inner french secularist talking . 
  have you read [ the forgotten soldier / le soldat oubli\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_forgotten_soldier ) ? 
  it 's an actual war journal written by an alsatian who got drafted in german army . 
  it 's a great read and very informative too . 
  weird , we just tape a bunch of coins together !, 
  nope , why would they ? 
  that 's a weird question . 
  yeah basically . 
  the mere idea of revenge is ridiculously immature and uncalled for but eu has to learn from past mistakes so it would be no half measures or special snowflake statuses , they either are all in or not in . 
  are you from normandy ? 
  and you did not taste it on brioche or cr\u00eapes yet . 
  travelling people and arabs fighting it out for drug trade . 
  can you be more specific ? 
  [ i do n't see what you mean ] ( https://imgur.com/g0hd3ap ), 
  i 'll give you a fun fact to explain what he means . 
  italian has been the official language of italy since pretty much its creation , yet until the public radio got widespread people still mainly talked their local dialect and few people actually talked common italian despite it being `` officially '' the language everyone had to learn and speak . 
  a few acres of land will do !, 
  you are velcome tovarisch . 
  among other more general things ( such as recruitement of cops etc. . . ) : more means for intelligence services , strike them at home , fight against recruitement channels , creation of specific high security jails for returning djihadis where they would have no contact with the outside world and they would not be mixed with non radicalized inmates https://en-marche.fr/emmanuel-macron/le-programme/securite can translate more later if people want to know more but i am raiding in wow at the moment . 
  i think the opposite honestly . 
  we must have sympathy for them because they are desperate people who live in poverty and fell prey to an extremist party because other parties kept letting them down . 
  i am from picardy which is the deep north too and some places are just tragedy after tragedy , factories closing all the time to get moved to eastern europe and people finding themselves out of a job after 30 years in the same factory and with no other marketable skill etc. . . 
  these people experience all the worst aspects of eu without reaping any advantages in term of developpement . 
  shortly after the movie got out paris ultras made a banner saying [ `` pedophiles , unemployed , inbred : bienvenue chez les ch ` tis '' ] ( http://cdn2-europe1.new2.ladmedia.fr/var/europe1/storage/images/europe1/sport/la-banderole-de-la-honte-295898/6265082-1-fre-fr/la-banderole-de-la-honte.jpg ) to welcome racing club de lens fans . 
  it made quite an uproar in france as people thought it was very tasteless . 
  i thought it good banter between fans but i just love banter between football fans . 
  i remember another from lyon fans to st etienne fans `` while your fathers were dying in coal mines , ours were inventing cinema '' . 
  it 's actually a thing : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_bolshevism, 
  forgot this one . 
  i am going to add it . 
  thanks . 
  anything north of paris : unemployed , incestuous and alcoholic kiddy fiddlers brittany : all of them are bearded fishermen with strange names ending in - ec such as le dantec or le kervennec . 
  definitly alcoholics . 
  alsace / lothringen : could as well be germany marseille = fallujah with more douchebaggy car tuning paris : rude and pompous morons who think their farts smell like roses , like to add english words when they speak to show how cooler than you they are center : no one lives there , volcanos lyon : rich city , cold people , amazing food corsica : mafiosi and / or terrorists . 
  herd sheeps when they are not busy being mafiosi or terrorists . 
  very proud and taciturn , very warm when they get to know you . 
  basically just look at labels . 
  the pourcentage of hazelnut should be as high as possible and there should be no palm oil . 
  i really [ `` nocciolata '' from the brand `` rigoni di asiago '' ] ( http://www.rigonidiasiago.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/nocciolata1.jpg ) for example . 
  i am always scared people would think i am ordering a `` cock '' . 
  same with beach , there is pretty much no difference for a foreigner . 
  people have tried saying both but i just ca n't hear it . 
  i love it personally, 
  that may be but he still rose to power in germany . 
  yeah , totally get that . 
  mussolini was n't a mistake ? 
  especially when so many deaths were from fln death squads which mass murdered and burnt any village that was not 100 % supporting independance . 
  the atroticities in algeria were really 50 / 50 honestly . 
  not really . 
  if it 's done in a historically accurate way i acknowledge that it happened but do n't expect me to apologize for it since i had nothing to do with it . 
  oh god , the hypocrisy . 
  hitler only became an asshole in germany . 
  he left austria a vagrant and a failed artist . 
  things i love to spread : * [ confiture de lait ( called dulce de leche eslewhere apparently ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dulce_de_leche ) * [ chestnut spread ] ( http://www.simplygourmand.com/chestnut-spread/ ) , i especially love it on cr\u00eape with just a bit of maple syrup , the result is godly , you can also put it in plain yogurt . 
  as a child i would eat it directly with a spoon . 
  * jam , especially cherry and raspberry but we generally eat it alone , we do n't really mix it up . 
  * [ ovomaltine ] ( https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/htb19wvskpxxxxamxxxxq6xxfxxxw/ovomaltine.jpg ) a chocolate spread with crunchy cereals in it . 
  it 's just so fucking good . 
  * nutella i do n't hate pb , ate it occasionally but it 's just not my favorite option . 
  there are way better chocolate and hazelnut spreads than nutella . 
  nutella is great of course but there are similar spreads with more hazelnuts and no palm oil and it 's just more delicious . 
  if i remember correctly the transition from communism to capitalism has been very poorly done in russia , giving us today 's russia . 
  shame really , on one hand i think they need to be confronted when they do stupid shit , on the other hand i really want to see them succeed and be a force for good . 
  not possible under putin obviously . 
  i am happy to be french and i think all in all we mostly try our best to do good in the world . 
  i would definitly fight for my country if it was directly attacked by another country ( highly unlikely i know ) . 
  that being said i do n't look down on other countries , i am very curious by nature and i think culture shocks make us richer intellectually . 
  i especially like italy which i consider a bit like a second home . 
  i speak italian fluently and i just love their cuisine and culture .
