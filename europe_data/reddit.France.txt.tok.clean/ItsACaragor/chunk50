  exactly like with the plane shot down by the separatists . 
  sure , except we had to force russia to use its veto first . 
  it would have been an implicit admission of guilt . 
  it 's not about the veto . 
  of course russia would have vetoed it . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  he should have waited for russian veto . 
  now he looks like an idiot bombing people on a temper tantrum, 
  there is one good point though , my putin-loving ~ ~ racist ~ ~ politically incorrect facebook friend that i keep around for entertainment is fucking mad . 
  he supported trump since the start and now he makes `` yuge '' facebook posts saying he is now siding with islamic state , betraying putin and the likes . 
  nope , my girlfriend is very much into [ corgi races ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpukyevsfzy ) though . 
  you are being a bit unfair here . 
  us hardly started anything in syria , it has been at war for years . 
  europe 's birthrate is not a result of people not knowing how to meet people , it is mostly a result of people having other priorities and not bothering with relationships and children because of career . 
  not necessarily for or against it but it is brash and reckless . 
  he should have waited for the investigation results or at least for an hypothetic russian veto . 
  ordering missile strikes like that without any information is a dangerous precedent . 
  no , believe it or not , not everything we do has to do with the us . 
  i would say it is just common sense . 
  21 is nuts and completly unenforceable , 18 is a good age i think . 
  i am sure it has benefits but i never tried it myself . 
  we are extremely not libertarian . 
  we have high taxes , strong welfare state and a very strictly enforced secularism . 
  basically the us believe that freedom from religion is less important than freedom of religion and france believes the exact opposite . 
   you are highly unlikely to be bashed or threatened at all ; but they can be very arrogant to foreigners , and insults and discrimination do happen . 
  you 'll meet heaps of nice and welcoming people there , but not everybody - there will be those there who wo n't respect you . 
  be prepared for a mix of the two things . 
  it is worth mentioning sure but that just goes without saying that there are assholes . 
   one thing that i will say in their favour is that if you just treat them as any others and carry yourself in a respectful manner , most will return to you the favour . 
  once again that kind of goes without saying , does n't it ? 
   do n't go banging on about the fact that you are a ` brown person ' - that is seen as typical us-style racialised attitude . 
  that is actually a great remark . 
  race is not as big a thing as in the us . 
  the immigration problems here are mainly cultural clashes and have very little to do with race . 
  as long as op does not walk around in djellaba he should have no problem whatsoever . 
  and even if he did he would still have little problems . 
  fuck yeah , lampredotto is delicious and i had the chance to taste the one in mercato centrale , it is great indeed . 
  merde : illustrates both our contrarian mindset and our pessimism, 
  they absolutly do it . 
  i lived with italian roommates for six months during my erasmus in florence and when i got back to france i was doing it too from seeing them do it so much . 
  funny , the first napoleon related painting that came to my mind was [ `` le sacre de napol\u00e9on '' ] ( http://wpetab.ac-reunion.fr/alizes/wp-content/uploads/sites/106/2015/02/sacre-3.jpg ) , but i guess napol\u00e9on crossing the alps is a totally acceptable answer too . 
  no way . 
  we won it we keep it !, 
  cities in alsace really do feel german . 
  corsica and sardinia are pretty difficult to tell apart . 
  basque country spreads over two countries . 
  lille feels very flemish , for good reasons too , we still call it `` the capitale of the flanders '' in france . 
  brittany and wales could pretty much be the same country . 
  they even have the exact same anthem . 
  also i remember going to see italy-france in milan and you had people from nice cheering for france and people from nizza on the italian side cheering for italy . 
  i found it quite funny . 
  we can give you guyane if you want . 
  shame about the us , they are really trying !, 
  he is taking the piss . 
  it 's not necessarily reasoned , we tend to be pessimistic as a people . 
  it 's a beautiful song about ireland and its people, 
  the ultra short version would be that gaullism advocates for the union of the nation behind a strong figure supported by efficient political insitutions . 
  all that with a humanist goal . 
  its central tenets are centralization of the state , sovereignty , universalism and solidarity with the poor . 
  gaullism could go in that category probably and calling themselves `` gaullist '' always seem to be a plus for a politician . 
  the streets were clean, 
  yeah it is heard but you would more often ask for 500 grammes . 
  let me know when you ding level 84, 
  * \u00catre b\u00eate \u00e0 manger du foin = to be `` hay-eating stupid '' * peser un poids de voleur = to weigh as much as a thief ( i assume because the thief has tons of misplaced property over his person ) * il a pas invent\u00e9 l'eau chaud / le fil \u00e0 couper le beurre = he did not invent hot water / the butter slicer = he is not the sharpest tool in the shed * se faire chier comme un rat mort = to be as bored as a dead rat * pisser dans un violon = to piss in a violin = a complicated and utterly useless endeavour * il ne faut pas pousser m\u00e9m\u00e9 dans les orties = do n't push grandma in the urtica bush = do n't push it * prendre le taureau par les cornes = to grab the ox by its horns = to tackle an issue head on * il veut le beurre , l'argent du beurre et les faveurs / le sourire / le cul de la cr\u00e9mi\u00e8re = he wants the butter , the butter 's money and the dairywoman 's favours / smile / ass = he wants to have his cake and eat it too, 
  also education . 
  as people get more educated and especially women they tend to bear less children especially if they start getting careers of their own . 
  yeah i do n't know if it was the cultural gap or something but i did not really find it funny . 
  oh yeah i think it was that . 
  my italian roommates loved this show . 
  does italian tv still do the thing where in the middle of a tv show a group of women in skimpy clothes appears from nowhere and dances for a minute then everyone claps and the tv show gets back to normal ? 
  i was always like `` hey what the fuck , the guy was in the middle of making a point !, 
   `` naked is evil because of jesus '' what an hypocrite , everyone knows the guy [ loved to tan on the nude ] ( http://www.wilgafney.com/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crucify.jpg ) occasionally, 
  hollande was honestly not terrible . 
  he did not change much and just kept the steering wheel for a while and to me he did okey . 
  he got a lot of hate because he did not really do what he promised his electorate and he is not particularly charismatic and often sounds indecisive or goofy but honestly i do n't think he will go down as the worst thing we ever voted in office . 
  i would n't know . 
  i personally do n't care about any of this . 
  depends on the country but a lot of countries do it in eu . 
  because they do n't think of themselves as intolerant , they just think they are realistic people . 
  as the old saying goes : `` we judge others on their actions and ourselves on our intentions '', 
  you mean hell has infinite supply of meatballs ? 
  sign me in !, 
  it is not bastille day though . 
  it is both storming of the bastille and the day of the federation , celebration of the peace between all segments of french people after all the unpleasantness . 
  [ `` well ... whadya know !, 
  '' ] ( https://youtu.be/axzsqwpygpi?t=1m6s ), 
  * jlailu = reddit ( `` je l'ai lu '' literally means `` i read it '' in french ) . 
  dark uniforms and torches always look cool . 
  what is your opinion on [ big ass cloaks ? 
  ] ( http://s-www.ledauphine.com/images/1c79b5ce-113b-4825-9c32-65cc68d1025a/ldl_v0_12/le-colonel-pinon-a-la-tete-de-ses-differents-escadrons-1420349035.jpg ), 
  i did that . 
  roadtripped in the south west of the us for 21 days with some friends . 
  it was fun . 
  yeah we have great engineer schools . 
  [ eu superheroes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfgd_qyhdo ), 
  oss 117 , both of them . 
  they are awesome comedy flicks , very funny with great nonsensical french humour . 
  i do n't know how well the jokes would translate though . 
  it has not been enforced for a long time , it is a law from another time . 
  it 's shit and i do n't pay licence fee because i do n't have a tv ( by choice ) .
