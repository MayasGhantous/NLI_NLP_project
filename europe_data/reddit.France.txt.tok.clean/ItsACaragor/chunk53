  come on guys , we are better than that . 
  i googled it and apparently you are right . 
  what 's with the names though ? 
  i want scotland to be independant so we can resume our alliance against the king of england and invade them from the north and the south at the same time just like old time . 
  and the way you are thinking is exactly the root of the problem . 
  vermin supreme, 
  i agree with the rest , but i never heard of eastern europe being `` weak '' . 
  he does not have much chances of being elected anyway so we are purely dealing with hypotheticals . 
  i do that when i play online because i am always scared of [ my steam profile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8frb56m.jpg ) not being clear enough . 
  hey in france too . 
  kevin has become a short for `` that annoying kid who fucked everyone 's mom on online games '' . 
  if we can reform it then there wo n't be any problem . 
  you know there is a sentence i heard somewhere that really sticked with me : `` the european union will either be reformed by the left or destroyed by far-right '' . 
  and i deeply believe that , a lot of people are getting increasingly fed up with how it works . 
  a lot of them may not yet be fed up enough for voting souverainist parties but just give them a few more years . 
  the danger of wilder may be gone this time , le pen will or will not pass no one can know for sure but the two round system give her little chance of actually seeing power . 
  one thing i am absolutly certain though of is that be it now or in a decade eu will disappear if it continues the way it is going now . 
  i absolutly love the potential of eu , i consider myself a federalist of sorts and if we have to threaten with the nuclear option to force a reform that may give it a chance to see 2030 , then i guess it is a small harm for a greater good . 
  and if the perspective of one of its founding members leaving is not enough to push it to question itself then it is a sinking ship anyway as far as i am concerned . 
  bahn-mis are getting kind of popular where i live though . 
  fresh baguette and asian food , what 's not to like ? 
  i guess it depends if you think that the current form of eu is the only form possible . 
  lepen is against eu out of principle because she is a soverainist who refuses to see any sovereignty deleguated to another body . 
  melechon is not against the principle but thinks eu in its current form is too business oriented and not democratic enough and he wants to change it . 
  there is a huge difference between both these positions . 
  m\u00e9lenchon does not want to frexit , he just thinks it may be necessary if eu refuses to reform . 
  fillon vs le pen at second round is pretty much everyone 's nightmare right now . 
  best case scenario `` crooked '' fillon gets elected , worst case scenario it 's the nutcase . 
  yeah , this is an interesting election to be sure . 
  i just hope it would be less eventful though since there is so much at stake . 
  i do n't doubt hamon 's sincerity for one second but i do n't trust his party one bit . 
  it is no mystery that his election in the ps primaries was not taken well by the ps big wigs who wanted valls ( who holds more centrist views ) to be candidate . 
  since then they basically undermine him more or less subtly any chance they get to get macron in power instead of him despite him being their official candidate because macron better reflects their social democrat views . 
  a lot of them even openly defected to macron because hamon is too far left for them , despite the fact that the people voted for hamon to be the ps candidate . 
  basically the ps is in a big crisis and i do n't think they will easily come back from that . 
  i kind of hope hamon would just say `` okey fuck you guys '' to his party and rally behind melenchon but it is probably not going to happen . 
  that would be great because , even if he is loathed by the ps big wigs , hamon still has the support of a lot of ps sympathizers and together they could be expected to do pretty good . 
  haha , it is a well known fact that a lot of french people on reddit are hardcore front de gauche fans . 
  i wish people would talk more about them . 
  pro-eu people need to show they exist now more than ever . 
  scotland because of shared history . 
  germany could be cool too with both languages as official languages, 
   bein is more popular with ** soccer ** fans . 
  i beg your pardon ? 
  diversity is not necessarily a desirable trait though . 
  people in france are mainly interested in football and rugby . 
  he is very unpopular in france though so that may be why . 
  you might very well think that / u/jonahmilo , i could not possibly comment . 
  i think bein sports is more popular but i do n't have any figure to support that , just my impression . 
  i guess he is for the freedom of nations or someone like that . 
  there is a difference between respecting someone and worshipping him . 
  i respect our army , they have a hard and dangerous job and i acknowledge that . 
  that being said i do not worship them . 
  yeah we used to do that too , never ended well . 
  the main ones from right to left : *** front national ( fn ) *** : far right , souverainist , anti-eu , strict control of immigration , generally socially conservative but some of the dirigeants of the party are more progressive than others . 
  i do n't think the heads of the party are overtly fascist / racist but a lot of their long time voter base is and probably a part of their low level elected officials too . 
  *** les r\u00e9publicains ( lr ) *** : good ole conservatives . 
  they range from center right to pretty conservative right ( fillon is definitly among the most conservative ) . 
  they are generally pro-eu and pro-business and can be pretty conservative socially ( fillon is ostensibly wooing the very conservative , hardline catholics ) . 
  they are the most `` pro-austerity '' party economically . 
  *** en marche *** : macron 's party . 
  he basically tries to `` break '' the usual party system . 
  he is pretty much the most pro-eu candidate . 
  he is very pro-business and very socially progressive too if i understand well . 
  some people think he is a populist who is just wooing everyone at once and do n't really believe in anything except his very pro-business stance . 
  *** parti socialiste ( ps ) *** : social democrats . 
  economically they are basically the same as lr with a few difference here and there , the main difference is that they are generally socially progressive . 
  *** front de gauche ( fdg ) *** : the main party actually on the left of the political spectrum . 
  they are not full on communists , they mainly want to preserve workers ' rights and are against unchecked financial capitalism . 
  they are very socially liberal and very pro new technologies . 
  they are not against eu but want to negociate with the other eu countries to modify the treaties so eu is fairer and more democratic for everyone as they believe eu in its current form is mainly a tool for the big businesses who can influence it . 
  if these negociations fail to happen or no agreement is found they plan to make a referendum for an exit from eu but it would only be a plan b , they are not anti-eu in principle , they just do n't like eu in its current form . 
  they are against austerity economically . 
  if it can help , a distant relative of mine worked for [ thal\u00e8s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thales_group ) for a while . 
  i am not sure whether he specifically worked in their defense department but he is an engineer in electronics and his degree is from the [ enseeiht toulouse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enseeiht ) . 
  i doubt you have a single degree dealing with military rocketry , you pretty much have to specialize in one of the aspects of it and work on it as part of a team with different skillsets . 
  i am not sure you can apply in this kind of industry if you are not a citizen though , since those are pretty sensitive industries where you get to know military secrets and the likes . 
  define success . 
  if success for you is defeating the hilariously outdated north korean army using modern weapons and tactics then sure . 
  if success is installing a stable and democratic government in the long term this is much more doubtful , especially since the us are the nazis as far they are concerned . 
  [ here is how entire generations of north korean children have been raised to see the us ( nsfw ) ] ( http://www.theblaze.com/news/2013/07/19/north-korean-anti-u-s-propaganda-is-about-a-unsettling-as-youd-expect/ ) . 
  now imagine you have this image of another country ( let 's say nazi germany ) and suddenly this country invades yours saying they are going to liberate you . 
  would you just take their word for it and accept the new regime they say will be better for you or would you assume that they are here to conquer you and install a puppet regime and fight it with all your strength ? 
  we do n't even have to speculate , we already know because how these things go because that 's what happened and keeps happening in the middle-east . 
  i am not saying we should do nothing , just that military intervention will pretty much never result in a successful change of regime once a regime had the chance to indoctrinate several generations of people . 
   is this true ? 
  if not , our next hypothetical is that hitler is gassing the jews , but he never invaded poland . 
  not really comparable , hitler had been in power for six years when he invaded poland . 
  most german people knew what germany was before hitler and they could therefore easily go back to a democratic regime . 
  nk 's regime has been in power in an uninterrupted way since 1948 . 
  it means that entire generations of children have been born and educated by the regime and became adults in age of bearing arms . 
  this is not something you will just delete with a few bags of rice and packs of chewing gums . 
  if you want to make this comparison we are currently in an alternate reality where ww2 ( korea war ) ended and hitler ( kim ) and his descendants have been in power for 70 years . 
  we had a shot at removing hitler ( kim ) militarily before the damage was done and we blew it , now 70 years later military intervention would probably do more harm than good and we have to resort to other ways . 
  in north of france yeah . 
  in the rest of france i am not sure but i do n't think so . 
  i am not 100 % sure what you mean but `` mec '' is a pretty common way to colloquially call someone in france . 
  some arabic people sometimes call people `` fr\u00e8re '' ( brother ) too . 
   true or false : it would be `` illegitimate '' to intervene militarily . 
  it 's a tricky question but i would generally tend to say `` do not do it '' .
