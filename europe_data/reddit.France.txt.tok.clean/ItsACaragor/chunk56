  and rapists of course , how else would i remember how many women i have raped without my rape-tattoos ? 
  i understand that you are mainly trying to insult islam as a whole and therefore may not care much about actual facts and it 's okey , i would nevertheless like to build up on your comment if you do n't mind : * himmler ( and probably other nazi leaders ) did have a keen interest for islam , he thought that a literal interpretation of islam could create fearless warriors whose only wish was to die a martyr for his cause and that was admirable to him . 
  that being said using that to categorize all the islamic world would be unfair , it was just classical cherry picking from himmler based on a select number of texts , just like what isis does today . 
  i know it is a worn as fuck argument but the bible says that you should stone your woman if she is not a virgin on the day of her marriage . 
  the huge majority of muslims will react exactly like your or me if you threaten their lives regardless of what some cherry picked texts say . 
  * while some muslims served nazi germany dutifully ( the handschar ss division and the free arabian legion from the top of my brain , there probably are others ) , the huge majority of muslims fighting in ww2 were on the allied side , mainly because the axis side had very few / no colonies and a lot of them served with extreme bravour . 
  runes were used as symbols for ss divisions and to describe some core values of nazism during ww2 and as such are pretty often used by neo-nazis in france and elsewhere . 
  here is a little non-exhaustive chart of some [ ss divisions symbols ] ( http://www.ragauian.cz/wp-content/uploads/wehrmacht-and-ss-panzer-divisions-and-their-emblems.jpg ) to give you an idea . 
  [ odal ( which the nazis considered as a symbol of blood purity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/runic_letter_othalan.svg/220px-runic_letter_othalan.svg.png ) , [ tiwaz ( often used instead of the cross as sepultures for ss soldiers ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/tiwaz_rune.svg/926px-tiwaz_rune.svg.png ) and [ gibor ( das reich division symbol ) ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-03v5pxnknxc/vvgcxjdiwgi/aaaaaaaaanm/-e_ooxqvazu/s1600/0gibor.jpg ) seem the most popular among our neo-nazis friends but i would generally tread very carefully with any rune tattoos . 
  alas i guess it is yet another one of those things that nazis ruined for everybody . 
  `` practical '' is what i would probably say about english . 
  it is pretty easy to learn and it is spoken everywhere . 
  posh english is pretty funny , i am currently watching house of cards uk and i love [ francis urquhart 's ways to speak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqpkvkhu4ta ) , it sounds arrogant and distinguished at the same time . 
  can confirm , am pretentious as fuck . 
   in several cities you ca n't walk outside without a t-shirt i actually like that one . 
  i hate people walking shirtless outside of the beach . 
  * you ca n't call your pig napoleon . 
  * ovnis are not allowed to fly over the city of chateauneuf du pape * until 2011 the state of emergency still included both mainland france and algeria despite algeria being independant since 1962 ( sounds more like an overlook ) * the granville beach is forbidden to elephants * it is forbidden to introduce alcohol in your workplace , with the exception of cider , beer and wine * everyone needs to keep a stack of hay in their home in case the king passes in the neighborhood and needs to feed his horse * the mayor of sainte-gemme-sur-loire has issued a decree allowing santa klaus ' reindeers to graze freely on the territory of the city during the christmas period ( this an actual law even though it is more tongue in cheef than really absurd ), 
  that 's pretty much impossible to just cite one without a more precise question , especially since they are used in different ways : i love melted reblochon in a good tartiflette i love roquefort sauce with a good rare rumsteack or any other red meat a slice of comt\u00e9 or cantal with fresh baguette is awesome when you need to eat fast goat cheese in a pasta gratin is awesome , also in a pie with cherry tomatoes parmesan in pretty much any pasta dish etc , etc. . . 
  love some shropshire coupled with a good apple . 
  makes for a very tasty snack . 
  i would say more pop . 
  ma\u00eetre gims is reputed in france for being rap for people who do n't know shit about rap . 
  terrible people though . 
  they pretty much said plainly that they were homophobic . 
  yeah . 
  i am from the north and that 's definitly the best equivalent . 
  fn also progresses there too , albeit partly for different reasons . 
  i live in lyon , we got tourists from pretty much everywhere . 
  there seem to be a sizable number of italians but i do n't know if they are tourists or living here since we have a sizable italian community . 
  i sometimes hear eastern european languages ( russian possibly ) occasionally . 
  haha . 
  the new piaf . 
  that 's a good one . 
  i strongly identify with the imperium of humanity . 
  we will crush the xenos under our treads and purge the heretics with fire . 
  true also . 
  yeah i do n't hate u2 but bono is an immediate turn-off . 
  i just loath him for some reason . 
  zaz and ma\u00eetre gims too are often ridiculed . 
   france is a more expensive option but it has that distinct southern france fantasy going on in the south , it is beautiful and very touristy as well , though i am not entirely sure the locals ' english is brilliant \\  implying half the people living there are not british pensioners . 
  star wars galaxies , at the time they had no dedicated server , all were english speaking servers . 
  as i played a totally non-combat character focused on trade with other players i made huge progress in a matter of a few months . 
  i basically learnt english by finding suppliers , designing and producing clothing and selling it in bulk to a big shopping center specialized in wookie gear . 
  my supplier of raw materials was danish , i am french and the owner of the shopping center was from the us if i remember well . 
  no i do n't think it is useful or desirable . 
  some people just want to believe in something and they should have the right to do so in an organized way if they want under the condition that their practices submit to the laws of the country and that they just live their lives and not bother anyone with their beliefs . 
  geographically but we also share cultural similarities . 
  brittany , a part of france , is one of the six [ `` celtic nations '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_nations ) . 
  i intended my response to you was intended mainly as a joke though , i have no idea who copied who . 
  if i had to make a guess i would say saint patrick in france has been pushed by guinness to boost their sales and notoriety and people just enjoyed the idea . 
  we are closer to ireland than they are . 
  i prefer to think that they are imitating us imitating the irish !, 
  oh , thanks for this . 
  it is an interesting read . 
  if you have some time on day feel free to check it out it is a pretty good tv show . 
  we have this public organization called crous ( centre r\u00e9gional des \u0153uvres universitaires et scolaires ) which offers student lodgings and restaurants allowing students to live on the cheap near to where they study . 
  the quality of said lodgings and restaurants can vary but they are generally adequat in my experience . 
  my bad then . 
  i am watching house of cards uk and it often sounds like being seen as a socialist is pretty damaging . 
  saint patrick is often celebrated by drinking here and to a much lesser extent halloween . 
  that 's pretty much all . 
  not in france . 
  this is more a us / uk thing as far as i know . 
  we did not have the whole red scare propaganda that marked entire generations in your countries . 
  communist parties of today mostly do n't hold the same views as ussr . 
  speaking for france they mainly stand for worker 's rights , social progress and against class divides . 
  they do not want a stalinist government or anything like that . 
  it 's a common joke in france too . 
  tarte tatin ( upside down apple pie with caramelized apples ) with thick cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ( my favourite dessert in the world ) . 
  for the dish i would probably choose a hearty , comfort food dish such as cassoulet ( a stew from the south-west ) , tartiflette ( a potato gratin with reblochon cheese ) or aligot-saucisse ( a kind of cheesy puree commonly sided with a mountain sausage ) . 
  yeah , forgot about him . 
  de lesquen would definitly be like that . 
  he is a true mememaster too . 
  he is . 
  he is probably the only french politician who would kick my ass in a straight fight . 
  jean marie lepen used to be a bit like that except jmlp was very educated and a great speech maker who spoke a beautiful french . 
  it is true , but i would say / r/askeurope is somewhat more open to debate as long as it is well articulated with actual arguments . 
  if his tv channels are anything to go by i would say definitly yes . 
  tremendous guy . 
  very successful . 
  a nine seats thingy [ like that ] ( https://www.sixt.fr/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_renault-trafic-van-blau-2011_3747477163.png ) . 
  apart from that i drive a old as fuck renault twingo . 
  i barely use it though , i often toy with the idea of ditching it to be honest . 
   i said to myself `` it must be worse in europe . '', 
  can you expand on that ? 
  haha you ca n't beat churchill 's quotes . 
  i remember the one where de gaulle asked him why he had to wear this ridiculous bow tie and churchill turned and said `` not everyone can dress like the unknown soldier '' . 
  you guys sure showed us the way !, 
  you already see yourself as her kinky pa , do you ? 
  while i think she is hot as fuck , she would be terrible for france . 
  she represents the conservative wing of a far right party . 
  she is anti-eu and pretty much against any social progress , including abortion and gay rights . 
  she is not head of state though . 
  i did that too and went to firenze , it 's a pretty awesome city and you have ways to go there very easily from bologne . 
  marion mar\u00e9chal le pen ( fn , far right ) is pretty damn good looking : https://www.challenges.fr/assets/img/2015/08/28/cover-r4x3w1000-578e958754ca2-marion-marechal-le-pen.jpg https://www.challenges.fr/assets/img/2015/05/26/cover-r4x3w1000-5790a754a6610-regionales-marion-marechal-le-pen-sera-bien-candidate-en.jpg on the opposite side of the political spectrum , i really like najat vallaud belkacem ( ps , center left ) , current ministry of education : http://resize1-parismatch.ladmedia.fr/img/var/news/storage/images/paris-match/actu/societe/najat-vallaud-belkacem-l-institution-soutiendra-les-parents-741580/7709260-1-fre-fr/najat-vallaud-belkacem-l-institution-soutiendra-les-parents.jpg http://static1.puretrend.com/articles/1/11/11/81/@/1297698-najat-vallaudbelkacem-agrave-son-580x0-1.jpg rama yade ( lr , right ) , is pretty good looking too : http://imworld.aufeminin.com/story/20130223/rama-yade-3036_w1000.jpg for the men i asked my girlfriend and she said laurent wauquiez ( lr , right ) even though she hates him : http://cdn3-europe1.new2.ladmedia.fr/var/europe1/storage/images/le-lab/selon-jerome-lavrilleux-laurent-wauquiez-etait-au-courant-de-l-affaire-bygmalion-avant-les-revelations-du-point-19638/426330-1-fre-fr/selon-jerome-lavrilleux-laurent-wauquiez-etait-au-courant-de-l-affaire-bygmalion-avant-les-revelations-du-point.jpg macron ( en marche ! ), 
  even though she hates him too : http://www.entreprise.news/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/macron.jpg she said hamon ( ps , center left ) was not bad looking too : http://www.lepaysmalouin.fr/files/2016/12/hamon-630x0.jpg, 
  yeah in death valley california . 
  it was about 45 \u00b0 c when i was there . 
  getting out of the car felt like when you open your hot oven to check on your roast and get blasted in the face with a wave of heat and then you immediatly start to sweat profusely no matter how little you moved .
