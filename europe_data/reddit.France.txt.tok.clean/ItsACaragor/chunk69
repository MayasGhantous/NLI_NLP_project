   best of luck to you guys . 
  it is worth noting that in gastronomic restaurants you do get small portions but they are generally part of a five , six or more courses meal ( i have seen restaurants doing up to nine courses in a given meal ) . 
  i occasionally eat in gastronomic restaurants and i do n't remember a single time when i left and was still hungry . 
  and i honestly got a pretty decent appetite . 
  he sets a precedent . 
  whether it is a positive one or a negative one we will see in the incoming months but it definitly could affect the fn score in a non-negligible way ( positively or negatively ) . 
  you can be sure that if trump does well the fn wo n't pass on the occasion to say `` see , the american people did the right choice , let 's do this too '' . 
  fn never really talks about eastern european immigration . 
  their main talking point is islam . 
  same with antisemitism , it is far from certain that marine le pen is antisemitic . 
  her father probably was but in the case of mlp it is pretty debatable . 
  they do are pretty russophile , that much is certain and they are not hiding it . 
  i think it is unfair to label trump voters as just voting for the big mouth . 
  while it is certainly the case for some of them i think trump just succeded in gathering most of those unhappy with the establishement candidates we have been offered for decades and this is a dynamic that is very present in europe too . 
  the same causes producing the same effects it is pretty safe to assume we may see something similar here in the years to come we have seen that with brexit and trump is just another symptom of the same illness . 
  if we do n't that to happen our politicians really have to work hard on pleasing the discontent people but we know it just wo n't happen . 
  democratic party made a big mistake by rigging the primary election against bernie and putting a talking robot in its place . 
  bernie would have been able to do major damage to trump by robbing him of the discontent vote trump was counting on . 
  i think trump 's election will have a huge impact on french 2017 election . 
  if trump fucks up it is going to be a bad thing for fn and if trump is successful it will serve fn greatly . 
  haha i did not know we had that stereotype i always heard it about italians . 
  i checked the figures and it appears that you guys do slightly worse than us when it comes to casualties on the road . 
  that 's not my explanation . 
  it 's what law enforcement from numerous countries think . 
  once again i am not a specialist myself but it seems sensible enough . 
  says the guy from the only country in western europe with highways looking like african tracks . 
  i think it 's kind of a asshole thing to do to be honest . 
  i know a guy who liked to do it and i thought he was being a dick . 
  a british person speaking another language is always a rare thing . 
  odds were in his favor to be honest . 
  i am not really trying to spark a debate . 
  i was just explaining the rationale behind it . 
  it 's mainly for the cop 's safety . 
  a violent person ca n't do shit if they are strapped to their seat . 
  why though ? 
  there is a reason you should stay in your car unless instructed otherwise during pull overs . 
  currently playing world of warcraft and witcher 3 and i love them both . 
  if i have to choose one game that made a huge impression on me it would probably be the very first half life . 
  i remember being absolut blown away by the atmosphere , graphics ( for the time they were gorgeous ) and story . 
  fallout 1 and 2 and the baldur 's gate series only bring great memories too . 
  haha my girlfriend is with you on this , she is in love with italy and with florence specifically since i made the mistake of bringing her there years ago . 
  yeah i hope it never happens . 
  the majority of our medias are private owned and therefore only reflect the views of those who own them . 
  i read them occasionally but i double check everything . 
  yeah russia is the country i really would like us to be friends with but i also completly understand why it 's just not possible at the moment . 
  i hope putin will just go one day . 
  we do n't have credit rating . 
  if we default on loans we will be banned from borrowing but apart from that they just look at your income to define whether you can borrow that sum or not . 
  yeah , you have to start borrowing money from a young age to have the right to borrow money later . 
  that 's crazy . 
  i would send [ shovel guy ] ( http://referentiel.nouvelobs.com/file/14546741.jpg ) . 
  this guy will fuck them up . 
  is it a tax haven ? 
  yes ? 
  you are okey in my book . 
  love it . 
  i am not into the `` got ta be ready for dem niggers when dey come to rape mah family '' bs but i shot a few handguns and smgs a while back and i really loved it . 
  i will probably do some recreational shooting at some point . 
  i had the occasion to shoot a few guns a while back , they greatly differ in the way they shoot and the sensation is just so different . 
  the difference between shooting a glock handgun and shooting an ak is like skiing and snowboarding . 
  it 's basically sliding on snow but all the rest is completly different . 
  considered a classic of french 80 's / 90 's rock . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxzmjqbfss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpy7fhvbg6a iam , great rappers , grew up on that shit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inud2d7r8bk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn_ujjn3yqu ntm are pretty good too from the same time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfqbydr6m4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbqhgwl0ntk, 
  it does . 
  the way we see it if you do n't fight for your rights as a worker the higher ups will shit on you anyway they can and why would n't they ? 
  they are just looking out for themselves just like workers do when they go on strike . 
  it does go overboard occasionally but for me it is the sign of a people who has not given up yet . 
  i did not say it had no impact , i just say we could have abstained from this . 
  there was no clear bad guy persecuting someone else or anything like that , it was just a clash of egos and nationalisms . 
  we still find unexploded ammo and dead people one hundred years later . 
  it is generally seen as a pointless war . 
  in rural europe you always need a car , most of the people who will comment about not needing a car will be right but will probably live in cities . 
  i live in lyon which is the third biggest city in france and my car is honestly just gathering dust . 
  i can go either by tram , bus or subway very fast to anywhere and i often go by foot just to enjoy the walk . 
  if i take my car it means i have to park it and it is either annoying to find a free space or expensive if i go to a paying carpark . 
  it is far from being as important as embracing french culture and traditions whole heartedly . 
  i do n't have much against people immigrating but if they are going to live exactly like in their country of origin i prefer they just go ahead and stay there . 
  is it ? 
  just a shitty pun, 
  iran , fitting choice for a frenchman, 
  additional example of titi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt_xlcgaado, 
  dat `` huuu '' at the end of every sentence ... 
  a good part of far right seems to like [ les lansquenets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urg12_nu11m ) in france . 
  loved the metro series , both the series and videogames . 
  i would say it depends but going apeshit over that would probably brand the girl as a `` crazy one '' here . 
  it depends on the compliment of course . 
  if you say to another girl `` damn girl you are so fucking hot '' in front of your girlfriend she probably wo n't like it but saying something like `` wow your new hairstyle really suits you '' to another girl is just completly normal and no one would bat an eye except maybe a few crazy girlfriends . 
  '' : * `` health , happiness and joy in your sister !, 
  '' * - probably my favorite when among friends , the original ( boring ) toast is `` sant\u00e9 , bonheur et joie dans vos coeurs '' ( `` health , happiness and joy in your heart '' ) . 
  '' : * `` to our horses , our wives and to those who mount them !, 
  '' * ( supposed to be an old cavalry troops toast but i have been unable to find any reliable source for that online ), 
   a ( bulgarian ) friend of mine lives in the netherlands , and she told me how , for example , it 's considered completely normal and okay if a boy tells to another girl that she has beautiful eyes or hair , basically - to make a compliment ( even if she indeed does have them ) , in front of his girlfriend . 
  what is the problem ? 
  is it something frowned upon in bulgaria ? 
  mostly protective equipment , to name an example they want fire retardant uniforms after an attack on cops with molotov cocktails that caused the death of an officer . 
  you mean [ him ] ( http://thumbshigh.koreus.com/201511/slipgate.jpg ) ? 
  the guy pretty much became a meme : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ctx_2nbwcaa1sns.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ctx2zh1wuaizson.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ctx2h2rwiaqkkwu.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ctx6oltweau-ybb.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ctyayjvw4aawptd.jpg, 
  by manage i of course mean to crush them into submission . 
  i enjoyed crusader kings 2 quite a bit too . 
  loved the part about managing your bloodline so you get to rule entire countries just because you married well two generations ago .
