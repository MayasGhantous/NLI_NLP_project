  i would really like to go to latin america but i fear i ca n't speak latin . 
  i made a post that may be of interest to you on / r/europe . 
  it may give you a part of the answer . 
  come visit us on / r/french if you need help with anything !, 
  native french , i speak english and italian fluently and i would like to speak russian , i have some basics but i am still far from conversational . 
   removing them would make things better how ? 
  extremists would n't give up their faith , just because we outlawed it . 
  / u/dnarg did not say they should be banned , he just said if they did not exist it would be better . 
  obviously banning them would not be a solution though . 
  yeah i mispoke , sorry for being misleading . 
  social justice warrior is a derisive term . 
  these people do n't actually care about social justice . 
  apart from the obvious , the fact that sarkozy is not only not in jail yet but a candidate to presidential elections . 
  i am really appalled by this sincerely . 
  it 's my impression as well but then i never did group tourism . 
  depends on the occasion . 
  1h would be over lunch in the scenario given by op . 
  sure , it can drag on a lot more than that . 
  depends what you mean by slow ? 
  the definition of slow varies a lot depending on countries . 
  in france it 's not unusual at all to take between one hour and one hour and a half to eat at a restaurant . 
  yeah pretty hard to break this tie . 
   more importantly , i think often the average of a bunch of `` random opinion '' is a good rough approximation of the truth yes and no . 
  if we keep the `` is your country racist '' example for example . 
  it is probably fair to say that the most accepting a country is , the more racist acts will tend to be widely reported because they are seen as particularly evil . 
  in the opposite a pretty intolerant country will greatly under report racist acts since they are seen as normal or even beneficial to society . 
  another example : more accepting countries will probably have more minorities for obvious reason , and therefore even if they have much less racist acts proportionally to their population and the number of people belonging to minorities than another less accepting countries , they will probably have more racist acts in raw number , hence giving the impression that the accepting country is much more racist than it is . 
  we could also imagine that minorities in less accepting countries will make a lot of efforts to hide their origins to avoid persecution which can , once again , contribute to lower racist acts toward them . 
  it 's only a few reasons from the top of my head on why we are terrible judges on these matters . 
  if we look at, 
  you say that like it 's a bad thing . 
  i call that an additional perk !, 
  your question is weird . 
  it makes it seem like you do n't know that uk is an island . 
  i assume it is not the case of course but it 's still very weirdly worded . 
  the problem is not you , it 's opinions in general . 
  asking `` in your opinion is your country racist '' is poorly worded if we want to be diplomatic and completly pointless if we actually want to be sincere , opinions are easily swayed and are heavily influenced by dozens of psychological factors such as confirmation bias or anecdotal evidence ( `` i saw black people get insulted a few times , my country is definitly the worse when it comes to racism '' ) . 
  literally everyone does that , whether they think they do or not . 
  our brain just sucks at that particular task . 
  opinions are only interesting when discussing abstract concepts or if we want to discuss perceptions vs reality . 
  but when it comes to factual reality they are , honestly , worthless . 
  it goes for your opinion but for mine too , hence why i do n't share it . 
  a good example of what i am trying to say is the link given by op : pages after pages of people giving their uninformed opinion about a topic they know nothing about and everyone upvoting opinions that correspond the best to what they want to believe is right . 
  a disagreement that would be based on nothing and that would therefore be fruitless . 
  yeah and people are pretty cool there generally speaking . 
  10/10 would ~ ~ annex ~ ~ visit again . 
  this sort of question generally means `` why are you happy '' more than actually being proud . 
  good thing is thanks to the brexit you will now be able to fund it like farage said !, 
  i may have been a tad too hopeful apparently, 
  yep . 
  it would be more interesting if op actually supported his argument . 
  mainly the philosophy of life . 
  the idea that work is only really important because it allows you to fund your leisurly time . 
  i do n't like that idea that is being pushed on us that work defines yourself as an individual and your place in society . 
  your family and what you do in your free time should be what matters . 
  if working my ass off allows me to see my family more , travel more or do cool things in my free time , sure count me in . 
  if it 's just to get to a higher status and to have a cool title , fuck off . 
  we get a lot of flack for striking regularly but i am actually proud that we resist to the constant reforms aiming at destroying quality of life in favour of always more money for stockholders . 
  i am sure some people will disagree and that 's okey . 
  everyone has different goals in life . 
  you are being ridiculous . 
  i think people here are more educated than on / r/funny . 
  well i hope anyway . 
  fixed , 
  ours contains the colour of paris ( red and blue ) added to the white of the kingdom of france . 
  i really like [ snowgoons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3okkaglvrs ) . 
  [ la caution ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mojzq8nf2dq ) is nice too . 
  pretty old but if you do n't know [ iam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inud2d7r8bk ) you should definitly check it out . 
  their album `` l'\u00e9cole du micro d'argent '' is my favorite french rap album of all time . 
  [ ntm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfqbydr6m4 ) is great too from the same era . 
  juste some baguette ham and butter . 
  only works if the bread is of good quality . 
  i know what putin did in ukraine and i understand we ca n't just let countries invade their neighbors and everything without sanctioning them but damn it sucks . 
  i really like russia 's culture and language . 
   i also do n't understand why some germans wear socks with sandals . 
  a german friend who has been living in france for a long time and is still rocking his socks / sandals combo as long as weather allows it : `` i do n't care how it looks , it 's just so fucking comfortable . '', 
  if that was the only example . 
  [ `` glaces \u00e0 l'italienne '' ] ( http://footage.framepool.com/shotimg/qf/208133049-machine-a-glace-glace-a-l'italienne-vendeur-de-glace-dysfonctionnement.jpg ) in france also this weird carbonara with sour cream some french people do . 
  wtf . 
  we have free speech , we just put the common good over it . 
  you do n't . 
  that 's a choice and both are defendable . 
  no need to be an asshole because you ca n't go to people and say that they are filthy kikes in europe . 
  that does not mean you can not discuss about actual important things . 
  you are free to think they are filthy kikes or to discuss with like minded people about the threat to society you think filthy kikes represent , you are just not allowed to go and insult people because you feel like being an asshole today . 
  do n't be pissed , every country on earth does that . 
  thank you for your service, 
  i never understood why you never sent [ zanger linus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u22gxrkbeyw ) , this guy is a national treasure and you would be assured to be in the top 3, 
  damn , every single french entry in recent years has been shitty except maybe [ les fatals picards ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1yp9h_les-fatals-picards-eurovision-2007_music?gk_facebook_og_html5=1 ) which was playing on clich\u00e9s and was extremely funny with their nonsensical frenglish . 
  i was with a group of friends in lyon one time , one of my friend had a friend of a friend who advised us this bar in lyon which was pretty cool apparently . 
  we arrive and the guy at the door asks us if we know anyone , we say the name of the guy my friend knew ( we thought it was pretty weird but whatever ) we enter the bar and a guy comes to us and say `` hey , my name is [ - ] , neonazi . '', 
  the guy said that to all of my friends as they entered . 
  i suggested it would be easier if he made himself a business card . 
  he laughed and paid us a vodka . 
  apparently this was a bar mainly patroned by nazis . 
  haha , here we say `` su\u00e9dois '' ( swedish ) or the `` auvergnats '' ( inhabitants of auvergne , a part of france ) . 
  why is it dangerous ? 
  they are not animals , it 's just a question of education . 
  germany : they are the polite neigbors , their sense of style is impeccable ( they are the inventors of the socks + sandal combo after all ) . 
  do n't understand why they love merkel so much to be honest , i think she is awful and has absolutly no charisma .
