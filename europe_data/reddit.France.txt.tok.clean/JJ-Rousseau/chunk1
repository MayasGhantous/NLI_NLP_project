first thing : new generation is coming and now more and more people know how to handle at least a basic conversation ( my parents do n't know how to speak english because german was taught when they were younger in school , so you 'll manage to communicate with them in your language ) . 
  second thing : i 'm pretty sure that if you go in some place as * ard\u00e8che * in holidays there will be more german and dutch than french . 
  nop it 's showing 2 . 
  edit : meh , seem 's hard to see the difference between green/yellow . 
  i thought it was 100 % yellow . 
  that 's so true . 
  my so is finnish and she 's moving there for this reason . 
  your country is n't funny :(, 
  my mother is a french teacher in a high-school in rh\u00f4ne-alpes ( 2 nd wealthiest part of france ) she ca n't get any access to internet neither to a laptop . 
  despite she would like to give interactive lecture or show video or , she ca n't . 
  yes i do ( source : my step-family is from finland i 'm going there really often ) . 
  remember that in france some school do n't even own a computer ... 
  i bet you 're from paris . 
  hahaha ... no population/tax/money of a country is not a linear function . 
  just for your information , in most high-school in france there is no internet nor computer . 
  the main reason is also that finland is a country of 5.5 millions people , we are 70 millions ... major issue is about money , not striking . 
  it 's not gay parade . 
  it 's called west-pride everybody can come and walk . 
  but for some historical reason there is a lot of people from the lgbt community . 
  this is how it look in [ sweden ] ( http://www.google.fr/url?source=imglanding&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://scandhouse.org/current/1306/images/eckerdal.jpg&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bm5uvf6ndupp7gbchodgca&amp;ved=0cakq8wc&amp;usg=afqjcnennykzpeptmcwuzbzzr2vfv_ldxq ) i remember being in g\u00f6teborg for the gay pride last year . 
  the church actually walk during the parade , there was priests ( i can totally remember the one on the photo ) , nuns , and lot of believers , they were carrying sign with caption : `` swedish church with lgbt '', 
  it 's not exactly `` rights of man '' it 's `` human rights '' the uppercase h means women and men ... 
  i was going to mention that number represent all the +18 men in finland . 
  but this is not french at all . 
  reminds me seven-eleven or the yellow one , do n't remember the name ( sybillia ? ), 
  they always have poster with this photo and wrote `` french hot dog '' on it, 
  i can already feel sweden < 3, 
  i know that in sweden they call the traditional hot-dog for : `` french hot-dog '' . 
  i really do n't think this is french . 
  which provider ? 
  i know that it 's usualy capped at 20go, 
  that explains why we have so much romanian here . 
  oh that 's sounds really hards especially if you need to pay a rent . 
  no problem for understanding mate !, 
  is the cost of life that cheap ? 
  or is it a real strugle to live with minimum wage ? 
  number 16 today , that 's too bad !, 
  [ i 'm laughing for this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bfbdupu.jpg ) . 
  but even for ham and cheese pizza , the ham does n't look like ham neither the cheese . 
  [ i mean this is not ham and cheese is under it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/pizza_hawaii_special_p%c3%a5_pizzeria_papillon_i_sala_1343.jpg ), 
  you do n't know how to make pizza in sweden . 
  cheese must be on the top of the pizza not on the first layer . 
  and i really do n't get the point of putting sauce/gravy on the top of it . 
  when i was leaving in sweden that was my disappointment : ca n't find any good pizza !, 
  that 's the best part of eu imo . 
  it 's so easy that you can believe it 's the same country . 
  except for uk where you have to go through customs . 
   english is much easier to learn for latin country . 
  we do hate them too . 
  but we have bullshit laws to protect french language ... 
  i do n't because i 'm a eu citizen . 
  i totaly agree , i do n't watch tv or go to cinema in france because of this . 
  [ this one even went viral ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvvy9an_pfq ), 
  just look at reddit scale . 
  everything is in english except subreddit regarding a country , and they are most often bilingual . 
  indeed i guess it 's to late to reverse . 
  they just do n't have enought people to dub every tv show or movie . 
  they have like 4 national channels , the rest tv show/series/documentary not dub of course . 
  ( if it 's not english or your mother tong then you 're screwed ) . 
  so you can watch tv/cinema in english just ignore swedish subtitles . 
  regarding groceries you can find info in swedish/english/danish / finnish usualy . 
  half of the lectures are taught in english ( mandatory english after bachelord level ) . 
  even in nightclubs and pubs i never had trouble to speak with bartender/bouncer/people . 
  i was doing sports and everybody just switched in english without i had to ask for explanations or translations . 
  not really if french was dominant i coud n't speak 2 languages . 
  i use to live in g\u00f6teborg , i never spoke swedish , i actually never saw someone unable to speak english ( only once a cashier in a small supermarket ) . 
  i was living as if i was in an english speaking country ( cinema , groceries , event , adds , info are in english ) . 
  so i 'll say swedish is more threaten by english than any other language . 
  maybe a part of france is spoiling this . 
  i do n't know how people could be happier in rhone-alpes actually . 
  we have great weather we can swim or ski even after working days , we have great food and not that much unemployement . 
  but i guess that is not true for all the region ( ie : picardie ), 
  i do have wine in my company restaurant . 
  i 've worked in the uk based company of my enterprise , the first thing that let us bewildered was uk lunch . 
  step 1 : go to tesca and buy sandwich step 2 : eat on your desk, 
  yeah knowing that they have one of the highest suicide rate in europe . 
  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/suiciderate.html http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/suicide/by-country/, 
  italy in europe , brazil otherwise, 
  from all my acquaintance i only know one person who 's going to the church on sunday . 
  he 's polish but lives in france . 
  he told me that he only sees olders and very few 40 's couples . 
  and when they do that they are saying `` we are going to shop in the third world '' or `` we are going to poor-land '' . 
  of course they will honk you if you do n't drive fast enough or doing something that they do n't like during their journey . 
  i live at the border between france and switzerland . 
  yeah those people are horrible . 
  always trying to tell you how your country is poor/stupid because it belongs in eu and how smart and rich they are because they do n't belong in the eu . 
  switzerland people spend their time to remind you how bad your country is until holidays when they are all coming in france because it 's way better/cheaper to spend your days in france, 
  you obviously do n't leave in haute-savoie . 
  here the first price for a 100m \u00b2 house is 600 000 euros . 
  so i guess i also have to give my opinion . 
  i am french i 've done my mt in chalmers ( g\u00f6teborg ) and my gf ( finnish ) done her mt in aalto ( helsinki ) . 
   if i remember correctly , finnish universities got 200 million euros less in funding , and they still work better than french ones . 
  finnish universities do n't `` work '' better , of course they do have nice infrastructures , lectures and a really good quality but the unemployment rate is higher in finland for people who own a bt/mt . 
  i guess french `` universities '' are better at putting student in the job market . 
   i think it 's also important to mention that french universities do not have the same prestige as their german or british counterparts . 
  this is really hard to mesure cause we do n't have the same vocabulary . 
  for instance chalmers is describe as a [ university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chalmers_university_of_technology ) in the world , but for us it 's a [ `` grande \u00e9cole d'ing\u00e9nieur '' ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89cole_polytechnique_chalmers ) . 
  my point is that it is really hard to say if all of this is true or false because it 's really hard to compare two systems . 
   pomme de terre that 's funny cause this is the knowest word for foreigners but actually nobody use it in france . 
  south east of france indeed , small city .
