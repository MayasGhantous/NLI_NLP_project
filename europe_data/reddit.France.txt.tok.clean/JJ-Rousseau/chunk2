  http://www.france24.com/en/20160815-corsica-tense-burkini-beach-brawl-france-muslim-islam i have a lot of french source but not a lot of english sorry, 
  my family flew from italy years ago because they thought mussolini was not doing something just and fair . 
  they came in france because french culture was what they were looking for and because french could offer them a nice place to live . 
  the same thing happen with maghrebian country but instead they refused all the culturale side of france and now they are doing provocation and non integration acts . 
  if you are flying away from your country it is not to live the same way that in your previous country . 
  coming to france with your religion ( yeah we can assume that islam is actually in france since 62 ' immigration wave ) and trying to bend the country to follow your rules ( ask for hallal food in school self , ask for replacement dishes in working cantines , ask for exam to be oustide ramadan period , ask people to be compliant with your religion , build mosque ... ) is 100 % bullshit . 
  yeah , because this is french culture i guess . 
  and there was never problem with this . 
  this law has been passed because there has been some tensions and problem with this particular clothes . 
  because people were getting assaulted in some beach , because it create tension and because there is a women 's right issue in it . 
  i do n't see your point . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_irreligion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irreligion#polls, 
  who the fuck are you to say most frenchmen ar n't giving a fuck about that ? 
  most of the people i know thinks it 's fucking stupid to wear a burkini or a burqa . 
  first you change the name of all the family member to something french . 
  then you make sure they ca n't speak their language at home or outside . 
  then you make it forbiden to teach the language to the children . 
  if we are removing the cultural part of france ( and the women rights problem veil raises ) , yes they should imo . 
  i do n't see the point , of course i 'll leave the country . 
  i hate religions , so i could n't leave in a country where law are make based on a bs book . 
  cross necklace is a cultural stuff and it 's not something that you spot from 100 meters away . 
  for the kippa it 's never happenned yet or it 's really uncommon : jurisprudence, 
  rarely displays for everyone to see . 
  that argument tho ... 
  it 's not a matter of what it hides , it 's a mater of what it displays . 
  she probably knew that we are a secular country and that we do n't like to show off religious sign . 
  if that 's the ** law ** and the ** culture ** i woudl n't . 
  if i would i would leave the country . 
  99 % of women wearing a burqa are tourist , this is what i meant . 
  not the other way around . 
  your first exemple is bad , if my country 's culture and law is to be topless , i 'll go topless without any doubts ... or leave the country . 
  not the same problem ( even if i think they are full of tard ' which ar n't usefull at all ) . 
  you know , i live in france and i had to forgot about my culture and my country to become integrate in france . 
  they should do the same . 
  french or not she has to respect the law . 
  if you do n't like your country 's culture then i suggest you to move away from it . 
  they are doing their jobs ... that woman was n't naked then so it is n't shaming . 
  in my french city there is a lot of women wearing burqa ( 99 % of tourist ) nobody is saying anything even if it 's strictly forbidden . 
  now the law is getting applied , that 's good . 
   city : geneva ( city of peace , science , and diplomacy ) meh , maybe i do n't know geneva enough but everytime i go there i 'm disapointed and i go back to annecy within an hour . 
  is there anything that is worth the journey , i mean , ok i saw the water flow and the lake but then ? 
  mt st michel is pretty overrated imo . 
  i can easily pick 50 places to see before this . 
  ( except if you are a architect lover ), 
  when i was in helsinki it was around -30 . 
  i was just running from an inside place to another inside place . 
  it actually hurt to be outside . 
  but maybe that 's because i 'm not use to this weather . 
  yeah but you have two solution : allow tv everywhere ( people split in all the pub and restaurant of the city ) . 
  create a fan zone . 
  in any case people will never stay home . 
  so by threatening pubs and restaurant you are actually making it worst , cause if there is 3 tv in the whole city people will gather around it . 
   what could have been better . 
  would be interesting to know . 
  in some region some politics prevent pubs/restaurant to put tv in their terace . 
  it was suppose to be for security purpose ... 
  in my town only three pubs dared to have a tv outside , obviously there were so many people standing up in the middle of the street that it could have been dangerous . 
  [ there was twice more people behind me \\ ( for only 1 tv not bigger than 1m \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zswoxvn.jpg ) there was no fan zone for each city so it 's probably better to split people by allowing tv everywhere ... that was the negative point for me . 
  yeah , once i wanted to buy bacon and cheese to make a quiche and i had to pay something like 15 euro for one pack of bacon , 200 gr of cheese and 4 eggs . 
  what is wrong with k-market ? 
  i do n't know if `` gun per habitant '' is an accurate statistic . 
  i mean , i have several guns for sports ( biathlon , shooting ... ) and my uncle also got several guns for hunt . 
  so we maybe have 10 guns for both of us . 
  so if we take my family we got 10 guns for 12 people . 
  but that does n't mean that 83 % of my family got a gun . 
  reminds me last time i was hanging around in my city with a friend . 
  a family stopped me and ask :  solly !, 
  ver iss madonaless ? '', 
  i was trying to figure out what is madonalesse , is that some kind of church or monument i do n't know in my city ? 
   - i 'm sorry i really do n't know this , what is it ? 
  - ma do na lesse the restaurant !!, 
  - i 'm really sorry i do n't know this restaurant . 
  madonaless ? 
  then i realized they were looking for a mcdonalds . 
  me and my friend are still bringing this to have a good laugh . 
  fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven and extremly short skirt yeah . 
  that was my first vision of sweden . 
  make camping great again, 
  camping-car , 90 % of them are from belgium and netherlands . 
  when i was a kid , i use to spend all my camping holidays with dutch people because i could n't find any french kid . 
  yeah but keep in mind that there is twice more people in paris than in norway . 
  it 's easier to find a job for everyone . 
  especially when your country is full of oil . 
  it actually could not be bad for norway . 
  france = ranska ? 
  i think that 's a major change . 
  you ca n't guess finnish are talking about france in the middle of a discussion . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's a good thing to know . 
  my post was sarcastic i know that every romanian are not in france just for money !, 
  we know that your country is really nice and that romania is a smooth place , 
  not sure if serious or ... 
  triggered . 
  wait till i come to helsinki i will show you some good cheese !, 
  hello my name is dimitri !, 
  do you play cs go or dota 2 ? 
  hey that 's my line . 
   i 'm going to be there next week , hoping it will be fixed by then !, 
  the water flow will certainly be but there is renovations on that building untill this summer . 
  i was watching arte 2 days ago and they said migrants were n't allowed to work for money .
