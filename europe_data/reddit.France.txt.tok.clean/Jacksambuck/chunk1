  `` i 'm sure you are , max . 
  but i got ta get payed . '', 
  the war , then the civil war , they earned their independance . 
  scotland otoh would have looked like a little bitch getting independent just for asking . 
  `` winning '' a centuries-long feud and quest for freedom because ... the other side thinks they should make their own decisions . 
  how romantic is that ? 
  for some reason , regions that find substantial oil want independence . 
  when they were part of the whole , they did n't mind getting part of resources that were n't theirs , but when it 's time for them to share with others , they find they had lots of nationalistic pride where the oil came from . 
  i do n't think putin wants the eu to rearm ... 
  he has no chance in an arms race , even less of a chance than in the reagan era . 
  he needs a militarily relatively weak eu to keep bullying the small neighbour states . 
   we should focus on our economies and work for better tomorrow , putin wants us to change priorities to make us weaker - do n't let him . 
  our economies are far stronger than his , both in absolute and per capita terms . 
  it would take decades of batshit all-out rearming before we reach russia 's shit economic position . 
  then we 'd have a tank per person and homelessness would be solved . 
  we can easily afford to rearm , which does n't mean that we should . 
  that 's not it . 
  king 's speech just sucks . 
  the woes of a boring , mildly retarded , arrogant aristocrat . 
  he thought he was going to live a life of passive luxury like his kind usually does , but it turns out he 'll be expected to say happy christmas on the radio once a year or so . 
  tough , but such is life . 
  what i got from it is that , while some people expect their leaders to lead and inspire , the english are ecstatic when theirs can finish a sentence . 
  i expect the spanish version , starring charles ii as he struggles to wipe his ass , to be a lot more fun . 
  yeah , plus , the propaganda had n't sufficiently transformed their `` ukrainian brothers '' into enemies to start shooting at them . 
  they need a little time to learn that they 've always been at war with ukrainia . 
  shit , new saxony is just london and some seaside south england property . 
  bavaria is a bunch of wealthy peasants . 
  oligarchs vs kulaks , if you will . 
  i think i remember the dutch state was basically created as protestant separatists against the catholic flemish ( - spanish ) state , so i suppose there 's some lingering bad blood/difference . 
  we french , otoh , being magnanimous , are content with annexing anything that ever spoke french , even a little . 
  i 'm looking at you , london , rhineland , half of africa and north america . 
  and it 's not like wallonia would drag us down economically , since we 're shit too !, 
  you 're really underestimating the us here . 
  they 're the only superpower left . 
  you think they 're just going to abandon allies , and therefore their hegemony and the stability that goes with it , just because some second-class regional power threatens them ? 
  they would basically be accepting third-rate power status if they did , and anyone could bully them . 
  this would be like a mighty and popular king voluntarily going into slavery because a peasant threatened to rebel . 
  also , the russians are not insane . 
  you do n't kick the head honcho unless you 're a masochist . 
  yes . 
  i do n't think i 'm waving my dick around . 
  i 'm not even that opposed to appeasement , they gave peace a chance , it did n't work out . 
  maybe if hitler died or came to his senses we could have avoided wwii thanks to appeasement . 
  there 's really no guarantee that hawkish behaviour would have given a different outcome . 
  the german commander quote about the german army collapsing in two weeks if the allies had attacked just looks like total bullshit . 
  arguably the strongest land army in the world at that time collapsing in two weeks at home against the army it completely crushed half a year later ? 
  yeah right . 
   if france would have attacked germany at the start of the war , france would have crippled germany . 
  do n't think so . 
  the french and brits were blitzkrieged to death in weeks in defensive positions . 
  it would have gone down even faster had their forces been outstretched in enemy territory . 
  inferior tactics , inferior troops , inferior material , inferior everything . 
  they were stuck in wwi thinking . 
  best they would have done is take 50 km , consider it a victory , then stop . 
  i know some german commanders said germany would have collapsed had the allies launched a serious offensive , but i do n't give much credit to them . 
  sounds more like taunting to me . 
   but france did n't want to fight , and in being reluctant , germany built up enough forces to crush them . 
  no , the reluctant ones pushing for appeasement were the brits . 
  you know the anecdote about the french and british prime minister returning from munich ? 
  chamberlain gave his triumphant `` peace for our time '' speech , and daladier muttered `` ah , les cons '' ( those fools ! ), 
  to his aide when he saw people praising him for `` saving the peace '' . 
  he said this at munich '' if the western powers capitulate again , they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid . '', 
  because they are correct . 
  it 'd be like pouring money into finding cutting-edge science in the bible . 
  their islam is the true islam . 
  muhammad personnally beheaded children who had never done anything to him . 
  they can use 10 % margarine as car fuel and they wo n't know the difference . 
  not to mention sun screen , toothpaste , make-up , building insulation , fish food , fertilizer , diabetes-reducing cream , industrial lubricant . 
  the possibilities are endless . 
  that 's what they say , but i do n't believe it . 
  they would n't have blitzkrieged enough , their tactics sucked . 
  and poland was n't a threat . 
  as soon as the ost-troops returned , the allies would have been defeated . 
  probably even worse than 1940 , as they would have been overstretched and without fortifications . 
   well , moved forces to poland , sendt ships , soldiers and airplanes . 
  that 's a deterrent . 
  like they would have had any chance . 
  remember dunkerque ? 
  and that was on a territory defended by a much more impressive army than poland 's . 
  and not with a looming red army on the other side . 
  i 'm just going to be the appeasement apologist for a second . 
  hitler would have fought wwii no matter how strong the west responded . 
  his ideology ( militaristic ) , his economy and his goals ( lebensraum ) required war . 
  he was apparently pissed off after munich . 
  the west lost little by giving in to his demands ( with the exception of some honour in not defending their commitment to tchekoslovakia ) and gained time to prepare their armies . 
  i do n't think putin 's ideology and goals require war in the same ineluctable way as hitler 's . 
   but perhaps the world would never have seen ww2 if europe stopped germany from invading poland 1939 . 
  they declared war . 
  what more could they have done ? 
  launch a d-day style attack/liberation on poland at the drop of a hat , surrounded by the might of the 2 strongest armies in the world at the time ? 
  even the 300 in fire is false though . 
  the strasbourg massacre alone accounted for much more than that . 
  you 're not doing any favours to your cause by calling anyone who 's islam-critical a `` neonazi in disguise '' . 
  if you actually know some of them are neo-nazis , please point them out . 
  most of the people on this sub are cosmopolites , as they necessarily speak and use a non-native tongue routinely .
