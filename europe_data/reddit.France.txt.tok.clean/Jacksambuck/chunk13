  easy , cheap or better free , access to basic social services ( education , health ) and social safety net is what would make it a welfare state . 
  interventions to lessen inequalities of opportunity would make it a welfare state . 
  so you prefer your subjective opinion to hard numbers ? 
  those things are very much achieved in western europe , and growing elsewhere . 
  did you miss that the first economy in the world , the flagship of laissez-faire economics , recently socialized healthcare ? 
  fine , if it `` s not working , then you should n't mind slashing everything and getting back to 15 % gdp . 
   collecting and than dispersing with funds through bailouts and more routine dealings with largest companies can make it perhaps a corporatist state , but not a welfare one . 
  do you have anything resembling evidence for these claims ? 
  ie , that a significant portion of state budgets goes to bailouts or `` routine dealings '' over the years ? 
   if syriza is extreme left , what were bolsheviks ? 
  communist parties proper ? 
  you know syriza contains numerous communist parties , right ? 
   any , even so slight attempt to preserve the remnants of welfare state remnants ? 
  the welfare states are bigger than they 've ever been , and still growing . 
  the share of gdp that goes through the state is bigger than ever . 
  it is possible , and so it was in the past , to run a functioning state on 10-15 % of gdp . 
  many countries in western europe are over 50 % . 
  i do n't think it 's cultural , but i do n't like ac either . 
  i do n't mind the rest , although people still seem to be afraid of it . 
  i really like wind in general ( my favourite weather by far ) . 
  sometimes when there 's wind i open all the windows in my house . 
  chemical air is poison , while free range , natural draft is invigorating . 
  i actually agree with you there . 
  this kind of question seems designed to make them look bad , and does n't really mean anything . 
  obviously they think their religion is correct , everyone thinks they are correct . 
  just like most of the questions in this study are designed to make them look good . 
  i included it because it 's the exact opposite of the questions `` is every religion is founded on a true core ? '', 
  and `` should one be open to all religions ? '', 
  in this study : they 're uninformative questions that beg for a yes , so that the pollers can claim tolerance in muslims ( or intolerance in the study i quoted ) . 
  all religions are false and useless , true . 
  but their prophets are just men , and like men , some are good , some are bad . 
  and muhammad is without question a bad man . 
  a mass murderer , a warlord who wiped out entire tribes out of pure greed and bloodlust . 
  he was worse than an overwhelming majority of humans , even in his time . 
  certainly worse than you and me , and worse than jesus . 
   that is the reason why terrorism is so big in third world countries really ? 
  i do n't see indians and chinese kill and terrorize as many people as muslims , yet according to your economical justifications , they should kill more . 
  same for their immigrants . 
  shame that cameron said it yesterday . 
  i 'll reexamine when the evidence is stronger . 
  in a way i empathize with the guy . 
  he tries his hardest to convince himself that his prophet was good so that he does n't have to choose between being a good muslim and being a good person . 
  unfortunately for everyone , his prophet was n't good and muslims need to choose fast . 
   which ~ 35-40 % of muslims in western countries are ok with gay rights/marriage . 
  the guardian article you quoted found a 0 % ( ! ), 
  support for the statement `` homosexual acts are accesptable '' among british muslims . 
  it specifically says the french muslims are the most tolerant on most of these things , including compared to germans , and they clock in at 35 % . 
  this study does n't say 35 , or 40 , but 50-60 % approval ( depending on the relative share of moderate to highly religious muslims ) . 
  60 % is for muslims , 13 % for christians . 
  that one is okay . 
  i 'm not taking the answers at face value , but it 's a valid question . 
   first of all the i think op made a mistake . 
  40 % of religious german muslims support same sex marriage while 60 % of liberal german muslims support same sex marriage yeah , agreed , in the meantime i read the report someone posted , but op 's article definitely said something that was at best confusing :  63 prozent der muslime , die sich als ziemlich oder sehr religi\u00f6s bezeichnen , \u00fcberdenken regelm\u00e4\u00dfig ihre religi\u00f6se einstellung . 
  looks like he 's saying 60 % of `` somewhat religious '' and `` highly religious '' ( together ) approve of gay marriage . 
  whatever it is for that category ( those 2 groups together ) ; 60 % or around 50 % , it 's way too high to be believable . 
   [ 35 % of french muslims ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality ) . 
  your figure does not refer to the same thing . 
  35 % of french muslims think `` homosexual acts are acceptable '' , that 's not gay marriage . 
  and , this is fench muslims as a whole ( including the ones who do n't take religion seriously ) ... and it 's * lower * than the percentage of approval among `` highly religious '' german muslims ( 40 % ) . 
  i 'll quote from this guardian article you gave as a source because far from supporting this study ; it shows the usual disconnect between muslims and the rest of the population . 
   on the issue of sexual relations between unmarried men and women , general populations surveyed express similar views , with the majority believing it was acceptable . 
  but the muslim populations polled again reflected greater diversity on the matter . 
  french muslims ranked highest again , with 48 % believing it was acceptable , followed by 27 % of german muslims responding favourably . 
  british muslims came last , with only 3 % of those questioned personally believing that sex between unmarried men and women was moral . 
  only 27 % of op 's uber-tolerant german muslims think sex outside marriage is acceptable . 
  the us muslim community is far smaller , and the background of us muslims is different than european muslims ( for one thing , the ticket from a muslim country is more expensive ) . 
  we can try something else to reconcile the findings . 
  they support gay marriage because they do n't care what jews and christian do , they live in sin and will go to hell anyway . 
  gay muslims otoh should be stoned the moment they 're out , so the issue of marriage does n't come up . 
  i honestly doubt the figures that are presented ( 40 % of `` highly religious muslims '' support gay marriage ? 
  who knew gays had allies among the mullas !, 
  ) , but i 'm not paying 18 euros to figure out where the worm is . 
  edit : alright , i 'm officially calling bullshit . 
  according to this study , and [ the map ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bbuk9/support_for_samesex_marriage_in_europe/ ) currently on the front page of / r/europe , the support for gay marriage among `` somewhat religious '' and `` highly religious '' german muslims is higher than that of the overall german population . 
  no way that 's correct . 
  those look like soft questions ( really ? 
  they `` have contact '' with nonmuslims ? 
  good to know in a 90 % + nonmuslim country ) , and the results do n't mesh with other studies . 
  how about `` do you want sharia in germany ? 
  `` and `` should apostates from islam be killed ? '', 
  next time . 
   according to 2013 study by social science research center berlin , two thirds of the muslims interviewed say that religious rules are more important to them than the laws of the country in which they live , almost 60 percent of the muslim respondents reject homosexuals as friends ; 45 percent think that jews can not be trusted ; and an equally large group believes that the west is out to destroy islam ( christian respondents ' answers for comparison : as many as 9 percent are openly anti-semitic ; 13 percent do not want to have homosexuals as friends ; and 23 percent think that muslims aim to destroy western culture ) http://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/islamic-fundamentalism-is-widely-spread  according to a 2012 poll , 72 % of the turks in germany believe that islam is the only true religion and 46 % wish that one day more muslims live in germany than christians . 
  they were more important to the attackers . 
   it appears that the gunmen were picking out british and other western targets and letting others go . 
  such a tactic was used by the mumbai attackers in 2008 . 
   a tunisian eye witness told mosaique fm radio :  he was laughing and joking around , like a normal guy . 
  he was choosing who to shoot . 
  some people , he was saying to them , ` you go away ' . 
  he was choosing tourists , british , french . 
  that man obviously did not understand universalism as well as you do . 
  please tell us more about our moral failings . 
   end of story ? 
  26/06/2015 the day a word was slightly misused never forget !, 
  fuck the mods , fuck the french , fuck everything !, 
  this is the last accent that made the vase on the camel 's back overflow into a sea of rage !, 
  are you going to take it ?? 
  best i can do is 5 billion in greek government bonds . 
  what other problems have they decided to answer with `` indifference '' ? 
  any other mass murders we should not know about , for the greater good ? 
  way to make it interesting again .
