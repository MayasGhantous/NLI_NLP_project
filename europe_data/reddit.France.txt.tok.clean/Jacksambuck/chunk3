  you presented one instance , the shock therapy and crumbling economy , as deliberate , then you withdrew it and only offered your conviction that there were other instances . 
   yet you can not deny the interesting silence over the eastern ukrainian civilian casualties in the western media . 
  i 'm not sure it 's interesting . 
  not everything is the result of a conscious , morally suspect choice . 
  maybe the west has more access to the fighting in gaza . 
  maybe hamas is a better communicator than separatist ukrainians . 
  maybe more people care about the palestinians than the ukrainians ( definitely true for arabs everywhere ) . 
   the ratio of civilians killed by the ato and by the rebels is probably 10:1 by now . 
  that has to be false , since mh17 alone already constitues a good 25 % of all civilians killed in the conflict . 
  the rest is murky , but a mistake of that size does n't speak well of the separatists ' competence and value for human life . 
   the western-backed shock therapy was a load of hooey , ussr would have been better off following deng xiapoing 's more methodical , more gradual and less politically liberal set of reforms . 
  it may have been a load of hooey , but i do n't think it was designed to fail by the west . 
  eveyone would have preferred it if russia came out of it like germany or japan after wwii . 
  the opinion that western media is evil and biased is widespread among westerners ( both on the left and right ) , and usually constitutes an unfalsifiable belief ( whenever it talks about some people , others are ignored =  therefore it 's evil and biased ) . 
  i also thought your criticism of ops bias was hypocritical and unnecessary ( as i said elsewhere itt ) . 
  no one 's stopping you from posting pro-russia stuff , and he should n't be stopped either . 
  i do n't think the eu would have a problem with a strong , less nationalistic , democratic russia . 
  but he was defending op 's post , which was attacked by aemilus , who apparently thinks people with a dog in the race should n't post stuff sympathetic to their opinions . 
  so vityok was telling him : downvote , do n't tell op that he should n't `` spam '' interesting articles that happen to agree with him . 
  the thing is , you lost track of which group the evil western media was supposed to ignore this week , and you contradicted yourself blatantly ( `` wait , was it all non-white people ? 
  ca n't say that , since ukrainians are ignored too right now , to the benefit of some other people whose ethnicity escapes me . 
  let 's put down `` slavs '' . 
  black people ? 
  i do n't really care about those right now , since ukrainian deaths are what i as a russian really care about , but i 'll put it in anyway . 
  arabs ? 
  yeah sure arabs , everyone knows they hate arabs . '' ), 
   crickets chirping instead of mentioning all the ukrainian civilians dead , but the mh17 or ** palestinian civilian casualty coverage ** never ends ... -  blacks , ** arabs ** and slavs are n't people . 
  does n't compute . 
  it looks very good / r/abandonedporn, 
  yeah , i meant funding * originating * from gulf states , not the states themselves . 
   al qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken in at least $ 125 million [ $ 93m ] in revenue from kidnappings since 2008 , of which $ 66 million [ $ 49m ] was paid just last year . 
  that 's far less than i expected . 
  does that include tankers off somalia ? 
  are n't al-qaida and isis supposed to be funded to the tune of billions , mostly from gulf states ? 
  that said , i support the basic no-payment policy of the anglo-americans . 
  if you make a habit of paying , the problem snowballs and you end up paying for each hostage indefinitely as his ransom is reused to kidnap others . 
  yeah , but ukraine is not part of the `` core west '' . 
  it 's peripheral at best . 
  if russia had done the same to spain or belgium , then your analogy would hold . 
  the west is like a policeman in this matter , not like a victim . 
  obviously a victim would be far less moderate . 
  the victim , ukraine , is weak , and it 's unclear whether the policeman truly wants or has jurisdiction . 
   china is n't competing against usa . 
  it is competing against places like vietnam . 
  it 's not a zero-sum game . 
  china is n't getting richer because they stole vietnam 's market share or whatever . 
  vietnam has like 7 % average gdp growth in the last 20 years , so they 're fine . 
   china treats their people like absolute shit and they destroy the environment in the process even though there is technology available to avoid those issues . 
  costly technology . 
  how much industry would china have if they got payed like western employees ? 
  as for the environment , they will care about it when they reach a certain wealth level , just like we did . 
   industrial revolution comparisons are asinine because there are centuries of technology that have been developed in the meantime that china has spent zero in r&d to profit from . 
  i do n't really understand what you 're saying here . 
  you want to deny them access to western science and technology because `` we were first '' ? 
  this is n't a dick-swinging contest . 
  people need to stop starving , that 's the only thing that matters . 
   also , you completely avoid the fact that china fakes their currency versus floating it on an open market to cheat on exports and get a leg up on other poor countries . 
  never mind the blatant stealing that china does on a regular basis . 
  they are growing by stealing the technology that other countries spent money and time investing into . 
  i do n't think either of those makes a big difference , or even are morally wrong . 
  manipulating a states ' currency has always been done . 
  and so they steal a little bit from the rich to give to the poor . 
   i ca n't even comprehend how you thought `` global poverty can be solved by slave labor '' was a good sentence to put down into writing . 
  well , it can and is . 
  yesterday 's chinese slave labor 's is today 's `` rising middle class '' . 
   they do n't just throw slave labor at it until profits appear . 
  that 's capitalism though , nothing wrong with that . 
  if only more 3d world countries would throw slave labor at it until profits appear as well as china does , we 'd solve global poverty in a few decades . 
  on the ideological weapon stuff : it 's not because the west is not unilaterally opposed to all dictatorships equally that democracy does n't matter to it . 
  sometimes it can afford to be idealistic , sometimes it ca n't . 
  `` if your cartoonists and journalists were n't such islamophobes , they would n't be receiving death threats '', 
  it really tied the infographic together, 
  yuo speaken le strange languagi, 
  why are you throwing an army of strawmen at me ? 
  they do n't need to be payed sitting on their ass . 
  pay extra people a little bit just to be available , and regular pay for hours served . 
  or you can pay volunteers that little bit , thereby making sure there are enough , depending on where you are . 
  the cost of this is minimal , when compared with an entire year out of every citizen 's life . 
  and again , the potential selfishness of your pov bothers me : `` let 's just have some other people work for our collective good '' . 
  or maybe you 're concerned you may have wasted a year , and want other people to suffer too , else `` it 's not fair ! '' . 
   what kind of world do you live in , where your neighbour 's house burns down and you say `` naaah , i 'm not going to help , you did n't pay me '' ? 
  that 's right , i 'm a psycho who just wants to see the world burn . 
  who said anything about forbidding people to volunteer ? 
  take the volunteers , and pay people to supplement when needed . 
  what kind of world do you live in , that when you need a job done , you just force people to do it ? 
  money , dear boy, 
  do n't give me that life lesson crap . 
  if you do n't want a low-level job , like cook or mechanic or paramedic , you 're screwed out of a year of your life . 
  do n't piss on young people and tell them it gives them a chance to grow by overcoming adversity . 
  most people i know who did zivi spend their time doing beds in hospitals or walk along some state employee for shit pay for a year . 
  you 're trying to pass it off as some year-long first-aid course , and i 'm not buying it . 
   the purpose is to build up a reserve a reserve of what ? 
  people who know how to do low-level jobs ? 
  we have that already . 
   you 're slippery-sloping the whole thing ad absurdum . 
  no , it was just a comment on your weak justification - `` it 's a duty , therefore you should do it '' . 
   does that also apply to school ? 
  no , of course not . 
  it 's the opposite of school . 
  the state invests in the education of its citizens .
