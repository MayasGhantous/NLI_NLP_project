  otoh , conscription/civil service is an extremely heavy poll tax on the young ( worth like , 5-10k euros or so ) . 
  it 's also very inefficient . 
  most young people can produce more long-term cash for the state by doing a regular job/going to college . 
   i can also get drafted to serve as an election official or lay judge . 
  that 's not a year of your life , is it ? 
   these are things one just does because having duties is a thing if you live in a society . 
  why not make it ten or fifteen years , like the romans ? 
  no problem , * one just does it * , because it 's a duty , and that 's all the justification anyone living in society needs . 
  i 'm talking about the preference of most people * not to work as the state 's slave for a year * , dude . 
  tough shit to have to deal with people 's preferences . 
  i always thought it extremely unfair that 98 % of those who are allowed to vote on this issue will never be affected by it ( since they 're too old ) . 
  i say we force 60-year-olds to do the firefighting year to solve that injustice . 
  norway : doing the right thing in the face of overwhelming support, 
  indeed . 
  it was an insensitive joke . 
  there 's really nothing funny about children dying . 
  well , enemy five year olds . 
  those dutch children were ** innocent ** . 
  good ole monroe doctrine, 
  either learn engineering or die , little one . 
   it 's even possible for economic growth and being more invironmentally friendly , to the point where humans leave no negative footprint on the earth because of technology . 
  however , i do recognize that as a far future type thing no , that 's actually the normal thing . 
  it 's been happening since a good century in developed countries . 
  see : air and river pollution . 
  there 's always a phase where growth equals pollution ( industrialization in 19th century europe , china in the last decades ) , followed by one where growth equals less pollution , as people can afford to care about the environment . 
  co2 pollution is sort of an exception to the rule , because of its delayed and uncertain effects ( people care less than the clear danger of toxic smog , for instance ) . 
  however , productivity per co2 pollution has increased . 
  james bond is back in business after years of reading emails sitting on his ass !, 
  this is * within * ( developed ) countries , though . 
  from the context of your comment i thought you were referring to international differences . 
  any evaluation of global inequality that misses the fact that large numbers of chinese , indians , etc have made great economical gains in the last decades , is missing the big picture imo . 
  the world gini coefficient went from .67 to .61 in the last 40 years : http://www.voxeu.org/article/parametric-estimations-world-distribution-income, 
   assuming world income disparity continues to increase as it has the last decades what does that mean ? 
  source pls . 
  that 's what gw is for they win when we lose at waterloo napoleon did surrender, 
  democracy 's main advantage is not that its governance is better than competing systems ( although it is , to a degree ) , but that it prevents civil war . 
  systems that disenfranchise some groups leaves them with no other alternative than fighting the system to be heard . 
  the original guy 's argument was that since they cut their price by a third and the price is arbitrary , it was n't capitalism . 
  this argument is flawed , because it assumes a relation between production costs and selling price , which is n't there in that case because there 's not enough gas in europe and moving it from elsewhere costs too much money . 
  do you really think russia is selling gas at a loss ( in general ) ? 
  what do you mean by `` actor '' ? 
  the gas has to come from somewhere . 
  there * are no * cheaper alternatives . 
  the free market ca n't just magically create gas !, 
  he 's not jesus !, 
  it * is * capitalism . 
  we pay the lowest price possible . 
  it just so happens the lowest price is determined by russia . 
  what are our alternatives ? 
  importing gas per boat . 
  this costs more than russian gas . 
  ofc , the russians pay only a fraction of what we pay to get the gas out of the ground , so they could afford to lower their price if other sources became cheaper , but i do n't see how that violates capitalism . 
  m denied ever sending an agent there . 
  the man is on his own to escape and pacify the middle east once again . 
  i 'm happy because i win . 
  i win because i 'm happy . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  very helpful . 
  i 'm trying to quit smoking , i can just move to bologna and save up on the patches , which is good for the environment .

  like 90 % of reddit activity , including your pointless criticisms . 
   what are you going to do when a subreddit turns private because it only allows , say , conservatives in ? 
  i 'll call it a `` lack of free speech '' , as i just said . 
  then i 'll make a sub with less shitty rules , if i had any interest in that particular community in the first place . 
  that 's the point of reddit . 
   what is your alternative , then ? 
  should we get rid of the downvoting system as well ? 
  because hey , hiding comments that get too many downvotes is against free speech , right ? 
  clicking on a comment is no big deal , so free speech is only limited by downvotes in a minimal way . 
   this forum that is ( again ) privately owned , and therefore under no legal obligations as to free speech . 
  ** no one ** is talking about legal obligations , except the people who play that card , and that 's why it 's such a lame defense . 
  do n't pretend like banning people for low-level flaming is not against that principle . 
  and especially do n't play the tired `` free speech is just not being put in prison for your opinions '' card . 
  free speech does yes cover such things . 
  it 's not a law , it 's a principle . 
  where there 's speech , there 's free speech , or the lack of it . 
  i like the part where they pretend to help the community when they ban people they do n't like . 
  nono , that 's just the youths of our prized muslim community celebrating diversity . 
  the french way is claiming to strike while staying at home . 
  i did n't see des excuses in there . 
  do n't tell us how to live our lives !, 
  worth its weight in cut coke . 
  upboat because god 's work came here to say this , sir bro . 
   you get punished for doing what you 're told and rewarded for not , bizarre . 
  that 's the whole principle of a bailout , really . 
  germany did n't lie to the eu , played by the rules , did n't fuck up their budget , yet it 's all `` pay this '' , `` guarantee that '' , and `` thanks a lot , hitler '' . 
  you can , it just sells for the price of printer ink . 
  it would n't be anything new . 
  it 's a very auld alliance . 
  the rate of unemployment is falling , so either your numbers are false ( do n't read spanish ) or , the number of people employed is increasing more than that . 
  all the jealous potheads are going : ' i want to vomit in public too !, 
  but the commenter seems to be aware of that , so the evidence must have looked strong . 
  press tv could theoretically have access to credible debunking evidence , since syria and iran are allies . 
  how to build a fire and make bronze weapons . 
  what 's the problem with lybia ? 
  gaddafi 's gone , mission accomplished , as they say . 
  what do you mean `` pathetic record '' , what are the usa 's successes ? 
  i like that a lot . 
  you are a fair man , jan. . must be why they burned you .
