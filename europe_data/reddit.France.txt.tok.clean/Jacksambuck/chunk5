  i 'm not sure that 's true . 
  i mean yeah , they exist . 
  but they 're not anywhere near as numerous as we 'd like . 
  the arab spring failed spectacularly because we overestimated them . 
  there are n't masses of westernized people like us , yearning for freedom and liberal democracy . 
  for the most part , the people there want , or at least are highly susceptible to , a good old sharia-based muslim brotherhood/iran type theocracy . 
  in syria and egypt , the westernized groups you speak of are for all intents and purposes allied to the more or less secular dictators . 
  why ? 
  obviously because they 're too small to go on their own , unlike the religious fraction . 
  so they pick the lesser evil , as we should have . 
  you splitters were given every chance . 
  who could forget how you refused a generous offer to come back to the one and only church in the year of our lord 1203 ? 
  we 're still pissed about that . 
  because women . 
  women are never to be held responsible for their actions , never to be harmed no matter their crime . 
  they 're seen like children . 
  will someone please think of the murderous women ? 
  their male counterparts can die and no one bats an eye , except maybe to applaud , but god forbid a poor little woman is hurt in any way by the whole djihad-joining thing . 
  you can always click on the name of whoever is involved in the post-deletion discussion ( usually the same people ) to read their deleted comment from their name page . 
  i am not endorsing rape as punishment , or involved in any way in the rapes . 
  i am simply washing my hands of their fates in light of their catastrophic failings as moral beings . 
  i am not obliged to protect bad guys from bad guys . 
  ever heard the phrase `` the good are friends to one another '' - well , this is the other side of that coin . 
  i am a friend to their victims , not to them . 
  one problem is not like the other . 
  one has moral urgency , the other does n't . 
  at best . 
  at worst , helping the would-be murderers actually has negative moral value ; ie , it makes the world worse by helping the people who are creating more innocent victims . 
  before we spend a single unit of resources or compassion onto would-be murderers , we should spent 1,000 times that on the non-murderers who just want to live in peace . 
  anything else would be a moral failing . 
  you think you have the moral high ground because you do n't discriminate between evil and good , murderers and victims ? 
  what kind of person are you ? 
  they 're really cool about it . 
  i would be freaking out . 
  this event will define their lives . 
  i 'd call my agent : `` call oprah , call letterman , call nike 's marketing division , audition ghost writers and screenwriters for my tell-all book and movie . 
  charter a concorde for the flight home , start lobbying for the nobel peace prize . 
  i want a ferrari , a commission as colonel in the french special forces , a lifetime eurail pass , a date with carla bruni , an autograph from the queen . '', 
   they think not doing something because it will make assholes turn to literal fascism and the far right is n't a very good idea . 
  but that * is * stupid . 
  let 's be very generous and assume immigrants are never a problem in themselves , they 're all flowers and puppies and good things , but they turn native people into nazis . 
  why would you create this conflict ? 
  why endanger the migrants by planting them in a society that hates and oppresses them ? 
  --  nobody can quite decide whether migrants are a problem because they work so hard that they 're taking all the jobs ( the biggest fear of a working class pummelled by unemployment and falling wages ) or because they 're too lazy to work so they 're taking all the benefit money ( the biggest fear of a middle class suffering with rising rents and cuts to social services ) ;  it can not be both at once , and in fact it is n't -- but it 's important that the paradox is maintained nonetheless . 
  why ca n't it be both ? 
  more third-world migrants means there are both more people on welfare and more people competing for shit jobs . 
  germans had a choice . 
  it was n't inevitable that hitler came to power , and it sure was n't a simple cause and effect process that made `` heavy reparations '' into `` fight the world , kill all the jews '' . 
  mods : `` let a hundred flowers bloom '' it 's a trap , abort thread !, 
  i like to think of it as a horizontal louis xvi in blue stockings . 
  we ate bones ? 
   and an ally provides you with help etc. , ... not ask you to surrender ( ? ), 
  your ships yo them . 
  wtf ? 
  aye , and the ally they were providing help to was germany . 
  france was the most `` productive '' of the nazi vassal states - ie , they sent plenty of industrial equipment , locomotives , etc , their way . 
  a state that does this , again , is de facto not an ally of britain . 
  the french helped the german war effort . 
  mostly unwillingly , no doubt . 
  but still , from a purely utilitarian perspective ( not considering guilt or justice ) , they were german assets , ie , british killer helpers . 
   consider that the british had knowledge that admiral darlan had given orders oh great , he 'd given orders ... 
  since he controls the universe , that means the fleet could n't have possibly been lost to the germans . 
  verbal assurances mean nothing in a context of total war , especially not coming from a collaborationist second-rate politician . 
  a man can change his mind , or the matter can be outside of his hands entirely . 
  the french fleet should have been given to britain immediately , period . 
  they could n't take the slightest risk of it falling in german hands . 
  the sailors were no longer allies of britain , they were subjects of a collaborating state . 
  even if vichy had kept it , they probably would have used it to re-take or defend against the free french . 
  bottom line , they were closer to enemies than allies . 
  i 'm amazed at how well we did diplomatically after wwii given how we got our asses kicked , then just waited for the cavalry . 
  but we got a nice chair on the un and even our own occupation zone , just for showing up at the end on a borrowed jeep . 
  what would we have gotten if we 'd won , lol . 
  theoretically i guess we were allies and part of the victors , yet often in history the theoretical matters less than than the actual . 
  and actually , in the end , we did little , and were weak . 
  they could have walked all over us and treat us like a second-rate power , realpolitik - style . 
  i suspect the us and brits needed one more strong ally to counterbalance the reds ... not that i 'm ungrateful for that . 
  no you do n't understand , in * love , actually * they show the us pres is a mean bully ( * analogy * ) who wants to sexually harass the british prime minister 's gf ( * analogy * ) and he just needs to tell him to fuck off on all levels to reclaim the lost honour of the proud british people , in fiction ... god that was pathetic . 
  i play the canada joker card : bilinguism . 
  whoever speaks both languages best wins canada 's spoils . 
  write an essay in french as devil 's advocate , justifying the existence of the `` english breakfast '' . 
  we 'll take canada as honorary france-uk tie for first place , thanks . 
  * \u266b they 're not even a real country anyway \u266a *, 
  she 's progressive alright , it 's just that progressives do n't give two shits about what men want . 
  `` better to burn ten thousand men than inconvenience one woman '' is the progressive motto . 
  it is true though . 
  the minister of justice admitted as much . 
  --  handmade traduction : * the law is meant to stop people who would act only out of curiosity , without taking into account the well-being of the child or the family when it comes to the knowledge of this biological bond . 
  * http://expertadn.fr/le-gouvernement-francais-isole-sur-la-legalite-des-tests-adn-de-paternite/, 
   to contest paternity in a legal context you have to go trough a judge anyway unless in others countries you just have to go to the town hall with your sheet of paper and say `` not my son , bye '' but i doubt it . 
  it 's not just about contesting legal stuff . 
  inquiring minds want to know the truth for its own sake . 
  and that is currently forbidden , why ? 
   and 10 married out of 1000 couples divorced in 2013 [ 1 ] according to the insee when in the us it 's 3,4 [ 2 ] . 
  talk about `` keeping families together '' ... those are not comparable numbers ... one is 3.4 / ** 1000 total population ** the other is 10 out of ** 1000 couples ** . 
  you have to go through a judge ... why are n't private persons allowed to do it , like elsewhere ? 
  i think the rationale is something like `` keeping families together '' , as he said . 
  i appreciated this post . 
  but this is not correct :  maybe i should because the recent influx of kill-the-euro down with the eu , immigrants-are-invadng-us folks are probably really too dumb to understand sarcasm . 
  actually , the most strident anti-euro krugman fanboys are usually left and far left , therefore pro-immigration . 
  while i for instance am neither a fan of krugman or muslim immigration and posted [ a similar comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dm0au/germany_not_greece_should_exit_the_euro/ct6hj06 ) to yours .
