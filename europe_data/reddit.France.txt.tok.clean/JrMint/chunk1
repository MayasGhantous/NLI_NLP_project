which is not that uncommon . 
  in french , '' [ eau-de-vie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eau_de_vie ) '' ( `` water of life '' ) also refers to alcohol . 
  and their own runway . 
  and their own terminal . 
  their own city , in fact , without all those pesky norwegians : `` ioc proposes the closure of schools and the ** local people are encouraged to take vacations ** . '', 
  who the fuck do these douchebags think they are ? 
  in theory and only in the immediate perhaps ( until scotland becomes part of the eu , anyway ) , but in reality i think you 're underestimating the attachment of people who immigrate ( `` eu immigrant '' ! = `` merely transitory '' ) . 
  just because they * could * move back to their country of origin does n't mean they want to . 
  who is `` them '' ? 
  eu citizens who have chosen to move to scotland and make it their home ? 
  people who work there ? 
  people who have had children there ? 
  if they live there , it affects their lives and they 're concerned . 
  period . 
  if they live there , it 's anything but irrelevant . 
   but questions of sovereignty largely tend to stem from thoughts of ** national identity ** , and strong feelings that their ** ancestral cultural exception ** should be recognized through absolute sovereignty . 
   both of these concepts are open to debate , and in scotland they have been changing greatly over the past two decades . 
  scottish national identity has been moving from anchored around `` born and bred '' scots ( `` ancestral cultural exception '' , in your words ) to a more american-like melting pot multicultural identity for a while . 
  there are regular surveys of the population that show public opinion on scottishness is moving toward inclusion based on shared values rather than shared blood . 
  projects on the issue include * who 's a real scot ? 
  embracing multicultural scotland * , the * one scotland , many cultures * campaign , the * fresh talent initiative * , and others . 
  this has influenced ( and been influenced by ) the snp and the cultivation of civic nationalism as opposed to ethnic nationalism . 
  scottish vs. british identity has obviously shown up in the debate on the referendum . 
  to dismiss immigrants as `` naturally less concerned about their adoptive country 's identity '' is to fundamentally misunderstand the national identity that has been cultivated in scotland in the past two decades . 
  the sep has in fact been promoting immigration to scotland in part to deal with their aging population and to promote diversity and innovation . 
  the fresh talent campaign was at the heart of this . 
  the sep report was `` new scots : attracting fresh talent to meet the challenge of growth '' and the vision of the immigrants intended to integrate them into the scottish national identity , promoting a scottish identity based on civic identity -- residence -- rather than ethnicity . 
  `` we will strive to make scotland a tolerant , open and diverse country , one where all scots , ** regardless of their background or origin ** , feel at home . '' - [ sep ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2004/02/18984/33673 ) tl ; dr : scottish elites have been promoting ( successfully ) civic nationalism over ethnic nationalism . 
  to exclude immigrants from the vote , who are arguably as concerned by the vote as anyone else , would be contrary to the public sentiment of what it means to be scottish . 
  also the starting point for the paris marathon , which is cool if you 're into that sort of thing . 
  it 's padded with the fiber connections of marseille and paris . 
  even in big cities , adsl can be crap here because of a lack of nodes . 
  i 'm 3.5 km from mine and get 6 mbit maximum , and yet there is a fiber node less than 500m away . 
  of course they did n't think to run fiber optic cables to the buildings surrounding the node , though . 
  i completely agree . 
  in france , it feels like so many stores are stuck in the 20th century . 
  some have a facebook page , even fewer have photos of their products on there . 
  and yet even when they have websites or facebook pages , i ca n't count the number of times i 've shown up at a store to find a `` fermeture exceptionnelle '' sign ( exceptionally closed ) on the door . 
  put it on your fucking website !, 
  if it 's such an afterthought for them , visiting their store becomes a afterthought for me . 
  i do n't shop with amazon because the new book prices are cheaper with free shipping . 
  i shop with them because they have used books available ( so i 'm not against paying shipping ) . 
  i buy with them because their prices on other objects are cheaper than elsewhere ( like a pair of headphones recently purchased ) and the customer service is the best around . 
  if i have any problem , i know amazon will help me . 
  i do n't want to spend time going around stores to find something . 
  i just want to buy it online , have it sent to me . 
  brick and mortar stores are for grocery shopping at this point for me . 
  in the end , what has actually happened is that amazon has raised the prices on new books and set shipping at 1 cent . 
  so in the end this law , in an attempt to support brick and mortar bookshops against the big bad american company that pays no taxes in france ( a nice scapegoat for the french who could start by looking at their home grown kingpins like martin bouygues whose accounts are all offshore ) will only end up making amazon more money and making it even harder for french bookstores . 
  brilliant plan . 
  you 're right , it is indeed a european sentiment and certainly not unique to france . 
  as for polls , i looked some up . 
  51 % say belonging to the eu is a good thing , 38 % against . 
  [ this study ] ( http://www.csa.eu/multimedia/data/sondages/data2014/opi20140508-les-francais-et-l-union-europeenne.pdf ) ( pdf ) where that statistic comes from also shows how the anti-europe sentiment has increased in tandem with the economic crisis , giving the euro-skeptics a scapegoat for people 's problems . 
  another poll from this week says that 64 % of business owners say the eu is `` very important '' to them but 75 % of them can not name what those `` very important '' institutions are , and what influence they have in their lives ( [ article ( fr ) ] ( http://www.metronews.fr/info/elections-europeennes-2014-sondage-7-patrons-sur-10-ne-comprennent-rien-a-l-action-de-l-ue/mnew!dzfacsrgyi7e/ ) ) . 
  essentially , the euro is great , the open markets are great , but what can a euro deputy do for me ? 
  [ one more ] ( http://www.ifop.com/media/poll/1978-1-study_file.pdf ) : what community do you feel most attached to : your city , region , national government , europe ? 
  respondents could choose two answers . 
  7 % chose europe first , 16 % made europe one of their choices . 
  small sample size ( 100 ) but another statistic . 
  electoral districts are useful because the country itself is not homogenous ( and the issue of not having a pirate party rep is just because it 's a small party ) and would in theory give a voice to smaller parties such as the pirate party or a brittany party , etc. 
  but turnout ? 
  no , probably not . 
  there would be fewer people to pay attention to , but that 's not the main reason behind low turnout in my mind . 
  the european elections and the eu are just not considered to be important to the lives of french people . 
  the fact that we 're discussing this at all means we have followed the elections or are concerned in some way . 
  many average people just are not concerned in france , even those who always vote for their local and the presidential elections . 
  the high abstention reflects this , but also reflects a lack of feeling like the candidates represent one 's views . 
  if 80 % of french voters had voted and the election results were the same for the fn , they would have a legitimate victory . 
  but they could never obtain such a victory . 
  instead , they win with 10 % of french voters and say `` this proves how much french people have rejected europe and have re-embraced france '' ( paraphrase of what a fn candidate who won just said on french tv ) . 
  right ... all ~ 10 % of french people . 
  in the west there was no pirate party representative , with whom my views most coincide . 
  furthermore , we only got the elections information on friday ( in nantes at least ) . 
  who are the candidates ? 
  almost all of them are fringe parties . 
  obviously european elections are not taken seriously here . 
  it 's not really surprising the entire country except the west went for the front national since they 're so motivated . 
  most people do n't see the use of european elections or how the decisions made at that level affect their lives . 
  edit : down voters can go fuck themselves . 
  california is the world 's 12th largest economy , texas 15th , new york 17th . 
  i had no idea la trappe was in holland ( figured belgium ) . 
  their isid ` or is delicious . 
  they 're not official languages of the country , but they are more and more recognized as part of france 's cultural heritage . 
  every time i go to breizh i see breton on road signs . 
  for sure . 
  it used to be that buying a baguette would give you bread that lasted a few days . 
  now the following day the baguette is almost rock solid and not enjoyable to eat . 
  on the rare occasion that i buy a baguette , it 's at most just a half . 
  otherwise too much is wasted . 
   believe it or not the russians are peaceful people since ww2 . 
  just check any of the big cold war hot spots , korea , vietnam , the 1962 cuban missile crisis . 
  not one russian soldier was ever deployed there . 
  except for hungary in 1956 , czechoslovakia in 1968 , afghanistan in 1979 , the threat of similar attacks to keep other eastern european countries in line , and recent attacks on georgia and chechnya . 
  i 'm not saying there is a legitimate fear of russia in the eu today , but russia has not been the dalai lama of states since 1945 , no more than the us has . 
  this is simply a comment on the level of english of french individuals in eu government . 
  the list is comprised mainly of false friends ( `` actual '' vs. `` actuel '' , etc ) which are extremely common and should n't be hard to master . 
  some of it , however , is nitpicking on the part of these british translators . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with gps , the american equivalent of `` satnav '' . 
  they should n't either since they admit `` cellphone '' to be acceptable .
