  interpreters should n't need to be called in for every board meeting in companies or in governments , but it behooves us to use as clear and concise a diction as possible in documents that are essentially for the citizens of the governed area . 
  i feel exactly the same way about the inverse : recently french industrial recovery minister arnaud montebourg was warned about needlessly using english in his official government documents . 
  he used `` silver economy '' to describe an aging labor population of seniors ( `` silver '' referring to their hair ) . 
  he justified it saying that they wanted to use the language that seemed to be the most apt for the situation , as if it were a long-established term in english like `` chic '' or `` business '' . 
  i 've never heard this term in english and had no idea what it meant before he attempted to explain it in french . 
  `` economie argent\u00e9e '' would 've been equally unintelligible . 
  it may be a cute term , but the proper term in french and english would be greying economy , or \u00e9conomie grisonnante . 
  but the english formulation certainly is n't common enough to justify using it in french-state documents to the detriment of the citizens who might desire to read it . 
  anyway , back to the original point . 
  frankly , if this situation were reversed , and we were talking about `` les erreurs les plus communes en fran\u00e7ais faites dans les documents officiels du gouvernement '' , there would be a huge outcry from the french and pointless debates of stylistic minutiae on how foreigners get french so wrong . 
  i do nevertheless think that the last point made in the article has some merit : having french teachers teach in english to french students is merely going to perpetuate poor english habits if it does not coincide with more focus on correct english communication through native or university-level professors . 
  that is not to say that the recently voted french law permitting more non-language classes being taught in english is bad . 
  it 's a step in the right direction . 
  it should also legalize the already common practice of inviting foreign teachers whose native language might not even be english though for want of a sufficient level in french must teach in english . 
  there has been much talk of appeasement of lazy unilingual anglophones , which i think is completely beside the point . 
  if an anglophone comes to school in france , it 's at least in part if not in whole to learn french . 
  however , they are ignoring other countries whose english may be better than their french , such as china or india . 
  partnerships and exchange programs with chinese universities are expanded every year , and often their french is quite poor , especially when confronted with subjects like engineering . 
  having a few more classes available in english in french universities will certainly help facilitate the arrival of students whose level in french is insufficient to follow such classes . 
  to be honest , france , si fi\u00e8re \u00e0 juste titre de notre belle langue , has made a mountain out of a molehill here . 
  what are you imagining a vowel sound is ? 
  there may only be 5 so-called vowel letters in english , but over 15 vowel sounds at least . 
  check pms . 
  france has recently had a new show debut and it 's been widely talked about . 
  [ les revenants ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2521668/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) . 
  8 episodes . 
  in a small french town in the mountains , people start coming back to life from previous accidents . 
  they 're not traditional zombies . 
  they 're as they once were and do n't remember what happened to them . 
  their families , who have moved on , have to adjust to their coming back . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  i 'm on the 3rd episode right now . 
  you go girl . 
  * i approve of your life choices and wish you well . 
  thanks , i was wondering myself if i could read it in french . 
  getting eu citizenship takes many years of legal living and working , and even then it 's not guaranteed . 
  have not heard a word in france in weeks . 
  whatever keeps those ad impressions and clicks up , though . 
  the woman claimed to live in toulouse , not paris . 
  and frankly , if she got spit on literally every day , i suspect there 'd be a police report documenting at least one such incident . 
  i 'd love to see one . 
   the two tax rulings issued by ireland concerned the internal allocation of these profits within apple sales international ( rather than the wider set-up of apple 's sales operations in europe ) . 
  specifically , they endorsed a split of the profits for tax purposes in ireland : under the agreed method , ** most profits were internally allocated away from ireland to a `` head office '' ** within apple sales international . 
  this `` head office '' was not based in any country and ** did not have any employees or own premises ** . 
  its activities consisted solely occasional board meetings . 
  only a fraction of the profits of apple sales international were allocated to its irish branch and subject to tax in ireland . 
  the remaining vast majority of profits were allocated to the `` head office '' , where they remained untaxed . 
   therefore , only a small percentage of apple sales international 's profits were taxed in ireland , and the rest was taxed nowhere . 
  in 2011 , for example ( according to figures released at us senate public hearings ) , apple sales international recorded profits of us$ 22 billion ( c.a. 
  $ 16 billion [ 1 ] ) but under the terms of the tax ruling only around $ 50 million were considered taxable in ireland , leaving $ 15.95 billion of profits untaxed . 
  as a result , apple sales international paid less than $ 10 million of corporate tax in ireland in 2011 -- ** an effective tax rate of about 0.05 % on its overall annual profits ** . 
  in subsequent years , apple sales international 's recorded profits continued to increase but the profits considered taxable in ireland under the terms of the tax ruling did not . 
  thus ** this effective tax rate decreased further to only 0.005 % ** in 2014 . 
  [ from the press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-2923_en.htm ) less than 1 % tax rate ? 
  yes please , said all small and medium-sized businesses in europe . 
  i do n't know why migrants have n't tried crossing the channel by small boat already if they crossed the mediterranean . 
  the french northern coastline is long .

  yes they will . 
  it 's a known problem in french prisons , radicalization that is . 
  where are the no-go zones ?

  hamon and macron as well considering how socialist party members are pissed valls did n't win the primary . 
  i thought it was melania trump . 
  for what it 's worth , a poll of voters on french tv an hour ago said that 1 in 4 were voting primarily to kick a candidate off the ticket , while the rest were voting for ideas and a program . 
  \\* has installed , for years . 
  his humanity was lost long before today . 
  8pm local paris time . 
  so much of the country is so fed up with fillon and his scandal that many might just not vote , or cast a blank ballot . 
  on the other hand , le pen 's voters are very enthusiastic and motivated . 
  strategic ? 
  for all the french people getting their news on france from the nyt and who did n't already know this ? 
  must be a huge electorate , that . 
  france2 had a documentary or two on these two and others in the fn a few weeks back . 
  i guess nyt just got around to watching them . 
  from what i 've read , it 's more complicated than `` it 's day 366 of owning my apple product and i 've got this problem now . '', 
  if you have a problem in the first year , apple will handle it without applecare . 
  but , and i may be wrong and would be happy to be corrected , the 2-year warranty law in the eu supposedly states that in the second year you must show proof that the problem was there from the first day you bought it in order to get it fixed after that first year . 
  so , it 's 1-year limited warranty with an additional 1-year known , documented , manufacturer 's defects-only warranty ; basically , it 's not a true 2-year warranty , at least in my opinion . 
  yes it has n't been widely reported , although a quick googling brings up articles on le figaro and lib\u00e9 . 
  still , it 's not that important . 
  attendance at church is pretty low and those who go probably are against homosexual marriage anyway . 
  how is it crap ? 
  read any french newspaper and see studies done on the latter , while most any french person will affirm the former . 
  right you are . 
  if there 's one thing the french do well , it 's complain . 
  and one thing they do n't do well is speak foreign languages . 
  doubt they 'll be a mass exodus . 
  it 's not 75 % of your income , ffs . 
  everything up to a million will be taxed as it is now . 
  income after that million would be taxed at the new 75 % rate . 
  nyc 's subway cars have air conditioning from my experience . 
  on the platform , though , it 's hot as hell ( again , my limited experience ) . 
  and she 's an \u00e9narque ( a graduate of france 's most prestigious elite school ) . 
  how can she not know what net neutrality is ?!, 
  playing `` america is the boogeyman '' is a tired old game in french politics , and i did n't expect it from someone with her background and supposed intelligence . 
  i filled out the questionnaire .
