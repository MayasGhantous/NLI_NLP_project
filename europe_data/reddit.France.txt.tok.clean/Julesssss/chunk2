  some french isp 's have started doing it since last week as well http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57605443-94/french-isp-free-upgrades-fiber-customers-to-gigabit-broadband/ it 's about 30-35 $ a month . 
  make it istanbul then . 
  you 'll see something truly different than the two previous ones . 
  no paris ? 
  appart from the friendly people ( and that 's arguable ) , it 's exactly what you are looking for . 
  appart from that , i 'd say roma is awesome . 
  amsterdam too , in a totally different way . 
  yes . 
  everybody gets confused with this name . 
  you got ta be kidding . 
  i thought it was because of the idiots on twitter , but nope , turns out cia agents are also stupid . 
  ( plus , they are on tv ), 
  it 's exactly the same in france at least . 
  including the price ( in paris ), 
  i was talking only about the hero/military accomplishment thing . 
  about napoleon beeing short : https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1uifwr/til_napolean_wasnt_actually_short_he_was_actually/ but yes , holland looks ridiculous in that pic, 
  i may be wrong , but i think it might have to do with the fact that we do n't have that culture of `` heroes '' here in france like you guys do in the us . 
  you 'd never see someone wearing a cap `` war veteran '' or something like that here , we do n't `` brag '' ( maybe not the best word ) about this kind of things . 
  so to me it seems pretty normal that we do n't even know who it is , just because it 's not really part of our culture to be proud of that kind of accomplishments . 
  because he uses a language that not everybody understands first , and because it makes it annoying to read, 
  how fucking shameful this is for us . 
  also the [ marathon des sables ( marathon of the sands ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marathon_des_sables ) , 251k in the sahara desert . 
  and indiegogo is n't even a european company ... 
  yes you do and it fucking drives us crazy, 
  you should come to paris and see how your fellow americans behave then . 
  dick thing to do anywhere in the world if i recall correctly . 
  i 've been to ooty . 
  it is indeed a cool place , but it 's also swarmed by tourist , dirty and full of scammers / people trying to rip you off . 
  [ full report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6729998/3-05032015-ap-en.pdf/f064bb11-e239-4a8c-a40b-72cf34f1ac6f ), 
  can you recommend any cool treks ? 
  i 've never been to romania and this is something that may makes me want to visit, 
  depends if it 's based on sales , or on some kind of panel where they ask people who many packs they smoke in a day . 
  either way , it 's skewed . 
  this is the exact picture and exemple that is beeing used in the video, 
  happy to see that france is only 62nd on that list , contrary to popular belief, 
  interesting !, 
  it is n't the first time you notice this ? 
  do n't worry we 'll be at the top of our game against you wednesday, 
  i must confess , i have no idea about it . 
  what links do we have ? 
  probably quite cheap . 
  there 's nothing there . 
  now i do n't like you either :(, 
  that 's not called being proud , that 's called being an idiot . 
  i hear henry will be the one building it, 
  has spotify been sold ? 
  i thought they were still independent, 
  trump , dutertre , putin , theresa may , netanyahou , erdogan ... crooked politicians in south america , dicktators ( yes , i did that on purpose ) in a lot of african countries . 
  i wonder which country is your exemple . 
  aka being a dick, 
  yes , because we 've had had already several attacks and the chrismas period was considered very high risk . 
  strasbourg hosts the biggest christmas market of france so there 's that as well, 
   if i 'm honest it 's way more noticeable in france when i visited and there were troops running around in full gear everywhere . 
  berlin where there was a terrorist attack a couple of weeks ago i genuinely would n't have even known an attack happened without the news and that there 's a couple more police discreetly around tourist areas . 
  iirc , it was the same after the first attacks in france . 
  it only started to change after those attacks became recurring, 
  it 's a joke , look at the top comment, 
  the nice thing about a bar graph is that it 's sorted , so you can quickly identify which countries are on top/bottom . 
  with a map , you can identify a value faster for a given country ( do n't have to look for it in a list ) i guess it depends what one is looking for . 
  thanks anyways !, 
  would this be more readable on a map ? 
  just wondering if it 's worth doing for that kind of data . 
  i sure hope france will be higher on that list soon, 
  check out mapfrappe.com , you can compare the size like this : http://mapfrappe.com/?show=48769, 
  yes, 
  right , not that many coconut trees in direct contact with the ocean, 
  mosquitos for exemple, 
  apparently coconuts falling from trees kill more people than sharks, 
  looks like they are different fluids , with different density . 
  but that 's not how it works either ... 
  i think ? 
  do we ? 
  i know `` fumer comme un pompier '' but i do n't think i 've ever heard fumer comme un turc, 
  it 's already re-opened http://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75019/paris-la-baignade-de-la-villette-rouvre-ses-bassins-25-07-2017-7155561.php , it was because of the heavy rains of this weekend, 
  can definetly relate to that . 
  i did a trip around the world for 2 years a little while ago and it 's the same thing . 
  a dot in quebec . 
  another one in guadalajara . 
  another one in el calafate . 
  etc. . . 
  you 're just giving a bad rep to kraftwerk , sadly , people who do n't know them are never going to listen to it after reading such a pathetic comment, 
  he 's thinking `` man this is my jam . . shit i 'm the president now , ca n't show it too much '', 
  it 's in stavanger ( south of norway ) , if anybody 's wondering . 
  you can hike to the [ preikestolen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/preikestolen ) not far from that city . 
  sorry i messed up the name , my love for ska music is playing tricks on me , 
  in france we have the zubrowska vodka , it 's quite known here . 
  your post made me understand the name . 
  did you read the article ? 
  everybody in this thread is saying this is bullshit . 
  so no , macron does it = also bad, 
  ah , makes more sense . 
  thanks, 
  yes . 
  you got me curious now , where is it considered a good beer ? 
  yes , it makes perfect sense in my opinion, 
  there 's been an update , it 's now allowed ( but it has to be a dark one ) . 
  and the fact that getting most votes does n't mean you are elected ? 
  what does immigration have to do with this article ? 
  also , it may be worth saying that the `` republican party '' in france is very different from the american one . 
  they would probably be considered dangerous `` socialists '' in the us,
