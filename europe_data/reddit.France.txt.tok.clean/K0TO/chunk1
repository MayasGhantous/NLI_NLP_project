there 's people from the philippines all over the world in cyprus there are large numbers of '' unskilled '' workers from the philippines , vietnam , sri lanka . 
  when i visited cyprus , i was told that having a ( live-in ) housemaid from one of these countries is extremely common among cypriots ( even those that are not '' rich '' ) . 
  they even have a special legal regime , where the wage of the maids is smth like 300 euros ( whereas the minimum wage in cyprus is around 800-900 euros i think ) . 
  the foreign worker regime also contains a prohibition on protest and assembly rights and forming trade unions ) . 
  ( as per the / r/europe news round-ups , there is lots of abuse of third-country workers in cyprus . ), 
  adding some more stuff : * superstitions everywhere !, 
  i ca n't bring myself to walk under an '' \u041b '' ( letter l ) , always '' sit for the road '' , throw spilled salt over my shoulder etc etc etc etc * russians do n't really use the equivalent of with '' mr/monsieur '' or '' mrs/mme '' / '' miss/mlle '' . 
  they use '' woman '' , '' man '' , '' young man '' , '' young woman '' when addressing people the names of whom they do n't know . 
  remnants from the soviet era . 
  '' evroremont '' is fixing up your flat/building/business according to '' european standards '' . 
  in reality it 's just fixing up your flat not to look like a 60s-80s soviet time capsule . 
  * moskovites are snobs ( surprise surprise . 
  this applies to any big city ) . 
  there 's even a running joke in moscow about whether there 's life beyond the moscow ring road ( \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u041c\u041a\u0410\u0414\u043e\u043c ? ) . 
  people living in the moscow region are '' \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0448\u0438 '' ( the '' beyond-the-ring-road-ers '' ) .

  i cringe so hard but ca n't stop listening . 
  how does one do this ? 
  cool like a fool in a swimming [ p-p-p-ppool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aoav7aykbe ), 
  i 've been following the news on what 's happening to russia for a while now . 
  i remember your news round-up right after the first incidents in sochi . 
  you said something along the lines of : '' russia just destroyed the image of a democratic , modern western-style image it 's been building up for the past 5 ( + ) years in a single day '' . 
  what do you think about the annexation of crimea and the subsequent eruption of the conflict ? 
  what does russia have to gain ( apart from the military base ) ? 
  was it worth all this ? 
  what is russia 's escape strategy ? 
  eherm , i think you mean [ taurica ] ( http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/03/24/russia-to-reinstate-crimea-with-greek-origins/ ), 
  might have something to do with slavic grammar . 
  it works exactly the same way in russian . 
  this works the exact same way for other types of measurement ( days , months , hours , minutes , metres , etc. 
  ) , and now that i think of it all nouns in general ( male nouns having one type of endings , female and neutral nouns following the same logic , but with different respective endings ) i do n't know if has to do with the consonant/vowel endings of the numbers , like op said . 
  not a linguist . 
  he might be/have been a student at the university of oslo . 
  it might be worth asking on the uio international students/uio events facebook pages .

  france . 
  with sfr it took a couple of weeks in total iirc . 
  this was in 2008 or smth , so things might have changed now . 
  went to the shop , filled out the docs , ( i went to some sort of post depot to pick up the router a few days later ) , set up an appointment for the technician ( which was approx 14 days away ) to come and connect me . 
  boom - internet . 
  shuddup you icicle, 
  of course we 've all got more immediate problems . 
  i just found it strange that it was n't mentioned as one of the first 10-20 problems . 
  privacy fatigue is kicking in the eu . 
  in the meantime the new privacy regulation places a lot of emphasis on individual control over information . 
  i 'm surprised that privacy is not on there, 
  am i missing something ? 
  since when can you not refuse entry to or expel illegal immigrants ? 
  why does the eu need a visa-free regime to be able to send illegals back to the port of entry ( or exit - that is turkey ) ? 
  i share your sentiment ( as a pro-european ) about the parliament deserving a ( gradually ) increasing position of power . 
  it has already come a long way . 
  however , the current arrangement seems most appropriate at the moment because the eu is not yet a '' federation '' in the legal sense , and there is a lot of reticence among politicians and the general population of it becoming one . 
  the current arrangement ensures that both the interests of the ms are advanced and protected ( by the com ) , eu interests are advanced and protected ( by the council ) , and we have a direct representation of the citizens ' interests ( by the ep ) . 
  so it 's a delicate balance . 
  at the moment , it 's the only thing that can work because of the reticence to a stronger more unified eu . 
  it 's actually regrettable that there is a wide-spread general opinion of the eu being a sort of independent body that keeps fucking with national '' good '' policies , as if eu ms do n't have any say in what happens at eu level . 
  this can only change when national govts adopt a more more pro-eu stance , which is difficult since no body wants to give up their sovereignty . 
  ( in short , from the national govt side , there needs to be less of '' eu telling us what to do , and we do n't like it '' . 
  and less national protectionist measures justified by arguments such as '' this bad law is from the eu , do n't blame us '' and more active participation on an eu level , a better exploitation of the benefits the eu provides , and a desire to promote the interests of the union as a whole rather than just national interests ) . 
  a more pro-eu feeling must spread among the citizens themselves . 
  they must understand the benefits of the union , and take more interest in advancing the union , which often means critically judging the merits of eu-blaming spread by their own national politicians . 
  only then can a parliament be constituted that actively reflects their opinions . 
  ( i 'm not going to go onto a discussion of the debate on the possibility or desirability of the eu becoming a federation , because this is long ... very long . 
  but , so far the eu has been strengthening its integration agenda , which is arguably working out pretty well . 
  it seems inevitable that some form of federation will eventually form , with a much stronger ep . ), 
  ye , the ep only has indirect legislative initiative since it can ask the com to submit a proposal . 
  do you think it matters at the moment though , since the turn-out for ep elections is still relatively low ? 
  that 's what i was thinking as well ... 
  i do n't mind the '' what do you like/know about x country questions '' at all here . 
  otherwise it would all be just news . 
  and people asking about travel advice or whatever are quite rare anyway , and are usually redirected to / r/travel or smth . 
  i 'd recommend the strasbourg and the nice ones in france .

  oh man , russia is going to be so pissed off, 
  ye , that was my exact thought as well ... 
  found them [ here ] ( http://photovide.com/flags-naturally/ ) edit : here 's another cool concept : flags made from the foods each country is commonly associated with : http://www.visualnews.com/2013/08/27/national-flags-created-foods-country-commonly-associated/, 
  russians still love germans a lot !, 
  and most people choose german as a second foreign language at school . 
  fun fact . 
  germans are called '' \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0446\u044b '' ( nemtsi ) in russian . 
  the meaning of the slavic word is ' a person who does n't speak coherently , clearly ' . 
  i wo n't be going on a wikipedia adventure , but i imagine the term goes way back to the time when the first germans came to russia and russians could n't understand what they were saying . 
  records from expeditions in 1588 also show the term was also used for norwegians , and even the english , dutch , prussians etc. 
  everyone else is of course the french  ( afaik they 're referred to as russian mountains in most latin languages : spanish , italian , portuguese etc. 
  and also in romanian . ), 
  it seems they are called russian mountains because they might have actually been invented by russians : [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roller_coaster#russian_mountain ) or [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_roller_coaster ), 
  russians actually call it '' olivier salad '' ( \u041e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044c\u0435 ) . 
  it 's named after lucien olivier , a russian chef of belgian origin who was the owner of the hermitage restaurant in the center of moscow in the early 1860s : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lucien_olivier they also call roller coasters '' american mountains '' , whereas everyone else calls them '' russian mountains '' . 
  you should also check out / r/basicincome . 
  there were some articles and explanations on the swiss proposal there as well . 
   make it illegal to perform surgery on the children for non-medicinal reasons i agree with you , but this might present a challenge . 
  plastic surgeries are sometimes performed for aesthetic reasons that improve the quality of life of children . 
  removal of some kind of huge and ugly but non-malignant wart or separation of fingers that are stuck together . 
  a better solution is a workable test to determine whether a surgery for primarily aesthetic reasons can greatly improve the quality of life of the child or whether the child is sufficiently mature to understand the consequences and validly consent to such a surgery . 
  a special committee or a judge would need to approve procedures in advance or on a case by case basis .
