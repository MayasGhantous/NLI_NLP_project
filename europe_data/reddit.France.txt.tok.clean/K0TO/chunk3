  i also liked this one : * la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9e de rendre les jeux vid\u00e9o violents * i think it loses its meaning through translation though . 
  society accused of making video games violent ? 
  society to blame for violent video games ? 
  ( does n't make much sense , not as funny ), 
  the correct answer would be ` false ' . 
  the percentage indicates how many people replied ` false ' which was the correct answer . 
  a few more titles : * paris : the pleasant waiter was in fact an imposter !, 
  * a software bug replaces the words '' taxes '' , '' unemployment '' and '' social '' with the word '' roma '' in all political discourses . 
  * poll : 89 % of men think that the clitoris is a toyota model . 
  * a facebook user starts a petition to be able to like his own likes . 
  * the vatican finally admits that dragons have '' perhaps '' never existed . 
  * 80 % of managers say that they 're not able to explain their role in the business world . 
  * red ants announce the creation of new colonies * 2/3 of football players will be incapable of calculating the 75 % income tax on their salaries . 
  i did n't phrase my question well . 
  i meant to ask whether individuals can be imprisoned for failing to pay debts owed to other natural or legal ( i.e. 
  private ) persons ? 
  ( this is what the concept of '' debtors prison '' refers to ) ( imprisonment for tax fraud or failing to pay fines imposed by the government is acceptable under international law . 
  imprisonment for failing to pay private debts is generally not , because no one should be imprisoned for failing to perform a contractual obligation ; debts owed to private entities can usually only stem from contractual obligations ), 
   prison full of people convicted for minor payment delays do you have debtor prisons in cyprus ? 
  are people being imprisoned for not paying private debts ? 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong . ), 
  those were abolished ages ago pretty much everywhere . 
  such practice is contrary to the iccpr art 11 and the echr . 
  modern '' debtor prisons '' exist only for indivs who fail to pay govt/public/court fines . 
  i changed a couple of things and got norway . 
  i see what you mean . 
  i guess the purpose of that question is to determine whether your habits ( or things you deem important ) coincide with those of the nationals of country x. e.g. 
  if you go to church for whatever reason ( because you 're religious , because of social duty , tradition , to socialise etc ) , you might not fit in well in country x where people generally do n't attend church regularly ( because they do n't believe attending religious services every week is a tradition worth preserving , are not religious etc. ), 
  i 'd say it 's asking whether you think job satisfaction is important , to see if your * views * coincide with those of the citizens/residents of the various countries . 
  yep , i saw that it was posted 5 months ago , but figured it would be fun for anyone who has n't seen it yet . 
  i got denmark btw . 
  * shudders * at lutefisk . 
  i tried to try it . 
  wtf norway ? 
  that might violate the geneva conventions on standards for the humanitarian treatment of war . 
  mighty cheese bomb = alien nose death !, 
  how to : amass all cheese in the entire country , let it * mature * in a warm place , unleash the mighty cheese bomb . 
  i ca n't really understand your argument . 
  do you know how reverse engineering works ? 
  crudely , to reverse engineer a piece of software you must first * legally * obtain it ( e.g. 
  buy or download the software ) , and then '' see/analyse how it works '' . 
  this case is about an alleged intellectual property infringement of the skype software by individuals . 
  copyright covers both source and object code , which is why you ca n't just '' copy '' it . 
  reverse engineering a program is completely legal both under eu computer programs directive art . 
  6 and under us law ( dmca sec . 
  so it 's no surprise that the court recognized that reverse engineering is a legal practice . 
  reverse engineering is allowed mainly for intercompatibility purposes / other fair use . 
  so it 's usually not a good idea to create a program the * source code * of which is almost identical to the program you reverse engineered . 
  however , you can replicate the functionality of a program you reverse engineered and write your own ( granted the functionality must not be identical , but you can write a similar program that contains other features making it substantially different from the software you reverse engineered . ), 
  reverse engineering is very important for software innovation ; that 's why it 's an exception to copyright infringement . 
  i understand that in us law software is often covered as a trade secret . 
  but reverse engineering has nothing to do with violating a trade secret clause . 
  moreover , there is no protection when a trade secret is uncovered by reverse engineering . 
  that depends on the specific country 's residence requirements . 
  nah , the facial structure is too '' non-nordic '' . 
  just look at the wide nose and thick lips . 
  i would n't immediately say he 's nordic cleaned up or not . 
  this is very interesting . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  the article presents us with the human side of the story . 
  we empathise with the poor girl and her family . 
  but we are not given enough details about their circumstances either , so some of us just put ourselves in their position and go : poor family , bad policemen . 
  but i agree with you that we should n't lose sight of the bigger picture . 
  france has enormous immigration problems . 
  a quick search of some french sites reveals that there are over 300 000 illegal immigrants in france at any given time . 
  and the immigration laws are not completely inhumane . 
  illegal immigrants have access to free medical aid/hospitalisation . 
  they can also get married ( illegal status is not a legal obstacle ) . 
  when people are to be deported they are usually notified in advance ( usually 2 or 3 times ) by the way . 
  they are also usually given time to leave themselves : e.g. 
  you must leave the territory within the next 2 months . 
  there are also processes for '' regularisation '' of illegal immigrants . 
  granted , an illegal immigrant must have stayed in france for 5 years ( or more ) and there are admin burdens ( as usual ) . 
  but there are about 30 000 '' regularisations '' each year . 
  edit : i also saw on euronews today that they lost their case seeking asylum , so they were not unaware of the deportation order . 
  and all the judges , rapporteurs and everyone else could mingle and have coffee together !, 
  i 've seen how some recruiters recruit translators . 
  the recruiters might not speak the language themselves , but ask the applicant to speak about a certain topic in the language . 
  ( the applicant usually does n't know the recruiter does n't speak the language , so he tries his best to impress him ) . 
  the recruiter listens to determine whether the person is speaking with confidence , whether he pauses to think etc. 
  ( you get the picture ) . 
  it 's not perfect , but perhaps traditional tests where the immigration officer asks questions is the only viable solution at the moment . 
  i agree that asylum seekers might not conform to our western standards ( esp cultural ones ) as you mentioned , but other types of questions can be asked that would allow the officer to determine the genuine nature of his claim . 
  he could ask questions about personal experiences , about events etc. 
  i guess he 'd be able to tell if the applicant is lying ( when he takes too long to answer , looks away etc ) . 
  do you currently have a boyfriend/girlfriend ? 
  what do they look like ? 
  what do you like best about them ? 
  how often to you see each other a week ? 
  how did you meet . 
  what present did they get you for your birthday ? 
  i mean this is probably how they check whether a person is being persecuted for political reasons as well when he lacks sufficient material evidence . 
  i do n't see how . 
  maybe a violation of the right to dignity ... but an fmri test seems pretty non-intrusive compared to asking for photographic evidence . 
  however , fmri patterns might not be completely reliable , since the person might be turned on by both hetero - and homo-sexual sex sences . 
  \u043a\u043e\u0431\u044b\u043b ** \u0430 ** = female horse ( in sayings and in literature the word usually refers to work horses as opposed to riding or race horses ) http://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%ea%ee%e1%fb%eb%e0 also used for fugly women , 
  it 's not the ' \u041b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u044c ' ( horse ) that becomes ' \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0447\u0435 ' ( lighter ) itself . 
  ' \u043a\u043e\u0431\u044b\u043b ** \u0435 ** ' means '' for the horse '' ( the noun is conjugated in russian ) . 
  so it becomes easier/lighter * for * the horse . 
  or literally : to/for the horse , easier .
