  ( russian horse into easier !, 
   `` the one who shits without preparation looks for a stone while squatting down '' why '' stone '' ? 
  does the stone play some role in pooping ? 
  bad stuff : - lots of money laundering !, 
  off-shore zone . 
  became wealthy with influx of grey russian money . 
  russians are leaving as far as i hear because the banking system went boom . 
  read that banks and government officials were involved in the laundering of milosevic 's money , which was also the reason hsbc left cyprus . 
  ( quick search only gives me a [ local newspaper source ] ( http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/08/11/confirmed-the-econ-probe-is-a-farce/ ) ) * lots of corruption in the govt . 
  * wtf : do not harvest solar energy !, 
  built wind turbines instead . 
  the island depends on imported oil for practically 100 % of its energy . 
  again , wtf !, 
  * do not recycle . 
  the commission brought a case against cyprus before the ecj for non-compliance with the landfill directive . 
  iirc they 've been taken to the ecj by the commission over environmental issues on several occasions and have been already fined for a few things . 
  * i heard that the mentality is way too '' easy-going '' / lack long-term planning , making it difficult for eu/foreign businessmen/professionals to do business there . 
  * used to be ( still is ? ), 
  very expensive . 
  * property sales everywhere !, 
  ( some scandals , some rip offs ) * mercedes taxis . 
  no public transport . 
  good stuff : * very good cuisine . 
  mix of med , greek , turkish , middle eastern . 
  yum yum !, 
  * clean , pretty beaches . 
  maybe good stuff : * found natural gas reserves . 
  * want to implement basic income . 
  ( hmmm ... ) other stuff : * speak a dialect of greek which sounds very different from mainland greek . 
  there were attempts ( i think ) of elevating its status to that of a a language , as not only words are different , but there are sounds that do n't exist in the greek language . 
  * all the girls look the same !, 
  same clothes , tons of make-up , really high heels all the time !, 
  really over-dress . 
  * very very strong family attachment . 
  grown-up children often still live with parents . 
  * really love greece . 
  i understand the historical attachment , but the cypriots i know say that everyone follows greek news , politics etc. 
  * very troubled history . 
  ( not the eu ) [ zelenograd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zelenograd ) was/is considered the '' soviet/russian silicon valley '' . 
  it 's an artificial city outside moscow built in 1958 expressly as a centre for electronics research ( etc. ), 
  from wikipedia :  [ it ] was one of the most powerful centers of electronics , microelectronics and computer industry in the soviet union , and it still plays a similar role in modern russia . 
  it was developed as a reflection of the california silicon valley and known also as soviet/russian silicon valley . 
  by passing a law that prohibits the use of these letters in ( e.g. ), 
  written form . 
  ah , governments !, 
  in the eu , you ca n't limit any form of social aid/benefits ( and the like ) only to your own nationals . 
  that 's direct discrimination , prohibited by tfeu article 45 on free movement of persons ( and the citizenship directive ) . 
  ( there is a tonne of ecj caselaw on this ) however , being eligible to receive any kind of social aid can depend on residence conditions . 
  these residence conditions are non-discriminatory since they apply in the same way to your own nationals and other eu nationals . 
  i do n't remember how it works in switzerland exactly ( too lazy to start digging through laws !, 
  ) , because they 're not part of the eu/eea , but i think the tfeu provision on free movement of persons applies to them by virtue of a treaty they signed in 1999 ( iirc ) . 
  this is why i think the conditions to receive it will hinge on long-term residence , and that the conditions will be rather stringent . 
  ( that 's how it has worked so far with all sorts of benefits in the eu . ), 
  so going back to my point in the previous post on how bi might have negative repercussions on other eu citizens who want to live/work in switzerland : if salaries drop due to bi , those non-swiss nationals who do n't qualify for bi might have a hard time making ends meet . 
  this is not that nice for non-qualifying eu citizens , but quite good for swiss nationals since they 'll be able to take up jobs even even if the salaries are smaller . 
  hence , it could be considered a measure that protects swiss nationals ( in a de facto rather than legal way ) . 
  so you think salaries will drop if bi is implemented ? 
  this is interesting because eu citizens/foreign nationals who might not qualify for swiss bi might be affected . 
  my reasoning is that there will surely be residence conditions ( e.g. 
  5 + years or permanent swiss residence ) to receive it , since switzerland wo n't be able to discriminate v. other eu citizens by making only swiss nationals eligible ( iirc there 's a treaty on free movement of persons even though you 're not part of the eea ) . 
  being able to drop salaries would mean only swiss nationals ( recipients of bi ) will be able to afford to work in switzerland . 
  which is great for nationals . 
  i wonder whether bi could be deemed some sort of de facto ( rather than legal ) barrier ( such as a hidden protective measure ) to the free movement of persons under these circumstances . 
  the ecthr has [ upheld the ban ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare_party ) of an islamist political party by the turkish government for violating the the principle of secularism in the turkish constitution . 
  it has refused disbanding other parties however . 
  this is just to say that political parties can be banned , and the ban might or might not be upheld by the echr . 
  i wonder whether greece is going to go through with the ban . 
  freedom of assembly is a particularly important right in democratic societies . 
  however , even france where freedom of assembly is very very important and well protected has already [ banned several far-right movements ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20130725-france-far-right-groups-banned-islamism-extremism ) . 
  the rationale is :  while banning groups will have `` little impact '' on the politics of their supporters , the `` gesture '' of banning an organisation sends a strong message that the government is fighting extremism `` in all its forms '' , he said . 
  i do n't like it personally , but it 's quite popular in france . 
  there are two main kinds - the smooth one and the chunky gelatinous '' terrine '' . 
  russians like it as well ; it 's called '' pashtet '' ( \u043f\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0442 ) and resembles the french '' terrine '' . 
  very good !, 
  what are they saying right at the end ( in hungarian ) ? 
  yep . 
  this is remedying the effects and not the cause . 
  very informative !, 
  found a nice catch-22 as well :  reserve fuel is often calculated as a percentage of trip fuel , but trip fuel ca n't be calculated until the total weight of the aircraft is known and this includes the weight of the reserve fuel . 
  edit : seems i replied to the wrong post, 
  inspired by / u/gopetfriendly 's post on his [ childhood in bulgaria ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1phslk/photos_that_have_identified_my_childhood_in/ ) . 
  i though it might be interesting to see what objects , experiences , foods , sweets europeans associate with their childhood in different countries . 
  we could try to keep this interesting ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ avoid ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ 90s ^ ^ ^ ^ kids ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ remember by posting photos of stuff that you think might have been specific to growing in your country e.g. 
  : * what games did you play in school ( [ on paper ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/thumb/7/73/battleship_russian.svg/502px-battleship_russian.svg.png ) or otherwise ) * what did your parents cook you for breakfast ? 
  * toys you liked * sweets * school uniforms/rules ? 
  * what hat did you used to wear in winter ? 
  you could also mention when you grew up - 70s , 80s , 90s etc. 
  have you had any fun experiences during your budget travels , / r/europe ? 
  i 'll start with a ryanair flight that makes me laugh every time i recall it . 
  i was flying with ryanair from norway to italy or greece for 11 euros or something like that . 
  boarding was finally annouced . 
  we all line up with our carry-ons . 
  in front of me is a family - balkans ( sorry guys ) of four - mother , father , two childern . 
  let 's call them '' the pot family '' . 
  so these guys do n't have any carry-on bags with them . 
  instead , three of them are carrying plastic bags filled with clothes and the father is holding a flower pot at least 60cm in diameter . 
  a flower pot . 
  now this is not a pretty pot or anything . 
  this is an absolutely normal ( read : shitty ) white ceramic pot to plant flowers in or some shit . 
  they approach the dreaded ryanair metal luggage constricter box where you have to cram your oversized backpack in ( you know the box i 'm talking about , fellow european budget traveller ) .
