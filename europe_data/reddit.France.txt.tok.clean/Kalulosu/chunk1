this is interpretation , so it 's of course very subjective , and cultural . 
  france has a very peculiar relation to religion . 
  we 've been designated as `` the church 's elder daughter '' for so long , that when the revolution came it blew up in the opposite direction . 
  even today , the topics of `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' is very touchy . 
  now , if you look at charlie hebdo , they 're fundamentally anti-religion . 
  they despise all religions , it 's why they publish so many satires of religion ( hence why they were called islamophobic after the attacks , even though they have produced even more anti-catholic stuff than anti-islam ! ) . 
  anyway , their stance - i feel - is that christians ( not all of them of course ) practice double speak in that they 'll call on to christian charity publicly , but will take a political stance to refuse the refugees ( `` we ca n't receive them '' ) . 
  and it would be some kind of hypocrisy to say `` see , they do n't belong here , the kid drowned '' . 
  as for the other one , i believe that it 's a bit clearer : the contrast between a child who was forced on this boat , and basically ended up there because we did n't ok refugees coming in , and the symbol of abundance ( mcdonald 's offering 2 kids menu for the price of 1 ! ) . 
  we are selfish and we consider that our little comfort should not be troubled by those refugees . 
  the child is `` so close '' ... and it 's our fault . 
  once again that 's how i see it . 
  i 'm not even saying they 're right or wrong , but i see it as a revolt ( that 's mostly what charlie hebdo is about ) against the inaction and even the rejection that those refugees ( or , as the medias call them , `` migrants '' , as if they were just coming to europe to get a job ) are met with . 
  they 're not mocking the kid , they 're mocking those who think that they can justify that kid 's death . 
  dear dclauzel i 'd have loved to translate this in french , be it only to piss off some negative minds around here , but i 'm too lazy , and i hope you 'll forgive me for that . 
  or maybe your in-laws like you and are fucking with you , in true french form . 
  be careful with that , [ it actually depends in which region you 're going ] ( http://combiendebises.free.fr/ ) . 
  bordeaux being supposedly 2 kisses !, 
  the point is , there are matters that have impact on a far wider scale than `` just '' some guy getting killed . 
  is that tragic ? 
  of course , any death is tragic . 
  but people should realize - and maybe the media could try and push for that - that you ca n't just take that death and ramble on forever . 
  i mean , we had our fair share of attacks in france , and sure enough i 'd love it if these were the lasts . 
  but let 's be real , until hatred is erased from this world ( lol ) , it 's just gon na happen . 
  i still have a way higher probability of getting bumped by a car and killed by a truck running me over than i have of ever encountering a muslim terrorist , yet you do n't see me complaining about cars . 
  more importantly , those events are used to promote unhealthy reactions and politics . 
  in france , for example , we 're facing a wave of sickening calls to reduce freedom and boost government surveillance . 
  surveillance already happens . 
  most of the guys who commited terror acts ( all of them actually iirc ! ), 
  in the recent years * were * under surveillance . 
  what good it did to us . 
  the point is , by focusing too much on those issues , we 're losing sight of what we should do and instead adopt a reactionary attitude which only leads to disaster ( ffs we had 5 years of sarkozy whose motto was pretty much `` 1 event = 1 law '' , and it created a spaghetti of bullshit , can we try to steer clear of that ? ) . 
  more importantly , we 're also losing sight of our identity , by focusing on a negative definition . 
  europe is n't `` a chance for peace and unity '' , it 's no longer the incredible force that brought together enemies of old , it 's `` against islamism ( read muslims ? 
  ) '' , `` against terrorists '' , against ... i do n't want to define myself or my country or the organizations my country takes part in negatively . 
  i just do n't . 
  i believe that 's exactly how you destroy anything of value your society ever created . 
  sigh, 
  same here about online gaming . 
  i love french , but seriously , i 'm just embarrassed when people will spew up french in a public setting where there 's a good number of non-french speakers . 
  also french have a reputation ( deserved or not ) for being very isolationists and refusing to speak in english in those contexts , so it does n't really give an incentive to start up in french . 
   you stop trusting reddit 's self-declared progressivism . 
  a community that grows to the size that reddit has can not remain progressive in its majority , imo, 
  you seem to know an awful lot about that . 
  do you know why he was condemned ? 
  hint : [ it 's not because he made fun of the jews ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/dieudonn%c3%a9#proc.c3.a8s_intent.c3.a9s_contre_dieudonn.c3.a9 ) ( [ there is a less detailed english version ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dieudonn%c3%a9_m'bala_m'bala#court_actions ) ) . 
   mr craven was arrested under section 4a of the public order act 1986 , which criminalises the use of insulting words with the intention of causing harassment , alarm or distress . 
    section 4a requires intention to cause harassment , alarm or distress unlike section 5 , which requires intention to use threatening or abusive words or behaviour . 
    [ ... ]   `` so long as they stay within the law , do n't incite violence or mayhem , they should be able to make whatever point they want , and their opponents should be able to respond without causing a disturbance or calling the police . 
  being insulted is not a good enough reason to have someone thrown into a police cell . '', 
  nope . 
   make fun of jews ( illegal in france ) not true . 
  * technically * that 's two centuries away  and the monarchies since 1789 have n't really lasted . 
  we have n't cared about royalty for centuries , my man . 
  that 's a pretty boring story though . 
  i prefer mel gibson giving speeches and painting his face blue . 
  oh you 're not alone in that . 
  many countries are going this route , because it fits the dominant economic narrative . 
  even france has many politicians pushing towards this route , we just started so far away from it that resistance is more efficient ( we have more safety nets to defend ) . 
  for example , many elevate germany as the be-all end-all because the country has a low unemployment rate and its economy is doing well , but that 's of course without ever touching on many problematics , like the same low pay jobs you have in the uk . 
  all in all i feel it 's less about the countries being `` bad '' themselves , but also about politicians accepting that things are changing . 
  we ca n't chase the dream of full employment , not at the costs it represents now . 
  were n't any significant ww1 battle out there . 
  even ww2 did n't rage so hard in the south . 
  napol\u00e9on was very much a federalist in the same vein as charlemagne was . 
  basically pragmatists thinking `` i ca n't expect a central government to control everything , so i 'll give regions more leeway so i 'm not bothered by farm boys stories '' . 
  that 's what i mean . 
  sure the park is n't done and the metro station will probably never be fully up to par ( it 's so fucking huge and there 's such a crazy traffic of people in there ... ) , but i 've never seen the station so neat and usable , and i 've never seen the street-level halles being such a nice place . 
  that 's something . 
  you just asked `` why '' about anime . 
  never do that buddy . 
  it 's honestly pretty ok now . 
  more like they 're egoists and they 'll vote for the right in hope that it 'll benefit them at the cost of others . 
  then they get fucked over , but will still buy the lies that they 'll get the bigger part of the cake in the next election . 
  not exactly last , since they have qualified for the event . 
  [ ** any activity that uses physical ** exertion or ** skills competitively under a set of rules that is not based on aesthetics . 
  ** ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sport ) ( emphasis mine ) . 
  there are physical skills in timing or precision . 
  yeah , that 's from the bible . 
  more precisely , from the deuteronomy , a part of the bible not really known for being nice or forgiving . 
  i did n't quote it as a `` you should follow those rules '' , but i did quote it as an example that even extreme religious people would n't dare pin the sins of the fathers onto their son . 
  so why would you pin the sins of a grandfather onto their grandsons ?

  i think that the ideology of communism refers to the ideas developped by marx and engel 's manifesto , and as such never encouraged genocide . 
  the nazi ideology did . 
  sovietism did . 
  totalitarianism in general did in europe . 
  i 'm not a german so obviously i 'll expect you take what i say with caution , but iirc the max penalty is a fine + 3 years of prison for displaying nazi symbols ( including the hitler salute / heil hitler / sieg heil ) . 
  and of course that 's the * maximum * penalty , i do n't think a german court would sentence a stupid american tourist doing a hitler salute for `` fun '' while drunk to give him a huge fine + 3 years in prison . 
  i mean you 're using a clip from competitive smash , so yeah . 
  it 's banned in a lot of countries where it did damage . 
  and one would remind you that it 's sovietism that killed people . 
  this is insanity .
