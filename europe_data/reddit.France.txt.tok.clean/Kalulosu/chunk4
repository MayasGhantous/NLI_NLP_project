  a french from the continent would tell you `` but come on bill it iz obviousse you should proanounce it a-jak-sio '' . 
  because we tend to do that , we take a town 's name and pronounce it in a way that fits our language . 
  just like you 'd hear `` niou iork '' or `` ouashingtonne '' over here . 
  for the guys in corsica it 'll depend if you ask someone who 's `` moderately corsican '' or `` full-on corsican '' ( by which i mean , how corsica-nationalistic do they feel ? ) . 
  if they really go for the corsican one ( aiacciu ) then it 'd be something like `` a-ya-tchou '' . 
  the italian pronounciation ( since corsica is in italia now i guess that 's the official one right ? 
  :  ) would be the same but ending in an o sound . 
  if you want ipa write-ups you 've got the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ajaccio ) . 
  italian if we are to believe trump apparently :  and i mostly meant that napoleon 's empire was napoleon 's first , and french second . 
  we do have batshit right wingers and they do express themselves more now than they used to , but the proliferation that we observe for you guys is insane ( to me at least and i think to many europeans ) . 
  it 's also pretty clear that trumpers used a lot of bots and those kind of stereotypical `` huh huh libruhl tears '' comments are so inane and empty that i think it really makes us question whether those are real people posting . 
  it 's less pregnant here ( for now ... ) . 
  oh we love 'em alright , just like you love that clown at the circus . 
  he 's very funny and you love watching him do clown stuff , but you would n't want him in your house . 
  i 'd love to hear him say that , just because i 'm sure his pronounciation of ajaccio would be fucking hilarious, 
  1/4th french edit : unless you 're talking about that time when we stopped fucking around , but let 's be honest it never was french , just napoleonian, 
  but he 's got many wives , so you guys should like him right ? 
  merci . 
  she knows all about fighting , does n't she ? 
  it could be bud . 
   france already has the highest retirement age in europe i suppose you mean `` lowest '' . 
   overly strike-happy unions yeah , a shame workers have rights . 
   legendarily short working hours sure there 's a legend . 
  sure we 're supposed to be working 35h a week . 
  but many do n't . 
  we often work more than that , with more or less compensation afterwards . 
  more importantly , french workers are very productive ( maybe thanks to those `` legendarily short working hours '' ) . 
  fancy that . 
  look , i 'm all for constructive criticism of the system , but if you 're just going to say '' change all you do and do like the others because it 's better '' i 'm going to say that 's a very stupid statement . 
   hollande was more like , `` not my fault it 's the crisis i took a bet and lost '' . 
  wuss and ostrich tactic . 
  yes and no . 
  you 're painting things in a very unfavorable light , and even though i 'm not going to pretend that all is well , hollande at least tried to change things . 
  it was very unpopular , it was n't a short-term solution which does n't help with the feeling that he did n't do anything , and he promised things would get better in under a year , which was extremely stupid , and i 'm being polite . 
  megaman makes it cooler tbh, 
  i think your loss is showing . 
  yeah the vote of no confidence allows the assembl\u00e9e nationale to repeal the law and force the government to resign . 
  still it 's a pretty big ordeal to force . 
  and in the history of the 5th republic , only one has ever been adopted ( in 1962 ) . 
  the government can also edict `` ordonnances '' , by asking the assembl\u00e9e to give them the right to pass laws without a vote on a set topic ( for example organization of the public life or something like that ) . 
  but of course that too requires a majority in the first place . 
  it 's trickier . 
  you ask for the permission to go over them beforehand ( so without them knowing the extent of what they intend to pass ) . 
  there is also a control * a posteriori * but some amount of damage can already be done . 
  the real risk is that the president can require `` full powers '' for 1 month and with very little in the way of control ( for example there is no way to deny him that ) . 
  please do , i do n't mind . 
  you do you . 
  difference being , the fn has never denounced that past . 
  some of which were actually slamming him . 
  lol ok if nothing in what i quoted is evil , sure , you presented and evil and a solution . 
  ahhh yes of course , the lesser of two evils . 
  how could i not see that ... 
  wait a minute , this is stupid because they 're not the solution . 
   proposed censorship i just quoted two examples of that actually . 
   violent opposition suppression fn mayors have done just that . 
   she 's been censored how ? 
  florian philippot has basically a full-time job of being on tv . 
  but yeah she 's `` censored '' . 
   the eu is seizing control of industry lol, 
  i 'm talking about character and inclinations . 
  the system is the same for both but the fn 's history of handling things is very reminiscent of fascist methods . 
  what 's to stop them if they get access to the biggest trove of power in our republic ? 
  how do you know ? 
  how can you be so sure ? 
  are you a mind reader ? 
  are you very knowledgeable about the fn ? 
  i 've seen firsthand what these guys aim to do . 
  i know people who joined them and i heard what they think of contradiction and opposition . 
  i ca n't be confident that they wo n't try that and i do n't want to take the chance when i can avoid it . 
  and all of that is not even taking into account that they have the wrong solutions to the wrong problems politically . 
  but it does n't even matter because there 's way worse at stake . 
   a person granted absolute emergency power well guess what , [ we have that ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_16_de_la_constitution_de_la_cinqui%c3%a8me_r%c3%a9publique_fran%c3%a7aise ) , and the president can grant themselves those absolute emergency power without any oversight . 
  i also did n't say she 'd `` repeal democracy '' , but it 's a distinct possibility . 
  nice argumentation though `` you 're young and stupid lol '' . 
  same to you buddy . 
  oh please . 
  she went to him to get financing for her campaign . 
  do you really think she got rid of him ? 
  she chose to distance herself from him to have chances at getting elected but she did n't seem to mind him when she was his campaign director ... as for the press : * [ a fn official calls for an `` order of journalists '' to `` punish bad practices '' ] ( http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualite-economique/le-fn-souhaite-creer-un-ordre-des-journalistes-selon-un-cadre_1903831.html ) * [ 29 journalist societies point out the fn 's attemps to restrain the freedom of information ] ( http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualite-economique/le-fn-souhaite-creer-un-ordre-des-journalistes-selon-un-cadre_1903831.html ) by selecting which journalists can cover their campaign . 
  they excluded france 24 and the afp , which are very neutral ( the afp a french reuters-like press agency ffs ) so yeah, 
  i am french , so fuck off with telling me that , thanks . 
  and i did n't say she was hitler . 
  i did n't say she was going to commit genocide . 
  i do , however , think she 's a tangible and very real threat to our freedom and could damage our democracy enough that she 's too much of a threat to allow to be in power . 
  that , to me , is the very definition of a dictator . 
  i mean , i know but even for then it 's shit lol, 
  that sucks : /, 
  yes i know . 
  how do * you * know she 's not going to repeal democracy ? 
  in every one of the towns where the fn got a mayor , they 've been abusing their power . 
  even while not being in power they 've constantly been pushing agressive policies wrt people 's freedom . 
  they do n't care about freedom and they wo n't uphold it . 
  if there 's anyone that can turn into a dictator upon being elected president , it 's her . 
  and there are more tools to be a dictator now than there have ever been in the history of the 5th republic ( and there were quite a lot to begin with ) . 
  [ mec ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_16_de_la_constitution_de_la_cinqui%c3%a8me_r%c3%a9publique_fran%c3%a7aise ) . 
  see the problem is , you have the choice to avoid going through the whole bloody ordeal . 
  i 'd rather we did that . 
  i agree . 
  i do n't support either of them but le pen actually * frightens * me because there is 0 guarantee she wo n't turn into a dictator . 
  and our institutions do leave that option open .
