do n't worry , you still have the better wurst . 
  because no one is willing to pay the $ $ $ , while as you stated , they do n't make people feel safer . 
  either that or wait for some greek national to come here with a better answer than every single one you 'll find here . 
  i was not down to mcdonald 's level , that shit is disgusting , if that can reassure you . 
  in picardie they seem to make a few efforts at least , but i think it 's to avoid a public outrage here . 
  i 'm not sure it 's that common for people to make fries at home , especially since it 's the most avalaible side dish in restaurants and food chains . 
  also , pommes de terres saut\u00e9es of course . 
  life 's gon na be happy on the most sterile environments known to humanity . 
  do you pay for fuel ? 
  there 's a shit-ton of people fleeing away from paris , but there 's a shit-ton more moving to it . 
  housing in paris costs around 50 % more than the rest of france , while for the rest it 's around 3-10 % more expensive ( excepts alcohol which is basically the same price ) . 
  * parisian accent : people who pretend to have a culture * not parisian accent : people who do n't pretend to have a culture, 
  of mice and men takes a whole new meaning to me . 
  i had a hard time finding the answer , they hid it in small letters at the bottom of their offer . 
  bottom of page 3 of the [ pdf ] ( https://mobile.free.fr/docs/tarifs.pdf ) . 
  basically , they ask `` reasonable use of their services '' . 
  they consider that an usage is abusive when your international consumption/presence on the international is way over the national ( french ) consumption/presence over a period of ** 4 months ** , or prolonged sim inactivity . 
  in these cases , free mobile reserves the right to make you pay communications at the current rate ( available [ here ] ( http://mobile.international.free.fr/?pays=allemagne ) . 
  sadly , i 've just noticed that ** you need to justify a frequent and signicative presence in france ** to apply to the offer . 
  i think with free you get for 20 $ / month : unlimited call/sms/mms +5 go data in whole europe/ca/us / aus ( 100 go of data in france ) . 
  i do n't know how easy/hard it is to subscribe from abroad though . 
  might be an italian banking crisis . 
  why would people care about that thing ? 
  live , yes , but on quite low standards . 
  however , you have to take into account that , according to the french constitution , every citizen has the right to get a work , and has the duty to work . 
  basically , this means that you have to be unable to work to live on state 's welfare . 
  not really ( on my own view , i ca n't answer for other people ) , since i hardly have an opinion about the people of a country . 
  there can be tendencies from the culture , which can either be on the plus or minus side of an opinion , but culture will be culture and people will be people . 
  it 's just not possible to generalize an opinion about people . 
  if you ask me , i dislike huge parts of american culture , but this has nothing to do with d. trump . 
  that 's it , children 's right first . 
  it 's more of a psychological research that takes 20 + years than of an ideological fight . 
  alsace and moselle were n't french when churches were separated from the state . 
  this basically means that these poor guys have religion courses at school ( they can have a derogation under parent 's demand ) , but also that these fuckers have two more public holiday . 
  nobles no longer have privileges since 1789 , and aristocracy is no longer recognized by france since 1870 . 
  obviously , there still are descendants from said nobles [ that lived through ] ( http://imgur.com/a/btnkt ) the reign of terror in 1789-1794 . 
  some of these nobles got to keep their heritage through generations , whether it 's castles or culture ( i.e. 
  some families may have kept contact with other famillies ) . 
  there are a few pathologic cases who acts as royalist like [ henry de lesquen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_de_lesquen ) , but these guys are considered as jokes by the rest of french society . 
  castles are extremely expensive to maintain , so most of them are either falling apart , used for tourism ( bed and breakfast or publicly funded for most special ones ) , or have been bought by some random rich guy . 
  in the [ hercynian forest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hercynian_forest ) , you can find bisons , elks , aurochs , wolves , bears , hyenas , leopards , lynxes and much more . 
  i 'm incredibly sad to say that it was 2000 years ago , and that the only remnant of the hercynian forest is the [ bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bia%c5%82owie%c5%bca_forest ) in poland/belarus . 
  there are some bisons ( reintroduced ) , wild horses , bears , etc. 
  most informations of the hercynian forest are recollected from pline the elder and julius caesar . 
  in france that would be sncf or total , for people with a bachelor at least . 
  excellent working conditions , nice bonuses ( who said free train ? 
  ) , and guaranteed stability . 
  m\u00e6rsk in denmark i think too . 
  mostly '' * wtf are they trying to accomplish ? * '' . 
  especially since no one seems to be able to find some relevant illegal thing ( atm ) . 
  survival i guess ? 
  maybe killing time in the meanwhile . 
  to be honest , i find this poll quite representative of what the conversations have been on the sub for the past few months . 
  compared to france as a whole , only fillon and le pen have been extremely underrepresented on / r/france . 
  i ca n't remember of more than 4 or 5 posts defending fillon 's positions . 
  there were a lot more for le pen , although even when in minority her supporters know how to be quite vocal . 
  obviously an online community is bullshit compared to the scale of a national election . 
  more like [ this ] ( http://www.strawpoll.me/12475452/r ) ( / r/france poll ) : m\u00e9lenchon 33 % , macron 24 % , hamon 14 % , le pen 5 % , undecided 6 % , abstention + blank 10 % , rest < 2 % each ( including fillon ) conservative liberals ( lr ) and nationalists fn are severly under represented on / r/france compared to france overall . 
  i 've discovered this sub quite recently . 
  to be honest , i know almost nothing from eastern europe , and one of the main reason i 'd like to stay a little longer is to learn more about its countries ( and because there 's a civil war on / r/france right now , this sub feels like a haven of peace in comparison ), 
  yup , we definitively disagree on the matter . 
  there 's a ton of implications for both models and we can hardly measure or predict their respective impacts on the larger scale though . 
  sadly , you are right . 
  we have a huge lobby , fnsea ( national federation of agricultural holder 's union ) which has been pushing agriculture towards more and more industrialized farms . 
  no tax harmonization . 
  and cap . 
  not really , and i doubt we 'll get any tangible policy for the next 5 years . 
  not really , though we might encounter sceptics from time to time on the internet . 
  mostly hard liberals who are sceptics by ideology because they abhor government 's impositions . 
  we 're deeply fucked and we 'd better act fast to define a strong energy policy shift and develop resilience plans ( mostly for water , agriculture and climate refugees ) . 
  i consume as less as i can . 
  i 'm about to get employed for the first time since i 've just finished my studies , and i will need a car on a day to day basis which is enough to piss me off quite a bit . 
  currently , entertainment mostly comes from outdoor activities with little to no car involved , and internet things . 
  ooohh the same story happened to a friend ( without the hedge of roses ) . 
  he wore a 5 centimeters scar on the face for quite a few months after that . 
  not really , market is already filled by kronenbourg , heineken , and leffe on the higher end . 
  i had to check online for [ full statistics ] ( https://fr.statista.com/statistiques/509431/habitudes-restauration-midi-francais/ ) concerning workers . 
  35 % bring their own food , 25 % go buy a sandwich outside of work , 20 % work canteen , 15 % eat at home , 4 % in a restaurant , and i would n't like to be among the last 1 % . 
  though , it 's mostly employees of large firms ( 50 + ) who have an access to work canteens . 
  mostly out of public debate , apart from a few interviews with [ matthieu ricard ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthieu_ricard ) here and there . 
  the topic is slowly but surely gaining ground though . 
  because there is a stupid amount of unnecessary math in any project that involves the imperial system . 
  also , us seem quite alone along with a few countries in using the imperial system . 
  illegal , i guess . 
  basically , hadopi law , voted in 2009 , has set a frame for graduated responses to copyright enfringements when downloading . 
  however , this law had barely any impact on illegal downloads , despite its high cost (  10m $ ) : * only torrents are monitored . 
  as you might have guessed , most people transfered to streaming and direct downloads . 
  some learnt to use vpns . 
  * legal offer is still pathetic , which make illegal downloads are more convenient in most cases ( i.e. 
  without considering the cost ) . 
  * only a few copyrighted contents are monitored by hadopi , so that 's about blockbusters and major albums releases . 
  * in case of enfringement , graduated response consists in one warning email , followed by one warning registered letter , and then law pursuits . 
  in the 2009 -  2015 period , 7.5 millions warning emails were sent , 622000 letters , 1000 files forwaded to the public prosecutor 's office , 39 went to court . 
  i do n't know how many were condemned . 
  fun fact is , you 're fully responsible if your neighbour pirated your wifi to download musics . 
  also , most people do n't care about internet piracy ; some care about not receiving letter in their own house though . 
  of course , you still exist , though i must admit that i live 1000 kilometers away , and that i know very little about you catalans . 
  someday i 'll pay a visit to you guys ... 
  i think i 'm doomed for writing this . 
  [ * camembert normand * ] ( http://www.normandie-actu.fr/files/2016/03/camembert-commons-wikimedia.jpg ) is the way to repentance .
