chill man ... 
  this video is a running joke here , it 's not seen as something serious but everytime the topic is brought somebody will say it as a joke . 
  bonus point if you manage to do the same accent . 
  you do realize that events of such magnitude influence the society over generations right ? 
  our grandparents have lived this and trust me lots of us have some families stories about how it was . 
  sure we did n't experience it first hand but it 's in our `` common memory '' , my grandpa told me some stuff about it , how it was to wake up with ice on your visage because you had nothing to warm yourself up , how kids were given a glass of wine at school when they had difficulties to eat , how his cousin have been deported , how his aunt had the habit to take off the walls nazi 's propaganda posters and how the first thing he have done after the war when products were not restricted anymore was to eat butter with a spoon because he missed it . 
  we do n't understand it fully , no , but we do have an idea thanks to our grandparents . 
  typical rosbeef 's inferioty complex , nothing to see here charles . 
  caf\u00e9 ? 
   shall we take the whole country off your hands as it 's obviously too much for you to handle . 
  ok then justified sorry . 
  do i have to open my mouth so you can piss in it aswell ? 
  finally someone who understand !, 
  sure , france will go full north korea for you . 
  damn it . 
  1er d\u00e9cembre 1990 : [ england and france are finally linked under the sea ] ( http://www.franceinfo.fr/sites/default/files/2014/05/04/1406985/images/principale/jonction%20du%20tunnel%20sous%20la%20manche%20-%20photo%20cr%c3%a9dit%20eurotunnel.jpg ), 
  of course !, 
  sorry if i 'm late but you seem curious so i have digged into our civil code  . 
  you can launch an `` action de d\u00e9saveu de paternit\u00e9 '' ( rejection of paternity ) . 
  you have a limited time to do it ( and all the situations are imagined so you 'll excuse me if i do n't translate them haha but you basically have 2 years after the majority of the child or if you provided financial to the child after a separation , you have 2 years after the cessation of the alimony to give you an idea ) and you have to provide enough pieces of evidence to convince the judge that a paternity test is required . 
  you expect me to not smoke with my caf\u00e9 ? 
  you fool !, 
  more seriously , it 's not forbidden on terraces or bus stops , so that 's why we do it haha . 
  basically you ca n't smoke inside ( unless it 's in a designated area who is ventilated , a `` fumoir '' ) , in the public transports and in the lyc\u00e9e / coll\u00e8ge / whatever places who provide training or accommodation for minors but you can smoke everywhere if it 's an open area . 
  on a more serious note , if you really ca n't support the smell of smoke , you can always ask . 
  i do n't smoke where there are childrens near me and if you ask me nicely at the bus stop , i 'll move a little further , basic civility i guess but i 'm not everyone and some people are assholes so ... 
  what a surprise ... and what a disgrace ... 
  ^ one ^ more, 
  3 cases when it 's legal : * a judge think it 's necessary ( for any context , heritage , filiation , whatever ) and order it . 
  * medical research . 
  * when we need to identify a dead guy . 
  as i said in another comment , i 'm actually surprised the reason gave to this restriction in the filiation context is in part about preserving the well-being of the family after all the jazz we made with the same-sex mariage and how our minister of justice said we need to be progressist ... 
  ok then . 
  the `` int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de la famille '' part seems indeed out of place . 
  the more you know i guess , i 'm actually pretty surprised by this . 
  our legislators really missed a chance to launch a manif pour tous 2.0 :d . thank you . 
  edit : the part about the concept of filiation in france is really interesting . 
  even if i agree with this concept , i 'm not sure i agree with the way it is used in this context and to be honest , i expected taubira to be more progressive ... 
  my mistake sorry , forget to do basic checking and it seems that indeed , [ we divorce less than our fellow americans ( nuptialit\u00e9 et divortialit\u00e9 dans l'union europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 27 ) ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=t10f032 ) , my apologies again , lesson learned i hope :d . anyway , i do n't say that the restriction is ok or anything , i do n't really have a stance about that , i just say that i do n't buy the `` keeping families together '' stuff , especially if just before saying that you say it 's because we are allegedly more unfaithful , it 's just an old clich\u00e9 we see over and over again who came right from a novel of maupassant , it 's a nice read but far from the reality imo . 
  i just gave that guy the legal restriction of paternity test in our country so he can advance more tangible arguments like yours the next time instead of being a moron in case he 's really interested in the legality of paternity tests across the world ... 
  to contest paternity in a legal context you have to go trough a judge anyway unless in others countries you just have to go to the town hall with your sheet of paper and say `` not my son , bye '' but i doubt it . 
  if the judge have reasons to think that the filiation is unclear , he will order a paternity test . 
  i do n't really think that the reason is to `` keeping families together '' , we just love to give legal restrictration to a lots of things ... ~ ~ and [ 10 married out of 1000 couples divorced in 2012 ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=bilandemo8 ) according to the insee when in the us it 's [ 3,4 ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage_divorce_tables.htm ) . 
  talk about `` keeping families together '' , i know that our society are different and we value the marriage differently but when it comes to `` keeping families together '' , i really have the impression that in france we are more open to divorce than a lot of other countries . ~ ~, 
  french are unfaithful and right after the commercial break , learn all about the non-go zones in paris , follow our reporter imamericanandilovetotalkoutofmyasslel in the center of radical islamism in [ yurop ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/02/article-2093986-118fcb02000005dc-360_634x286.jpg ) !, 
  but first we are going to talk to our specialist mr.neckbeard mcidiot ( he 's 1/16 irish ) who will explain how america , land of freedom and burgers won the crusades !, 
  haaaa , clich\u00e9 are fun , right ? 
  love it !, 
  i have to go , i have to cheat on my gf while she fucks her boss hon hon hon. 
  his ass ? 
  kek . 
  [ anyway , if you are really interested by this matter ... ] ( http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do;jsessionid=6543efbbd59e57bca77b22375a47df41.tpdila22v_2?cidtexte=legitext000006070721&amp;idarticle=legiarti000023711923&amp;datetexte=20150723&amp;categorielien=id#legiarti000023711923 ), 
  * * le chant du monde * by giono . 
  i love giono works but this novel is just incredible . 
  * * la condition humaine * by malraux . 
  talks about the massacre of sanghai , this guy just knew how to write . 
  * * barrage contre le pacifique * by duras . 
  i know it 's bad but i do n't really read recent litterature , i should correct that ... 
  it 's in renovation and it will be finished in 2016 iirc . 
  and the photos showed are these of the worst and oldest building of the prison ( built in 39 ) , but yes , les baumettes are known for being a shithole . 
  i remember a story i have read in the local newspaper about a guy who had a permission and he did n't come back ... days later , he surrendered to the police saying that all he wants is not being incarcerated in marseille . 
  even if les baumettes are an extreme , no one in their right mind pretends that the conditions of our prisons are good . 
  and the contr\u00f4leur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des lieux de privation de libert\u00e9 regulalry say that our prisons are in a shitty state so i think that everybody in this country know the state of our prisons , thank you . 
  so not willing to be an `` us colony '' ( i 'm not sure if the word colony is appropriate for what you have in mind ) is being arrogant ... well , i guess i do n't mind the old clich\u00e9 `` french are arrogant '' in that case . 
  the french newspaper was the sole source of reliable info at the time he made the sticky ... english newspaper were saying bullshit just for the sake of saying something about the attack ... everybody just overreacted for a '' \u00e9 '' and the word `` attentat '' : / . 
  but reddit loves drama , so the shitstorm was mandatory i suppose . 
  en utilisant le google traducteur : you think i 'm going to subject myself to an old queen who was beheaded for a long time if you had a semblance of respect for yourself ? 
  anyway , you are faint of heart , if you land in calais , you will flee at the sight of all these immigrants . 
  i expect you to firm up . 
  as a french , the `` calais is british territory '' part almost killed me , do n't say things like that , it 's bad for my heart . 
  that 's how you get a hundred years ' war . 
  haha . 
  i 'm just tired by this i suppose . 
  i 'm usually good to detect the sarcasm but sometimes my radar fail me :( . 
  sorry for being a little agressive , the spirit of the 14 juillet is still in the air :d . anyway , i think that my comment reflect how many of us think about the crisis in calais and in europe in general . 
  there is no easy solutions , and reading day after day what france have to do to solve the problem in 2 minutes is a little infuriating . 
  you ca n't really blame us for being lazy and selfish ... everybody in this fucking world is being lazy and selfish . 
  do n't be selfish , take some of these migrants !, 
  anyway , sooner or later this shitty situation will get attention from the media , and as always , our politics will decide to do something when this will be on tv . 
  right now , they have no interest in doing so . 
  and you can try to fine us ( but first you have to sign a treaty with us or some shit , you ca n't fine us like that i believe ) but we do n't have the reputation to pay our fines :d . the thing is , the immigration flow get stopped in calais and migrants accumulate here and the problem seems really difficult to solve . 
  you are lucky , you are on the good side of the channel , let us deal with the shit when you drink your thea but honestly , everytime i read some english people saying how `` selfish '' , `` lazy '' or `` incompetent '' we are , in my head i just say `` well , fuck 'em . 
  these people want to go to england ? 
  the ship is on me , let 's go boys ! '' . 
  we have the tough job here . 
  not you . 
  you do n't hear us bitching all day long about all the shit we have at the italian border ( http://www.lemonde.fr/immigration-et-diversite/article/2015/06/19/a-la-frontiere-franco-italienne-l-incessant-va-et-vient-des-migrants-refoules_4658294_1654200.html ) . 
  we do n't rant about how lazy and selfish the italians are when they are in a more difficult situation than us . 
  try to do the same , you 'll seem less selfish . 
  why not ? 
  so we can settle that for a century or two !, 
  i do n't know much about the situation in calais but uk having a military presence here is never going to happen , there is no way that france accepts that , rightfully so . 
  so if you want to `` suggest '' something on reddit , suggest something that is doable . 
   the uk needs to have a military presence in calais . 
  sure . 
  anything else ? 
  that 's where the fun is , some people said `` dclauzel only post french newspaper blablabla french agenda to take the world '' when they were the only good source of infos when english news site were writing bullshit about the location of the attack because they did n't have a clue ... and people are still bitching about it 2 weeks later , that 's really mindblowing ... 
  and it will take decades . 
  yes it will fuck you and yes you do n't even spend 2 % of your gdp on education put trust me , it 's for your own good and future . 
  you seems idiotic by writing that but i 'll respond .
