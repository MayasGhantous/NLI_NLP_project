cries in french . 
  why are you insulting your own country ? 
  you 're not even italian !, 
  that 's what i just described . 
  flair checks out . 
  nice try but the franks are a germanic people , so ** you ** started it against yourself . 
  even charles de gaulle spoke a foreign language he spoke german , yet he was one of the best presidents we ever had . 
  so m\u00e9lenchon and hamon are conservative to you ? 
  i qas calling you out because you said that ** all ** french candidates were conservative while we have three far-left candidates . 
  ca n't disagree with you here but / r/france is kind of the same with the m\u00e9lenchon circlejerk . 
  you think it 's a bad thing for our presidents to speak foreign languages ? 
  you do too mate . 
  we have 3 far-left candidates . 
  how is that conservative ? 
  they ** will ** cry . 
  the only thing i 'm sure about in this election is that le pen will lose , but if you 're for macron , m\u00e9lenchon is bad news since they will be much closer, 
  m\u00e9lenchon taking down le pen would be a really bad thing for macron . 
  my bad third biggest colonial empire after the british and spanish one and sixth biggest empire in history , i probably said that france was the second biggest empire because in the second half xviiith france had a bigger and more powerful empire than spain ( wich was already largely weakened at this point . ), 
  and was second only to the british one . 
  france had the second biggest colonial empire in the world , there 's nothing to argue there . 
  i can see why people do n't want to lose their time with you . 
  also you laugh at people who have no arguments but you 're not much better yourself :  nah , but nice try . 
  and ? 
  at least the colors are right . 
  you wo n't be running much once your island will be underwater . 
  this thread is n't about the uk mate ... 
  she is indeed a crazy bitch . 
  jesus christ next time people are going to say that napoleon was a martian . 
  you know that water is wet , right ? 
  yes all religion besides islam are completely innocent . 
  islam is complete shit but other religions are not completely innocent . 
  are you gon na to say that to every person on this thread ? 
  just create a bot mate . 
  good . 
  nationalists against nationalists . 
  ca n't deny that . 
  they are n't colonies . 
  russia has made the right choice . 
  i agree fillon must be stopped . 
   center of nazism how does he know that ? 
  does erdogan have a nazi-radar ? 
  really ? 
  just you . 
  will this never end ? 
  that 's cute . 
  yeah we just had our most warmongering president since de gaulle but yeah `` contemporary french foreign policy is based on weakness and capitulation '' yeah totally . 
  so one brit is changing the opinion of that sub all by himself ? 
  you sweet sweet summer-child . 
  deal !, 
  we only want wallonia do n't worry . 
  yes , yes it 's british calm down , the spanish are not going to turn you into jam\u00f3n while you sleep . 
  also that 's a big fucking rock . 
  my guess is that they already did , in a parallel universe where nigel farage is president of the united states of europe . 
  god forbid the eu brings european countries closer to eachother . 
  i have trust in my people , they wo n't vote for a corrupt piece of shit . 
  fucking lol mate , le pen 1st fillon 2nd , yeah and de gaulle is going to rise out of his grave . 
  i agree christianity is wayyy better than islam in this regard but there still is some misoginy to a degree . 
  but it 's not a national motto . 
  now that you ca n't create a croissant war with the spanish on / r/place anymore , you get back to the pictures of france ? 
  i feel this way too unfortunately , the future does not look bright . 
  this is horrible . 
  stay strong russians !, 
  they 'll go to europa ( the moon ) . 
  * the bosk cauntree, 
  ** `` they 're turning the frickin ' brits gay !, 
  thank you so much . 
  you 're a hero . 
  i like that . 
  i do n't particularly like the uk but elizabeth ii seems chill . 
  there a coordinated effort , we 're moving north and we want to put a cross of lorraine . 
   / r/europe still contains non-eu members . 
  of course but the eu is a very important thing about europe , it 's obvious we 're going to talk about the eu on this sub . 
   i have n't seen really any hazing of norwegians or swiss for not being in the eu during the time i 've been subscribed here . 
  that 's because they 've never been in the eu . 
  maybe people find the uk a little bit `` traitorous '' even though they should n't feel that way about the uk , the uk was interested about an economic union not a political one and the uk fully had a right to leave the eu . 
  and of course everyone saying : `` lol elsass ist germon lololol '' . 
  jesus fucking christ that joke is tiresome ... 
   oh i 'm fine with calling english a peasant language . 
  but we 're all speaking it , not just me . 
  that 's the thing his comment was sarcastic . 
   i 've been subscribed to / r/europe for at least three years now you 're telling me you 've been subscribed to / r/europe for three years and did not realise that this sub is pro-eu . 
   they want to leave the eu , who cares ? 
  europeans . 
  aka most of the people who browse eu . 
   europe is a geographic entity . 
  it is also for the most part a political one represented by the eu . 
  in my opinion should be both a geographhic entity and a political one . 
  of course people are going to talk about the brexit and the eu in / r/europe they both concern europe . 
  it 's banter mate , calm the fuck down . 
  do n't you think it 's ironic saying english is a peasant language while speaking english ? 
  i hope so . 
  the fuck ? 
   we are definitely democrats and ** reject chauvinistic ideas . 
  ** right . 
  to be fair he does not look as insane as some polish users in this sub says he is . 
  but i can see how the current polish government is a problem in the eu . 
  god damn those immigrants !, 
  even when we get rid of them , they still manage to cost us money !, 
  you 're syrian mate . 
  why the fuck do you want le pen ?
