  because there are dumbasses that really believe this shit , it 's a shitty joke that became popular in 2003 because the us were about ` france not coming to the fuckfest held in irak , it 's an incredibly unoriginal joke that has been told a quadrillion time , there are loads of ways to make good and subtle jokes at france ans this is not one of them . 
  the only type that this can make are dumbasses knowing nothing about french or englishmans with giant inferiority complexes . 
  this `` joke '' is garbage .

  england took the nazis on their own ? 
  let me laugh , england was scared shitless of germany , you guys waited on your island for four years for the big guys to save you . 
  without the usa and the ussr you would have been defeated by the nazis . 
  and while we 're talking about sucking dicks i can tell you 're very good at swallowing . 
  silly , gramps was n't taking down vichy france he was too busy being a corpse under a pile of rubble in london , when he finished thanking god there was a channel between him and the germans .
