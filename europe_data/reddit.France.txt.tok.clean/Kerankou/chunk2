  social unrest . 
  huge manifestations . 
  not enough police , not enough border control , huge immigration coming from the neighbour countries ( 35 % of the population is foreign ) , huge population boom , crime rates 4 times higher than metropolitan france , unemployment , lack of hospitals , life is more expensive than it is in metropolitan france , infrastructure problems , water distribution is n't optimal . 
  tl ; dr : the population feels and is abandonned by the government . 
  do you know remi fraise ? 
  the french police killed him . 
  his death sparked riots all over france , yet he was a white frenchman . 
  so farage is a good politician because he `` trigurd leftists ! '', 
  holy shit . 
  i misread . 
  i read national socialist instead of national capitalist . 
  so you 're a monarchist ? 
  there 's a sub dedicated for those questions . 
  like the good ol' days my friend . 
  how surprising . 
  is n't that the case for every country in the world ? 
  would 've been fun to know the reaction of the architect . 
  `` how can i turn this discussion into shitty identity politics ? '', 
  i think the sub is just being honest with itself now . 
  everybody knows that / r/europe is a pro-eu subreddit . 
  meme magics knows no bound and no borders . 
  we shall revive the romeme empire !, 
  execute article 69 ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i love protests . 
  especially the kind with dinosaurs in it !, 
  nice aliteration . 
  there are also protests in vladivostok . 
  i never pre-order my games , i just got hit by the hype train for both of those , and i bought acu because i found that ac black flag was really good . 
   i 'm not a citizen of spain , just resident thank god , i knew the spaniards are n't retarded . 
  maybe he thought they were real news but when he understood that they were fake news !!!, 
  wait till gas selling companies hear about this ... 
  i hate myself for buying watch dogs and ac unity , but i hate myself even more for buying no man 's sky . 
  there 's always a party pooper ... 
  username does n't ckecks out at all , the flair on the other hand ... 
  the swiss and turkish flags have the same colors , we might see them burning their own flag . 
  look deeper in the thread in this thread , there 's already one of those ... 
  well at least you are n't right in the middle of it . 
  the official anthem of the anglosphere : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pfynvdl0qcw, 
   well i guess i 'm gon na choose to be a black guy from now on . 
  how you doin ' homie ? 
  in other words we 're the best at not speaking english . 
  look at all this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ non-existent freedom !, 
  it 's cringe , but at least it 's european cringe . 
  what in the actual fuck . 
  more like england is a region of normandy . 
  that 's because there is no `` french '' cider , there is only breton and norman cider . 
  and both are pretty damn good , but they 're uncommon outside of french borders . 
  turkey ranks higher in my esteem now . 
  france also produces cider , but only two regions produce a high quantity of it : brittany and normandy . 
  needs more jpeg, 
  the french one is weird , i mean we have the most powerful army in the eu now that the uk is gone , abd we have an independent nuclear defence system . 
  unless this comic is taking the traditional ( and stupid ) france = dae white flag , very le funny , route . 
  but that does n't make sense , since quatar is inhabited by muslims should n't it be a poor country ? 
  yes that quatar . 
  i know quatar is a shitstain on this world but answer my question : is quatar a rich country ? 
  muslims = poverty . 
  many things can be said about muslims , but muslims equaling poverty is a pretty stupid thing to say . 
  have you heard of a place named quatar ? 
  how do you masturbate with a banjo ? 
   how to argue on t_d : maga maga maga you forgot : `` cuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckccuckcuckcuckc !!!!!!!!! '', 
  no please do n't start this trend again !, 
  not another `` europe according to x '' pleaaase !, 
  i know that . 
  the why i said `` the overseas regions ** and ** corsica '' as to differentiate the two . 
  where are the overseas regions and corsica ? 
   the french judging by your flair , you 're probably one of us mate . 
   after the queen 's speech , we all then proceed to fart the national anthem . 
  in wich direction ? 
  fichues officines qui ourdissent !, 
  i do n't think even you guys are mad enough to eat brussels sprouts . 
  `` we 're collectively farting in brussels direction '' could be a good one . 
  the two are n't related , new-caledonia is n't possibly leaving because we gained mayotte . 
  both . 
  that 's because he is one , except he 's far-left instead of being far-right . 
   europe  communist pick one . 
  why ? 
  hollande is not even the lowest one !, 
  come on austria !, 
  well according to this poll there is still 44 % of the scottish people that wants independence . 
  aw come on , a good march and you 'll be in paris in no time !, 
  yeah , never went there though . 
  well to be fair the rulers of england at that time were french . 
  * jeanne i assume that 's what you were trying to go for . 
  why through belgium ? 
  why not through alsace-lorraine it has a beautiful countryside , we both know that . 
  the french basque country is also a popular tourist destination , it 's one of the best surf spots in france . 
  proves my point further , it does n't matter what scottish people are thinking about now , it 's what they 'll be thinking about in 2020 or 2021 that will matter, 
  says nicola sturgeon and the british state . 
  well the refenredum will be in 2018 or 2019 , so it does n't really matter . 
  well it can still trade with the uk while being independent . 
  welp too bad , cause now alsace is french , and it will stay that way . 
  your sentence is correct except for the word `` foulle '' ' that word does n't exist . 
  and another nice argument . 
  i bet you 're a really intelligent and sensible person . 
  that 's a really nice argument you got there . 
  let me guess , you would choose trumpland ? 
  yeah , sweden has problems with its migrant population but calling them cucks and saying that sweden is a hellhole will not help resolve the problem . 
  22 is wilders . 
  was n't there a massacre made by a guy in a batman costume during a viewing of the dark knight ?
