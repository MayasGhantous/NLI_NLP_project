  eurocentrism in a sub named / r/europe ? 
  who would have thought ? 
  next you 're gon na tell me they speak about canada in / r/canada, 
   dump holes  better safer life you contradict yourself in the same fucking sentence . 
  christ you 're stupid . 
  by the way in what language are you speaking right now ? 
  o h yeah the west such powerless wimps , most people on earth are talking a western language and ingented 90 % of the world 's inventions . 
  i see jealousy in your comments . 
  trump will lose . 
  a lot of people make pretty big assumptions concerning politics , generally they do n't like what happens next . 
  almost 50 % , the police is usually very right-wing in france . 
  eh fair enough , french and uk military are pretty much on par . 
  ( even if all that does n't matter in the end since we both have nukes . ), 
  a big portion of the french electorate would rather die than see her elected . 
  if you really were being realistic you would say that fillon or macron could be the next president of france . 
  anyone ( except m\u00e9lenchon ) who will face her in the second round will have a huge boost . 
  it already happened back in 2002 , and it 's not because brexit and trump happened that le pen `` must '' win . 
  wishful thinking . 
  you 're right they come to steal the oil . 
  what other comment ? 
  and nobody except islamists want more terror attacks !, 
  the fuck you 're talking about ? 
  wishful thinking . 
  entirely ? 
  oh yes , they did n't talk about economy at all during brexit . 
  oh yes irak , i 'm sure they love america , it 's not like the us completely fucked their country over for greed , oh yes please got to irak and tell irakis that you 're american , i 'm sure they 'll love you . 
  oh yes trump the buisness genuis , his biggest success in all of his career was to inherit from his father . 
  oh and also the guy almost bankrupted his company four times . 
  oh , but why am i not surprised to read that a complete moron like you voted for trump ? 
  even your beloved orangepresident is saying it `` make america great again '' keywords : great again . 
  but you 're right if i were an american i would n't that much about europe , until we achieve greater unity . 
  i would worry about china , might want to go study mandarin , just a thought ... 
  yeah , sweden , pakistan ... same thing right ? 
  you have good public transport service . 
  ** e ** ** n ** ** e ** ** m ** ** y ** ** o ** ** f ** ** t ** ** h ** ** e ** ** p ** ** e ** ** o ** ** p ** ** l ** ** e **, 
  nobody in this sub wants terrorist attacks to happen more often . 
  they 're downvoting your comment because you qualified nice as being `` extremely dangerous '' just because it had one terrorist attack . 
  the fuck you 're smoking ? 
  good . 
  would you like it with a side of freedom fries and some freedom cabbage ? 
  it 's not because it had a terrorist attack oncee that it became extremely dangerous , when people think about new york or madrid they do n't think about danger , yet those two had terrorist attacks far more murderous than nice . 
  do n't forget that t_d ** is ** a joke . 
  i do n't know why you 're being downvoted . 
  as everyone does . 
  i approve , auld alliance and ale !, 
  fake news , fake jobs , fake promises , lots of fake things with populists . 
  is every american orange ? 
  * b\u00fbcher, 
  sometimes the brits just seem obssessed about us . 
  yeah he needs to take a brest . 
  maybe obama was a bit narcissistic when he was in power ( who would n't be ? 
  he was the most powerful person on the planet ) but trump is extremely narcissistic , and he always already like that long before he was in power . 
  neither does guadeloupe or martinique or mayotte . 
  do n't forget animu . 
  `` while you were smoking joints in amesterdam i studied the blade . '', 
  oh yes sweet , sweet , superior european craftmanship . 
  and le pen !, 
  why do we always end up around lousiana ? 
  `` colonization '' . 
  what are you doing to our 96th d\u00e9partement ? 
  [ i blame the english ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7ydv9ef-99i ), 
  germans are a total disaster !, 
  believe me !, 
  i 've seen goats smarter than farage !, 
  `` it 's true !, 
  believe him !, 
  i know / u/suberee , he always says : donald you 're great , you are very qualified to be the president of the usa , you 'll be the greatest president ! '', 
  it 's true ! '', 
  no you 're rigth but since the end of ww2 brittany is a socialist bastion . 
  / r/worldnews being complete shit ? 
  this is really unexpected . 
  `` such politician . 
  much canadian . 
  wow . '', 
  eh , i do n't know trump is still adamant about his wall . 
  * bretons , briton is for british people . 
  eh , not the primal reason , brittany has always been a bastion of the left . 
  this is a case of wether it 's the demand or the offer . 
  i think it 's the offer you think it 's the demand , except you conider your opinion as a fact . 
  the usa is the biggest power on this planet , the largest maker of movies , video games , music , entertainment . 
  it 's only logical that some of it goes outside of its borders . 
  it 's not because europe is fascinated by american culture and only consumes american culture . 
  america is influential on the geopolitical scale so is its culture . 
  you should know better about cultural exchange better , after all america is a cultural melting pot . 
  looks glorious . 
  your country exports its culture like crazy and then you 're surprised that the us has a bit of influence over europe ? 
  and i do n't think people are obssessed by the us . 
  and no the us is not `` omnipresent '' . 
  europe is not imitating the us , your country is throwing its culture in the face of everyone . 
  france : most arrogant : france . 
  you 're serious or ... ? 
  * mon ami , i 'm a guy , and a more acurate translation of `` mate '' would be `` pote '' or `` copain '' . 
  it 's a poll based on how people feel about these nations so it is n't about facts mate ... 
  [ dae white flag of france xd xd , dae french tanks go in reverse :d :d xd xd xd , dae french surrender !,

  do the people wanting the eu to disappear not realize that the eu is extremely convenient ?
