  oh god please no . 
  do n't forget the tequila . 
  eh most old bunkers in france are rotting away , disapearing under the sand/dirt and riddled with ugly tags . 
  no because your taxes have nothing to do with an old breton fort . 
  stop saying bullshit . 
  well most right-wing french politicians have a hard-on for de gaulle . 
  oh look a funny ^ ^ ^ tm and original ^ ^ ^ tm joke . 
  did you meant `` the french military has never wanted recruits ? 
  because they do recruit . 
  they do n't want to rejoin us , they want to be independent .

  when they make a law you whine , when they abolish a law you whine , will you guys ever stop whining ?

  and why is paris a shithole and more dangerous than any place in the third world ? 
   no one mentioned the rest of france . 
  except the comment you responded to . 
  / u/jl830 mentioned france wich includes paris and `` the rest '' . 
  yes , yes , you read 1984 5 days ago we get it . 
  weeds ? 
  it 's like internet brown shirts . 
  i have never ate frog legs , but apparently it 's mix between fish and chicken . 
  probably because buzzfeed is mostly shit . 
  they have a vision of their country , except this vision is from 50 years ago . 
  and we all know that paris = all of france ? 
  right ? 
  oh poor little sob . 
  the french secret service have bigger fish to fry . 
   we 're too mean/racist . 
  only for germany , i think french and italian borders , look a lot more even . 
  do you know the real reason why france wanted alsace-lorraine so much ? 
  because it produces the best german salt . 
  what is this heresy . 
   yes , let 's now do a contest who kisses putin 's ass faster and with more passion . 
  it will be really close , i bet on le pen , but trump is really good too . 
  they have the best citruses . 
  the people 's democratic republic of best korea to be precise , you would n't want godly leader kim jong-un , to smite you with his divine powers , do you ? 
  the problem is there are no french on / r/le _ pen . 
  muh colonialism !, 
  stop whining a out the past and grow a pair , i 'm not responsible for what my elders have done . 
  username checks out, 
  also with paris . 
  even in poland ? 
  but you guys are the most religious country in europe , you even elected big ol' j as your king . 
  i 'm really surprised . 
  the one with trump swearing allegiance is absolutely amazing . 
  seems like only south africa can beat us ... 
  wait a second , he read 1984 and thought : `` oh what a wonderful world to live in . '', 
  this man can not be for real . 
  incest = wincest ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  yes fellow french citizens , we have stood against the trump wave and won !, 
  also one of the best shows on french television . 
  that 's debatable . 
  clinton was n't much better than trump . 
  i like the adieu . 
  ftfy . 
  the guy you responded to mispelled the name she 's actually called [ `` marion-mar\u00e9chal le pen '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/marion_mar\u00e9chal-le_pen ) . 
  you 'll have problems if you say that in russia ...

  are you mocking the powerful and majestic country of san escobar !? 
  can we pay you in escopesos ? 
  the oficial money of san escobar ? 
  the first ooma-loompah president of the united states of america .

  [ i hate iceland !,

  how is that confusing ? 
  sopething can be from two cultures at a time . 
  saying tri martolod is traditional french music overlooking the fact it 's not just that . 
  yes and no . 
  corsica is part of france . 
  but corsica has its own culture , just like brittany . 
  it ' both . 
  yeah but it does n't have the same culture , france is not one big culture . 
  the big clue that might indicate the tri martolod is n't traditional french music is that it is n't spoken in french . 
  breton traditional music . 
  subtle enough so that most people do n't realise it 's propaganda . 
  but still kinds of brainwash them . 
  well if you do n't like the word refugee , you can use migrant , because they do migrate no one can deny that . 
   yes i 'm kind of ashamed of my own countrymen here , sadly that 's the power of `` light '' propaganda . 
  [ they took our jobs !, 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rutnnkhf-eu ), 
   tri martolod that 's not french music buddy . 
  a good movie !? 
  the fuck mate , it 's complete shit !, 
  not it 's the fact that they steal money , resources , use their childs as thieves , pollute , make no efforts to integrate into modern society and look down on romas that do try , do not educate their kids while school is free and romanians suffers from romas because a big amount of people thinks all romanians are romas , and because of this romanians are afflicted with extremely negative stereotypes that they do n't deserve . 
  romas that do n't do anything to adapt to the societies they 're in do not deserve empathy . 
  trust me i 'm french i know this shit all too well . 
  crimes , stealings and trash everywhere they go . 
  so we 're governed by a royal ? 
  san escobar hmm ...
