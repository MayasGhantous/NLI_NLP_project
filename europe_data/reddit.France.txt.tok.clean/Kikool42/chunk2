  i have to say i 'm passionate about eastern europe too . 
  i 've been to poland and i really want to go back there and visit russia , czech , lithuania , ukraine , etc. 
  there 's something there that really got me . 
  perhaps it 's the women . 
  * what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  too many posts about immigration , too many shit news , too many trolls or inside jokes from reddit , not enough cultural exchanges , not enough stuff about culture ( like literature , music , architecture , and so on ) . 
  seriously / r/europe is almost only politics . 
  you really need to put more cultural stuff into it . 
  * do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  yes i do !, 
  i was a moderator at / r/karmacourt ( about 50k subscribers ) , and i moderate smaller subs as well . 
  * why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  because i want to show people not every french guy is like / u/dclauzel . 
  some of us can speak english for real and can be smart enough to moderate this sub and turn it into something nice with good content . 
  * why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i 'm direct , i apply myself and i have a good judgement . 
  i 'll be neutral and i can garantee you my opinions are always right . 
  and if i 'm wrong , then i 'm right to be wrong . 
  * do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  datamining yes , statistics too ( r , cross tabs , etc ) . 
  * what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  one thread about immigration once in a while is good . 
  but do n't feed the people who do n't know shit about politics and have limited point of views . 
  overall that place just seemed like a way to vent about immigrants . 
  * what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i 'm too direct . 
  i wo n't shut up and listen . 
  i 'll say what i think about such or such . 
  this is what cost me my position at / r/karmacourt . 
  * would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  a horse sized duck ? 
  ducks big like horses ? 
  are you sponsored by mosanto or what ? 
  * what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why tatcher . 
  seems pretty obvious to me . 
  ~ ~ shots ~ ~ croissants fired . 
   we will shortly be recruiting a substantial number of new mods . 
  for fucks sake please make sure you choose people ** who know how to speak english . 
  ** we do n't care about where he 's from . 
  just pick someone who can speak and write proper english and not look like a failure by using google translate or his or her own language to translate in english . 
  it 's anything but credible ( and very annoying ) . 
  you 're moderators . 
  you 're all supposed to be able to express yourselves well enough to the community . 
  so please for the love of all that 's worthy on reddit pick someone who speaks well english . 
  i remember when i was there two years ago the asphalt literally melted under the sun at some places . 
  d\u00e9testeront * com ` on dude . 
  before poland it was called the grand duchy of warsaw . 
  then you had the lithuanian-polish commonwealth and then poland after 1945 . 
  calm down fishface . 
  ~ ~ shots fired ~ ~ war declared, 
  i went to poland . 
  do it . 
  it 's fucking awesome . 
  warsaw and krakow are impressive as fuck and it 's beautiful . 
  despite the stereotypes , it 's a beautiful country that 's not always that poor . 
  20/10 i would come back again . 
  honestly i 'm disappointed . 
  i was expecting to see an nice album about france and what to visit ( like the one on bulgaria and slovenia ) . 
  it 's funny , but i expected something else . 
  as a french this annoys me . 
  keep your poor racism to yourself . 
  they would make another world war . 
  no we need better police and better law enforcement . 
  it 's cultural , it 's the way they think . 
  in france hollande is the guy who wants to be on all sides . 
  he wants to help the poor and the companies at the same time , he wants to help the farmers and yet still have foreign products coming in , etc. 
  it 's a common saying to say he 's not left-side anymore but more of a guy who does n't know what he wants . 
  * facepalm *, 
  napoleon 's rise was much later . 
  we celebrate the rise indeed . 
  we 're very happy . 
  we make parties , fireworks , etc. 
  sure the events are not glorious but they managed to free us from the monarchy . 
  the us 's independence was n't glory too and still they celebrate it . 
  / u/dclauzel it 's your time to shine !!, 
  * i do n't know latin *, 
  re-read the thread . 
  lots of comments were made about his poor english . 
  you need more ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/3baic7/je_dois_dire_que_jappr%c3%a9cie_grandement_la_temp%c3%aate/ if you want me to translate the passages where it 's been said just ask me . 
  not too soon , too disgusting :( . 
  french here , i agree as well . 
  what i see here is that it 's only him . 
  he does it to help himself in english , not because of some nationalistic reasons . 
  we 're not like that ( at least i 'm not !, 
   i also fail to see why a non-english article is not `` proper '' . 
  that 's bad nationalism . 
  just give it in french . 
  people will translate if they want to . 
  i 'd rather have the article in a foreign language , look at the images , and look at it for 2 secs then being handed the google translate version . 
  in the academic world , and everywhere else , what matters is the source as such so people know you have one . 
  they 're not dumb , they 'll translate if they want to . 
  i have to agree with you unfortunately ... just keep in mind , he 's actually doing it because he ca n't speak english . 
  he needs french language to help him write english . 
  i 'm sure this is the real reason and unfortunately it 's making a very bad image of / r/france . 
  well it 's a good for cultural exchanges . 
  just so you know , the problem is n't the fact that he translates his comments but that his english is too poor . 
  that 's what we keep telling him on / r/france .
