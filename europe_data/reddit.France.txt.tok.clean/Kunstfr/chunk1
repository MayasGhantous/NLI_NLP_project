honestly it 's a really cool monument . 
  it 's huge and the area around is beautiful . 
  obviously it 's the most famous monument in the world so it is overrated , but it does deserve a lot of fame, 
  butter with everything . 
  he made a really good tv show recently where he travels and eats local food . 
  it 's really cool, 
  5-6 $ in france, 
  it 's like saying all swedish people live in wooden houses on lointains covered in snow, 
  if you 're ever in nantes go to the couche tard, 
  same even though they were unused in high school because you just stop bringing things, 
  well it 's not the most exciting life, 
  good, 
  i have n't seen the movie but bratislava is actually cheap , i had to take pictures when i saw 1 $ pints, 
  in brittany only : [ recent houses ] ( http://www.location-bretagne-tregastel.fr/img/album_maison.jpg ) , [ other example ] ( http://ws.pap.fr/cdnv1/5238a965b3d55c6883304bcb/5238a965b3d55c6883304bcb-1468829865.jpg ) [ older houses ] ( https://bretonbuild.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/facade-avant-renovation-guillac.jpg ) , [ other example ] ( https://maison-monde.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/chaumiere-bretonne-2.jpg ), 
  well i mean , most coms are usually considered as a full part of france . 
  french polynesia is the only exception really, 
   oh , yeah , his goal saved us . 
  come on , he kept faking fouls and insulted zidane . 
   i agree , the penalty to france was inexistent . 
  materazzi literally runs into malouda . 
  and as the french commenter says , `` yeah that 's materazzi who usually commits fouls '' . 
   he trained at juventus with buffon , he was our secret agent . 
  :(  [ totally ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoxrfu155m4&amp;ab_channel=jgv1 ) damn i did n't remember it to be that beautiful ... ca n't blame buffon on that one, 
  if you do n't count france , 11 : - belgium ( mostly brussels ) - netherlands ( amsterdam ) - germany ( only like one day in germany because we were going on a school trip to poland . 
  still cool , i want to go there now that i 'm older and can enjoy more things ! ), 
  - poland ( for a school trip , it made me realize how beautiful and cheap cities were , and how poor the countryside looked ... ) - czech republic ( prague , it was awesome . 
  one of my best experiences , meeting strangers , visiting a gorgeous city and partying like hell ) - austria ( lived for a while in vienna . 
  if i spoke german i 'd live there ) - slovakia ( bratislava , it was a cool visit to visit for one afternoon , left because there was n't much to do though ) - switzerland ( spent a couple summers accross the leman sea , it was nice . 
  not crazy though ) . 
  - spain ( a week living on a boat with 8 or 9 friends sailing accross the baleares was the best experience in my life , and i visited a couple border cities ) . 
  - uk ( jersey island when i was young , do n't really remember it ) - greece ( crete , it was a really cool vacation especially if you do n't go to the most touristic places and visit stuff like gramvoussa bay , which is pretty touristic , and eat in restaurants in the southern half of crete ), 
  why france ? 
  lol, 
  maybe next year ? 
   in spain though , they call the team `` la roja '' ( the red , for the uniform ) . 
  so nobody yells `` i support spain ! '', 
  but `` i support the red ! '', 
  otherwise poor catalans that would never cheer for `` spain '' , do n't have trouble rooting for `` the red '' . 
   in france , we are the blues ( les bleus ) . 
  you usually hear `` allez les bleus '' ( go blues ), 
  i still am too , 11 years later, 
  we were talking about food mate . 
  no need to shove your '' '' `` so-successful-integration '' '' '' in my face, 
  [ :'( ] ( https://youtu.be/ye-4709at8u?t=1m2s ), 
  worse final ever . 
  losing against portugal 10 years later in a shit game only makes it worse . 
  [ `` once in a lifetime experience '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany_at_the_fifa_world_cup#winning_world_cups ), 
  only [ casually explained ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucr3cbltymik9ky0f_odfwfq ) . 
  i used to watch a lot of english speaking channels but i 'm really tired of teir humor and stuff . 
  i watched all crash course history but that 's pretty much it, 
  and we strike a lot . 
  often it 's a good thing , sometimes it 's a bad thing . 
  really we ca n't touch anything without having thousands of people in the streets . 
  * cough * anglosphere * cough *, 
   apple pie i mean this exists pretty much anywhere . 
  there 's no proof your country invented apple pie . 
   the chicken balti from what i can find on the internet , it 's pretty much only an uk thing . 
   the chicken tikka masala nice !, 
   brown/hp sauce probably also only an uk thing , never heard of it  carbonated water carbonated drinks exist naturally and carbonated water was invented by frenchman [ gabriel fran\u00e7ois venel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabriel_fran%c3%a7ois_venel )  lasagne ( no , really ) [ the wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lasagne ) does n't mention the uk or england anywhere . 
   kitkats , chocolate bars yeah i guess . 
  not the best thing to invent though  quorn no idea what that is  the english breakfast i prefer french breakfasts , but i ca n't deny yours is good too !, 
  well his examples of good food in great britain are international food ... 
  not really . 
  they 're more accents nowadays ( which have some dialect influences ) but they 're all intelligible towards each other, 
  hmm big protests in france ... yeah there might have been a few, 
  yeah . 
  france is a terrible example on this issue, 
  he does n't mention the guy because he explained why . 
  stop accusing people of racism on no grounds, 
  yeah and also in school people that have a good accent are mocked . 
  it does n't help, 
  wine , saucisson and real bread . 
  by a landslide . 
  that 's the only thing stopping me from moving abroad really, 
  valls is more than born spanish on this issue , he 's born catalan, 
  yeah i guess they do but not 24/7 and for 4 times the price . 
  i mean there 's also alcohol delivery companies, 
  yeah i guess they do but not 24/7 and for 4 times the price . 
  i mean there 's also alcohol delivery companies, 
  yeah i guess they do but not 24/7 and for 4 times the price . 
  i mean there 's also alcohol delivery companies, 
  yeah i guess they do but not 24/7 and for 4 times the price . 
  i mean there 's also alcohol delivery companies, 
  yeah i guess they do but not 24/7 and for 4 times the price . 
  i mean there 's also alcohol delivery companies, 
  21067/km \u00b2 in paris . 
  135 hab/km \u00b2 in brittany , my region . 
  we have the massif armoricain , basically big hills/small mountains in the middle of the region , basically only the coast is inhabited, 
  you usually ca n't buy alcohol after 21h-00h depending on the city you live in . 
  of course after that you can just go to a bar or nightclub , they still sell alcohol . 
  no vending machines . 
  i 'm completely against 1 . 
  it 's worse when it 's people with power saying hate speech , but hate speech should never be seen as not important . 
  hate speech is idiotic and people have to understand that . 
  what 's the point of 2 ? 
  like why would you create a company if not for the money ? 
  how can a company develop without capital ? 
  3 is already here in france , and it 's definitely not a good idea . 
  these families are worth a ton of money without ever deserving it . 
  they basically just inherit what their ancestors built .
