  you guys are a better version of america where people even speak french . 
  thanks !, 
  that 's why i have n't bought a single ketchup bottle in my life, 
  ketchup is way sweeter ... 
  modern peugeots are alright . 
  208 , 308 , 508 are the ones i 've used recently and they 're really good for their respective markets, 
  watch some french series and movies and you 'll be alright , there 's nothing to be scared of . 
  you 'll quicly learn slang it 's not that complicated , but there 's too many i would n't know where to start, 
  no and i do n't feel any connection whatsoever with the catholic church, 
  liberal means economically liberal , like reagan and thatcher , so more right-wing . 
  conservative means socially conservative , like most right-wing parties here . 
  macron is a liberal but not a conservative . 
  le pen is a conservative but not a liberal . 
  i mean some workers want to explode their factory in another part of france , it 's not like we have the only idiots, 
  my dad got a 15 $ fine or something like that in germany, 
  i mean at least we could become a social democrat heaven while the rest of france would become far right, 
  yes theorically . 
  although they 're not going to make a ton of effort for a 10 $ fine, 
  you do n't work 7/7 . 
  the same could be said for the longer daylight on the summer , i have to work the next day so i 'm going to sleep at 11 pm anyway, 
  napol\u00e9on 's is awesome, 
  sounds normal to me , he 's just singing . 
  also , what the fuck , i 'm getting old , 200 million views for something i 've never heard before, 
  sunset at 3 pm sounds depressing to me . 
  are you depressed in the winter when you have only a few hours ? 
  you 're just used to it, 
  we call that pain de mie ( crumb bread ), 
  production engineer , 36k $ ( around 27k $ that i actually earn after taxes and everything ) . 
  or course americans earn more but they have to pay for healthcare , their tuition fees and so on . 
  also , paris has a lot of jobs in the service industry , but many industries have absolutely zero jobs there . 
  drugs are illegal police rather focuses on dealers , i 've never seen a police control after a techno music festival for instance . 
  you can still get punished though addicts have public phone numbers to get advice and heroin addicts can even have clean syringes , a safe place and medical help in a place in paris that recently opened . 
  [ marijuana is veeeeery very widespread . 
  ( marijuana consumption by country among adults ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/cannabis_use_among_adults_%28aged_15-64%29.svg/645px-cannabis_use_among_adults_%28aged_15-64%29.svg.png ), 
  and they are tasty, 
  as long as people still think in miles it 's still dumb, 
   brittany : all of them are bearded fishermen with strange names ending in - ec at least we 're not alcoholics for once, 
  `` bonjour do you speak english '' is already a try imo . 
  personally i learn how to say hi and thank you at the very least when i travel, 
  very common , but in a discrete way to make guys think they are n't wearing make up, 
  the peace and friendship . 
  not minor in the sense of not important but it feels like people do n't realize how far we 've come . 
  it really is underrated my dad had a penpal from germany come to brittany in the 70s . 
  many old but not too old people were insulting him behind his back and friends of my grandparents kept asking them why they would ever have a nazi in their house . 
  sidenote : he was from east germany apparently and when he came to a mall he thought they were tricking him because of how much stuff there was for sale, 
  well it also depends on whether you immediately speak english or if you at least say bonjour, 
  nope just like i have always done, 
  a lot . 
  i 've been in many places in most of metropolitan france aside from northern france and alsace, 
  yeah and also very high tuition fees make money, 
  i 've heard that you can get the stamps in tourist offices but yeah as you do n't need them you do n't ask for them, 
  nobody cares about her, 
  it 's just that rosbif is the french nickname for the english , and it also means roast beef . 
  we call them like we call the meat, 
  [ germany got a lot of hate in france ] ( https://youtu.be/wyvqz2tu43w?t=1m3s ) , schumacher being called a nazi by any french person who knows about this, 
  [ the chant des partisans , song of the resistance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suzwlf_vukg ) is already like a second national anthem here, 
  depends on where you live and if you have kids and wife/husband . 
  i 'd say having more than 1.8-2k $ / month after taxes is middle class ( a bit above the median salary ), 
  i have never seen a sikh, 
  [ typical handwriting is as such ] ( http://www.cafepedagogique.net/lesdossiers/publishingimages/2013/devanne-cp-1.1.jpg ) 2 . 
  with a dash 3 . 
  with an aslope and sometimes with [ another line ] ( http://www.profperso.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/diapositive034.jpg ), 
  more like 6 . 
  lidl, 
  her militants are far right militants though, 
  [ well it always does sound fancy ] ( https://youtu.be/j9gs-5cjak8 ), 
  nobody seems to care about it . 
  i mean none of my friends have even heard of it, 
  wtf 51 $ . 
  taxi ~ 15 $ , kebab 5 $ , 5 beers 30 $ and you have 50 $ . 
  your list would cost something like 130 $ here . 
  and not in the most expansive bars . 
  op listed savannah , georgia ... 
  [ apparently ] ( http://www.meteo-bretagne.fr/climatologie-records-rennes-st-jacques ) the coldest it has ever been in rennes was -19 \u00b0 c in 1929 and -17 \u00b0 c in 1940 . 
  the lowest average of the lowest temperatures was -5 \u00b0 c in february 1956, 
  [ the dragon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjafwki0olu ) is really cool too, 
  that 's just my region . 
  and honestly i feel like we keep seeing the same towns on reddit .

  we had 40 \u00b0 c for one day 2 years ago , now ** that ** was really hot . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen a temperature below -5 \u00b0 c though, 
  dying of sunstroke with 28 \u00b0 c ? 
  it starts being really hot around 32-33 imo, 
  we learn a bit about the history of religion though , but like from a historical point of view . 
  28 \u00b0 c sunny with a very slight wind . 
  france is one of the country where we smoke the most marijuana in europe and there 's literally a huge taboo against anyone who would dare speak in favor of its legalization . 
  [ this one ( in french ) ] ( http://www-dase.cea.fr/actu/dossiers_scientifiques/2002-09-30/index.html ) . 
  magnitude 5.5 at the center , it was around 3 where i lived . 
  saw my pencils move on my school table, 
  it exists in french too, 
  i 'd say android but iphones are very common still, 
  lol you just have n't eaten any good ones . 
  i have n't found any good kebabs in austria , it does n't mean there are n't any, 
  well we have [ one of the oldest buildings in the world ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/barnenez ) in my region . 
  in rennes i just love [ those ] ( https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrimoine_architectural_de_rennes#/media/fichier%3arennes6.jpg ), 
  big labour union demonstrations in most decently sized cities . 
  because you 're supposed to go to church in the morning i guess ? 
  well duh , they 're french, 
  they probably wanted to steal from you . 
  i 've seen food trucks mostly around universities during the workweek at lunchtime .
