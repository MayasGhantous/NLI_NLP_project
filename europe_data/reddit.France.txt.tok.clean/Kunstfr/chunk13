  how have i never met you ? 
  well yeah this was a poll right after euro 2016  nah , he might be more popular , but i do n't know , i feel like we do n't talk as much about him as we do about teddy riner, 
  probably [ teddy riner ] ( http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/var/plain_site/storage/images/judo/actualites/teddy-riner-un-an-d-invincibilite-de-plus-728832/18082343-2-fre-fr/teddy-riner-un-an-d-invincibilite-de-plus.jpg ) , he won 2 gold olympics medals and 8 world championship medals in judo ( +100 kg category ) . 
  the guy 's really cool and nice with journalists so he 's probably the most popular athlete, 
  are you looking for these deckchairs in particular ( which are apprently given by redbull to ski resort bars ) or just any deckchair ? 
  because deckchairs are available pretty much everywhere in france, 
  my head hurts, 
  well yeah i mean we see gauls as our ancestors even if that 's not that simple : vercing\u00e9torix is seen as someone who tried to protect gaul from the evil invaders . 
  then when frankish tribes settle in gaul , we consider them as our ancestors too . 
  it did n't work when i was in austria so i do n't think you can , sorry !, 
  138 $ per year ( 88 $ in overseas departments ) . 
  we also have an app here in france if you do n't own a tv : molotov , available on about everything which works alright . 
  a lot of people are sick of our presidential monarchy system where the president can do whatever je wants and is seen as the messiah for 5 years . 
  a lot of people , but apparently not a majority . 
  french people seem to love having one big leader . 
  i think a majority is in favor of a proportional representation in the parliement though , which is often suggested by candidates in favor of a 6th republic . 
  thought i had given it , it 's bistrot r\u00e9gent , sorry !, 
  there 's a smaller chain with a similar sauce and also all you can eat fries/saladbut with 5-6 types of meat ( duck , beef , tartare beef , salmon iirc ) , it 's better imo and has way shorter waiting lines, 
  same here . 
  it also depends on your working place , some have company restaurants , some go to restaurants where they 're regular , some eat together at work , some eat alone , etc, 
  a dating website only for high class jobs . 
  sounds great does n't it ? 
  we eat a ton of chocolate , often shaped as eggs or rabbits, 
  we do n't have any steps or date counting or anything . 
  when you 're meeting someone at that first date , you do whatever you want , kiss , have sex , do n't ... if you 're both drunk in a party , this can be the start of a relationship or not . 
  we 're very spontaneous . 
  we do n't have european wide dating websites . 
  on france there 's meetic , hugavenue , adopte un mec , \u00e9lite rencontres ( had to put that one , it 's litterally elite dating ), 
  illegal and something no politician can dare speak in favor of even though we 're probably the most cannabis smoking country in the eu, 
  wow thanks it actually sounds better than it looks, 
  wait i have no idea what kind of food this is, 
  we call it macedonia , like the country, 
  meh , it 's just frites where i live . 
  do n't worry , not everyone has such terrible tastes . 
  sparkling water is awesome, 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen one broken in france . 
  yeah he just means that you 're supposed to use a tiret - between voulez and vous as you 're supposed when inverting subject and verb in a question , like * allez-vous bien ? 
  here we mostly called the `` before '' `` pr\u00e9chauffe '' , litterally preheat, 
  yeah also in most germanic languages according to many overwatch players i 've talked with, 
  kunst was already taken so i used kunstfr . 
  i still use kunst when i can ( like on battle.net you can have same usernames with other people without being a problem ), 
  it 's west and mostly east from [ henri fr\u00e9ville ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/henri+fr%c3%a9ville/@48.0860677,-1.67556,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x480edfea98bd6523:0xee08144bba4eb27d!8m2!3d48.087648!4d-1.6747446 ) if you 're curious and want to check if there 's your country/region and goes on until [ la poterie ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/la+poterie/@48.0875003,-1.6467852,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x480edf733c129a59:0x2b9a4923e90decb8!8m2!3d48.0874967!4d-1.6445965 ), 
  `` god '' . 
  french people always expect the president to be some kind of messiah solving all problems in 5 years . 
  it 's not rough everywhere in brittany !, 
  brest is pretty rough while morbihan is honestly nice, 
  not if it 's explicitely a closed room for smokers , they 're usually ventilated but not enough . 
  clubs where you can smoke outside are the best, 
  so why allow it for children ? 
  it 's not illegal , but it 's often veeeeery crowded, 
  some bakeries have bread good enough that it 's absolutely not dry the next day . 
  i mean imo they 're the only third gen immigrants that still have flags and feel like citizens of their grandparents country , alongside with turkey and algeria . 
  when i failed my driver 's license test i had to wait 7 months here in france . 
  it 's better now but it used to be very long waiting times in some cities, 
  i do n't know if it 's similar in poland but on france we do that for kids as a sort of bike driver 's license . 
  absolutely not mandatory though, 
  what 's the problem with legislative bodies not being in the same building ? 
  it 's not 1800 anymore , they 're close and legislative bodies are n't always in the same building anyway, 
  well the strasbourg parliement looks better but yeah , apart from that i agree with you, 
  well we do n't thank the driver but just because you paid does n't mean you can be rude, 
  yeah maybe if it 's a small bus ( not an [ articulated one ] ( https://photo.via-mobilis.com/29/4/1185204-autobus-de_ligne.jpg ) and there 's not a lot of people i 'd do the same, 
  i mean it does seem a bit excessive to me , but it 's nothing shocking . 
  we just do n't eat the same things at all . 
  here in france you 'd find a bit of peanut butter ( really not that popular at all ) , a shitton of nutella ( ferrero 's or just other brands ) , many honey brands , many jams from nearly every fruit we eat here . 
  i 'm not sure we 'd find everything you listed, 
  everyone vs paris paris vs marseille everyone vs southwest ( chocolatine/pain au chocolat ) i 'm not gon na talk about every rivalry between cities , that would be way too long, 
  i ca n't even watch english versions with french subtitles anymore . . it 's just too different, 
  yeah they only have cultural differences, 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  i 've never been asked !, 
  same in france . 
  one of the highest ( if not the highest ) marijuana consuming western country and most politicians ca n't even open the debate of legalization without being sure to lose . 
  okay so i looked a bit into it , apparently the average cost in france is 13.000 $ . 
  so i guess 10 000 usd would be alright here . 
  and yeah i think colour schemes are a thing , but it 's also entirely possible to do weddings in another , cooler way . 
  like i know a girl who hates wearing dresses so she married in blue jeans . 
  that marriage did n't really care about colour schemes and everything . 
  from what i 've seen in american movies and tv series , the weddings seem very formal . 
  [ okay so i found this , do n't know how true this is ] ( http://policehommage.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_67.html ) . 
  so the last one is a heart attack and the one before is a car accident . 
  the last time on purpose was jean-baptiste salvaing and jessica schneider , both police officers murdered in their own home by larossi abballa in the name of isis . 
  only their son ( 3 years old ) was alive , larossi abballa was shot and killed during the raid on the house . 
  this was in june 2016, 
  i do n't think it 's big in france too . 
  i 've never heard of any catholic fasting . 
  lived there for a while , can confirm . 
  i just walked around the city without knowing where i was going and stumbled upon wonderful buildings such as the university , the museum for nature and art , the hofburg ... 
  the center of vienna is just beautiful . 
  and sch\u00f6nbrunn is so cool when you go on top of that hill behind and you see part of vienna . 
  looks really nice, 
  [ carnac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnac ) has more than [ 10.000 standing menhirs ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0e/b9/0f/0eb90fce444e1f05c964e2217753c534.jpg ) . 
  it 's 5000 years old and nobody really knows why our ancestors did that, 
  yeah i typed that comment too early in the morning, 
  not really . 
  maybe one of de gaulle , napol\u00e9on , louis xiv and charlemagne . 
  we do n't really have a father of the nation but those are the biggest heads of state we 've had, 
  not many . 
  there 's the parti chr\u00e9tien d\u00e9mocrate ( christian democrat party ) that does n't have a lot of support but often supports a candidate from the right wing party . 
  there 's the manif pour tous that is a anti gay marriage movement but it 's not really a party , they mostly support the right wing candidate .
