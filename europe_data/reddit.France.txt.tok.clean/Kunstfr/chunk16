  - epervier ( sparrowhawk ? ), 
  : one person is in the middle of a field , everyone else is on one side . 
  they have to run to the other side , while the sparrowhawk has to touch them . 
  every touched person becomes a sparrowhawk next round until there 's nobody left . 
  - poule renard vip\u00e8re ( chicken fox viper ) : okay so these are three teams . 
  each one has a base . 
  the chicken `` eat '' vipers , vipers `` eat '' foxes , foxes `` eat '' chicken . 
  every team has a base , and when you `` eat '' someone by touching him , you bring him to your base where they have to make a big line of people that have been eaten . 
  when someone from their team manages to touch one of his captured teammates in your base , they are all free until they 're captured again . 
  i 've always liked that game , it 's a bit defence and offence . 
  it requires a lot of players though . 
  - balle aux prisonniers/ballon prisonnier ( prisonners ball ) = dodgeball - chat ( cat . ), 
  = tag - cache-cache ( hide hide ) = hide and seek - bandiers contrebandiers ( weird because bandier is an old word for bandit , contrebandier is a smuggler , and it 's a play on words because contre is kinda like anti ... anyway ) = cops and robbers - un , deux , trois , soleil ( one , two , three , sun ) = [ game of statues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statues_ ( game \\ ) ) - gamelle : one person has a ball and has to look for those who are hiding . 
  the ball does n't move . 
  now , when you see someon , you have to touch the ball and say `` i 've seen you , jean-michel , hiding behind that tree !, 
  '' , thus capturing jean-michel who has to come wait near the ball . 
  the thing is , sometimes to see hidden people you have to walk away from your ball , then go back to your ball to touch it and `` capture people '' . 
  well in the meantime , whenever someone shoots the ball , everybody you 've seen is free and you have to go get the ball back . 
  those names change in various regions , especially cops and robbers, 
  [ les vieilles charrues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vieilles_charrues_festival ) , literally old ploughs . 
  it is located in carhaix , britanny , on that tip of land going into the sea in western france . 
  it was attended by 278.000 people in 2016 . 
  yes , that 's why i 'd call him center wing . 
  he 's a liberal , socially and economically, 
  macron is center wing maximum . 
  he 's very pro social security for example, 
  what was the problem in france ? 
  honestly i do n't know if there 's any decade where nothing happened in france . 
  the south-eastern accent around toulouse , montpellier and marseilles is the funniest . 
  it sounds lazy because it 's a bit slower and the fact that it 's a meditarrenean accent . 
  [ i do n't know how true this map is , but it gives the percentage of vegetarians per country ] ( http://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportid=25544 ), 
  it 's not , that comment is wrong . 
  see [ my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5u0896/is_college_free_for_eu_citizens/ddqmutd/ ), 
  same in france . 
  the original comment is wrong about engineering schools . 
  polytechnique students are ** paid ** 1164 $ / month during their studies . 
  they do n't pay anything . 
   for business or ingeneer school , it will cost near 10 000 $ per year . 
  for business schools and ** private ** engineering schools , yes . 
  my engineering school costed me 600 $ / year , it 's free if your parents are poor enough . 
  private engineering schools are much less valued than public ones . 
  nice b8 m8 r8 8/8, 
   in france , i get 20 gigs 4g ( 50 with another carrier , but coverage was n't as good ) for 4 euros per month  4 euros ? 
  no way . 
  i 'm paying 25 $ with sosh to get a perfect coverage , i have 20g a month of data . 
  i mean it 's 50go with free which i suppose is the bad coverage , for 16 $ -20 $ . 
  it 's 20 $ / month with sfr red and b&y ou has the same price as sosh without international calls and 4g . 
  or you 're paying one with a current promotion , in which case we ca n't really say how little we pay here in france because there 's much better elsewhere in europe and without promotions, 
  is also very frequent over here . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ nb ^ ^ ^ ^ : ^ ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ stop ^ ^ ^ ^ saying ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ sentence ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ ^ say, 
  remember the cycle : `` is this trip feasible ? 
  '' , `` what do you think about the federalization of the eu ? 
  '' , `` where can i study in europe ? 
  '' , `` do you really hate us americans ? '', 
  you 'll need to speak french here to study in france . 
  i mean , we have some classes only in english , but not for high school graduates, 
  also , only the most touristic cities, 
  not in my area . 
  the fn is strong in northern france and south-eastern france . 
  there 's no majority wanting to leave the eu, 
  it 's forbidden to have sex with a minor if you have a relation of authority towards her or if he/she sleeps at your place . 
  it 's completely forbbiden if the minor is under 15 years and 3 months old . 
  it would be super weird and someone doing it would look creepy . 
  macron is dating is former high school teacher and nobody cares about it though, 
  here litterally nobody knows the president of germany and when the elections are . 
  [ got the same for center/centre ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5mefnpz.jpg ) , he does n't even write different messages, 
  we have a satellite channel called astrocenter , it 's pretty funny when you 're drunk, 
  my high school did , i do n't know if it 's mandatory though, 
  britannia ? 
  i did n't say it was n't more expensive , i said it was pretty cheap, 
  internet data is expensive af ? 
  with sosh ( orange ) i get 20gb for 25 $, 
  well yeah but we do n't have neutral , and when both genders are involved it 's masculine , like if you speak about a group of 10 girls and 1 guy you 'll say `` ils arrivent quand ? '', 
  i meant that there 's a difference between \u00e9 and \u00e8 , sorry it was n't clear . 
  you 're right there 's no difference between those \u00e8 though, 
  indeed , h\u00f4pital , \u00eatre , t\u00eate , for\u00eat , basically all words like this used to have a s . the ^ marks a letter that disappeared because it was no longer pronounced . 
  the s is still there in variations of those words though , like hospitalier , forestier , etc. 
  the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise deleted a lot of those recently though, 
  yeah that 's indeed silly . 
  that 's very visible when saying english names or even words . 
  we often say them with a heavy french accent , and make fun of qu\u00e9bec canadians for using a heavy english accent in the middle of a french sentence . 
  it 's not always true though . 
  martin schultz is pronounced like in german , angela merkel is pronounced anjela only by people who do n't know how to say it in german ( so , it 's not really said anymore ) . 
  travaillais , travaillait , travaillaient are pronounced similarly , travailliez is pronounced completely differently . 
  the first ones are pronounced with a more or less pronounced \u00e8 , travailliez is pronounced i\u00e9 . 
  but i know that a lot of people learning french have trouble differentiating \u00e9 and \u00e8 . 
  there really is a huge difference for us . 
  edit : fixed a bit, 
  insulted is a big word . 
  look , we look down upon french born who identify as algerians because they keep spitting on france while they never knew algeria and why their grandparents left it . 
  when they go back to the bled ( aka the town their family is from ) they realize how bad it is . 
  it does n't stop them . 
  it 's just very silly . 
  same thing with americans . 
  i 've seen on reddit americans that say they can handle more alcohol because their family has irish origins . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  every single country in europe prides itself in drinking a lot . 
  i do n't mind if an irish american wants to know more about ireland and goes there to see what his family left . 
  i do mind however when they say stuff like `` fuck the british '' , they laugh at how nice the ira was for standing against the hateful british . 
  no actual irish would say stuff like that,
