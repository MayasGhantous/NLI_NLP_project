  i never really hear that . 
  we hear `` antillais '' in france because it 's a region of france . 
  we say maghrebi , but it 's more about ethnicity . 
  really i only hear it when talking about ancestry ( except for algeria , but it 's also not seen as good ) . 
  it 's because ethnicity and countries are two different things . 
  you can find hungarians in romania for example . 
  and you are american , traditions have changed a lot since your ancestors came to america . 
  hell italian americans do n't even speak italian . 
  how can they claim to be italian ? 
  sure , if are asked your ancestry , it 's not a big deal . 
  but do n't say to europeans that you are irish or german or `` scandinavian '' ( it 's not even a country ffs ) when you know anything about those countries , it sounds super weird . 
  and it does happen often on reddit , just take a look at / r/shitamericanssay, 
  ai and as/a are n't pronounced the same way though, 
  i mean in france it 's not difficult to find a theater that shows movies in original version , but yeah you got to go to a decently sized city first . 
  like [ if you check the gaumont cinema in nantes ] ( http://www.allocine.fr/seance/salle_gen_csalle=p0196.html ) , most movies are in original version ( vo ) , some are n't even dubbed at all . 
  those without vo are already french-speaking, 
  crossing a street in paris ? 
  how is that difficult ? 
  * sees german flair * oh right, 
   in the constitution , la\u00efcity is defined as a complete lack of religious influence in the public institution ; it apply in no way to citizens in their everyday life but le pen is fighting mostly over islamic symbols ( mostly burka and pork-free substitution meal in schools ) which is in fact anti constitutional . 
  that 's the most important part . 
  secularism ( la\u00efcit\u00e9 ) is defined as not caring about what others believe in . 
  there 's supposed to be zero distinction between religions . 
  if a person ca n't wear a muslim veil , another ca n't wear the a catholic one . 
  the thing that 's more debatable is whether secularism means `` everyone can do whatever he wants '' or `` everyone can do whatever he wants at home , as long as nobody else has to see it '' . 
  different political groups do n't agree on the subject, 
  well i 'm curious then . 
  what anthems are known ? 
  i only know about the bro gozh ma zadou ( breton anthem ) and nobody knows it at all here . 
  not really , it 's just our language . 
  italian and spanish are seen as sexy here, 
  they exist but they are mostly unknown, 
  this exists everywhere, 
  i guess we and germany both claim charlemagne . 
  funny you do n't know louis xiv that much , louisiana is named after him, 
  probably david guetta or daft punk for alive people . 
  dead people , i do n't know , louis xiv or napol\u00e9on, 
  yeah i mean maybe you 're right . 
  i 'm probably just an asshole haha . 
  they definitely do . 
  it 's seen as the stuff you like when you 're 15, 
  well the members were originally chosen because they were the major victors of wwii , only the us had the bomb initially, 
  yeah , as much as i dislike trump and love the eu , this is so far from reality it made me cringe, 
  tl ; dr : no , it starts all over again ( the election must be restarted in the 35 following days ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/constitution/constitution-of-4-october-1958.25742.html#titleii )  in the event of the death or incapacitation in the seven days preceding the deadline for registering candidacies of any of the persons who , fewer than thirty days prior to such deadline , have publicly announced their decision to stand for election , the constitutional council may decide to postpone the election . 
   if , before the first round of voting , any of the candidates dies or becomes incapacitated , the constitutional council shall declare the election to be postponed . .  in the event of the death or incapacitation of either of the two candidates in the lead after the first round of voting before any withdrawals , ** the constitutional council shall declare that the electoral process must be repeated in full ; the same shall apply in the event of the death or incapacitation of either of the two candidates still standing on the second round of voting ** . 
  france is the biggest importer of manga , mostly young people . 
  honestly apart from dragon ball z which is a part of pop culture nowadays , there is a huge stigma , no matter what amateurs say, 
  3 kids and not married , how is that socially acceptable ? 
  by living in a civilized society where not everybody cares about some religious rules, 
  imo the stereotype about the portuguese living in france is that even if they are 3rd generation they still view themselves as portuguese . 
  it 's kinda similar to algeria in that regard . 
  m\u00e9lenchon has almost no chances to win this election . 
  even if he went in secound round of the election against le pen i 'm sure a lot of people would n't even vote . 
  far-left scares right-wingers , center-wingers , hell even some left-wingers hate the far-left . 
  a lot of people also see him as a cuba lover ( [ `` cuba is not a dictatorship , for me it 's clear that it 's not '' , `` in the context of south america , i do n't agree with qualifying cuba as a dictatorship and salute its contribution towards the people 's fight '' ] ( http://bruxelles.blogs.liberation.fr/2011/01/07/jean-luc-melenchon-aime-la-dictature-cubaine-et-le-dit-bis/ ) and [ a venezuela admirer ] ( http://www.jean-luc-melenchon.fr/arguments/7-octobre-2012-presidentielle-au-venezuela-pourquoi-chavez/le-venezuela-vu-par-jean-luc-melenchon/ ) . 
  come on , his youtube channel has 190k suscribers , i mean , it 's nice but it 's not that much . 
  his channel has 389 videos and 11m views , so an average of 29k views per video . 
  it 's really not a lot . 
  that 's not really what happened, 
  best : controversial answer but probably de gaulle , he 's idealized by many people here . 
  worst : there are a lot of those . 
  i 'd say napol\u00e9on iii, 
  well first of all they need to improve their pr . 
  we do n't hear enough of the good stuff the eu did . 
  i mean from what i saw with people learning french , the mistakes are always the same , particularly noun genders . 
  your sentences were great already, 
  yeah but we 're talking about today cultural regions , and today , north of bayonne it 's not basque, 
  2000 years ago . 
  it 's a trend , like we have maps sometimes . 
  well you also seem to be talking out of your arse , with vague argumentation that never talks about germany or europe for that matter, 
  and this is why people from another country should n't tell you who to vote for without any knowledge of the politics of your country . 
  paris est le ** nom ** de la capital ** e ** de la france . 
  accents and genders mistakes , come on , it 's not that hard hehe, 
   but let 's not forget the annoying song of savez-vous planter les choux , \u00e0 la mode , \u00e0 la mode ? 
  pretty weird but it works, 
  ordinateur ( computer ) is your favorite thing to say in french ? 
  putain , encul\u00e9 ( butt-fucked ) , con ( originally the word for woman genitals ) , ... yeah it 's often about sex, 
  i think according to polls the support for independance has n't changed though, 
  having been twice in amsterdam , you do n't need a football game to have a lot of british tourists in the red light district, 
  i 'm curious , where did you go in france that you did n't like ? 
  because i 'm certain there 's a lot of awesome places you 've never been to, 
  a cuba and venezuela lover , great idea . 
  there are a lot of french-speaking humorists so imo everyone can find one he finds funny, 
  we have a shitton of nuclear plants ( 75 % of our energy ) but we 're trying to have more renewable energy ( 15 % at the moment ) . 
  [ official statistics in french ] ( https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sources-production-\u00e9lectricit-france-724x1024.jpg ), 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande , like all presidents before him , released at the moment of his election the list of his wealth and properties ( so it might have changed since 2012 ) . 
  it has a total value of 1.17 million euros ( much less than sarkozy , chirac and mitterand ) . 
  apparently it looks like [ this ] ( http://www.nice-provence.info/wp-content/uploads/ngg_featured/la_sapiniere-_villa_francois_hollande_mougins.jpg ) ( it seems difficult to have pictures , apparently it 's this one ) . 
  it 's a 130 m \u00b2 house with a pool in mougins ( south-eastern france ) apparently worth around 800.000 $ ( by comparison with similar nearby houses ) . 
  he currently lives in the [ palais de l'elys\u00e9e ] ( http://www.biotech-dental.com/admin/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/o-elyse-facebook.jpg ) . 
  he also rented a 100 m \u00b2 flat in the 15th arrondissement of paris for 3000 $ / month and has a small place in tulle ( where he 's been elected mayor and mp ) for 1200 $ / month . 
  he also has shares of two appartments in cannes ( 70 % and 30 % ) where his father and his brother live for 230.000 $ and 140.000 $ each . 
  he declared having 7258 $ on his bank account and 225.294 $ in debt . 
  note that some right-wing pms ( opposition ) said he was lying on this declaration , but take this with a grain of salt . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/05/11/francois-hollande-un-patrimoine-sans-surprise_1699753_1471069.html ) the comparison with former presidents is thus : - hollande 1,17 m $ - sarkozy 2,7 m $ - chirac 1,4 m $ - mitterand 1,45 m $, 
  so that we get the poorer part ? 
  currently , overwatch . 
  i used to play a lot of paradox games but overwatch has drained all my free time, 
  i 'm curious , where did we intervene recently without invitation ?
