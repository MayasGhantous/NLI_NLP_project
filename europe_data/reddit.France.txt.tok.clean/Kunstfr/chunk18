  not just in one city , foreigners basically own the c\u00f4te d'azur ( french riviera ) . 
  the nice airport is one of the biggest airports in france notably because of it, 
  when traveling always count one day of travel between each city ( even though it 's a bit less , it 's still exhausting and takes a lot of time ) . 
  particularly when you take the plane ( london - prague , budapest - palermo maybe ),

  good supermarket tho, 
  yep exactly this in france . 
  we have a [ hitchhiking competition between various schools here if people are curious ] ( http://www.poucedor.fr/ranking/year/2015 ) ( ranking in french but it 's fairly understandable : you have the team names , the number of kilometres and the school they are in , if you click on the team you get to see where they went ), 
  almost everytime you meet someone : m/f & f/f : everytime it 's a non-formal encounter m/m : close friends or family, 
  depends on the regions and people here in france . 
  personally yeah keep eye contact + arms must not cross each other when several people are cheering with each other, 
  so yeah a few festivals , i would n't say it 's anything but super rare . 
  in other countries people wear some very often ( seen in austria for example ), 
  well when talking about wwi he 's still seen as a huge hero but just his name is enough to think about the occupation and the collaborationist government which is seen as a bunch of fascists traitors, 
  not in france , it 's super rare, 
  yeah what he means is that for example , in the us m&m 's has the following types available : peanut , milk chocolate , peanut butter , pretzel , crispy , dark chocolate , almond , dark mint , dark chocolate peanut , chocolate bar and mega . 
  in france , these are available : peanut , milk chocolate , dark chocolate peanut , crispy and mix ( crispy and peanut in the same bag ) . 
  it 's trash if it 's shitty , i do n't think it 's about making money here in this thread, 
  andorra , not basque country, 
  there 's no flags for regions such as catalonia , wales , brittany or bavaria . 
  hong kong has a very different status from catalonia . 
  andorra should definitely be in the flairs , catalonia should n't, 
  are you british by any chance ? 
  it reads `` napol\u00e9on was stupid , meanwhile the british were doing this . 
  napol\u00e9on tried to do this , then the british did that . '', 
  even at [ waterloo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_waterloo ) the british had less men than the prussians, 
  i do n't see brexit content that often, 
  we have a different system so our engineering schools often rate badly on these rankings ( smaller schools , different system of pulications etc ) . 
  we have a very different system and most rankings are based on the english education system . 
  ecole polytechnique is considered the best engineering school in france . 
  around 320th in the shangai ranking ( arwu ) . 
  it 's [ a sort-of military school ] ( http://orientation.blog.lemonde.fr/files/2013/05/polytechnique-militaires-%c2%a9-%c3%89cole-polytechnique-j.-barande.jpg ) modernized by napol\u00e9on and formed many presidents and politics ( val\u00e9ry giscard d'estaing for example ) , ceos and famous scientists . 
  if you like science , [ you can recognize `` a few '' known people here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_%c3%89cole_polytechnique_alumni ) . 
  the [ ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89cole_normale_sup%c3%a9rieure ) is the one that has the best rankings internationally i think , being 67th in the arwu ranking , 37th in the cwur , 23th in the qs university rankings , 54th in the times ranking for higher education and 13th in the global employablity university ranking ( yeah i just found that on their website , anyway ) . 
  [ here is a list of the famous alumni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_%c3%89cole_normale_sup%c3%a9rieure_people#alumni ), 
  honestly i do n't know if it 's a good idea . 
  i might be wrong but i feel like some trolls will try hard to be in that top 10 and will want to shitpost more . 
  in france we eat [ galette des rois ] ( https://avis-vin.lefigaro.fr/var/img/97/24143-650x330-galette-des-rois-fotolia.jpg ) ( kings cake ) , which is usually made with frangipane ( almond ) . 
  there is a small figurine ( la f\u00e8ve ) in one of the slices , the person that gets it becomes the king ( we have small paper crown like on the picture at the beginning ) . 
  it 's done everywhere : family meals like school cafeterias . 
  usually when with friends and family , the youngest person goes under the table and tells who gets which slice ( `` who gets this one ? '', 
  `` you do '' etc ) , unless he 's done that for his entire life and he 's kinda sick of always going under the table like me . 
  through/thorough/though / throughout / ... globally all th words are annoying for french speakers , it 's even more annoying when the pronounciation changes completely ( thought/throughout ), 
  [ like this ] ( https://youtu.be/ybcvlxivscw?t=49s ) . 
  uk english sounds kinda fancy , but as i speak it i ca n't really say what it sounds like . 
  english is spoken pretty fast too, 
  belgium has awesome beer , germany has nice companies , switzerland has nice chocolate , italy has nice food , spain has nice beaches . 
  luxembourg err i do n't know i 've never been there, 
  9,76 $ in france , 7,58 $ after taxes . 
  that 's not a lot and way too many people only have this to live . 
  i guess the californian one seems high , but the cost of living is also high iirc, 
  nope , for the same reason that i do n't want it to be back in france ( it was removed something like 20 years ago ) : i do n't want to waste time there , it 's not really useful and it 's expensive . 
  til you are n't supposed to tell your friends when you sodomised a horse, 
  all the spanish exchange students in my school did love those spanish singers though, 
  it 's not really an unit of measurement here , it 's the word we use to buy beer in a bar . 
  if you ask for two pints you get two glasses, 
  0.5 in france, 
  yeah america is very far from being as bad as you say . 
  this is honestly a very stupid question and insulting towards actual refugees . 
  only the far right and right wing used to sing the national anthem , now everyone does it . 
  that 's about it, 
  brittany , france : 4 years ago, 
  it depends on how much of an accent it is or if it 's closer to a dialect . 
  maghrebi accents in france are almost the same as metropolitan france , but for instance most african accents are a bit harder to understand . 
  i mean if i lived here it would be fine enough , but sometimes on tv they are subtitled . 
  qu\u00e9bec ( french canada ) is most of the times alright , but it seems like when you go farther from the big cities , it might become absolutely ununderstandable . 
  it 's pretty much allright for city qu\u00e9becois though , but it might seem funny to us , especially as sometimes they use french words instead of some english words that we use ( for parking lot , we say parking , they say stationnement ) and when they use english words they have a perfect accent on it ( while we would mostly say it with a heavy french accent ) . 
  some words are weirdly different : gosses means children ( in a familiar way ) in metropolitan french while it means balls in qu\u00e9bec french . 
  for creole/acadian/cajun it 's a bit more complicated , you clearly see that it 's french , and you could probably speak an entire conversation with a native speaker if both spoke slowly , but they get subtitles as well . 
  they are the one that have the most differences with standard french , using a lot of constructions and words that we do n't really use . 
  economically and socially liberal ? 
  i 'm no expert but they all seem economically very protectionist . 
  and the fn in france is not particularly lgbt-friendly ( they just say nothing to not lose gay votes ) and a big part of the fn wants abortions to not be refunded by social security, 
  yeah he 's always like that do n't worry . 
  when you disagree with him he calls you a troll, 
  you can say joyeux no\u00ebl ( merry christmas ) to anyone , nobody would mind . 
  i 'm not christian and imo it 's not just a religious holiday anymore . 
  de mostly say bonnes f\u00eates de fin d'ann\u00e9e ( happy end of the year parties/holidays ) with people we wo n't be spending the holidays with, 
  england would not like this, 
  in france , it 's usually : - [ foie gras on toasts ] ( http://static.750g.com/images/1200-630/2c009c562e68f854a35b81cf1305aa1d/meli-melo-de-foie-gras-pour-l-aperitif.jpeg ) with some champagne - oysters/lobster/coquilles st-jacques - [ capon with something like potatoes in my family or something ] ( http://img.fac.pmdstatic.net/fit/http.3a.2f.2fwww.2efemmeactuelle.2efr.2fvar.2ffemmeactuelle.2fstorage.2fimages.2fcuisine.2fnos_recettes.2fcuisine_de_fete.2fpreparez-le-repas-de-noel.2f5096673-3-fre-fr.2fpreparez_le_repas_de_noel.2ejpg/345x258/crop-from/center/preparez-le-repas-de-noel.jpeg ) - [ yule log cake ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/b%c3%bbche_de_no%c3%abl_facile_%282014-12-23%29.jpg/1280px-b%c3%bbche_de_no%c3%abl_facile_%282014-12-23%29.jpg ) this is a traditional , average christmas meal in france . 
  in my family it 's pretty close to that on the 24th this year , and on the 25th it will be some beef meat instead of the capon and some apple pie for dessert . 
  in my family both we drink a lot on both days , but on the 25th it 's a more extended family, 
  as for spain and morocco : migrants, 
  i 'd love to learn breton but it 's really not easy, 
  at least it 's not obvious to me where you 're from, 
  ancestry is n't important nor is it interesting imo, 
  i mean , i 'm french and i have absolutely no idea what the point of this is . 
  i do n't need that , do n't want that , and do n't really care about it . 
  the only useful thing i see is paternity tests , but this can totally be done by a doctor , it 's not like it 's a problem that happens often, 
  geographically ? 
  hmm so the baltic states are n't eastern europe now ? 
  at least they accept autonomy . 
  france has forbbiden indigenous languages for decades , nobody cared . 
  and that 's just languages , autonomy does n't even exist in france, 
  i guess we do n't get our teeth whitened too often . 
  also , many people could n't ( or ca n't ) afford orthodontics treatments . 
  and honestly , teeth are n't supposed to be white like that . 
  this looks weird . 
  my bad , the french wiki page did n't mention the influence so i did n't want to say something wrong, 
  many vertical tricolor flags come from the french flag ( belgium , ireland , italy ) because of all the `` revolution '' thing it standed for,
