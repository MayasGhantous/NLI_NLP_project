  well some americans say a lot of shitty things . 
  from / r/shitamericanssay : [ `` renouncing my german heritage and start calling myself polish , [ ... ] at least the poles have had enough and are fighting back '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tcu340w.png ) [ irish people are n't really irish because they do n't hate the british , meanwhile irish-americans would chase them out ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bz6nefo.png ) [ i am 26 % scandinavian , so i think it really spoke to my nordic heritage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1cgmgts.png ) [ this 4chan greentext ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rm8csw1.png ) [ but it raises an interesting point - i have a great deal of scottish blood coursing through my own veins . 
  while i missed out on the red hair and fair skin , i have an affinity for alcohol and i will fucking fight you . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59lghe/the_hypocrisy_of_hillary_clinton_supporters_they/d99gcus/ ) [ i 'm nordic and was n't even born there , i 'm always super warm and have had people comment about how i dress too light in the cold . 
  ] ( https://archive.is/celiw ), 
  i definitely agree with the feeling of curiosity . 
  but i used curiosity for a reason . 
  no matter where your family comes from , you 're nothing but american now . 
  if you are 1/4 irish , 1/2 norwegian and 1/2 bulgarian , sure you can be interested in visiting those countries to see what it looks like , but do n't claim any culture from there , do n't say to europeans that you 're any of those nationalities , do n't claim that you are `` better at drinking because you are irish '' ( we see these a lot , and seriously , every european country claims to drink a lot ) . 
  what you said you did is alright imo , it 's just very cringey when americans go on / r/ireland saying that they are irish and everything while having never been there and just being a regular of some st patrick 's day parade in ny, 
  i was curious , and apparently he 's [ the only one ] ( http://www.lerugbynistere.fr/photos/620_px/les-salaires-du-top-14-et-de-la-premiersship-2015-12-08.jpg ) ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.lerugbynistere.fr/news/top-14-premiership-louis-picamoles-parmi-mieux-payes-championnat-paie-plus-gros-salaires-0812151216.php ) with in red top 14 ( french rugby union league ) and in blue the premiership ( english one ), 
  we do n't really have any in france , no . 
  people just take water bottles with them, 
  yeah i would say there are way more divisions . 
  i 'm from brittany , i do n't feel close to someone from the north or alsace . 
  honestly it 's more like north/east/paris / center/rh \u00f4ne valley/south east/south west/west/north west imo , with little in common between each other, 
  we make fun of belgians in our jokes , saying they are stupid and everything . 
  but honestly they are not that different from northern french people , and it 's a pretty good place for beer . 
  we ca n't really feel like it 's been stolen from us , it was never really french , it 's like french speaking switzerland imo, 
  for me an am\u00e9ricain is steak and fries in bread , at least in western france, 
  finland and estonia just love each other, 
  really ? 
  i think it 's disputed , i read a while ago that he had some stomach problems, 
  do i even need to argue about how any of these questions is easy as op asked ? 
  i litterally only know the answer to the first one because of eu4, 
  [ it * is * a dictatorship on paper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_democratic_dictatorship ), 
  that 's a stupid thing you guys did , but it does n't really change my opinion of the us . 
  the country is still a nice destination to travel and i still do n't want to live there . 
  imo obama was very charismatic and funny , well it 's not gon na be the same with trump , but it does n't really matter in the end . 
  i just think we 're in a pretty dark decade and hope it wo n't be as bad as it can be, 
  absolutely not ... each country has a distinctive design for their coins . 
  one side just says the value , the other side depends on the country . 
  there also are commemorative coins on top of that . 
  [ 1 $ coin ] ( https://www.usmint.gov/kids/coinnews/images/1-eurosbycountry.gif ) [ french euro coins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_euro_coins ) [ german euro coins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_euro_coins ) [ italian euro coins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_euro_coins ), 
  people : nice , but so dirty . 
  we had a lot of them as exchange students in my school , every single chinese appartment was dirty . 
  culture : really cool , i 'd love to go there and everything . 
  government : well it 's an awful dictatorship , but apart from that , their foreign policies are n't really different from other superpowers, 
  i ca n't take qu\u00e9bec french seriously , even when i watch sad and serious movies like mommy, 
  it 's forbidden since last march or april ( only forbidden in the depressurised part of the plane , aka op has to travel with the phone to bring it to nz ) edit : [ proof ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/23/news/companies/lithium-ion-battery-ban-airplanes/ ) , btw i know about that because i bought a laptop from another eu country , it had to be brought to me by truck, 
  you ca n't transport lithium batteries by plane, 
  yep . 
  as much as i dislike him , as much as i find the electoral college system idiotic and as much the fbi has changed the election , he still won and there 's nothing anyone can do about it . 
  ma\u00eetre / ma\u00eetresse ( literally master ) in elementary school too, 
  safety , weather , things to visit ( all i hear about russia is that moscow & st petersburg are cool , but that 's it ), 
  euro 2020 is in different european countries in contrary to regular euros where all the games are in the same country , 2022 is in qatar, 
  yeah but that 's lame , that 's not really the point of the euro . 
  i want to follow my team in one country , this euro will just be a collection of games everywhere in the continent . 
  would have loved to because it 's the perfect age for me to follow my team in another country . 
  but yeah , meh , i 'm unsure , it 's russia . 
  the thing is , with 2018 wc , euro 2020 and 2022 wc , the one in russia is the only one where i could do that . 
  fuck fifa and uefa with their shitty ideas, 
  i get what he means though , in wwii and wwi the us were already heavily supporting their allies ( + ussr in wwii ) , at one point the enemies decide to act against that support , so the us go to war, 
  really ? 
  it works for me, 
  gardens are usually behind the house , and can often have [ tables to eat , a few trees ] ( http://www.sohome.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/retour-au-jardin-par-quoi-on-commence_5500897.jpg ) , a [ potager ( apparently translated to kitchen garden ? 
  where you grow food , herbs , vegetables etc ) ] ( http://www.econologie-maison.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jardin-potager-720x320.jpg ) , [ a shed ] ( http://static.cotemaison.fr/medias_9325/w_1520,c_fill,g_north/un-abri-de-jardin-bien-integre-dans-le-paysage_4774801.jpg ) , a barbecue , things like that . 
  if you live in a part of france where the weather is good enough you may have a swimming pool too . 
  i 'm not exactly up to date on videogames so feel free to add more !, 
  beyond good and evil or dishonored i guess, 
  well this does n't seem to cover much of spain or france for that matter . 
  i think i 've been twice in spain : san sebastian and mallorca . 
  gl\u00fchwein is called vin chaud in the rest of france and is very well known . 
  it 's mostly champagne in my family though, 
  mont st michel in brittany , nice, 
  is it a belgian thing ? 
  i 've often heard it and i 'm from brittany so we 're not exactly close, 
  yeah i 've never seen artichoke on a pizza, 
  rock-paper-scissors in english btw, 
  i do n't know anyone who drinks that in france , so it could be that there 's too much alcohol or they 're just not used to serving this, 
  i do n't know , in french we have le guide du routard which coverspretty much the entire planet, 
  and in french londonien/parisien, 
  well i understand the question as `` what are some general policies of left-wing and right-wing parties in europe ? 
  '' , european party as in party from the continent of europe , not party for europe . 
  we do have eu parties however , that national parties chose to get in . 
  okay i 'll try but it 's a complicated question so feel free to correct me or tell me if some things need to be added to the list . 
  i wo n't talk about the policies of smaller parties or parties affiliated with the big two . 
  i know , the national front is a strong party in france but that 's not the question here . 
  ** common policies between the left and the right ( that differ from smaller parties or the national front ) : ** * support of the eu * support of nato * support of the military * ` migrants crisis ' : immigration is accepted but must be done with all security measures possible * ecology is globally a common policy now ( even though there seems to be more support for nuclear plants in the right-wing party ) ** left wing policies : ** i 'm going to be talking mostly about the [ socialist party ] ( http://www.parti-socialiste.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/logo-general-parti-socialiste.png ) 's policies . 
  * increasing budgets in education and healthcare * mariage and adoption ( other methods to have kids are in discussion and are not globally supported by the party ) for gay people * suppression of private schools ( law was eventually not passed in 1984 ) * more job stability * less police and sanctions for petty crimes * more equality in the sense that your family should n't give you unfair advantages compared to other people ( inheritance ... ) note that they 're called socialists in our country , but they are technically more social-democrats . 
  ** right wing policies : ** well there are many families in the french right wing but i 'm gon na talk in general for the right-wing party [ the republicans ] ( http://cdn-lejdd.ladmedia.fr/var/lejdd/storage/images/media/images/3557-002-logo-ump/10958548-1-fre-fr/3557-002-logo-ump.jpg ) . 
  * decreasing costs in public services * mariage is accepted ( by the major candidates at least as the law is already passed ) but no adoption or anything for gay people * freedom to give your kids the education that you want and the money that you earned in your life ( regarding inheritance laws ) * liberal economy with more freedom to hire and fire for employers * more control and sanctions for more security, 
  is n't the point of this subreddit that each country answers ? 
  it 's seen as a dangerous cult and that `` church '' has been sued multiple times . 
  i 'm not sure they have a lot of members in france , i 've never seen or heard about any member here, 
  well france is bombarding isis in syria and has artillery troops on the ground in iraq to bombard mossul . 
  other than that , they support the non-islamist rebels ( and probably supported islamist factions at first ), 
  i guess some bread with jam or nutella or something . 
  i do n't know if people eat a lot of snacks, 
  that 's not exactly in paris though, 
  anything else than paris or nice ( which honestly is n't very nice aside from the weather ), 
  jupp\u00e9 was n't that good in the last debate , he did n't seem prepared enough . 
  also , he 's very old . 
  i 've heard right-wingers disliked him because he was `` too left wing '' ( haha ) . 
  other than that , i do n't know, 
  some mr oizo , boris brejcha and victor ruiz . 
  love them all, 
  renault clio and twingo are the cars you see the most in france , i guess there also are some citroen like the c3, 
  or domac, 
  yeah not every family opens gifts at the same time .
