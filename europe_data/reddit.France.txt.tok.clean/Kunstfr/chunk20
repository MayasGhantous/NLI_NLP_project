  in mine , we open gifts when drinking the champagne before the meal . 
  dinner at 18:00 ? 
  wow , we do n't even start the pre-dinner drinking at that time, 
   nato as a military block , not true : nato started as a political organisation , and only became a military block after the korean war . 
  when a few years later the warchaupact was founded , nato was the natural choice to balance that . 
  wait your final sentence is exactly what you were arguing against a few comments ago, 
  sure then , but from the [ official nato history website ] ( http://www.nato.int/history/nato-history.html ) :  it is often said that the north atlantic treaty organization was founded in response to the threat posed by the soviet union . 
  this is only partially true . 
  in fact , the alliance 's creation was part of a broader effort to serve three purposes : deterring soviet expansionism , forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in europe through a strong north american presence on the continent , and encouraging european political integration . 
   [ ... ]  while the signing of the north atlantic treaty had created allies , it had not created a military structure that could effectively coordinate their actions . 
  edit : also , some countries [ received money from the marshall plan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/marshall_plan.svg ) without [ being a member of nato ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/history_of_nato_enlargement.svg/680px-history_of_nato_enlargement.svg.png ) at that time ( like ireland , west germany , sweden , switzerland , austria , greece and turkey ), 
  i mean i ca n't really say nelson is famous , but i 'd say he 's more known than wellington . 
  do n't quote me on that but i think we vaguely hear about the defeat at trafalgar . 
  it 's honestly difficult to know for sure if i 've heard that in school though , i played too many videogames and i 've always loved that time period . 
  i do n't now , [ i keep hearing ] ( http://www.historytoday.com/jonathon-riley/how-good-was-napoleon ) that napol\u00e9on was a brilliant military leader ( include here strategy , logistics and organisation of the army ) . 
  he was just a bad diplomat . 
  you ca n't really disagree with that , that 's the north-atlantic treaty itself ... at least answer with some details . 
  look i 'm going to highlight everything that makes it a military alliance in the full text of the treaty and everything that makes it an economic bloc :  * the parties to this treaty reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments . 
  *  * they are determined to safeguard the freedom , common heritage and civilisation of their peoples , founded on the principles of democracy , individual liberty and the rule of law . 
  they seek to promote stability and well-being in the north atlantic area . 
  *  * they are resolved * ** to unite their efforts for collective defence and for the preservation of peace and security ** . 
  * they therefore agree to this north atlantic treaty : *  article 1  the parties undertake , as set forth in the charter of the united nations , to settle any international dispute in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered , and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations . 
   article 2  the parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions , by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded , and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being . 
  ** they will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them . 
  < - mention of an economic bloc **  article 3  in order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this treaty , the parties , separately and jointly , by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid , ** will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack ** . 
   article 4  the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , ** the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened ** . 
   article 5  the parties agree that ** an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area ** . 
   any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the security council . 
  such measures shall be terminated ** when the security council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security ** . 
   article 6 ^ 1  for the purpose of article 5 , ** an armed attack on one or more of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack ** :  * on the territory of any of the parties in europe or north america , on the algerian departments of france ^ 2 , on the territory of or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer ;  * on the forces , vessels , or aircraft of any of the parties , when in or over these territories or any other area in europe in which occupation forces of any of the parties were stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force or the mediterranean sea or the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer . 
   article 7  this treaty does not affect , and shall not be interpreted as affecting in any way the rights and obligations under the charter of the parties which are members of the united nations , or the primary responsibility of the security council ** for the maintenance of international peace and security ** . 
   article 8  each party declares that none of the international engagements now in force between it and any other of the parties or any third state is in conflict with the provisions of this treaty , and undertakes not to enter into any international engagement in conflict with this treaty . 
   article 9  the parties hereby establish a council , on which each of them shall be represented , to consider matters concerning the implementation of this treaty . 
  the council shall be so organised as to be able to meet promptly at any time . 
  the council shall set up such subsidiary bodies as may be necessary ; in particular it shall establish immediately a defence committee which shall recommend measures for the implementation of articles 3 and 5 . 
   article 10  the parties may , by unanimous agreement , invite any other european state in a position to further the principles of this treaty ** and to contribute to the security of the north atlantic area ** to accede to this treaty . 
  any state so invited may become a party to the treaty by depositing its instrument of accession with the government of the united states of america . 
  the government of the united states of america will inform each of the parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession . 
   article 11  this treaty shall be ratified and its provisions carried out by the parties in accordance with their respective constitutional processes . 
  the instruments of ratification shall be deposited as soon as possible with the government of the united states of america , which will notify all the other signatories of each deposit . 
  the treaty shall enter into force between the states which have ratified it as soon as the ratifications of the majority of the signatories , including the ratifications of belgium , canada , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , the united kingdom and the united states , have been deposited and shall come into effect with respect to other states on the date of the deposit of their ratifications . 
  ^ ( 3 )  article 12  after the treaty has been in force for ten years , or at any time thereafter , the parties shall , if any of them so requests , consult together for the purpose of reviewing the treaty , having regard for the factors then affecting peace and security in the north atlantic area , including the development of universal as well as regional arrangements under the charter of the united nations ** for the maintenance of international peace and security ** . 
   article 13  after the treaty has been in force for twenty years , any party may cease to be a party one year after its notice of denunciation has been given to the government of the united states of america , which will inform the governments of the other parties of the deposit of each notice of denunciation . 
   article 14  this treaty , of which the english and french texts are equally authentic , shall be deposited in the archives of the government of the united states of america . 
  duly certified copies will be transmitted by that government to the governments of other signatories . 
   ^ 1 : the definition of the territories to which article 5 applies was revised by article 2 of the protocol to the north atlantic treaty on the accession of greece and turkey signed on 22 october 1951 . 
   ^ 2 : on january 16 , 1963 , the north atlantic council noted that insofar as the former algerian departments of france were concerned , the relevant clauses of this treaty had become inapplicable as from july 3 , 1962 . 
   ^ 3 : the treaty came into force on 24 august 1949 , after the deposition of the ratifications of all signatory states . 
  i mean , there 's just one mention of what you say in the article 2 , while the military alliance is mentionned in the introduction and in articles 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 10 . 
  how do you not agree that it is a military alliance ? 
   ** article 3 **  in order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this treaty , the parties , separately and jointly , by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid , will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack . 
   ** article 4 **  the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened . 
   ** article 5 **  the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
   any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the security council . 
  such measures shall be terminated when the security council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/sid-ecae8db0-f591ec88/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm ) i just took the first few articles , but it is and has always been created as a military alliance, 
  well in school i 'm pretty sure i learned about the code civil and all the modernization of administration and education , but yeah mostly it 's about conquering europe, 
  other french person here : we definitely do n't hear about him . 
  i think i only know that guy from napoleon total war . 
  i do n't think we hear any name beside napol\u00e9on for that time period , just the name of the countries who defeated france, 
  how much time do you plan on travelling ? 
  what do you like to do , partying , hiking , sightseeing , culture ... ? 
  nobody really knows whose impure blood it is . 
  some say it 's the invaders ' , some say it 's the nobles ' , i prefer seeing it as the people 's blood , fighting for freedom despite their impure blood, 
  yeah sorry i thought you were the original german guy . 
  our cr\u00eapes look exactly [ like that ] ( http://www.duden.de/_media_/full/p/pfannkuchen-201020438663.jpg?branch_used=true ), 
  in france the package shows with lines how much 1 eats on average , usually like 100g , so it 's easy to eyeball it, 
  the picture you showed is exactly what homemade cr\u00eapes look like . 
  it 's not necessarily folded btw , my dad always rolls them for example, 
  france abandonned indochina in 1954 and accepted the split into two countries . 
  when the soviet-backed one attacked the us-backed one , america interveined, 
  when i was still studying i thought i saw something like the scottish universities being much cheaper than the english ones , i do n't know if that 's true ? 
  someone who wants to know if the distance is big enough to stop people from fighting with swords i guess, 
  they never controlled the entirety of finland though, 
  someone call the ministry of the industry !, 
  someone wants to buy french cars !!, 
  our car industry will be fine after all !, 
  yeah that 's how i remember the indochina war from school . 
  the algeria war is way more complicated though , as there were a lot of european people who had been living there for a century and algerians who actually fought for france to remain in control . 
  it 's also one of the first times we 've seen islamists doing terror attacks . 
  it was a really dirty war . 
  imo the indochina war is described very quickly in comparison, 
  i 'd love to stop hearing about them all the time . 
  it 's a super cringey sub , and people keep asking questions about it ( like right now there 's a thread about the exact same thing in / r/france ) . 
  that 's ridiculous , but eh , if they really believe they will have any impact on our election , i 'm not going to stop them . 
  as long as they do n't bother me on my subreddits , i 'm fine with whatever they do, 
  i have n't seen any czechs begging in vienna and i 've lived there for a while . 
  are you being serious ? 
  on / r/travel i know there 's a wiki with the mobile data plans in europe ( and other countries too ) , but i 'm on mobile right now so i ca n't really go look for it edit [ this is quite good ] ( http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/prepaid_sim_with_data ), 
  every big city has also subbed version of movies . 
  well i do know that some military jobs do n't want people with dual citizenships . 
  i have a friend who 's a dual citizen from marocco and almost refused un airbus space & defence, 
  i do n't know , i think if people only had the choice in a second turn between trump and clinton and no third party , people could vote against the one they do n't like . 
  that 's what happens in france at least . 
  also , it makes more than two parties develop , as you can vote for your favorite one in the first turn even though you know they wo n't be elected . 
  then you vote against the one you dislike . 
  it 's better imo and kinda breaks the two party system . 
  a better system would be that you could rank 4-5 candidates by order of preference . 
  well yeah i think this question is mostly aimed at the few countries that practice rugby, 
  same in france,
