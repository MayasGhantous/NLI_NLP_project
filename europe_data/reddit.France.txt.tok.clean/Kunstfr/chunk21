  in france every city has those displays . 
  before most elections the candidates have these displays and if you 're registered to vote , you receive by mail information about every candidate, 
  well i mean , he will be in london . 
  london - lille or london - brussels is n't expensive and is definitely much cheaper than london - prague , as much as i like central europe . 
  well do you have any countries in mind ? 
  in two weeks you could easily go to many cities in western europe for cheap . 
  well it also depends on how cheap we 're talking but by train you can go to lille/brussels/amsterdam to grab beers . 
  also , i 'd recommand hostels , i 've always found nice people there to hang out with, 
  as i was living aboad , i used french to ` comment ' when something made me angry . 
  honestly , even if someone is good in french , if i do n't want you to understand what i 'm saying , you wo n't . 
  i can just apply a very heavy canadian accent or use old words . 
  i mean , i 've been downloading things for decades too , but a good ( eventually legal ) software makes the experience 100x better . 
  netflix sucks in france though, 
  maybe i 'm wrong but i do n't think there ever is christmas music on the radio in france . 
  at least i 've never heard that . 
  french , no dialect because dialects are almost all dead in france . 
  a bit of breton that i heard on tv and in my family but that 's about it, 
  i think we have to say frenchman . 
  if you 're in france though nobody would bat an eye if you said french . 
  in france it 's fran\u00e7ais / fran\u00e7ais for the language and for the name of the inhabitants, 
  it depends , sometimes it 's all capitalized , sometimes it 's only the first letter . 
  we usually do n't put the accents \u00c9\u00c8\u00ca\u00cb\u00c0\u00c2\u00db\u00dc\u00d4\u00d6\u00ce\u00cf i 'm not sure if it 's because there 's a rule or if it 's just because they are n't easy to write on computers . 
  i 'm not sure any surname has an accent though, 
  wait what are those four fronts you 're talking about ? 
  eastern as in eastern europe , western as in western europe , southern as in what , northern africa , and pacific front ? 
  because if that 's what you mean the uk fought in the same fronts as the us, 
  yeah they did but for like one month, 
  yeah , and also at the moment of the liberation communism was really strong . 
  in france : nope . 
  it used to be the majority of people saying the ussr contributed the most , nowadays people mostly think it 's the us according to [ that poll ] ( http://www.indigne-du-canape.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sondage-nation-contribue-defaite-nazis-1-e1431534484418.jpg ) . 
  note that i 'm not saying if i think it 's true or not . 
  contributed the most , i do n't think i can agree . 
  contributed little is stupid imo though i have to say by the way , even though we know the pacific theater was very important , we do n't hear much about it . 
  i think in history lessons we mention that 1942-1943 is the moment the axis forces start to lose , and we take as examples the battles of stalingrad and guadalcanal . 
  and , of course , the atomic bombs , but that 's about it . 
   american history is mentioned to some degree too since they had an instrumental role in [ ... ] the french revolution besides the american war for independance bankrupting france , is there another role america played in the french revolution ? 
  [ yep only foreigners say that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5aq7qb/what_do_you_think_is_the_stupidest_thing_we_have/d9ig5se ), 
  is guernsey even a microstate ? 
  i thought it was some british tax heaven . 
  not trolling , it 's an honest question, 
  chatterton ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4wq2qes1oo ) is cool and poetic imo, 
  i agree with what you said , except on the frequency . 
  really , there are lots of strikes , some are due to the cgt , some are small , some are all accross the country ... big strikes that last a couple weeks , maybe once every two years or something . 
  also it depends on who 's on strike , like for example the scnf ( train company ) is ` often ' on strike : [ apparently ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/visuel/2014/06/24/en-douze-ans-110-preavis-de-greve-a-la-sncf_4444359_4355770.html ) between 2002 and 2014 they 've been on strike 110 times . 
  yeah i played in french so the quote was `` je mourrai le marteau \u00e0 la main avant que la machine \u00e0 vapeur ne me batte '' . 
  kinda stupid to translate lyrics though . 
  also , i have n't played in years and still remember this . 
  i might have played a bit too much, 
  i 've heard of john henry in civ iv i think, 
  have n't seen any when i did that trip for all it 's worth . 
  and i was controlled while entering czechia , not when entering austria, 
  well she 's just one of our 2000 's popstars so it might be why we see her differently . 
  personally i would n't even say that she 's pretty , she looks weird to me , but that 's just my opinion, 
  i swear i knew someone would answer it . 
  no french person would ever say aliz\u00e9e is the prettiest girl on france but it seems like all of europe is in love with her, 
  d\u00e9jeuner ( lunch ) is around 12h-13h , d\u00eener is around 20h-21h in my family . 
  used to eat dinner way later with my roommates ( 23h ), 
  there are some parties in many night clubs but other than that , not really . 
  in my neighborhood maybe 2 groups fo kids ask for candy . 
  not that halloween does n't exist , but it 's pretty much nothing, 
  phew , dodged a bullet on that one, 
  maybe vienna , there 's a ton of history and culture . 
  you could eventially buy her something like vienna & prague and/or budapest , they are relatively close to each other, 
  i live near rennes , in brittany . 
  the oldest part of the city center is around [ here ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@48.1140233,-1.6801051,3a,75y,199.46h,96.8t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suvvogwnlol9py70jjfurpq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=fr ) . 
  note that there 's no wall around there . 
  there are n't many walls left , but you can see one [ here ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@48.1120697,-1.684863,3a,75y,279.5h,94.46t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-6-jgxzf9ngw%2fvt83mxf57oi%2faaaaaaabazo%2fin4-pu3s0kwb9vxpy8614hcn6kdzepiraclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-6-jgxzf9ngw%2fvt83mxf57oi%2faaaaaaabazo%2fin4-pu3s0kwb9vxpy8614hcn6kdzepiraclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi2.2335713-ya330.78595-ro0.10372287-fo100%2f!7i3584!8i1792?hl=fr ), 
  well songs in english are popular too , probably moreso than songs in french ( many french bands sing in english ) . 
  other languages , not so much . 
  sometimes we hear about a song in another language but it 's pretty rare, 
  well i do n't even know what this is or when that is so i guess we do n't celebrate it, 
  funny , i would have said italian spoken by girls . 
  is that his only job ? 
  pretentious, 
  shit that 's really awesome, 
  yeah and honestly i think 2 is too much ( and same thing for other countries in europe ) . 
  many foreigners , particularly from outside europe , only go to paris , or maybe paris + french riviera . 
  they do n't know much about the rest of the country . 
  personally , in brittany , i do n't feel particularly close from people from alsace or nice or something . 
  we speak the same language but yeah , same thing for wallonia . 
  [ teddy riner ] ( http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/var/plain_site/storage/images/judo/actualites/teddy-riner-un-an-d-invincibilite-de-plus-728832/18082343-2-fre-fr/teddy-riner-un-an-d-invincibilite-de-plus.jpg ) has won 8 judo world championships and won two olympic gold medals . 
  [ renaud lavillenie ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/2014_d%c3%a9canation_-_pole_vault_14.jpg ) is the current world record holder for pole vaulting and has won 1 gold and 1 silver olympic medals . 
  [ christophe lemaitre ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/christophe_lemaitre_rio_2016.jpg ) is pretty good at running short distances and is one of the three frenchmen to have broken the 10 second barrier in 100 m outdoor , and was the fastest european for 100 m and 200 m in 2010 . 
  well those three are the most famous current athletes . 
  we have many former athletes too ( like marie-jos\u00e9 p\u00e9rec ) . 
  as you only excluded football , i can mention tony parker who 's playing basketball with the san antonio spurs or s\u00e9bastien loeb for rally driving ( 9 wrcs won in a row ) . 
  and incest, 
  well that 's just far away in the countryside , where nobody goes, 
  thanks then , you probably now the current rules better than me . 
  yeah i had a doubt between 2k/3k km, 
  you need to pass a theoretical course with 40 questions ad you can only fail 5 , and you repeat that until you pass . 
  we do n't have a medical exam i can think of . 
  then you have a lot practical driving classes , at least 20 hours , but you can do as may hours as you need . 
  ( there are other types of processes , like you can drive with your parents at 16 yo after those first classes , you have to drive at least 3000 km , then you pass the exam ) . 
  then you pass the exam , it has apparently today a 55 % success rate , i think it used to be lower . 
  if you fail , in some regions you have to wait months ( i failed my first time in february , i passed it the second time in september ) . 
  on average the delay is 98 days . 
  a driver 's license costs at least 1200 $ . 
  if you fail , you 'll have to pay 500 $ more . 
  on average it costs 1700 $ .
