  we also have some maintenance questions , especially during the practical exam , where in the middle of the exam you 'll have to park somewhere and you 'll be asked one question about inside the car and one question about outside of it . 
  [ communists have l'internationale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykln5iqqw1e ) we do n't have many political songs no . 
  the right-wing party did [ a lipdub in 2009 though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdrs-jkzfro ) . 
  posting it is already cringeworthy, 
  yeah that 's why our notes show something that does n't exist ( yeah i know about that dutch town that actually built those bridges but that 's a stupid thing to do ) instead of historical figures, 
  it 's not a big deal . 
  naturism is not a huge thing , it exists , but it 's mostly in special places like nudist beaches and everything . 
  i do n't think you can be naked elsewhere . 
  other than that it 's not really a big deal . 
  nudity ( non-porn ) is not censored on tv , there 's just a warning like ( -10 ) or something if there 's a lot of nude scenes or sexual scenes ( blue is the warmest colour is for 12 years olds and more in france , it apparently was 18 yo in the us ) . 
  i do n't think many people have heard of him . 
  it 's not my kind of music but i do n't mind his music, 
  well it 's right after disneyland by amount of visitors . 
  there 's way more people in july/august but then they make more shows per day , so you never have to wait much . 
  40 \u00b0 c something when there 's a heat wave . 
  usually in the summer it 's more like 25 \u00b0 c , 30 \u00b0 c on a nice day, 
  well i 've eaten goulash in austria and in czechia and it did look like your p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt, 
  under 5 \u00b0 c is impossible for me . 
  well the coldest temperature i 've ever seen is probably -5 \u00b0 c so i ca n't even imagine the temperatures other comments are mentionning, 
  in france right now there 's a lot of discussion about where the migrants from the calais jungle ( being demolished this week ) are going , as a lot of conservative mps and region presidents do n't want migrants . 
  i 'd say that 's the biggest issue at the moment . 
  the thing is that the presidential elections are coming ( spring 2017 ) so the primaries are in the next few months , so much of the discussion is about that . 
  well the problem is that it 's going to be tricky to be representative of all the eurozone . 
  either you put one face per country , or you just do n't care and hope that people wo n't be upset about it . 
  anyway , charlemagne is one of the most obvious choices imo as controlling territory that streches over a big part of europe . 
  in terms of political figures i ca n't think of many which would n't upset other countries . 
  i mean , charles v also was controlling a big part of europe , but he was also the enemy of many other kingdoms ( france in particular ) . 
  or we could just have artistic and scientific figures like curie , mozart , people like that . 
  we have [ puy du fou ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puy_du_fou ) in france which is sort of a historical theme park , you have different time periods there, 
  yep it 's bastille day in english ( simply 14 juillet in french ) . 
  [ the wikipedia page has a lot of details on the previous parades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bastille_day_military_parade#history ) . 
  you can also ask on / r/travel, 
  [ yep we have a ` small ' military display on the morning of july 14th , here 's this year 's display ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub23chlva0w ) . 
  it 's honestly pretty big and a good amount of people watch it ( or go see it on the champs elys\u00e9es ) . 
  countries are invited every year , apparently it was nz ( at 54:00 of the video ) and australia ( at 51:00 of the video ) this year, 
  yeah that 's a galette saucisse . 
  they 're mostly eaten in eastern brittany ( around rennes ) but it 's not difficult to find them elsewhere in brittany . 
  [ breton galettes ] ( http://gazettedujour.fr/images/galette_complete.jpg ) are n't even very eaten outside of my region . 
  i do n't get how people survive without it, 
  it 's probably plus belle la vie , a 12-year-old soap opera set in marseille . 
  it 's shitty, 
  well he also apparently has a birth certificate from south tyrol so yeah it 's pretty tricky . 
  biggest touristic monument in the world , i do n't think it 's that surprising that these guys learn sentences in different languages ( they have probably heard you talking ) . 
  never play their games by the way , they 're scams, 
  yeah you have to be either crazy of very experienced to drive a car in paris, 
  not without a push from the government though : / for now breton ( and same thing for similar regional languages in france ) is only taught in a few bilingual schools which are a very very tiny minority . 
  just a few words that we use sometimes ( like hi , cheers or things like that ) but young people do n't really speak it anymore so even if i learned it i would never have the opportunity to speak it, 
  yep , i completely agree with you on that ( i 'm from brittany and breton is almost dead ) . 
  they only signed the european charter for regional or minority languages though , they did n't ratify it . 
  but nobody seems to care and some people are happy that regional languages die because apparently it 's necessary for the unity of the republic . 
  fuck that, 
   could n't they like name it the south or alpes-cotes or something ? 
  geez paca is a bad name lol . 
  calling it the south would annoy the other southern regions , there have been talks about calling it provence m\u00e9diterran\u00e9e but nothing is happening as of yet . 
   oh and having clicked the link , grande est really sounds as if you guys are still trying to affirm that no , the east is not germany . 
  cringy :') i do n't really understand your sentence . 
  are you trying to say that the grand est region belongs to germany ? 
  because if that 's what you mean , 1 ) no , 2 ) only a very small part of that region has actually belonged to germany ( [ map here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/alsace-lorraine_dialectes-fr.png/800px-alsace-lorraine_dialectes-fr.png ) : and even then , the pink and the orange parts of that region did n't even speak a dialect of german in the xixth century ), 
  provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur did n't change though . 
  but in france we just say paca . 
  ( paka ) you can see the new regions and the new names [ here ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a9gion_fran%c3%a7aise ), 
  cpge does n't give any degree though ( although you might register in a university on the side to get an equivalent two years of bachelor 's degree if you fear you 're gon na fail your cpge ), 
  yes if your parents do n't earn enough money ( 27 % of students ) , very cheap otherwise ( a few hundred euros a year ) . 
  of course we also have private schools ( mostly business/management and some engineering schools ) , where you 'll have to pay a few thousand euros a year, 
  well they changed the regions recently so you 've only never been to corsica now, 
  i 've never been in the overseas regions , but i 've been in all the metropolitan regions of france . 
  we only have 18 of those so it 's not that difficult . 
  with my parents when i was a kid we went to many departments ( smaller administrative division than region , each region has 3-8 departments ) . 
  there are a few nice cities in seine saint denis . 
  like 1 or 2 ... 
  well some newspapers do [ belong to media companies ] ( http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/img/png/ppa-1-3.png ) but they never belong to some international media company . 
  that picture shows to whom every media outlet belongs to ( in the middle circle you have a lot of rich families , the number in the smallest center in the middle is the ranking of how rich that person is in france ) . 
  french media also gets money from the state ( [ here is some data in french ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/05/06/aides-a-la-presse-qui-touche-le-plus_4411883_4355770.html ) , i do n't want to translate everything but globally the first two mean `` total amount of money received '' and `` total amount of money received per paper sold '' ) . 
  also , almost all newspapers have an online edition now , i guess they also make money that way . 
  globally medias in france are n't the best way to make a lot of money . 
  almost none of them is independant ( the only one being truly independant being [ mediapart ] ( https://www.mediapart.fr/ ) which is online only ) . 
  they are often criticized but yeah i think we 're pretty lucky in france to have those instead of tabloids . 
  weird , i 've never seen candy corn nor candy canes outside of video games . 
  well french is n't that close to other languages in the way it 's pronounced so yeah . 
  the closest languages would be italian and spanish and they definitely do n't speak english the same way . 
  we do n't really have regional languages and the dialects are n't really a big thing anymore . 
  globally every french person that has an accent in english sounds the same imo, 
  [ the french accent is easy to notice imo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgklgzqwvam ) , we say hard rs , we say `` ze '' instead of `` the '' , well i do n't know how to say it but yeah imo french people are often easy to notice when speaking english . 
  wow i 'm not the only one haha, 
   what i find stranger is that you often hear the stereotype that romania is one of the poorest/least developed countries in the region even though it 's literally the opposite ( which says more about the region than about romania , to be honest ) . 
  yeah well romania seems poor because i think we mostly compare it to the rest of the eu . 
  we do know that serbia , moldova , ukraine are also poor , but we do n't see people from there very often . 
   the food is at least as good as many other places in europe . 
   it definitely is n't the worst food in europe , but i do n't think food is that big in british culture compared to some other countries, 
  what country are you from ? 
  [ le monde ] ( http://img.kiosko.net/2016/10/18/fr/lemonde.750.jpg ) : one of the biggest newspapers , i 'd say it 's center-left , front page about tourism decreasing in france + battle of mossoul [ le figaro ] ( http://img.kiosko.net/2016/10/18/fr/lefigaro.750.jpg ) : one of the biggest newspapers , mostly right-wing , front page about the battle of mossoul [ lib\u00e9ration ] ( http://img.kiosko.net/2016/10/18/fr/liberation.750.jpg ) : one of the biggest newspapers , it 's mostly left-wing/far-left , frontpage today is about a scandal with a tv guy who is suspected of `` weird castings for an erotic tv show including minors '' and the tv channel he arrived to went on strike to protest his arrival then we have a lot of regional newspapers . 
  [ ouest france ] ( http://img.kiosko.net/2016/10/18/fr/ouestfrance.750.jpg ) : the newspapers that sells the most , it 's only sold in western france with a big part of it being regional news . 
  frontpage today being about the battle of mossoul and a big fire in a german factory [ le parisien ] ( http://img.kiosko.net/2016/10/18/fr/parisien.750.jpg ) : regional newspaper for paris , frontpage is about the lack of replacement teachers when teachers are sick [ website where i found those ] ( http://fr.kiosko.net/fr/ ), 
  too bad the website you linked is old and almost empty , it could have been useful, 
  the triplets of belleville , persepolis , kirikou and the sorceress , the king and the mockingbird , ernest & celestine are really good . 
  we have a lot of animated movies, 
  please , even as a zombie i would n't want to live with english people, 
  to answer op , in southern france they have floods, 
  [ y ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y,_somme ) [ condom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/condom,_gers ) [ montcuq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montcuq ) was pronounced like mon cul ( my ass ) in a [ tv show in the 70 's ] ( https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcy9z_montcuq-daniel-prevost_fun ) so it 's well known for this now [ deux-verges ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deux-verges ) ( two penises/two wands / whatever ) [ arnac-la-poste ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnac-la-poste ) sounds like arnaque la poste = scam the post [ bezons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bezons ) sounds like baisons = let 's fuck [ anus ] ( http://media.topito.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/anus.jpg ) [ vatan ] ( http://media.topito.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/vatan.jpg ) sounds like vas-t ` en = go away, 
  i also like [ meuporg ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meuporg-or-mmmporpg ) even if it 's quite old,
