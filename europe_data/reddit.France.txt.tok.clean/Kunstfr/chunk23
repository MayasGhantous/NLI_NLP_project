  we 'd be glad to remove the english for you guys, 
  in france , yes , girls/girls , girls/guys in non formal situations to greet friends and family . 
  guys/guys is also done with your family or if you 're close friends, 
  i have never seen or heard of any shelter in france . 
  a few probably exist , but it 's far from being common, 
  so only alsace then, 
  in french , moli\u00e8re . 
  [ it has been officially translated in english !, 
  ] ( http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/langues/welcome-to-the-english-website-of-the-french-national-assembly ), 
   france shall be an indivisible , secular , democratic and social republic . 
  it shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law , without distinction of origin , race or religion . 
  it shall respect all beliefs . 
  it shall be organised on a decentralised basis . 
  statutes shall promote equal access by women and men to elective offices and posts as well as to professional and social positions . 
  nice theory, 
  i mean that guy wants no cold or hot climate but accepts sk and singapore , so he 's either trolling or just ignorant . 
  on that theocracy part , we do find it weird that you guys care a lot about religion . 
  but if that guy thinks it makes the us a theocracy , he must have never been outside of western europe, 
  well i do n't know where that guy is from , but if you look at northern france bordering belgium they drink and produce beer , in alsace they have white wines like in some parts of germany but also beer , normandy and brittany have cider and do n't produce wine ( still drink it heavily though ) . 
  most french people drink wine though, 
  i lived outside a city and then lived inside a city , did n't have any friends drunk driving . 
  it still exists though , you can often hear stories about it . 
  according to that [ government website ] ( http://www.securite-routiere.gouv.fr/medias/les-chiffres-de-la-route/les-chiffres-de-l-alcool ) , drunk driving kills 1000 people every year in france ( population of 66000000 ) , which is 30 % of deaths by car accidents . 
  btw , alcohol is still seen as awesome here too . 
  i do n't know , i 've lived in austria and met a lot of young germans too while i was there , i could n't have a full conversation in english with most of them . 
  some would not even say a single word in english . 
  well arabic has another problem : we call it arabic , but it 's more like a big family of languages with every country or region having specific dialects . 
  someone speaking morrocoan arabic ca n't understand egyptian arabic for example, 
  to add to this , in my experience people mostly use facebook messenger in france . 
  hey now why do you guys use the same word for us as mexicans use for americans ? 
  that 's rude and offensive . 
  please find a new pejorative word for us, 
  / r/askeurope is very far from the general opinion in europe . 
  reddit as a whole does n't represent europe correctly . 
  hey could you annex wallonia too ? 
  we do n't wan na, 
  i do n't know , i 've never been to an american football game , but [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqxjniof9z4 ) seems pretty much only about songs and nothing else . 
  it 's very family friendly ( it 's probably the case for a lot of european football games , but that video says it 's `` the best [ ... ] '' ) . 
  i mean , compared to [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndqkasezwa ) , i do n't even see how it compares [ even international games seem way less boring ( even though this one was actually dangerous ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ege7oz8ns ), 
   it 'd fall apart . 
  usually unions of small number of countries where one of them is much larger than the others just breed dissentment . 
  so , the uk ? 
  i mean it looks good but it all seems too official . 
  it 's part of the organization of the game , but i would n't call it a great atmosphere . 
  it only shows a show . 
  it surely is fun , but that 's definitely far from the atmosphere from a european soccer game, 
   western european countries tend to forget about it , but i find it rather ignorant . 
  wtf ? 
  do n't worry , we know that europe ! = eu ... why the hate ? 
  [ do n't speak so fast . . ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/bordeaux-33000/primaire-2017-juppe-en-tete-avantage-sarkozy-chez-les-sympathisants-lr-sondage-25-09-2016-6148151.php ) ( poll : first round of the right-wing primaries , jupp\u00e9 38 % sarkozy 34 % , 56-44 in the second round ), 
   not allowing hitler to invade gibraltar i do n't know the story , why is it a stupid decision ? 
  i 'd say he 's still seen as that pretty cool guy that conquered a big part of europe . 
  of course we know that he was a dictator and ended the first republic , but he also helped modernizing france and its institutions ( [ the civil code ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleonic_code ) for example is still in use today even though it changed a lot , the metric system , modernization of education by improving elite schools like the [ ecole polytechnique ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89cole_polytechnique ) or just founding a lot of secondary schools ) . 
  the [ map of the french empire ] ( https://lecheveusurlalangue.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/france_l-1_1812-fr-svg.png ) still makes me drool . 
  my bad i only know 3 of those . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  well in french we translate many flemish cities ( like dunkerque ) . 
  wait why do so many flemish cities end in - en ? 
  i ca n't think of many in the netherlands, 
  a decentralized one . 
  it 's really not the case in france but i 'm a bit sick of a lot of politicians that have no idea what the hell is going on outside of paris . 
  i believe that local governments have more interests in improving their own area , rather than managing on a national scale and sacrificing big areas ( often rural areas ) to profit others ( often urban areas ) . 
  do n't worry , according to the other comments me and every person i know are the only people in france that would find it weird, 
  yeah well it would definitely sound weird if someone offered a friend to give him a massage, 
  where are you from ? 
  i have n't even seen a massage in years , and i 'm not sure it 's a regional thing as my friends are from many regions, 
  i 'd never offer a friend a shoulder massage . 
  if a friend offered me one i 'd laugh because it sounds gay ( no homophobia though ) . 
  i 've never seen any massages between friends . 
  maybe girl friends ? 
  it 's a bit sexual yeah . 
  it 's something you would do with your boyfriend/girlfriend . 
  i know that in physiotherapist schools they do it regularly with their friends but that 's about it, 
  wow , we also did that same thing . 
  the record distance is nantes-copenhaguen ( 1576 km ) back and forth in 48 hours, 
  highjacking your comment : i took the `` science '' specialization . 
  i had history/geography , english , german , philosophy , physical education , maths , physics/chemistry , and biology/geology . 
  we have to chose one scientific class to specialize ( between phy/che maths and bio/geo ) , i took physics/chemistry . 
  litterature was studied until the penultimate year , we had an exam then did n't have it in the final year . 
  in france it 's pretty safe . 
  the best way to hitchhike , from experience , is to go ask directly to people in gas stations in highways . 
  if you 're in a city , try to be at around a roundabout leaving the city, 
  i do n't think we talk much about it . 
  we might mention a few times that we had a big colonial empire particularly in africa , we talk about the algerian war pretty quickly . 
  that 's all i remember from school, 
  both , even though some night clubs are more made to `` meet '' people than other night clubs . 
  well i still keep a bit of money form when i travel , but i 'm talking about a few coins and small notes , not more, 
  hussein was probably not a good guy , but invading iraq and leaving it in a huge mess was very probably the worst decision of the century . 
  [ france completely opposed it ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/french_address_on_iraq_at_the_un_security_council ) , as this was purely warmongering . 
  it 's kind of the same thing with lybia , except that the situation there is not as bad as in iraq ( yes i know there 's civil war there but it 's very far from what 's happening in iraq & syria ) . 
  and as with who we support : same as the us, 
  two passports with different names ? 
  because i think the ticket is associated with your name , so if you want to have two passports = two names you 'll need different tickets, 
  putain is pronounced more like pew-tah ( it 's difficult to transcribe those sounds in english ) . 
  poutine is pronounced like putin, 
  that 's poutine, 
  we swear pretty often . 
  [ putain , putain , putain , it means whatever the context is ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bfrk2seieaedbs9.jpg ) . 
  we try not to swear in front of kids though . 
  yeah i 'm not so sure about that .
