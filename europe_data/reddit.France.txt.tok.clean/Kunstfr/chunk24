  in some threads it 's very far-right , it 's some threads it 's really not . 
  i do n't really understand that sub anymore, 
  honestly i ca n't think of many things that we ca n't find in supermarkets ( and that we like ) . 
  what state are you from ? 
  perhaps this would help, 
  you might also want to try / r/travel . 
  both are probably very safe . 
  the chance to have a terror attack in those airports is still very very low . 
   bonus points for cool things to check out in belgium the delirium ...  beyond the beer shit, 
  i know some people have very precise work schedules . 
  i 've worked in two places , both were pretty much flexible . 
  i like to wake up early so that i have more time for myself when i go home , so something like 8:15 -12:15 13:30 -16:30 makes my `` required '' 7 hours ( not that i 'm forced to do that , but i feel like it makes me look serious ) . 
  i often work more than that , depends on the amount of work other good things with going to work early is that 1 ) other people do n't know when you arrived , they wo n't judge you 2 ) nobody sees you doing nothing at 8 am, 
  ard\u00e8che is clearly not known as much as it should be . 
  imo an european army does n't mean suppressing all national armies . 
  i 'm really against it . 
  france has interests in africa that most other countries do n't give a fuck about . 
  france is interventionist , many countries in europe are absolutely neutral . 
  however , everybody agrees that defence is important , so we should have a defence force . 
  the un is not exactly functional because of how the security council works . 
  and nato implies that we need to put all our trust in the us . 
  considering that many american taxpayers are sick to see their money go to fund militaries in small european countries , we have to get ready for a world without nato . 
  it makes no sense for small countries that only have a few million inhabitants to pay 1 % of their gdp as nato requires , because it 's not enough to have a functional army . 
  however , they could participate directly for a continental defence force . 
  i was going to say once upon a time ... man , i did n't even know it existed outside of france, 
  in french we have those , avant-hier ( literally before-yesterday ) and apr\u00e8s-demain ( after-tomorrow ), 
  very common , that 's how we learn how to write, 
  the first group uses the sound \u00e9 , the second group uses the sound \u00e8, 
  march\u00e9 / marcher/marchez sound the same , but marchait/marchaient are pronounced differently, 
  everybody holds the door . 
  we do n't mind if someone starts a conversation , but if it 's just small talk because your job requires you to be polite , it 's just useless and annoying ( and probably exhausting for those workers ), 
  0 $ , there was no books ( engineering ), 
  i do n't know , i like the idea of being strong in a `` scary '' world . 
  i do n't like the way the european democracy is built with too much indirect democracy , but having an eu defence force ( with national armed forces too ) would allow us to be independant from the us , which many countries in europe are n't at the moment . 
  i feel like the countries we have right now are very artificial anyway , countries like france have been created out of at least a dozen cultures , so why could n't we do this with countries that share similar cultures ? 
  also , we could take the best out of every country . 
  some regions in europe have better education systems , some have better healthcare . 
  we could take the best out of everything . 
  i do n't fear a homogeneisation of cultures like some people do ( precisely because there still are tons of regional cultures , even though languages have been simplified ) . 
  it 's just my opinion . 
  i do n't know what other people see in a more federal eu . 
  sad , but not surprised honestly . 
  unless the uk view on the eu changed dramatically , imo that was the only way to have a more federalized eu . 
  there 's three pretenders : [ the legitimist louis xx of house bourbon ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/louis_xx.jpg ) , [ the orleanist henri vii ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/henri_d%27orl%c3%a9ans%2c_comte_de_paris%2c_%c3%a0_poissy%2c_le_27_avril_2014..jpg ) , and [ the bonapartist napoleon vii or iv ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/prince_napol%c3%a9on.jpg ) . 
  most monarchists are orleanists though, 
  so i 'm going to answer the opposite question as we are already a republic , we do have monarchists in france . 
  they are often right-wing ( alliance royale ) or far-right groups ( action fran\u00e7aise ) . 
  they do n't have enough popular support though ( in the parliementary elections they did below 0,1 % scores ), 
  yep that 's the big difference between visiting paris and actually living there . 
  that 's also why many people who grew up outside of paris have trouble adjusting to the living style of paris . 
  the english word bite means dick . 
  [ when english advertisers use french words in their ads , it can make really funny ads ] ( http://media.topito.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/traductions_merde_027.jpg ) * ( small dicks , big compliments ) * edit : [ this ] ( https://i.redd.it/a0nj8x2ziljx.jpg ) was a top post on / r/france a few weeks ago . 
  there 's also [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/s1equc7 ) ( bouch\u00e9es meaning both the english `` bites '' and `` clogged '' , ie * clogged dicks * ) edit 2 : oh , another one . 
  `` sale '' means dirty in french . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.whereonsale.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lingerie_600.jpg ) reads `` dirty lingerie '' in french .

  t'es putain de mort , gamin . 
  t'es putain de mort , gamin . 
  it was a joke , feel free to add good beers !, 
  vienna or prague . 
  i just loved both of these cities for different reasons . 
  at my age i 'd choose prague for the night life . 
  in a few years , definitely vienna . 
  our best beer is kronenbourg . 
  and this is the reason why we mostly drink belgian beers . 
  my favorite `` mainstream '' beers are st bernardus abt 12 , chouffe and tripel karmeliet . 
  it depends on the regions . 
  a lot require eye contact , no crossing arms is something i 've only encountered in my family ( brittany ) . 
  sometimes we say `` yec ` hed mat '' too ( in breton ) , but yeah , mostly sant\u00e9 or tchin, 
  a drink with a lemon taste , so imo sprite and 7up are technically lemonades ( even though they are much sweeter ) . 
  i want to say that most of the time it 's carbonated water ... 
  but we also have citronnade , which is with still water . 
  fanta is fanta . 
  a syrup with water is just syrup here . 
  wikipedia says citronnade is supposedly being made out of lemons and still water while limonade is lemons + sugar + water ( mostly carbonated ), 
  i do n't think `` 100x worse '' is accurate , but apparently from what i 've read on reddit russian immigrants quickly went into organized crime , while middle eastern and african refugees mostly do petty crimes . 
  i do n't know how much of it is true and how much is just old stereotypes .

  take a eu roaming package and you 'll be fine, 
  because \u00df is a `` special s '' , and the s is already taken by sigma i guess, 
  in the town where i was a student , i rented an appartment for 450 $ ( with the government giving 90 $ a month for that appartement , so i paid 360 $ ) . 
  the city and its urban area is 600k inhabitants and i lived in the center of the city . 
  wow that schengen country looks cool, 
  you just mispellt you 're / your, 
  yep i agree that some people are harder to integrate than others , and that video , that picture are really sad , but they are the most extreme ones . 
  it 's really not as frequent as you might think . 
  it 's not like all people of migrant descent become like your pic or dance on police cars . 
  there 's a big economical problem , and [ according to that article ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/banlieues/article/2016/05/03/dans-les-quartiers-prioritaires-le-chomage-affecte-de-plus-en-plus-fortement-diplomes-et-non-immigres_4912791_1653530.html ) , people living in the bad suburbs are more unemployed , whether they are migrants are not , the unemployment rate is at 26,7 % . 
  this is a lot . 
  the solution to all these problems is to take care of these suburbs . 
  nobody here is saying that there are no problems . 
  but you 're overstimating the number of those by only watching videos . 
  i 've never seen anyone being mugged , assaulted , or whatever . 
  i have two friends that come from the shitty suburbs of paris , they are both successful engineers and they have never been mugged in their life either . 
  [ yep i can find the same propaganda shit in the us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=muslims+attack+americans ) edit : wow your video is really shitty . 
  so there 's like 5 videos , we do n't even know if they 're migrants , muslims , middle eastern ( some of them being black , some of them we do n't see what they look like ) , 5 videos while the eu has 500 million inhabitants . 
  yeah , your 4 minute video does n't prove shit about the frequency of those, 
  you can probably find videos like these in any other country in the world too . 
  it does n't mean it 's a frequent thing, 
  yep probably the same in france , and maybe even europe .
