  some people only visit the capital cities and nothing else, 
  portugal . 
  especially during football events . 
  for plenty of people the family name is also the nickname , i do n't know , it 's not that strange imo . 
  in my group of friends almost everyone has a nickname so we do n't really use first names . 
  my bad , i just told what i learned in class . 
  and i think we use playback differently . 
  we say `` to sing in playback '' , i do n't know if that 's the same in english, 
  it is a bit different from other cities because it 's clean and people are richer ( not even joking ) . 
  apart from that , it 's inside france , their football team plays in france ... 
  it 's as much in france as san marino or vatican city are in italy . 
  there 's a lot of `` fake anglicisms '' : words taken from english where the meaning has changed . 
  ** french - english ** footing - jogging jogging - sweatpants playback - lip sync zapping - channel hopping smoking - tuxedo/dinner jacket baskets - sneakers baby foot - table football planning - schedule camping - camping site goal - goalkeeper flipper - pinball machine, 
  yep definitely . 
  saying only the last name is a friends things only . 
  last name is way more polite in professional situations, 
  wow , i just read about that guy 's history , it 's awesome . 
  he sold the eiffel tower to scrap dealers by pretending to be paris city hall , he said the tower 's steel was for sale . 
  the buyer was so ashamed that he never said anything to the police . 
  then that crook did it again , but that time the new buyer told everyone about it . 
  he fled to the us where he wanted to trick al capone , but he did n't manage to escape him so he had to give back the money , and al capone congratulated him for his efforts and gave him $ 5,000 . 
  at his 47th arrest he was sent to alcatraz where he died . 
  people in that thread seem to hate selfies and selfie sticks . 
  do n't worry , it 's fine as long as you do n't annoy anyone and do n't use it to take selfies 24/7 ( except in the places where it 's banned as other redditors have said ), 
  it was on tv , not a newspaper as i thought you meant, 
  i just showed you the real archives from those newspapers . 
  you just take an analysis from another newspaper and expect it to be more true . 
  [ the guardian did n't ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2011/sep/06/9-11-attacks-guardian-archive ) , [ bbc did n't ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/11/newsid_2514000/2514627.stm ), 
  not mainstream media ... why would anyone publish that ? 
  his shows in the beginning of the 2000 's were honestly one of the funniest , or at least one of the most popular humorists at the time . 
  nowadays , not so popular anymore, 
  yep , we have some cool things , but in my daily life it does n't really impact me much , and i like to travel anyway so if i lived in another country it would n't be a big deal !, 
  but you 're right, 
  the food . 
  apart from that i do n't think we have much better things than other european countries . 
  i 'd probably live in another country if i did n't have friends and family in france . 
  i would n't go live in the us though , i like our welfare state , our healthcare and so on . 
  thanks for the information , that 's why i was unsure in my first comment . 
  yeah i 've never heard of friends and family with an engagement ring , do n't know if i 'm wrong or if it 's a regional thing, 
  same as you . 
  married people i know of `` only '' have a normal golden/white gold/silver ring . 
  from what i 've seen in american series and movies , they seem to have two rings : engagement ring and wedding ring . 
  not sure if that 's true or if i 'm mistaken , but ~ ~ we only have a wedding ring here ~ ~ ( edit : may be wrong , read comments below ) . 
  i was a bit young , but it was definitely shocking . 
  it was not a national tragedy for us , but we felt for the us at the time . 
  i do n't agree with the other commenters here saying `` it 's just a terrorist attack '' , come on , 2500 deaths is not nothing , just like in paris 130 deaths was also not nothing , and 191 in madrid was not nothing . 
  big terrorist attacks are always shocking , and the wtc was way bigger than those two, 
  just use the atm where you 're travelling, 
  i do n't think scotland will join the eu soon honestly . 
  the polls still are n't in favor of independance . 
  i do n't know which countries want to joint the eu right now , but i hope it wo n't be until we have a good plan on what we are doing, 
  some french youtube channels : [ e-penser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g5sivjnjm4 ) , a science vulgarization channel [ mrantoinedaniel ( subtitles available ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioz0gkhytee ) and [ salut les geeks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze5ccw1kcbc ) , both are similar to ray william johnson , they make fun of weird internet videos . 
  of course each one does his own thing different from rwj [ le fossoyeur de films ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiows15nbm ) , he talks about cinema , recent movies and old movies , pretty good . 
  i like [ pv nova ( subtitles available ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdz1k1cf8y ) , he 's a musician that can play a ton of instruments , and he 's pretty good at decrypting music genres and everything . 
  he 'll show what typical musics in that genre sound like , and even create one out of scratch . 
  [ joueur du grenier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msz3-l4w9im ) , a bit like angry video game nerd , he plays old shitty video games . 
  hilarious these are the most interesting imo . 
  there are way more channels than those of course . 
  same as op . 
  wait is that a thing in the uk ? 
  that 's definitely what we use in france, 
  * a tes souhaits * ( your wishes ~ ) for the first sneeze , * \u00e0 tes amours * ( your romances ~ ) for the second sneeze . 
  i 've heard that it used to be a way to blame the sneezing person for disturbing you , like `` yeah , i 'm following your wishes , do whatever you want '' . 
  i do n't know if that 's true . 
  nowadays it 's just the polite way to acknowledge the sneeze . 
  we have a lot of those . 
  we use the english ones , but also : - mdr : literally * mort de rire * , dying of laughter . 
  it 's like lol - xpldr : this one is more tricky , it 's * explos\u00e9 de rire * , exploding of laughter . 
  same thing as mdr you can find dozens of the same kind like xptdr ( explos\u00e9-p\u00e9t\u00e9 ( ? ), 
  de rire ) , etc - osef : * on s ` en fout * , we do n't give a fuck - oklm/opgklm : * au calme * , * au plus grand calme * . 
  do n't know how to translate that . 
  it 's sort of a slang term . 
  could be used to say that you agree with someone , that you like something , or even if you 're just chilling somewhere , you 're `` oklm '' . 
  - fdp : * fils de pute * , son of a bitch ca n't think of much others right now that are really used a lot , but then again , these acronyms are not really used on reddit , for example edits : comments below are very good, 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande is the french president, 
  many qu\u00e9becois do n't even have an accent . 
  but those who do have that thick accent , you have to focus to understand as much as with thick african accents . 
  similar difficulty ( but very different accents ) , although qu\u00e9becois have more often no accent than africans, 
  in western africa , they have a heavy accent , the words are pronounced sometimes more quickly , not accentuated on the same parts , the `` r '' is less thick and more rolled , but overall , it 's easily understandable . 
  of course every country in africa has a different accent and each one uses a few different expressions or words . 
  but it 's way more similar to metropolitan french than cajun or even creole, 
  i 'm curious , do you have a thread where you think people did n't answer honestly ? 
  what do you think is our honest opinion of the us ? 
  quad and jetski too in french, 
  never heard of that stereotype but thanks for the answer !, 
  i want to say that marseille is `` badville '' in the sense of a violent city . 
  people from marseille will tell you that it 's the most beautiful city in the world however . 
  northern france is targeted for all the jokes about incest . 
  in paris it 's very frequent in touristic places : they show you that they are deaf and/or mute and ask you to sign a petition or give a donation to an association . 
  they decide on how much money you have to give based on your appearance . 
  sometimes an accomplice steals in your bag while you 're distracted . 
  also , some people steal your cellphone just before the subway doors close so that you ca n't run after them . 
  another scam is when you 're at a caf\u00e9 people often put their phone on the table . 
  someone shows you a petition or a sign asking for money , but they put it over your phone , and steal your phone . 
  there 's many scams and thieves like that . 
  do n't be paranoid , just be careful . 
   no possibility of safe cycling found the dutch, 
  in my region it 's 110 kmh but i get what you mean, 
  in france the closest major city is always maximum 200 km away from you , and you almost always have a wide variety of programs . 
  however , depending on what you want to do , you light want more specific schools .
