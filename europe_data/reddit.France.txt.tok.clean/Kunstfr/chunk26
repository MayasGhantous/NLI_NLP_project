  as grandes ecoles chose you on the grades you got in an exam , you might have to move accross the country ( although you can chose which schools you 'd prefer , sometimes the best schools are n't near you ) . 
  i even know someone from new caledonia, 
  seriously ? 
  90 km is just the next city in france , it 's frequent to live way more than that . 
  not even counting erasmus i 've met many people commuting 150 km everyday, 
  you should probably update that, 
  our carribean islands have been french for longer than some regions of mainland france though . 
  sure they were colonies but the fact that you said that they were still colonies is wrong , they have the same policies and administration as mainland france and can even get autonomy if they whish so , which most regions ca n't, 
  from my region , [ kouign amann ] ( http://www.philippemaudet.com/sites/philippemaudet.com/files/produits/dsc_0647_web.jpg ) and [ far breton ] ( http://www.maxi-mag.fr/sites/default/files/styles/lightbox_images_800x600/public/media/recipe/2015-03/far-breton.jpg?itok=oddov4wm ) . 
  i 'm going to talk about the case of france but i assume it 's the same everywhere . 
  in the beginning of 2001 , small and medium sized companies were able to do all their accounting in euros . 
  around october the banks had finished converting all the money into euros . 
  technically i guess it was gradual , but in our point of views , nothing had changed . 
  because : on january 1st 2002 the euro was the official money but we could still pay in french francs until february 17 2002 . 
  technically , everything had two amounts of money showing the old price and the new price in euros for a while [ like this ] ( https://www.cairn.info/loadimg.php?file=riges/riges_263/riges_263_0082/riges_idpas_d_isbn_pu2001-03s_sa13_art13_img001.jpg ) . 
  and we could exchange notes at the bank until 2012 . 
  i see what you mean but they are french citizens , use the euro and everything . 
  that 's why i said this :  most of french overseas regions want to be a part of france . 
  [ they rejected a referendum for more autonomy in 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_guianan_status_referendum,_2010 ), 
  [ very ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/charles_meynier_-_napoleon_in_berlin.png ) [ probably ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/wernerprokla.jpg ) [ germany ] ( http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/img/jpg/verdun-53659_cle0a89c5.jpg ) . 
  what colonies are technically part of my country ? 
  i can only see new caledonia which has a referendum for independance scheduled for 2017 , for example mayotte rejected independance while the rest of the comoro islands wanted independance . 
  most of french overseas regions want to be a part of france . 
  in africa we have what we call fran\u00e7afrique , which is basically a foreign policy of protecting our interests there . 
  it 's basically the continuity of the colonial era where for instance our companies get the most contracts they can have there . 
  like the [ diamonds affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diamonds_affair ) where president val\u00e9ry giscard d'estaing was offered some diamonds from emperor bokassa i of the central africa . 
  on a more personal point of view , we like our african colonies , they do speak french so i think we get more news about them than other countries . 
  qu\u00e9bec , canada is pretty much universally loved . 
  they speak a funny form of french , and as canadian cities look a lot like american ones , it 's like our own little french us . 
  many people in france dream of working there . 
  president de gaulle is famous for saying [ `` vive le qu\u00e9bec libre !, 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vive_le_qu%c3%a9bec_libre ) ( long live free quebec ! ), 
  to piss of the british and show his personal support for what was in his opinions thousands of french people forgotten after the seven years war . 
  cajuns & creoles in the us : most people do n't even know they still exist . 
  it 's a bit more tricky though , their french is much harder to understand . 
  edit : morocco and tunisia are in a similar position as the rest of africa . 
  algeria , however is more tricky because they fought for their independance , if was a really dirty war with torture , terror attacks in france and everything . 
  today they still speak french and a lot of them go find a job in france or just study , but even there they love to remind themselves that they are algerians . 
  they have a really strong national identity , probably because of us . 
  why would they even want to do that ? 
  they 're getting better economically every year thanks to the eu, 
  haha , autocorrect is a bitch to type in english, 
  this is not disney world , it 's our daily life . 
  do n't slow down people in the subway , do n't walk in the middle of the road , be polite etc, 
  i 've never been to the baltics and romania , my bad, 
  i feel like czech republic and poland are the fastest growing `` former '' communist countries edit : my feeling was apparently very wrong !, 
  you only tip if you really liked the service in france , and then you just put some coins or small notes on the table ( i 've never seen tipping outside of restaurants/caf \u00e9s ), 
  yeah because they are poorer . 
  it 's not a big deal in france , as i said , we have a birth rate of 2.01 , and according to your statistics , non-muslims have a birth rate of 1.9 . 
  they even predict a constant birth rate for non-muslims and a decreasing birth rate for muslims . 
  seems good to me, 
  yeah thanks for the data , it helps to prove my point, 
  in france we have a nice fertility rate of 2.01 , and that 's far from being only because of immigrants . 
  it 's mostly because or pro-child policies , generous childcare provision , nice welfare etc, 
  `` everything else '' ? 
  there 's plenty of things you wo n't find in portugal . 
  [ brittany , france is also big on seafood ] ( http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/france/brittany/experiences/news/seafood-lovers-guide-to-brittany-france-10664 ) , it 's just different seafood, 
  very typical french breakfast : - croissant/pain au chocolat - coffee - orange juice - toasts with butter/marmelade, 
  it was done at first to put some order in the lof ( which is like the book that says if your dog 's race is pure or not ) ... 
  honestly i do n't have a dog , it sounds weird to me too ( and honestly if i wanted a dog i would n't really care about its race ) . 
  i 'd rather have the bonaparte guy honestly, 
  honestly i feel like the growing discontent against politics could potentially lead to a vith republic . 
  but i do n't know , french people love to have a big leader in charge of everything , i do n't know if we could have a regime that 's not a presidential monarchy, 
   do n't make jokes like `` czech this out '' . 
  meanwhile all the guided tours in prague make that joke, 
  my parents and family do it every autumn , and we did it with a few friends last year ( the goal was more to drink than to hunt mushrooms though ) . 
  i 'd say it 's frequent for people who live outside of cities . 
  many letters are missed . 
  it started in 1926 with the letter a , and the letters kqwxyz are not in the `` canine alphabet '' anymore because it was too difficult to find names, 
  dogs are supposedly called using the year they were born ( in 2016 , the name should start with the letter m ) . 
  it 's not mandatory at all but it 's very frequent to do that . 
  anyway , some common names for pets : dogs : m\u00e9dor , rex , old people 's dogs are stereotypically poodles named kiki ... cats : minou , mistigri , f\u00e9lix , many people try to make a joke out of the name, 
  we do n't really celebrate it . 
  some kids go rick-or-treating but if there 's more than three groups of kids that 's impressive . 
  night clubs also have themed parties . 
  it depends on how good he speaks french . 
  if he 's fluent there 's obviously no problem , if he 's capable of saying a few sentences i 'll just speak french slower and not use words you do n't learn in school , if that 's just a few sentences he learned in a phrasebook , i 'll speak in english . 
  i prefer subtitles , but as we dub everything in france , when i was young there was plenty of things that i watched dubbed and it 's difficult for me to watch subtitled now , like scrubs , malcolm in the middle etc, 
  france has always been opposed to regional languages unfortunately, 
  yeah i was going to say that in france you can only use letters and diacritics that we use . 
  dutch people have a lot of those , and then they go to southern france or farther . 
  in french tradition it 's the first sign that summer started to see those on our roads, 
  i like corsica , but you can have nice if you want . 
  i 've visited salzburg and linz , but not long enough to be really surprised ( apart from the beauty of those ), 
  well sometimes it 's not the region 's fault , but the country 's . 
  in france if you dare be pro-regional languages , even on reddit , people are going to insult you and throw the first article of the constitution at you that says `` indivisible republic '' = only french . 
  i do n't think basque is as spoken in french basque country as in spain . 
  i had to go there for six months , and it was far more than what i expected . 
  i 've mostly been in vienna so i 'm gon na talk about that : i thought it was going to be a nice historical city with a correct night life . 
  well boy , was i wrong . 
  the historical part of the city is way more impressive than any other city i 've visited , the night life is crazy and makes me reconsider going back to france . 
  there 's also other things i had n't even considered : everything is clean and safe , the food is awesome ( and seriously though , the portions in restaurants are huge ) , i did n't even know that the danube as used the way it is , i went to a district in the north ( well now i ca n't remember the name , it 's pretty famous ) with a lot of vineyards and everything . 
  the only thing that surprised me negatively is the paperwork ( + fees you have to pay ) you have to fill in when you come live here . 
  i know , i know , but it 's just weird to have it written in our constitution in 1958 . 
  it was never mentioned in previous constitutions , so why did they feel the need to say that france is a `` decentralized state '' which it is not ? 
  for a bit of history , france was far from being as split as the holy roman empire , but there also were a lot of duchies and kingdoms ( brittany , burgundy , provence for example ) . 
  the difference being that the kings of france , after the hundred years war against england , started to reduce the powers of local lords . 
  by louis xiv ( xviith-xviiith centuries ) , france was almost unified , and all the major institutions were in paris , thus the centralization we have now . 
  they do n't want to join , and i do n't want to force them . 
  we 've seen what happened with the uk .
