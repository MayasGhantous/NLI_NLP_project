  if we want to reform the eu to get a stronger political union , countries that want to join need to know where we 're headed, 
  yeah i find it quite ironic too . 
  i did some research on wikipedia . 
  it 's a decentralized state `` because it gives authority to local administrations '' . 
  it 's not an economical decentralization but a political one . 
  which is still pretty much ironic compared to countries that are very decentralized and of a similar size , like germany . 
  also , it 's not like it 's an old article that compared the political ideology to the pre-revolution regime , this sentence is only in the constitution of the vth republic ( the current one that started in 1958 ) , it was not in the previous constitutions . 
   i realize that for some countries ( britain , france , spain etc. ), 
  this is harder to answer than others . 
  it 's not that it 's harder , it 's just that nobody had to recognize our sovereignty , countries as we know them did n't even exist . 
   france shall be an indivisible , secular , democratic and social republic . 
  it shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law , without distinction of origin , race or religion . 
  it shall respect all beliefs . 
  it shall be organised on a decentralised basis . 
  statutes shall promote equal access by women and men to elective offices and posts as well as to professional and social positions . 
  nice theory, 
   if anything i think that would be a good thing , i can only imagine how ridiculous things would be if the eu consisted of france , germany , italy , and spain . 
  why does it necessarily have to be a continental union ? 
  and i 'm sorry but when poor countries enter the eu , it costs money to the bigger ones.that 's a good thing , because it 's an investment ( worked nicely for ireland and poland for example ) , but we ca n't invest in 15 countries at the same time . 
  also , there were 6 countries at the beginning , not 4 . 
  yep i agree with you . 
  however , in your post you say :  although i do understand that other countries have just as much right to join i really do n't feel like anybody has the `` right to join '' , in my opinion the eu must serve its own interests . 
  i like british people when they only are a few , because they are n't noisy , are n't much drunker than others and are curious about other nationalities . 
  in my experience , groups of a dozen british people are annoying as fuck because they yell in english for hours while being very drunk and annoying everyone that 's not as drunk as them . 
  i 'm completely opposed to it . 
  the eu is n't stable enough as it is . 
  let 's consolidate it before adding more countries . 
  our economy is already suffering from this enlargement . 
  miss france is pretty big in , well , france . 
  almost nobody cares about regional beauty pageants though , and child beauty pageants are forbidden . 
  honestly my opinion on it is that it 's a really creepy , idiotic , boring thing and above all , very , very subjective . 
  we have other student associations though with traditions and songs ( at least in some universities and in most schools ), 
  not in france . 
  each wines must be drunk differently, 
  well , i did n't know how to explain my view on the french system , but basically the same thing as finland ( except that it 's not overrated because nobody says our education system is good ), 
  do people really recommend cars to travel between portugal and czechia here ? 
  this is waaaaay more expensive than flying or taking the train ... that 's [ around 350 $ per trip ] ( https://www.viamichelin.com/web/routes?departure=lisboa&amp;arrival=brno&amp;index=0&amp;vehicle=0&amp;type=0&amp;distance=km&amp;currency=eur&amp;avoidclosedroad=false&amp;motorway=true&amp;toll=false&amp;vignette=false&amp;orc=false&amp;crossing=true&amp;caravan=false&amp;car=hatchback&amp;fuel=petrol&amp;fuelcost=1.36&amp;allowance=0&amp;corridor=&amp;departuredate=&amp;arrivaldate= ) and like 30 hours of driving ... 
  the problem op is the dog and the cat . 
  maybe by train , i 'm not a specialist on traveling with animals, 
  yeah it seems like they change the numbers to adapt it to a sort of purchasing power income . 
  in many recent toilets you can clean your hands , sinks are pretty frequent in there . 
  yeah , i 've seen a bidet once at my grandmother 's house , i heard it 's nice , but i never really used it . 
  where does the data for median income come from ? 
  in france that would be 930 $ / month ( minimal wage of 7.39 $ / h with 35 hours a week would make 1100 $ / month ... ) , while it 's actually 1772 $ / month after taxes with official statistics ... 
   french - arrogant  dutch - arrogant meanwhile , the only thing our two countries agree on is that belgians are stereotypically stupid, 
   they take few showers where does this even come from ? 
  we [ shower just as much as americans , even moreso than the british or the germans ... ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/02/screen_shot_2015_02_12_at_6.56.46_pm/b783e237d.png )  they are the weirdos that have a room only for the toilet aka the best thing ever ? 
  you ca n't poop if someone is taking a shower , wtf ? 
  yep , i agree with you , just wanted to add more information on how the commission is doing at the moment, 
  yeah the eu is far from being safe from corruption ... [ 30,000 lobbyists for 31,000 staff employed by the european commission ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/lobbyists-european-parliament-brussels-corporate ) [ barroso , who now works at goldman sachs , was massively pro-banks in the commission ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/power-lobbies/2014/05/record-captive-commission ) [ tobacco industry lobbying for example ] ( https://euobserver.com/institutional/132170 ), 
  i agree a bit , but your map is oversimplifying the situation . 
  in many of these languages there are mutually inintelligible dialects inside countries , like voralberg german and viennese german are heavily different . 
  no , really not . 
  in my opinion it 's just as diverse as any other actual country, 
   everyone largely speaks the same language , has as similar history , and the same government massively diverse same for most countries in europe ... 
  in france almost everyone speaks french and not a dialect of it , we all have the same history with a few exceptions in a few regions ( like in the us with california , texas and the south in general , but also hawaii and alaska having different histories ) , and everyone has the same government in a centralized country . 
  one important thing i 've noticed on reddit is that americans and europeans , as expected , mostly know their region of the world . 
  i mean , i 'm european , so i know very well the culture of france and i 've been to many countries in europe and i 've seen the differences , and obviously , if you live in the us , it 's more difficult to have the same knowledge about european countries . 
  it 's also true in the other direction , not everyone in europe has visited the us , and whether europeans like it or not , the us are n't an homogeneous country . 
  so when we see such a comment about how the us is a very diverse country ( it 's a really common comment on reddit ) , we laugh because we do n't see much differences in the us ( but that 's due to ignorance !, 
  ) , and we always have the same answers . 
  i mean , yeah , the food is different and the accents are different , just like in any other country , so yeah the us is diverse but for its size , not that much . 
  so , just to answer on your comment , yeah i 'd agree with you , the us is as diverse as a country gets ( even though i do n't see what biomes and animal diversity have to do with it ) . 
  one thing you have to realize is that everyday on reddit and other social platforms , we hear about american exceptionalism and how the us is the greatest country on earth . 
  this is of course not what every american thinks , but this is not something you 'd hear about any european country ( because of differences in history , education , and a tendancy to bash our own countries ) . 
  we 're kind of sick of hearing `` america # 1 ! '', 
  not the french one :(, 
  the text ... 
  it could at least be more stylish in latin or something ... 
  in my experience , we do n't count the bathroom as a room because you almost always have one ( and when you do n't , it 's explicitely explained , like it 's shared or something ) . 
  same for the kitchen . 
  in france , studio is when you have a kitchen/living room/bedroom that are all in the same room + bathroom separated , t1 is when you have the kitchen separated from the other room . 
  basically , tx , where x refers to the number of big rooms , whether they are living rooms , bedrooms , whatever . 
  by the way , your example shows the square footage ( 64 m \u00b2 ) . 
  and you have a plan of the appartment so you can clearly see how many rooms you have . 
  we won the bigger half , you have to call it saint martin now !, 
  thanks to this , we lost a big part of regional languages !, 
  my main issue with french boxing was the gloves . 
  they were so disgusting , full of sweat of hundreds of kids . 
  the kids that had pe on monday were happy because they were cleaned during the week-end ... 
  i do n't think so ... at least i ca n't remember it . 
  we did some rugby though . 
  it was ... surprising to do that, 
  we do n't have a choice , there 's no way i 'm drinking english beer, 
  same as others here , we learn british english and use american english because of their entertainment industry . 
  but really , in the end , it 's neither british nor american because you 'll be more focused on our heavy accent than on the words we use, 
  they are pretty popular in the sense that i know many people that practised any of these ( well not wrestling ) when they were younger . 
  we do n't really do that in school though . 
  there we usually do badminton , table tennis , basketball , volleyball , handball , french boxing , and sometimes just running . 
  quite the same things as what people from other countries commented : first of all the college loans almost do n't exist here . 
  some people take a loan if their parents do n't give them a lot of money , just to be more comfortable ( we 're talking about a few thousands euros ) . 
  finding a job is not so easy in france , but you can hope to find a job in the first couple years after graduation maximum ( depends on the field , in my field it 's more like 4 months ) . 
  parents usually give money to their children until they get an actual pay . 
  if the parents do ' t get enough money , you can still get some money for a few months after graduation . 
  you do n't own a place immediately , you usually wait at least a few years . 
  in the meantime , you just rent a flat . 
  kind of same for everything honestly . 
  i do n't think anyone can make a correct list of which one is overseas department and which one is an overseas collectivities . 
  new caledonia , same thing except that we speak about them way less . 
  i know some of them want independance , but i do n't know much about them .
