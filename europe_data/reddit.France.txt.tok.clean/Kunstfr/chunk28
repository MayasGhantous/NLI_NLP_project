  they 're litterally on the other side of the globe , so we rarely go there ( no every french president goes there , and when they go once in their term , they do n't go back after that ) and they rarely come here , except if they have to study in mainland france ( which is the case of the only person from new caledonia that i know of ), 
  to answer op 's question , we play 8-ball in france, 
  nope to everything . 
  i grew up without any religion , i 'm interested in the sociology and history of religions but do n't believe in any . 
  my opinion on that topic is that i 'm completely certain that there is absolutely nothing , no god , no heaven , no destiny , nothing . 
  i completely accept other people 's religions though , do n't worry . 
  yeah and he also split brittany into two which is clearly a bad thing, 
  well the collaborationist regime during ww2 is really badly seen . 
  marshall p\u00e9tain was a hero from ww1 but i think people tend to forget that stuff and only see him as the head of vichy france ( or `` free france '' , because it was not directly under german control ) . 
  he was not really the worst guy in the vichy administration though ( [ pierre laval ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_laval ) was ) he has n't been sentenced to death because of his old age . 
  the thing is , we 're a bit ashamed of that regime because it gave many french jews into nazi hands ( much more than requested by germany ) . 
  it 's not really something that happens anymore but after ww2 many politicians were discovered to have worked with the vichy regime , which were pretty much huge political scandals , as collaborationnists are seen as traitors to france and fascists . 
  note : technically , the vichy regime has been declared not an official regime of france by general de gaulle ( who later became president and is the huge symbol of the liberation ) even though the parliement has voted to give him full powers over the country ( 80 against , 569 in favor , but again , he was seen as the hero capable of saving france again ), 
  that 's pretty different in the netherlands though, 
  well some people do n't travel outside of their country so i do n't see why they 'd feel european, 
  in france it 's really illegal as the website i linked states, 
  just to clarify , i 'm against brexit and agree with those arguments . 
  i just find it stupid to simplify the arguments of the leave voters to the point that they do n't even make sense anymore, 
  yeah , that 's where the problems are . 
  but that 's the idea , and that 's what those people thought when they voted to leave the eu . 
  insulting them of being insanely dumb or nationalistic maniacs is wrong, 
  the idea is that the uk gives more to the eu than it receives from it . 
  by not giving anything to the eu , the uk can directly give the money to those people and still keep more money . 
  it 's not as simple as insanely dumb/nationalistic maniacs, 
  [ that 's also illegal in france ] ( http://www.elaee.com/2014/06/12/20316-entretien-dembauche-les-10-questions-illegales ) : they ca n't ask you in job interviews in france : - are you married ? 
  - questions about your health - sexual orientation - religion - if you 're part of a work union - political opinions - if you have kids or if you 're pregnant - your criminal record ( except in some jobs for security reasons ) - your country of origin - questions on other members of your family, 
  do not debate with him . . his thoughts are always extreme some people seem to not agree with that . 
  let 's remember a few previous posts on that sub .

  can france play with this ? 
  we 're basically in the headlines of shame everyday, 
  honestly , eastern europe does n't have a very good reputation in france . 
  not that it 's justified , i would love to live there . 
  i just do n't think many french people feel the same way,

  / thread, 
  we do n't really eat them in restaurants though , it 's mostly in small sandwich shops, 
  oh , imo we love it and we eat it pretty often . 
  we just do n't really have many mexican restaurants , and i think the food we call `` mexican food '' would be considered an heresy in mexico . 
  but we have kebabs though !, 
  mexican food . 
  yeah and imo anyone should do that when visiting another country . 
  be respectful of other countries , this is n't an amusement park, 
  he did his campaign on very left-wing promises ( `` my enemy is the financial world '' ) and did the same liberal laws as the right-wing . 
  the only left-wing measure he managed to pass was gay marriage . 
  i also believe there was a lot of media bashing against him in the first years of his mandate , always saying how incompetent his government was . 
  his popularity fell very quickly while he did n't really do anything wrong . 
  well , at first . 
  now the bashing is more deserved . 
  also , a part of his party and allies known as `` frondeurs '' were quickly opposed to many center-wing policies , destroying one of the most important things in french politics : party unity . 
  also , yeah he did n't manage to bring unemployment down and competitivity up as promised . 
  terrorism kind of helped him at first because of sympathy points , but now the government is seen as failing to protect his citizens . 
  popularity does n't mean `` i will vote for '' though . 
  even if he has something like 15 % of popularity ratings , he still has more voters than that, 
  i do n't know if you 're serious but the burkini bans come from right-wing mayors, 
  i do n't understand the question . 
  why do you need a motto to `` remember europe '' ? 
  i do n't think we have any us military bases in france though, 
  i knew what that was without clicking, 
  do n't worry , you can do it !, 
  the best thing is to practice it by speaking with someone , but yeah that 's not easy , i 'm in the same situation with german ... 
  do you speak french ? 
  because some sounds are difficult as you do n't have them in english, 
  wtf ? 
  well looks like you and i will be colleagues, 
   the fact that all the elite professional leagues ( besides soccer ) are in the states apart from mlb/nhl/nfl / nba what are the elite professional leagues that you have ? 
  yep , we can still both be proud of her then, 
  the difference being that marie curie left to france when she was 24 , studied there , married there , worked there and died there . 
  einstein fled his country and only got american citizenship for his last 15 years . 
  she 's buried with her husband in the panth\u00e9on in paris, 
  yeah i only used wi-fi though, 
  well that 's what they advertise , not what i get . 
  i can download things at 6mbps, 
  1 gbps , 30 $ / month with optic fiber . 
  that 's an offer with a few more tv channels though, 
  native french , my english is good enough to speak and understand it . 
  i should really practice my german more . 
  i can read it and understand big parts of it , but no way i speak it with my vocabulary . 
  other than that , i want to learn breton, 
  is that a top 10 ? 
  did they put british empire as more evil than nazi germany , soviet union and imperial japan ? 
  and no china ?!, 
  no khmers ? 
  i did n't know that the british empire ended in 1997 , was hong kong the only reason for them to call themselves an empire ? 
  and the french empire ended in ... 1980 ? 
  because of the independance of vanuatu ?!, 
  the portuguese empire in 1999 because of macao , but the independance of east timor in 2002 does n't matter ? 
  how did they pick the years ? 
  okay , next thing on my mind . 
  so what the creator considers an evil empire is usage of torture , making people walk thousand of miles and letting them die , and killing people in wars ? 
  why is n't the us on that list then ? 
  oh , the comments answer me : `` because the us in not an empire '' . 
  neither were most of the countries on that list , especially in the xxth century . 
  i 'll take france because i know that example better , the first french empire was from 1804 to 1814 , then 1815 , then the second french empire was was from 1852 to 1870 . 
  if you consider the french * colonial * empire , you might say until the 1960 's when all the colonies in africa became independant , or you might say never because we still hold land outside of europe . 
  the us also controls lands outside of its continent .
