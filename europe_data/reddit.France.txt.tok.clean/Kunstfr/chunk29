  i 'm more ashamed of the algerian war , especially because a relative of mine was there and he never told anyone what he did over there . 
  fantomiald in france !, 
  i do n't see who you 're talking about . 
  there 's only marie curie , a french citizen by mariage with a french citizen, 
  shit yours is much better, 
  [ apparently we have 48 national parks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regional_nature_parks_of_france ) . 
  they 're all in very different regions . 
  [ this is the one in armorique , aka brittany ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/view_along_monts_d%27arr%c3%a9e_1.jpg/800px-view_along_monts_d%27arr%c3%a9e_1.jpg ) . 
  it 's in the middle of the region and the `` most montaineous '' part of brittany . 
  [ this is one in chartreuse ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/le_charmant_som_et_chamechaude_depuis_le_col_de_la_grande_vache.jpg/800px-le_charmant_som_et_chamechaude_depuis_le_col_de_la_grande_vache.jpg ) , you may know the name because of a disgusting alcoholic beverage , but that 's also a place close to the german border . 
  [ this is the one in corsica ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/0_scandola_osani_jpg01.jpg/800px-0_scandola_osani_jpg01.jpg ) , well at least a part of it close to the sea . 
  corsica always looks nice anyway , it 's nicknamed * \u00cele de la beaut\u00e9 * ( beauty island ) . 
  [ camargue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/camargue_fg01.jpg ) is also pretty well known . 
  [ this is the landes area , south of bordeaux ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/pins_des_landes.jpg/800px-pins_des_landes.jpg ) . 
  not that beautiful if you ask me , but it used to be a marsh and from what i 've heard napol\u00e9on wanted to make it a place where we could farm . 
  [ this is the morvan , in burgundy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/morvan_bourgogne2.jpg ) . 
  looks nice if you ask me, 
  yeah you 're right . 
  i forgot them because i did n't really like the but they 're also huge, 
  i 've never seen any of those . 
  we have something that looks like it , spirou et fantasio but it does n't look like they 're the same things, 
  the [ franco-belgian comics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-belgian_comics ) are the equivalent at least here in france , as most kids have read a ton of them . 
  the most famous imo are ast\u00e9rix , tintin , titeuf , lucky luke , marsupilami , iznogoud . 
  most teenagers know ( or used to know ? 
  i 'm getting old ) about [ lanfeust de troy ] ( http://www.askell.com/troy/lanfeust/personnagesc.jpg ) too , a sort of heroic fantasy comic series ( that also has a sequel , [ lanfeust des etoiles ] ( http://a397.idata.over-blog.com/600x450/2/89/06/71/arts-graphiques-xxe-xxie--2-/tarquin-lanfeust_etoiles.jpg ) , that is a sort of space opera ) . 
  by the way , france used to be ( and kinda still is ) a big country for science fiction . 
  you can also find many french superheroes comics , like [ fulguros ( 1947 ) ] ( http://pressibus.org/bd/polis/f/fulguros/fulgp4.png ) , [ l'archer blanc ( 1987 ) ] ( http://www.comicsovore.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/archer-blanc-1.jpg ) but they 're obviously less famous than the american ones . 
  young kinds also read a lot of mickey and donald comics , i 've heard somewhere that they almost do n't exist in the us . 
  they 're big here . 
  not so much . 
  i do n't know if people invest but i did n't talk about investing with anyone . 
  ** football ** is by far the most followed ( french ligue 1 and champions league mostly ) . 
  ** rugby union ** is a lot followed in the southern half of france ( french top 14 and various european cups mostly ) apart from that , i know people that follow ** nba ** , others that follow the ** handball ** or ** volleyball ** championships but they 're less watched . 
  handball is more watched when it 's our national team playing because we 're good at it . 
  tennis is a bit watched too ( mostly around the french open ) . 
  in the olympics we watch swimming/athletics/tennis / cycling . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ksaocih.jpg ) ( literal translation of america , fuck yeah ! ), 
  it 's still possible even for some young people . 
  but i have to admit that just last week i mistook an alsatian accent ( german border ) for a marseille accent ( mediterannean coast ) . 
  i 'm still pretty ashamed of it ^ ^ i ^ ^ was ^ ^ drunk ^ ^ though, 
  i 've never heard of any radio amateurs in france, 
  you 're probably right . 
  the thing is , we do n't even know how it is in all other european countries , so it 's impossible for americans ( or europeans for that matter ) to generalize anything on those topics, 
  yeah , i completely agree on the fact that they exist . 
  but most of them are almost no longer spoken compared to dialects in other countries , sadly . 
  are they really spoken by all generations though ? 
  i 've been in all those places and i 've never heard any of these dialects ( except chti , yeah verlan could be a dialect too , i agree ) . 
  i mean , if you compare these to dialects in german , it 's difficult to count ours as dialects , imo except old people , only different accents are spoken . 
  voralberg german and viennese german do n't even understand each other , and apart from chti which is as you said a mixture with flemish , everyone in france understands each other . 
  we do n't need to speak `` standard french '' when we 're speaking with someone with another region . 
  i read quickly , but what i want to say is that they do n't seem to realize that we are dozens of countries in europe . 
   whenever anyone says anything along the lines of `` america is actually fascist when compared to europe '' i get really angry . 
  it 's a bunch of 18 year olds trying to sound worldly without ever having been anywhere in the world or traveling in a bubble . 
  they do n't understand the rampant racism , classism , and xenophobia present not only in europe but in the test of the world . 
  this is correct . 
  we all have different kinds of racism , america is n't more `` fascist '' than `` europe '' . 
  all countries have different definitions for fascism/racism/xenophobia / etc. 
   in europe it was clear i 'd never be a european . 
  but i 'm now an american and nobody thinks otherwise the us is a country based on immigration . 
  it 's not the case in europe . 
  we do n't have the same culture with immigration . 
  it does n't mean that people will insult you and dislike you . 
  i 'm pretty sure if you live here long enough to get citizenship most people wo n't even know you 're an immigrant . 
   gay marriage ( central european countries only allow same-sex civil unions , not marriage , with eastern europe not recognizing same sex unions at all ) hmm yeah that 's because the supreme court said so . 
  we do n't have such a thing in europe , every country does as it pleases . 
  i 'm pretty sure if every state had to chose ( which was the case before the scotus ) gay mariage and abortion would n't be legal all over the us . 
   capital punishment ( which is also a bit misleading , because much of europe actually supports capital punishment , but due to the restrictive laws of the european union , capital punishment has been done away with by political elites ) 60 % of western europeans oppose it , 60 % of eastern europeans are in favor of it . 
  ^ ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/899 ) again , we are all very different countries . 
  really , it feels like this entire thread considers europe as one country comparable to the us . 
  and we all have different histories , spain is more catholic than france , so spain and france do n't have the same stances on abortion . 
  same for many other things . 
  [ so , lolcats are welsh ] ( http://65.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8v643hetv1r6l6x1o1_500.jpg ), 
  honestly though there 's almost no dialects in french . 
  everything has been standardized on parisian french . 
  you 'll find a few different words in different regions ( like a plastic bag can be named [ sac/poche/cornet / sachet/pochon ] ( https://francaisdenosregions.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/europe1_sachet_en_plastique.png ) ) and in the south they accentuate a bit differently when they speak . 
  it 's not really a dialect though , compared to other languages ' differencies, 
  where exactly are you going ? 
  i can probably name dozens of clubs and raves all over europe but you 'll got ta have to be more precise, 
  i was going to say paris is very dirty too . 
  but the dirtiest city you 've ever seen ? 
  i 'm surprised to hear that , i 've seen many cities dirtier than paris , in france and abroad, 
  i do n't know , it 's the same thing in french . 
  you can say black/white/arab , but yellow is racist . 
  at least try using `` asian '' or something like that, 
  you guys are so free you ca n't drink a beer in the streets if it 's not in a paper bag . 
  i envy you . 
  just answer the question dude . 
  i 'm curious , what are the arguments pro-no censorship at all ? 
  what is the point of being able to insult anyone freely ? 
  we 've done that in the past . 
  was n't that great, 
  yeah no thanks . 
  that 's just your opinion . 
  what 's the point in freely insulting others ? 
  we have freedom of speech , but not freedom to offend . 
  this means that i ca n't go out on french tv and say `` all jews are fucking thieves and they control all the banks '' . 
  the red line between `` offense '' and `` legal '' being determined by a judge . 
  some offensive things do n't get trouble , some others do . 
  you basically ca n't just insult , threaten or incite hatred against some people that are n't based on real facts . 
  like if i say `` most terrorists in the recent years have been muslims '' , nobody will give a fuck .
