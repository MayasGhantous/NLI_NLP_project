  i 've seen a few locks . 
  usually the door has a key , and often the key has been lost for a long time,

  around 1000 $ . 
  i live in paris, 
  my last name is a misspelling at the prefecture at the birth of my great grand father ( who did not speak french ) . 
  so we 're something like 30 in the world, 
  paris . 
  by far . 
  france edit : oh the british are pretty smug too, 
  i wo n't tease or mock someone who does n't drink . 
  but i ca n't understand why you would do that . 
  all the good drinks are alcoholic ones, 
  i own a tv for football/rugby games , watching movies and series on a big screen and playing on a console, 
  nah just answer \u00e7a va, 
  where did you go ? 
  the south-east is dirty imo . 
  and paris obviously but it 's a megalopolis . 
  you can often find named houses in france too, 
  is basically the same in french, 
  brittany too, 
  yeah and they do n't close very late during the week either, 
  yeah and they do n't close very late during the week either, 
  i 've never seen snails even on a restaurant menu . 
  cream , onion and lardons ( small pieces of ham ) . 
  without lardons it 's not carbonara for us, 
  [ this thread had a good amount of answers too if you 're curious ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4zbc6e/cool_national_parks_in_your_country/ ), 
   when is a child old enough to pick out their own clothes ? 
  12-13 i guess  fix their own food ? 
  my mom taught me and my brother at around 10 . 
  really depends on the family though ( and it 'll most often be very basic food )  play outside alone ? 
  nowadays i do n't know as parents seem very overprotective . 
  around 8 maybe for me  visit a friend 's house alone ? 
  8 too i guess  go to the shops alone ? 
  i used to buy bread when i was 8-10 already . 
  maybe even before . 
   ride transit ? 
  11-12 maybe . 
  really sometimes you do n't have a choice , when you live far from your school you got ta take the bus . 
  might even be younger for school bus  go to a friends house/the shops without asking ? 
  go to a friends house , at 8-10 i was definitely not asking for that . 
  i just said i 'd go play with some friends and not even care . 
  at 13 i defintely remember not even telling them before going outside . 
  to the shops without asking , same thing . 
   be in a relationship ? 
  15 maybe ? 
   be in a physically intimate relationship ? 
  17 or something i 'd say . 
   leave campus for lunch ? 
  that was n't allowed until high school . 
  then parents do n't care  go to the bathroom without asking ? 
  lol i have no idea about that . 
  i do n't remember asking for that  general freedom of movement ? 
  at 16 i 'd say parents would n't care about where you go as soon as you do n't get into trouble . 
  i mean in my region ( brittany , so it might be very different in other regions ) we 'd go out and drink every friday night in the nearby big city . 
  all high schoolers gather there , especially for the holidays , so there 's underage drinking everywhere . 
   do you feel children in your culture are given a shorter or a longer leash than others ? 
  well i do n't know , it 's hard to tell . 
  but i think we 're given quite a bit of freedom . 
  then again , it might have changed . 
  parents got paranoid in the last decades . 
  i have no idea what you guys are going through, 
  for a local election sure , but for the presidential election ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the 46 % of the french population who voted for mlp/ff/nda would not vote for a mulsim, 
  a muslim candidate would also have it tough, 
  yeah ... 33 years ago half of europe was under soviet rule, 
  with one big pickle you can have a shitton of one of the best tastes in the world ... only my mom likes those small ones . 
  it 's like you are n't eating anything at all, 
  did n't see that edit , my bad . 
  makes the question pretty boring, 
  kad merad was born in 1964 , algeria was independant, 
  marie curie maybe ? 
  well i ca n't say the opposite , it 's pretty much the same thing for me in brittany too . 
  we 're so incestuous that we have a way higher rate of legg -- calv\u00e9 -- perthes disease ( 6/1000 instead of a national average of 2/1000 ), 
  sure but even then . 
  people whose family had been living in marseille for millenia do n't have 100 % southern european or 100 % french . 
  yes , and as for the highway , anything with an engine volume  50 cm ^ 3 can drive on the highway . 
  they 're pretty ridiculous , noisy and make you look like a redneck though edit : cylindre volume ofc, 
  the best ones are the big ones, 
  obviously , but that 's true for pretty much everywhere in the word, 
   that our food is terrible . 
  i swear this is a myth we propagated so we could keep all our food to ourselves . 
  people are continuously surprised i can cook well , and that traditional british food does n't taste like wallpaper ( when cooked well ) . 
  i mean i have a friend that lived in the uk for a few years , everytime he was invited somewhere and his hosts said they cooked a nice dinner , it was green beans with an overcooked roast beef,

  there 's / r/travel for tourism related questions, 
  i always thought the least populated d\u00e9partement was creuse ... 
  damn loz\u00e8re has 15 inhabitants/km \u00b2 , that 's about the same as argentina ( less than new mexico ), 
  damn i was writing the same thing , my pc crashed but someone still posted it in under 5 minutes after the thread was posted ... 
  i guess i 've been a few times in the [ creuse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creuse ) d\u00e9partement . 
  it 's in the middle of france and the biggest town has 14k inhabitants . 
  it has 22 inhabitants/km \u00b2 which is the same as arkansas , oklahoma or sweden, 
  yeah we 're pretty much the same as everyone else on that point . 
  i mean you might have a few booty calls but that 's about it . 
  cheating on your partner is still bad, 
  we do n't care much about it . 
  it 's basically the us state where a lot of sitcoms used to spend a couple episodes . 
  i love napoleonic times . 
  they basically created nation states and the way countries work nowadays, 
  yeah well i do n't think that 's the reason people downvoted this post .
