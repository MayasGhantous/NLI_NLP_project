  if you say `` all muslims just want to watch the western world burn and install an global emirate '' , well you 'll get sued and probably lose . 
  i like it that way . 
  unjustified insults or political arguments are useless and just lead to more hatred between various groups . 
  we lost against you something like 29-18 . 
  we have n't been that good in the recent years ... 
  you 're scottish ? 
  because we finished 5th in the last 6 nations ... you were 4th :( thank god whoever invited italy, 
  wow , a brit speaking french . 
  well yeah i guess we 're neighbours now . 
  thanks for giving us rugby !, 
  [ and now you ruined my evening for making me watch this again :( ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i3s3gtnnuq ), 
  it 's so weird , every country knows about aliz\u00e9e and says she 's super hot . 
  she was a famous pop singer like almost ten years ago . 
  fine , you can have her . 
  if you admit that materazzi was an asshole, 
  haha i did n't understand everything but that was pretty funny . 
  [ we have the music `` coup de boule '' ( headbutt ) about that event ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7sx2wrjpeo ), 
  france here . 
  so our neighbours ... ** spain ** - cool guys , nice place for vacations . 
  awesome food . 
  very loud and speak way too fast though . 
  but we like you guys , a majority of high school students learn spanish now . 
  ** italy ** - thanks for playing rugby , guys . 
  ** switzerland ** - very clean cities guys , but why does everything has to be so fucking expensive ? 
  cool chocolate though ** germany ** - hey buddies !, 
  good think we overcame all the past , uh ? 
  you guys have cool music and cool beer festivals , so why did we even fight for decades in the past ? 
  ** belgium ** - good beer , good chocolate , and thanks for inventing the `` french '' fries . 
  it 's probably the first country i support in sports after france . 
  ** uk ** - because otherwise they have almost no neighbours . 
  well , that 's the uk . 
  thanks for sending us your elders on vacation i guess, 
  we gave you a cool looking flag and a republic though !, 
  every touristic city has its scams unfortunately . 
  in paris the most annoying one is the petition girls scam . 
  they make you try to sign something and sometimes someone else steals your stuff while you 're distracted . 
  [ here 's a better description ] ( https://www.corporatetravelsafety.com/safety-tips/deaf-mute-scams-in-europe/ ), 
   ** france ... ** the best thing about it is that there 's a rather conveniently-placed mountain range between us . 
  wow , that 's the first time i agree with one of you world cup thieves !, 
  yep i highly recommand going to the delirium caf\u00e9 , it 's a really coor bar, 
  meh , there 's enough stuff to see for like one afternoon . 
  in terms of quality , yeah there 's some really good-looking stuff , but in terms of quantity ... 
  most big cities in europe have twice the number of things to see . 
  in terms of quantity , brussels is similar to bratislava imo, 
  well , yeah berlin was pretty nice but we stayed there for like one day , i really want to go back there . 
  living in a village was nice because i learned a lot about rural life in poland . 
  a lot of really weird or creepy things though , like when i put on my seatbelt in the car they laughed at me while they drove very fast on dirt roads . 
  they were really generous people though , always offering me food or everything to be sure i do n't lack anything . 
  also the first time i went to church on a sunday was there . 
  poznan was really beautiful , poland is high on my list of countries to visit . 
  a small town near poznan, 
  a couple hundred euros for like 5-6 days everytime . 
  it 's not inexpensive , but it 's an okay price for something that 's going to be really fun and interesting . 
  well ... 
  i found one native girl when traveling solo ... 
  seriously though , if you really want to find natives and chat with them , do n't stay in the touristic districts . 
  in those places people do n't have the time for you , and they see dozens of people like you every day . 
  go to more hidden restaurants and go to local clubs and bars instead of going to the most famous ones ( well , if they 're famous you should at least see how it is once , but do n't go there all the time ) . 
  and try to learn a few sentences before going !, 
  you can also directly ask the friendly natives , it will make them like you more, 
  0.50 l of soda is plenty enough for me . 
  if i had more i 'd just throw it away . 
  it 's not like sodas are good in fast food joints ... 
  i travelled with my parents to neighboring countries , it was nice . 
  in middle school i went to berlin , then poland by bus for a school exchange , that was interesting to learn about other countries cultures . 
  continued to travel with some friends , and now i 'm working for 6 months in austria . 
  best way to learn about other ways of living . 
  it definitely makes you reconsider many things about your own country . 
  i also travelled solo to prague , and it was one of the best places i 've been . 
  i met many very cool guys in a hostel , went out like crazy . 
  now travelling is what i want to do everytime i 'll have a few weeks work free, 
  i do n't have any problems with muslims whose beliefs stay in their private life . 
  what about the french operation in mali ? 
  it was not an agressive operation , the goal was to protect the democratically elected government of mali to not be destroyed by islamist rebels . 
  i 'm really curious about other countries ' stances on this . 
  i agree that some operations like in lybia were stupid , but many french operations were justified . 
  i do n't want a european army that wo n't protect other weak democracies around the world, 
  you can also ask on / r/travel . 
  do you want the sea nearby ? 
  what month are you travelling ? 
  yep . 
  he created the fn with various collaborationists ( vichy france supporters ) though . 
  but even if the people who say that are fn supporters and i hate to agree with them , they are way less extreme now than they used to be . 
  the fn nowadays is a very modern populist nationalist party , even though a lot of their politicians like to remind us sometimes of the disgusting thoughts some of them have . 
  yeah maybe . 
  still kind of idiotic to think that we all agree on that . 
  hahaha . 
  yeah just because populists say it 's easy to avoid attacks does n't mean they actually have solutions, 
  / r/le _ pen have fun, 
  come on , i do n't like the fn but this is ridiculous too . 
  i think they have plenty enough of bad ideas and arguments to be mocked rather than comparing them to something vastly different . 
  you said yes to 69 % of the existing words . 
  you said yes to 3 % of the nonwords . 
  this gives you a corrected score of 69 % - 3 % = 66 % . 
  i did n't help, 
  i do n't see any reason where you could n't do that , but i guess if you want to be sure about it you 'd have to directly ask amazon, 
  because in most discussions american redditors automatically assume that everyone is from the us . 
  some even assume that every western country has similar laws , like i just saw in the / r/worldnews thread about ban of burkinis in some french cities some american guy arguing that these bans were illegal using the us constitution . . [ right here if you 're interested ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4y31t7/three_more_towns_in_france_to_join_burkini_ban/d6kqy7j ),
