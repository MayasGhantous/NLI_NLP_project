  what about lund ? 
  not that i 've been there but i 've heard of it as a nice city, 
  it took me many years just to visit all the d\u00e9partements of metropolitan france ( mainland + corsica ) . 
  and i 've probably not yet seen everything in france . 
  though i hope i can say i 've experienced france . 
  i mean , it depends on how you define `` experiencing europe '' . 
  imo if you travel for a few months in cities and rural europe , or better , if you work for a few months in a country , you 've experienced one country . 
  i 've been in like 10 or 12 european countries , i definitely ca n't say i 've experienced all of europe because i 'm lacking some regions of europe ( baltics , scandinavia , balkans and british isles ) . 
  if you go through many countries and do n't just stay for one day in a capital city , imo , you can say you 've experienced europe . 
  i do n't know anyone who watches star trek but maybe older people do . 
  i would n't say it 's big in france, 
  we have the exact same joke in france, 
  funny because i ca n't think of any jokes against italians !, 
  in france we have those jokes about belgians saying they 're stupid . 
  -- a belgian is sitting in a caf\u00e9 , he asks the waiter . 
  - waiter , can i have some sugar ? 
  - i already gave you ten sugar cubes !, 
  - well it 's not my fault if they always dissolve ... -- how to make a belgian busy for hours ? 
  read the answer below how to make a belgian busy for hours ? 
  read the answer above -- bus accident in belgium , 40 casualties . 
  20 in the accident , 20 in the reconstitution . 
  yeah i always love when some americans on reddit say that europe is basically iraq , and when you say that you actually live there , they answer `` duh , your opinion does n't matter , i 'm talking about facts '', 
  depends how you define diversity . 
  by languages , yeah , i guess every country has populations of foreign origin , [ here 's an article describing all those languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_france ) . 
  tldr : we have more people speaking berber than people living in your state, 
  they want to divide , yes , but they are definitely using their own twisted version of islam . 
  there 's no one version of islam like there 's no one version of christianity, 
  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cosc9cjviaa-g5m.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cosc9_mviaiqsws.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cosc92wumaazdy2.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cosc9eevyaa8yeu.jpg this comes from dabiq , isis 's news magazine they literally say that even if we stop bombing they 'll keep attacking ( in the last picture , but the entire article is both creepy and interesting ), 
  i do n't have an answer for you , but you can also ask this on / r/travel if you want, 
   we 're also a target because we 're involved on the ground and in the air fighting aqmi and bombing daesh . 
  meh , it 's just that people tend to attack in the cities and countries they 're familiar with . 
  they already speak the language ( as they grew up here ) so that 's easier for them . 
  we keep saying that but i do n't think that 's the reason ( even the isis news agency published an article saying `` even if you stop bombing us , we will still attack you as long as you do n't convert to islam '' ), 
  bigger population ( france is 4 times the population of netherlands ) , bigger amount of population from foreign origin , lack of integration belgium was sadly an accident , because they arrested a guy the day before and they feared they would get caught , their initial plan was to attack france again, 
  i just find it hilarious how in every single thread on / r/askeurope he manages to disagree with the entire subreddit and call everyone a troll . 
  every . 
  single . 
  day . 
  we use a lot of messenger with my friends . 
  some people use whatsapp but i do n't think it 's as frequent, 
  [ breton galette ] ( http://www.galette-cafe.fr/img/carousel/bigimage23-1400x1070.jpg ) obviously, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/countries_of_the_united_kingdom why do n't you answer to that ? 
  do you have any arguments against a [ uk government website ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/administrative/the-countries-of-the-uk/index.html ) too ? 
  because i already commented twice to show you a wikipedia page showing that you 're wrong but you did n't answer , so here i am , commenting on a very low comment that nobody else than you will see . 
  please explain me how scotland is n't a country . 
  oh i completely agree with that , i just wanted to say that 's not a description of the city but of its surroundings . 
  most students just stay in the middle of the city or just travel directly by train to other cities for tourism, 
  good thing to know !, 
  thanks, 
  that 's not exactly a good description , because lille is actually one of the best cities for a student in most french rankings , and yeah the region is a bit poor because it 's a former industrial region but when you 're a student in the city you do n't need to visit the entire area . 
  a similar question : are n't adapters enough for the voltage and frequence ? 
  there are tons and tons of students in that city , and you 'll be very close to other countries ( belgium , luxembourg , germany and netherlands ) . 
  the city is very beautiful too i think , but i do n't know enough about it so that 's all i can say . 
  maybe someone else can say more things, 
  a year my bad haha, 
  i 'll graduate in a few months , but i do n't have any debt ( my school costed me 800 $ a year which my parents paid for , along with an apartment and some necessary money ) . 
  some poorer students do n't pay any fees to get in the school , and some even get paid . 
  we 'll see what my career is like in a few months !, 
  average for a person in my job sector is 36k $ / year for someone who just graduated , and i wo n't buy my own appartment/house until a few years or a car until i really need one ( = if i do n't live in paris ) . 
  standard in france i 'd say would be some mainstream edm , in like 90 % of night clubs then i think the rest of night clubs consist of house music and techno ( well , i do n't know if that 's true , it 's just where i usually go ) . 
  hah , thanks for making me notice this . 
  that 's cute, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom  the uk consists of four countries : england , scotland , wales , and northern ireland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom  the uk consists of four countries : england , scotland , wales , and northern ireland . 
  no , he 's not trolling . 
  just look at his comment history , it 's a fun , but infuriating reading, 
  yeah that guy just hates whenever you bring up countries into the discussion . 
  he calls everyone a nationalist , do n't worry, 
  we took [ couscous ] ( http://icu.linter.fr/750/373832/9595011060/couscous-royal-marocain.jpg ) from our north african colonies . 
  i even think it 's the favorite meal for french people ( i 've heard it a lot , my bad if it 's not true ), 
  [ well we kind of did , but then again i think your military right now would be easier to deal with than 100 years ago ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/western_germany_1923_de.png ), 
  it 's okay we 'll just take rheinland, 
  yeah you 're correct . 
  yep . 
  fellow europeans are just scared of us and our mighty country, 
  white flag surrender monkey, 
  the first one was probably sarcastic . 
  ignore him , he 's an arrogant dude that thinks he knows everything better than others . 
  student meals are n't free in france for example, 
  there 's so much dog poop ... 
  i 've been to vienna and prague and both are way cleaner than most french cities, 
  i 'll never respect you guys in football . 
  but thanks for trying to play rugby , at least we 're not last in the 6 nations,

  a charger is like 10 $ -15 $ , you 'll have more chance than just hoping that hotels have usb ports . 
  i 'm curious , how many days does this tour take ? 
  in what category ? 
  because the big attacks recently are not due to the recent migrants but to the lack of integration of 60 's immigration, 
  well clearly nobody and nothing i say can change your mind . 
  have a nice day, 
  yeah , athletes are n't paid , but i mean i was in a school that did very good in recent years tournament , and for the best teams , the coaches were simply our gym teachers , except in rugby , where it was an amateur rugby player not paid much . 
  not random things though , they 're talking about the original thread . 
  look , that 's the point of the subreddit , deal with it . 
  no , europe is not more arrogant than the us , the us does n't have more or less idiots . 
  if you hate a subreddit , do n't visit it , every subreddit has a part of kids that think they 're smarter than everyone else . 
  it 's not really butthole , but it 's not really butt either ... maybe ass ... `` to have some ass '' ( avoir du cul ) often means being lucky . 
  this is not really what a kid would say though , no , it 's more of an adult saying . 
  i 've heard my parents say it a lot , i might say it from time to time , but we use various expressions ( to have some ass , to be a cuckold are some of these . 
  being a cuckold means being lucky because of another expression i think : `` bad luck in games , luck in love '' ), 
  like i said , we have some idiots , you have idiots .
