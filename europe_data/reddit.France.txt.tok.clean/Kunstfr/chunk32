  every country has idiots . 
  just ignore these guys like we ignore yours . 
  you can even make fun of us on / r/shiteuropeanssay if you want, 
  yeah you misunderstood that comment i wrote . 
  replace `` real '' by `` proper '' if you want . 
  we have universities like you have in the us , but we also have what we call grandes ecoles = big schools . 
  it 's just hard to explain , and my english is n't perfect , sorry . 
  did you read the thread about norway prisons ? 
  most people are n't happy about it . 
  [ also , i even defended the us there bro ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vxmta/why_norways_prison_system_is_so_successful/d62cypk ), 
  you 're welcome to check / r/shitamericanssay buddy, 
  you have the same people in the us that keep saying the us of a are the best country on earth . 
  what 's your point ? 
  rugby union is really one of our most important sports . 
  in southern france , especially in the south-west , it 's more important than football . 
  however in the northern half of france it 's almost non existant ( apart from paris ), 
  foutre le camp !, 
  haha, 
  foutre is also a synonym for cum in french . 
  but yeah we do n't use it as `` to fuck '', 
  foutre is familiar language for faire ( to do ) , `` rien foutre '' means `` to do nothing '' !, 
  `` s'en foutre '' would mean `` to not care '' too, 
  well we do have handball , volleyball , and basketball . 
  and we 're pretty good at these, 
  wow this is the reason my high school german is useless in austria . 
  what dialect is that ? 
  * we did n't breed pigs together !, 
  * = who do you think you are to be so impolite ? 
  avoir le cul bord\u00e9 de nouilles * to have one 's butthole surrounded by noodles * = to be lucky s'en foutre comme de sa premi\u00e8re chemise * to care about something like you care about your first shirt * = to not give a fuck, 
  http://www.voyages-sncf.com/ apparently at 7:20 a train is leaving barcelona and it arrives in paris at 15:01 , but there are n't many seats left . 
  the price is between 150 $ and 200 $ per seat or 09:23 - 15:53 which appears to have more seats as i 'm typing, 
  [ result of the second turn of the 2012 presidential elections ( pink : socialist party , blue : right-wing union for a popular movement ) ] ( http://www.cartesfrance.fr/cartes/carte-election-presidentielle-2012.jpg ) . 
  [ result of the first turn 2015 regional elections ( dark blue : national front , red : communists , lighter pink is left-wing but not socialist party , light blue is right-wing but not ump ) ] ( http://www.cartesfrance.fr/cartes/geographie/carte-elections-departementales-2015-premier-tour-grand-format.jpg ) so the socialist party has always ( at least in the last decades ) been strong in brittany , corsica and south-western france , and the national front is really strong in northern france bordering belgium ( former coal mining region , with now a lot of unemployment ) and south-eastern france ( around nice particularly , it 's a conservative region ) . 
  the right-wing is strong in south-eastern france , vend\u00e9e , and alsace . 
  in the countryside people tend to vote more right-wing , and in the recent years , far-right because they feel abandoned by recent governments . 
  note the communists in the middle of france , i do n't know the reason behind this, 
  [ we have a lot of symbols ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbols_of_france )  the national emblems of the french fifth republic are :  the french tricolour  the national anthem : `` la marseillaise ''  marianne , the allegoric figure of the french republic  the official motto : libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 ( liberty , equality , fraternity )  the great seal of france  other symbols include :  the national order of the legion of honour and the national order of merit  bastille day , the french national holiday celebrated on july 14  the capital letters `` rf '' , standing for `` r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise '' ( french republic )  the gallic rooster, 
  we do n't . 
  kids play football here . 
  okay so in france we have real universities and schools . 
  in both cases , you have ( what we call ) university teams , with a national university championship . 
  however , you do n't support much your team . 
  now , in the case of schools , you have a lot more organization of your student life with various student offices managing the social life of the school . 
  thus we have many tournaments between schools organized every year ( challenge lyon for example ) . 
  there 's also another thing . 
  many schools are part of a network : for example polytech is one school network with many schools all accross france . 
  there are many such networks , and usually you can find a big sports tournament for that network . 
  for example , the `` centrale '' network of schools has the `` intercentrales tournament '' . 
  there you can find a lot of fervour . 
  it 's very far from how it is in the us , but it 's still important . 
  some schools hate each other , every school has various chants , well , it 's all fun . 
  but it 's still amateur sports . 
  in north-western france ( brittany specifically ) it almost never gets below 0 , on average the minimum is 4 \u00b0 c , the maximum average is like 10 \u00b0 c. 
  the coldest temperature i 've ever experienced must be around -5 \u00b0 c or something, 
  france : officially the [ rooster ] ( http://gollnisch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/coq-gaulois-bis.jpg ) , unofficially baguettes, 
  in france i 'm not sure there are standardized lists of books to read , at least in medium and high school . 
  we have different kinds of litterature almost everybody reads : ancient greek stories and tragedies ( homer 's odyssey , etc ) ; classical french theatre plays ( moli\u00e8re 's the imaginary invalid for example ) ; some poetry ( guillaume apollinaire 's alcools , jacques pr\u00e9vert 's paroles for example ) ; and many french books ( like victor hugo 's les mis\u00e9rables , gustave flobert 's madame bovary , voltaire 's candide , guy de maupassant 's bel-ami , albert camus ' the stranger etc ) . 
  that 's in `` french '' litterature lessons . 
  we also have in high school philosophy lessons . 
  there we read some french classical philosophy ( charles baudelaire 's les fleurs du mal , pascal 's pens\u00e9es etc ) . 
  so yeah , mostly french litterature with a few notable ancient greek books . 
  good to know then , i 'm going to czechia from austria this week, 
  north-western france , it 's on average around 25 \u00b0 c when the weather is nice in the summer . 
  but sometimes it can go up to 30 \u00b0 c , and it was 40 \u00b0 c for one day and 35 \u00b0 c the rest of the week last year . 
  in the southern half of france it 's way more frequent to have 30 \u00b0 c. 
  i 'm in vienna , austria right now and it 's around 20 \u00b0 c during the night , 30 \u00b0 c during the day with a peak at 32 \u00b0 c. 
  that 's one reason why we do n't have ac compared to you guys !, 
  in the morning ? 
  at what border did they check your id ? 
  i 'm curious , i have n't seen any border control and i 've crossed maybe 6-7 borders this year, 
  as op is going with his family , i 'd heavily recommand at least one of those three days in arcachon , the beaches are nice . 
  i did though . 
  i have to admit you 're really good at this trolling . 
  have a nice evening dude, 
  can you show me a source showing the economic power of jews in france ? 
  you would then win the debate , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_france read this . 
  they did n't have normal rights until the xixth century but antisemitism remained present . 
  read all of this , then please tell me how jews were powerful in france quick edit : oh , you 're the guy that always uses `` o_o '' . 
  i remember you from an older pseudo-debate ... 
   are there any ` elite ' ethnic groups in your country ? 
   do any of them still exist ? 
  i take op 's question as `` is there currently any `` elite '' ethnic group in your country '' . 
   second , jews where a powerfull economic group throughout history . 
  jews have always been dominated and disliked all over europe for this . 
  i encourage you to read voltaire 's candide which gives you an idea on how jew bankers were seen ( spoiler : they were seen as assholes ) . 
  i also showed you a very important story in france , the dreyfus affair , which shows in great detail how jews were discriminated just over a century ago . 
   and you do n't show data to disprove something , you show data to prove something . 
  i can also say `` muslims have always been the major power in france '' , which is obviously not true . 
  now ** you ** have to disprove that with sources . 
  that 's what you 're asking me right now . 
  now , you do n't have to answer , i wo n't . 
  you do n't have any arguments and you wo n't answer mine . 
  have a great day, 
  op asks for current ethnic groups disproportionnally rich and/or powerful . 
  jews really do n't fall in that description . 
  historically , jews * might * have been proportionnally richer than the rest of the population , just like in the rest of europe , because christians were not allowed to manipulate money . 
  but jews have never been in a strong position of power in france ( see the [ dreyfus affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dreyfus_affair ) ) . 
  and you do n't show data to disprove something , you show data to prove something . 
  classical stereotypes against jews .
