  well , that escalated quickly, 
  russia visits many eu countries and nato members every year ... 
  if you do n't piss at full power on the top of the chinaware it goes straight down . 
  i never had any problem with that anyway, 
   dance around the tree that 's original . 
  other than that i think it 's also like this in most families in france ( apart from really catholic ones maybe ... ), 
  peeing directly in the water is weird though . 
  it goes everywhere and it 's loud . 
  piss on the chinaware, 
  are you a dual national ? 
  your french is way too good, 
  why should they live in the country they want ? 
  1,2 million people is a lot . 
  we should put them everywhere we can . 
  yeah sure let 's find some random arguments . 
  oh by the way , the countries that have the most asylum requests in the eu are sweden , germany , hungary and austria . 
  uk and france , who made those borders , do n't have a lot of refugees ( uk being an island helps a lot ) . 
  what did these countries do to have so many refugees ?

  the bombing missions on this terrorist organization actually started * after * we had terrorist attacks . 
  i 'll edit my comment then . 
  it 's still almost nothing , why should we have 100 times more refugees than you just because we 're closer geographically ? 
  800 is really not a lot . 
  that 's 16 refugees per million south korean inhabitants ( i 'm supposing you 're from sk ) . 
  the eu got 1.200.000 requests for asylum , which makes 2361 refugees per million eu inhabitants . 
  and that 's ignoring all the refugees who did n't request asylum for various reasons, 
  a lot of north korean refugees , when they flee their country , go to the us or japan, 
  - what is your favorite football club ? 
  stade rennais fc - how many games do you go to per year ? 
  i have n't been there in a while , i 've been living in another city for the last 5 years ... 
  i try to go at least 4 times every year - do you have a favorite supporter chant ? 
  ( please translate it if it 's not in french of spanish ) . 
  does your team or fanbase have any unique traditions ? 
  yeah sorry i 'm not enough of a fan for that - how heated is your biggest rivalry ? 
  would you feel safe wearing your team 's jersey alone in your rival team 's city/territory ? 
  what about in their stadium ( outside the designated visiting fan section ) ? 
  is football ` hooligan ' culture a big problem in your country ? 
  fc nantes probably . 
  they are bad nowadays anyway . 
  [ 4-1 you losers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umkzcbj8s8g ) !, 
  [ you even left at half-time ] ( http://www.tribune-nantaise.fr/img/articles/fcnantes-des-nantais-ont-quitte-le-stade-prematurement-2033303071.jpg ) !, 
  there 's not * so much * violence in france . 
  you 'd be fine with any jersey ( except maybe the psg jersey in marseille ) - for those who support mid and low-finishing teams : do you get sick of seeing the same 2-3 teams win your country 's title every year ? 
  do fans celebrate things like getting 6th place ( or not getting relegated ) if their team normally does much worse ? 
  we are pretty stable around the 8th position . 
  every year , we are nearly perfect for like 10 games . 
  everybody thinks this is our year . 
  then we lose everything . 
  in the end we just win enough games to be better than nantes, 
  i 'll edit my comment then, 
  around my parents ' house i can find [ some manors worth 2 million euros ] ( http://proprietes.lefigaro.fr/annonces/propriete-ille+et+vilaine-bretagne-france/161364-3/ ) and [ some others that do n't show the price ] ( http://www.demeuresdulittoral.com/acheter-immobilier/gro280-exceptionnel-domaine ) . 
  it 's always very close to the sea . 
  these are worth a few million euros . 
  there 's probably way more expensive but you do n't find those with a quick google search, 
  i 've never heard of anyone wrestling or watching that sport in my life, 
  it 's really not that popular in france . 
  we just know s\u00e9bastien loeb, 
  real city . 
  i know it from europa universalis though, 
  [ it 's only in movies and series ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1lyf9q/why_do_most_characters_just_hang_up_the_phone/ ), 
  usa : boston , montpelier , new york , washington dc , philadelphia , atlanta , miami , orlando , new orleans , louisville , lafayette , chicago , detroit , denver , houston , dallas , austin , nashville , minneapolis , indianapolis , kansas city , las vegas , los angeles , san francisco , san diego , seattle , portland , salt lake city , honolulu , anchorage , des moines , albuquerque canada : montr\u00e9al , qu\u00e9bec , vancouver , ottawa , toronto , moose factory, 
  our beer is crap , that 's why we have a lot of belgian beer . 
  in northern france you can find some good beers though . 
  you would n't say france does better food ? 
  i mean , yeah , you have nice desserts ... and imo bistros and caf\u00e9s are really expensive in france . 
  being in austria right now , all restaurants seem way cheaper . 
  hehe i just drank a radler yesterday . 
  wieselburger , noted !, 
  i have to try it then !, 
  it might depend on the city , but everytime i go to spain , shops are closed from midday to 2 pm ... 
  i 'd say it 's nice for one day , not more ( the old town and the castle are really nice , but most of the city is soviet-style ), 
  i do n't see that many budweisers in austria ( vienna ) . 
  i see a lot of ottakringer , stiegl , zipfer though !, 
  i like belgian beers because they have a real taste , and they 're stronger . 
  i feel like a lot of beers in germany , england and austria are very light ( beers i 've tasted , not saying that all beers from these countries are too light or that ther countries do n't have light beers ) . 
  ridiculous . 
  quatre-vingt dix-huit is perfect, 
  yeah i think german is easier for people whose monthertongue is n't a romance or germanic language because almost everybody learns english . 
  learn the one that seems the most useful . 
  chose well , one of those two languages is the official language of three countries , the other one is going to be the most spoken language on the planet in a few decades , is the language of love and does n't have a bad historical stereotype behind it . 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke , ^ ^ just ^ ^ in ^ ^ case, 
  german is easier when you speak a germanic language already . 
  french is easier when you speak a romance language already . 
  no degree should be a problem in many places . 
  i only know austria enough to say : this is a fucking great country to live in . 
  france here . 
  i usually have my id card and my driver 's license ( student card does n't prove id here ) . 
  i often have my passport whenever i 'm abroad too . 
  i almost never use any of those . 
  maybe once a year for the driver 's license . 
  nobody asks for my id to buy alcohol or cigarettes . 
  hehehe nonante . 
  it sounds funny, 
  can confirm :(, 
  wait pim pam pum is international ? 
  i might have done this in the last year , so it did n't disappear, 
  i have a similar game . 
  you say `` x , you drink '' . 
  then you and x toast , and drink . 
  it 's called `` tu bois '' ( = `` you drink '' ),
