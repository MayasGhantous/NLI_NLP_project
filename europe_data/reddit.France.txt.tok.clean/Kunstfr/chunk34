  this is a war against an ideology from outside europe . 
  in the us gun criminality is mostly from inside ( with a fair share of mentally ill people ), 
  dude you are crazy . 
  the situations are completely different . 
  do n't try to predict things when you do n't see the big picture . 
  you 're being ridiculous . 
  western european countries are probably the countries that are the most peaceful toward each other . 
  there wo n't be a war in 7 years , and there 's absolutely no reason whatsoever for this . 
  exclaves are not a problem as we do n't have borders for now . 
  there 's no territorial claim in belgium , wtf are you talking about ? 
  france , netherlands and germany all consider it as a completely independant country . 
  however , if they ever want to break into the three pieces corresponding to their language , yeah , they 'd be welcome in all those three countries . 
  but nobody claims anything there ... why 7 years , what weird thing do you think is gon na happen in 7 years ? 
  ask a nationalist if you want , you wo n't find any that hates the british for dunkirk and the german for ww2 ... 
  this nationalism does n't exist anymore ... nobody cares about territorial claims in western europe anymore ... and yeah if you want , in 20 years if you prefer . 
  germany is our closest friend in europe, 
  you really do n't know anything about our politics and our we view our history , trust me , nobody cares about all the backstabbings and everything . 
  germany is probably our best friend in europe , that 's all we see . 
  we know what happened when nazis were in control , but things have changed since then . 
  water under the bridge . 
  everything 's cool now . 
  she does n't care about this . 
  she does n't like immigration , she 's not a nationalist like one of the 30 's, 
  sure ... 
  it 's not like i probably know a hundred times more french people than you do ... 
  yeah and we 're fine with it now . 
  some companies do . 
  45 min is just what the law requires, 
  i do n't want to have a little sandwich in front of my computer at work . 
  in france the employer has to authorize you a lunchbreak of 45 minutes minimum . 
  i like it . 
  it 's way healthier to have a normal meal and to take some time to think about other things than work . 
  better than that . 
  i 'm the legendary frenchman who does n't live in his own country . 
  i 'm in a place where they do n't even speak french !, 
  cool then . 
  i 'm not in my country as we speak though, 
  i live in a building from the 80 's and work in a building that must not be more than 15 years old . 
  even though we have a lot of old buildings , most people live and work in recent buildings, 
  it 's just a joke because you 're our neighbours . 
  you 're probably our favorite foreigners because of the language, 
  we have a pretty heavy bureaucracy in france too . 
  yeah , we have a lot of racism , but from our point of view there 's really a huge difference between black people and white people in the us . 
  it 's crazy to hear how many times a white cop shot a black guy in the recent years . 
   this one i can answer in two words : `` american dream '' . 
  the idea that in america you should be massively successful off your own hard work and determination . 
  so ... to ensure people deserve what happens to them , you make people pay a ton of money for education ? 
  it does n't really make sense . 
  if you want hard word and dedication to be rewarded , then everybody should start from the same point . 
  so he 's the minister of economy and tries to campain for himself recently . 
  he 's still under hollande in the polls for now , and he 's not left wing enough to get support from the socialist party, 
  that 's a truck , buddy, 
  i 've been there twice , i have to admit there 's a lot of drug dealers . 
  other than that never had a problem, 
  in france we joke about them by saying they 're dumb . 
  like `` what 's written on top of belgian ladders ? 
  stop ! '', 
  come on , we know you guys love us . 
  that 's a pretty unique dream . 
  where is she going in spain ? 
  no , students that need one will just use a public one . 
  we do n't have `` american restaurants '' like we have `` lebanese restaurants '' or `` chinese restaurants '' . 
  when we talk about american food , we talk about junk food or like a burger restaurant . 
   contracting an infectious disease after a suspect spat in their mouth dear god, 
  sure but we wanted to compare rape between different countries and we have no other way but to take directly the countries statistics, 
  you wanted a source , but if you consider any source as inaccurate , then you wo n't ever be wrong, 
  mostly jupp\u00e9 though . 
  and i do n't think jupp\u00e9 is part of that droite d\u00e9complex\u00e9e . 
  nice !, 
  i 've always loved how she criticizes the establishment and the bourgeoisie in politics , while she grew up in neuilly-sur-seine ( one of the richest cities in france if not the richest ) , she 's a lawyer , etc, 
  what exactly do you mean by go france ? 
  i do n't listen to any podcast , but just for the precision : or you asking for english podcasts or any language ? 
  russia is really seen as a good example for a big part of the right wing + far right . 
  it might be because it manages to be a powerful country while not being aligned with the us , which is something many french politicians dream of since the end of ww2, 
  that 's like thinking comics are as important in france ( europe ? ) . 
  i 've never even seen a marvel/dc comic book . 
  aside from batman and superman superheroes are completely unknown until they are in a movie . 
  in france we have paris games week , japan expo that are really big . 
  i do n't really know any others . 
  in france we now have [ 13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/france_base_map_18_regions.png/400px-france_base_map_18_regions.png ) . 
  they 're not really autonomous . 
  i had to look up the info because nobody really knows what they do . 
  so they manage non-urban transport networks , garbage , the building and upkeep of high schools , development of ports and airports . 
  each region has some departments . 
  we have [ 101 departments in france ( the 5 overseas regions are 5 departments ] ( http://e-sushi.fr/imagearticle/2016/01/2000px-france_maximale.svg_.png ) . 
  they manage the building and upkeep of medium school ( is that the word ? 
  ) , welfare , transport of handicaped kids . 
  anyway , i just said a few actions they are responsible of . 
  the thing is , france is very very centralized country . 
  all the powers are in paris . 
  quick edit : we have some overseas collectivites ( st pierre et miquelon , st mrtin , st barthelemy , wallis-et-futuna and french polynesia that have more autonomy , but i think it depends on which one we 're talking about . ), 
  we also have a overseas territory , the french southern and antartic lands , near the south pole, 
  most probably yeah . 
  they say  temperature between 0 \u00b0 c et 16 \u00b0 c : 66 %  temperature between 16 \u00b0 c et 32 \u00b0 c : 34 %  average temperature : 8 \u00b0 c, 
  do you have a degree for that ? 
  sweden in may : 41 % rain , 12 \u00b0 c on average ( 53f ) sweden in june : 45 % rain , 14 \u00b0 c on average ( 57f ) ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.quandpartir.com/meteo/suede-idpaysmois-77-5.html ) uk in may : 64 % rain , 8 \u00b0 c on average ( 46f ) uk in june : 66 % rain , 12 \u00b0 c on average ( 53f ) ^ [ 2 ] ( http://www.quandpartir.com/meteo/royaume-uni-idpaysmois-52-5.html ) italy in may : 24 % rain , 14 \u00b0 c on average ( 57f ) italy in june : 14 % rain , 22 \u00b0 c on average ( 71f ) ^ [ 3 ] ( http://www.quandpartir.com/meteo/italie-idpaysmois-67-5.html ) it 's not `` in case of bad weather '' in that case !, 
  really try to plan ahead , and if the climate is bad in a country ( sorry , uk ) , try to go there in june rather than in may . 
  well if you 're doing a trip , you might for example want to stay in the same climate . 
  i do n't know how it is in all these countries , but one thing i 'm certain is that between rome , london and stockholm , you might need very different clothes . 
  you could want to do a western-mediterranean trip , like spain-france-italy even switzerland , it 's not that far .
