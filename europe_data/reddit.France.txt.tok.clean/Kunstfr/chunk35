  you could also do a central europe trip ( like northern italy or northern balkans start-vienna-budapest-prague-munich ) etc. . . of course it 's difficult to chose , that 's the same way for us when we want to visit the us , and some americans mock us for wanting to do a road trip from dc to the grand canyon , but it 's hard to imagine the distances when you 've never seen the place apart from pictures !, 
  yeah if you want to do as many cities you 'll have to plan a bit . 
  similar distances in the us ( guessing you 're american because you mentioned dollars ) : paris - switzerland = new york - richmond switzerland - rome = san francisco - las vegas rome - prague = miami - atlanta prague - berlin = chicago - cincinnati berlin - stockholm = atlanta - dc stockholm - london = portland - san francisco in two , even three weeks it 's a bit short , you 'd stay like three days in each city , including transports ( and the train would take at least one day between each city ) . 
  and there 's almost no way you can have some freedom then . 
  honestly i 'd recommand to focus on one part of europe , maybe 4-5 cities big maximum . 
  if you want some freedom , you can chose one starting city , one final city ( not too far away ... ) and make your way with eurail . 
  i mean , a trip when you have freedom to chose wherever you want to go is awesome , but you do n't make big distances . 
  i had a friend do interrail ( eurail for eu citizens ) , in one month he started in venice , stopped in croatia , then stopped in serbia , went to bulgaria , and that was it . 
  if you really want some room for spontaneity , get a eurail pass . 
  that way you can go wherever people advise you to go . 
  also , most airports are far from the city centers , so you often have to add a solid ten dollars to go downtown . 
  and if you want to go to smaller cities , sometimes you wo n't find a flight . 
  eurail is most sure . 
  j how long are you staying in europe ? 
  quick edit :  paris , switzerland , rome , prague , berlin , stockholm , london/ireland ( ca n't decide which of the two ) and thanks !, 
  it takes quite some time to travel between those cities , be careful ( even by plane , as you 'd have to come early + travel to the city center ), 
  i like how fr is not metropolitan france as usual , but fx is, 
  no idea , i do n't remember . 
  i know when i was like 10 we drank cider everytime we had galettes ( breton meal ) , so like every week . 
  yeah the subtitles just say the general idea of each line , they are n't very detailed, 
  you asked for a care package :p, 
  yeah it 's a tv thing . 
  it 's what was on tv right before the first shows of the evening ( 8:50 pm ) , so only episodes of 3 minutes . 
  it has sort of become a trend of french tv in the recent years ( kaamelott is like 10 years old now ) , every big channel has one of these short comedy things . 
  it comes from [ cam\u00e9ra caf\u00e9 ( ca n't find one with subtitles , sorry ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lrbq28h790 ) , and when it was over , kaamelott took its place . 
  kaamelott was such a success that every channel wanted one . 
  so they all have a short 3 minute comedy about family life or neighbors or something . 
  [ kaamelott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iw1xtb9rzc ) is hilarious here . 
  i do n't know if the subtitles make the humour work though [ i think this one has better subtitles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi3ss2ltk20 ) [ this one too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idgxkvnix_8&amp;list=plxsl4bjcyoovsqm9vbyhvjlcmcyoy_pzo&amp;index=46 ) it 's basically the legend of king arthur where everyone but the king is stupid, 
  we have more channels now ( we had 5-6 channels in the 90 's ) , there 's even a kids channel so i guess there 's a lot more cartoons , recent or not . 
  a lot of the names change in french . 
  i mean when i grew up there were things like the looney tunes , titi et grosminet ( tweety & sylvester ) etc. . . 
  [ a few viennoiseries for your breakfast ] ( http://fournilsdeconstance.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gamme_viennoiserie-big.jpg ) , [ some saucisson for the ap\u00e9ro ] ( http://static.wixstatic.com/media/503893_bb7cde9a64584c8aa4578e6e065cb8c4.jpg ) , [ a bit of foie gras for the beginning of the meal ] ( http://www.lafitte.fr/media/nivoslider/1447423020nivoslider_image.jpg ) , [ a bottle of wine from bordeaux with your meal ] ( http://www.paroleauxjeunes.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vins-bordeaux.jpg ) , [ and some macarons for the dessert ] ( http://epicureandculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/macaron-photo-2.jpg ), 
  we 've always had your kids cartoons i think . 
  apart from that , we have a lot of series ( but series like the office never made it , having seen all the seasons , i would n't really recommand it to other french people , i do n't think we really like the humour ) . 
  we do n't have directly your tv shows ( as in jeopardize , who wants to be a millionnaire ) but sometimes we just take your tv show and do it with french people , or adapt some rules . 
  sports , obviously but it 's already answered in another comment . 
  i do n't know much more about american television . 
  we have formula one that some countries really enjoy . 
  less crashes though, 
  iceland , norway , sweden , finland and denmark have nordic crosses as flags . 
  ( talking about countries , the faroe islands also have a nordic cross for a flag i think ), 
  also , buy baguettes everyday , offer to do an ap\u00e9ritif , walk fast to not be annoyed by tourists that want to ask you for directions and look angry all the time in public transport, 
  hey they came to france too !, 
  try to force yourself to speak the language if you want to practice it . 
  i 've been in austria for 6 months and i my german did n't get better because 99 % of people spoke enough english ( and , also , they speak different from what i learned ), 
  barbecue as in smoking meat , no . 
  barbecue as in grilling , yeah we do that everytime it 's a bit sunny, 
  i meant , apart from the uk , everyone knows about brexit, 
  i do n't see any country about to leave the eu , so i 'd say yes, 
  i do n't really want anyone to join the eu until we 're stable economically . 
  you listed some countries that you said were 16 + but in france it 's 18 . 
  if you look old enough it should be okay for supermarkets and bars , clubs , sometimes , they might ask you for an id, 
  i thought it came from the german schweiz, 
  imagine you live in nazi germany . 
  what do you do ? 
  at least i have some arguments . 
  all you say is `` war is bad nothing justifies death '' . 
  by the way stop using emotes on reddit you look stupid . 
  you 're either a troll or you 're very creepy, 
  you have no idea what oppression is ... 
  there are times when you have to fight , you 're clearly too young to realize that world peace is nothing but utopia . 
  there will always be bad leaders , and when you have nothing else but violence what should you do ? 
  according to you we should just wait . 
  how can one be so naive ? 
  what if you lived under nazi rule , would you also say `` i must not riot because violence is bad '' ? 
  nice , intolerance is the best thing we have against wars . . what you are missing here is that in yougoslavia the serbs were trying to rule over several other ethnies . 
  it 's not just about independance of some region . 
  some regions are perfecrly happy , but some feel oppressed and yes , sadly they have to fight . 
  in ukraine it 's kind of the same thing , the russian populations not feeling represented by the government in kiev ( and also , financed by moscow ) . 
  how old are you ? 
  that 's the worse argument you could pick . 
  so you 'd rather be the puppet state of another country that forbids you to practice your religion ? 
  we should have let nazi germany annex the world , at least there would n't have been any deaths and destruction !, 
  also ... this is not the same time period ... 
  in western europe nowadays we vote things ... you misunderstood the lesson . 
  yes , nationalism is bad . 
  but this is a very different thing from independantism/autonomism, 
  please , you 're talking like there 's an example of independantists causing deaths . 
  history proves the opposite . 
  opposants to independances have caused wars to ensure the unity of their country . 
  but please , tell me one example of the opposite, 
  25 different notes * 7 ( 5 $ ,10 $ , ... ) is way too complicated to secure, 
  nationalism ! = independantism ... you seem very ignorant about history to believe that the independantism ( or autonomism ) in various regions of europe has anything to do with the wars we 've had on this continent . 
  stop pitying us please , it 's not like we 've survived a genocide, 
  i looked up on wikipedia , she 's apparently french and swiss , she claimed to be born in geneva but she was born in upper savoy . 
  so now we can even less send her back to switzerland ... 
  [ nabilla ( nsfw photo , honestly it looks like 80 's porn magazines haha ) ] ( http://musique.jeuxactu.com/datas/divers/a/y/ayem-et-nabilla/xl/ayem-et-nabilla-video-5550d7689c2b9.jpg ) . 
  she even kind of stole some reality shows from the kardashians . 
  famous for being utrageously idiot and being made of 90 % silicone . 
  [ you wanted a video link , but i could n't find one with subtitles . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ndfxdre7q ) it shows you what a lot of our reality tv is like though ( old-school mansion reality tv ) they 're just talking about how nabilla wants to fuck some guy ... . . sigh edit : she got nationally famous for saying `` er , hello !, 
  i mean , like , hello ? 
  you 're a girl , you got no shampoo . 
  hello . 
  hello !, 
  i dunno , you receiving me ? 
  you 're a girl , you got no shampoo ? 
  it 's like i 'd say : you 're a girl , you got no hair '' in that crapy reality tv, 
  i agreed until `` i hope one day religion will disappear '' .
