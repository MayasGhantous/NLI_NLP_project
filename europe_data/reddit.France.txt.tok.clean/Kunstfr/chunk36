  i 've never heard of church bells every 15 min so i guess we do n't have that . 
  we have church bells every hour to indicate the time ( 8 for 8am etc ) during the day , church bells after mass on sundays and weddings/funerals . 
  it 's annoying in the summer when you sleep with the window open and you hear them a sunday morning . 
  [ traditional catholics are very funny though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3wuxelokja ) . 
  the video is really funny if you speak french fluently because she speaks with a very stereotyped bourgeois accent . 
  she says if she had a gay kid she would suffer , and she would try to find a healer because her kid would also be suffering from its gayness . 
  also , she has nothing against gay people because a man taught her how to knit when she was a kid , so it was nice but if felt against nature . 
  she says the current society is purely decadent and that god 's anger will crush france . 
  that 's something we reaaaally do n't hear every day, 
  what 's funny is that you seem to be the only french person in that thread to know what they are !, 
  yeah i 've been thinking this for a while . 
  some questions are naive or insulting , but a lot of good ones have 0 upvotes ... 
  knowing the religion of all your politicians and all your neighbors . 
  like , if you do n't go to church when you live in rural us , people might judge you . 
  in france , whenever i hear about a friend that goes to church on a sunday , i think `` what the fuck '', 
  so no flag on your cheeks for football games ? 
  or is that considered a specific reason in finland ? 
  what ? ... 
  i went there two times for a total of 12-13 days for smoking , we always left the coffee shops after having smoked a few joints , we still had weed in our pockets all the time ... we even smoked in a park , far from where the people walked, 
  yeah okay we have some stone crosses ( not every road junction at all , but i see your point ... ) but still it 's very far from religion sweating from every wall, 
  also it 's very energy consuming, 
  yeah not a lot of people really watch lcp i think in france . 
  [ let 's see their programmation ] ( http://www.lcp.fr/programmes ) 8:28 - 9:29 : morning political debate 9:29 - 11:30 : parliement session 11:30 - 13:30 : events ( ?? ), 
  13:30 - 13:44 : book reviews probably 13:44 - 14:00 : defence journal , apparently they talk about how defence research boosts innovation 14:00 - 16:30 : various documentaries 16:30 - 19:30 : parliement session so i guess it 's still pretty similar to cspan ? 
  the thing is the channel is n't just lcp , it 's both lcp and public s\u00e9nat , one being the national assembly and the second being the senate . 
  you can probably watch only lcp , but from what i know it 's mostly politics, 
  yeah and some debates and tv reports when there 's no session, 
  do n't worry , you 're just a very big market so your crappy beers are famous . 
  every country has a crappy beer . 
  in france it 's kronenbourg, 
  so the basic channels : tf1 generalist private channel , france 2/france 3 generalist public channel ( fr3 is more about the regions of france with a specific hour about regional news ) , canal + is a private channel that you have to pay for 80 % of the content , was good but is sinking because of the new owner france 5 has a lot of animal/world culture documentaries m6 is a private channel with a lot of cooking shows arte is the french-german channel with some very interesting insight about the eu d8 is owned by canal + but it 's a crappy channel with idiotic talk shows w9 is owned by m6 and has some other tv contest shows and the simpsons ( it must be where 30 % of their money comes from ) tmc is owned by tf1 and ... 
  i do n't know what 's on it . 
  some movies i guess nrj12 has music and reality tv lcp is the parliementary channel , i do n't know what 's on it france 4 is the cultural public channel bfmtv is a 24/7 news channel itele is a 24/7 news channel owned by canal + d17 is owned by canal + and i do n't know , music maybe 18 might be gulli , a kids channel ? 
  after that we have some new channels like l'equipe21 which is about sports but it 's too recent i do n't know about these . 
  and these are the mandatory channels in france, 
  in france universities do n't care about grades , i do n't know how much of that is true for international students though . 
  but i would n't recommand studying any more , i think with that experience it 's easier to find a startup, 
  ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/@48.0013907,-4.0898361,3a,75y,101.71h,86.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1szi5nnklpsgxdacr7sz08eg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) it 's not always like that , in my hometown the houses are separated from each other . 
  but we got nice gardens , and nice space , while not being cold in the winter !, 
  i think most of the french carriers have like 3 to 5 gb per year for free in other countries , and 3 to 5 gb a month in france . 
  plus free sms and free phone calls ( i think i pay 0.01 $ / min for receiving a call when i 'm abroad ), 
  i can travel and never change my money . 
  that 's awesome . 
  in france : - the theory can be passed from 16 . 
  so i guess it 's the same thing as in every country : questions where you have to answer abcd about a driving situation . 
  you need a good 10 hours minimum . 
  honestly it 's not that complicated if you practice enough ( 70 % success ) . 
  then you need at the very least 20 hours of driving lessons . 
  - the thing is , you have two cases . 
  you can learn to drive with one of your parents , in that case as from 16 you can drive but not alone , and you need to drive at least 2000 km before you 're 18 when you can pass the exam . 
  - or the standard way , you learn how to drive at 18 , do more lessons ( at least 30-35 ) and pass the exam at 18 . 
  - then you pass the exam , which is like 30 minutes of driving with a few questions about how a car works . 
  60 % success . 
  but in some big cities if you fail the exam you have to wait 6 months ( that was my case ) , so more lessons , more pay . 
  really the cost then depends on a lot of things , how many hours of lessons you need , how many times you pass the exam , and what city you live in . 
  the standard price for a licence is 1034 $ on average , but that is only 20 hours of lessons , one theoretical exam and one practical exam , with no failures . 
  but it apparently is 780 $ in lille while it 's 1425 $ in paris . 
  so , a lot of variables in this !, 
  that 's almost cringey to me . 
  ca n't watch to the end because it 's fully clich\u00e9, 
  do n't you have international roaming ? 
  when i go to another country the cellphone detects it 's in another country and switches to your phone company 's partner in that country, 
  do you have any more precision than science/technology or do you have no idea ? 
  because science/technology is very broad , it can go from materials to electronics including chemistry and webdesign . 
  yeah i did n't know it was in their program before i searched for that thread . 
  fuck their program is scary, 
  [ it 's a big part of the french right-wing parties ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4r68xf/what_is_the_least_prorussian_country_in_europe/d4ypohs ), 
  [ in france it 's more complicated than that , i explained it in this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4r68xf/what_is_the_least_prorussian_country_in_europe/d4ypohs ), 
  les r\u00e9publicains , the opposition right-wing party , is opposed to embargos on russia . 
  [ in december ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/coulisses/2015/12/17/25006-20151217artfig00133-une-vingtaine-de-parlementaires-de-droite-a-moscou-pour-entretenir-le-dialogue.php ) 20 mps went to moscow to keep the dialogue with russia open . 
  more recently they managed to vote [ in favor of stopping the sanctions against russia after the crimean annexation ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/04/28/deputes-levee-sanctions-russie-pas-prevu_n_9792936.html ) . 
  and they want to do the same for the presidential elections next year . 
  roughly translated to :  1 / the rise of an europe of nations , an exit from the integrated commandment of nato and the proposition with russia of a powerful strategical alliance , founded on a military and energy partnership , the reject of wars of interference and the support to international rights, 
  in france we often criticize `` oh * this * is happening in the country of human rights ( france ) '' so we 're pretty much aware of violations of some articles . 
  human rights are a beautiful utopia but i 'm not sure any country in the world respects them fully, 
  russia is loved by a big part of the french right wing and far-right . 
  there 's a very weird relationship between france and russia . 
  yeah but you 'd have to cut the land between the us and mexico & canada too . 
  i do n't want the entire american continent to crash into ours, 
  yeah a lot of these points also are n't respected in europe, 
  yeah it 's even more annoying for us . 
  but if you heard about strikes recently , it 's just part of big strikes that started like six months ago, 
  it 's just a comfort rule i 've heard , it might be completely wrong . 
  but i guess 15 \u00b0 c should be good enough in your house, 
  -45 is not imaginable to me , sorry . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen -10, 
  haha i 'm glad that the stereotypes are the same everywhere !, 
  5 % of the population has lenses 73 % of the population has glasses . 
  not sure if the percentage of lenses is included in the number of glasses ( two different studies ), 
  eh , i 'm not sure we will catch up one day . 
  i think now the mentalities are changing , people are more careful of what they eat . 
  europe and us . 
  i mean my grandfather used to eat fat food all the time , drink red wine and smoke cigarettes . 
  every single day and every single meal . 
  now people try to be more careful about what they eat . 
  40-50 \u00b0 f i hope . 
  but how is that even possible ? 
  let 's say it 's very very hot . 
  like 130 \u00b0 f ( *** 54 \u00b0 c *** ) ( apparently the highest temperature in arizona ) . 
  80 \u00b0 f ( 27 \u00b0 c ) is a huge difference .
