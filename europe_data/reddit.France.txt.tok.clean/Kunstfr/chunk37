  no way you do n't get a cold or something out of this . 
  is n't there a rule like you should never have more than 10 \u00b0 c or something between inside and outside temperatures ? 
  i heard that when i was younger, 
  firemen , very well seen . 
  now , the police in france ... well ... 
  i guess i can say we do n't like them , the stereotypes around them is that all they do is give speed tickets , beat people in riots ( [ that 's a high schooler strike from a few months ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlelx9slqfg ) ) and be lazy and idiots ( [ if you speak french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl-noyav_nw ) ) . 
  but with the attacks in france and all , they were seen as very good guys and were [ applauded ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pst3xkxphs8 ) . 
  but now that it 's been a while , and there have been other riots since then , they 're no longer loved . 
  oh yeah the guy is nuts, 
  yeah do n't worry kids in france eat string cheese too . 
  do n't you have any `` solid '' cheeses , aka not shredded , not cream and not string cheese ? 
  we have shredded cheese too ( generally emmenthal ) and we make burritos too . 
  but that 's like a meal , i mean , it 's not the main way you eat cheese is it ? 
  seriously though how else can you eat cheese ? 
  edit : okay i need an answer because [ i really hope google is wrong on this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/thmx8pg.png ), 
  yeah , it 's a lot but a lot of college students can do it . 
  like you start at 7/8 pm and go to bed at 4 am, 
  with salad most of the time ( and/or bread and/or butter ) . 
  of course we have meals that include cheese , but then it 's directly cooked into the meal . 
  fresh cheese is eaten like this, 
  [ french cheese is eaten like this ] ( http://designerstay.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/130414115021frenchcheese1.jpg ) . 
  you often have a plate with many cheeses like this between the main course and the dessert . 
  we have a lot of english teachers from the us and the uk though . 
  thanks for including us with the edict of nantes but it was [ revoked a few years later ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edict_of_fontainebleau ) . 
  but yeah i guess it still counts as religious tolerance, 
  i mean , drinking an entire bottle is okay in france too , but not within a few minutes and not without eating prior . 
  but yeah it 's not a * huge * quantity in france . 
  it makes you drunk , yeah . 
  i mean i 'm in vienna right now and it 's better if you know some basic words and how to pronounce words . 
  you 're not eating in a spar if you ca n't pronounce putenschnitzel . 
  but yeah i 'm definitely not fluent and speak english most of the time, 
  in france ( and most of europe , if not all ) , we have never had discrimination like there was in the us before the civil rights act . 
  however , racism has always existed despite the laws . 
  discrimination is defined in the law quite the same way as you described it . 
  the thing is , we technically have free speech , but anyone can go to a police station to sue you . 
  if the judge thinks what you said was hate speech , you 'll get a fine . 
  the biggest offense is terrorism provocation or apology , punished by 5 to 7 years of prison +75000 to 100000 $ fine . 
  like if you refuse to hire someone or you fire someone for its religion , race , gender etc. . . it 's 3 years of jail + 45000 $ fine . 
  all judgements often have some side sanctions , like you ca n't vote anymore , a few days of `` citizenship class '' etc example : in 2002 michel houellebecq , a famous writer that 's known for sometimes shocking declarations , said on tv `` islam is the dumbest religion '' , he was declared non-guilty for racism incitation, 
  sosh by orange, 
  `` uh ... we do n't anticipate that ... '' and he manages to answer seriously . 
  good job , us navy admiral . 
  goat simulator is pretty famous i think , many youtubers have made videos about this silly game . 
  it 's not really a goat simulator , it 's more like an absurd simulator where you happen to play a goat ( or not ), 
  [ here ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/754/886/ea3.jpg ) . 
  flughafen-feuerwehr simulator is ... airport fireman simulator i guess , gleisbau simulator is a road construction simulator if my german is n't too rusty ? 
   i do n't believe that producers of video games , movies etc. 
  think to themselves : `` oh , this is nice , let 's release it english speaking audience , although we may have to earn something on non-english speaking market too '' . 
  i think that most of productions are meant to bring money from both markets and that producers do n't think they are releasing primarily for english speaking audience . 
  to add to this , even * american sniper * which basically glorifies the american military was a huge hit in france ( 3 million tickets sold ), 
  i know you 're mostly looking for dutch websites , but i 'll answer in case someone is interested in other countries . 
  in france , [ monster ] ( http://www.monster.fr/ ) ( in french ) apparently has a lot of offers , [ leboncoin ] ( http://leboncoin.fr/ ) ( in french too ) is sort of a craigslist so you 'd only find summer jobs and small jobs there . 
  if you actually have a degree and everything , the best thing is to check out directly on company websites . 
  i have 5gb of 4g in france every month and 5gb in europe per year . 
  so i do n't pay much more in other countries than in france ( but i ca n't waste all my data too quickly ), 
  yeah but the comment above me talked about conservatives . 
  the thing is , the words describing politics are reaaaally different between the us and europe . 
  i love learning new languages . 
  i would have loved to learn more when i was younger because it 's way more complicated when you 're an adult . 
  but i 'll at least try to be able to speak in a conversation in french ( native ) , english , and german . 
  then i 'd like to learn breton . 
  conservative in the us is different than conservative in europe though . 
  to add to what you said , i think it 's still quite seen as a nice place to live and study . 
  i mean , i have some friends studying for a few months in california , they were bragging about it and some were kind of jealous about it . 
  but yeah we still do n't like many things in the us , as you explained well, 
  distributeur in french, 
  you need to add \\ before the ) to make the link work . 
  [ that way ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pegasus_ ( console \\ ) ), 
  cellphone : iphone , samsung galaxy computer : mac , asus , hp , samsung tv : sony , samsung , phillips game consoles : i 'd say xbox 360 is still very popular especially among students , which lack the money for the next gen. 
  almost every student flat has fifa 14 . 
  ps4 is popular in the next gen other : ipads somehow popular , but tablets are n't that big of a thing, 
  well when you know what the twist is you do n't have the same reaction in a second viewing . 
  same for usual suspects, 
  ca n't wait for it . 
  defense is a rather tricky thing to put in common countries with 27 countries though . 
  we have nuclear weapons , we have a big army , some countries do n't want neither of those , and most of all , everyone wants to be able to have control over its soldiers , ie citizens of your country that you send to war . 
  well brits we accept that you come settle in france under one condition : you must learn french . 
  even in france where we are bashed for being terrible in english , we start learning english at 6 or 7 and german/spanish at 14 . 
  you can start learning a third foreign language at 16 . 
  i 'm pretty convinced the average european knows enough english to ask for what he wants in another country . 
  a lot of french people have a good pronounciation from what i 've seen , even though it 's probably not the majority , anyone who needs english daily can pronounce correctly . 
  nobody has a british or an american accent of course , but if you go to other countries you realize that even those who speak perfect english still have an accent . 
  even if you live in the us you might never have the accent . 
  in amsterdam my go-to food was febo , but the language barrier often made me chose terrible stuff, 
  well i 'm right here , 
  yeah i read your comments , and replied to them . 
  i told you many countries have a lot of diversity in landscapes on a small scale , but you just say `` no it 's not true '' , brush it off and only care about glorious slovenia . 
  now you 're starting to troll . 
  do n't bother replying , if you want you can also keep believing everything you thought before this debate . 
  have a nice day !, 
  anyway . 
  i 'm not saying slovenia is n't beautiful . 
  to finish my point of view in that discussion ( i think you and i wo n't agree anyway haha !, 
  ) , i just want to say slovenia is certainly a very diverse and it 's a very pretty country . 
  but in my opinion it 's definitely not a unique trait for slovenia . 
  you probably have n't , except if you 've been in france for six months . 
  it 's taken me 15 summers to visit all the regions, 
  you should travel more . 
  i mean , we do n't have any rules or anything . 
  we let things go , free ourselves of the constraints to any relationship !,
