  it feels nice to me not having to worry about waiting three days to call someone , and just act however i feel , 
  it belongs to both italy and france , it 's the border . 
  of course we do n't have panonia and adriatic because it 's literally geographic places . 
  but in all this comment thread you 're just showing how little you know about landscapes in other countries and you 're not even disapproving with my first comment . 
  being a big country , france has a shitton of really different landscapes that goes from highest mountains in western europe , to sand beaches , including huge pine forests , canyons etc. . . 
  your argument is `` lol you have no panonia '' . 
  what the hell is that supposed to mean ? 
  yeah , well you have no [ bretagne ] ( http://www.reka.ch/sitecollectionimages/reka-ferien/laender/regionen/bretagne.jpg ) , no [ provence ] ( https://www.caramaps.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/temp_file_provence2.jpg ) , no [ bourgogne ] ( http://www.zevoyages.com/files/2015/03/bourgogne.jpg ) , no [ pyr\u00e9nn\u00e9es ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/gentau_pic_du_midi_ossau.jpg ) ... 
  we do n't have the adriatic in france , we have the mediterranean sea . 
  avignon is 50 km from marseille and the closest mediterranean beach is 30 km . 
  50 km from there you have 1400 m tall mountains in montbrun-les-bains . 
  stop thinking slovenia is the only country with a lot of diversity on a small scale ... and again , this is a really small part of france . 
  do you even know the mont blanc is the highest mountain is the alps with 4809 meters ? 
  stop assuming you 're right in every comment ... a 50 km radius circle around avignon would have a similar variety of features ... 
  ever heard of provence , massif central , we have the alps , we have the c\u00f4te d'azur , we have the bassin toulousain . 
  it 's only 20 % of france , and it 's a similar landscape to what you just said . 
  trust me , i 've been to all of these except the dinarje-kras region . 
  yeah but i mean * really * different . 
  of course you can have a different landscape every 50 km in france too, 
  how much data do you need ? 
  going to prague on my own , i hope it will be nice !, 
  well , you do n't seem to ask questions to have serious answers , nothing can make you change your mind . 
  you came here to hear `` muslims are bad , islam is bad , fuck the leftists from / r/europe '', 
  black people are n't exactly black people either, 
  yeah but in the same way using noir ( french word for black ) was sort of frowned upon until a few years ago . 
  using `` black '' allowed us to still say a right word without being frowned upon, 
  do you know any muslims ? 
  because my roommate is one , he observes ramadan , he drinks alcohol , he smokes cigarettes , does n't eat pork , dates random girls from tinder and goes to the mosque with his family for various celebrations . 
  this is a modern muslim , this is exactly what we would like all muslims to become, 
  the variety of landscapes . 
  every 300 km it 's a very different landscape in france . 
  edit : during this ... heated argument i found nice pictures to go along with this comment . 
  enjoy !, 
  [ bretagne ] ( http://www.reka.ch/sitecollectionimages/reka-ferien/laender/regionen/bretagne.jpg ) [ provence ] ( https://www.caramaps.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/temp_file_provence2.jpg ) [ bourgogne ] ( http://www.zevoyages.com/files/2015/03/bourgogne.jpg ) [ pyr\u00e9nn\u00e9es ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/gentau_pic_du_midi_ossau.jpg ), 
  life is not black and white , there 's not just `` natives '' and `` not natives '' . 
  a child born from two ethnicities is which ethnicity ? 
  and yes , the muslims do that . 
  stop generalizing all muslims as if they were all the same type of persons , that never eat pork , never drink alcohol , support isis and do n't want to shake hands with a girl . 
  and yes , you can be a muslim and drink alcohol , as much as you can be a christian and never go to church . 
  i know that theory in french as theory of the big replacement ( th\u00e9orie du grand remplacement ) . 
  i just find the idea ridiculous . 
  people from different ethnicities have kids together , it 's not like white people stop having white kids and black people keep having always more kids . 
  people mix with each other . 
  - what 's the student culture like ? 
  depends on if you 're in a university ( more people , but less of a community ) or in a * grande ecole * ( big school , harder to get in , where you can study management , business , engineering , or whatever exists ) . 
  in the latter , which is the one i know best , you have some elected student offices that organize parties , all in all it 's a very united community where you know a lot of people . 
  it involves a lot of drinking . 
  - biggest `` student towns '' or recommended cities to study in ? 
  rennes , nantes , toulouse , lille , aix-en-provence are considered as the most important student towns . 
  you can add some other cities to the list such as bordeaux and lyon . 
  - language barrier ? 
  we had a lot of foreign students in my engineering school . 
  but they all knew a bit of french prior to coming and had french lessons here . 
  when french people are talking with other french people and there 's a foreign guy , we have the bad ) habit of keeping speaking french . 
  - tuition cost for eu citizens vs residents ? 
  i think it 's the same cost , which is a few euros a year for university , 800 $ a year for an engineering school , 5000 $ a year for a management/business school . 
  you can pay less if your parents do n't have a lot of money . 
  - normal academic year/course structure ? 
  we 're organized in semesters . 
  i do n't kno exactly how it is in an university , but in a grande ecole it 's generally a lot of general courses in your first year from various disciplines , then a specialization in the other two years that you can chose . 
  but in contrary to other countries we do n't chose the courses individually . 
  going out to dinner is definitely considered very romantic in france . 
  we do n't really have dates . 
  you can invite someone for a beer or for coffee somewhere , or if you know the person pretty well you can go to the movies . 
  but the relationship naturally moves on to whatever feels good . 
  you can sleep with someone very early in the relationship , all depends on how often you see each other and talk with each other . 
  you can sleep with someone after a drunk night , see the person again later and start a relationship, 
  yeah that 's exactly the reason why people drink alcohol : to forget the life you have and to have a bad headache . 
  or you know , you can drink responsibly , drink water to avoid the headache , and have tons of fun while drunk that you would n't have otherwise, 
  kebab is good before being drunk , while being drunk , and the day after having been drunk, 
  i 'd like a few countries to have a more integrated union . 
  but not with all the current countries that are in the eu . 
  it would not be stable enough , as we have already seen, 
  depends on the money you have , during what season you 're travelling , if you 're alone , or globally , what you like to do on vacation, 
  it 's not really a thing in france , i gues it 's more of a common law thing . 
  same in france, 
  it 's allowed in france , except on beaches i think . 
  if it 's a private property you might have to ask the owner , but other than that you 're fine, 
  yep you 're right, 
  in french we use the english name `` black '' or `` renoi '' ( french word for black , noir , reverted ), 
  well there 's actually only one case where you can dinsinherit your child . 
  it 's when that child tried to murder you . 
  hehe . 
  i did n't know the english word . 
  well if it 's true i have n't heard of it . 
  i have n't lived long enough in paris for this , and i did n't have a car . 
  when i learned to drive , i always heard to leave my handbrake on , though it was n't in paris, 
  yeah do n't worry i know about this ( :, 
   scotland, 
  in paris it 's almost impossible to park your car . 
  you can often rent a parking inside a building for between 20 $ to 200 $ a month . 
  so i guess some try to park their car wherever they can . 
  well , if you damage another car your car insurance will surely have to pay . 
  in paris they are crazy . 
  honestly i would n't drive there , i learned to drive in smaller cities , and you have to be very focused or people will yell at you . 
  in south-eastern france people care less about the rules . 
  you can be insulted but that should n't be a problem , insult them back . 
  people park in places they should n't , they are n't necessarily acting dangerously but it 's often not legal . 
  generally i would n't say people in france are really dangerous . 
  we pretty much follow the rules , but in big cities where people are stressed and have trouble parking their car and everything , well yeah sometimes it 's a mess .
