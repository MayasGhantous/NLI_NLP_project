  i mean , i 've seen how people drive in greece and in the countryside in poland , well yeah we 're nice drivers in france . 
  and no breton in brittany, 
  it is , fixing this , thanks, 
  well do you already speak any languages beside english ? 
  is there a country or a culture you 're interested in ? 
  what do you want to do for a living ? 
  quiche lorraine requires like 5 minutes of preparation at most !, 
  - [ quiche lorraine ] ( http://cocina-con-corazon.blogs.diezminutos.es/files/2013/01/01-quiche-lorraine.jpg ) ( shortcrust pastry in a mold , put grilled lard on it , mix eggs and sour cream and put it in the mold , add lots of cheese on top of it and eventually in the liquid preparation , put in the oven ) very easy to make and delicious - [ tomates farcies ] ( http://images.cuisineaz.com/origin/6ab0a1f5-e577-4fed-ac75-76410897fba1.jpg ) : it 's basically meat in a tomato baked in an oven . 
  add onions , herbs , whatever you want to the meat preparation - [ duck breast with honey ] ( http://www.simeo.tm.fr/medias/recettes/magret-canard-miel/magret-de-canard-miel.jpg ) : basically duck breast , and you use a brush to coat the breast with honey . 
  it 's slightly more complicated that the two other recipes , but only because you have to cook the duck perfectly `` pink '' ( [ like here ] ( https://www.wineandbee.com/img/cms/cuisine-wine-and-bee-vins-et-miels/magret-au-miel-wine-and-bee-vins-et-miels.png ) ) . 
  you can prepare anything with this , i think the last time i xooked it i just baked potatoes with the duck in the oven edit : oh it was apples !, 
  i usually am not a big fan of baked apples but baked apples with honey was perfect, 
  in france we have leboncoin.fr which is sort of a french craigslist . 
  personnally i find it really weird . 
  so it would be 18-26 or 17-25 or 16-24 ... 
  i mean , it 's always an `` age group '' difference . 
  you 're in your mid twenties , starting to work and everything while she 's in high school . 
  she 's not even in the early twenties , when she would be in college and you would start working . 
  not wanting to judge you , but yeah it sounds weird . 
  as others said , 20-28 would be less weird already . 
  none . 
  france is glorious . 
  well , except for [ p\u00e9tain , which is talked as a hero when we learn about ww1 and as an asshole when learning about ww2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippe_p%c3%a9tain ) , [ napol\u00e9on iii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon_iii ) is seen as a bad leader just wanting to renew the success of his uncle , but that lost the war against prussia immediately . 
  he 's done a few things too , but we do n't learn much about him apart from the war of 1870 and the loss of alsace-lorraine . 
  i mean , the uk could definitely nuke the us navy . 
  but that 's not your point , which i agree on, 
  [ check out under `` continental '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_ ( football_badge \\ ) #men ), 
  to answer more seriously , the stars do n't always mean world cup wins . 
  i 'm thinking about some african teams that have stars because of the african cup . 
  i do n't think there are rules, 
  it would n't be nice for england, 
  i do n't really like russia but i do n't like england in sports . 
  i wanted a draw and i got it, 
  i guess that 's also true in a lot of countries, 
  i like it because i like the welsh , the irish and the scottish so i can support them while i do n't like the english . 
  we have a bad defence though, 
  people keep saying prague is beautiful indeed . 
  vienna is really nice too though and that 's the only one i have visited, 
  i do n't know if people downvote you because they think it 's not a thing but in french we definitely call belgium `` le plat pays '' , `` the flat land '' . 
  for france , i 'd say if i had to only name a few : ww2 ww1 war of 1870 napoleonic wars hundred years war apart from that we learn about some other wars but i 'm pretty sure the majority of people could n't name much more . 
  we know about the crusades but not how many there were . 
  we know we had a huge colonial empire but we do n't learn it in details , just that we had a lot of africa , a bit of america , indochina and a lot of colonies in the pacific ocean . 
  but mostly we learn about how colonization in africa was terrible for the population and in america because of the triangular slave trade . 
  same in france and many other countries i think . 
  houseboats are frequent in many cities in france like paris or nantes where it 's really beautiful around the river erdre, 
  i mean even in the schengen area , to add to what others said , you can always be checked by a custom officer . 
  like between france and belgium ( because people bring weed from the netherlands ) you can have your car checked and everything . 
  between france and switzerland , when i was a kid our bus has been checked . 
  yeah , but they 're imported . 
  it does n't mean cheapest beers in mexico taste worse or anything, 
  it 's the cheapest beers you can find in a french supermarket . 
  well , we helped you to piss of the brits and you paid back in the 20th century . 
  apart from that we do n't even learn about it much in school . 
  we mostly care about our revolution . 
  i 'm in austria right now and everything is fine haha . 
  i escaped france at the right time, 
  yep, 
  i looked it up it seems to be very close indeed . 
  i do n't know if that 's the case with bocce ball but in p\u00e9tanque the throwing balls are full steel so they 're pretty heavy while the target ball is in plastic or cork or whatever . 
  france is n't under `` benefits '' anymore :(, 
  football , card games , but most important : [ p\u00e9tanque ] ( http://www.ville-guerande.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/img_garde/p%c3%a9tanque.jpg ) . 
  the number one summer game in france . 
  beach rugby is pretty fun too . 
  i 'm not in france so yeah i can imagine . 
  i 'm following all these news from far away, 
  that 's something they did n't tell me !, 
  haha, 
  france , well i guess we 're hoping to win even though it wo n't be easy at all . 
  i 'm in austria actually at the moment and people seem very enthousiastic about their team, 
  i mean most of the time they would n't go to a mental hospital , but they would need to stop working for a few months, 
  haha we have a very severe tendancy to use english words and changing their meaning . 
  we use burnout for people that are really exhausted because of their job , it 's often people with a big position that work too many hours every week and have way too many reponsabilities . 
  i guess it 's sort of a depression or something ? 
  i think there kind of is a stigma everywhere , but mental diseases like depression and burnout are accepted . 
  i think france is one of the countries taking the most antidepressors in the world . 
  apart from that , it 's treated like regular diseases . 
  mental hospitals , mental emergencies , you can go there if you feel bad or if you 're really sick some people close to you can force you to go there . 
  there 's regularly stories of schizophreniac people who murder other persons in the streets even though they 've already been diagnosticed as dangerous . 
  1515 is the battle of marignan which every french person knows but nobody really knows who fought or what was at stake . 
  it 's just a funny year i guess . 
  1515 being pronounced quinze cent quinze . 
  rosbif is used ** a lot ** in french . 
  more than schleu for german . 
  especially in the context of competition ( sports of course but even when talking about the differences in politics and economics, 
  i 'm in my mid 20 's too and plenty of people my age have one . 
  i 'm from brittany so the distance might explain those differences !, 
  i 'm neither of those and i seen them everywhere , it 's nice for chilling . 
  what city are you from ? 
  i mean , [ it 's trendy ] ( http://www.lhommetendance.fr/tendances-casquettes-homme/ ) , sorry if you do n't have one ; o, 
  yep definitely , i just wanted one nickname per country but we have many others . 
  like we also say angliches for the uk . 
  we have a lot of nicknames for the germans . 
  in the case of france , people that are in a different timezone because they are far away from us have different tv channels , or watch tv with a little delay . 
  i had a girlfriend from reunion island ( utc +4 ) , they just watched what they wanted to see earlier in the day . 
  in the case of french polynesia ( utc-10 ) , they have their own tv channels, 
  not really ... 
  i guess some politicians ( far-left and far-right ) like to say that we are controled by germany and that any of our presidents dares say nothing to merckel . 
  uk : rosbifs germany : boches italy : ritals us : amerloques spain : espingouins russia : ruskovs poland : polaks and for any country whose food is known , `` bouffeurs de [ food ] '' . 
  for example for spain , `` bouffeurs de paela '' means `` paela-eaters '', 
  in france young people often wear caps , i do n't know where you 're from but at least 80 % of my friends wear a cap sometimes .
