  '' [ ... ] in your country '' is literally in half the threads in this subreddit and is never implying europe is a country edit : missed a word, 
  i mean dating sure is different in the us from here in france at least, 
  the op is czech and does n't say europe is a country at all ... 
   also the story of having potato fields guarded by soldiers and deliberately letting peasants steal them at night to improve their image seems to be pop up again and again . 
  i heard that one , made by [ antoine parmentier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antoine-augustin_parmentier ) ( whose name became associated in gastronomy with potatoes , like hachis parmentier or omelette parmenti\u00e8re ) . 
  wikip\u00e9dia seems to agree with it, 
  how is [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6ja01h/how_feasible_is_it_for_a_middle_class_family_with/ ) thread dumb ? 
  i mean [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6k4irt/im_told_that_dating_doesnt_exist_in_europe_how_do/ ) is not a dumb question . 
  or [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6jyzl1/what_is_your_favorite_american_movie_featuring_an/ ) . 
  or [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6jsjzo/which_north_american_city_is_comparable_to_the/ ) . 
  [ or this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6ja01h/how_feasible_is_it_for_a_middle_class_family_with/ ) . 
  and it 's not even only american questions . 
  i feel like random threads are downvoted for no reason, 
   ( 113 m ^ 2 ) how much does that cost ? 
  yeah ... imo all relationships start two ways : either you are both drunk at a party and end up hooking up , or you ask the other person is she 'd like to get a beer sometime . 
  then you hook up, 
  is n't free limiting the data flow though ? 
  around verdun i 'd suggest the ossuary of douaumont if it 's not already on your list . 
  it 's impressive . 
  not all kids , and apparently it 's decreasing every year because parents are scared . 
  but yeah it 's still frequent, 
  paris just so that i can move out after i 'm 18 and realize how cheap the rest of france is in comparison, 
  when it rains though ... 
  it never stops raining . 
  i prefer the rain we have in brittany , that 's not even strong enough to get you wet, 
  you can still give it a try !, 
  what about us bretons ? 
  i 'm not mediterranean, 
  ( croquembouche being a portemanteau of croque/en/bouche meaning `` crunches in the mouth '' ), 
  it 's an amazing show . 
  it 's really dumb , so i like it, 
  i loved rick and morty but adventure time ? 
  i thought it was boring, 
  what the fuck . 
  everybody makes fun of them already in france, 
  alright but i 'm not the one who asked the question in the first place, 
   - there is no border like in the rest of eu . 
  an empty checkpoint building that used like once a year right after a terrorist attack . 
  even less than ones between , say , france and germany . 
   he was talking about the language border between the czech and slovak languages, 
  i do n't read that many books , but yeah i love to read about it online . 
  it took a lot of letters , maps and stuff like that from the archives of the ministry of foreign affairs and explained them . 
  i learned a ton of stuff i 'd have never heard about before it . 
  200 documents written by kings , ministres , presidents ... 
  everywhere . 
  like if i 'm walking in a city , i 'd say every 30 sec on average . 
  i love kebabs . 
  one of my favourite tshirts shows my love for kebabs, 
  they never bothered me more than ethnic french did . 
  some are assholes , some are n't, 
  french-speakig africans , maghrebi in the cities . 
  british in the countryside . 
  dutch in camping cars, 
  when i go to a restaurant or a caf\u00e9 i 'm there to spend time with my friends , and could n't care less about what the waiter says . 
  i 'd prefer him leaving me alone, 
  after france , no . 
  republic street , republique square , yeah . 
  we do have streets for other countries and cities though ( and of course french cities , paris street being the street in the direction of paris ), 
   p\u00e9tanque vs ... well ... nothing . 
  judging by his flair he 's finnish, 
  that 's basically what we 've had [ for decades ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/assembl%c3%a9e_nationale_ ( france \\ ) #majorit . c3.a9s _ et_pr . c3.a9sidence _ depuis_1958 ), 
  apparently do n't bring hershey 's or stuff like that , they put stuff in it that europeans are n't used to that apparently tastes like vomit . 
  as a whole , there 's many types of food we also have here , so i would n't suggest bringing any . 
  but sometimes we lack some flavours . 
  like for example i know whenever someone goes to the us , he 'll bring 2 kg of m&m 's of various flavours we do n't have like mint flavoured . 
  of course even those can be purchased here on some special websites but you know what i mean . 
  i have n't seen one in years ... 
  they say americans can buy them by dozens in what they call `` supermarket '' ... 
  i started a comment at 11:30 but had to go to lunch so i had to stop it, 
  blank ? 
  man you really need to eat a good one . 
  i thought the same until a friend from marseille cooked one for me . 
  it was delicious . 
  well sort of , but it 's not particularly islam or judaism at fault, 
  wait are you travelling for clothing and shoes ? 
  well i know a friend whose mom does n't work , but his dad gots a pretty nice paycheck ... like at least upper middle class . 
  he 's no millionaire but he 's got a nice job . 
  they never had a lot of money though, 
  also you have a very low density of population . 
  it 's not easy to live in a house when you work in paris . 
  even dublin has 4588 inhabitants per square km , if you look at nantes ( western france , similar population and density ) , people have houses there too . 
  people living in flats does n't mean they do n't like houses , it 's just not possible or very expensive, 
  no idea why you got downvoted , just telling you it was n't me . 
  anyway , yeah we got many stereotypes against romania ... cyprien , the biggest french youtuber by number of subscribers , [ made a video about it because he 's from there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdfl78d26u4 ) , subtitles available, 
  jonathan lambert on on n'est pas couch\u00e9s ( for the curious , i had to look it up , i had n't heard about that ) ... well the only articles i can find are saying that romanians got really angry at him and that the romanian ambassador condamned that ` joke ' , sorry , i do n't think he was fined . 
  it 's not like that guy 's funny anyway, 
  eric zemmour , a famous far-right err . . 
  i do n't know what his job is but i guess he 's on tv a lot ... 
  that 's a really small fine though . 
  dieudonn\u00e9 , a humorist was fined 27000 $ for two internet videos , one being a parody music video mocking the shoah , the other saying `` the biggest scammers of the planet are jews '' . 
  the thing is , yeah you can disagree with fines being deserved here , but honestly fines like that for big names like they are do n't matter much . 
  and i ca n't find any article about someone being fined for hate speech online ( only incitation to terrorism , where the guy got 2 years of prison for inciting someone to do a terror attack , regular consultation of jihadists websites and channels ) . 
  you can also see them online , but for some reason some people want to see the lists printed in high schools, 
  if i wanted to see my favorite time period i 'd go to 1799 just to live during the first empire . 
  it 's a dictature , i know , but that 's pretty cool too and napol\u00e9on seemed well liked . 
  otherwise i 'd chose 1962 , right after the evian accords so tht i live in a wealthy time period without being conscripted in the algerian war, 
  [ good way to end up guillotined ... ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/terreur_ ( r % c3 % a9volution_fran % c3 % a7aise \\ ) ), 
  dollars obviously . 
  i 'd say the average frenchman thinks 1 $ = $ 1 , which is an alright estimation . 
  canadian dollars , i do n't know .
