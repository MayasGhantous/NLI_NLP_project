  perhaps people would just say dollar . 
  mexican peso , i 'm pretty sure people do n't know about it . 
  hell when reading your question i could n't even remember it at first . 
  and i have no idea about the exchange rate, 
  well it 's a cool place to go . 
  when you go up the tour montparnasse , it 's actually the only place in paris where you ca n't see the most awful building in paris, 
  i mean if there is 100 % proof that the election was rigged and your system ca n't deal with it with any other way than a violent revolution , then that 's a fucked up democracy, 
  i prefer ib over jackie brown , four rooms , django unchained and the hateful eight . 
  and i also love those movies ( well except four rooms , that was weird ), 
  in 2013 , 102 students . 
  with a total of around 700.000 taking the bac every year . 
  it 's a bit defining , in the sense that you ca n't go to many engineering schools without a scientific bac for example . 
  but even that is n't totally true , as many students there also come from technological bacs . 
  having the right bac makes your life easier ( although you ca n't really find a job only with a bac ) , but it 's still possible if you really want something to find other , more difficult ways . 
  there 's some hate , but it 's not like americans are perfect towards us . 
  they keep insulting us , using stereotypes , calling us fags and saying huge bullshit about how they came to paris and it 's now under sharia law . 
  that thread annoyed me . 
  seriously , we 're all ignorant towards each other . 
  i do n't pretend to know everything about any country besides my own ( and even then ... ) , so why do they keep saying shit about ours ? 
  another problem might be a difference in mentalities , what they expect from us being how they behave in the us . 
  i think we tend to criticize a lot in europe , and americans seem upset by that, 
  well it 's adapted to american taste . 
  and mostly stuff we never eat, 
  wait is it usual to have people assaulting police officers in the us ? 
  it 's certainly rare over here , when it happens we hear all about it in the news, 
  we have the ** baccalaur\u00e9at ** i think it 's happening right now . 
  or maybe it 's over , i do n't know . 
  anyway , we 've got different types of high school and i do n't know much about other than general high school . 
  it also has probably changed a bit but you 'll get the general idea . 
  okay so we 've got 3 categories of baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral . 
  scientific ( s ) , economics and social ( es ) and litterature ( l ) . 
  each one of those categories has different classes ( maths , physics and chemistry , history and geography , french/litterature , foreign language 1 , foreign language 2 , economics , pe , philosophy , biology , ... ) . 
  depending on your category ( s/es/l ) and your speciality ( i do n't know if all categories have it , but for instance in scientific you can have a speciality in engineering/maths/physics and chemistry/biology ) , you have different classes ( scientific does n't have economics for instance ) . 
  at the baccalaur\u00e9at you have oral and/or written exams , you get a grade out of 20 that is weighted depending on your speciality and everything . 
  you get the baccalaur\u00e9at if you have more than 10 , then you get various honorary mentions : `` assez bien '' ( well enough ) over 12 , `` bien '' ( good ) over 14 , `` tr\u00e8s bien '' ( very good ) over 16 . 
  if you have more than 20 i think you can meet the president . 
  but how do you get more than 20 if you 're graded on a scale of 20 ? 
  optional classes like latin can give you bonus points . 
  like if you average is 13 with the baccalaur\u00e9at and you get more than 13 in latin , latin counts and your average increases a bit . 
  also , yeah , we have a lot of press coverage with specialists , especially in philosphy , saying what students should have talked about . 
  [ it sort of happened in france . 
  the toulouse team moved to saint-ouen , near paris because it was absorbed by the red star fc . 
  toulouse did n't have a pro team for 12 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toulouse_fc_ ( 1937 \\ ) ), 
  mollywood is the film industry from thiruvananthapuram and malayalam-speaking kollywood is from chennai . 
  tollywood is from hyderabad . 
  bollywood is from bombay and in hindi . 
  inglorious basterds is one of the weaker tarantino films ? 
  why ? 
  [ we 'll never know ] ( http://www.napoleonguide.com/images/execlouis.jpg ), 
  austria was awesome . 
  it 's beautiful . 
  even the cities . 
  like vienna is juste way prettier than paris . 
  honestly i feel like it 's mostly cities in the south , around the mediterranean all cities ( not just france ) seem dirty ... and paris too, 
  i mean i have a masters so many of my friends have the same degree but it does n't mean much, 
  i know , i just think i learned it during football games :p, 
  watching football games i guess, 
  yeah that 's really cool . 
  there are a lot of concerts , people play everywhere in the streets , it 's really nice, 
  i 'd feel weird writing that, 
  how much time do you plan on having ? 
  what 's your budget ? 
  also / r/travel might help you too, 
  what 's a party trick ? 
  the weather does have a big effect . 
  that 's how we know if a year will have good wine or not, 
  okay , tchao !, 
  it 's played in several cities but it 's not popular at all . 
  we heard briefly about the french national team because we beat finland this year but that 's about it, 
  also , we 'll have a lot more of climate refugees coming from africa and the middle east than anything we 've had before . 
  wines in france will taste like spanish ones , we 'll have bordeaux-like wine in brittany and southern england ( yikes ), 
  really ? 
  what field do you work in ? 
  because it seems like in engineering everybody talks about yearly salary before taxes, 
  [ emmanuel macron yelled a bit too loudly at the beginning of his presidential campaign ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udbpw2rmqnc ) . 
  it was a huge buzz online and people started to know his face [ jacques chirac ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=304uhize01c ) yelled at an israeli security officer in english because they kept pushing the journalists, 
  `` montjoie saint-denis ! '', 
  it 's the battle call of the kings of france `` vive la r\u00e9publique , vive la france '' is what politicians , and mostly presidents , say at the end of their declarations . 
  i do n't know if we have a modern battle cry ? 
  [ joe dassin - l'am\u00e9rique ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpn52krqx3k ) [ michel sardou - les lacs du connemara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj2zn0ioe94 ) [ charles aznavour - la boh\u00e8me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwlc0j52b2i ) this one is more recent and about a city , but hey it 's a bit funny if you speak french : [ b\u00e9nabar - bruxelles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-su8b9awxo ), 
  being european means being a citizen from a country of europe .

  however , [ that guy ] ( http://www.laparoledearthur.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/carte-d-identite-14.jpg ) is french, 
  i do n't understand your suggestion, 
  do you know what we call a quarter pounder with cheese in france ? 
  pintes are 50 cl though , it 's just a name like galopin is 12,5 and deli is 25, 
  yeah they had n't disappeared but they were mostly old or rich people names, 
  yeah i mean rent prices keep increasing , we earn less money than our parents used to ... 
  i think in the polls we 're the first generation that does n't think we 're gon na have a better life than our parents . 
  it 's sad . 
  but hey , it does n't mean i ca n't enjoy life . 
  go out with your friends , travel , go to festivals !, 
  we do . 
  i think there was three days of mourning after the 13th of november attacks,
