  gesaffelstein and brodinski were popular too a few years ago . 
  mr. oizo released a new album so it 's not old anymore . 
  saw him live last year it was awesome, 
  french , i do n't know , you tell me . 
  the question should be reversed really . 
  i guess it sounds classy and almost pretentious from what i 've heard in american media english sounded cool and bad-ass . 
  it can still be pretty bad-ass , but cool , i do n't know . 
  useful and easy would be better imo . 
  massive , probably not by us standards . 
  but yeah there 's definitely going to be something on that day, 
  - [ statue of liberty ] ( http://p7.storage.canalblog.com/78/68/284584/63593426.jpg ) , \u00cele aux cygnes , paris, 
  [ the buildings are nothing alike though . 
  ] ( http://www.surcoufhotel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dinan-1228-1128x640.jpg ) even the picture in normandy does n't really look like normandy, 
  there are some frequent scandals though . 
  from the top of my head , the th\u00e9o affair ( black guy raped with a cop 's baton ) , r\u00e9mi fraisse ( far-left militant who died because of an offensive grenade was misused ... yes riot control units have offensive grenades ... ) , many people that lost an eye because of flashballs ... 
  personally i never had problems with the police , but there often are some scandals, 
  kamini is awesome dude, 
  the seller still lives in it until he dies . 
  so the seller does n't care , he just gets extra money, 
  come on our anthem is absolutely awesome thanks to that, 
  [ licence iv - viens boire un p ` tit coup \u00e0 la maison ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzat-_gwvxy ) ( licence iv the license required to sell alcohol , the song means drop by and have a drink ) [ do you even need lyrics ? 
  ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/fr/viens-boire-un-ptit-coup-%c3%a0-la-maison-drop-and-have-drink.html ) and yes , it got platinum disc in 1987 and was # 1 for 13 weeks, 
  some fun facts in general that concern france : 2 cooking books are published everyday on average in france in pierrelatte there 's a crocodile farm . 
  crocodiles can bathe happily in a warm water that comes from the nearby nuclear plant . 
  the oldest person to have ever lived ( in recorded history at least ) was french . 
  at the age of 90 ( 1965 ) she sold her house in * viager * ( you pay less than usual until the person dies ) to her notary . 
  the notary died in 1995 , 2 years before she did . 
  yeah when it 's really hot maybe but if i 've planned ahead i just have water bottles in the fridge, 
  we still have the [ french-breton war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french-breton_war ) ( guerre de bretagne ) even though we 're one country, 
  i do n't know about the us but i only put ice in my drinks when the temperature is above 30 \u00b0 c. 
  under that , i do n't like how it dilutes the taste, 
  i have a good friend that 's one . 
  other than that , no idea, 
  so what you 're saying is that we need to invade a neighbouring regional power and declare our unification in a symbolic place ? 
  flair does n't check out, 
  can confirm , am at restaurant and happy, 
  acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise is the organization that rules the french language and says if new words are created or not, 
  i also thought of the crushing of the commune of paris, 
  we have lessons about how the french republic works in 6th grade i think . 
  we also learn a lot in history class when talking about the revolution, 
  seriously , no . 
  it 's incredibly stupid when locals do that , do n't do that as a tourist . 
  i have like 40 km to do , i do it by car it 's 40 minutes . 
  pretty long for me but i know americans do that kind of commute often, 
  from my experience we say * une autre * in my region ( another one ), 
  alright, 
  it was during class, 
  i do n't know if it 's everywhere in france but whenever a kid yelled `` autruche ! '', 
  ( ostrich ) everybody had to put his head under the table, 
  kids ? 
  we do that with my friends . 
  are we immature ? 
  nah , my point was that there 's a bigger encouragement to have kids here , that 's all . 
  the average age is 28.5 , he said he 's in his mid 20 's . 
  seems alright to me, 
  nah the fn was already strong long before brexit and trump . 
  le pen just supported them . 
  now it 's crumbling and the party 's dying ( not related to brexit and trump ), 
  france still encourages women in having kids a lot , that 's why we still have a good fertility rate, 
  the only graduation ceremony i 've had was my engineering school , we just wore suits ( dresses for the women ), 
  we do n't have a nickname for the euro in particular . 
  for other nicknames of money we use ( [ from here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6c4pgl/which_words_are_used_to_refer_to_money_in_your/dhrvccg/ ) ) ** bl\u00e9 ** - corn ** patates ** - potatoes ** briques ** - bricks ** fric ** - etymology says it would mean `` feast '' in english ** pognon ** - from pogner to punch ** oseille ** - sorrel ( it 's a plant ) ** liquide ** - liquid ** sou ** - from latin solidus meaning solid ** esp\u00e8ces ** - from late latin speci\u0113s meaning spice ** p\u00e9p\u00e8tes ** - from p\u00e9pite meaning nugget of gold ** thune ** - unclear possibly a form of `` tunis '' the city . 
  they adapted themselves to france , really . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/how-mcdonalds-conquered-france-2014-8/ ) is pretty interesting . 
  well , you know , it 's still junk food , but they understood the french mentality ( which burger king did n't a few decades ago ), 
  - breakfast around 7-8 : coffee , fruit juice , cereal or toasts ( butter/jam/nutella ) . 
  in the weekend , you might buy croissants or stuff like that if you want to enjoy a good breakfast . 
  - lunch around 12:30 - for kids : go\u00fbter around 16:30 , cereal bars , fruits , stuff like that . 
  - dinner around 20 i 've always eaten more during dinners but i do n't know if it 's a normal thing . 
  mcdonald 's is huge in france . 
  we 're second in number of restaurants after the us . 
  it 's a big part of young people lives . 
  we also have quick ( belgian brand i think ) that 's absolutely terrible , but fortunately they were bought by burger king . 
  burger king had left france a few decades ago because mcdo was too strong . 
  they 're coming back . 
  kfc is here since a good number of years already . 
  five guys just arrived . 
  of course , we have kebab shops , usually served with fries . 
  personally i go to restaurants every day for lunch . 
  but usually , you go there like every few months , i do n't know , something like that ? 
  it depends on your age and your job really, 
  tell that to all those heretics . 
  i 'd agree with you but i do n't want to be confused with those, 
  no france, 
  hmm yeah you seem to be right . 
  between the end of the hundred years war and the beginning of the italian wars . 
  good catch !, 
  i will survive !, 
  i will surviiiive, 
  do n't know much about jordan aside from the fact that i 'd love to go to petra . 
  i 'd love to go to lebanon . 
  apparently beiruth is awesome and very european-like , plus lebanese food is delicious . 
  are you asking for what the news are currently in our countries ? 
  if yes , we 're currently in the middle of our legislative election , so w 're talking about that . 
  we 're also talking about the uk elections , about lafarge 's deals with isis in syria and navalny 's arrest in russia, 
  i 'm brown haired , i prefer brown haired women . 
  i know , i was just joking about how we could n't say the same for france . 
  the 90 's were also pretty uneventful here, 
  we got the world cup in 1998 ... 
  please come visit europe .
