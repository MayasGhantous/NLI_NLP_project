  you 'd be surprised . 
  i think everyone has different tastes . 
  and ultimately i 'm not convinced hair colour is a deal breaker ( well , almost ), 
  robespierre also sometimes, 
  litres of coffee . 
  black , no sugar, 
  we have those in france . 
  raid is the most known brand because of tv ads i guess . 
  [ automatic ones are plugged directly on an electrical outlet ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=raid+antimoustique&amp;rlz=1c1chbd_frfr745fr745&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewit89izmbruahud5xokhwy4d3qq_auicygc&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=771 ), 
  i looked at wikipedia to make sure i was n't wrong , but i ca n't see any boring period . 
  i 'd put it closer to a big city . 
  i 'm actually moving soon because the city i live in is too small and boring, 
  [ looks great to me ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/flag_of_milwaukee%2c_wisconsin.svg/1486px-flag_of_milwaukee%2c_wisconsin.svg.png ), 
  there is n't much to see on the alaskan flag , colorado 's looks like a brand logo and kinda the same for new mexico ( i know it comes from the native american pueblo but still ) . 
  they do n't really look like flags to me, 
  i pretty much only find the californian one okay , but i wished they removed the text which should never be on a flag . 
  few of those could be flags of actual countries, 
  absolutely not, 
  yeah and 007 spectre, 
  it was n't really erasmus but we had a ton of exchange students , only they stayed 2 years instead of 6 months . 
  well yeah they integrated very well , spoke perfect english with a tiiiiny accent in the end , got boyfriends and girlfriends ... 
  i mean there 's some nationalities which have very sexy accents in france , italian and spanish being two of those . 
  so guys would definitely hit on you . 
  i mean it 's not all about sex of course so i do n't think there 's much to be scared about , it 's not all about sex and alcohol . 
  if you want to have sex , it will be possible . 
  might also be because companies try to be successful in their own country first , then the rest of europe and the world . 
  if you start in the silicon valley you immediately have clients all over the us . 
  just a theory, 
  i start at 7 am , usually people in offices start around 8-9 , workers can start at about any hour, 
  no , i keep saying the same stuff since the beginning and have absolutely no idea what your problem is, 
  western europe wants the eu to move towards more integration . 
  it does n't mean that they 're the only ones , but we wants to . 
  wow that is exactly what you 're saying , no there is n't just we and ce , wow , it 's crazy . 
  my point , from the beginning of this comment chain , was that the countries that refuse to follow the eu migrant quotas are concidentally the same that do n't wish for more eu integration and are also opposed to a two-speed eu . 
  you 're making yourself angry by imagining things i have n't said . 
  you 're right , but i think if you wanted to escape war ( or get a better life , let 's be honest about those migrants ) , you 'd go in the countries where you get money , makes sense , and you said it already . 
  but i 'm not sure it would fix the problem , they would still come here because they 're persuaded we 're some sort of eldorado and we 'd have way more poverty in the streets in my opinion, 
  western europe , as a whole , accepts the quotas . 
  central europe , as a whole , does n't . 
  what other countries do you put in central europe ? 
  [ austria ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-austria-iduskcn0vs12j ) ? 
  alright , i 'll put slovenia with central europe if you want : slovenia is the only country in central europe that accepts the quotas . 
  alright then what 's the solution ? 
  wall ourselves in , they 'll come by boat . 
  sink the boats and let them die ? 
  help them get to the shore then send them back to their countries ? 
  wait they wo n't tell us where they are from . 
  are we supposed to just send them randomly to the middle east ? 
  [ oh yeah ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/03/now-serbia-and-czech-republic-join-call-to-reject-migrants-in-wa/ ) please [ tell me about how ] ( https://euobserver.com/migration/137857 ) all [ the v4 members are so accepting of migrants ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/787554/eu-poland-hungary-accept-more-migrants-leave-the-bloc-quotas-beata-szydlo-viktor-orban ), 
  building a big wall around the eu is nor a viable solution nor is it efficient . 
  i agree with all my heart that we should n't let millions of refugees inside the eu , but then we have to build refugee camps or something . 
  we have to do something . 
  the european mentality the eu promotes is about helping thy neighbour . 
  i did n't even mention eastern europe anywhere, 
  i do n't get what you 're saying , but imo v4 is central european, 
  because they do n't want two-speed eu . 
  they want to stay as it is right now . 
  while others want to go forward ... 
  nah , it 's the eu , there never is any sanction . 
  might piss western europe a bit , might push for a two-speed eu . 
  but sanctions , no, 
  nothing probably, 
  wine , saucisson and cheese . 
  we would n't survive for long but at least it 'd be better than those expats who miss french gastronomy, 
  jus multivitamin\u00e9 in france, 
  they already authorized things like n\u00e9nufar ( normal word being n\u00e9nuphar ) , both have the same pronounciation . 
  it looks really ugly though , if you removed the silent letters it would n't look very good imo . 
  and it 's pretty useful to understand the meaning of the new word based on the etymology . 
  facebook for everything . 
  i mean whatsapp is used but not as widely as in other countries . 
  teenagers used snapchat a lot too last i 've heard , it might have already changed though, 
  i 'm curious about why you do n't include france is your list of secular countries . 
  anyway . 
  we basically do n't care about those . 
  atheists like me are just happy to get days off even though for some holidays you do n't even know what it is about . 
  assumption ? 
  what are these ? 
  yeah . 
  very possible , it really means dude, 
  heresy ... 
  i 'm not even going to answer on industrial dishes :p and honestly growing up a lot of families seemed to make fries at home in brittany, 
  how do you make fries ? 
  yeah but i 've also seen pot with oil . 
  he did n't get the 500 signatures from mayors required to be an official candidate : /, 
  7 years : - 4 years in law school ending with a master in law . 
  can be 5 years because there 's other ways to get to the next step . 
  - exam to enter a regional centre for lawyer training ( crfpa ) , 35 % of success . 
  - 1 year of crfpa that includes two internships , one in a law firm , the other with anyone who works in law . 
  after this year you need to pass a capa ( certificate of aptitude to the lawyer profession ) which is pretty easy ( 99 % success ) . 
  - 2 years of internship in a law firm . 
  in france you can use `` mec '' , it 's similar to `` dude '', 
  i mean we had for this election sylvain durif , an online nutjob that calls himself the cosmic christ, 
  mon homme is used for women when talking about their male partner so i feel like you 're flirting with me or something like that . 
  you 're not , are you ? 
  all countries have that , france is french republic , but people still call you ireland and us france, 
  we usually say rdc for that one and congo-brazaville for the other one, 
  i 'm used to czech republic but in the meantime it feels weird to call you by your long name . 
  i ca n't feel of another country we call the same way . 
  it 's free if you 're french and your parents are n't rich enough , otherwise we have [ tuition fees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuition_fees_in_france ) . 
  it 's not that expensive and you often have grants with things like erasmus ( european student exchange program ) .
