i 'm watching the documentary . 
  a french policeman say that french law does n't allow police to do this if it 's not proved that these peoples will make `` jihadist attacks '' . 
  10 years ago in my city in champagne-ardenne ( france ) they found dead bodies of prussian soldiers from the franco-prussian war of 1870 , during earthwork in a park hall . 
  my city being `` in twinning '' with another german city , they took the opportunity to invite the german mayor and others german peoples for an official ceremony/funerals . 
  and now in the cemetery , there is a square for german soldiers . 
  great !, 
  i will travel to your country the next week and love snow . 
  i expect public transport will be ok . 
  in france we have the [ beauceron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beauceron ) , the [ berger des pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pyrenean_shepherd ) , the [ briard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/briard ) , and the [ berger picard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berger_picard ) . 
  just to clarify one thing , sarkozy invited ghadafi to install [ his tent in the garden of hotel de marigny ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2007/12/07/une-tente-pour-le-colonel-kadhafi-a-paris_7214 ) , the offical residence for state visitors , not in elys\u00e9e garden . 
  snow therapy was a great movie !, 
  france number one in something !, 
  yeah !, 
  great !, 
  if you are in samo\u00ebns , you have to go to sixt-fer-\u00e0-cheval , in the end of the valley . 
  there is one the most beautifull natural [ cirque ] ( http://s-www.ledauphine.com/images/c0df30e2-fe4e-4d79-85b8-8128bb6e47be/ldl_v0_12/le-site-du-fer-a-cheval-offre-un-paysage-exceptionnel-1470995020.jpg ) of france with a lot of waterfall . 
  it 's a great place for hiking , except in case of fog . 
  what the fuck is that !? 
  i 'm french and i never heard of it untill now . 
  this is so silly ... 
  a thing that a lot of peoples forget is that uk was also defeated by germany in 1940 , like france . 
  they just were saved by the channel . 
  [ mcnulty ] ( https://youtu.be/fecqdave60e?t=15 ) is a true irish . 
  triggered !, 
  no picasso or dali ? 
  in france the most famous `` lithuanian '' person is the whriter [ romain gary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romain_gary ) . 
  he was born in 1914 in vilnius , but was not really lithuanian because at this time it was the russian empire . 
  then he came in poland and finally emigrated in france at 14 years old . 
  he is famous in france because is he is the only author to have won the prix goncourt twice ( greatest french literature prize ) . 
  [ guillaume tell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_tell ) ( or wilhelm/guglielmo/guglielm , long live to the four languages of switzerland ) is well know in europe , although he may not existed . 
  and maybe [ le corbusier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_corbusier ) is famous in europe too . 
  in france he is famous because he is also french . 
  for whriters i would say that jules vernes is as famous as victor hugo , perharps more famous . 
  jules vernes is [ the most translated french author ] ( http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1l=5&amp;ntyp=min&amp;topn=50 ) . 
  he published 54 novels and he is considered as the father of sci-fi ( with h.g wells ) . 
  we can add a military officier : * lafayette , * hero of the two worlds * for his involvement in american and french revolution . 
  and there are also great philosophers : * voltaire , liberalist , humanist , in favour of freedom of expression and religion , he influenced the french revolution . 
  for the moment french newspapers say that a truck ( big truck 18 tons ) charge the crownd , then the driver come down and shot in the street and finaly get shot by the police . 
  the prefecture talks about 30 deads . 
  not again ... edit : 60 deads now ... 
  germany was also invited [ in 1994 ] ( http://www.franceinfo.fr/sites/default/files/styles/mea_635x357/public/asset/images/2015/07/14_juillet.jpg?itok=6ljf4op7 ) with others nations ( in the eurocorp ) . 
  i remember an interview of french veteran of wwii , the old man was in tears and said `` it 's beautifull to see german and french soldiers together wherease they were killing each others 50 ago . '', 
  [ best version ever !,

  i watch the army parade , i organize a barbecue with friends then in the evening i watch the local firework .

  [ france 24 ] ( http://m.france24.com/en/20150503-arms-sales-becoming-france-new-el-dorado-but-what-cost-francois-hollande-saudi-arabia-rafale ) says 15 billion and [ l'opinion ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/edition/international/ventes-d-armes-en-2015-france-a-battu-tous-records-94914 ) ( french ~ ~ economic ~ ~ newspaper ) says 16 billion . 
  eddit : and daily sabbah seems to be a pro akp turkish newspaper . 
  erdogan and the akp also moved to secure a more reliable english language newspaper mouthpiece . 
  the result is daily sabah , a new publication affiliated with the mass circulation sabah , which was owned by erdogan 's son-in-law until he sold it to an equally loyal company last year . 
  essentially composed of thinly veiled government press releases , daily sabah is actually quite useful as an english-language window into the akp 's thinking -- a slicker version of what so many turks read every day . 
  there are only 3 players who were not born in france ( evra , mandanda and umtiti ) , and they had came in france before they were 2 or 4 years old . 
  on the other side , the rugby union french team had 7 foreign players ( from south africa , fiji and new zeland ) in the last world cup . 
  so this is english dumbass against french dumbass . 
  yes but we can find kurtoskalacs in many places in romania . 
  it 's seems to be integral part of their food culture . 
  it 's like the croissant in france , it 's a austrian pastry by origin . 
  last year i visited bucarest , brasov and the carpatians with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed it . 
  being french we could only speak english ( awfull english for me ) and say * bun\u0103 ziua * , * la revedere * , * mul\u0163umesc * ... 
  but the peoples were very nice , helpfull , and your nature is just wonderfull . 
  also we loved k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs , so tasty !, 
  bad things about romania were the public transport ( but cheap ) and the fact that in bucarest there are many beautifull buildings nearby communist constructions or oversized advertisements , so sorrowful . 
  du [ boursin ] ( http://www.finecooking.com/assets/uploads/posts/5108/ing-boursin-cheese_sql.jpg ) ? 
  this is delicious . 
  a little boursin on your baguette , with cherry tomatoes , p\u00e9charmant wine , and you have a good ap\u00e9ro !, 
  do they are always on stikes and surrender if there is a war ?

  yes this the same helicopter but not for the same purpose . 
  the super puma is the public version wherease the caracal is the military version . 
  currently saint-anne square is not so nice because of the construction of the subway ...

  i think salers is a too salty cheese . 
  i prefer a cantal vieux or a saint-nectaire from the same region . 
  french guiana are not ethnically french foremost , french citizenship is not based of the ethnic group . 
  all peoples from french guiana , martinique guadeloupe , new-caledonia , corsica or france are french citizens . 
  after french guiana is part of france for longer than roussillon , alsace , moselle , savoie , corsica or county of nice . 
  [ white wine master race ] ( http://www.arnaudslanguagekitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sancerre-et-chavignol.jpg ) !,

  [ jacques hammeur laughing ] ( https://youtu.be/a6eow7xojbm?t=6 ) . 
  i remeber from the school that it was richelieu who began the centralisation by creating the first universal and centralized tax during the french wars or religion . 
  mostly agriculture , agri-food industry , services and tourism . 
  otherwise in villefranche-de-rouergue , 25 minutes from najac by car , there is a lisi aeropsace factory [ ( 20 000 m \u00b2 , 700 employees ) ] ( http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/lisi-aerospace-inaugure-sa-nouvelle-usine-a-villefranche-de-rouergue.n458562 ) . 
  yeah but like we say in france , * it 's the asshole of the world * ( location in the middle of nowhere ) .
