  remind me the multiple tiny and cute orthodox churches of bucharest . 
  but i do n't like this kind of big church , not to mention the corruption surrounding its construction,

  welcome to oostende/ostende the ugliest part of belgium . 
  while going 20 km to the west you can discover the beautifull city of [ brugge/bruges ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/9b/2f/50/bruges.jpg ) !, 
  according to [ this website ] ( https://www.dunedupilat.com/english/the-dune/dune-du-pilat/ ) , pilat comes from the [ gascon language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gascon_language ) `` pil\u00e0t '' wich means a heap or a mound . 
  i do n't know if you understand my point , but about about the attacks in france since 2012 ( toulouse , charlie hebdo , saint-quentin-fallavier , 13 november/bataclan , magnanville , saint-etienne-du-rouvray , nice ) 11 men were french , 2 belgian , one franco-tunisian and two iraqi . 
  the french and belgian men were born in france/belgian as french/belgian , and they grow in france and belgium . 
  yes they were from magreb origin , but maybe they lived in europe since one , two or tree generations . 
  i do n't know if you are french or not but in france each people who is born here is french . 
  these mens have become radicalized in europe and that 's where we have to be uncompromising with religious radical groups and to allocate more resources to intelligence services . 
  yes car burnings still happen and i 'm not okay with this , but it happen mostly in ghetto and poorest suburb , not in central paris or everywhere in france . 
  i only see car burnings at new year 's eve on tv , newspaper or radio . 
  i had never seen this with my own eyes whereas i lived in paris suburb and now in big city of brittany . 
  it is not like it was riots at every new year . 
  attackers had foreign origin from maghreb but were born , grown and educated in france ( except the franco-tunisian of nice and the two iraqui men ) . 
  commited by-non french toulouse attack was commited by a french , like charlie hebdo and hyper casher attacks . 
  in the 13 november attack of paris there were 8 french , 1 belgian and 2 iraqi men . 
  the attack in nice was commited by a franco-tunisian . 
  paris has on average 100 car burnings a night by north african/muslim youth not paris but in suburbs , mostly located in seine-saint-denis in the case of ile-de-france wich is famous for being the poorest departments of france and a ghetto for immigrants . 
  the military is deployed and patrols everywhere yeah since 20 years it patrols in railway station , mails , touristic places , school and religious buildings , mostly in the biggest cities . 
  i left paris 6 month ago for a a big city of britanny and i had never see a military patrol here . 
  the french are losing their culture ahahahah good joke . 
  also their safety more a feeling than a reality , but i understand this argument .

  i ate in the restaurant on the left with the orange front . 
  i was a little disapointted , i do n't recommend it . 
  i was travelling in romania last year with my girlfriend , saying * multsumesc * to the customs officers , waitress , receptionists , but i did n't know that i could use * mersi * like in french . 
  i was reffering at european union , not the continent . 
  it 's funny because the platform is never shown on tv or picture , and the first time i travelled near the fort boyard i said : `` what the fuck is that !? 
  does it is the bridge near patras ? 
  i remember my last trip in greece 9 five years ago the bridge was impressive , like al ot of thing in peloponese ( mycena , epidaure , corinth canal , forest fire ) . 
  and chilling one week in zakhyntos island was the laziest and best thing . 
  serbia also buy [ european armament ] ( http://www.airbushelicopters.com/website/en/press/republic-of-serbia-orders-nine-h145m_2066.html ) ... 
  you forgot [ the offshore platform ] ( http://i86.servimg.com/u/f86/15/75/35/01/12934910.jpg ) !, 
  yes kebab are fast food , they dish up sandwichs as fat as american fast food and i did n't say they are the best . 
  i said that i prefer with my mates to eat kebab than in a mcdonald or burger king . 
  it 's cheaper , waiters are more friendly and specially there are always a kebab in the center of the city whereas mcdonald are often located ouskirt of the city . 
  til there are free refills in few fast food in france . 
  anyway i prefer to eat in a kebab or sandwich restaurant , where there no free refills , than in a fast food . 
  fuck i 'm too hungry now . 
  it 's funny because some french overseas departments ( like martinique or guadeloupe ) were french long before alsace , roussillon , lorraine , savoie or nice .

  do they have a delicious dish made with [ french fries/chips and cheese curds topped with a light brown gravy ] ( http://poutinewar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/poutine.jpg ) ? 
  til a region of italia speaks french !, 
  why french on aosta ? 
  it 's their natural strategy , stood on their island and waited for the russians to do the job . 
  the did the same with napol\u00e9on . 
  the [ gulf war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_war#france ) i think . 
  but currently france has 10 600 troops in foreign countries and 8 100 in overseas territories . 
  as my fellow citizens says inside paris you do n't need a car but in the suburb it depends where you live . 
  near paris you have still metro , tram , suburb train and rer , and far from you have just suburb train and rer . 
  somes train lines are worst than others . 
  i remember the on-time train rate goes from 79 % ( rer a ) to 95 % ( metro , rer e ) . 
  if you live in the suburb a car is necessary for common living , but not to go working in paris . 
  it 's more convenient to park his car at trainstation and take the public transport . 
  you mean the `` highway '' or the road on the right ? 
  because on the `` highway '' our taxi exceeded widely 50 km/h . 
  even in bucharest center , the taxi exceeded 50 km/m . 
  one day we had a very skilled driver because he could drive fastly , shwitch lanes on road , talk on phone and set on the gps at the same time . 
  roads are weird in romania . 
  i remembered the `` highway '' between bucarest and the otopeni airport . 
  [ how do you enter in this higway when peoples drive at 90 km/h ? 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bqs1u ) it 's scary , especially when you 're in a taxi wich has no belts for backseat . 
  but is was is very nice trip !, 
  both have been in position of power , both have been tried macron is new in the politics . 
  he was just a economy minister for 2 years under valls government and his disagreements with ps and lr make him rather popular .
