  sweden : [ snow therapy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nndahhrb_nu ) , funny and socially interesting . 
  belgium : [ au nom du fils ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjtyaf4henc ) , starts as a social movie , finish like a tarantino movie . 
  do not watch if you are catholic fundamentalist . 
  spain : [ tambi\u00e9n la lluvia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfozf1atubu ) , hispanic coproduction with a spanish realisator . 
  f fascinating movie about history and social south america . 
  [ ocho apellidos vascos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpnoq1vulu0 ) , great comedy movie , even more if you understand spanish language . 
  as frenchman from belgian origin , when i think of belgium i think foremost about food , beer , and food . 
  pain \u00e0 la grecque is delicious , waterzooi too , the best beer comes from bruxelles ( gueuze cantillon < 3 ) and i 'm unhappy because i ca n't find mitraillette for the lunch or sirop de li\u00e8ge for breakfast in paris . 
  it was the official name of a new stalker game . 
  maybe they considered clear sky and call of pripyat as spin off . 
  see news about gsc game world . 
  expect a development recovery of stalker 2 . 
  in fact it 's just politics . 
  they have always been offensive , foolish and naughty . 
  this is how they describes themselves . 
  ( and i think they are less truculent than in the seventies ) . 
  personally i think it 's funny . 
  but you do n't have to take the face value of the caricature . 
  the drawings always go with a lots of text with reflexion and criticize . 
  there is always a second meanings of the caricature . 
  it is not just offensive caricature to be offensive . 
  so yes they are nasty , but in france just few peoples criticized charlie hebdo for the offensive caricatures ( mostly hard religious people ) . 
  it was seen as free speech and if people did n't like they did n't buy or talk about it . 
  in fact a lot of people just did n't care/think but since the attacks they have a new audience wich is not familiar with charlie hebdo . 
  and as a frenchman i just do n't understand the critics against the drawings , because it 's new to me . 
  thank for the correction !,

  [ as a frenchman , my choice is already done ] ( http://i.imgur.com/loikgca.jpg ), 
  my grandmother who comes from belgium still use [ saindoux ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/saindoux ) , a kind of pork fat , for the cooking . 
  i think it 's common in the north and est of france . 
  do a couque means `` viennoiserie '' in belgium/wallonia ? 
  because as french tourist , a couque is [ this thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/couque_de_dinant ) very hard to eat . 
  [ french priority ] ( http://media.koreus.com/201606/inondations-homme-bagette.jpg ) . 
  73 $ is the price for all zone pass ( zone 1 to 5 , 1 is paris , 5 is the furthest suburb ) . 
  a round trip ticket from zone 5 to paris costs 8 $ circa , so 73 $ is quicly profitable . 
  futhermore 50 % discount is only available on anual pass . 
  in paris it 's 73 $ a month for m\u00e9tro , train and bus . 
  but 50 % is supported by universitaries for students or by companies for employees . 
  so for a lot of people it cost only 36,5 $ . 
  yeah i love [ nofx ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=3z9jqluwzfm ) too . 
  as a student for the lunch i can eat at the universitary restaurant wich propose pizza , steakhouse and always 2 traditional dish : quiche , ratatouille , blanquette de veau , white wine mussles , cassoulet , gratin dauphinois , beef bourguignon , pot-au-feu , basque , basque chicken ... vive les plats r\u00e9gionaux !, 
  edit : casse-cro\u00fbte is also a common way to eat fastly in france : baguette sandwich , croque-monsieur , salad .

  thanks . 
  it makes me sad too when we have to demolish nice buildings ( it reminds me noisy castle in belgium ) but we have to be realistic/pragmatic . 
  what he tries to explain is these churchs were built in the 18 century just by copying 12/13 century gothic architecture . 
  this church was in abbeville , a city of 23 000 inhabitants of picardie , not a rich region , and in abbeville there are already 6 churchs built ( [ saint-vulfrain ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9glise_saint-vulfran_d%27abbeville ) , [ notre-dame-de-la-chapelle ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9glise_notre-dame-de-la-chapelle_d%27abbeville ) , [ saint-s\u00e9pulcre ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9glise_saint-s\u00e9pulcre_d%27abbeville ) , [ saint-gilles ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9glise_saint-gilles_d%27abbeville ) , [ saint-pierre-et-saint-paul ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/prieur\u00e9_saint-pierre-et-saint-paul_d%27abbeville ) and [ saint-silvin ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9glise_saint-silvin_de_mautort ) ) . 
  so because of the drop of church attendance ( unused for 5 years ) , the high cost of repair ( church was in ruin ) , compare to the 6 others church that the city has to maintain ( wich were built from 11 to 15 century ) , they decide to demolish this church . 
  of course we are not going to demolish all these church not interesting in term of history or achitecture ( sainte-chapelle is a chef-d'oeuvre of 13 century and parliament of budapest is unique in hongria , and it 's a parliament ) . 
  but we are not going to maintain all these churchs . 
  edit : sorry for my awfull english . 
  i agree . 
  my grandparent are true catholic and were very hapyy when i brought them an icon from my trip in romania . 
  a french could `` satan va * in the meaning of '' you are satan '' . 
  it 's quite uncommon but not impossible, 
  as we say * c'est de bonne guerre / it 's fair enough * . 
  my bad . 
  at least they are both blue cheese . 
  from your country , i really love the [ t\u00eate-de-moine ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/girolle_7910.jpg ) . 
  ossau comes from [ a valley ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ossau_valley ) and iraty from [ a forest ] ( https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/for\u00eat_d'iraty ) . 
  i think the sheep cheese is pretty old , and the name is under protection of an aop/aoc since 1980 . 
  i think you mislead with etorky cheese , wich is just a brand of industrial basque sheep cheese . 
  they ca n't use the name ossau-iraty so they put a similar name . 
  and why ? 
  [ ossau-iraty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ossau-iraty ) , [ fourme d'ambert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourme_d%27ambert ) and [ pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pont-l%27%c3%89v%c3%aaque_cheese ) worth it !, 
  he likes the cochin-chinese , the malagasy , the maroccans , the senegalese . 
  so he is your friend , and now he is your lucky charm . 
  maybe we want to be burried in a wine cellars ? 
  it was very well-know but now it 's pretty old book . 
  and except fie that novel , the whriter is unknow . 
  i think planets of the apes and the kwa\u00ef river bridge ( writer is pierre boulle ) are more well-know novel from this time . 
  i 'm hungry now . 
  [ sarladaise potatoes ] ( https://www.academiedugout.fr/images/52093/948-580/visuel_pomme_de_terre_sarladaises.jpg?poix=50&amp;poiy=50 ),

  ah , i thought you were talking about the sale from alstom to stx . 
  saint-nazaire shipyard were ` nt sold during hollande presidency , it was under chirac/sarkozy .

  be carefull , the french brand `` jambon d'aoste '' comes from [ aoste , is\u00e8re department in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aoste,_is%c3%a8re ) , not from the aoste valley .

  i 'm disappointed ... 
  the belgium triptych : shit , pee and menstrual periods !, 
  yeah , it were hard times ... 
  not all the nobles were the enemies of the revolution , some were in favor of the revolution . 
  for example [ louis-philippe d'orl\u00e9ans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_philippe_i ) , duke of chartres , cousin of louis xvi ( and the next french king ) was a partisan of the revolution and took part in the [ battle of valmy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_valmy ) , the first great victory of the young republic !, 
  although there were collobration vichy france never took part in any fight alongside with germany , except when it was attacked ( syria -- lebanon campaign , operation torch ) . 
  i was expecting [ discours de la servitude vonlontaire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discourse_on_voluntary_servitude ) by la bo\u00e9tie ...

  place de l'\u00e9toile is a roudabout . 
  a roundabout ( rond-point ) is a place where incomming cars have the priority . 
  the place where circulating cars on the rings have the priority are called rotary square of just rotary ( carrefour \u00e0 sens giratoire ou giratoire ) . 
  because driving priority rules ( priority to the right ) on rotary square they are indicated by this [ panel ] ( https://www.google.fr/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=0ahukewij89ujl9vuahura1akhy61ameqjbwiba&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fsophie882.o.s.f.unblog.fr%2ffiles%2f2014%2f12%2fpanneau-rond-point.jpg&amp;psig=afqjcngtmvruyk9jk0viwkzrt1bxm3p6ng&amp;ust=1498555198234742 ) .
