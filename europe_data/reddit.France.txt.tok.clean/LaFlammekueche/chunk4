  laurent collet-billon , [ heads of the dga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/direction_g\u00e9n\u00e9rale_de_l%27armement ) said in a newspaper that [ the next french army tank will be a franco-german tank ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/blog/secret-defense/char-futur-sera-franco-allemand-121602 ) of the knds joint-venture .

  i have read somewhere ( on a military blog/website ) that the future kant tank will have the turret and gun designed by the french and the engine and frame by the german .

  near paris there are the `` new city '' of saint-quentin-en-yvelines , marne-la-vall\u00e9e , or evry .

  what did he get wrong ? 
  when it 's say that only 4 % of people are satisfied of hollande , there is a misconception because of the question of the poll . 
  the old polls had twice answer `` satisfied '' or `` insastified '' . 
  with this sort of poll , [ hollande have 22 % of satisfied peoples ] ( http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20170319.afp9615/cote-de-popularite-hollande-en-hausse-cazeneuve-en-baisse.html ) . 
  the new poll introduce a new answer `` hesitant '' , with a result of 26 % of hesitant people and 4 % satisfied . 
  the fact is that this new apllie since 2015 , so only hollande have this sort of poll , and his result is not comparable with the previous president ( sarkozy , chirac , miterrand which had a lot of unsatisfied people . 
  with this poll it 's true that hollande have 4 % satisfied people , but it is not the lowest rate of the 5th republic .

  yeah but wikipedia gives this definition of monarchy a monarchy is a form of government in which a group , usually a family called the dynasty , embodies the country 's national identity and one of its members , called the monarch , exercises a role of sovereignty . 
  technically this definition apllies to napoleon .
