1998 world cup , 3-0 against brazil , and at home . 
  meta question : why is there so many eastern european on this thread , compared to the usual ? 
  i see no one from germany , uk or france . 
  to answer to your question , unlike / u/dclauzel , i 'm fluent in english , y hablo un poco de espa\u00f1ol , pero es une lengua que ha aprendado en mi liceo . 
  i do n't speak german , italian , or portuguese . 
  the one i went to in hawaii was terrible . 
  `` aloha snackbar '' it was called . 
  corsica and pays basque had a couple whackos blowing up some police stations for independence , but nothing never really came out of it . 
  we sure do . 
  we have a lot of shitty american shows ( stuff like storage wars ) , but we still make a french voice-over for them . 
  99 % of the cable movies channels are in french , with the very rare vostfr . 
  france television only uses french shows that they made . 
  most of the other channels uses foreign stuff with voice-overs . 
  we do learn english , but it 's usually with a french teacher who learnt how to teach english in a teacher academy . 
  i 'd consider myself an outlier because i 've learnt english with an american teacher when i was in china , which helped a lot . 
  is that true ? 
  fun fact : you know which city has the second largest portuguese population ? 
  paris with 240,445 portuguese people . 
  third is porto , 237,584 people . 
  even if you include municipalities , paris is in 5 ^ th place . 
  so you 're a part of the migrant problem . 
   in terms of animal welfare , the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two . 
  what is more , it does n't just live in the sense of existing , it lives a full and natural life . 
  those years are spent free roaming in the * dehesa * , the lightly wooded natural pastureland which is the residue of the ancient forests of spain . 
  alexander fiske-harrison on average , 10.000 bulls are killed for bullfighting in the world there 's a lot lot more killed for meat . 
  only in the usa , usda counts 35 million cattle killed for meat . 
  actually ancient greek for `` mouse ear '' . 
  swiss strategy is : no one gives a fuck about mountains , and all politicians have their cash in there anyways . 
  i , for one , like roman numbers . 
  linkedin is nearly only for business stuff . 
  not really for friends . 
  google + only has 500m users because you need an account to have a youtube account . 
  pretty sure nearly no one uses g + . 
  they are currently doing that . 
  but you do n't have a lot of sheep near paris . 
  it 's also kinda hard to find melons in strasbourg . 
  and do n't even start talking about cows in the south . 
  still ca n't be influential over brazil . 
  yeah , but it 's 50 km/h rail . 
  do n't remind me nightmares . 
  not really balkans , but took 10 hours to go from bucarest to timisoara by train . 
  ergh . 
  fun fact : there are more japanese restaurants than mcdonalds in france . 
  but most of them are independant . 
  if you think that 's an issue , wait for someone to point the difference between great-britain , the united kingdom , and the british island . 
  france gives a kinda detailed card ( something like 20 places ) but only gives north/south when it comes to further forecasts ( 5-15 days ), 
  was that the wurst comment you could come up with ? 
  top kek * gateau du haut *, 
  you are now a moderator of / r/rance, 
  which means it 's definitively not latvian . 
  such is life . 
  what would a german know about funny ? 
  not only the southern ones . 
  beaches in normandy are still crowded by brits and dutchs . 
  you know that the d-day has ended 70 years ago ? 
  public transport in paris is actually not much of a problem . 
  even during strikes , there is a minimal service , which means that subways will be slightly more crowded than usual , but that 's it . 
  the real evil is the trains . 
  when these guys go on strike , you can just walk to your destination . 
  will still be faster . 
  there is actually a substance that is specially unpalatable to some people in brussel sprouts . 
  some ca n't eat them , but some others , like me , actually like that . 
  12 # = 16.32 $ he is still right . 
  you ca n't find a *** well cooked *** steak and a good beer for 15 $ on the island . 
  the fun fact behind that is that he actually ca n't have a straight tie , mostly because of a spine problem , and the fact that he has a shorter leg . 
  jean-marie le pen is the previous leader of front nation , a french far-right political party . 
  the guy is known for his ... let 's say ~ ~ controversial ~ ~ radical opinions on the holocaust , homosexuality , and aids . 
  although you better have a couple shots loaded , or a very steady aim . 
  a boar is a frikking resilient animal if you do n't shoot it in the belly or the head . 
  i agree that anything pertaining to uk has nothing to do on a *** continental *** subreddit . 
  / r/france is actually really nice . 
  just watch out , and always say * pain au chocolat * for `` chocolate croissant '' . 
  although they would need to turn it sideways , and cut it to the right size . 
  no major problem . 
  to anyone saying that piracy ca n't be fought , steam is the perfect counter-example . 
  no videogame publishers would sell in russia , because of the crazy high piracy levels . 
  but no one would buy his games in russia , because the prices would be crazy high compared to the local wages . 
  so what was valve 's idea ? 
  make all steam games 40-60 % cheaper in russia . 
  and what happened ? 
  piracy rates went down . 
  hey . 
  we dodged the worse . 
  if algeria had won against germany , the next match would have been france/algeria . 
  yup burning cars everywhere . 
  i 'm thinking of a bad pun with sarky/sarkozy . 
  maybe ? 
  catalan is the bastard child of french and spanish . 
  perfect case of a nimb guy . 
  i remember the year when they blocked the highway to the airport of their strike . 
  pissed off everyone for a week . 
  ok ... this title is some fucking clickbait if i 've ever seen some . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but france had what was called sto ( * service du travail obligatoire * / mandatory labour service ) young men were conscripted to work in german farms/factories in germany , to `` pay '' the cost of the war against france . 
  the eurozone was a good idea when you had countries with economies of similar levels , and which would complete each other . 
  that was in a eli5 recently . 
  you say it the spanish way , but write it the french way . 
  to be fair , we both hate the brits ... but you beat us at rugby ... tough choice . 
  you know where google news gets a lot of its content ? 
  agence france presse . 
  the third biggest news agency in the world , biggest in europe .
