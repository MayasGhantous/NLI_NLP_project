oh you 're completely right , with res giving me an adequate enough thumbnail , i did n't bother opening the picture to read the tiny letters . 
  lazy me . 
   you still study english at school , but it 's obviously meaning that french is the most widely studied foreign language in the uk . 
  we 're talking about the 2nd foreign language . 
  so i 'd guess it 's probably second to german . 
  or scouse . 
  i know telhe article is about scotland , but apart from a couple of very expensive places ( including one - i 'm not kidding - on cheval street ) , i do n't remember eating lamb that ever tasted like lamb or mutton in london . 
  after a while i stopped ordering lamb , the damn thing was always too spongy . 
  so in a way , i 'm worried about the 2/3 of places that did n't cheat and still ended up with horrible lamb meat in their dishes . 
  * cough * . 
  portugal ** is ** a developed country . 
  i mentioned the universal schooling of 3 year-olds . 
  but we also have long maternity leaves with compensation , 1 day a week paid at least 100 % of minimum wage if you have 2 kids or more and stay at home that day ( for mom or for dad , actually ) , tax incentives to pay people to take care of your kids after school , and so on . 
  i do n't know the austrian model , but i do know that the german one failed to curb the low birth rate because they ended-up focusing too much on the mom-at-home model , and not enough on the mom-at-work one . 
   sub-replacement birth rates are not really high ( currently 2 , 2.1 would be replacement ) . 
  also i think it would be high time to measure the quality of births . 
  is it the middle-class family having 2 kids , or they have 0 and it is the toilet cleaner family having 4 ? 
  it 's a good remark . 
  and actually , this is one place where france gets it right . 
  instead of paying people to stay at home with their kids , we encourage them in all kind of manner to get back to work . 
  one of them is by having a very comprehensive set of daycare solutions for the kids . 
  almost all 3 year-olds go to school ( ok , just 93 % of them actually ) . 
  and in most cities , they can be dropped as early as 7am and picked back at 7pm . 
  this is the key to encourage not just the lower-income people to have kidsm , but the middle-class too . 
  i could n't find stats for the whole of france , but partial ones for the nord-pas-de-calais ( please do n't laugh fellow frenchmen ) do n't show a massive difference in the family sizes between low-income ( 26 % have 3 kids or more ) and high-income families ( 18 % of them ) . 
   do n't be ridiculous , i get emails from our paris subsidiary written 22:00 saturday . 
  workweek laws may have an effect on blue-collar people , but i 've yet to see any ambitious white-collar person with an aim to get into management give any fuck about workweek laws in any country . 
  if there is a clock , they clock out , and go right back . 
  well , first , let 's ignore the millenials generation and their different outlook on that . 
  you 're right , the white collar people have mostly a different scheme : they work long hours , do n't clock actually , but get back days off in-lieu . 
  we call them the `` rtt '' . 
  in most companies , that 's about 10-15 days a year . 
  you thus end up with 35-40 days of holidays in total . 
  and almost everyone takes them all . 
  just like by law , you 're not supposed to have less than a 45 minutes lunch break , and it 's very rare to see people not taking an hour for lunch . 
  again , your paris office manager is an exception here . 
  i think you get france wrong . 
  lawyers , surgeons , nurses , senior managers , they work long hours . 
  the rest of the country , a bit less so . 
  like most managers , your workaholic paris office manager is not representative of the millions of teachers , cashiers , builders , paper pushers , etc. 
  and as i said , the newer generation - in france just like elsewhere - is a bit less prone in spending its life at the office than the previous one . 
  there are a few issues with the article . 
  for a start , it compares france to germany . 
  the countries do n't have the same profile , we do n't export the same kind of things . 
  heck , we do n't even consider ourselves a mostly-industrial country anymore . 
  as far as exporting countries go , germany is a powerhouse . 
  it 's # 2 in the world , in front of the us , and manages to export in value 3/4 of what china does . 
  france should more be compared to its other neighbors : spain , italy , uk . 
  and then it gets a bit more favorable . 
  my personal opinion is that there 's also probably some cyclical or conjectural things going on . 
  the heavy industry in france ( planes , power-plants , that kind of things ) probably suffer more of the crisis than luxury german cars do . 
  but that 's of course not all that germany produces . 
  now , having said that , the competitiveness issue has long been identified , and it is one of the main challenges considered by this government . 
  alas , as boromir 's meme would say , one does not simply switch social policies financing into vat overnight . 
  the way we finance our social security , our families policies , even our retirement pensions is to do it with taxes that apply on salaries , instead of applying them as vat or as income tax . 
  as long as we export as much as we import , there 's no big final difference between doing one or the other on a macro level , as french workers are french consumers and vice-versa . 
  but of course , with a negative trade balance , the french worker ends up costing more than the foreign one , and the foreign products end up costing less . 
  alas , switching from one system of financing to the other though is tricky , because when removing the taxes on salaries , the employers might not give back the difference in wage to their employees . 
  and on the other hand , the shops would still all get their prices going up . 
  as the article says , performing this kind of change probably requires a growing economy , and now is apparently not the right moment . 
  finally , we are a socialist country . 
  deal with it . 
  we do have a high birth-rate because we do have lavish family policies . 
  we do have the # 1 healthcare system in the world because we do spend a lot of money on it ( i mean , the first thing that came to my mind when i broke my leg was : thanks god i 've broke it in france ) . 
  and we only work 35hours a week , because work is strenuous , you know . 
  though apparently some say that we compensate that by a high productivity and not spending too much time on reddit during working hours . 
  they 're wrong apparently . 
  should we be the ones to spend less on our social policies , or should it be instead the rest-of-the-world that should start spending a bit more ? 
  i let you decide . 
  in any case , it 's pointless to compare the amount of government spending with other countries : we are not another country , we are la r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise , une et indivisible . 
  you know how they extinguish oil well fires ? 
  with explosives . 
  le marcel with cheese . 
  you know , because of the metric system . 
  do n't worry . 
  they 're all just jealous that [ they do n't have ** their ** bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pont_du_gard ) on the 5 $ note . 
  i thought so too ( it 's quite well known that there are people that do pay their car in cash in germany , which is probably impossible in france ) . 
  but it 's not a german specificity : http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/art2_mb201104en_pp79-90en.pdf ( page 85 ), 
  i , for one , am definitely waiting for the 1 trillion dollar platinum coin . 
  i wonder which dead president they 'll put on it . 
  i always preferred the commonwealth approach of regularly updating the design with actually living people . 
  plus , with the right folds , you can get queen lizzy to smile or to frown . 
  you want us to go to albufeira so that we get punched by the rowdy brits , dutch and germans ? 
  how _ european _ of you . 
  10 million in salary . 
  the solution is simple : do n't . 
  get it in stock-options . 
  or just reinvest it in a tax-free way ( using real estate , or investing in one of te overseas territory ), 
  can you tell me which word you do n't understand in `` partial responsibility '' ? 
  as for the other ( blatantly overlooked ) factors , i 'm afraid you 'll have to be clearer if you 're trying to make racist assumptions ... 
  yeah , it 's obvious that we did n't hear about it in french media , because nina only reported it to the newspaper `` lib\u00e9ration '' which is not a media , and is not widely read either . 
  even le monde does n't talk about it , except , well , [ when they talk about it ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/09/18/le-calvaire-de-nina-victime-de-viols-collectifs-dans-sa-cite_1761704_3224.html ) having said that , on the case of `` les tournantes '' , i think the media collectively decided to cover things a bit differently ( just like they did with the new-years car fires ) , following the many complaints about their coverage of it about 10 years ago : http://www.melchior.fr/quand-les-medias-redecouvrent.7870.0.html they are also usually complex cases , where there is no simple narrative . 
  often , the victims were already part of the group ( i 'm not saying they were consenting !, 
  i 'm saying they were linked to the guys ) and the worldviews of the rapists were distorted enough by all the crap they get to see on tv about women `` liking it '' . 
  it 's hard for the tv media to come to terms to their partial responsibility to the way they 've distorted the ethics of these youths . 
  an old town in stockholm ? 
  you mean gamla stan ? 
  dude , you 've never been to marble arch , have you ?

  how do you say trianon in english ?
