  they weight around 15 % . 
  a part of far left is also pro-putin , but only because they are anti american . 
  if tommorow , obama would praise putin they would say putin is a lesser devil and praise whatever america is fighting . 
   it is hard to be anti-zionist if jews can not feel safe in germany , france , libya ... 
  they were forced out of libya since a long time : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_libya#six-day_war, 
  in the [ film about fofanna affair ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_jours ) , they said they singled jewish shops by seing which ones were closed on saturday . 
  6 % per year is huge . 
  it would take less than 20 year for all jews to flee . 
  yeah ... [ that was an actual kgb desinformation campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_infektion ), 
  russia has supported wacko style wackos for some time already . 
  russian proapganda support or make conspiracy theories and russian paid trolls help to porpagate them . 
  a russia today report on ukraine , ? 
  should be quite factual and totally not propaganda . 
  you have also this weird a\u00df letter that is supposed to replace two `` s '', 
  if germany can make cars that detect controls and reduce emissions just for them , i dont think their engeinering quality is in question . 
   it wound up to be ** totally ** fake . 
  it ended true from the point of view of elton , which was indeed called by someone claiming to be putin . 
  information in russia is severly controlled , and we had many reports of captured soldiers and diseapearences in armed forces . 
  in the same way , the russian interventino in syria is undeniable . 
  there has been reports , satellites images , flightradar and diplomatic reactions , and while putinbot can claim each one is fake , sometime with ease , sometime with hypocrisy , the variety of evidence of russian deployement in syria is pretty much undeniable . 
  haaaa , its a very long time since i heard the traditional `` where is your proof '' so much nostalgy . 
  because they are our imediate neighbours . 
  are you high on krokodil ? 
  we are going to need more troops to recolonise it though now that most of their countries have armies . 
  actually , they mock anything . 
  this is not even a stunt but normal business for them . 
  thanks erdogan . 
  rome has even older democracy [ by that account ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_maurice ), 
  to add to the long list of far right conspiracy theories that emerged after this photo . 
  it is a possibility . 
  considering the situation it obviously a deliberate attempt by an organised group , and while far right group are not know to deploy this kind of tactics , russia is well know for using them often . 
  the article say they werent able to find any job and hence can not afford to live here . 
  being in a nice country is no fun when you are jobless and homeless . 
  [ i didnt knew about that ] ( http://graduatefog.co.uk/2014/3523/oxfam-internship-charity-uk-graduate-exhausted/ ), 
  too soon, 
  it is a ngo that often release really biaised reports with bogus statistics . 
  while there is an active debate about the situation , it is also clear that this `` shift '' seem everything but natural . 
  it may be a far fetched idea , but considering how the russian propaganda seems to have diseapeared , and considering the magnitude of the spaming in / r/europe , i wonder if it is an international operation . 
  having realised that his trolls were too obvious and would not manage to make europeans take the russian invasion for american imperialism , they may have shifted to an all out support for far right by pushing the immigration questions . 
  who else would have the mean to activate thousands of accounts daily to push the same article ? 
  surely not a group of far rights amateurs . 
  russia seem one of the few power with the interests and experience to pull this kind of stunt . 
   acording to oxfam reports made my day . 
   whatever thing this asshole made up in his mind somehow , i can think of the reason you got b &, 
  something like that ?

  bad youtube video : check already posted : check prepare to cry for censorship as this should be justly removed .

  while he is the subject of a massive witchhunt , he has also received some support from some / r/europe users . 
  i for one remember the same witchhunt against davidreiss666 and think the far right group will simply move to a next target , and while i had no idea of david 's flaw , i think dclauzel moderation is better than what / r/europe had before ( thread were supressed withouth any notification or justification ), 
  witch ones . 
  astuse de professionel : he has no idea of dclauzel religion and is just spitting hatred out of his keyboard . 
  this sub is heavily brigaded by far right groups and it is no wonder such people are banned . 
  because whitch hunts are largely innefective . 
  paging / u/dclauzel, 
  the taking of the kent . 
  robert surcouf was a privateer in east india and one day came in contact with the [ kent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_%281799_ship%29 ) . 
  being a lot bigger and with an exeptionally large crew ( they had rescued the crew of an other ship ) , the kent was confiant in his victory and convied his passenger to admire how a british warship would sink a french pirate ... 
  but srcouf was not the half of a seaman and he avoided the kent canons while closing the distance and finally boarded her . 
  after a short fight , the kent was taken and the admirality faces matched for once the colour of their coat . 
  * i just found funny the way the news came in block . 
  it must be the wave ( of immigration huhu ) of the afternoon . 
  * * any idea why these thematics usually come at thoses hours ? 
  angela merkel is one of the very few politician which could look a migrant in the eye and tell her the harsh thruth instead of the usual emotional bullshit . 
  turks just * claimed * today to have killed 771 kurds . 
  i think the point is that rice and such are generally unperishable goods that are hence not usually wasted by supermarkets . 
  they would have a hard time making logistics for perishable clod stored goods . 
  the petition had a sucess , but the law has been a failure and has been cancelled by the constitutional court . 
  that is what i mean . 
  even this small greek island is two times bigger than the whole channel island . 
  anyway you take it , size is not the matter . 
  or did you want to spin it back to airport size ? 
   so your evidence is , they 're german , not greek , therefore they 're better ? 
  why do i even write to trolls ? 
  seriously , even lemnos is twice as big as the whole channel island and you are just spitting thing out of your ignorance . 
   is there any evidence that such contracts that have n't been happening so far would start happening now ? 
  * `` where is your proof '' * seriously , german groups have a lot more connexion and marging to negociate than a greek public employee . 
   i do n't think the biggest problem with island airports is mismanagement , but size you have no idea of what you are talking . 
  i might not be an expert , but having know and used very small airports and heard story about them ( in an other country ) i doubt size is the limiting factor for an airport serviccing a couple of flight a day as some are just a runway , a parking space for plane and car , and a metal hut with an automatic distributor for all restauration . 
  attracting clients for charters with negociated fees and advertisment is . 
  if a german group can buy these airports and then revitalise them with contract with charter agency in germany it could push some of them to profitability . 
  `` lawmaker '' no . 
  it is a front national deputy in the european parliement and i doubt he had any implication in any law that passed . 
  by the way , it is the main suspect in the front national forgein funding inquiry . 
   not to mention greece has no moral obligation who has an obbligation to accomodate migrants ? 
   criminals who are trespassing til immigration is literally a crime . 
  just like murder . 
  what is above me is why the accomplices did not steal the ferrari instead of burning it . 
  never put mayo on oil fried potatoes . 
  its like adding butter on beacon . 
  while ketchup is passable , the true condiment to fry is mustard . 
  it would be quite a coincidence if daesh and pkk did decide to strike the same day . 
  morover , islamic terrorism is quite renowed for its coordinated attacks . 
  well , if they want the total ammount of troops from every nato country yes , but when i hear nato troops , i would excepct to have a specific count of troops in designated nato corps , bases or operations . 
  213 000 nato soldier in france !, 
  they are actually counting the total of active french forces : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/forces_arm%c3%a9es_fran%c3%a7aises, 
  they also deported here the ukrainian here : [ source ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/ukrainian-refugees-to-repopulate-siberia/506624.html ) at least the part they did not manage to persuade to take arms to help their invasion : [ source ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2dretb/interesting_story_eastern_ukrainians_back_to/ ), 
  shooting on sight ... that is dangerous . 
  what if people did get lost ?
