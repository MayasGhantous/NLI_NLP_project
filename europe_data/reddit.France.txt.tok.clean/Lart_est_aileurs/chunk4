  so ... basically , colonisation ? 
  after georgia crimea and donbass , they would be quite naive not to prepare for a military conflict in transdinestria . 
  malta , because no one think of them . 
  both goal are linked . 
  if they are able to repel russia , it will be a serious blow to the russian occupation in transniestra . 
  we have one very active right now . 
  professor `` joyeux '' just launched a petition against measle vaccination . 
   a risk sharing mechanism that would have all the other states instantly pour money to a financially troubled one , greek spotted . 
  / s seriously . 
  while there is some sense in your third point , and allowing some states to pursue socialists or wellfare policies while other have a pro business low regulated can introduce heavy distortions in our economies , favoring the latests , a risk sharing mechanism is an appeal to irresponsability . 
  blaming mystical circles has little to do with differences between greece and germany as we share a currency and a free market . 
  a common minimum wage can be a good idea to decrease the difference between germany and greece , but germans wont abandon their full employement society . 
  you will to curb unemployement in your country more than they will have to increase their wellfare . 
  yes , and they are sponsoring ukrainians nazi against the totally democratic and indenpendant people of the donbass that arent a cover for the russian army and authoritaristic regime at all . 
  they were said to be quite racists though , but i certainely dont know tham as well as a belgian . 
  what about the vlamms belang ? 
  i was thinking `` lets negociate where the lava will be flowing '' but an economic crisis has more margin than a volcano . 
  a good analogy would be the baltimore mayor saying `` lets negociate the protests '', 
  oh , sorry , i did not mean it as an error , just the fact that tsiprass would like to negociate the term of an economic crisis would seem dellusional . 
   negotiate the terms of the crisis that is one really weird figure of speech though, 
  for a moment i did not see the link anymore ant thought he may have been deleted , as such thing are not uncomon in this sub , but it seem i was wrong . 
  edit : my bad . 
  i must have missed it . 
   the 19-nation bloc 's finance ministers were riled after greek prime minister alexis tsipras 's tried to bypass their veto on financial aid with an appeal to angela merkel on thursday . 
  how ironic . 
  after demonising germany and merkel , syriza 's last hope is merkel . 
  how deeper can he digg himself, 
  they did catch 5 attacks , ... but this news come only after they did not catch a sixth that was only caught by accident ( but he had the time to kill one person ), 
  i did mean that police departements , hospitals , have the mean to see who abused their databases and accessed personnal files for their distractions . 
  i wouldnt consider that an intelligence agency hasent the same kind of stuff . 
  you know , it is easy to makes system who track those using them . 
  people , dont be fooled by the conpiracy theorist that obviously didnt even bother to follow events and are mkaing things out of their a$ $ . 
  this comes after a wannabe terrorist was arrested because he hadent proper gun control . 
  of course now that they pass for amateurs they will say how effective they are . 
  it wouldnt be the first time a politician change its stance following events . 
  you have to live with today 's world . 
  create either / r/eurasiantreaty or / r/novorussia, 
  that should be a common practice . 
  deletion withouth reason often lead user to think of the worst . 
  yeah , he probably only eat meat in his dinner . 
  while i dont caution / r/europe politic of removal of controversial links , i dont think this can be blammed on one moderator . 
  by the way . 
  the semicowardly way you designate him make me feel consider its more like a witchhunt than a debate . 
  : use your real account if you have any balls . 
  the dutch one . 
  not since 2010 . 
   russia has never deny his support to the separatist movements how about you try ?

  itl : an inteligence general announce that the russian didnt have the logistical ability to fully invade ukraine , but dispatched units to fight ukrainian while claiming to be rebels . 
  that is the same sources sputinknews and other propaganda channel used restlessly these last day to imply there was no russian invasion in ukraine . 
  * does your country use the euro ? 
  yes * what do you think of the euro ? 
  its really usefull to travel other countries and still have a grasp of things values . 
  moreover , it is nice having a currency not on a constant inflationist spiral . 
  * how would you like to improve the euro ? 
  remove 1c and 2c coins * do you think the euro will still be around 20 years ? 
  yes , there will still be euros in 20 yaers , although it is possible that greece will not be a part of it anymore . 
  so , i guess tsiprass did not retunr * completely * empty handed after all . 
   i can link you plenty of videos with ukrainian soldiers next to bodies of the separatists with tied up hands . 
  please do . 
  actually , i think you misinterpreted the phrase in question . 
  there was a lot of euphoria in / r/europe as tsiprass was elected , and a lot of people were prentending he was going to change europe politics , and negociate with germany to form an wide anti austerity southern alliance . 
  but thing did not turn out as promised and he did quite a lot of political misshap , failing to collect any substancial support and antagonising germany . 
  while i dont know / u/kaptajnkaffe initial position on syriza , i understood that not as a hate for greek , but as he was `` runing out '' of his initial enthousiams . 
  moreover , his initial phrase is clearly an expression of sympathy for the greek people :  it must be pretty frustrating for greek redditors to see us focus so much on every sentence uttered by greek politicians . 
  edit : there may be greek bashing in the comments tree , but honestly , most of the people here express their frustration at tsiprass . 
  dude , i have nothing agaisnt greece . 
  if you are talking about [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31vnyx/tsipras_in_moscow_i_once_again_want_to_say_how/ ) , then the topic you are refereing to highlighted how ** tsiprass ** was a huge hypocrite saying one thing to germany and the opposite for russia . 
  the conclusion of my post was * `` can tsipras word even be trusted '' * it is a pretty straightforward critical of this politica lfigure . 
  if any critic of tsipras is deemed as greek hating , we should ban all critical of europeans leaders . 
  wow , just like half empty trucks are `` standard procedure '' for humanitarian aid ... seems russia has a lot of standard procedure that are very odd but very convenient do deny their dark schemes . 
  this thread seems to have been removed from / r/europe . 
  i am seriously at loss about why this did break any rule . 
  can any of you point me to the reason why this could have been removed ? 
  edit : its back on . 
   the deal is to set up joint russian and greek partnership to export agriculture products to russia well , that is mostly a gift for putin , and wont have a significant impact on greek economy  also tsipras walked away with a 40 + billion $ pipeline deal . 
  errr , that is quite far from your version , do you have any source for yours ? 
  edit : text about the pipeline in the guardian live thread :  it ended with a few comments on greece 's potential participation in the turkish stream pipeline project . 
  putin said nothing concrete was agreed , but greece could potentially earn millions of euros every year from the project . 
  well , it seem he came back empty handed anyway : [ rt ] ( https://ruptly.tv/vod/view/26651/russia-greece-was-forced-to-vote-for-sanctions-on-russia-says-putin )  we understand that greece had to vote for sanctions against russia . 
  and of course the counter sanctions hurt greece as well . 
  but it 's not our fault . 
  fifty percent of the imports to russia were agricultural products , but unfortunately ** we can not make any exceptions for countries inside the european union ** '' . 
  and russian squad accidently invade ukraine ... [ wait ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213 ) ( this was not accident , it was at the heart of the russian counter offensive ; the only error they commited was probably that they forgot to dump their uniforms and documents ), 
  what about their lower body ? 
  its like an unhealthy relationship , when the gf want to be dropped but hasent the courage to do so , and is hence making the life unsefferable . 
  this can go a long way if no action is taken , and she has the mean to crash the couple finance . 
  they are really trying hard to be kicked out . 
  what is he not saying is that having historical friendly ties with russia is perhaps the greatest danger for a country . 
  i honestly dont have a clue , but i am sure that both theory can not coexist ( islamic and european takeover ), 
  so , it is not an islamic takeover anymore , but a european one ? 
  [ reference ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_trojan_horse ), 
  if it is a correct exit , and if greece create a new currency while destroying its euros , this could be a painless measure for europe , and will not affect any budget . 
  but , if tsiprass decide to screw the eu and issue a new currency while keeping the current eu stash as a bonus , it could end in tears . 
  more likely , europe will declare any greek issued bill as a false currency and people will have to check the back of their coin and their banknotes numbers as a lot of `` false '' money with perfect quality will suddently be in circulation .
