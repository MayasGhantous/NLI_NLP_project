  * `` these are n't russian soldiers '' *, 
   if you post some news , but the source is not reliable , then we will remove it as such . 
  there 's only a very limited number of domains which we remove in this way though . 
  it 's virtually only the ones mentioned . 
  for instance , i do n't think it would be appropriate for a tubmlr source to be posted here in place of a real news website . 
  what about conspiracy theory and propaganda websites ? 
   it is not ok to suggest that members of different cultures or races are incapable of cohabiting . 
  so , on the discussion on the israeli conflict , we will have to be extra cautious i guess . 
   donbass wont back down if it does not get what it was promised . 
  resident of donbass dont always support the militia in place , and the militia often take brutal actions to repress thoses not in line with their ideas . 
  diseapearances in donesk are common , [ as this graph protestor ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/21/the-banksy-of-donetsk-documents-his-torture/ ) who was tortured it is difficult to hear from theses occupied places , but the liberation of sloviansk put the russian practices to light as dissident were imprisonned : [ 1 ] ( http://newpathway.ca/pavel-yurovs-sloviansk-captivity-the-theatre-of-the-absurd/ ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/journalist-leliavsky-returns-to-lviv-after-sloviansk-captivity-347587.html ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.mnogovbloge.com/?p=1976&amp;lang=en ) [ other werent so lucky as they were only found dead ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/dead-body-resembling-kidnapped-deputy-of-horlivka-council-found-in-sloviansk-344640.html ) so it is also a speculation to assume that the guys russia gave weapons speak for `` what donbass want '', 
  you seem to be mitaken . 
  you surely wanted to post tihs in / r/america or sometihng like that . 
   what makes you think the social issues of unemployment and so on would be stopped if all the muslims stopped coming nah , i think that unemployement hamper our integration ability , but most of the unemployemnt problem is from our social system indeed . 
  unemployement is rampant in the french society , even for people with diplomas as education is mostly free . 
  graduates will get also frustrated withouth jobs . 
  moreover most immigrant live in drugs ruled suburbs . 
  we should have a strict stop of non-european immigrant till the problem at home is treated . 
  we should then have a radical reduction of unemploement to stop , reduce benefits and destroy the drug network very hard , like for real , even put innmates to work to cut prion spending . 
  withouth unemployement and withouth drugs ruled cities the muslim already here can be integrated . 
  if these condition stay , they will not integrate in our society and we are on the way to bigger problems . 
  oh , pardon me , the vast majority of muslim are moderate and dont support such act , islam is a religion of peace , and those terrorists are no true muslim as koran forbid killing . 
  am i pc again ? 
  that it is not a reaction to a single event , but of a trend of confontation between islamic and western cultures . 
  9/11 ; madrid bombings ; london ; toulouse ; brussels museum ; charlie hebdo ; denmark , and that is not counting the one who were caught before . 
  and then they get `` defended '' by a country claiming dibs on you . 
  that sir was an urban legend . 
  it started as french used cement bombs . 
  their goal however was to limit civilian causalities when targeting tanks in urban aeras , as a direct hit was able to destroy a tank withouth destroying the neigborhoud . 
  considering how the french army did use to prepare for world war 3 , it is ridiculous to assume they would be out of bombs . 
   the war itself will be won or lost in the pontic-caspian steppe nothing can be certain for the new form of conflict . 
  who could have said that one wwii decisive battle would have been in egypt ? 
  morover , a full sclae war is not the only scenario , especially with nuclear weapons . 
  would russia try to conquer the baltic states while the threat of nuclear retaliation would be limiting actions in other theater ( `` you attack our cities and we nuke you '' ) , finland could be a great support against naval operations . 
   every protest having perfectly distinct and unique protestors it is the peak attendeas . 
  actually , this assume that it is the same protestor in every demonstration . 
  the number of unique portestor should be a lot higher . 
  actually , ukraine has a population of 44 millions . 
  if you take into account the high estimates of the protests all over ukraine , you are higher than 2 % http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan#protests_across_ukraine, 
   ... a lot more than there were ukrainians on the maidan . 
  basically , they would blame the jewish muslim neocon president for trying to undermine putin presidency with * rumors * about his disapearence while there is nothing happening , as putin is simply celebrating his newborn daughter , the military activity in moscow was a reharsal for a future parade and the fire near the kremlin was actually swamp gas . 
  and then / r/conspiracy was a shill, 
  / r/conspiracy is solely for conspiracies aimed at blaming jews/obama/unknow authorities, 
  you havent been there recently do you ? 
  while during euromaidan , / r/worldnews was following the ukrainian revolution , since putin war , there are many pro putin user saying literally the same thing under each news ( where is your proof , putin did nothing wrong , nato provoked russia , you say rt is propaganda , but non russian news are also propaganda ... ), 
  still more accurate than russian news . 
  or is busy supervising nemtsov murder investigation personnaly as he promised . 
  so , they are shocked that their bluff may have been called ? 
  wort poker player ever . 
  no wonder they are broke . 
  the fact that russia may be wroking on counter measures to possible additional sanctions should be logic , but i wouldnt bet a ruble that they are as ready as they pretend . 
  on the other hand , it did encourage putin to launch a similar operation in donesk , while the delay in putin invasion of donbass seem to have dissuaded him of launching overtaking in odessa and kharkiv , knowing they would likely be fought back and averted . 
  you are right . 
  it is just budapest memorendum signatories duty to ensure ukraine security . 
  they didnt sign it ... but it proves they were in the discussion and hint they were already set on not using diplomacy . 
  their position is not that advantagous . 
  i have an article about that ( its in french http://www.lopinion.fr/blog/secret-defense/en-ukraine-kremlin-a-t-il-reellement-moyens-militaires-ambitions-21830 ) they managed to invade crimea and to wreck donbass but overused their special troops and will not be able to subdue the whole ukraine . 
   their first action should have been to talk with the powerful neighbor sigh lavrov was in fucking ukraine when the [ agreement for yanoukovitch demission ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ukrainian_revolution#deal ) was signed and there was a case for him to sign in the document he did leave at blank . 
  russia refused to even talk to ukraine for month condiering that yanoukovitch was still the legitimate president and that the ukrainian authorities were a * fachist junta * ^ tm and european did everything to force russia into meeting ukraine while they were already invading cirmea . 
  saying that * ukraine * refused to talk to * russia * and not the opposite is orwelian . 
  edited to tune down my initial outburst . 
  i am sorry to sound agressive but orwellian grade reality dissorting had me quite angry . 
   no ... it 's because ukraine wanted to pick and continue a fight against an enemy orders of magnitude greater than itself god damn ... 
  even putin did not go as far as saying its troops were attacked in crimea , and ukraine proposed many cease fire with the russian troops in ukraine , how can one be so wrong and how can at least two people upvotes such a tinfoil comment !, 
  ukraine did not fire back in crimea and pretty much lost this region but putin moved on in dombass . 
  where do you think he will stop ? 
  do you want ukrainian to accept russian occupation just because they are weaker ? 
  i wouldnt be so positive . 
  first the russian troops attacked the urkrainian in delbasteve because they considered the cease fire didnt apply where they wanted not to apply it , and now they seem to attack [ towns near mariupol ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2yfsdq/ongoing_attack_on_shyrokyne_they_use_120mm/ ), 
  lithuania . 
  because although they are small they dont get fooled around : http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/ukraine-launches-joint-military-brigade-with-lithuania-and-poland-365343.html, 
  and you even managed to shoot down down a german with an one-liner, 
  itt : neoconspiracies theories about how the governement is an evil all knowing thing planing to destroy your liberties . 
  itd : publically available theorical study about how the criminal organisation could evolve in the future years . 
  wow , i did not heard about them since the cold war . 
  were they `` reactivated '' as putin seem to set a new one ? 
  yes please . 
  we could then make theories about how we had no interest to kill him and it must be a russian plot to blame europe . 
  seriously ... no . 
  the breitling team has more jets than them . 
  to `` central '' europeans add catholic values and resistance to russia . 
  the flying spagheti monster church isent a religion but a mockery of religion funded by atheists . 
  maybe the reason why the le pen familly had `` swiss accounts '' in panama was becasue they were nostalgic of the francs after all . 
  seriously , inflation is a very basic notion in economy , its like if you asked the source of someone saying how fire might burn . 
  you can see this notion in about any economy 101 manual . 
  their ability to create money dont prevent anyone from bankrupty ( and why central banks would be in this situation ; its the states that have deficits ) printing mass ammount of a currency destroy its value , and you only tranfer the losses to your citizen , but may still ultimately be bankrupt because it dosent reduce your debt in forgein money ( and when you are know for being printer happy , no one will lend you in the money you play with ), 
  not enough black and orange ribbons to my taste . 
  stupid westerners are ignorant and manipulated by russophobic propaganda . 
  western newspapers like this one are tryong to make a fuss about this man but it was a clown with no public support and putin had no reason to fear him . 
  in fact , his murder only desserve the regime . 
  westerner are aslo subject of propaganda and you should watch rt and sutniknews to have a complete vision of the situation as it less propaganda than insidious western oligarchic media . 
  moreover , where is your proof ? 
  some are so blinded by their belief that they will be perpetually surprised by stuff like that . 
  i am for a compromise . 
  what about greekbuthurtstan ? 
  and the french would still discard them and do as they want . 
  it is an older one that is probably already posted and dont mention this recalling . 
  a new article stating both the context and recent event will surely appear soon . 
  this article has literally no content . 
  here is an article with a bit of context : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-greece-migrants-protest-iduskcn0vw0yg,
