i believe that it is the presence of uncultured , uncouth countries such as yours that made us reach for the heights of cultural sophistication . 
  imo , we drink a lot of wine because we make the best . 
  and we make the best because we drink a lot of it . 
  drinking wine at meal , not beer at the table unless it 's relaxed with friends/family and otherwise everything outside of parties is `` ap\u00e9ro '' ( before dinner - around 7/7 :30 pm - where people eat snacks while sharing a stronger alcohol or beer ) . 
  when being invited to dinner , it is polite to bring wine/flower/dessert . 
  other than that , we pride themselves with our wine tradition ( 14 % of world production ) and make the best of it ( 12 % of world consumption ) and because of that , people often care more about quality than quantity . 
  ^ of ^ course , ^ that ^ does n't ^ mean ^ we ^ ca n't ^ get ^ shitfaced ^ with ^ cheap ^ vodka . 
  well it 's also because of the animation difference , japan ( ese animation ) express emotions by the eyes while western ( animation ) do that by the mouth . 
  nah , i think that every usa ad his dubbed , the exception being nespresso . 
  i love it !, 
  * southwest and yeah , it is basically dead , it is more an accent today then anything else . 
  * ... you know ... he was right ... 
  i 'm disgusted of his winnings in this category ... *, 
  can someone please tell me what `` normaund '' is supposed to look like ? 
  because i can tell you that it is not the name of the regional language nor the name of slang , it may be a error in the name of an inhabitant of normandy , but nothing else . 
  please , be serious . 
  there is no need to scare people of french politics . 
  as a french , i must say : `` scum !, 
  our countries will never be alike in any way !, 
  any true french knows better than to trust the perfid albion without a common ennemy ! '', 
  hummm ... we wo n't be able to see eye to eye , i 'm afraid ... 
  really ? 
  what appeals to you in it ? 
  ... dumb as usual , i see . 
  people do n't really speak about algeria since their independence war , the others we do n't care except for football . 
  who ? 
  latvia , got ta love that design ( and that haircut ) . 
  italy , for the 2 $ one . 
  france , for both design and patriotism . 
  also , is n't the luxemburg one especially hideous ? 
  french , 21yo nothing in history , in geography the date of entrance in the eu ( 01/01/2007 if i remember well ) . 
  other than that , all i know comes from paradox games ( polish-lithuanian commonwealth/republic of the two nation ) ( ck2/eu4 ) . 
  yeah , true , i forgot . 
  sorry for the late answer . 
  maybe it happened only three times , but there were only 7 president in the current republic . 
  no , the pm must be from the ruling party in parliament . 
  in 2012 he wanted to do a space defence against comets and aliens . 
  translation : a green mouse running through grass i catch it by the tail , i show it to theses sirs theses sirs tells me : dip it in oil , dip it in water , it 'll make a snail all hot . 
  in france it was believed till the 70s-80s that france only submitted to hitler because of government leaders in vichy as de gaulle said `` toute la france \u00e0 r\u00e9sister '' ( all france resisted '' ) in is speech at the paris liberation in order to raise morale and silence unrest . 
  in truth , they were around 3 % r\u00e9sistants and 3 % collaborators , all the rest waiting for the storm to pass ( the communist party joined the resistance after the nazis attacking the ussr so and they were far more resistant in 1944 than in 1940 ) . 
  at the time p\u00e9tain was the head of the country , seen as a ww1 hero . 
  so basically a lot of people turned a blind full eye at it but now the crimes of the vichy regime are well recognized and every few years there 's a movie about it ( just seen the trailer for `` un sac de billes '' actually ) . 
  of course , there is sadly still some fascists at large , with every few years someone being condemned for '' [ n\u00e9gationnisme ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_negationism ) '' such as `` the gas chambers are a detail of history '' . 
  well it 's a bit different because you 're not a french , so you do n't have a true interest in french politics so people are much more likely to dismiss anything you say as `` silliness of a foreigner who know nothing '' and thus not get angry . 
  it 's a saying so it 's not to be taken as word of god , but we say that because when you have people over that you do n't know well or that have differing views , there is too much of a risk that it ruins the night ( especially if wine is included ) . 
  for example , a few years ago , friends of my parents ( 2 couples ) were invited to dinner between the 2 turns of the presidential election . 
  long story short , they had a huge fight and refuse to be in each others presence . 
  however , if you are around like-minded people or calm people ( and sober !, 
  ) , you 're fine . 
  in paris : - the aligre market . 
  - take a v\u00e9lib card , it 'll be way easier to go around . 
  outside of paris : - [ s\u00e8te ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%a8te ) ( and eat the local specialty - the [ tielle ] ( http://images.midilibre.fr/images/2013/02/10/pour-proteger-la-tielle-peu-de-possibilites-si-ce-n-est_522389_510x255.jpg ) ) - [ carcassone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carcassonne ) - [ st malo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint-malo ) & mont st michel ( eat fish , cheese and apple products here ) - [ veules-les-roses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veules-les-roses ) . 
  if you like to eat a lot and tire of french food , it is often less expensive in japanese restaurant to take the `` all you can eat '' ( `` a volont\u00e9 '' ) rather than the regular menu . 
  unless in a tourist trap , being outside of paris makes everything cheaper . 
  when searching for food , look out for the [ aop ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/appellation_d'origine_prot%c3%a9g%c3%a9e#/media/file:logo_aop_2008_pos.jpg ) label . 
  it means that it is the real product not some cheap alternative . 
  in france , they are two things you must avoid at a dinner : politics and religion . 
  other than that , unless you are part of a sect ( jehovah , scientology ... ) or have special requirements ( muslims and wine , jew and pork ... ) we do n't really care . 
  basically , unless it has the possibility to interfere with something , treat it like a dick : bad to show off in public , ok to show in private . 
  in france , legally , a political party is registered under the '' [ law ] ( http://www.cciag.com/about-us/association-loi-1901/ ) of [ 1901 ] ( http://cesc.online.fr/1901.html ) on [ associations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voluntary_association#france ) '' , making them the ( legal ) equivalent of any other association , whether they are the local sport club or [ a nationwide charity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/restaurants_du_c%c5%93ur ) . 
  so to found a party ( or anything else ) you need to only be 3 : a president , a secretary and a treasurer ( must be at least 16 to be part of the executive , anyone of any age can enter one ) . 
  as an association , your main way of funding would be membership and the sale of goodies ( you fix the price of the membership - the `` goodies '' are things like shirts with the name of the association , plates with the logo ... ) . 
  if you are recognized as `` association of public utility '' ( need at least 200 members and a healthy `` business model '' ) ( charities , cultural , politics , scientific , health , environment , education , international solidarity ... ) it allows you to accept donations ( up to 7500 $ per person and year ) and inheritances . 
  besides that , any donations is reimbursed at 60 % by the state and as a political party , they are partially funded by the state . 
  donations must be made by physical persons to avoid corruption . 
  elections are made under the control of a judge and the [ constitutional concil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_council_%28france%29 ) to avoid cheating . 
  if a political party has at least 5 % at an election , the state reimbursable it ( a campaign have a max spending of ~ 17millions $ for the first turn , ~ 23millions $ for the second ) . 
  if they lie , they are ( theoretically ) passing in front of the judge but due to them being [ ~ ~ manipulative bastards ~ ~ politicians of career ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolas_sarkozy#controversies ) , they generally manage to escape . 
  ** edit : ** in an election ( no matter the size ) , if a contestant is named by the media , all his opponents must be named to . 
  the tv also must give equal speech time to all contestants ( down to the second iirc ) . 
  [ this new article about a drastic change in eu laws . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ), 
  it 's not really about nationalities anymore , it 's more about politics . 
  for example , a french separatist and an english separatist can hate each other but as soon as a european federalist walk in , they are best of friends and team up to beat him up . 
   but we all know our best player went to the final with problems and the other players were worried about if that 's what you tell yourself to sleep at night . 
  besides , we all know that the 98 team was the best and only the italian treachery stopped us from winning in 08 . . 
  and about the `` women are trans male '' ... let 's just say that it has the same kind of reputation has bangkok . 
  mcdonalds : macdo or domac most are just what we call verlan ( or `` versre '' for `` reverse '' ) . 
  when it 's a kebab , pasta or sushi , we just say that we `` do a greek/turk/italian / jap ( anese ) / whatever what we are eating come from '' . 
  nice people with a corrupt government , does n't care very much about the environment . 
  the stereotypical ( not mine ! ), 
  view of brazil is : you are either corrupt or poor , football is a religion ( 98 !, 
  o / ) and women are trans male ( running joke ) . 
  in france , i 'll say that unless you have someone interested in genealogy in your family , most people do n't care/know further than the 20th/late 19th century ( because of grand parents speaking of their past ) . 
  besides , i heard it 's hard in some cases to go back further than 1789 due to the revolution ( records were mostly done by the church and when the church burn ... ) . 
  french here . 
  the only communal showers i 've been in are in pools but the only persons i 've seen with sandals were old people fearing slipping . 
  to complete the other answer : they basically holds the money . 
  england is really london ( city of ) and the rest an arid desert where water is found more often than money . 
  imo , the general consensus in france is that they are assholes who wants everything and more because they are an island , so most of the people i know just want to kick them out to end favour treatment . 
  the ones that want them in is basically because they are the bridge between europe and the english speaking world , got a bit of a military and host the city . 
  nah , you should be fine !, 
  it 's actually one of the biggest grievances against schengen , how migrants force their ways into a country ( ex : ceuta ) , are given a residency pass because their home country do n't want them back and are free to go anywhere . 
  : of course , you should maybe call an embassy to be sure ( french or south african ) just in case but you should be fine . 
  raised bilingual , with french mum refusing to speak/answer me in english and kiwi dad doing the same with french , which was great for understanding the language and all but due to my lack of interest over formal education in english ( start at 11 in france ) i had an horrendous grammar and not a really good vocabulary . 
  it really was when i was 15/16 , that my father , who read an essay that i wrote for school , gave me a dressing down , saying i was `` wasting my advantages '' and these kinds of things ( which were entirely true ) , which made me listen in class , stop read the subtitles in theatres and read books in english ( instead if just translations ) . 
  i also began to read fanfiction when i was 17/18 which made me realise how much proper speech was important ( i knew it before , but only theoretically , if i can say so ) and gave me motivation . 
  tl ; dr : raised bilingual french/english in france , was n't good in grammar till i studied it `` hard '' . 
  depends on your disabillity , but since you 're on reddit , i guess that you can work at least semi-normally so i do n't think you 'll have any problem . 
  i 'm not sure about that , but i think it 's illegal ( in france at least ) to fire you because of a disability if it 's not interfering with your work ( ex : a spokesperson who `` becomes '' mute .
