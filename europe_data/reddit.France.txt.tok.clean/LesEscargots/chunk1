   but what movement is being referenced here ? 
  the political correctness `` movement '' . 
  the black lives matter `` movement '' . 
  essentially , as much as it 's an oxymoron , the * regressive * part of the progressive movement . 
  --  this is just glamorized malice and self-righteous egotism . 
  of course it is . 
  because the political correctness `` movement '' is all about being holier-than-thou . 
  as much as this phrase is overused , it is an oppression olympics . 
  it 's about proving racism where it does n't exist . 
  it 's about applying a standard to others , which you do n't reflect back on yourself . 
  it 's about having a black lives matter riot to protest the self-inflicted death of a black guy . 
   * the independent police complaints commission has launched an investigation into charles 's death . 
  the met said charles was seen `` trying to swallow an object '' and that an officer `` sought to prevent the man from harming himself '' . 
  *  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/28/demonstrators-dalston-london-protest-death-rashan-charles --  i ca n't see how the creation of this video was justified , not least by the gallery itself . 
  of course it is n't , particularly , given that the [ scottish national portrait gallery is taxpayer funded and government managed . 
  ] ( https://www.nationalgalleries.org/about-us/who-we-are ) but think about the sort of people who study the arts , it 's nearly all left wing people . 
  it 's unsurprising that they 'd abuse their position to inject their ideology into the public sphere . 
  https://twitter.com/ap/status/872124426233548801  breaking : french interior minister says notre dame attacker cried ` it 's for syria '  @ap - associated press, 
   is clearly fallacious . 
  there was a period of over a century in which ireland was represented in parliament , which obviously refutes the claim that ireland had no representation in any parliament . 
  representation by the descendants of [ protestant ( i.e anglican ) land-owning settlers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_ascendancy ) , who had colonized ( ireland during in [ the plantations . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantations_of_ireland ) you can call that representation , i 'd call that foreign rule by proxy . 
  in the 122 years when we were part of the united kingdom proper , we spent 29 years when catholics could n't even become a mp , and 86 years where other limits placed on irish people becoming mps . 
  also , as for being `` representative '' of ireland 's wishes : * [ first home rule bill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_home_rule_bill ) : 1886 ( defeated in house of commons ) * [ second home rule bill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_home_rule_bill ) : 1893 ( defeated in house of lords ) * [ third home rule bill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_home_rule_bill ) : 1914 ( defeated 3 times in lords , only passed after government overrode the hol , never actually implemented ) if the house of commons was * so * representative of ireland , why did it not support ireland 's wishes ? 
  british rule in ireland was self-serving , and never in the interests of irish people . 
  end of . 
  we had no representation in the government which ruled us for the best part of 800 years , whether or not we were given token representation for 50 does n't matter . 
  the point still stands . 
  but i also wo n't acquiesce to false claims about it . 
  just because it was clearly morally bad does not mean that it 's also ok to make up claims about moral wrongs that are n't true . 
  or , you know , actual history . 
  why is it that : * the head of [ famine relief ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( ireland \\ ) ) in ireland , [ sir charles trevelyan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sir_charles_trevelyan,_1st_baronet ) , had this opinion of us :  `` the judgement of god sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated . 
  ... the real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the famine , but the moral evil of the selfish , perverse and turbulent character of the people . '', 
  * [ lord salisbury ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_gascoyne-cecil,_3rd_marquess_of_salisbury ) , prime minister and secretary of state for foreign affairs , had this to say on irish home rule :  `` you would not confide free representative institutions to the hottentots [ savages ] , for instance . '', 
  it 's not just immoral , it 's bordering on willful negligence . 
  so , [ 1171 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lordship_of_ireland#transformation_into_a_kingdom ) to [ 1800 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1800 ) , did n't happen ? 
  you can be pedantic and say that was n't when ireland was part of `` the united kingdom '' , but we were [ ruled from london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_ireland ) , laws were passed by a parliament of [ protestant landowner settlers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_ascendancy ) , and irish people/catholics were systematically discriminated against , by laws put in place by that ruling class . 
  and then , even after we became a full part of the united kingdom , the penal laws were only fully repealed 69 years later , its fair to say that most of the ill treatment happened before the act of union , but its lying to say that irish people magically were treated the same , by virtue of the act of union . 
  and then , lets not even start on northern ireland : * [ a protestant parliament for a protestant people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_protestant_parliament_for_a_protestant_people ) , gerrymandering of northern irish electoral districts to maintain unionist majority , even though 4 of the 6 counties have a nationalist majority . 
  * [ royal ulster constabulary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_ulster_constabulary ) , a quasi-paramilitary police force , with literally no catholic representation , which [ held lighters to kids testicles ] ( https://www.journeyman.tv/film_documents/4952/transcript/ ) , [ attacked kids ] ( https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/uk927.pdf ) and [ colluded with loyalist terrorist organisations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_ulster_constabulary#loyalist_collusion ) * housing allocation : in order to do the gerrymandering , housing allocation was done along sectarian lines , which not only furthered sectarian divisions , but also allowed people to be disenfranchised as only the owner and their spouse in a house , was given the right to vote . 
  still want to defend british rule in ireland ? 
  i respect the northern irish peoples right to self-determination , which currently supports remaining within the united kingdom , but do n't tell me that british rule in ireland was somehow good , it has only resulted in violence and division . 
  once we finally got proper representation , we swiftly used it to leave the united kingdom , if that 's proof of anything , its proof that british rule in ireland was not wanted . 
  edit : and to be clear , i 'm irish . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penal_laws_ ( ireland ) * exclusion of catholics ( from 1607 ) and presbyterians ( from 1707 ) from most public offices . 
  * catholics and protestants banned from intermarriage , without converting to protestantism . 
  * catholics barred from holding firearms or serving in the armed forces . 
  * bar from membership in parliament ( from 1652 to 1662 , 1691 to 1829 ) . 
  * catholics did not have the right to vote [ ( disenfranchising act 1728 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disenfranchising_act ) , until 1793 ) . 
  * exclusion from the legal professions and the judiciary ; repealed ( respectively ) 1793 and 1829 . 
  * education act 1695 -- ban on foreign education ; repealed 1782 . 
  * bar to catholics and presbyterians entering trinity college dublin ; repealed 1793 . 
  * on the death of a catholic , their family could only inherit by conversion to the church of ireland . 
  so , yeah . 
  stop talking out of your ass . 
  yeah , it 's probably qualified doctors , rather than doctors working for the health service . 
  http://www.rcsismj.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/chalikondal-emigration.pdf we have a massive oversupply of qualified doctors , but not enough money to hire them all , so they emigrate , primarily to the other anglosphere countries . 
  edit : relevant part . 
   ireland currently has the highest number of doctors working abroad , with 47.5 % of our doctors outside the country . 
   wait a minute ... there are no eu countries that give citizenship through birth , right ? 
  right ??? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli there are , but with restrictions : country | restrictions : -- | : -- ireland | born on the island ( incl . 
  northern ireland ) , to a least one british or irish citizen parents . 
  uk | if by age ten , at least one of your parents is a british citizen . 
  france | if one of your foreign citizen parent , was also born in france . 
  greece | if you are not automatically eligible for foreign citizenship at birth . 
  spain | if born to someone legally domiciled in spain at the time of their birth . 
  germany | if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit ( and had this status for at least three years ) and the parent was residing in germany for at least eight years . 
  edit : ireland was the last european country to have [ unrestricted jus soli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-seventh_amendment_of_the_constitution_of_ireland ) ( 2004 ) . 
  yeah , if you have that system , the following referenda would not have passed : ( despite them having large majority support ) year | referendum | yea | nay | turnout : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- 2015 | [ irish same-sex marriage referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_constitutional_referendums,_2015 ) | 62 % | 38 % | 61 % 1971 | [ swiss women 's suffrage ( at federal level ) referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_referendums,_1971 ) | 66 % | 34 % | 58 % 1997 | [ scottish devolution referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_devolution_referendum,_1997 ) | 74 % | 26 % | 60 % 1975 | [ british european community membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 ) | 67 % | 33 % | 65 % 1994 | [ finnish european union membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_european_union_membership_referendum,_1994 ) | 57 % | 43 % | 70 % 2003 | [ czech european union membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_european_union_membership_referendum,_2003 ) | 77 % | 23 % | 55 % 2003 | [ estonian european union membership referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_european_union_membership_referendum,_2003 ) | 67 % | 33 % | 64 % i mean , i love the irony of the previous eu membership referenda . 
  so , the uk leaving the eu is so important to the uk that it should require a supermajority , but the finnish , czech and estonian referenda on joining the eu are n't important to those countries at all ? 
  the only referenda i can think of with more than ~ 75 % turnout and 60 % in one direction are : year | referendum | yea | nay | turnout : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- 2013 | [ falkland islands sovereignty referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ) | 99.8 % | 0.2 % | 91.94 % 2002 | [ gibraltar shared sovereignty referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_2002 ) | 1.03 % | 98.97 % | 87.9 % 1938 | [ austria 's anschluss `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_anschluss_referendum,_1938 ) | 99.73 % | 0.27 % | 99.71 % 2014 | [ russia 's crimea annexation `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) | 96.77 % | 2.51 % | 83.1 % 2014 | [ donetsk 's self-rule `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donbass_status_referendums,_2014#referendum_in_donetsk_oblast ) | 89.07 % | 10.19 % | 74.87 % 2014 | [ luhansk 's independence `` referendum '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donbass_status_referendums,_2014#referendum_in_luhansk_oblast ) | 96.2 % | 3.8 % | 75 % like , the bar he is setting for referenda means they have to be either : * not even necessary , due to the clear support in one direction ( gib and fi ) * a sham , with the [ obvious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7enmfoy.jpg ) voter [ intimidation ] ( http://totallyhisto.ry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/anschluss-ballot.jpg ) , and done under military occupation . 
  just because a person disagrees with the result , does not give them the right to demand the system should be different , if it had been the other way round , they 'd be saying that it had `` settled the issue '' and that there is `` no need for another one '' . 
   first paragraph . 
  we 'll have to refer to the opposing viewpoint as something , why do n't we just accept them naming their movement as whatever they like , and have a substantive debate about the issue , rather than giving them free ammunition to say `` these people are immature . '', 
  this referendum wo n't be won like the same-sex marriage referendum was , that was a shitfest where half the debate was arguing about how to debate properly . 
  without a proper , substantive debate on the issue , people will vote no by habit , rather than take the risk . 
   second paragraph . 
  exactly , that 's basically what the oireachtas is going to decide before the referendum is put to the people , whilst constitutional convention was a neat political vehicle to advance the abortion referendum without having fine gael and fianna fail implode due to tds breaking the whip , we 'll now see how far the government is willing to push it . 
  preferably , you 'd want it up until the baby is viable , but if they push it too far , the debate will turn into `` but a baby at x weeks can survive '' , and people will vote the referendum down because they can not support the ending of a viable babies life . 
  with the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities , it 'll throw a spanner in the works , because whilst we do n't want to force women to carry babies that are going to die , if the cut-off point is too far along , you 'll have the same issue as above . 
  the problem with roe vs. wade is that the arguments were being made to a court of rights , rather than a court of public opinion , whilst a judge could accept that abortion should be legal until one second before the woman goes into labour , on the basis of their rights , the vast majority of people would never accept the intentional ending of the life of a fully formed baby , at such a late stage . 
   third paragraph . 
  probably , my only concern is that if we lose this referendum due to stupidity and immaturity shown by `` pro choice '' campaigners , the movement towards having another one will be dead in the water , and there wo n't be another one for a long time . 
  particularly , if there is a brexit/trump election-type twitter meltdown by pro-choice people . 
  although , i honestly do n't understand the `` look at the countries we are on the list with argument '' , it can be completely turned on its head , particularly when we have [ ** the fourth lowest maternal death rate ** ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/12/maternal-mortality-rates-millennium-development-goals ) in the world . 
  there are some lists where ireland ranks highly , and some where we do n't , its the same for every country , and so its not a great argument when you consider most of europe does n't allow [ ** gay marriage ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_same-sex_marriage ) . 
  added this in , basically what i 'm saying is , would it be fair to say poland is literally saudi arabia because it does n't allow gay marriage , ignoring the fact that the situation for lesbians and gays in both countries are completely different . 
  to make this relative to abortion , whilst we are on the same list as sharia-law dictatorships when it comes to abortion , its disingenuous to say that healthcare for pregnant women in ireland and say , iran , are somehow comparable . 
  for example , [ ** malta ** ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38235264 ) , our english speaking friends in the eu , ban abortion completely , with no exceptions , which is harsher than in most muslim countries . 
   you 're not debating here . 
   you 're just taking what i 'm writing and adding your own context to it . 
  i and i presume you are both firmly in the pro-choice camp . 
  we were n't debating . 
  my point is that outside of the `` college bubble '' , the vast majority of irish people will not take kindly to the arguments you are putting forward , it 'll just be seen as immature and avoiding debating substantive topics about the issue . 
   it does n't read well and you 're coming across very aggressive . 
  i apologize if i seem aggressive . 
  i 'm just sick of hearing `` pro choice '' supporters solely view the issue through their own world view lense , and not accepting that their viewpoints will not translate well into talking points when trying to convince undecided voters , who will be vital to winning the referendum . 
   debate me on the issue and properly address my points or do n't debate me at all .
