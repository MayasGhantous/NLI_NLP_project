of course not - france is famous for it 's food and old stone monuments , whereas mexico is a second-rate country that wishes it was first-rate , and is the butt of americans ' jokes . 
  obviously the two countries have nothing in common . 
   i 'm a lot more afraid of some neo nazis than of muslims . 
  i 'm more afraid of people texting while driving , or of restaurant owners & grocers skipping hygiene precautions , than of either of those . 
  til i 'm having an identity crisis . 
  so nz has to keep him until he comes up with $ 4000 ? 
  i 'm fine with that !, 
  by that logic , why distinguish all the slavic people ? 
  they also came from the same population originally . 
  or why distinguish germans , swedes , danes , austrians and icelanders ? 
  they all come from the same proto-germanic population somewhere in scandinavia . 
  or why distinguish americans , englishmen and australians ? 
  that fact is that * now * , the groups in france are fairly distinct , so using different names makes sense . 
  the two words are not synonyms . 
  like a lot of words ( especially when we 're dealing with translations ) , different people use different definitions and those definitions are all fuzzy . 
  go tell a spanish * gitano * that he 's a roma `` by definition '' . 
  heh , there seems to be ( at least ) two distinct groups , but no very good terms for distinguishing them . 
  to make things worse , i 'm sure you 'll be glad to hear that in france we often call them `` romanian '' ( i wonder which proportion of the population thinks `` rom '' is an abbreviation of `` romanian '' ? ), 
  ( after looking things up ) , hmm , actually `` tsigane '' may actually be a french term for the roms from the east , unlike what i 've said in the posts above , and * gitans * and `` manouche '' would be the local / spanish ones . 
  agreed some of that is bullshit , i mostly wanted to highlight the perceived gap between the gitano and the roma . 
  like a lot of terms it has irregular usage , but as far as i know , those in france we call * tsiganes * , * gitans * or * manouche * are usually considered `` non-roma '' , even though they have the same ancestors centuries ago . 
  the `` roma '' ( or `` rom '' or `` rroma '' or `` romanichels '' ) are more recently arrived ( in france at least ) from the east . 
  ( edit ) actually , maybe `` tsigane '' also designates the rroma from the east . 
  we have non-roma gypsies in france but they 're mostly fine ( as far as i can tell , i know a few ) . 
  see also [ this old thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6luag ) :  here in spain , there are gitanos , who are spanish gypsies . 
  the gitanos probably predate the spanish on the iberian peninsula , but the spanish , who are generally ridiculously racist , hate the gitanos ( except for the flamenco ) . 
  they call them thieves and lazy freeloaders and all the rest . 
  but get this , the spanish gitanos fucking despise the the roma gypsies . 
  they refuse to have anything to do with them and regard the roma as basically the scum of the earth . 
  i think that 's pretty telling . 
  i do . 
  i would rather they did n't live anywhere near me , but i also wish they lead happy and fulfilling lives , with as little conflict with the rest of society as possible . 
  california may be kinder to them than europe - after all , it * is * a place where weirdos thrive . 
  also good for the roma themselves . 
  is there a place we can chip in to help pay for the trip ? 
  as far as i know it 's mostly about the doctrine of [ non-refoulement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-refoulement ) , which forbids sending people back to a war zone , or a country where they 'll be persecuted . 
  there 's also the idea that to drop people in a country , you better have that country 's authorization . 
  sure , i can understand people being unhappy about that , just like sarkozy 's electors would have been unhappy if he had legalized gay marriage . 
  i 'm in favour of politicians taking wise-but-unpopular decisions , though of course many will disagree over which decisions are really wise . 
   people hate on the left because they are too liberal ( they seriously pushed reforms the right never thought were possible in france ... then opposed them because they can never agree with their opponents ) and most right-wing candidates are promising us a liberal hell . 
  as someone who 's pretty pro-free-market , i 'm not complaining about this development . 
  ( and gadaffi ), 
  thanks for the account , it does help get a better picture of what 's going on !, 
  i ca n't find the source right now , but i saw a survey on tv comparing the popularity of the various candidates for the french public in general ( and * not * only people who usually vote to the right ) , and basically it was something like jupp\u00e9 around 60 % , nkm/fillon/copp \u00e9 / le maire around 50-55 % , and sarkozy in the 30s or 40s ( i 'm going off memory , the details are probably wrong , and maybe fillon too ) . 
  i agree that surveys of people who will actually vote in the primaries give him a higher expected score ( but still below jupp\u00e9 ) . 
  i suspect a moist sandwich would win against le pen in the final round of the presidential election . 
  no need for `` the establishment '' - most people just do n't like the fn , with good reason . 
   forcing far left policies down peoples throats all over the world has forced people to go to the far right . 
  a fair amount of people complain ( in france at least ) that the eu has been about forcing right-wing ( more specificially , pro-free-market ) policies down peoples ' throat against their will . 
  sarkozy deserves a big chunk of the blame too ( which probably contributes to why he does n't have much of a chance in the coming election - he 's the least favourite candidate in the * r\u00e9publicains * primaries . 
  yeah , it 's very common . 
  you do n't have that in the states ? 
  ( assuming you 're american ), 
  i think that if there are places to avoid , it * is * a good thing to warn tourists about them , but this way of doing so is pretty bad . 
  they should have found a more politically correct way of doing so , for example : * specifically name the areas , or subway stations , or give a map * give a few indicators of a `` crappy part of town '' ( bars on windows ? 
  broken windows ? 
  a lot of littering ? 
  homeless people ? 
  nobody in the street ? 
  liquor stores ? ), 
  ... but i do n't know london nearly well enough to say what those signs would be . 
  i could say which parts of paris or nearby one should avoid though , and what kind of people one should be careful about . 
  the advice i 'd give in person would be pretty different from the kind of advice acceptable in an official publication . 
  [ you can talk ] ( http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html ) . 
  i do n't mind either , but / u/samuel79s above seems to have had a different experience ... of course it 's hard for me to tell how other french react to foreigners , but i do n't think that reputation is * entirely * undeserved . 
  well , [ part 2 ] ( http://www.itchyfeetcomic.com/2016/03/speaking-terms-part-2.html ) is the same idea with asian countries . 
  last polls on the republican primaries showed jupp\u00e9 had a significant lead there . 
  and i know people who voted for sarkozy in the past ( as i did ) , but are planning to participate in the republican primaries * just * to push for jupp\u00e9 instead of sarkozy ( i 'm planning on participating and vote for jupp\u00e9 , but not particularly out of hatred for sarkozy , jupp\u00e9 just happens to seem more qualified ) . 
  this latest national poll seems to show that whoever wins the republican primaries , wins the election ( but let 's not write off a big surprise - another terrorist attacks , jupp\u00e9 dies , a jupp\u00e9-le pen sex tape , macron 's popularity blows up , etc. 
  paywalled :( i found it on an archive , are archive links allowed ? 
  ( i think last time i posted one it was removed ), 
  stop at the first place there are police nearby and call 'em over , something like that . 
  thanks , that makes sense . 
  i expect someone will end up finding a technical solution , like an alarm that goes bwaaap bwaap if the cable is cut or something . 
  is it * that * hard to properly lock a truck ? 
  ( i 'm not a trucker , i do n't know , but surely the threat of a 2000-pound fine would be an incentive to find * some * way to securely lock your truck ... ), 
  she most likely wo n't be elected , tho i do n't know if this would increase or decrease her score . 
  it 's not as if she can point to nigel farage as an example to follow . 
  [ il est des notres ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vszfiyk5ei ) is probably the most common . 
  ( edit ) also [ la danse du limousin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffmla9phe-e ) ( more of a drunk song than a drinking song tho ), 
  true . 
  * that * was actual satire . 
  seconded - i 'm in paris and was still making tasteless jokes after the charlie and bataclan attacks . 
  i just find laughing at disaster a better response than freaking out or getting all gloomy . 
  what happened happened , it 's not like we can do anything about it now . 
  so , to each his own coping mechanism . 
  the problem is people giving publicity to what they find outrageous and offensive . 
  if a joke makes you sad and angry , why do you have to go repeat it to a hundred people who will also get sad and angry ?? 
  that 's how you make everybody hate each other . 
  by comparison to this one , the first one is actually pretty good . 
  while they 're certainly very * different * , how often have you read an actual paper * charlie hebdo * ? 
  here you 're just being exposed to an extreme in terms of tasteless offensiveness , but it 's not representative as a whole . 
  if you showed the most tasteless unfunny edgy clip from south park to a regular charlie hebdo reader , he 'd conclude that charlie hebdo is just better quality . 
  i 'd say that in terms of finding new and creative ways to be offensive and still kinda funny , they 're equal , in terms of humour , south park is funnier , and in terms of intelligent commentary on contemporary issues , charlie hebdo is better . 
  `` cool , it keeps my tits from sagging ! '', 
  they realized they could make a living doing this , and have been doing so for decades . 
  i ca n't blame them for doing so , it sure beats working in an advertising firm . 
  eh , look at the various offensive charlie pics linked in this thread , many do n't have redeeming `` truths '' ... does [ this one ] ( http://blogs.lainformacion.com/zoomboomcrash/files/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-eta1.jpg ) have a `` point of truth '' to deliver ? 
   vuillemin eh , he 's pretty much the incarnation of crass and offensive and not-very-funny stuff . 
   charlie hebdo did a whole paper with jokes on surfers , and they received loads of angry letters in cavanna 's autobiography he talks about the hara-kiri days , about how they 'd always be getting mail from people who found the magazine hilarious , except that one time where they made fun of whichever group/profession the sender belonged to .
