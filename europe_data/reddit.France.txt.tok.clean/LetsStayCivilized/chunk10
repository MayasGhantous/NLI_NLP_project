  you can easily find sauce ( though in jars more than cans ) . 
   common alcoholic beverages http://www.itchyfeetcomic.com/2011/02/le-grand-seleccion.html, 
  yeah , i tend to be , though of course not in favour of * all * possible forms a federal europe could take . 
  i do n't think we 'll be talking about mullywood anytime soon . 
  same here in france . 
  using deciliters does sound a bit weird ( i 'm not sure in which context one would use them ) , but if i see dcl in the context of volume , i 'll guess that that 's what it 's talking about . 
  dkg , on the other hand - i would n't even guess that it 's a unit . 
  yup , in english and french we call k\u00f6ln `` cologne '' . 
  i find that [ this map of regions ( based on cia factbook ) ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:regions_of_europe_based_on_cia_world_factbook.png ) makes sense . 
  hm , i think i 'd count belgium as western europe , and denmark as nothern europe . 
  i would count the czechs as central . 
  someone should photoshop those together on a travel guide cover . 
  what more than `` reise f\u00fchrer '' and `` die usa '' could be on there ? 
  fortunately , in french * `` bite '' * alone is not an insult like `` dick '' is in english . 
  ( you can say * t\u00eate de bite '' * or * `` p ` tite bite '' * though ), 
   the latin one is much more prefered . 
  over 90 % of the people use latin more . 
  but then  people on the internet also most exclusively use cyrilic in general . 
  ... you meant latin here , right ? 
  either : * you 're in a country that touches the atlantic , in which case you 're in western europe * or you 're in a country that does n't touch the atlantic , in which case you 're in central europe , and eastern europe is other countries further eastwards . 
  ( ok , not a perfect rule , italy and scandinavia do n't qualify as central europe ), 
  we actually have [ at least three pretenders to the throne ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_pr%c3%a9tendants_au_tr%c3%b4ne_de_france_depuis_1792 ) . 
  so the royal family tree could still take some pruning . 
  you 've already been warned that austrians and hungarians do n't like being called `` eastern european '' , but i 'd like to add that czechs do n't like being called `` eastern european '' ( from what i 've heard over there ) . 
  if i read spanish or italian , i can understood most of it tho may be missing a few crucial words ( i 've read forum threads or articles in those language and understood enough ) . 
  but i ca n't understand any of those languages when they 're spoken . 
  i 'd say `` germanic europe '' and `` latin europe '' are pretty different from each other * and * from america . 
  but overall , on average i feel americans have a ( slightly ) more * effective * work ethic than french people , in terms of actually getting stuff done . 
  and on average , better work-life balance for the french . 
  could i have some ketchup with [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/irvfj ) ? 
  in france too . 
  * especially * if it annoys them . 
  or worse , a boomerang in austria . 
  but if a romanian sells a made-in-china sombrero to a japanese tourist in spain , who is appropriating whose culture ? 
   i do n't just mean by being loud and violent , but also rude , offensive and just generally unpleasant . 
  ah , thanks for adding that , otherwise i was afraid the french would n't qualify . 
  nah , you should be fine . 
  there are some sketchy places in/around paris ( and probably the other places you visit ) , but a ) they 're still not * very * sketchy , you might get catcalled by a dickhead ? , and b ) i do n't see how a normal tourist would end up there ( maybe if you booked a cheap hotel/airbnb in the suburbs ? ), 
  1 ) dumping people in tunisia would be a breach of their sovereignty and a very bad diplomatic move , unless you get some kind of agreement with them . 
  2 ) dumping people in a war zone like libya would qualify as [ refoulement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-refoulement ) and so would be a breach of international law ( in addition to being bad diplomacy etc. ), 
  i agree that european leadership has been far from impressive on this topic , but i do n't know where to pin the blame - is it the way european institutions are set up ? 
  is it because of disagreement about values ? 
  ( like , merkel valuing charity more than national interest ) is it sheer incompetence ? 
  is it infighting ? 
  is it because of the strong constraints from existing european and international laws ? 
  those * are * the kind of thing that a good politician is supposed to navigate . 
  i do n't know how to do that , but it would be fun if for each national election , all other heads of state would evaluate , on a scale of 1 to 10 , how much they would want to work with each candidate . 
  and it would be up to electors to see what they want to do with that information . 
  ( it could backfire , and poison international relations even before the guy is elected if he had a bad score , so maybe not a * great * idea . ), 
  not really no . 
  ideally whoever processes applications should know how to ask for and record correctly a wide range of kinds of names , so that people are identified as unambiguously as possible . 
  that is [ more tricky than just first name - last name ] ( https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/ ) , but should still be doable . 
  sorry v4 , but op gave me absolute power , including of enacting laws in your countries . 
  though if i had to * realistically * try to get v4 on board with this , i would emphasize : * clarifying the difference between migrants ( anyone who shows up ) , asylum seekers ( someone who made an official demand for refugee status ) and refugee ( someone whose demand has been accepted - and there are usually pretty strict conditions for this ) should lighten the concerns about economic migrants hidden among the refugees ( i do n't know how big that concern is for v4 , though honestly i do n't think solving it would make v4 * much * more receptive ) * asking that all member countries contribute proportionally to their economic weight , but the contribution should include both border control ( boats , fences , nauru-style centres where people wait for their demand to be processed ) and welcoming refugees , but not necessarily in equal proportion ( so if the czech do n't want refugees on their land , that means they 'll have to provide more money or material or manpower instead ), 
  yeah , but china also is n't very big on foreigners , especially poor ones . 
  ( a lot of this probably exists / is being done , i have n't investigated in depth ) so : * i 'd hire a bunch of experts on international law , especially maritime law , refugees rights etc. 
  because there are a lot of tricky points there ( unless the eu has enough of those experts , which is probably the case ) * i 'd set up well-organized and safe camps offshore , ideally outside the eu ( this needs an agreement with those countries , like austrialia has with papua new guinea and nauru ) , to which intercepted boats can be brought * i 'd make a centralized database of all information about refugees ( was seen at this border , applied for asylum at this place , said he was from this country , etc. ), 
  * i 'd ask all member states to provide ( from their army/navy/etc . ), 
  ships or men to serve either in a european border patrol ( land & sea ) or to man the camps . 
  the goal is not only to ensure that those are well run , but also to show that europe is working together . 
  * i would define a european asylum process , whose criteria should be compatible with international law * and * voted upon by member states ( they need to buy in this , if it 's imposed to everybody the eu will explode ) . 
  criteria should depend on a list of which refugees from which country are * really * persecuted ( to be updated depending on what 's happening in the world ) , and also how people may disqualify themselves from this process , or be treated in lower priority . 
  aspects that may penalize candidates : having lied about their nationality , having tried to force entry , getting angry at the bureaucrats handling their case , of course crime , etc. 
  * refugees who are granted asylum should be split among the countries depending of their capacity to host them * economic migrants ( those * not * applying for asylum ) also go to those centres , and may apply for immigration to specific countries , in which case the rules etc. 
  depend of that country ( and * may * include language , religion , education , skills , etc. 
  as criteria ) * anybody showing up uninvited is brought to such a centre , and will likely be processed with a low priority . 
  * heavily crack down on people smugglers , maybe with preferential treatment for migrants who rat out their smugglers * heavy propaganda ( australia-style ) to potential migrants about what the rules are , and about what kind of behaviour wo n't be tolerated . 
  well , as a french man , i strongly approve of those teaching methods and wish that was taught to everybody studying french . 
  people from * les \u00eeles * i know seem well integrated , but then , so are the maghrebis i know . 
  the media exaggerates integration problems ( there * are * problems , they just are n't * that * common ) . 
  what do i know about slovenia ? 
  it 's mostly mountainous , used to be part of yugoslavia but was the first to jump ship , and unlike the others this was n't followed by bloodshed . 
  the western part used to be under italian rule but they got it back after ww2 . 
  i think it used to be in the habsburg austro-hungarian empire but i 'm not sure . 
  it was the most industrialized part of yugoslavia . 
  was n't it the first ex-communist country to join the eu ? 
  beyond that , i 'd have to rely on a mix of my stereotypes about central europe , southern europe and slavs . 
  so i 'd say probably a growing economy , low unemployment , good food & drinks , probably not as many islands and tourism as croatia , and nice welcoming people . 
  and the capital is * glances at other post * er , ljujumblalasomething . 
  i do n't think that they 're considered as `` as '' french as the mainland in many people 's minds , they 're legally french but socially , economically and ethnically pretty different . 
  the people from over will occasionally get retarded questions like `` do you have toilets over there ? '', 
  a couple years ago there were a lot of protests in * martinique * , and a poll showed that a majority of mainland french people would be in favour of giving martinique it 's independence ( which they do n't want ) . 
  no , i do n't particularly care for that idea , i would expect it to cause friction with nationalists , as if there is n't enough of that . 
  finding ways of changing the rules of voting to defeat politicians you do n't like is a bit against the purpose and spirit of democracy . 
  does monaco qualify ? 
  i do n't really * hate * them but they seem to be more of a tax haven than an actual nation . 
  we 've had muslim immigration for decades , and people already had opinions on those , going from `` they 're oppressed victims of colonialism '' to `` they 're normal people leave them alone '' to `` they 're lazy and violent welfare parasites that are here to take our jobs '' . 
  i think the same opinion mostly carried over to the new migrants ( most of which do n't want to go to france anyway ) , and i do n't think * that * many people actually changed their view . 
  i 'd say americans tend to have a pretty crappy understanding of europe , and will try to analyse things through the filter of us politics , especially us race relations , which comes out stupid whether it comes from the american left , or the american right . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with any of that , i agree that we have `` concentric circles of care and/or loyalty '' . 
  the only thing i was objecting to was your saying that education made us more likely to be * disloyal * to your country - it * might * be true , but i do n't see how you could read it in what i said unless you considered loyalties mutually exclusive ( e.g. 
  loving your country more means loving your family less ) . 
  as for your specific example , ukraine is n't in the eu , and when i talk of europe , i 'm mainly thinking of the eu . 
  so no , i do n't feel much of a need to defend the ukrainians , but if finland got attacked , that would be another story . 
  i do n't see loyalty to a country and loyalty to europe as necessarily mutually exclusive . 
  would you say that the more someone is loyal to the uk , the less loyal to england he is ? 
  yeah , play luxembourg !, 
  hide under the table and sneak up next to people , and then whisper to them * `` hey psst - you wan na hide some money ? 
  i also think spain would be particularly interesting for brexit : there 's the gibraltar issue , and catalonia influences how they react to the idea of scottish independance . 
  education only inasmuch as it 's correlated with higher education .
