  higher education because there are a lot of exchange programs , foreign students and teachers , collaborative research programs financed by the eu , etc. 
  yep , i 'm pretty much like you , but do n't think that sentiment is * that * widespread outside the most educated and those with family from other european countries . 
  what death and carnage ? 
  the death toll from terrorist attacks is still * way * below deaths by cars , smoking , or slipping in the bathroom ( as far as i know - do n't quote me on the bathroom-slipping numbers ) . 
  just look like this [ map of mortality rates ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/europe/thematic/countries-by-death-rate.html ) , we 'd need a * lot * more terrorists than the occasional nutcase with an axe before they make a dent on those numbers . 
  i met a few in france , but can confirm that the mexican restaurants are rare and not particularly good . 
   even if he wins there 's no chance of a million-scale deportation . 
  europe can help !, 
  the germans are experienced in mass deportations , and we french are * very good * at helping them !, 
  together , we can bring the mexicans to the country of their choice ( i 'd expect mexico , spain , france , portugal or italy ) , and we finally get * quality * mexican food !, 
  * and * a source of cheap labour that does n't wear scary swimsuits !, 
  [ dancing lasha tumbai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone ) . 
  i want my three minutes back . 
  i agree it 's pretty weird . 
  maybe we need more mexican immigrants - i certainly would n't mind ( provided they 're not into drugs & gangs ) . 
   tacky stuff in gardens [ unlike europe ] ( https://leblogdemonsieurecho.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/nains-de-jardin-decheterie.jpg ), 
  depends of the details a lot . 
  i can see cases where that would be bad , and cases where it would be good . 
  in principle , i 'm in favour of countries being able to enter binding deals , because it allows them to find mutually beneficial deals . 
  and yes , `` binding '' means `` you may get sued if you break the deal '' . 
  i do n't know enough about the specifics of ttp to know to what extent it 's * really * mutually beneficial . 
  but i also get the feeling that a lot of people are objecting to the idea of countries entering * any * binding deal , not just saying that this specific deal sucks . 
   i hope you are not in favor of tpp i have n't researched it nearly enough to have a very certain opinion of it , but as far as i can tell , there are more economists think it will make things better than economists who think it will make things work , so i 'm tentatively in favour of it . 
  i do n't really mind nationalism * per se * - i approve of the idea that a government 's primarily responsibility is the welfare of it 's own people , and that people being attached to their country is a healthy thing . 
  so i like flag-waving , civic rituals , etc. 
  what i do n't like , however , is * stupidity * , and sometimes nationalist parties have a fair share of that - for example promoting the idea that immigrants are `` bad for the economy '' or `` take people 's jobs '' , which as far as i can tell is just * incorrect * for most immigrants ( i 'm willing to concede it might be true for some very specific subgroups ) , or opposing trade deals that make everybody better off , or believing that one 's own culture is * actually * superior to all the others in some absolute sense , etc. 
  ( and of course i do n't like the whole `` let 's invade other countries to show our country best country '' , but * nobody * likes that any more except maybe those crazy russians ) also , i wish we could see more european-level nationalism , with people actually being proud of europe and the european identity . 
  it seems we have the choice between anti-european nationalist parties , or anti-nationalist parties . 
  outside of ww2 ( which offers * too much * choice ) , i 'd say louis xvi , for trying to sneak out of the country to ask foreign powers to invade france . 
  that pissed a * lot * of people off , and kickstarted the whole `` you know what ? 
  let 's just start chopping these people 's heads off '' thing . 
  `` huge raging asshole '' or `` walking disaster '' maybe , but i do n't see hitler as a * traitor * proper . 
  maybe * le mar\u00e9chal p\u00e9tain * ? 
  or pierre laval , or jacques doriot . 
  well , that 's just , like , your opinion man . 
  more seriously tho - i disagree !, 
  1 ) this is also a place for social interaction & fun , and i do n't see why exchanging uninformed opinion ( clearly marked as such ) is worse than exchanging reaction gif or nazi puns . 
  2 ) more importantly , i think often the average of a bunch of `` random opinion '' is a good rough approximation of the truth , and it 's easier to get , so the cost-benefit ratio makes it worthwhile . 
  i 'd rather have messy and noisy data than no data at all . 
  sure , there can be problems of bias , for example of stereotypes from the media driving people 's opinions and so making the whole thing wrong , but eh , that 's something you have to deal with all the time . 
  good points . 
   i do n't consider that xenophobic because to my mind dutch is n't inherently better than other cultures , and considering someone less dutch is n't a value judgement in any way even if we assume this is the only difference in treatment foreigners in the netherlands get compared to foreigners in the us , do n't you think it would be enough to make them feel `` less welcome '' ? 
  i * think * we mostly agree on the facts , and on the moral judgement of the facts ( i do n't think the fact that dutch people do n't see foreigners with different norms and languages as `` really dutch '' as blameworthy ) , and any disagreement is purely semantic ( does this mean it 's fair to say that the dutch are `` more xenophobic '' ? ), 
  and therefore not very interesting . 
  do you agree ? 
    do you disagree with this ? 
  if this hypothetical experiment was run , would you expect europe to score better than the us ? 
   i would expect europe to score better , yes . 
  i did n't find any very good metrics , but the closest i found was this https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/17/5-insights-on-the-racial-tolerance-and-ethnicity-maps-from-an-ethnic-conflict-professor/ ... and it does seem to show that americans are ( significantly ) less likely to say that they want a neighbour of a different race compared to most of europeans . 
  most of the time i do n't think it 's worth starting digging up evidence and whatnot until there are two people that a ) actually disagree on something ( and not just different names for things ) and b ) are interested in discussing it . 
  if the discussion is just gon na be : - * i think the sky is blue . 
  * - * you have n't provided any evidence of that . 
  * - * well here are ten papers supporting that . 
  [ ... ] * - * actually i always agreed that the sky is blue , i just wanted to see if you knew . 
  * ... a waste of time for all involved . 
  would you agree that `` overall , men tend to be taller than women '' ? 
  i would say that if someone had a hypothetical measure of `` xenophobia '' where you asked non-white people with a strong accent to walk around various countries , and report how much hostility or outright racist remarks they receive , then i would expect the average `` score '' to be worse for europe than it would for the us . 
  do you disagree with this ? 
  if this hypothetical experiment was run , would you expect europe to score better than the us ? 
  or do you expect the same outcome as me , but disagree that * `` overall , europeans tend to be more racist and xenophobic than americans '' * is a good way of summarizing it ? 
  we do n't know the * real * numbers , but we can guess , based on travel , reports from people who went around a bit , etc. 
  the general impression i get is that the us and canada are outliers in terms of being open to foreigners and to difference , and that standards of what constitutes unacceptable `` racist '' behaviour are more strict on their side of the atlantic . 
  sure , there 's a lot of variation from one european country to another ( for example , in france the official position is that ethnicity has nothing to do with french nationality , but that does n't hold in most other countries ) , and some groups ( african americans notably ) may report more racism in the us than in the other , but a generalization can still be made , as long as one knows it 's an approximation , based on faulty second-hand data . 
  the dude is asking for our opinion , not for a five-page essay with references . 
  if you disagree with me and think that on average , europeans tend to be * less * xenophobic than americans , then step up and say so . 
  * then * we have a disagreement . 
   that 's a pretty bold statement no it 's not !, 
  i added plenty of disclaimers , come on , any more and it becomes unreadable !, 
   the xenophobia/racism is not that big of a problem , honestly . 
  for the random average foreigner , probably not , but some specific groups might say it 's a problem : jews complain about increasing antisemitism from muslims , and the roma seem to be treated badly everywhere . 
  ( i do n't think racism/xenophobia is that big of a problem in the us either ), 
   i 'm pretty sure if you live here long enough to get citizenship most people wo n't even know you 're an immigrant . 
  in france or the uk probably , but in scandinavia or eastern europe i would n't bet on it . 
  i 'm not sure about * to what extent * each country is accepting of foreigners , but i 'd bet that none are more accepting than the us , and many are significantly less so . 
  hence `` tend to be '' . 
  and also hence `` depends of the country & area '' . 
  how many more disclaimers should i add ? 
  ( edit ) also i 'm a bit confused by your reply , because i 'm saying `` depends of your country '' and you seem to be answering `` no , wait , americans do n't realize that it depends of the country '' . 
  depends of the country & area ( rural poland is more xenophobic than paris or london ) , but overall , i 'd say that yes , europeans tend to be more racist and xenophobic than americans , especially towards the roma , arabs , and black africans . 
  how are you supposed to eat that without spilling / putting some all over your fingers ? 
  do you fold it in half ? 
  carefully balance it ? 
  the `` typical '' one would be the * jambon-beurre * : half a baguette with ham and butter : http://imgur.com/a/vabhq though more people probably eat some with more * crudit\u00e9s * ( tomato , lettuce ... ), 
  i wish there was a better relationship between the french state ( police , schools ... ) , and muslim immigrants . 
  ( externally , i 'd say we 're mostly fine - well , we and those treasonous english do hate each other but i see that more as a harmless cultural tradition rather than a source of problems ), 
  never thought of it , but yeah vienna would totally make sense . 
  best ally : the uk probably , though i answered the same to `` who is your sworn enemy ? '', 
  they did save our asses in both world wars , `` in flanders fields '' and all that . 
  best friend : germany . 
  i do n't think i ever met one of you , but from what i 've been hearing in this thread you seem like a fine lot , and i would be happy having a few of you around as an example of how islam can work alongside european culture . 
  european redditors say `` in my country , ... '', 
  france needs techies , and in a tech company english may be sufficient , though if you just drop by and look for a job it may be difficult ( you would better have a good idea of what you want to do , and ideally already have an offer - or come as a student ) . 
  as an asian you should be rather well received , if you do n't mind being greeted by `` konnichiwa '' or `` nihao '' . 
  also , our food , wine , and beaches are better than germny 's , 
  i 'd say - most people do n't care , except a ) a few far-right people , especially older ones , and b ) muslims , mostly because of israel ( but even then ... ) . 
  according to http://global100.adl.org/#country/france/2014 , 37 % of french people have antisemitic views ... but the only religion choices they have are `` christian '' and `` none/atheist '' - not having the muslims is a weird choice . 
  ( edit ) i was looking at 2014 data , 2015 data * does * have muslims , who as expected have a significantly higher score : http://global100.adl.org/#country/france/2015 it 's pretty weird how the numbers are * very * different from 2014 ... 
  yep . 
  at junior high school level ( * coll\u00e8ge * ) , there is n't * that * much , though i think individual schools can decide how to assign students ( and typically parents will try to get their kid into a `` good '' class by having him pick weird languages like german and greek ) . 
  at high school ( * lyc\u00e9e * ) , you have more splitting , but again this is often based on students ' chocies - you have * lyc\u00e9e professionnel * with more vocational training , and `` normal '' lyc\u00e9e which splits student into different orientations .
