   i think nowadays a billion people have an opinion about charlie hebdo but 99 % of these people do n't know anything beyond the fact that they were attacked by terrorists , and like two or three crappy cartoons that have caused outrage on the internet since then ... yeah , it seems a lot of foreigners think charlie hebdo is * only * about offensive cartoons , which is a bit like thinking reddit is only about / r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu / . 
  if charlie hebdo * only * consisted of those kind of tasteless offensive cartoons ( like a lot of foreigners seem to think it does ? 
  ) , then i might agree , but it does n't . 
  it also has articles that are serious and not that bad , and also some * actually funny * cartoons sometimes . 
  i have n't read any issues too recently , so i do n't know how good they are , but in the past they 're usually of decent quality . 
  why ? 
  they both cover wide ranges of tone and quality . 
  people just create stuff and publish it , i do n't see why publishing it on slices of dead tree means it should be held to a higher standard . 
  apart from charlie hebdo and others like this ( there are other less popular `` funny '' newspapers , i know of a couple in france at least and would be surprised if you did n't get them in other countries ) , there 's also the vast world of tabloids . 
  you 're right , i had totally forgotten about [ that one ] ( http://i-cms.linternaute.com/image_cms/400/1041588-bal-tragique-a-colombey-1-mort.jpg ) !, 
  it was pretty tame compared to what they do now , but then so was everything else at that time . 
  also their tagline used to be `` journal b\u00eate et m\u00e9chant '' , i.e. 
  `` dumb and mean newspaper '' . 
  such insensitive humour !, 
  thank god redditors [ never ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/imgoingtohellforthis ) [ make ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/toosoon/ ) that kind of bad-taste jokes . 
  well , it * is * a bit funny in the `` oh my god this is terrible i 'm going to hell for laughing at this '' sense . 
  tv tropes used to call it [ dead baby comedy ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/blackcomedy ) and has plenty more examples . 
  see also [ gallows humor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallows_humor ) . 
  and charlie hebdo and south park are among the masters at that genre ( otherwise they 're pretty different ) . 
  yeah , it 's not satire the way people usually understand the word . 
  it 's black humor , or offensive humor , or crude humor , but it 's not * satire * of anything . 
  so looks like now when i hear something of the news i 'll have to look for media from the other side of the iron curtain to find out what * really * happened ? 
  i do n't know off the top of my head , i 'll have to look them up if i vote in these primaries  i see him as somewhere between jupp\u00e9 and sarkozy . 
  that 's pretty much what sarkozy did and how he got elected . 
  and sarkozy was n't * that * bad , but his personality and rash actions made him unpopular . 
  if she ends the immigration madness , but also breaks the eu and euro by causing frexit , then the cure will have been worse than the disease . 
  what we need is n't one president that * really * does n't like immigration ; it 's more effective cooperation between all countries to enforce borders and handling of migrants . 
  and i do n't see le pen being better at that kind of cooperation than hollande is . 
  maybe she actually would be , hard to tell ( she has been an immigration lawyer after all ) , but i would n't bet on it , and i * especially * would n't want to risk breaking up the eu . 
  i primarily do n't want france to leave the eu * because that would suck for everybody involved , including france * . 
  yeah , it makes a difference , outsiders like trump are rarer but when they * do * get in , it 's an earthquake . 
  whereas the front national is more like a series of small tremors - `` omg they got elected in a city '' , `` omg they got to the secound round ( but got beaten soundly ) '' - `` omg they got more votes than the others on the first round '' , etc. 
  marine le pen wishes she was as popular as trump . 
  in france , as in the us , people somewhat hostile to the political establishment , but unlike in the us , this did n't give * that * many new votes to the nationalist anti-establishment right ( people are sick & tired of the le pen family too ) . 
  which is a good thing , because even though i do n't mind marine 's anti-immigration stance , i * do * dislike her anti-europe and anti-establishment stances ( i want boring but efficient bureaucrats like hollande or jupp\u00e9 , and european-level nationalism ) . 
  i do n't think she would be nearly as much of a disaster for europe as trump would be for the us ( except maybe if she makes us leave the eu ) . 
  article : http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2016/08/28/01002-20160828artfig00037-primaire-a-droite-juppe-et-sarkozy-font-desormais-jeu-egal.php recap of key numbers : http://i.f1g.fr/media/figaro/orig/2016/08/28/infe92ae5ca-6d45-11e6-abd3-179a17bb449d-805x321.jpg tl ; dr : jupp\u00e9 looks like he will win the primaries with a comfortable margin . 
  in the * best * case for sarkozy he gets more votes in the first round but gets beaten in the second . 
  sarkozy has always flirted with `` hard right '' positions , especially being tough on crime and immigration , which is part of why he was elected , so his recent declarations are nothing new . 
  i agree the climate has turned a bit ( public opinion is probably more concerned about immigration and islam than it was a decade ago ) , but probably still not enough to elect le pen , * especially * if the right puts forward a somewhat respectable and centrist candidate like jupp\u00e9 . 
  i think le pen is very unlikely , and sarko possible but still unlikely . 
  jupp\u00e9 or m\u00e9lanchon seem more likely . 
  hopefully jupp\u00e9 , or fillon . 
  i have n't been following the polls , but last i heard , jupp\u00e9 was pretty popular , whereas sarkozy is not ( like 50 % approval vs. 20 % approval ) , but that was for the population at large , not those voting for the primaries who will probably be closer . 
  i think jupp\u00e9 's odds are still better than sarko 's . 
  sarkozy represents nothing . 
  he probably wo n't even win his party 's primaries , despite his desperate calls for attention like this one . 
  paris syndrome is n't about crime , it 's about how some foreigners have this dreamy ideal romantic image of paris , and they are disappointed by the real paris . 
  there 's no `` frankfurt syndrome '' because come on , nobody has a dreamy ideal romantic image of * frankfurt * . 
   nowhere near as ~ ~ filthy ~ ~ quaint or ~ ~ crime ridden ~ ~ exciting . 
  ftfy, 
  you 're saying that based on what ? 
  so far hollande has mostly been criticized for being too business-friendly compared to the previous status quo . 
  and his term is now nearing an end , i do n't think we 'll be seeing new policies . 
  i speak and read neither , but had always heard that urdu was basically hindi written with the arabic script , but that otherwise they were as close as british & american english . 
  right , but french written with the cyrillic alphabet would still be french . 
  you ca n't * read * urdu , but if you hear it , you 'd understand it , right ? 
  seems totally sane , just like you do n't have austria pretending that the language they speak is not german but `` austrian '' . 
  urdu and hindi are another example of the same language being given two names for political reasons . 
  you 're imagining things , i would have said the same thing if it was say the german ambassador lecturing thailand on what thai identity is . 
  i may be missing some context , but ... how the heck is this any of his business ? 
  if this is an underhand way of encouraging the union of moldova and romania , it * might * work !, 
  same here , i learned more things from wikipedia and / r/askhistorians and blogs than from paper books ( i still read books , maybe 3 or 4 per year ? 
  i have n't been keeping count ), 
  a symbolic issue ? 
  clickbait title is clickbait . 
  is n't it * normal * that treaties are negotiated privately ? 
  that * any * negotiation is private , actually , so that parties do n't suffer the loss of face of having \\* gasp \\* changed their position ? 
  you 're right , it 's also the year `` starting '' so everybody wants to show they 're not on holidays any more . 
  i would expect that if macron was to run , he would be in either the left or the right primaries ( the latter are supposed to be * primaires de la droite et du centre * ) . 
  sarkozy and lepen are just preparing for the coming elections by making sure they 're in the news as much as possible . 
  since they 're both running on basically the `` anti-islam '' platform , they have to try to outdo each other with stupid outrageous propositions . 
  find japan in this table : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate, 
  i 'm not talking about writing them off as a lost cause , just taking them ( to get nearer the original topic ) as an example of the kind of diversity that * does n't * make things better ( on average ) . 
  i coild just as well have taken the somali , or maybe the afghans . 
  as far as i 'm concerned if someone says `` france should take in a million roma because the diversity will make france better , they 're * lying * . 
  that does n't mean france * should n't * take the roma in anyway , for legal or moral reasons . 
  check out [ this collection of anecdotes about the roma ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cz6s2/im_a_roma_girl_from_the_states_have_some/ ) . 
  sure , there are probably racist dickheads in that thread , but that 's the kind of response you always get when you ask europeans what their experience with romas has been . 
  i do n't think asking about the japanese will get those kind of anecdotes . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of good roma out there , but given the choice , i would n't take any chances and would definitely pick the japanese neighbors - and expect at least 95 % of europeans to do the same . 
  do you * truly * believe that japanese and roma have the same crime rates ? 
  ( i find that somewhat hard to believe ) i do n't know if `` statistically more likely to be a criminal '' counts as me `` hating '' the roma , but i do strongly dislike criminals . 
  i also think the whole roma situation is very bad for everyone involved and do n't really see a good way out of it . 
  what is your objection exactly ? 
  do you believe the odds of having problematic neighbors would be the same for both families ? 
  was it ? 
  maybe that part was over-represented in the german media , i ca n't say i remember anything like that , but then , i do n't remember much of his campaign anyway . 
  he 's been getting flak over having said that he was an enemy of finance and turning out not to be , i would n't be that surprised if it was the same thing with germany . 
  eh , good deeds never go unpunished , just ask the french how they feel about treacherous albion who saved our arses twice last century . 
  how about us ? 
  greece ? 
  not all `` diversities '' are equal - there are some kinds of people who will make things better ( entrepreneurs , workaholics , rule-abiding hygiene freaks , great cook , inventors , millionaires ) , and some kinds of people who will make things worse ( criminals , drug-dealers , people with no intention of working , violent assholes , religious nuts ) , some who are a mixed blessing ( workaholic religious nuts , millionaire assholes ) . 
  and while there 's a mix of all in all countries , the odds are n't stacked the same way , which is why i would rather have a family of japanese move next door than a family of roma . 
  and unless we know which kind of `` diversity '' we 're talking about , i 'm not sure the answer to the question is very meaningful . 
  this is sarkozy . 
  he 's ... special . 
  the others blame each other , or the banks , or europe . 
   you could find something like king solomon telling his wife to stone a disrespectful child of theirs , which could be interpreted by hardliners as `` stone all disrespectful children '' while another interpretation would say , no , just look at the context , it 's not what 's being said . 
  erm , [ it 's a bit more explicit than that ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+21%3a18-21&amp;version=kjv ) :  18 if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :   19 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;   20 and they shall say unto the elders of his city , this our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
