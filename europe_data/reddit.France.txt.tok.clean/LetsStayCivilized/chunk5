  at various points in time , the arabs ( the abbasid caliphate ) and the chinese have been `` better '' than us by most metrics . 
  * they * had the head start , not us , yet we still ended up `` winning '' . 
  while i agree * this * attack could have been avoided , i do n't think the nice one could have been prevented by reasonable policy changes - * maybe * a few more cops would have done the trick , but i do n't think it would have made * that * much of a difference . 
   europe has made its bed , and now it has to deal with it . 
  riiiight , and girls who wear miniskirts and makeup have themselves to blame if they get raped . 
   the problem is , in an unlimited competition in the field of entertainment , our culture gets eaten by hollywood and mtv . 
  the reason is that they are `` better '' , in a certain sense . 
  they are better at pushing the buttons of base instincts . 
  a lot of the `` traditional '' entertainment that 's been displaced is also sex and violence and cheap jokes : vaudeville , punch & judy shows , the carnival , circus clowns ... those push pretty `` low '' buttons . 
  you can definitely find smarter and deeper stuff in today 's big-budget hollywood . 
  so is it okay for the government to ignore the preferences of a group of citizens provided they are less than a majority ? 
  it might be a * pragmatic * choice by a politician , but hardly an admirable one . 
  sure , but you could use that argument ( `` what if an evil government came into power and abused it ? '' ), 
  about pretty much any tool of the government . 
  which is why i consider the things preventing an evil government from coming into power as way more important than the things that could be misused if an evil government comes into power . 
  note that i 'm not really arguing for the death penalty , i 'm just saying that i do n't mind it . 
  what you call `` coddling and pandering '' , others might call `` serving the will of the people '' . 
  it 's a government 's responsibility to serve the interests of it 's citizens , and while those citizens might not be the most qualified to judge details of government policies , they * are * the most qualified to judge what it is they want . 
  dismissing the preferences of half the population on account of them being `` authoritarians '' and therefor bad is failing to fulfill the government 's responsibilities . 
  some could even call it treasonous . 
  ... and does that mean it 's ready to take it 's plac in the eu alongside the uk and france ? 
  also , bombing the crap out of an army severely reduces it 's ability to harm you . 
  it 's not clear how much that holds with isis , but hey , it 's worth a try . 
  next : `` turkish police investigating those claiming investigating those talking about a hoax was a bad idea '', 
  we 're not talking about any specific country here , are we ? 
  mostly europe in general ... 
  no , it is n't , or else why have [ these guys ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/affaire_des_paras_de_francazal ) been in jail since 1991 ? 
  eh , that 's a bit of an abstract argument - in practice i do n't think that mistakenly sending someone to jail for the rest of his life is that much better than mistakenly killing him . 
  that some innocent people are treated as if they were guilty , and have their lives ruined , that is a great injustice , and i would care a lot for getting it reduced . 
  i also think it 's possible to reach a sufficient level of confidence in someone 's guilt - for example , anders breivik . 
  yes , there is a tiny probability that he 's actually innocent , but it 's so small that , who cares ? 
   human life can not be given back once taken so giving the state the right to take it away when it is fallible is wrong in the eyes of anybody who places the value of life where western civilizations do . 
  i do n't think `` western civilization '' itself puts such a high value on life . 
  a subset of westerners does , yes , but it 's not universal - and some appeal to the same abstract principle of `` value of life '' to argue against abortion . 
  i think that if anders breivik was executed , few people would think that it 's an injustice . 
  same for marc dutroux . 
  opposition to the death penalty is n't a deeply entrenched part of western civilization in the same way that , say , monogamy is . 
   it has also never been proved that killing people for their crimes helps increase lawfulness . 
  people who commit the kinds of crimes you can get executed over already operate under the assumption they will not be cought . 
  agreed . 
  that 's why i say that i do n't mind much either way . 
  i 'm a bit torn between the `` nationalists '' and the `` globalists '' . 
  by my life , background , friends and family , i 'm clearly on the `` globalist '' side - i have a lot of friends and family abroad and would n't have any problems living abroad , i tend to be in favour of free trade , european integration , boring bureaucrats . 
  but on the other side , i think a lot of people feel that their `` elites '' are betraying them , and in a sense , they are , and i do n't like being complicit in that even if i personally do n't mind that much . 
  i 'm lucky not to live in the middle of a crappy place like moelenbeck or sarcelles , with high crime and drugs and unemployment , and i 'm sympathetic to the people who live there and do n't want * even more * poor and somewhat hostile immigrants moving in . 
  and i feel that some people on the broad `` elite '' side are calling those people racist , instead of listening to them . 
  i personally do n't mind the death penalty , and do n't have objections to any countries that have it being in the eu . 
  i do n't see the death penalty as an important issue , one way or the other . 
  that being said , i do n't think turkey in it 's current state has anything to do in the eu , because of all the recent stuff that 's been going on ... rule of law , academic freedom , freedom of the press , due process , etc. 
  * are * super-important issues . 
  did isis take credit for that yet ? 
  a good article !, 
  ( i tried posting it last week and it got banned for being off-topic , glad to see this time it got through :p ), 
  europe is becoming a less violent place , and i do n't think the recent attacks will make a dent in those numbers . 
  see [ this article ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/crime_statistics ) for more background . 
  the section on homicides :  homicide is defined as the intentional killing of a person , including murder , manslaughter , euthanasia and infanticide . 
  it excludes death by dangerous driving , abortion and assisted suicide . 
  homicides are reported fairly consistently and definitions vary less between countries than for other types of crime . 
  the results presented are for completed homicides , except for latvia where the data include attempted homicide . 
  in some countries , the police register any death that can not immediately be attributed to other causes as homicide ; this heading may , therefore , be over-reported . 
    the number of homicides recorded per country is shown in table 3 . 
  the rate of homicides per 100 thousand inhabitants ( see figure 3 ) reveals a downward trend when comparing the average ratios for 2007 -- 09 with those for 2010 -- 12 : a decrease can be noted for all countries except for greece , malta and austria . 
  despite decreases in the homicide rates for the three baltic member states , the number of homicides per 100 thousand inhabitants remained higher in these countries than in all other member states . 
  ( i 'm bringing this up to counter the impression that you might get from the media or reddit , that europe is descending into bloody chaos ), 
  are you sure it 's a rise in violent acts and not just a rise in * reporting * of violent acts ? 
  the nice and munich are real violent acts , but then the stabbings seem more like `` background noise '' - plenty of murders go unreported every week , these just get reported because they fit a trend . 
  i do n't think even actual `` big '' attacks like nice make much of a dent in the figures of murder in europe see this : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:homicides,_average_per_year,_2007%e2%80%9309_and_2010%e2%80%9312_ ( per_100_000_inhabitants ) _ yb14.png and [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/crime_statistics )  the number of homicides recorded per country is shown in table 3 . 
  the rate of homicides per 100 thousand inhabitants ( see figure 3 ) reveals a downward trend when comparing the average ratios for 2007 -- 09 with those for 2010 -- 12 : a decrease can be noted for all countries except for greece , malta and austria . 
  i 'm okay with the de facto leadership , it 's not like there are much better choices ... 
  i 'm not a great fan of her handling of the refugee crisis , but on economy and finance i do n't see much to complain about . 
  other version with a bit more data : http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-03/terror-split2.png ( data for 2016 is incomplete ) the world is getting safer !, 
  do n't listen to media scares !, 
  also , the world is getting more peaceful : https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ourworldindata_wars-after-1946-state-based-battle-death-rate-by-type.png, 
   do you support the creation of an eu army ? 
  ( yes/no is enough ) yes . 
   would you join it voluntarily ? 
  no , unless there was a special need , e.g. 
  russia trying to invade finland . 
   would you support a draft ? 
  for a special need , like russia invading finland , yes . 
   would you sacrifice a year of two in basic training if mandatory ? 
  if it was mandatory i would n't have much of a choice , would i ? 
  so yes . 
   4 . b would you support mandatory basic training of an year or two no , unless there seemed to be an obvious need , like russia threatening to invade finland any minute now . 
   are you physically able to join it ? 
  ( gender does n't matter ) yes . 
   do you have relevant skills you could bring into it ? 
  i speak english and some german , i know my way around computers , electronics , etc. 
  other than that , nothing special . 
   which role/branch would you like to serve in ? 
  do n't know , i 'm not well versed in military stuff . 
  whatever i 'd be most suited for , i guess . 
  i do n't know !, 
  i 'm just saying that hey , apathy has it 's risks too . 
  i 've heard people from then-yougoslavia say that they used to not care about politics , not keep up with what was going on - and then a civil war fucked everything up , and they bitterly regretted not noticing the warning signs . 
   you want every country to work by the same regulations . 
  i do n't . 
  a unified europe does n't mean * all * regulations are the same . 
  you can have different regulations from one state to another , as happens in the us . 
  you can even have different regulation from one city to another .
