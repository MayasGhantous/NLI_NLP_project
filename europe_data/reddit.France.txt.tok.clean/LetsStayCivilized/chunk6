  but when the difference is pointless ? 
  abolish it , and make everybody 's life easier . 
   right , and what is stopping a shady organisation from falsifying such regulation - as that would never happen right ? 
  how the heck does adopting a common notation system make a difference ? 
  it 's like saying that the us passing from imperial to metric measures would cause more fraud , i mean , wtf ? 
  it is not , its great for corporations and shady organisations - it sucks for civilians who like the rules they live under , and dont want european regulations ( example prostitution/weed/bull running/drinking ages . . etc etc ) . 
  dude . 
  i 'm not talking about imposing new regulation , just making sure that countries that have regulation that 's aimed at the same goal make those regulations the same . 
  i mean , it 's a pretty simple concept . 
  i do n't know why you keep dragging irrelevant stuff in it . 
  say we have a hypothetical situation where different countries have regulation imposing that how much a car pollutes is indicated clearly when purchasing it - but slovenia indicates this with letters a to f ( a being best ) , and italy indicates this with a number from 1 to 10 ( 10 being the best ) . 
  and switzerland has two different criteria , particle emission and co2 , each with it 's own scale . 
  as a result , selling cars from one country to another is complicated , and manufacturers and sellers have to know all those regulations and adjust them . 
  i 'm talking about making sure all countries use the same scale ( this is hypothetical - as far as i know , they already do , thank you eu ) , so everything is simpler . 
  yes , this is good for corporations . 
  it 's also good for civilians . 
  it 's good for * everybody * . 
  it has nothing to do with `` losing culture '' ( the pollution warning label for cars is not a vital component of italian culture ) , it has nothing to do with one country having cheaper workers than another . 
  i think both people and countries should be able to enter agreements that restrict their future behaviour , because it can be in their interest to do so . 
  people get married , which means they are `` forced to '' take care of their children , or `` banned from '' having sex with anybody they want . 
  people get jobs , after which they are `` forced to '' be at work at certain fixed hours , `` against their will '' . 
  so if that 's what you mean by countries being `` forced to do things against their will '' , then yes . 
  i would like european to agree with each other on a common diplomatic/military decision procedure that they would all promise to follow , so that they can act more effectively as a whole . 
  `` tolerating '' up to a certain extent . 
  marine 's votes * have * been increasing ... 
  1 ) it worked for france in the 19th century , and does n't seem to have caused much of a push-back , even though france was more or less a democracy at that time 2 ) various people are * already * doing things to foster a common european identity ( i 'm thinking of arte , eurovision , the euro cup , european flags everywhere , learning about europe in school and in children 's books , exchange programs , academic collaboration ) , and it does n't seem to be causing much of a pushback . 
  what 's causing a pushback is * immigration * . 
  on that i can agree !, 
  however this common european identity * can * be pushed top-down , as [ has been done in france ] ( https://www.amazon.com/peasants-into-frenchmen-modernization-1870-1914/dp/0804710139 ) , and arguably as is being done in europe . 
  i certainly feel pretty european , tho i agree that there 's still a lot of road to go . 
  i 'm mostly sceptical about asserting grand principles like `` any true `` federalization '' can only come from the people , it 's either a bottom-up-process or it wo n't be a process at all '' - it 's a nice `` applause sign '' , people will cheer , but i do n't think the historical record actually supports that grand principle . 
  if you assert a grand principle based on like three data points , and then there are four historical counter-example , explaining how those counter-examples can still be kind of explained away is n't enough . 
  your grand principle does n't stand up . 
  ( still , it 's a nice slogan if you 're just trying to get people to cheer ), 
  i could see that working . 
  all hail / u/aboutdesouffle , dictator-for-life of unified core europe !, 
   french intervention in mali two years ago may not be possible in years to come without eu approval from all member states . 
  that condition would need to disappear before the eu can have a real diplomatic and military presence . 
  the us government is able to get stuff done without needing to ask all 50 member states , the european union should be able to do the same . 
  i want my interests to be represented internationally by a * powerful * entity . 
  which means : * a big stick : the military , the threat of embargo * a big carrot : the offer of trade , of opening markets * a capacity for taking effective decisions as is , the france has a smaller stick , a smaller carrot , but is more effective at taking decisions than the eu . 
  i 'll be willing to be represented by the eu once it solves it 's decision-taking power issue ( for example by establishing angela merkel as dictator-for-life and have every single european citizen swear fealty to her , but there are other possibilities ) . 
  eh , france was united through a pretty top-down process , and the end-result seems fine and unified ( a part from brittanny ) ( and from corsica ) ( and the basque ) ( and the 14th arrondissement of paris ) . 
  the roman empire was also built top-down , yet lasted pretty long . 
   why do we need to be in a united europe to do this tho , i can go work in dubai if i wanted to or visit my non existing aunt in china . 
  there 's much more paperwork , a different currency , different legal environments , it 's not clear how taxation or contributing to retirement funds work , etc. 
  possible , but with small hassles . 
  i 'd rather not have those hassles . 
    i 'm annoyed when europe could act in a unified way but does n't because of bickering - we could have better handled the syria and libya situations , the refugees , ukraine , those island china wants to grab , etc. 
  if we had our shit together . 
   i suppose that is because people inside the eu are not from one culture , and ofcourse have diffrent interests in said instable countries . 
  ofcourse you are going to have diffrent viewpoints - another reason to not unify , so we can actualy get things done . 
  our interests are not that different - for example , we 'd all rather have stability in nearby countries , we 'd all rather not have a bunch of refugees running around , etc. 
  and those kind of goals are better served with europe acting as a unified whole , both for negotiating with other states and for coordinating military and border-control actions . 
   so because some countrys in the eu have shitty regulations , the rest of the eu has to suffer ? 
  i do n't know where you 're getting that from . 
  even if all countries have * good * regulation , the mere fact that the regulations are * different * from a country to another creates waste . 
  that 's why i want more homogeneous regulations . 
  i want a more united europe for various reason : * i appreciate and care for fellow europeans , and want more opportunities to do things together , to visit each other , etc. 
  * i 'm annoyed when europe could act in a unified way but does n't because of bickering - we could have better handled the syria and libya situations , the refugees , ukraine , those island china wants to grab , etc. 
  if we had our shit together . 
  * i 'm annoyed at economic inefficiency that comes from stupid things like small differences in legislation ; a lot of people and companies waste time and money and lose opportunities because of that kind of bullshit , and some nice competent bureaucrats should be able to streamline all that , for everybody 's gain . 
  not according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algeria#languages ) :  although french has no official status , algeria is the second-largest francophone country in the world in terms of speakers , and french is widely used in government , media ( newspapers , radio , local television ) , and both the education system ( from primary school onwards ) and academia due to algeria 's colonial history . 
  it can be regarded as the de facto co-official language of algeria . 
  in 2008 , 11.2 million algerians could read and write in french . 
  an abassa institute study in april 2000 found that 60 % of households could speak and understand french or 18 million in a population of 30 million then . 
  in recent decades the government has reinforced the study of french and tv programs have reinforced use of the language . 
  i think he did an okay job when it comes to terrorism . 
  i do n't see which steps could have reasonably been taken to avoid that truck attack . 
  there 's not much you can do to detect a guy who up to now showed no signs of radicalization , and there 's not much you can do to stop a truck . 
  so yeah , we 're gon na have to learn to live with that kind of stuff . 
  there might be some solutions to reduce this in the long term - reduce immigration of the wrong kind of people , better integration ( like singapore !, 
  ) , break up the ghettos , finish bombing daesh , diplomatic work , root out funding , etc. 
  but there 'll never be 100 % security . 
  it 's [ being discussed on / r/france ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4tklio/une_m%c3%a8re_et_ses_trois_filles_violemment_agress%c3%a9es/ ) . 
  other info : * the eight-year old girl 's injuries are life-threatening ( `` very worrying '' according to the doctors ) * the guy ( surprise surprise ) is called mohamed, 
  nope , as far as i know psychologists agree iq is a useful measure with predictive value , not `` just '' how good you are at taking iq tests . 
  not that i 'm trying to prove something here , i 'm just taking cheap shots at isis ( and answering austere_fostere 's question ) . 
  people in france , morocco and tunisia often speak french - where * else * would you go look for a better life ? 
  ( canada 's a bit far , but a fair amount * do * go to belgium ) and that has been going on for more than a century . 
  so there are well-established communities , which makes it even more attractive . 
  as a result , some algerian food like couscous and merguez have pretty much become normal french dishes . 
  [ looks like 84 ] ( https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country ), 
  the 9/11 guys maybe . 
  the leaders . 
  but the guys who carried out the attacks in france these past few years ? 
  as far as i can tell they are mostly dumb low-life thugs . 
  the only numbers i found for france : http://www.csa.eu/multimedia/data/sondages/data2008/opi20080730-islam-et-citoyennete.htm a slight majority are in favor of ( partial or adapted ) charia law , i could n't find any numbers on homosexuality . 
  ( i 'm not arguing one way or the other , just showing what numbers i found ), 
  this might be one of them . 
  the iq threshold for isis membership is pretty low , and they only accept those who score * below * it . 
  seems that on reddit , for every comment complaining about islamophobia , there 's a hundred saying islam is a big problem and we need to do something about it ... 
  yep , and is from afghanistan , looks like i lost my bet . 
  out of the three most common symptoms - islamic nutcase , nationalist/right wing nutcase , and generic nutcase , i bet this time it 's `` generic nutcase '' . 
  ah , makes more sense , thanks !, 
  what is he replying to exactly ? 
  this part implies a pretty specific proposal :  sch\u00e4uble further clarifies one of the proposals , in which europe should inhibit further immigration ... at another points he 's talking about investing in countries in exchange for them withholding immigration , which does n't seem completely stupid ( provided they hold their end of the deal ), 
  hahahahahaha !, 
  europeans are as willing to be led by that guy as they are by [ the captain of the costa concordia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/costa_concordia_disaster ) ... 
   this is why there 's a problem with muslims , their values are outdated and completely alien to ours and the worst part is that they want to impose their regressive views on everyone you obviously have n't been talking with the same muslims i have ( or more likely , get all your impressions of muslims second hand or worse ),
