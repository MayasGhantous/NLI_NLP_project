  i do n't agree that malay and chinese are so close it `` does n't count '' . 
  the malays are muslims who belong to a completely different language group , i would consider them as far from chinese as algerians are from the french ( that is to say , still fairly close on a global scale , but different enough to cause tensions ) . 
  barbados seems to have [ a gini coefficient of 0.40 ] ( http://www.bb.undp.org/content/barbados/en/home/countryinfo/barbados.html ) , which is n't very far from the [ 0.328 of the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) . 
   my bar for `` successful diversity '' is a place where different races live alongside each other without one group oppressing/enslaving another , without political racial tensions , and without widespread racial hatred or racial stereotypes . 
  the only thing in that list that singapore seems to currently have is racial stereotypes , and i do n't see how the existence of those is a big deal - i do n't know of any place where groups of different ancestry live near each other and * do n't * have stereotypes about each other . 
   if france started printing `` race : european '' or `` race : african '' or `` race : arab '' on your id cards , and then french government officials used this information to tell you which apartment buildings are available for you to live in and which schools your kids will go to , how would you feel about it ? 
  if they do it in a non-stupid way ? 
  i may not mind much , singapore 's policy of breaking up ethnic ghettos by forcing people of all groups to live together seems to be working pretty well , better than the self-created ghettos in france and in the us . 
   name a country that is n't dominated by people of european or east asian descent that is successful . 
  [ the bahamas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bahamas )  in terms of gross domestic product per capita , the bahamas is one of the richest countries in the americas ( following the united states and canada ) , with an economy based on tourism and finance . 
  and  according to the 99 % response rate obtained from the race question on the 2010 census questionnaire , 90.6 % of the population identified themselves as being african-bahamian , 4.7 % european and 2.1 % of a mixed race ( african and european ) . 
  [ barbados ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbados ) also seems like a pretty successful place ( high litteracy , mixed economy , low perception of corruption ... ), 
  sure , if you set the bar for `` successful '' high enough you can argue that there are no places where diversity is `` successful '' . 
  the id card is n't in a format i 'm used to ? 
  not successful !, 
  you asked for an example of successful diversity ; you 've been given several and now have been moving the goalposts so that it has to be about africans and arabs . 
  if that 's what you meant you should have talked said so in the first place . 
   i challenge you to name a single city/region/country on the planet where diversity is successful . 
  singapore . 
   we are told that we need low-skilled workers who do not speak our languages because it makes europe more culturally interesting . 
  are we ? 
  i ca n't recall anybody saying stuff like that on tv or in speeches , how prevalent is this argument , really ? 
  how often are those kinds of arguments taken seriously ? 
  ( some random quote from tumblr or twitter does n't mean anything if nobody cares ... ) what i * do * hear is : * we have a duty to help war refugees , as european war refugees have been helped ( or should have ) in the past * watching people die at sea is not very nice * sending people back to their countries is often against various international conventions * getting organized enough to implement some kind of australia-style policy is pretty complicated ( the sea is easier to cross than the ocean around australia , there are land borders too , and there are many countries with their own rules and navies and whatnot to deal with ) ... none of this implies any kind of `` suicide wish '' . 
  constitutional courts will objects , populations will object , heck , even * the soldiers themselves * will probably disobey orders to kill boatfulls of non-aggressive civilian women and children . 
  i 've called it * `` tch\u00e9quie '' * for ages , and this is the first time i hear about this name change . 
  it may be photoshop , but [ it 's really the magazine cover ] ( https://garcon-magazine.com/magazine/garcon-magazine-n9/ ) . 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/medias/2058907-20170428-presidentielle-emmanuel-macron-fait-magazine-gay-garcon-torse-nu?utm_term=autofeed&amp;utm_campaign=echobox&amp;xtref=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter ) ? 
  we have * `` il y a anguille sous roche '' * ( `` there 's an eel under a rock '' ) , which means something secret is going on . 
  is n't this basically [ a map of population density ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/british_isles_population_density_2011_nuts3.svg ) ? 
  ( [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1138/ ) ), 
  well those endorsements are bound to carry a lot of weight on / r/europe ... 
  i 'd be okay with that . 
  i have n't got a clue . 
  i saw bruno lemaire speaking german on tv , and was surprised by how fluent he was ( my german is not good enough to tell how much of an accent he had ) . 
  weird but clever , i wonder if this will be useful to anybody ... 
  it would be nice ( it 's a well-design language that 's significantly easier to learn than `` natural '' languages ) , but english seems like better placed as a lingua franca in europe . 
  i 'm sure if you look hard enough you can find a book showing how adopting the metric system would cause widespread death and insanity too ... 
  even if they leave , they 're still a close ally . 
  and military agreements can work * better * if they are known . 
  what i know : * speak a weird isolate language that sounds like haarvaakaa vlaa blaa perkele rhavaa , as if it was invented by a child not very good at realistic world-building * lots of forests and lakes * people like isolation and tend to be introverts ( when sober ) * a bit of a reputation for alcoholism and violence * very impressive snipers during wwii * allied with the nazis , but we ca n't really blame 'em , stalin was trying to invade * kid 's do n't go to any formal school until something like six or seven years old * great education level * good at high technology ( nokia , angry birds ) * over-represented on the internet * everybody and his uncle is in a metal band * santa claus lives there, 
  hm , [ the brits say `` nah , it 'll just be a call center '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/20/new-eu-army-headquarters-branded-little-call-centre/ ) , so we 'll see , i guess . 
  what would be nice would be if they had it in strasbourg and put an end to the migrating parliament charade . 
  / r/france is divided on that guy , between those who think we should re-instate the death penalty just for him and those who find that a bit excessive . 
  [ good thing you 're ready for this then ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/69snw0/rle_canard_d%c3%a8s_demain/ ) . 
  ( edit ) [ ah , i see you have already imported that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/69sx45/the_donald_morgen/ ) , and [ locally produced a better version ] ( https://i.imgur.com/frckm3e.png ) . 
  i should have known that would happen with a common market and open borders !, 
  oh , sure , there are a few , but i 'd say that for every one of them , there are five to ten trumpkins . 
  see also [ someone asking why / r/le _ pen is all in english ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/697o2d/pourquoi_rle_pen_cest_tout_en_anglais/ ) , and [ someone on / r/le _ pen asking if there are any french people around ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/le_pen/comments/69knkh/yatil_des_fran%c3%a7ais_sur_ce_sub/ ) . 
  do you have [ episodes like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/69mb5o/rle_canard_right_now/ ) ? 
  / r/france is pretty lively , with it 's own lingo that is usually deliberately bad translations - shitpost is `` cacapoteau '' or `` compost '' , crosspost is `` croixpoteau '' , etc. 
  there 's a mix of memes , politics , international news , personal problems , etc. 
  the election time was pretty entertaining , with people from / r/the _ doofus coming over avd shilling for le pen , usually very badly . 
  chirac was really good at that . 
  have a pm pass an unpopular reform , fire him , get a new pm , start again . 
  i 'm french and fine with closing the parliament in strassburg . 
  admittedly i do n't live there , the locals probably mind , but if they get the european defense headquarters or something they may be fine ... 
  i 'm french and strongly pro-eu , which is one of the reasons i voted for macron , and i think i 'm far from being alone - i think the anti-europe stances of both le pen and melenchon hurt them ( le pen trying to explain on live tv how she would make germany go back to the mark did n't help her ) . 
  the french overall have high approval rates of europe and even [ of merkel ] ( http://www.lejdd.fr/international/europe/les-francais-plebiscitent-merkel-706588 ) . 
  a lot is okay but ... poor italy . 
  and spoil the view from the butte montmartre ? 
  are you talking about nicolas tessilly ? 
  apparently more like 31 %, 
  the northeast is basically the french rust belt . 
  he did n't give one yet . 
  it looks like there 's a band of prosperity that goes around france 's border - just like the chernobyl cloud did . 
  yeah , and trump wished to make america great again , but he 's an incompetent buffoon so i 'm not holding my breath . 
  i do n't know enough about melenchon to tell whether or not he 's an incompetent buffoon ( he 's probably better than trump , but then so is my baker ) , but macron certainly seems like a more competent statesman . 
  i value competence way more than `` wishing '' . 
  until a few months ago , it was expected she would finish first . 
  she did n't , and by a comfortable enough margin , she has to stop calling herself * `` le premier parti de france '' * . 
  pretty likely . 
  against m\u00e9lanchon , she * might * have had a chance , but against macron , it 's going to be hard . 
  ( i 'm french and voted for macron - he seems like a pretty competent , gutsy and pro-europe guy ! ), 
  `` if you ca n't handle me at my worst you do n't deserve me at my best . '', 
  ther are pros and con but overall i suspect moving closer to `` at-will '' employment would improve things in france at least . 
  mostly because it would make it less risky to hire people , which should create more jobs and encourage `` risky '' hires - minorities , people with less education or work experience . 
  when i hear hercule i think of a cat . 
  a male cat , but still a cat . 
  i guess it depends of whether you prefer larcenet or turk & de groot . 
  jules ( * `` mon jules '' * is old-fashioned slang for `` my man '' ) raoul , marcel ( also a bit old-fashioned , call in mind a stereotype of a somewhat low class guy in a wifebeater from the south who likes to drink * pastis * and play * p\u00e9tantque * ), 
   `` shakespeare '' is the answer to too many questions about the english language which would have different answers for french . 
  in theory maybe . 
  in practice if you ask 100 frenchmen who they would consider to be france 's shakespeare , i expect you 'll hear more than 90 `` moli\u00e8re '' ( and zero `` du bellay '' - who is that guy ? 
  rabelais has better chances of being named ) . 
  some french ones i have n't seen yet : * saoul comme un polonais * - drunk as a pole * fort comme un turc * - strong as a turk ( very strong ) * quart d'heure am\u00e9ricain * - the american fifteen minutes ( at a dance , when the women invite the men ), 
  i 've never seen root beer in a french supermarket , but i may not have checked very carefully . 
  dr peppers , maybe . 
   peanut butter most supermarkets should have it , but you might find it in the `` exotic food '' area , along with ramen , maple syrup and guacamole . 
   jam/jelly/preserves you 'll definitely find plenty anywhere . 
   ready to eat meals ( such a this ) . 
  basically a frozen meal you can throw in the microwave and heat then eat you 'll find some at any corner store , supermarket , etc. 
   common breakfast items croissants , pain au chocolat , and coffee you mean ? 
   cereals there are plenty , they tend to be for kids . 
   common beverages you 'll find coke , fanta , ice tea etc. 
  pretty much anywhere ( including many * boulangeries * ) , but you wo n't find root beer or dr peppers . 
  you will find * orangina * though . 
   common condiments ketchup , mayonnaise and mustart ( a lot of kinds of mustard ! ) . 
  you probably wo n't find relish . 
   when it comes to pasta do you buy dry pasta/canned sauce or make from scratch ?
