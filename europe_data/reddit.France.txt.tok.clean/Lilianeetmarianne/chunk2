  anything and everything said about brussels regardless of how factual the statements are , are considered an attack on the flemish . 
   vrije universiteit brussel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vrije_universiteit_brussel lol , the dutch flag and everything . 
  those nationalists and that pseudo university for sure objectively educated you about the country . 
   not that it matters , but least you forget the capital region is also wholly located in flanders we 've territory in the middle of the pacific and in latin america , the location is indeed entirely irrelevant . 
   flanders plays a very marginal role in brussels , it is not responsible for integration in brussels and thus it should mind its own business . 
  the flemish community government does not exist , there 's just a flemish government and yes , as stated above they do play a role in brussels . 
  they 're responsible for the education of perhaps 10 children in brussels . 
  the rest goes , logically , to french schools provided by the federation . 
   creating random organisations with brussels doe 's not suddenly mean wallonia own 's it , everything is officially bilingual . 
  http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat/structure  at the top level , ** we now find the federal state , the communities and the regions , all three of which are equal from the legal viewpoint . 
  ** they are on an equal footing but have powers and responsibilities for different fields . 
  the federation wallonie-bruxelles is not a random organisation , it stands on an equal foot as the federal government , the walloon government , the german speaking government and the flemish government . 
  it is a community government , the government of the francophone . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_community_of_belgium belgium is way more complex than you think it is , educate yourself before you mindlessly start defending the flemish just because they 're `` not french '' . 
  jesus christ , you 're only making a fool out of yourself . 
  no one ever would call bourgeois a belgian minister , not in wallonia nor in flanders . 
  it is factually incorrect . 
  he is not a belgian minister , belgian does not refer to his citizenship but to the government he is representing . 
  though you 've never claimed to be one but are you even belgian ? 
  bruxelles is part of the `` federation wallonie-bruxelles '' ( governing education , culture and so forth ) and it is its own r\u00e9gion ( governing infrastructure , energy and tons of other things ) as well . 
  flanders plays a very marginal role in brussels , it is not responsible for integration in brussels and thus it should mind its own business . 
  factually incorrect . 
  belgian ministers refer to ministers in the federal gouvernment of belgique . 
  it is like calling the dutch minister of whatever a european minister/commissioner , that only leads to confusing as people will think the minister works for the ue . 
   what will happen to brussels if flanders becomes independent ? 
   if belgium still exists somewhere , then it is in brussels . 
  while flanders and wallonia continue to grow further apart , brussels is increasingly to be considered as the child of the deteriorating marriage between flemings and french-speakers . 
  both parents must continue to care for that child . 
  furthermore , brussels is the unofficial capital of europe and the home base of many international institutions . 
  brussels therefore remains an extremely important city for flanders , even if far fewer flemings are living there now . 
  ** consequently , the n-va definitely does not want to let brussels go . 
  **  historically , brussels is a flemish city and brussels is geographically situated in flanders , but over the years , brussels has also become a french-speaking city and a city in which social groups with totally different origins live . 
  there is n't a single social group that has a right to claim brussels . 
  a further dismantling of belgium means that a unique solution must be found for brussels , where the city can be governed by both flemings and french-speakers with respect for all of the social groups that are living there . 
  http://english.n-va.be/frequently-asked-questions#europe you 're from new zealand , mind your own business . 
  and if you can not , at least inform yourself . 
  he is not a belgian minister , he is a flemish minister . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geert_bourgeois  he is since 2014 the current ** minister-president of flanders ** and ** flemish ** minister for foreign policy and immovable heritage . 
  please do n't ask me to explain belgian politics to a belgian ? 
  he is probably crying about flemish media not reporting on it , which would 've benefited him and his party . 
  do n't care , it is francophone territory . 
  whenever i am in bruxelles it feels , breaths and smells like france . 
  hell , it pretty much is france . 
  the flemish need to mind their own business . 
  though , for the record , i am not saying that i disagree with the flemish prime minister . 
  silly occitans and wallonians . 
  typical british media being demagogues again . 
  france bashing sells like hotcakes across the channel . 
  molenbeek is n't in flanders , it is non of his or his government 's business . 
   van der steur also said that judges were imposing shorter sentences , meaning criminals were spending less time on average in jail . 
  explains it partly though . 
  also , is n't the netherlands famous for its youth beating up paramedics and emts ? 
  denying homophobic sentiments in poland is being part of the problem . 
  poles are homophobic , at least those who are here in france . 
  documentaries about your country on this topic including testimonies of people within the lgbt community in poland confirm what i wrote earlier , there 's still a lot of work to be done . 
  you 've progressed though and that should be applauded . 
  how many of these people does berlin have ? 
  holy shit . 
  there is a difference between hearing and listening . 
  they hear us and sometimes they listen to us . 
  we are both un security council members , they consider our position as do we theirs . 
  you guys are free though to believe in your delusional fantasy that france and the uk are just as irrelevant as your own countries . 
  the real heart of the union is in strasbourg . 
  brussels , frankfurt and luxembourg are just there for diversity/neutrality reasons . 
  a lot of bad decisions are still being made to this day , case in point : merkel . 
  all of western europe did , we have banlieues like clichy-sous-bois . 
  they 're utter hell . 
  in france we call those , `` territory the republic lost '' . 
  it does last 60 minutes , but just a tiny portion is dedicated to sweden . 
   now who 's a the triggered clown ? 
  triggered because i wrote more than a single sentence ? 
  ha , nice one !, 
  the cognitive weak need more explaining than others , that 's all i 'm doing . 
   i was not clear enough and wrote misleadingly in other words , you were wrong . 
   you have never been more split as a people . 
  do you even know anything about the republic ? 
  gee , i 'd say the conflicts between the aristocrats and the bourgeoisie that led to the revolution were for more critical than some poor , uneducated muslims creating a parallel society within france but who am i , right ? 
   france remains as a nation strong but the split between ethnicity and culture will be the final nail in your coffin . 
  there is a split between cultures , not ethnicity or race . 
  i 'll give you that . 
  how that is going to end the republic , i have no clue . 
  we 're more lenient than you give us credit for , we 've always stood up after being beaten down and if the polarization between islamic culture and french culture turns out to be as big of a problem as you 're claiming it to be , you 'll get through that as well . 
  the nation , the republic will never cease to exist . 
  hahaha !, 
  what a bunch of morons !, 
  say goodbye to social security , funded education , decent healthcare and so forth if the borders are open for all . 
  i really do n't get how these people even exist !, 
  strasbourg is in france , get over it . 
  of course not but at least they 're not attacked anymore for holding hands . 
  it 's progress , we should applaud that and encourage them to do more . 
   and i do n't think ukraine will join us soon . 
  never said that 'd be soon . 
  seems kinda contradicting to visit a sub dedicated to europe if you do not care about the continent . 
  then again , the cognitive weak have flocked this sub since recently so i am not surprised . 
   but i find it funny how france is still flexing despite not even managing their own affairs . 
  we were never , nor will we ever be able to manage our internal affairs . 
  we are fundamentally a chaotic state . 
  despite that we have ruled the world in the past and to this day we are still capable to exert power abroad . 
  something only the uk can do as well in europe . 
   hell i would n't be shocked if you ended up as failed state , pretty sure no one expected soviets to collapse in 80s , but i could see france collapsing in 2030 ~ well i am convinced your easily triggered mind is telling you that .
