  the issue is when other southern european countries like italy , spain , or portugal get no criticism whatsever contrary to france, 
  when did the media ever praise spain ? 
  and what is air france ? 
  from what i 've read i though most territory of non ethnic russians were quite autonomous no ? 
  i can tell you no one in france gives a shit for those reasons . 
  germany invaded france 3 times in the past 150 years and it 's arguably the country france is closest to . 
  we fought turkey abroad , they did n't invade france for 100s of years . 
  we 'll laws were reformed in france for this . 
  before the police had no right in refusing someone who has yet to do a crime to travel where they want . 
  a french person not complaining of air france ? 
  i do n't think any french person has a grudge against turkey for fighting us 1.000 years ago . 
  some balkan countries might care , rest of europe really do n't give a shit of wars that happened hundreds of years ago . 
  i think he 's comparing ottoman empire with imperial russia , not ussr . 
  he says `` there are a lot more ** recent ** reasons for russiam hostility '', 
  french media basically suck germany 's balls . 
  everytime they show economic problems ( which is extremely often . . ) they go - `` and how does germany compare ? '', 
  and basically tell us we should do everything like germany . 
  there is a little backlash from extremist parties . 
  for example , melanchon - former leader of the communists frequently criticizes germany and how they treat workers badly , their numbers do n't say the full story , there is larger amount of poor people on germany than france etc. 
  but melanchon is kind of an asshole and insults everybody so only his supporters would back him on this . 
  germany is usually viewed as the succesful model of economic growth . 
  we admire how they 're doing so well but also like to always point out which aspects were doing better in !, 
  i do n't think europeans have a lot of lessons to give when it comes to enslaving people . 
  let 's make it clear , the hostility towards turkey is they are a populous muslim nation very close to europe . 
  before khadaffi used to stop migrants going to europe , now trafickers profit of no stable government and make millions off of migrants . 
  aswell as this isis is pretty new . 
  then there is also eritrea , somalia in east africa . 
  do you know how expensive it is to pay for the passage ? 
  the people who are trying to escape are not starving to death , they are looking for a better life . 
  like people from rural areas going to the big city to find a job . 
  passage costs several thousand euros . . 
  did you read what i said ? 
  is there a popular revolt and civil war occurring there ? 
  khadaffi was n't attacked just because he was a dictator , but because he was a dictator during a popular revolt who was ready to bomb 1000s of his citizens , which is n't the case in eritrea . 
  is there a poplar revolt and a civil war occurring in eritrea with a dictator killing his own people and saying he will kill thousands more to hold on to power ? 
  there are loads of dictators in the world yes , being a dictator is not the same as having an extended civil war . 
  no it is n't . 
  france issued a euro coin commemorating austerlitz that was legal only in france . 
  belgium wanted to release a waterloo coin that would be used all over europe . 
  i think it makes sense that some people do n't want a coin commemorating war between european nations on a coin to be used all over europe . 
  france vetoed the coin to be used throughout europe but belgian is perfectly to use it how they wish inside their own borders . 
  it was perfectly legal . 
  romanians and bulgarians could only stay 3 months before needing proof of employment . 
  those without it were illegaly staying in france . 
  the controversy was over the heavy handed methods used to repatriate the roma to their countries . 
  australia has a similar policy with pacific islands . 
  it 's quite criticized by many ngos though and is compared to guantanamo . 
  it 's probably because most people have `` informal '' jobs . 
  what ? 
  nowhere do they say the country belong to anyone , they 're saying we 're in our home . 
  no france either for some reason . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  european countries ( apart from germany ) have been doing less well as eu has gotten less integrated , there is much less flexibility . 
  for example france is not competitive enough , if we could control our currency our production would be cheaper , however we do n't control our currency ( euro ) and we are less competitive than when we had the franc . 
  not to mention emerging economies like china and india challenging western countries is pretty recent . 
  until recently european nations were even more powerful than today . 
  germany was the # 1 exporter until being surpassed by china less than 5 years ago . 
  economies not competitive on the international playing field germany , uk , and france are 4,5,6 th economies in the world behind usa , china , and japan . 
  the riots were caused by the death of a black man in a prominent afro-carribean area of london , tottenham . 
  first riots were from tottenham 's afro carribean community , then it spread and was mainly poor people . 
  there have been several riots in brixton in the past aswell , another very black area of london , because of police brutatlity to black locals . 
  birmingham and marseille for example . 
  many areas in paris , london , lisbon , berlin , naples , amsterdam , bruxelles etc, 
  in london 's situation it was blacks and it was police violence that caused riots . 
  because among the many issues facing the black community they are treated more brutally by the police than other communities . 
  there are studies that show that black males are much more likely to be searched , more likely to be found guilty for equivalent crimes , get longer time for equivalent crimes etc. 
  added to that police in the us has b en `` militarizing '' itself . 
  so you have a group of people who are much more persecuted and a very violent police who is a little gun happy , it 's not a surprise people will feel offended . 
  by the way did you hear how the person in baltimore died ? 
  he was suspected of dealing drugs , beaten up by several policemen who broke his spine . 
  he begged to go to the hospital . 
  police did n't listen to him , by the time they finally brought him there he did n't survive his injuries . 
  except there have been problems for a long time that both governments did n't act on . 
  governments impose regulations and taxes as well . . 
  there is a lot of foreign involvement in congo for example . 
  not necessarily western , biggest involvement are probably rwandan back militias . 
  africa is one of the regions with the highest gdp growth so it 's not like nothing is being done . 
  nice charicature by ny times . 
  charlie hebdo would be proud . 
  thats pretty much already been the case . 
  italy used to have deals with libya before and spain still does with morocco . 
  arab spring made the situations more difficult . 
  but ofcourse this should be pursued more again . 
  most illegal immigrants leave from libya or syria . 
  you ca n't make agreements with them because there is no functioning government !, 
  how does one put a stop to illegal immigration completely ? 
  those are retarded suggestions, 
  i have no plan or desire to learn berichon , does n't mean i ca n't lament the disappearance of a language and culture . 
  and i have learned and am planning to learn foreign languages . . 
  i think you 're getting all confused cus your trying to prove an `` anti-nationalism '' point without really understanding what i 'm advocating . 
  i and many people enjoyed a world with a lot of cultural diversity . 
  this goes for small cultures in france , and in togo , china , bolivia , australia etc etc. 
  when i see tibetan and uighur being persecuted for keeping their culture , for me that 's a shame . 
  same for ** any ** small culture in the world . 
  globalization is reducing cultural diversity and for me as well as other people that 's a shame . 
  you calling me xenophobic or supremacist ( really berichon supremacy ?? 
  is that a joke !? 
  it 's one of the poorest and most insignificant regions of france . 
  berichon are the victims , not the supremacists ) is very offensive and misguided . 
  you do n't have to agree with the value of cultural diversity , do n't wrongly label those that do .
