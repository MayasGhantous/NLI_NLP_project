  we have huge taxes which discouraged companies from investing in r&d and even encourages many people to do business outside of france . 
  we have a good workforce but are more expensive than germany for example . 
  basically lack of competitivity . 
  the socialist government is trying to remedy this mainly by the macron reforms whcih reduce red tape for industries . . http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aa6aa9b2-bd95-11e4-9d09-00144feab7de.html#axzz3xud6zsov but at the same time eu imposes deficit reduction which means taxes are increasing for ordinary people !, 
  bascially france is having a very tough time , but hopefully high growth will soon return . 
  also would have made it a nice breading ground for islamists . . 
  china is also setting up many factories in ethiopia . 
  chinese wages are becomming too high ( ! ), 
  so they are relocating to ethiopia to also take advantage of less distance to european and mid east markets . 
  actually there are a few french posters here including me who agree that local languages should be more encouraged . . however its not a majority position in france which imo is a shame . 
  whats the point of any culture then ? 
  why should people care that amazon indians get kicked out of their land and their resources poached , they should just convert to the dominant culture and everyone speaks english and watch american tv . 
  thats not the world i want to live in . 
  people should be proud and use their cultures , it has nothing to do with supremacy . 
  its the opposite of supremacy , miniority cultures are being destroyed by more dominant ones . 
  my father can speak berichon , today the language is all but dead . 
  tomorow the culture of the region may be replaced by shopping malls and multination companies . 
  trying to preserve berichon culture is ethnic supremacy and xenophobia ? 
  i still think there 's more that can be done . 
  bayrou is made fun of often , but his program has interesting topics on local languages and traditions which none of the major parties propose http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/id=25365 . 
  on the local level also there are also proponents whose ideas are not taken ( used to live in nice outskirts ) . 
  i dont think we need to make local languages mandatory but there is definitely more that can be done . 
  a big example are the new regions which completely ignore a lot of historical regions , and here there were a lot of protests which werent listened to . 
  the issue is that preserving local languages has never been a policy of the left or the right in france , so only local and some central parties take it up which everyone ignores . 
  lack of support for regional languages was actually not originally a conservative policy . 
  it was post french revolution in order to make the whole country united , and no distinctions between `` posh '' french and `` backwards '' local languages . 
  today though i agree , more should be done to promote local languages . 
  there is a reason very few people can speak regional languages . . 
  bbc had an article on the subject . 
  an issue is that polish bikers go to russia frequently to commemerate polish getting killed by the soviet union . 
  an issue if poland refuses the russians to enter there they could replicate . 
  imo the russians should just find another root . 
  no need to provoke people . 
  whats your point ? 
  belgium is also the country that trained near 0 elite unlike other colonials , had the least post colonial plan , encouraged racial hierarchies in rwanda etc. 
  colonial powers in africa . 
  nice post . 
  i would n't call the later belgian colony a model either . 
  belgian were particularly bad as colonials . 
  rwanda is another belgian colony . 
  actually ussr usually did n't meddle in areas that were in western influence . 
  in italy and france for example communists were the biggest party and ussr would tell them not to try to take power but to stay in opposition . 
  we had a student protest in france in 1968 with massive strikes that lead to the head of state ( general de gaulle ) fleeing to west germany and eventually anticipated elections . 
  students wanted a left wing government . 
  guess what ? 
  french communist party and ussr were against the protests and for general de gaulle to stay in power . 
  ussr did n't want to provoke the west in ways they could n't control . 
  if you read about nazi occupation in europe you find out the vast majority of people just want to live their lives and survive . 
  there 's a reason there was more armed resistance in east europe than in west . 
  nazis were much more gentle when occupying western europe . 
  there 's also a lot of history about how britain treated the communists who fought off the nazis . 
  britain initiated a civil war to reinstate the monarchy even though the communists were the most popular in greece . 
  it 's the same in france aswell and i imagine other european countries . 
  hollande has actually cut spending and liberalized the economy with macron law . 
  and france has no growth but were not in recession anymore - 0 %, 
  great comment man , / r/bestof material . 
  fracking is very controversial in france and it will remain illegal for some time . 
  headbutts is how men great in black africa . 
  i am french who has taken universtiy courses on political ideology in the uk . 
  as you say an issue is that liberal has different meanings . 
  in france liberal means right wing economically as you say while in the us its sort of this gauche caviare that wants decent taxes and gay rights , and drive their big cars to drop their kids at soccer practice in suburban homes outside of black communities . 
  here im taling about the ideologies , the definitions you will see in a political book . 
  the ideology of ** liberalism ** is different than the ideology of neoliberalism . 
  look at the difference of ideologies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_ideologies . 
  just looked at the english and french definition and its the same thing . 
  im not talking of classical liberalsim . 
  im using modern defitions . 
  liberals of today are not the same as neoliberals of today . 
  to put it crudely a liberal wants personal liberties protected , but wants big services like railways and energy run by a government company , wants more oversight on financial markets , wants a progressive tax etc. 
  a neoliberal wants private companies to take over whenever possible , because privatization brings more competition and therefore higher quality in his or her view . 
  he wants less tax because individuals know how to use their money better than bureaucracies . 
  atleast this is the definition that 99 percent of platforms would have of liberalism and neoliberalism . 
  i get the feeling you hold another definition for some reason . 
  also for some reason you downvote me right after i post . 
  liberalism is a political ideology . 
  its not necessarily low government intervention as it seeks to protect individual liberties . 
  this means equal laws for everyone , democracy , protection of private property , right to trade etc. 
  no , neoliberalism is not more government intervention . 
  do you know what neo means ? 
  it means new , not more . 
  social democracy , liberalism are complex political ideologies . 
  they are not just defined by more or less government intervention as you do . 
  reagan imposed the police state , the drug war and interventionism . - in terms of economics , reagan introduced many neoliberal policies to the us . 
  google neoliberalism and come back to me , how bout that ? 
  people are talking about neoliberalism , which to put it crudely is less government intervention and more privatization . 
  popularised in the us in the late 70s and pushed by thatcher and reagan who imposed it on latin american countries . 
  lol what ? 
  again -  this is just my personal experience of people that surround me and that i talk to . 
  3 months ago i wasnt even in france , these are opinions i am hearing ** today ** . 
  and with the russian offensive in syria there will be even more refugees . 
  no , i dont have evidence or comprehensive surveys , this is just my personal experience of people that surround me and that i talk to . 
  ofcourse there are many people that are against refugees comming in france . 
  today this is a topic that is discussed a lot and i have yet to speak to one person who says france should not do more for refugees . 
  again , this is my personal experience , im in a business school here and most people are middle class and in their 20s . 
  im talking of my personal experiences , not people i speak to on the internet . 
  reddit is the only forum i go to and im mainly on / r/soccer . 
   before the massive influx of migrants , most people here were very sympathetic towards them . 
  you do realize there is a reason for the masive influx of migrants ? 
  and that is because there is a huge war going on in syria where thousands of people are getting killed and are fleeing for their lives ? 
  there needs to be discussion to find a better solution .
