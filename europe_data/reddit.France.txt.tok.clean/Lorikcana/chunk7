  and a better solution is not `` let everyone go to germany '' , nor is it `` close all the borders '' . 
  we need a long term solution to a humanitarian crisis that is happening at our doorstep . 
  countries like lebanon and turkey are hosting millions of refugees , europe , aswell as the rest of the world has its part to play , doesnt mean they take everyone either . 
  its funny when vietnamese were fleeing their dictatorship the whole world mobilized to help them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnamese_boat_people . 
  the president of france , chirac , even adopted one as his daughter . 
  now that the refugees are middle eastern its more of a problem . 
  some mayors are even saying they will only take christian syrians . 
  same in france , plane is cheaper than tgv . 
  have you lived in another european country ? 
  i lived in the uk and it was fucking amazing having the option of a 10pound or so ticket ( bought the same day ) that takes you to the other part of the country . 
  ive just done a quick search for a london to newcastle trip . 
  the cheapest fare for a bus ticket tomorow is 19 pounds , http://coach.nationalexpress.com/nxbooking/journey-list , the cheapest train fare is 121 pounds ... http://www.thetrainline.com/buytickets/combinedmatrix.aspx?command=timetable#journey/london/newcastle/24/10/15/01/30/dep//////dep/1/0// france is liberalizing the market , allowing more competition for transportation . 
  this will lower the prices for * everyone * . 
  im living in france now and the cheap option for young people is bla bla car . 
  you think this is safer than busses ? 
  im a 24 year old french ( i even live in one of the most right-wing french regions ) , and this sub is extremely more conservative than the people i see around me . 
  i imagine this is the case for the majority of west europe, 
  reddit is mainy middle class relatively young people in 20s and 30s . 
  this subgroup ( in france atleast ) tends to be very supportive of refugees , much much more than / r/europe . 
  i suspect most people of this demographic in western europe share similar views . 
  yeah you can say this . 
  in speech the right fringe of the r\u00e9publicains ( former ump ) is today almost indistinguishable from the fn when it comes to immigration , national identity , and security . 
  on the other hand when it comes to european union , economics , foreign policy it 's quite different . 
  centre right in france is a descendant of gaullism ( the policies of general de gaulle ) which is conservative , but also wants france to have a leading role in the world . 
  far right is more also socially conservative . 
  however they do n't mind sacrificing french `` prestige '' for national sovereignty , identity , etc. 
  the problem is that both movements are getting closer together . 
  the fn of marine le pen is very different than her father . 
  the far right was anti de gaulle as they were seen as traitors who gave up on algeria and the 1 mil french who lived there . 
  far right tried assassinating both de gaulle and chirac . 
  today they have a more gaullist attitude , but still much more isolationist than centre right . 
  in fact you can say de gaulle was also quite isolationist , trying not to pick a side in cold war and being friends with everyone ( kicked nato out of france , one of the first to recognize communist china ) . 
  so today marine le pen 's fn is much more close to de gaulle than her fathers generation . 
  it 's funny because there is currently a debate on this in france . 
  a centre right politician got caught in a controversy for saying france is a country `` of white race '' . 
  in france , race is not recognized , and this is totally against the principles of the french revolution which we live under - being french is following some principles and has nothing to do with race and religion . 
  this politician claims she was quoiting de gaulle . 
  she had a meeting yesterday with de gaulle symbol 's everywhere as she is trying to appeal to the right fringe of the centre right . 
  however her message is almost indistinguishable from marine le pen . 
  sorry for the huge post !, 
  got kind of carried away . 
  political spectrum in europe is broader than in the us . 
  i think what he means is that there are conservative ( centre right ) comments ( ones that would be held by cdu in germany , tories in uk , republicains in france , etc ) but few `` far right '' comments that marine le pen , griffin , fdp , lega nord etc hold . 
  the problem with this is that sometimes the speech of the centre right is very close to the far right . 
  in france in particular this is the case . 
  you 're probably right, 
  / r/europe is much more on the right than the general population of youngish europeans . 
  in economic matters it 's reasonable , but in culture and immigration ... 
  this place has a closer mentality to a small conservative provincial town than young people in cities . 
  no way in hell assad is worse than isis . 
  he is just power hungry , if he has power he is not gon na threaten anyone . 
  until recently he as friendly with the west and in top of this he 's one of the most secular leaders in the region . 
  bottom line - assad can be acceptable in a concert of nations at the un . 
  isis on the other hand will never be acceptable or accepted . 
  wherever there is isis there will be war . 
  even if they defeat all their enemies they will push for some hardcore totalitarian islam . 
  isis wants to expand its borders , assad no . 
  isis does terrorist attacks around the world , assad no . 
  really it 's very surprising for me you can say assad is as bad as isis . 
  yes there are 10 million things wrong with him and he is a brutal dictator , but the sad thing our world is so fucked up that compare to isis this guy is like pope francis . 
  irak military that fled when isis attacked ? 
  the functioning military there are shia militias backed by iran . 
  if assad falls the strongest opposition is freaking isis . . 
  i prefer assad 8 days of the week . 
  just trying to be informed here - so the political rally that was bombed had both ethnic turks and kurds ? 
  kurds are majoritarily left wing right ? 
  what about these tribal kurdish leaders ? 
  arent they kurdish nationalists too ? 
  what does this even mean ? 
  credit on being honest, 
  because we have maghrebins as class mates , teachers , neighbours , football team mates , woman selling you mcdonalds , girl you meet in a club , guy sitting next to you in the stadium etc etc. 
  they are not some exotic people that are impossible to decipher . 
  you know if you have some maghrebin friends ( which im guessing you probably dont . . ) you can just ask him/her - `` hey whats your opinion on this ? '', 
  and no the person wont declare a fatwa on you . 
  i feel like many europeans in reddit live in some very all white gated communities and the only arabs they see is on tv or when they happen to go to the wrong part of town so they get all these sensationalist ideas . 
   that was just elite policy . 
  as the two chechen wars proved , it was not universally gotten behind . 
  which happened after the fall of the ussr . 
  ussr was against religion and especially nationalism ( apart from russian nationalism obviously ) . 
  thats why religious miniorities were persecuted , not necessarily because they wanted to promote the orthodox christianity , but because they didnt want people to overstate their identities . 
  we have to remember ussr was the biggest country in the world with a huge amount of nationalities yet very centralized . 
  i thought muslims are allowed to have 4 wives anyways, 
   i do have to say this is just showing how we do n't understand the arabs and they do n't understand us , even after many years . 
  talk for yourself, 
  in france the country is split between west and east . 
  western france is more left wing , while eastern france is more conservative . 
  the most leftwing area of france is the southwest while the most right wing is the south east . 
  here is a map of votes in the first round of the 2012 elections - http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/2012_french_presidential_election_-_first_round_-_majority_vote_%28metropolitan_france%2c_communes%29.svg/640px-2012_french_presidential_election_-_first_round_-_majority_vote_%28metropolitan_france%2c_communes%29.svg.png ( blue - ump ( centre right ) , pink - ps ( centre left ) , brown fn ( far right ) , red fdg ( far left ) ) the southwest has some history of being a left wing area . 
  during world war 2 a lot of the maquis of the french resistance were over there ( helped by the terrain ) . 
  more recently the larzac movement there was the start of anti-globalism movements world wide http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fight_for_the_larzac . 
  the area is also relatively rural with little immigration . 
  as for the southeast it has received a lot of immigration from north africa throughout the years from the big ports of marseille and toulon . 
  after the algerian war 100,000 s of pieds noirs ( europeans living in algeria ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pied-noir resettled there aswell as indegenous arabs . 
  before that italian immigrants often times had frictions with the local community aswell . 
  today the south east has some pockets of very high wealth due to tourism opportunites and real estate around some cities such as cannes , nice , st tropez , monaco etc , but also poverty . 
  marseille , france 's 2nd biggest city is an example of this , since the deindustrialization the port city has become much poorer and is extremely multicultural with high percentages of people with north african , italian , spanish , armenian , comorian , senegalese etc backgrounds . 
  in general the eastern part of france has received more immigration and has more urban centres than the west which has rural zones . 
  i stumbled upon this old french rap song ( from 1999 ) and i thought it might interest / r/europe . 
  it gives a good perspective and explains the life of north and sub saharan migrants in french banlieus . 
  the music video gives some good insight into french banlieus communites , and the lyrics really lay it out .
