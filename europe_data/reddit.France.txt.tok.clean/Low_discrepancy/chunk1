box in vasque , street in georgian those are two very different meanings , arent they ? 
  we are truly sons of roma invicta . 
  kale for street also seems to be a loan word from latin too : callis . 
  not surprising though . 
   chechen and basque languages have some connection ... 
  they have a common word for terrorism ? 
   oh god , great . 
  welcome back , stasi , how we missed you . 
  were n't these laws known before ? 
  are people surprised germany has hate speech laws ? 
  also stasi would bug your house and make a file on you . 
  if you post it online for people to see ... that is n't the same thing . 
   upstate new york albania ? 
   suppose i murdered your mother and will always deny i even knew or met her . 
  so due to my continual denials the judge will say the thing here is `` might is right '' . 
  while more info is much better than less for the people who suffered , it still does n't mean much will change * at this moment in time * . 
  for history reasons it is good to know and we all know at some point in the future russia will have to say the truth , so these things are good . 
  but for tomorrow , neah , same old same old . 
   they got killed for believing something again , they got killed cuz they had aks in their hand and had to be stopped . 
  salah abdeslam also planned to kill people and he 's not dead . 
   there is no reason why you could n't be martyr and be doing something illegal at the same time that can arguable happen is say you 're a neo nazi and you get sent to jail cuz you had nazi symbols or whatever . 
  technically they did n't harm anyone but as a society we decided nazis = no no . 
  but that is not the case here . 
  they either kamikazed or they had aks . 
   being put to death here 's your main thing . 
  a kamikaze is n't put to death . 
  a kamikaze commits suicide . 
  you can not conflate kamikaze with someone killed for their beliefs . 
  that 's stupid . 
   one who sacrifices his or her life , station , or something of great personal value , for the sake of principle or to sustain a cause . 
  well they were not killed because of what they believed in ( for example the tons of terrorists that were caught and not sentenced to death ) . 
  they are not martyrs they are simply individuals that either committed illegals acts and the police had to stop them from committing those acts . 
   if someone goes and gets killed doing anything they think fuck me some people do n't bother reading . 
  again , the kouachi brothers were ** not killed ** for what they believed . 
  they were killed because they had aks and planned to kill other people . 
  if i attack you with a gun and you kill me , i do n't become a martyr because the only thing you did was defend yourself . 
  you can replace turkish with any other nationality on this globe , safe for qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and walloons and my comment would be the same . 
  you are free to downvote and move on . 
  reddit 's all about form and not function . 
  it 's because we compete in stinky cheese is n't it ? 
   because communication between people is not binary scientific communication has to be as clear as possible with as little ambiguity as possible . 
  this leaves for a dry ** but ** effective language and communication . 
   you can also think of it how well can artist communicate his views , and lead good discussion is how good his art is then say you have a friggin morbid curiosity related to some fucking retards and stop painting it as `` oh i just want to prevent things '' . 
  are you a psychologist ? 
   so maybe some artist will go to psychologist to work with them on this work why add different layers to the information you may want to obtain instead of going direct to the source . 
  would you like to recieve an operation from a guy that is friends with a surgeon or from someone that is an actual surgeon . 
  do you read your news on buzzfeed or do you go to the source ? 
  do you learn history by watching game of thrones , or hollywood movies ? 
  do you drink fanta if you 're in the mood of an orange ? 
  art is art . 
  science is science . 
  do not mix them since they serve different goals . 
  an artist can speak shit , a psychologist if she speaks shit , she might get fired etc etc etc. 
  i simply think france has sufficient issues at hand and sufficient integration problems . 
  i do n't want to add a whole new population to the mix . 
  i also believe mass immigration is a bad thing . 
   i am most interested in not having future victims then go talk to a friggin ** psychologist ** that is an expert on radicalisation . 
  not some art galery . 
  because artist = / = psychologist . 
   technically i am a free person so why should i follow the law if i dont consider juristiction a thing . 
  / r/amibeingdetained, 
   while this is true , how is it true . 
  a martyr is a passive person persecuted for their beliefs . 
  if i kill myself i am not a martyr i am a kamikaze , i am a person that committed suicide etc. 
  if i kill people on the street and in order to stop me , you kill me , i do not become a victim because you killed me not for my beliefs but because i was killing other people . 
  fuck me , if you are deranged you can call them soldiers , but in no shape or form are they martyrs because that 's not the definition of the word . 
   positive connotation , oppressor , injustice and innocence are relative . 
  kamikazes and people shot because they kill others are ** not ** fucking martyrs because like / u/tuesias said a martyr is someone passive . 
  it is done to you and it is ** for ideological reasons ** . 
  they were either kamikazes so they chose to die or they were shot because ** of their actions not their beliefs ** . 
  action being carrying an ak and shooting people . 
  a martyr ( greek : \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2 , m\u00e1rtys , `` witness '' ; stem \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1 - , m\u00e1rtyr - ) is somebody who suffers persecution and death for advocating , renouncing , refusing to renounce , or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party . 
  if you kill yourself , you 're not a fucking martyr since being a martyr implies someone killing you . 
  a kamikaze is n't a martyr unless words have no meaning for you . 
  and those ones getting shot are n't martyrs since they were ** not ** killed for their beliefs but because they did n't surrender and were carrying aks . 
   i am personally very interested in individual stories of these people , i want to understand where they came from , how they grew up , how they were influenced by politics in countries in which they lived and how they ended up radicalised , so i can do better decision when voting for politics with different policies in mind to combat terrorism . 
  why are n't you interested in the victims ? 
  that 's our society nowadays . 
  you are a sick bastard : omg you 're so interested . 
  you got fucked up by a sick bastard : meh who cares tell me more about the deranged individual . 
  well it depends on the law of each country . 
  if it goes with danish law fine . 
  in france it would be considered apology of terrorism and would be illegal . 
  depends on the law of every country . 
  i ca n't parade a swastika in germany , insult jews and shout it 's art guys ... 
   then why are n't we seeing a huge influx of romanians trying to come to germany ? 
  because they went to spain and italy . 
  probably related to language reasons . 
  you have your fair share of polish . 
  again 1.5 million romanians left in 7 years . 
  for a country of 20 million that is ** a lot ** . 
  i 'm against isis not against refugees . 
   marselie frogie . 
  dude at least my education system taught me how to spell ... 
  what friggin advantage ? 
  dude ugh . 
  french plans were defensive . 
  that 's why we built the friggin maginot line . 
  the winter froze the western front . 
   if you would strike while majority of forces were in poland , war would end much sooner .
