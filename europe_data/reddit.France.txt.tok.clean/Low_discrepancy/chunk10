  what fine did they get ? 
  900 million . 
  how many people died from the vw problem ? 
  and we had to come free you from the brits . 
  stop bitching , it 's sad . 
  neah man . 
  like always us penalties are high to eu stuff and vice versa . 
  in the end the consumer , be she american or european , gets fucked . 
  long live patriotism hurrah . 
  edit : what 's with the salt ? 
  look at the gm ignition key scandal that killed 120 people . 
  they knew of the problem but did n't do shit . 
  they got fined 900 million . 
   this is all great theatre to keep the population entertained , to hide our politicians impotence - they smack some faceless us megacorp because that makes them look good , even if it will hurt everyone in the long run . 
   ) do you flip burgers at micky d ? 
  we 'll survive if micky d has to pay the fine . 
  wo n't hurt me too much . 
  actually wo n't hurt me at all . 
  do n't get testy , 
   this clearly is not describing transactions between companies on the same level . 
  you are free to call the fisc and ask them why they fined micky d  the law exists . 
  do n't move the goal post . 
  like it or not , a lot of french islamists became radicalised in prison . 
  put a lot of people together in forced cohabitation and some crazies and great things ** wo n't ** happen . 
   before we trusted it you should n't trust people , especially foreign politicians . 
   if you said a little more , you might leave us informed fn has become a party that is essentially split in two since marine came to power . 
  historically it was the party that is claimed . 
  people that opposed algeria being given independence . 
  after algeria got what it wanted , the former colonialists/french that lived in algeria ( what we 'd call pieds noirs ) had to return home and moved to the south . 
  they resented having had to leave so they voted fn massively . 
  they were traditionally anti-muslim , anti-jewish , catered for catholics , for not exactly poor people . 
  now that mlp got in power , she changed the party to a more dilluted version . 
  more social aspects in her program , a speech based on republicanism ( i.e. 
  you 're french if you have french citizenship regardless of your religion as long as you keep it to yourself ( the french way ) ) , she 's dropping the catholic references ( no longer marches on jeanne d'arc 's day ) , towards the gay marriage issue : she never protested against the law , she never complained about it , and well the second guy in power at the fn and her right hand man is a gay dude and the leader of the french jewish council said mlp is irreproachable but the party still is n't democratic . 
  she is still for national preference , anti-eu , anti-islamisation . 
  so the division : marine le pen is popular in the north but the old school fn represented by marion is popular in the south . 
  she is bigger than her party in many ways and her main issue is old people do n't really vote for her since she wants us to get out of the eu and euro . 
  she still needs to make changes and become less radical . 
  but honestly i think there 's hardly any difference between marine le pen ( and her clique ) and farange . 
  you do n't understand french politics . 
  i 'll just say that . 
  yes i got that . 
  my question is : * what specific law * ? 
  i want someone to point me to a text that describes what 's the minimum human interaction an inmate should have . 
  and what must that interaction include . 
  i doubt such a thing exists , meaning the whole case was judged by someone based on opinion . 
  `` humane treatment '' so the concept `` the law is the law '' is kinda tautological and not universal since based on the opinion of the judge . 
  you forgot : he gets to preach to other nutters around him creating a caustic environment . 
   the universal declaration of human rights of 1948 regulate they do n't regulate anything since they 're not law . 
   the law is the law . 
  but is there a law saying inmates must have x amount of hours of human contact per day ? 
  and a law that defines what human contact is ? 
   i always wondered why french move to england . 
  because they can . 
  in this case a lot move to london because of the financial sector . 
  and they do well . 
  http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/13/these-universities-produce-the-highest-paid-graduates-in-european-finance/ 6 out of the top 10 are from france . 
  but no , uk is n't the top destination . 
  switzerland i think is . 
  not a lot of french leave france though . 
  5 % of the population . 
   until i heard about farage and start maturing . 
  huh ? 
  do n't worry / u/rc72 i 've got this . 
   which law makes it illegal to make a bad deal with a foreign company ( = overbilling ) there are laws against price gouging for example https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/cpd/price-gouging and against over billing https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do?cidtexte=legitext000006069577&amp;idarticle=legiarti000006307749&amp;datetexte=&amp;categorielien=cid futher reinforced here http://www.senat.fr/leg/ppl12-726.html enjoy yourself buddy . 
   did i said i 'm romanian ? 
  wtf ? 
  must everything be about you ? 
  you insert yourself in a conversation then you turn everything about you ? 
  are you looking for reasons to be offended ? 
  and do n't worry . 
  unless you 're gypsy , people of your ethnicity killed jews during that period in that region . 
   i have absolutely nothing to do with it . 
  did i say that ? 
   how many of us died by the fascists hands too well like it or not quite a significant part of those fascists were romanians . 
  and unlike communism that was imposed by the outside , the fascists did their job with great conviction without any outside influence or help . 
  neah the fascists did n't . 
  that 's why they went about killing a ton of people . 
  let 's not forget the iasi pogrom that saw 13000 jewish killed in 2 days . 
  meaning business as usual . 
   you claimed to speak for `` all europeans '' and you are not . 
  nope . 
   there wo n't be a public vote on the issue . 
  contrary to france , our politicians are in favor of it . 
  always happy to hear germans pushing for less democracy . 
  what happened last when only 40 % of people where in favor of something ? 
  more like [ ariel castro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ariel_castro_kidnappings ) because fritzl was at least related to the kid . 
   it seems like all other states in that union are in favor of it , your point being ? 
  well the thing is ... it has to be unanimous . 
  sucks does n't it ? 
   pretty much every other country in europe is in favor yeah you 're right . 
  pretty much every country is in favor . 
  you know who 's the most against : http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/ here 's a hint : they each started a world war ... can you guess ? 
  your point being ? 
  if you do n't like it , start your own union buddy . 
  there are probably about 300k french in the uk http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26823489 out of 65 million people . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_the_united_kingdom about 700k polish in the uk . 
  out of 38 million . 
  i hope you can spot the difference . 
  and a lot are well qualified so they do n't risk much if uk leaves ( they 'll dump all french traders ?
