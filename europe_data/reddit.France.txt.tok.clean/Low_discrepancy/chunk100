  but freedom of movement is ** not ** schengen . 
  your average `` kowalski '' can go visit his cousin in the uk . 
  yet the uk is not in schengen ... 
  seems more like a problem of educamalation is the problem . 
  or did i understand it wrong ? 
  well it looks like you 're making your own schengen . 
  that 's good . 
  well uk is n't crumbling under . 
  they have a steady economy . 
  heck a terrorist strike like the one the nutjob in the thalys train wanted to cause would never happen in the eurostar . 
  i 'm frankly against schengen . 
  there 's no security to it at all . 
   not the biggest one . 
  id think freedom of movement , freedom of trade , freedom of employment outclass schengen in terms of eu benefits . 
  with the current situation in the eu and right govt in poland , wouldnt polish people want more border control ? 
  why ? 
  i 'm genuinly curious ? 
  what 's the problem with showing your passport when you cross the border ? 
   do you deny that declaring war on terrorism is like declaring war on drugs , something that is pleasing to the ear , but ultimately unwinnable in the sense of a classical war ? 
  against al qaeda nope . 
  with isis yes . 
  they want their state , they have a currency pegged on the value of gold , they raise taxes , they have exports and trades . 
  they 're a state and like every state they can be destroyed . 
   do you disagree that a major reason for declaring such wars is so that you can maintain for longer or indeterminately a state of emergency while seeming legitimate ? 
  the war ** has ** to happen . 
  isis is killing people in syria . 
  so is assad . 
  the syria issue must be solved . 
   do you deny the existence of the position of the roman dictator and the emergency powers granted to it during times of need ? 
  and how is it relevant to the issue ? 
  does france have the same constitution as the roman empire ? 
  mkay . 
   one for 19 years in algeria yeah algeria was going through a civil war that spilled over . 
  it lasted 11 years and between 50k - 150k people died . 
  in a country of 40 million , that 's a friggin lot . 
   the processes i have pointed to are present in society . 
  none of this is false they are not false , nor are they relevant . 
  this convo is going all over the place . 
  we 'll agree to disagree . 
  i wonder if serbians really want to join the eu . 
  i have a friend here doing a phd financed from french institutions . 
  arrived in france with erasmus type programs that were put forth by the eu , but she is still against serbia joining the eu . 
  when i asked why , she gave me some weird reason like serbia would have to take a lot of loans and debt will rise . 
  she enjoys a western country but apparently is cool with denying other fellow serbians that pleasure too . 
  i think a lot of people are illiterate about the eu and what it is yet they still have strong feelings . 
  falciani is shaddy as f. and he 's the most obnoxious person ever . 
  you mean in the us , the police can perform searches in homes and cars without warrants ? 
  cuz thats how these searches are performed right now :  boss can i search this guy 's home ? 
   be my guest . 
  you mean in the us , it is illegal to have public gatherings ? 
  and the police can perform house arrests without any judge having to give his opinion ? 
  til . 
   still , prolonged states of emergency becoming the norm are not a new thing by any means . 
  honestly , this does my head in . 
  even if what we have now is the same name with what other countries have , that does n't mean it 's the same thing . 
  state of emergency is very similar in france to a state of war . 
  that 's why and how it was created . 
  to make a new thing , you 'd need to change the constitution . 
  uhm , people keep forgetting france also has a consitutional court which checks if the laws are constitutional . 
  the parlament can vote any laws they want , they can not be stopped . 
  but that does n't mean those laws will continue . 
  and considering that we already have protests against the current state of emergency , imagine if it extended with no limit . 
  most likely the state of emergency will continue for 6 months at least . 
  i dont think it 's the same thing . 
  france is basically a police state during the state of emergency . 
   well , the west could n't stop sucking erdo\u011fan 's dick about what a moderate , so it 's europe 's fault he got elected ? 
  i 'm starting to think that if we remove europe , the us and israel from the world , nothing would ever happen . 
   please explain to me how the first group is `` much better '' than the latter . 
  uhm . 
  gay marriage ? 
  germany still doesnt recognise it . 
  not does switzerland . 
  lets take your secular states list : 3/4 . 
  well that aint bad . 
  that aint bad at all . 
   this line of thought is completely flawed , because it assumes that all theists are idiots , and atheists are somehow the enlightened ones , based on something that nobody will ever be able to prove . 
  it 's called having a belief for a reason . 
  based on simple religious beliefs , yes being an atheist is better than being a theist . 
  you consider : oh but what is the atheist is a rapist and the theist donates to charity . 
  that 's not the topic . 
  the question is : is a random atheist a more rational person than a random theist . 
  imho yes . 
  is beign more rational better ? 
  yes . 
  we 'll agree to disagree and end the convo here cuz its a pointless one to carry . 
   you 're still number three nope . 
  that would be sweden . 
  if you check this sauce . 
   http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html  otoh the socio-economic status of turkish germans did n't start out any better . 
  well you should understand that isis is an arab sunnite creation . 
  the turkish are well turks . 
  they have little connection with the rest . 
  check that sauce again . 
  turkey has about 6 fighters per million . 
  germany has 8 . 
  so germany is actually a worse than turkey . 
  but hey nuances and details and facts arent important . 
  you have your ideology : poor subjugated muslims go fight for isis . 
  i too expect that . 
  i do want those elsasser to get with the rest of france and dump silly laws .
