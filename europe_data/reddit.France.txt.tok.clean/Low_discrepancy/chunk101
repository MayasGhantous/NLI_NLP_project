   secular government is n't an inherently good thing all things considered equal , a secular govt is better than a theist one . 
  much better . 
  and an atheist person tells me at least they dont believe in a big bearded guy living in the skies coordinating everything . 
   who cares that it has been in place for a century , if it turns out it does n't work ? 
  look at [ this poll ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2006/07/06/muslims-in-europe-economic-worries-top-concerns-about-religious-and-cultural-identity/?utm_expid=53098246-2.lly4cfsvqg2lphsg-kopig.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.fr ) . 
  7 % of british muslims feel first british . 
  42 % of muslim french feel first that they are french . 
  13 % for germany . 
  for christians it 's : * 48 % us * 59 % uk , germany * 83 % france the system is not working ? 
  are you sure ? 
  here you go . 
  nice is a hotspot . 
  ariane , drap , la trinit\u00e9 are kinda shitty areas ( which is weird because the landscape is gorgeous , but they decided to build friggin ghettoes . ), 
  the day they 'll decide to tear down the ghettos across france will be a glorious day . 
  like i said that 's the only specific case . 
  see the alsace-moselle concordat . 
  protestants . 
  what do you expect ? 
  yup . 
  it has very well . 
  belgium and denmark see more isis fighters per capita than france . 
  france simply has the largest population muslim population . 
  i know it 's hard to believe , but considering the circumstances , the system ** does ** work . 
  yes . 
  and france does n't recognise any religious organisation . 
  it doesnt finance any ( to be checked in meurthe-et-moselle ) . 
  yup . 
  lets change our model that has been in place for 100 years , that created one of the most secular societies in the western world and one with the largest number of atheists ( fuck yeah ) because 400 shit heads fighting for some retarded reasons that are not even connected to religion . 
  that makes sense . 
  while i think that corbyn is in the wrong here . 
  unlike al qaeda , is works like a state . 
  they established a currency and international trade . 
  they raised taxes . 
  they want a caliphate . 
  therefore they are not a diffusive threat . 
  they are a direct threat and they look for the conflict . 
  i believe a war with them would be much more efficient because it would result in the type of war the west knows how to do best : to armies facing one another . 
  ** but ** goddamn . 
  corbyn 's just being the classical extreme leftist . 
  all wars are wrong for them ( except those that aim to bring communism to power ) . 
  labelling him a terrorist sympathiser is just so silly . 
  yeyy . 
  go wahhabism in bosnia and kosovo !, 
  thats the chant we 're taught in schools . 
  yeah . 
  everybody 's now an expert on terrorism , religion , extremism and country policies, 
  yeah . 
  you think these terrorists give a shit about normal preachers ? 
  a lot of these terrorists were either radicalised in jail and almost all had very little connection with mainstream islam . 
   ( have seen rufed too you 've seen someone being roofied ? 
  i hope you called the cops . 
  rf 2 letters + another comment needing to explain it . 
  huh . 
  who knew abbreviations could be so useful, 
  i can not remember the last time i 've had to bribe myself at the doctor . 
  can not remember the last time i gave a gift to professors for leniency on grading . 
  and while eads was involved in shitty business , so was bechtel and i can not remember they standing trial . 
  overall rf is less corrupt than ee . 
  radio frequency ? 
  are you saying the corruption levels in the 90s ee is the same or worse compared to today ? 
  that ditching is done because the eu is giving those countries a carrot : mo money for less corruption . 
  it 's a state of emergency and during states of emergency protests are not allowed . 
  again : during states of emergency , france is technically a police state . 
  while terrorists are disgusting scum , not all palestinians are terrorists . 
  for many people out there , a two state solution seems like the way to go . 
  cinema physics . 
  sound and blast reaches before the light . 
  heck i 'm a dual national too . 
  but mine 's classier than algeria . 
  i should check the law . 
  but now in france if you get jail under a certain amount of months , you immediatly get probation . 
  if it 's under 5 years and for robbery , breaking and entering , non-violent crimes etc , it 's highly likely you 'll get a probation  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/loi_relative_%c3%a0_l'individualisation_des_peines_et_renfor%c3%a7ant_l'efficacit%c3%a9_des_sanctions_p%c3%a9nales called containte penale . 
   if people broke into your home and started sleeping on the couch , if they need a place to be safe and not to harm me , i dont agree with sending them to jail . 
  it would be pointless . 
  and yes , i know friends that had people that had break-ins in their homes and think like me . 
  the meter . 
  you 're welcome . 
  you can not remove citizenship from those that have only the french one . 
  we 're not nazis . 
   lots to do , but for france to make it illegal to go to syria only depend on france and would be a first step , and one with practical consequences . 
  i personally agree with such a measure . 
  :d i burst laughing at work . 
  damn you . 
  erdogan will make me lose my job . 
  like every diktator , he just gives the orders and lets others to apply them . 
  to the country of their second ( but now unique ) citizenship . 
   and automatically arrest them upon re-entry considering that we have open borders , we dont know when they enter . 
  we 'd have to make a big database and give access to it to countries at the border . 
  revoked nationality means we can deport them . 
  we dont want to spend the energy to correct their evil ways . 
  honestly , i think it 's a good idea . 
  it would have to be something big to put them in prison . 
  revoking is much simpler and allows to do it for less serious situations . 
  prisons are already over crowded . 
  sending to jail people who tresspass or enter lorries would be silly imho . 
  they are n't doing something actually bad . 
  cases of assault are different . 
  not for the migrants . 
  for the people that are supposed to not leave french soil . 
  yeah ... hippies .
