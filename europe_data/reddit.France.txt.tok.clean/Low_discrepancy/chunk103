  and my guess that it went from the turkish word to the romanian version because relations between romania and turkey ( ottoman empire ) were n't very cordial . 
   agriculture implement came to signify penis , a wood remain became human genital hair ( yes , most are related to genitalia and sex ) . 
  that 's standard . 
  * hon hon *, 
  same in france . 
  fun fact : rahat in romanian means shit . 
  i 'm guessing it 's because romania and turkey had very cordial relations . 
  what was n't cool was the fact thet they basically destroyed the flowers and the candles put in place for the terrorist strike memorial . 
  the place where the protests happened were like 300m from the bataclan . 
  it 's more common to say plussoyer . 
   sounds like france needs to learn a thing or two from portugal . 
  indeed , and portugal can learn how not to be a poor country . 
  is that a fawlty towers reference ? 
  my man , my man . 
  yeah . 
  he 's getting karma points on reddit . 
  trully a winner . 
   cant trust any media source including reddit . 
  reddit 's nothing more than a soapbox . 
   no , a nunber of news outlets have reported it . 
  well give a sauce . 
   the most concrete info i have is from our pm interview right before the meeting an unbiased source . 
  the day i trust politicians to give me the news is the day i move into a cave or under a rock, 
  what rumors ? 
  you know somebody that knows somzbody that knows merkel ? 
  well you have to make a difference between a newspaper making stupid statements and a head of state ( pm in this case ) bursting an aneurism and starting bashing france . 
  dude . 
  i 'm no pm.i can speak whatever shit i want . 
  fun fact . 
  denmark and belgium send more jihadists per capita than france . 
  denmark get your shit together you lil european rednecks . 
  yeah . 
  the dude 's on his personal crusade . 
  hurrah !, 
  are you a flemish speaker ? 
  he did n't bash belgium . 
   france should get their shit together said the portuguese . 
  impossible to say . 
  she got about 17 % the last time , so it 'll be more . 
  probably around 30 % . 
  god seeing that retard trying to imitate a normal person made me cringe . 
  not much actually . 
  you can not give tax benefits left and right because you say so . 
  if netherlands disagrees , well nobody forces netherlands to be in the eu . 
   like direct state aid to airbus through low interest loans and tax cuts . 
  true . 
  lets see where airbus has its hq . 
  well airbus is owned by airbus group ... oh look at that netherlands . 
  how about we let them pay their fair share . 
  did i read this correctly ? 
  the dutc govt is fighting to ** not ** collect money ? 
  i should move to the netherlands . 
  those people are so polite , they wont even take your tax money . 
  ixelles , etterbeek , uccle . 
  not that special . 
  really ? 
  it was 2007 so no big games . 
  just at times , every 200-300 meters in ixelles someone would have a flag . 
  so odd . 
  i was explained that it was because people wanted to show that belgian patriotism is real . 
  do you still hand flags on the window ? 
  i was studying at ulb for a few months . 
  first time in my life that i 've seen people hanging flags at the window without it being a national holiday . 
  the whores, 
  the journey of a 1000 miles starts with 1 step . 
  or smth like that . 
  once they realise their society has n't crumbled because of the gays , they 'll maybe improve . 
  way to miss a point . 
  it 's like that was your goal . 
   geopolitical nice gesture uhm ... 
  i think we 're reading a bit too much in this story . 
  i dont know about you , but i 'm on the fence on who 's worse . 
  we should vote on it . 
  what did the flemish cat say : can i haz independentz ? 
  more like those sweet sweet arms deals . 
  10 billion . 
  go to an animal shelter and every time some adopts a dog , write a story . 
   he was responsible as a leader . 
  so kinda like how stalin was responsible for the death of several million ukrainians . 
  and that he could n't have ignored the famine happening in his country . 
  cool . 
  we reached a conclusion . 
  and do people have ownership deeds on these ? 
   you just need enough witnesses , traces and records okay . 
  then give me a witness , trace and record that says that hitler knew of the holocaust . 
   kolkhoz is a ** voluntary ** cooperative of ex-individual farmers yeah ... that 's why they disappeared after 1991 . 
  cuz they were `` voluntary '' . 
   if you are going to kill so many people history work is to record it . 
  yes . 
  i can see stalin writting down : `` dear diary , today i 'm planning to kill 100k ukrainian peasants . '', 
   if you do n't record it you are not doing history but propaganda , maybe you should use proper wording . 
  find me proof nixon ordered the watergate taps . 
  if you plan to do something evil , you do n't exactly leave a paper trail do you because `` guys we 're writing history here '' find me proof hitler knew about the holocaust . 
  that 's right ... good luck with that . 
   the problem was only cooperatives had fund to purchase them goddamit . 
  do n't you understant the kolkhoz had no money ? 
  l  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivization_in_the_soviet_union look at the damn data : 1929 : 7 % of the agricultural land in collectives , 1933 : 83 % . 
  imagine a village has 10 farmers . 
  you steal their land and all their products and supplies . 
  they do n't become by magic rich in 4 years .
