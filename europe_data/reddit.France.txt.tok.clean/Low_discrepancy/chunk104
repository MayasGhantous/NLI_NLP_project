  and surprise surprise they can not work the land because who owns what and where ? 
  where do the produces go ? 
  if you poor together 10 poor people you do n't obtain by magic 1 rich person . 
  exactly . 
  that 's how those people that want irrefutable proof act . 
  they set the bar impossibly high without analysing ** all ** the available information . 
  they want a silver bullet . 
  a video of stalin saying : `` we did it ! '', 
  and anything short of that is worthless . 
   absence of evidence is not evidence of absence !, 
   cooperatives had tractors , irrigation systems , pumps , mills ... 
  individual farmers used ploughs yeah in 1933 , ukrainian farmers all had that . 
  how much vodka did you put in the cool aid that you 're drinking ? 
  because the communists built them in 2 years . 
  i. . . i just can not reply to this . 
  too much denial for me and inaccurate history . 
  to think the communists built irrigation systems , mills , pumps then take the land from the farmers . 
  wow . 
  is that what they taught you in history class ? 
  no wonder you russians think you were the good guys . 
   just a brit who 's looking at the undecisice evidence or lack thereof to support the title 's claim do you also want a letter from bush saying he lied about wmds ? 
  and one from nixon saying he 's a crook ? 
  history is written by victors and stalin was undoubtedly victorious . 
  he had enough time to hide and trails . 
  his reign lasted 20 years more after this famine . 
  he had full control of archives , news papers etc. 
  and people who followed were n't exactly keen on admitting fault , were they ? 
  duuuude . 
  :d god you 're funny . 
   since cooperatives were much more effective than individual farmers -- the fee was pretty high for them . 
  well here 's the thing . 
  the coops at first ( and i doubt even after ) were ** not at all productive ** . 
  it was a disruptive , retarded process . 
  all supply lines that brought food from the country side to the cities were eliminated . 
  and food was taken out of the country . 
  saying it was n't a man-made famine is so stupid . 
  every country that had to go through colectivisation suffered famines . 
  what 's nation states ? 
   these groups are by and large bad news ; some of them , such as le pen and orban , are very bad indeed . 
  they agreed with some parts but overall they consider them bad news . 
  what 's so strange ? 
  le pen wants to get france out of the eu , get it out of the eurozone , her niece wants to stop finance going to human rights financing ( lgbt groups ) etc etc. 
  they obviously would be very bad news and also wont win . 
  she 'd have to go against sarkozy and the french left voters will do a 2002 again . 
  * `` numbers are fragiles beings . 
  torture them enough and they 'll confess to whatever you want them to say '' - alfred sauvy * i wonder who came up with the quote first . 
  alfred sauvy coined the term thirld world . 
  edit : seems that sauvy might have priority . 
  his citation is dated from an article in 1970 : la mythologie de notre temps . 
  http://www.bribes.org/statisti.htm the earliest by coarse seems to be 1977 : http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/if_you_torture_the_data_long_enough_it_will_confess, 
  what 's wrong with kebabs ? 
  they 're delicious . 
  the tragedy here that a once rich country is n't as rich . 
  that the kids will be poorer than the parents . 
  the relative poverty is shocking . 
  but in absolute terms , other eu countries have it worse . 
  should we tackle absolute poverty issues or relative poverty ones ? 
  on the other hand , the eu handled the whole thing the worst possible way indeed . 
  it was a contest to see who can drop the ball the hardest, 
  romania north eastern areas . 
  heck look at the state of their public transportation : http://ymtram.mashke.org/romania/vaslui/1en.html and no , the shitty villages are just the gypsy ones . 
   it 's not the greeks ' fault maybe you mean it 's not * only * the greeks ' fault . 
  poverty in the eu is n't a new story . 
  go to some shittier regions of ee and you 'll find people still building houses from mud and straws not have any running water , plumbing or waste disposal systems , still work the land with oxen or hourses etc. 
  so basically the ban applies only if those people wan na go on vacation in europe . 
  wow , guys we 're being too harsh here ... 
  considering that post austerity greece has higher debt than pre-austerity ... maybe it 's time to think a bit . 
   the best decision my parents made in life i 'm sure for you  let 's have a baby was also fairly important . 
  that 's why renewing the leadership is also good at times . 
  if not , the leaders become complacent . 
  they think they 're untouchable . 
  maybe we can arrive to an amicable agreement . 
  how about we give you nord-pas-de-calais ? 
  you can have'em . 
  deal ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ backsies, 
  well belgian values are close to french ones so i am comfortable being under the kingdom 's umbrella . 
  why is it in netherlands if it 's called vlaanderen ? 
   a week ago crimean tatar activists completely disrupted power supply to crimea demanding to free their comrades jailed by new crimean authorities , causing massive blackouts . 
  the bombing of pylons ? 
  that was done by ukranian nationalists . 
   going to have a repercussion with voters you mean more people will vote for erdogan ? 
  i doubt anyone cares either way :p, 
   only problem is that the video is in czech neah . 
  it 's only fitting . 
  often people pirate because it 's easier than getting legal content . 
  this legal content is in czech , i 'll wait for the pirated one . 
  one day turkey arrests is people . 
  the other they send guns to terrorists . 
  i dont understand squat, 
  i 'm not france . 
  you 're not uk . 
  unless you 're cameron and have a big say in what uk will do . 
  you 're not a very good arms dealer if your arms do n't work when they 're supposed to . 
  when we disagree with someone , they 're the * other * . 
  mkay.nice argument buddy , you convinced . 
   you would be ok with these states submitting their people and foreign policy to russia against their wishes it 's sad to say , but spheres of influence exist . 
  ignoring them , saying they 're undemocratic etc etc is fine . 
  but we can not deny they exist . 
  we call them allies or whatever but they exist .
