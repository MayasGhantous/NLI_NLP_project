  there 's a reason north korea is n't getting invaded , there 's a reaso why saudi arabia gets all our favors . 
  i am not accusing nato . 
  i am accusing bush for giving georgia and ukraine a speech about joining nato that was just a pure and utter lie because no european country would think that 's a good idea . 
   many of us come from these small countries , you kremlin apologist . 
  :d  no , i 'm talking about russia , russia is acting like a regional powerhouse . 
  just like france did , just like uk did , just like the us did . 
  lets get off our moral high ground and admit in a similar situation we 'd do the same , cuz screw small countries . 
  heck we did the same . 
   many of us come from these small countries , so you 're from iran ? 
  do n't you just love the us ? 
  i am presenting the whole context . 
  we talk about georgia and ukraine , russians talk the examples i gave you . 
  we 're all big countries with big militaries . 
  we dont extend because democracy , we do it because we have our interests . 
  stop acting like omg you got so insulted . 
  it 's global politics . 
  are you talking about the bay of pigs , overthrowing guatemala 's democratically elected president , the us intervention in the chile coup that deposed the democratically elevted president , allende to install a dictator pinochet , the darling of maggie , [ 1953 iranian coup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d%27\u00e9tat ) organised by the uk and the us that saw the removal of the democratically elected leader mossadegh to put in place a dictator that tortured students . 
  the uk-france-israel occupation of the suez canal ? 
  the war in algeria , the bombing of the greenpeace boat rainbow warrior . 
  massive amounts of colonisation done by france and the uk . 
  the carpet bombing of laos and cambodia by the us ? 
  are these the :  invasion , annexation and subversion of neighbouring allied states . 
  that you mention ? 
  we and russia like to fuck with small countries . 
  we like screw them around a lot . 
  lets stop acting like virgins . 
  there 's no shame in admitting that our interests top those by other countries that have crappier armies . 
  it would just be recognizing reality . 
   considering its people 's religion when you are at work , for france , you are france . 
  you are not a muslim , a christian a whatever . 
   i personally really dislike fake blondes and would be really happy if i never saw a single one of them ever again . 
  strawman  outlawed all religion except for cultural elements of it ( religious art , architecture , clothing , folklore ) , good . 
  because the state can not finance any religious activity . 
   like how we see pagan religions of old , gods of greece and what not . 
  did you see them in a french court : o  people believe in a religion but are excepted to take it on-hold meanwhile they are working exactly . 
  what is a state . 
  it is all the people that work in public positions . 
   everyone pretends it does n't because they are n't wearing a cross or a headscarf somehow . 
  we show that for the state , france comes before religion . 
  france is more important than religion . 
   do you understand it then ? 
  well the echr gave the ruling i was expecting . 
  so we can either take your word or the word of judges that have decades of experience . 
  and i do n't understand why a judge in turley can wear a veil at work . 
  see . 
  we both can not understand something . 
  that 's bs . 
  it applies for christians and jewish and buddhists and whatever . 
  no one forces you to work for the state . 
  in the public sector , at work , you have no personal culture . 
  you 're the image of france . 
   i do n't follow their logic , then . 
  how is a ban on headscarf , religious reasons or not , part of equality ? 
  you fail to understand secularism then . 
  the state has ** no ** religion . 
  so when i go to school and look at teachers or go and pay my taxes or go in front of a judge , i dont want to see big crosses , veils , scarfs etc. 
  it is about the state being ** religion free ** . 
  the state is all the public sector workers . 
  at home you can do whatever you want . 
  in the street you can do whatever you want . 
  ** at work ( in the public sector ) you are france . 
   i 'll tell you why - because you 're trying to excuse inexcusable actions . 
  btw what are those inexcusable actions ? 
  the guy was talking of war of religions and islam . 
  i know a fuckton of muslims . 
  i dont know any that wan na kill me . 
  in romania there were protests immediatly , in poland also . 
  groups of people that fought communism were formed . 
  how can we analyse history if we do n't know all the facts ? 
   exactly . 
  so why did you try to frame it as if bush were asking for these countries to join ? 
  bush was pushing for those countries to join , regardless of what russia would think . 
  how did it turn out ? 
  yes . 
  and you can apply as much as you want . 
  that does n't mean nato will consider your application bush was very much in favor of integrating them in nato http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/01/nato.georgia  speaking in kiev after a meeting with ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko , the us president said both post-soviet ukraine and georgia should be allowed to join the alliance -- despite vehement objections from russia . 
   georgia has been moving towards nato integration since 2003 oh okay . 
  and bush was n't president in 2003 . 
  and as president of the us he was n't the most important country in nato . 
  okay . 
  i 'll take sophism , alex. 
   the us is only a threat to russia because russia decides to be a threat to others . 
  in 2008 russia was n't much of a threat . 
  then bush got the bright idea to include georgia and ukraine in nato . 
   our countries does n't control the media the iraq war was a case of controlling the media . 
  the bush administration fed the wmd story to the media directly . 
  media which never bothered to check if the stories are real . 
  our govts are responsible for spying on its citizens , are responsible for toppling democratically elected govts or invading sovereign countries . 
  ( chile , guatemala , suez canal , etc. ), 
  so then its not a religious war . 
  just an ideological one, 
  what do you associate the ps with ? 
  how about ump ? 
   kind of ` religious ' war the hell you talking about ? 
  the vast vast majority of people killed by islamist terrorist have been muslims . 
   showing a bit of our christianity lets not . 
  well that 's what happens when you live next to an elephant . 
  look at all the wars we had in western europe . 
  we were all elephants with no room for each other . 
  luckly we had africa , south america , asia to extend our dicks .
