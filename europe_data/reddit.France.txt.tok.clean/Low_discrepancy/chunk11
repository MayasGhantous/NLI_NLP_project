  not gon na happen ) . 
   but france also has a large amount of anti-eu meps considering the time period 09-15 , fn had ** 3 ** seats . 
  that means they were the 7th party from france in terms of seats . 
  in 2014 they got 24 seats becoming the largest . 
  so that should factor in your comments . 
   germany has 147 trade deals active , it has n't lowered the workers rights . 
  so there ya go . 
  we do n't need more trade deals . 
  we 're all happy with the status quo . 
   trade their countries do with the uk , whereas smaller economies such as spain and poland are more acutely aware of this . 
  trade ? 
  or workers ? 
  spain and especially poland have quite a few in the uk whereas france and germany do n't . 
  it seems it 's more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transfer_mispricing than transfer pricing . 
  abusing transfer mispricing is illegal . 
   this type of corporate structure is completely legal . 
  huh ? 
  did you read the article ? 
   l'expansion reported that it was suspected of transferring 2.2 billion euros out of the country to evade tax . 
  & nbsp ;  to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions by billing the french division excessively for use of the company brand and other services . 
  since when it overbilling or tax evasion legal ? 
  people are n't dumb you know ... 
   he moved once he realised the soviets were pretty much as bad as the nazis and the coffee shop communism so you 're saying he did n't like being sent to a work camp and was politically for anyone that would get him out of that situation ? 
  he just wanted a normal life without being persecuted ? 
  well such a great thing your family unfriended him ... 
  they made 2.2 billion in profit . 
  were taxed 9 % so 200 mil . 
  and they were fined 100 mil . 
  well yeah . 
  how could it be the roman province ? 
  it stopped existing 2000 years ago . 
  the boat is much more recent . 
  just an old redditor . 
   until he went all in with the soviets . 
  the jewish did n't really have a ton of options . 
  he had to suffer the pogrom in bucharest , sent to a forced work camp . 
  you 'd be salty too . 
  either way he moved to france in 47 so he did n't go soviet all the day . 
  died recently . 
  so the 10 % warranty only works for politicians born in romania ? 
  screw that , guys do n't buy in , the corruption of their offsprings will eat up any benefits you gained before . 
   ponta and antonescu then attempted to castrate the constitutional court via an emergency government ordinance and changed the referendum law so that the president could be impeached by 50 % +1 of votes regardless of turnover did they change the constitution ? 
  what does the law say now ? 
   he worked for ceausescu 's die anyone who was someone during communist times worked for something . 
  it was normal to do that in order to climb any ladder . 
  a moldavian taking a trip on [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rms_lusitania ), 
   who he is and how he is perceived are two very different things . 
  considering that he opened the flood gates and made the romanian passport easier to get than a visa for moldavians , he might be well liked . 
  plus it 's the moldavians that strongly oppose the union . 
  ( tons of ruskies over there still ) . 
  can we get a refund for cop\u00e9 and moscovici ? 
  in what way register ? 
  they formed because the voting was messed up being an estate voting ( so the 3rd would be at a disadvantage ) . 
  some clergy and nobles joined up with the 3rd and they formed the national assembly . 
   telling the king `` this is the body running the nation , if the nobles do n't want to turn up then i guess we 're running the country on our own '' . 
  well you still need the recognition of the king . 
   he saw the third estate as a potential ally in the whole mess and thus doubled the participation of them in the estates-general . 
  yes , at necker 's request , but the vote would still be by estate ( each estate gets 1 vote ) . 
  so they would still be in a minority . 
  they thought they 'd get more representation but the king just wanted financial reforms . 
  the 3rd estate was refused entry to a lot of general estate debates that 's why they form the national assembly where the voting would be proportional . 
  after another general estate where they were refused entry they organise the sement du jeu de paume and pledge to abolish the feudal system , declaration of human rights etc etc. 
  of course this is just at the beginning of the french revolution . 
  so saying it was all a fiscal issue does n't do it justice . 
  the fact that the 3rd estate was refused representation made the shit hit the fan . 
   which was a short cleanup of the legionnaires by the govt . 
  nope . 
  the legionnairies tried a coup d'\u00e9tat . 
  they were also backed by malaxa . 
   but that was only political suppression but also civil massacres in the case of the jewish . 
  arguably the iron guard did perform actions that could amount to a civil war . 
  the jilava massacre , the 1941 rebellion and also the massive massacres of romania 's jewish population . 
  that 's a cool analysis . 
   a nation that could tax nobody huh ? 
  everybody was taxing everybody . 
  a loaf of bread ( made with sawdust because there was n't enough wheat ) cost prior to the revolution the equivalent of 50 euros due to taxes . 
   a lot of people falsely believe the french revolution was started because middle class people wanted rights while the financial crisis was the background , the political demands was what made the french revolution a revolution . 
  without the political side ( expressed at the serment du jeu de paume ) it would n't have been such a massive change . 
  it 's not like france was going through its first financial crisis at that time . 
  i 'm lovin ' it !, 
  corrected, 
   that 's not a legal argument , or turkish nationalists would be stopped from trying to get citizenship in our societies that 's like saying that no one jaywalks because there 's a law against jaywalking . 
  just because there 's ~ ~ no ~ ~ a law , does n't mean it 's applied every time . 
  also in france they can refuse to give you citizenship for any reason and they are n't obliged to give the reason to you . 
   it was a pre planned ~ ~ attack ~ ~ accident ftfy, 
  you can include former french pm [ pierre beregovoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_b%c3%a9r%c3%a9govoy#death ) found with 2 gunshots to the head . 
  but there are n't really confirmed conspiracies . 
  confirmed conspiracies : * [ dreyfus affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dreyfus_affair ) french jewish officer is wrongly accused of espionage . 
  sentenced and sent to devil 's island in high secrecy . 
  the trial was not public . 
  it tore france in two as anti-semitism was wide spread . 
  zola wrote his famous * j'accuse * piece and had to flee france . 
  [ this is my favorite image of the scandal ] ( http://affaire-dreyfus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/degrad.bmp ) it shows dreyfus being deranked at the ecole militaire in paris . 
  he is on the left . 
  1 m in front of his you see a smudge . 
  another officer is ripping off his insignia off his uniform and breaks his sword . 
  * [ sinking of the rainbow warrior ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinking_of_the_rainbow_warrior ) greenpeace boat is sunk in new zeeland as it was ready to start protesting against french nuclear tests in polynesia . 
  one person died . 
  segolene royal 's brother was part of the commando . 
   the p2 masonic lodge was a secret masonic lodge why do you need that when you have the vatican and the mafia ?
