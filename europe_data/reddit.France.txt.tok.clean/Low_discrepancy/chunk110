   as would a lesson for the girl on how to say `` no '' . 
  do you know the definition of consent ? 
   she was asleep and he did n't realize . 
  sounds like accident . 
  so again : did ** she agree to being touched by the dude ** ? 
  then what is it ? 
   but attempting to regulate and control my sexuality would be a different thing . 
  wow . 
  you do need a safe space . 
  this is n't just your sexuality . 
  it is the sexuality of your partner as well . 
  you can do whatever you want to yourself . 
  this is about interaction with other people . 
   that 's good but you should know that 's not how universities normally do it . 
  well i dont care about universities and about how they 're doing it . 
  i am talking about what 's right . 
   she consented to the kissing , how should he know she did n't consent to the touching ? 
  well you seem like the type of person a consent class would be useful for . 
  did she verbally agree to touching ? 
  then you 're on your ow buddy . 
   should guys give out consent forms for every sexual thing they do ? 
  she did n't verbally agree did she ? 
  we are n't saying you need a form . 
  you need a verbal agreement . 
   this kind totalitarian of belittlement will become very time consuming very fast indeed . 
  i disagree . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
  have a nice day . 
   i 'm sure they know it 's rape . 
  well if you are sure , then it 's fine . 
   a class wo n't affect that , as they know which one is the right thing to do without having been told . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
  have a nice day . 
  so what 's the elgal definition of consent in your country ? 
   this statistic is thrown around a lot in feminist circles , but it is a lie , purposefully drawn from false conclusions . 
  is it 1 in 5 women on campus , your source ? 
  because nytimes says 1 in 5 women . 
  in consent classes peoples guilt is assumed by virtue of them existing . 
  says who ? 
  you ? 
   it does not take a tinfoil hat to recognise obviously anti-intellectual bullshit like ... that 's a bull shit poster that has no legal bracking  and the average age of a rapist in the us is 31 . 
  so if anything , job centers should hold the classes . 
  well that 's lovely . 
  but if you had taken a statistics class , you would have known than in the case of non-symmetric distributions , the mean does n't say a lot . 
  tell me the median or a quantile like i have shown you . 
  dont do bs stats while accusing others of bs stats . 
  we 'll agree to disagree . 
  have a nice day . 
  and even if it was an accident , ** it could have been avoided **, 
   back here the same time we get sex education the issue is talked about . 
  that 's fucking perfect . 
  this should be taught at some point in our lives . 
  saying meh i know everything there is to know , well you 'll get fucked up in life if you go by that motto . 
  it was a sexual assault too . 
  she could have pressed charges . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  what does the law in your country say ? 
   no , that 's why a consent class is an act of despicable oppression . 
  uhm . 
  you want your safe space right now ? 
   especially when you only give it to men ** all kids should be given consent classes ** is that big and bright enough for you . 
  ** everybody ** this guy and a lot of people on this thread assume that hey they know everything about consent . 
  case closed . 
  no classes . 
  sexuality is such a broad and large thing . 
  what goes for some doesnt work for others . 
  but we have a legal context . 
  at the very least we should understand that . 
  we are taught the constitution , the main aspects of democracy about society , we should be taught this minor law that is important . 
  read up this story and make your own opinion :  http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1758-5-things-i-learned-committing-campus-sexual-assault.html, 
  well read the story and form your own opinion http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1758-5-things-i-learned-committing-campus-sexual-assault.html, 
   having sex is an essential aspect of humanity yes , that 's why a consent class is important . 
  here 's an example where consent classes would have helped http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1758-5-things-i-learned-committing-campus-sexual-assault.html, 
  it 's sexual abuse . 
  the victim didnt give consent . 
   do you think it 's some charasteristic of a person with xy chromosomes to not understand what ` stop ' means ? 
  lets stop being melodramatic about this issue . 
  ** all kids ** should be taught consent classes just like ** all kids ** should be taught about birth control . 
   does n't mean we need non-murder training , if a thief comes in your house and you kill him . 
  is it legal or not ? 
  in what context ? 
  if you buy a gun that 's the type of shit you should be taught . 
   consent training is clearly a special measure that is done for special reasons . 
  that 's your bias . 
  if we assume everything in this world is done with an agenda , then we should stay indoors at all time . 
  the jews are watching us . 
   the people who do it pretend that there is a gigantic rape crisis right now . 
  maybe not a rape crisis , but 1 in 5 women declare having suffered from sexual abuse . 
   http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/health/nearly-1-in-5-women-in-us-survey-report-sexual-assault.html?_r=0  campuses are particularly safe . 
  fine . 
  dont teach it to 19 yp college students . 
  teach them to 15 yo high school ones . 
  it 's an important lesson in life . 
  it is part of sexuality and should be in sex ed classes . 
  here 's a sobbering stat   about 80 percent of rape victims reported that they had been raped before age 25 . 
   things kids instinctively know are bad , and that a minority of them do regardless . 
  so you 're telling me that if i ask a 17 year old : hey if you 're fucking someone , and mid fuck the other person wants to stop and you continue , then it 's rape . 
  then they 'll know i 'm right ? 
  do you know the legal definition of consent ? 
  what the law books in germany , italy , spain , uk say ?
