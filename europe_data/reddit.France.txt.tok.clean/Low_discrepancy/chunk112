  i 'm sure no bad could come of this . 
  let them have one step in front of putin . 
  the region is calm . 
  in the end , russia is more stable than ukraine so they can hold on after sanctions better . 
  we can therefore argue , what next ? 
  does any western nation want to invade crimea or east ukraine ? 
  i think not . 
  is it a good idea to give arms to ukranians ? 
  again no . 
  unless we want russians to openly arm the rebels . 
  woosh that went over my head . 
  but in my defence , i never played legend of zelda . 
  126 % of crimeans voted ? 
  sauces . 
   key words : `` asked spain for permission '' . 
   does that sound like a demand to you ? 
  really ? 
  that 's because they 're being diplomatic about it . 
  they being ... you know ... diplomats . 
  think of paca as the florida of france . 
  beautiful weather . 
  old french people move here for their retirement . 
  so you get things like this . 
  you realise it 's a strawman right ? 
  you cant give 14 guys a country , right ? 
  how about we let those regions have a referendum ? 
  :p i dont get that joke . 
   why should sovereign countries have to give up their land each time russia threatens them ? 
  not each time . 
  clearly the whole break-up of the soviet union was done poorly . 
  it 's not cut and dry . 
  borders are therefore expected to shift . 
  these are n't states that have centuries of fixed borders.they move about and around . 
  populations have been moved about . 
  it 's not fair but it 's reality . 
  war caused the borders of france to change . 
  why should we expect something different in another area of the world . 
  if we would recognize a referendum by scotland or catalunia , why would n't we recognise one by the inhabitants of crimea or abkhazia . 
  ( and enough with the gun to their heads , ukraine and georgia never offered those lands a chance for a referendum ) . 
   using your own logic should n't france give up some territory to isil supporters that are french citizens , since they obviously not interested in whole `` united france '' thing ? 
  just sayin . . uhm , what part ? 
  they seem more keen on going to syria . 
  and do you think there are any countries in nato that want to include georgia and ukraine ? 
  besides the us ? 
  georgia should solve this problem by giving ossetia and abkhazia up . 
  having some official borders . 
   the amount of killing in the syrian civil war makes him a lot worse than other middle-east regimes which at least keep the peace . 
  well sadly he is backed by a powerful country that wants to maintain its naval base . 
  and unlike a random dictator , the alawites and part of the syrian society still wants him . 
  well it doesnt seem to me that russia is interfering into poroschenko 's work . 
  of course they 'll ask for more autonomy for the rebels . 
  and what does eastern europe want to do about ukraine , in a realistic sense ? 
  exactly . 
  so adding in the mix the west saying of assad must leave now knowing full well russia has a base in the med thanks to assad , sounds like a ridiculous situation . 
  you got ta admit , the fucker killed and slaughter but even after 5 years now he 's still in charge in parts of syria . 
  and there are no signs that the alawites are against him . 
  the ukraine situation was calmed down thanks to minsk 2 . 
  i 'll for being hard on crime , drugs , prostitution and russia , but do you really want a hot war in ukraine ? 
   bloodiest middle-east tyrants are we talking about bahrain , qatar or saudi arabia ? 
  we should : a ) pacify the region b ) organise peaceful elections ( maybe split up syria , who knows ) . 
  can you solve this issues without russia ? 
   linkevicius :  `` we must not link them '', 
  ah yes . 
  montenegro . 
  we 'll sure win that war against isis now, 
  you can not close borders fully , just put controls . 
  the belgians knew the guy is a radicalised islamist but that information was n't passed to the french . 
  dont forget the french didnt know he was a radicalised dude . 
  and they didnt have an arrest warrant . 
  the belgians knew he was an islamist , they might have caught him . 
  had they closed the borders after the paris attacks maybe things would have been better ( at least caught the dude on the run ) . 
  that 's why a unified response needs to be taken . 
  and just because other people started it , it doesnt make it right . 
  the rape or berlin was n't something fair , was it ? 
   well terrorists can use the same loophole to acquire a passport which means they can skip too and fro through whatever borders and throughout the eu , at next to nothing . 
  uhm , i kinda doubt an arab can go to romania and ask for a passport while saying he 's got romanian grandparents . 
  people aint dumb man . 
  well im more concerned about terrorists . 
  one problem at a time . 
   you ca n't have common borders without common security . 
  you can not have common security without a common and unified reaction to threats . 
  we dont have that because we have 28 countries with 28 different constitutions , 28 ( give or take ) armies , 28 intel services and a ton of different languages . 
  you 're asking for a severe level of integration that frankly i doubt it can be done . 
  compare military spending across countries . 
  they 're not passing the border . 
  they 're getting a passport . 
  and we 're talking about terrorist threats . 
  they have sebastopole , plus greece is getting closer to russia . 
   they 're not so much the illegal immigrant and refugee route , more the organised crime route and how they can buy eu citizenship for around $ 5000 , even less if they 're willing to wait . 
  was n't there a case of a nigerian dude giving a polish hooker 2500 euros so he can get a danish residency permit . 
  he got to keep her kid . 
  also let 's read the title again :  frontex , the eu border agency warned of ** migrant terror ** threat 18 months ago - but nothing was done lets keep things relevant . 
  this is about borders . 
   the inability of europe to protect its borders has been blamed on a combination of a lack of resources in poorer members like greece , romania and bulgaria and privacy concerns that have stalled necessary legislation in the european parliament . '', 
  not many refugees or illegal immigrants go through romania and bulgaria but hey lets lump those in . 
  the stade de france kamikaze that 's not identified ( so ** not ** european ) went through serbia . 
  and nobody is particularly happy . 
  should n't nato learn from its mistakes ? 
  okay ... 
  you 're strawmaning and moving the goal post .
