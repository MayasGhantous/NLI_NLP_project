  the russian rebels and the ukranians killed civilians and not in a context of hostages . 
  that makes 0 logic . 
  if you kill civilians , ou 're responsible for killing them . 
  you dont go : `` the enemy made me do it '' . 
  yeah . 
  having crazy leaders will sure do wonders for nato pr . 
  we also how balanced quasi-dictators are . 
  if he starts a crackdown on population , that 'll be just graaand . 
  yeah but luxembourg did n't see anti-govt protests . 
  heck juncker ruled for 95-2013 , dukanovic was in power from 1990 until god knows when . 
  with this wine , you wo n't have to worry if you spill it on your black shirt . 
  it 'll fit just in . 
  the bouquet has an after taste of red fruits , strawberries and anti-semitism . 
  are they bringing anything to the table or is nato extending just for the sake of it . 
  well these actions of sabotage dont exactly prove that crimea should remain ukrainian . 
   killing 8000 civilians did russian rebels kill all those civilians ? 
  crimeans were screwed over by being annexed by russia . 
  lets prove that by screwing them over a little more . 
   not saying ur going to hell for this tho are romanian prisons that welcoming ? 
  see . 
  now people will just spend time petting the puppy instead of fighting terrorists . 
  how can we be sure it 's not a trojan puppy ? 
  well what proof is there ? 
   if the authorities did n't take any action then i 'm disappointed in them if authorities snoop though emails it 's bad . 
  if anonymous dos it , it 's good . 
  the fact that it 's this spread out , makes me doubt its veracity . 
   prime minister ** emmanuel ** valls told parliament thats top notch reporting right there . 
  uhm . 
  one of the paris attackers is known to have left france for belgium . 
  i 'm sure if i pick a random street in brussels , the chance of seeing 5 personnel transport truck are quite slim . 
  though come to think of it , someone tipped the french that abaaoud was in france . 
  it was probabl the moroccans that are detaining his brother . 
  but you never know apparently abaaoud took the refuge route to get into europe . 
  i would much rather france leave schengen and if refugees apply for asylum we analyse their case . 
  or if illegal immigrants get in we dont send them to camps * than * have france stay in the eu and support creating camps for illegal immigrants . 
  then islam should be more chill towards weed then . 
  well we have the constitutional court . 
  ans the justice system . 
  they can not pass laws after lawq after laws without having the consititutional law called to asses the situation . 
   the link represent people who would support a legal punishment for leaving islam . 
  it does n't mean they 're going to enact it themselves . 
  well ask saudi arabia . 
  i 'm sure they 're happy to give you data . 
  stop making up excuses for retarded regimes because `` hey only 10 people were executed this year using this law , it 's fine guys ! '', 
  it 's a sickening belief . 
  how many homosexuals have been executed by the gov in iran and saudi arabia ? 
  how many apostates ? 
  how many people accused of blasphemy ? 
  everyone of those deaths is shocking and should ** not ** happen in the 21st century . 
  france was announced about the bozo brothers . 
  not that there will be a terrorist attack . 
  is this an actual talk about facts and figures or are we just having an argument on suppositions , ifs and buts ? 
  i guess it 's the latter so we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
  cheers . 
  it 's supposed to be severe . 
  it 's a state of war - lite . 
  they have to pass it though parlament . 
  and lawyers can ask the constitutional court if it 's constitutional . 
  state of emergency in france means the can do house arrests or search homes without warrants . 
  lawyers can ask the constitutional court to stop it . 
  france is a police state atm and is it not meant to last forever . 
   but i still think you 're underestimating the role this gaff may play . 
  sadly , i think you 're over estimating it . 
  taubira is seen as the devil by regular fn voters and as someone completely lax on crime by the right ( that 's a cardinal sin for those people ) . 
  so taubira is fair game for anything that ranges from pure racism to bs attacks on her policy . 
  you have to undestand that state of emergency in france is much more strict than state of emergency in the us . 
  i ' france they can do house arrests , they can do house checks , they can ban apublic gatherings all without a warrant/judge supervision . 
  if in 1961 , it only lasted 2 years , i 'm not too worried then . 
  ( alger putsch , oas , assassination attempts against de gaulle , etc ), 
   furthermore , i literally proved to you that 76 % of the arabs wanted unification you showed a poll at a certain moment in time . 
  heck if you give such a poll during a gaza bombing by israel , i 'm sure the numbers would increase . 
   you clearly never visited an arabic country in your life , so stop theorizing about something you do n't understand and stop wasting my time . 
  well stop spending time on reddit on continue circle jerking about a united arabic world . 
  i 'm sure it 'll happen , some day ... 
  good to know . 
  it 's also good to know that the us and france have different constitutions and different laws . 
  that means that even though those two objects have the same name , they 're not the same thing . 
  to extend the state of emergency after these 3 months , there will have to be parlamentary votes . 
  at some point the constitutional court will be called . 
   if anything this is another example of brotherly connection . 
  adversity creates connection . 
  it 's a survival thing . 
  what will happen when that adversity disappears ? 
  how long can people blame the west , sykes picot , balfour . 
  at some time people will have to realise their problems come from withing not because of america , the jews or mossad . 
   arabs listen to the same music , watch the same movies , and have similar political views . 
  we also speak the same fucking language . 
  the same goes for the english world . 
  i dont see uk and the us joining hands in one big fatass country . 
  heck i dont see canada and the us uniting . 
  i dont see spanish speaking america uniting . 
  time to let pipe dreams go and see how each society can improve, 
  again , it 's like saying france will be in a state of war permanently . 
  the fact that reassures me is that they 're added to the state of emergency laws . 
  it 's not a general law like the patriotic act that is supposed to be renewed every x number of years, 
  i think someone has n't seen the movie 300 . 
   why was this massive flow of people not a problem before ? 
  probably because people realised : okay i 've been in this camp for 4 years . 
  the war isnt stopping , syria is under rubles , screw this i 'm going to europe . 
   not to mention we will have to see how welcoming france is to refugees after its next election .
