  the present is the present . 
  do lebanese really wan na unite with syrians and jordany . 
  do saudi arabians really wan na unite with them all ? 
   this does not necessarily mean that all of the ot is now void , it rather means that it might be ok that not all laws in there are followed to the comma if there is a better , kinder option available . 
  nobody 's saying ot is void . 
  people are saying that in xtianity ot is much less considered than nt . 
  it is not incredibly difficult to tell a xtian : well in the ot it was like that but in the nt it 's like this . 
  people wont cry heresy . 
  a christian legal system exists . 
  but like you say : it 's very debated and really not at all as strict and precise as the sharia . 
  actually i dont think there 's a clear stance . 
  marine never participated at the manif pour tous ( the protest against gay marriage ) . 
  she declared she 's against gay marriage but giving succession rights for the pacs . 
  ( so gay marriage without calling it marriage ) . 
  it 's not clear cut . 
   many . 
  some examples : zacarias moussaoui ( french , convicted for involvement in 9/11 ) , muhamed al-owhali ( british , us embassy bombings ) , richard reid ( british , shoe bomber ) , said bahaji ( german , 9/11 ) . 
   how many western european were fighting for al qaeda ? 
  the answer to the question how many implies a quantitative value . 
  a number if you will . 
  an estimate . 
  you gave me 4 . 
   you should take a look at the first half of the bible , also called `` old testament '' ... ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_testament )  it is still regarded as valid and relevant , though depending on which church you ask , some claim the laws in there are not to be enforced literally these days ( which probably is for the better ) . 
  it is still very much a part of christianity and there are people out there that try to enforce some more archaic rules in there as well to this day . 
  it 's as much a part of xtiniaty as probably the new testament is important to the muslims . 
  xtians dont build their lives around the old testament . 
  all masses and the vast majority of reading during mass is done from the new testament . 
   http://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/3733/does-the-new-testament-override-the-old-testament the old testament is the old world . 
  the new one is the new world . 
   it puzzles me that when a terrorist tells the world his reasons the world rejects it and tries to make up their own reasons . 
  if a terrorist says something , it 's for propaganda reasons . 
  they 're ** friggin terrorists ** . 
  communists thought all tbe problems in the world stem from class system . 
  anarchists thought all the problems in the world stem from govt imposing its will on people . 
  corsicans , eta because there is n't an independent state . 
  palestinians because there is n't an independent state . 
  the day i 'll listen to what terrorists tell me , is the day terrorists win . 
  ah yes . 
  the fine historians at isis . 
  i am sure they have a fine balanced and fair analysis of the situation . 
  since that 's what they do . 
  present the west in an unbiased light . 
  tomorrow we 'll analysis jewish behaviour and history based on commentry from the nazis and our course book will be the protocols of the elders of zion . 
  and tell me why lebanon , syria , jordan , etc did n't unite after 46 is so it was their deep deep desire ? 
  germany united after 40 years . 
  so that 's 30 years only when syria and lebanon and jordan became independent . 
  stop finding excuses . 
  the hashemites was n't some middle eastern global arabic tribe . 
  they wanting to be united and the evil west splitting them . 
  they could have united 3 times until now . 
  personal rhetoric is n't historic reality . 
   this really is n't the reason why arabs never united . 
  syria and jordan for example are sunni majority . 
  and lebanon ? 
  you 're claiming the arabs were promissed a country . 
  are you high ? 
  when did anyone ever promissed you algeria , egypt or whatever ? 
  and what the hell is this . 
  if syria , lebanon and saudi arabia wanted to unite , they could have happily done it after 45 . 
  they can unite now . 
  there are lany examples of countries that united . 
  italy , germany , romania , germany a second time in 89 , poland , etc. . . 
  if that 's the desire , how is sykes picot stopping you ? 
  and what were the kurds promissed ? 
  or are you saying the kurds wanted to live under your rule ? 
  i 'm reading my comment . 
  i 'm reading yours . 
  i 'm missing something . 
   sykes-picot is the reason arab countries are n't united today , so syles picot went back in time and created the shia and sunnis . 
  til . 
   arabs have multiple , weak countries instead of a strong unified one . 
  so a country from morocco to yemen ? 
  that 's why there is n't a country like that ? 
  you should google sykes picot because i think you know what it means . 
  it 's not resentment . 
  it 's installing a new political system . 
  eta and corsicans want independence . 
  communists wanted their new system . 
  so for anarchists . 
   wait ... are you literally saying `` actual terrorist attacks are not important , what matters are my perceived threats ? '' . 
  did you read what i 'm saying ? 
  it 's a wave buddy . 
  isis is a wave . 
  it 's not one , two guys that once you elimonated you 're fine . 
  they 're french born , they 're belgian born . 
  and there are thousands of them ...  i 'll think i 'll pass on this wonderful opportunity of having this `` honest debate '' in which all i do is read wikipedia and google information for you . 
  cheap shots . 
  how smurt . 
   but the quran and sharia are not the same thing . 
  that i did n't argue . 
  i agree  than there 's also human reasoning , which is especially important in shia jurisprudence . 
  of course , i fully agree with that . 
  and lets talk about sharia . 
  how does a modern muslim deal away with sharia ? 
  to live in a modern society all islamic countries will have to remove sharia and use a separation between state and religion . 
  how ready are muslim voters to say : yeah sharia , thanks but no thanks ? 
  we need a secular system ? 
  the border controls were put on ** after ** the strikes . 
  and it 's only on the french . 
  cuz europe means if you have a problem , it 's on you to solve it .
