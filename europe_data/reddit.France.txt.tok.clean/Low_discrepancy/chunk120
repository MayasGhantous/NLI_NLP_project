  communication break down one after the other between agencies . 
  and border patrol doing a great job . . 
  but it 's good that the police does n't share information on thugs . 
  this way , when they leave your country , they 're no longer your problem . 
  and once they leave belgium , they 're off the grid then , right ? 
  because they did n't tell the french jack . 
  i understand that hindsight is 20/20 . 
  but darn , we 're opening our borders but not our data on thugs ? 
  wtf ? 
  clearly there 's a problem . 
  yes . 
  but hey the state will make money . 
   i think admitting yourself that you are one hundred percent going to die at the end of the day might be a little harder than planning escape . 
  that 's why they take drugs to lower their inhibition levels . 
   just trying to say that this is not a bunch of 15 year olds doing a drive by with uzis . 
  nobody is saying that . 
  what everybody 's saying is that they had the knowhow from syria and everything . 
  it 's not like omg you got ta be a master of organisation to pull this off . 
   they received training for this and it was plotted for a while . 
  yeah . 
  no one 's saying no to that . 
  but you 're making it an ocean 's 11 plot . 
   eric van der sypt , spokesman for the belgian federal prosecutor 's office , told politico tuesday . 
  `` but they showed no sign of possible threat . 
  even if we had signaled them to france , i doubt that we could have stopped them . '' read that statement again . 
   ** even if we had signaled them to france , i doubt that we could have stopped them . 
  ** abdesalam salah was stopped at a border control leaving france on friday evening . 
  he was n't arrested because there was n't any warrant on him . 
  but i tend to believe that if the police had the info : oh look suspected islamist is leaving france . 
  surely they would have detained him to have things clear up . 
  ** wtf ** europe . 
  if someone that has the same name as you do does the slightest retarded thing , and you go to the us , you can expect to be held up several hours . 
  in europe ? 
  meh why bother sharing fucking information ... 
  it 's not like it 'll ever be useful . 
  moar europe guys . 
  considering that the kamikazes at the stade de france did n't do a significant damage ( sadly one dead , iirc ) . 
  so nope . 
  this this some genius plot . 
  clearly they were panicking when they were refused entry . 
   you 'll want to know the entries , the exits , floor plans . 
  stop glorifying these fucktards . 
  happily the vast majority of people escaped out of the bataclan . 
  it can hold 1200 people and friday , it was packed . 
   when we were having riots in turkey i was never arrested for anything so you admit escaping is the difficult part . 
  they did n't have to plan for this at all . 
  are you a troll ? 
  that 's more himmler . 
  and do you think criminals that have been doing crime all their life will just turn legal ? 
  nope . 
  they 'll find new venues of profit . 
  legalise drugs ? 
  well they 'll sell them cheaper . 
  legalise prostitution ? 
  we 'll just bring slaves you can screw at half the price . 
  people who know only crime wont become good honest members of the economy . 
  some will some wont . 
  i 'm deffo for legalising weed . 
  other hard drugs , not so much . 
  i am kinda pleasantly surprised how low key the critiques against encryption have been , in france . 
  the article cites just `` two anonymous officials '' . 
  and the article is fully focused on brennan . 
  is anyone surprised the director of the cia is against encryption for the general population ? 
  they should get at least 20 years in jail . 
  yeah . 
  it was n't a super loud one . 
  so probably just a drunk or two . 
  not huge parts of the crowd like turkey . 
   i know people will say that the terrorists were born in france . 
  the guy that used the fake syrian passport was n't european his photo has been shown all over the media . 
  yet no european came up and said :  omg i know this guy , i 've been with him in 12th grade . 
   oh wow , that 's joe . 
  he worked with me at mcdonalds . 
   quick call the cops . 
  that 's the guy that buys his groceries from me . 
  so he 's either * a european that ** never ** left his house . 
  and has ** no acquaintances ** . 
  ( so he should be on / r/europe ) or * he 's not european but from some part of the world going through a war , where people do n't have time to check western media and call the police . 
  a place like say iraq or syria . 
  what is more likely to you ? 
  and that 's why twitter is shit for news . 
  even twitter accounts from respected news organisations . 
  honestly , i read somewhere that they had tickets . 
  in another place that they did n't have tickets . 
  we 'll have to wait and see . 
  that being said , even if they did have them , what do you security officers to do ? 
  the may have had a dead man trigger . 
  do security agents get the training that says : hey if you see a bomb , jump on it . 
  you 'll die but you may save some lives . 
  i get off on erdogan , your democratically elected ~ ~ sultan ~ ~ . 
  you on innocent people being killed . 
  turkey wont get much sympathy from me , 
  ah yes . 
  the people that voted for erdogan were hanging on europe to show how much of a baddie he is . 
  we sure dropped the ball on this one . 
  a friend had a vatican euro though . 
  it was pretty sweet . 
   there was also `` open borders '' pro-refugees demonstration , although only a few hundreds people attended . 
  ** photos here ** well those arguments convinced me  . 
  i hope those protests for open stuff too .
