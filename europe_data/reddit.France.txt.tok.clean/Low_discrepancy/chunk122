  for every muslim handed , we 'd get a kinder egg . 
  my mantle is full of them . 
  i was very active . 
   who would then take them to dodgy sites in poland and lithuania to torture . 
  france obviously . 
   the pkk is responsible for the death of thousands of people . 
  if your offended by isis then you would understand the hatred turks have for the pkk . 
  i dont understand torture . 
  there was torture committed during the algerian war , and you dont see me cheering for that . 
  it 's shameful part of history . 
  are you incapable of introspection ? 
   we are evil am i evil by cheering for erdogan , he 's your democratically elected president ? 
  am i evil by explaining why at the next election , erdogan will again win ? 
  am i evil for wanting a long visa process for people who cheer at moments and silence or support who torture , like you did ? 
   this hypocrisy is incredible . 
  much like the people in this video , your anger is misplaced . 
  europe is not the cause of why turkey is in the situation it is . 
  it is the choice of the sovereign people of turkey that was expressed . 
   we are evil yes , you 're evil for supporting torture . 
  poor guy . 
  he was probably a drunkard . 
  your callousness simply shows that turkey is in the state it deserves to be and will only sink lower and lower in its islamist wet dreams . 
  i 'll be munching pop-corn and cheering . 
  yooohooo , a new palace maybe , yuppy . 
  more islamist bs , awesome . 
  every election , he 'll take out the `` kurdish treat '' bs threat and you 'll vote for him like crazy . 
  how easy is it to get a visa for the eu ? 
  it wont get any easier  . 
  my schadenfreude boner is suuuper hard . 
  why is n't erdogan banning twitter tonight ? 
  you got the leader you deserve . 
   the 59 year old woman you speak of she was tortured by the ** turkish ** police . 
  you mean  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sakine_cans%c4%b1z  she was arrested and ** tortured by turkish police ** . 
  happy man ? 
  can you get a justice boner tonight ? 
  59 yo woman . 
  head shots . 
  i bet she was a huge threat to your little state . 
  i bet you can be happy your turkish right now . 
  you sure proved me wrong man . 
  god france is a horrible state . 
  the other victims : a 29 yo woman and a 26 yo one . 
  feeling big now ? 
  justice huh ? 
   france sheltering pkk members  http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/28/dix-kurdes-condamnes-a-paris-pour-financement-du-pkk_4565253_3224.html here you go dude .

   http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/07/23/assassinat-de-militantes-kurdes-a-paris-la-justice-pointe-l-implication-des-services-secrets-turcs_4694801_1653578.html congratz . 
  you killed a 59 yo woman . 
  a 29 yo woman and a 26 yo one . 
  headshots . 
  do you feel manly now ? 
  is justice flowing through your veins . 
  women that couldnt hurt you at all were shot in the head . 
  more details . 
  the 59 yo woman https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sakine_cans%c4%b1z tortured by turkish police . 
   i do n't have time to go into detail at the moment . 
  it 's there somewhere in the bottom comments . 
  okay so a reddit comment is your reference . 
  k.  also there is the whole libya thing . 
  yes . 
  what lybian thing ? 
  dude you throw huge accusations and you cite a redditor and a comment thrown in the air . 
  thanks . 
  ah dany le rouge strikes again . 
  that dead people are actually zombies and they really like damian lewis and the series he 's in . 
  yes . 
  football hooligans are huge humanists :d you gave me a laugh man . 
  you really did . 
   angry at france for plenty of other reasons like supporting terrorism wtf ? 
  again with the kurds ? 
   majority of those people are akp voters , this is exactly what one would expect from them . 
  and you 're the pro-european ? 
  just so i have a reference point . 
  yeah . 
  eastern europe super wants turkey to get easy treatment . 
  i heard you 're also close to cyprus and greece . 
  lets face it man , turkey simply is n't liked and looking at this video , you brought it on yourselves . 
   yes , and the government ran a much stricter course against nuclear energy than they did before ( one of merkel 's famous 180 \u00b0 turns people make fun of ) so the popularity of the greens died down a bit . 
  that statement confuses me . 
  germany went to full on coal . 
  they 're one of the worst co2 emitters in europe . 
  why did the greens die down ? 
   yesterday i literally heard someone on facebook saying french deserve the attacks because of what they did in algeria . 
  oh on facebook i saw people saying it 's the jews planning everything . 
  french people saying it . 
  the type of french people super interested into the palestine problem . 
  you know what i mean . 
  but it 's always the 20 % that cause 80 % of the problems . 
  i 'm sure if the fn ever gets to power , they 'll be super chill with the turkish . 
  so you 're saying we should n't ease the visa process for the turkish ? 
  okay i know how i 'll vote . 
  thanks . 
   france going to invade turkey ? 
  uhm euro 2016 . 
  check where it 'll take place . 
  down with foie gras !, 
  down my throat !, 
   football fans go look at football fans on wembley . 
  google minute of silence on wembley .
