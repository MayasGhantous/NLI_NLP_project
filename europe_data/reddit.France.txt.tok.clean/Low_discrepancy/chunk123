  those fuckers better expect a warm welcome in france . 
  http://www.todayszaman.com/sports_turkey-greece-square-off-in-i-stanbul-friendly_404391.html istanbul . 
  the ** `` european '' ** city . 
   it 's football match it 's just a few young people without any aim . 
  he was just stressed , he did n't mean to kill anyone . 
  they 're all running away from war . 
  da fuq is this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_georgians_in_south_ossetia#/media/file:zarskaya_tragedy_1.jpg :o, 
  honest question . 
  dunno why i didnt ask it before . 
  dont you feel that after the game with chile , you didnt exactly deserve to be in that semi ? 
  7 was unexpected , but the fact that you 'd lose shouldnt have been a surprise right ? 
  schengen is not europe . 
  we had europe before 1995 . 
  plus spain wont have to leave schengen . 
   being outside schengen is our only way of stopping this . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  but i get people telling me oh noes . 
  it 'll be useless and cost money . 
  baddies will be bad and find a way . 
  it 's hopeless . 
  oh also got a 1914 comment . 
  getting out of schengen will start a new war between france and germany . 
  i lived 100m from the bataclan you twat . 
  paris was under a curfew for the weekend . 
  for the whole of the weekend , in ile de france all public gatherings were banned . 
  how big is ile de france 12000 sqkm . 
  france started border controls . 
  you dont realise how much harm 2 cars with ak47s can do . 
  do you think they stay still ? 
  you dont need to threaten ** every fucking person in a city ** . 
   if threats like this were credible well there was a car with explosives found , so yeah it 's friggin credible . 
  trolls , they 're everywhere . 
  and if terrorists are planning drive byes like in paris , that 200sqkm size does n't mean shit . 
  the distance between the stade de france and bataclan is about 10km . 
  this is n't a traffic crash dude , it 's a terrorist attack where you dont know where they are , who they are and what plans they have . 
  again , do you think ? 
  me too . 
  and your country is n't crumbling because you 're not in schengen , is it ? 
   this part interests me the most . 
  what was his reasoning ? 
   guys there 's a bomb placed next to stadium , but 200 m away there 's a birthday party at the nice kebab around the corner . 
  you can go to that party but dont come to the stadium . 
  that 's a normal statement right ? 
  when there 's a terrorist risk it 's just in a 50m by 50m area right ? 
  god some people are slow . 
  https://twitter.com/cnnnewsroom edit : so this confirms cnn is shit . 
  first and last time i 'm following news on twitter . 
  it seems confirmed . 
  it 's fucking awesome nothing happened . 
  it friggin sucks it 's the beginnig . 
  you will have ** information ** . 
  now we know one terrorist left france for belgium because border police checked identities of those that were leaving france . 
  sadly there was n't an arrest demand at the time . 
  if i 'm going into germany , italy , spain i should have to present an id . 
  wait for the police reports . 
  during the paris attacks we were getting reports about shootings in 5-7 different places in paris . 
  i 'm still hoping it 's nothing because it would be awful . 
   does it make that much of a difference ? 
  having known terrorists on the prowl that can move freely from country to country ? 
  and most likely have ak 47s ? 
  that are responsible for the death of 129 people ? 
  i guess i 'm not cool as you . 
  it kinda bothers me . 
  heat seaking , motion sensors there are a ton of better ways to detect these guys than pattern recognition . 
  that 's why i support any political candidate that is for getting france out of schengen . 
  well two terrorist from friday are on the run . 
  where are they ? 
  in france , belgium , germany , poland , finland ? 
  who knows ? 
  thanks schengen . 
  uhm the guy that 's not identified wont be european . 
  uhm boston attacks . 
   actually watching the people who are on the list of people to watch on french tv a security expert said it takes 18 people to follow 24/7 one person . 
  3h to transcribe 1h of phone call . 
  that 's a lot of people . 
   small criminality by small criminality i mean people with ak 47s and rpgs . 
   the only way this should happen is if he moves out of georgia uhm what about abkhazia and south ossetia ? 
  are you saying they really really want to be part of georgia ? 
  do you have any sources about statistics or polls on the desires of those people ? 
  they 'll become the new isis . 
  no more salafists . 
   and really , there 's much more immigration to western europe from eastern europe yup , fellow europeans . 
   there are noticeable improvements and therefore , hope for the future . 
  that 's enough . 
  improvements about what ? 
  i 'm just saying poverty or inequality does not cause terrorism . 
  it can cause criminality ( mafia , drug trafficking , prostitution , abuse ) but terrorism is so so much more . 
  terrorism is an ideology . 
  it is a political ideology . 
  even the largest mafioso wont want to create a mafia country . 
  all terrorists ( anarchists , islamic , ira , eta , corsicans , al qaeda , brievik ) . 
  they all have ** political ** reasons . 
  criminals have ** no ** political goals . 
  so enough with the bs inequality , poverty , racism causes terrorism . 
  it 's an inept analysis . 
  this convo has gone for a bit too long . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
  because that was the agenda of your head honchos . 
  :p but it was n't because omg the french , the british , the israelis need help guys . 
  i already gave my biometric data .
