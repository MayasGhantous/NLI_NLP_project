  so i 'm okay for everybody to do it of course . 
  :p when big evil govt comes get me i want all of you to get gathered too . 
  i like privacy . 
  i do . 
  i dont want ** any ** laws againdt encryption . 
  but you can dismantle nsa tomorrow and we 'll still have terrorist attacks in europe . 
  so i fail to see how your options get any close to solving our problems . 
   i honestly feel it is n't zionism ruining the arab world , its anti-zionism . 
  i honestly doubt islamic leaders are actually anti-zionist . 
  they 're just using israel as a scapegoat . 
  the sad reality , even moderate muslims are a tiny bit obsessed with the jewish . 
  i had one too many convos with my muslim friends on that issue . 
   the biggest point of anger at israel , from the arab world and from arab communities in europe is about the west bank colonies . 
  do n't drink the cool aid . 
  israel is just the scape goat of shitty islamic policies . 
  does n't rain in the desert ? 
  the jewish did it . 
  islamist terrorist attacked kosher super market ? 
  mossad is trying to discredit the muslims . 
  i wish it were a joke . 
  the terrorist group ? 
  so that 's your example . 
  hey i didnt joing this terrorist group . 
  i joined this other one . 
  i 'm a cool terrorist . 
  that would mean the us being okay with keeping assad . 
  heck even i am not convinced that assad is a good idea . 
  honestly i have ** no ** idea about syria . 
  it 's waaay over my head . 
   some of the top ten countries have a sizable muslim population . 
  bahrain # 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011\u20132012_bahraini_uprising bahrain has sharia . 
  if you steal you can get your hands chopped off . 
  do you want that safety in europe or are you a troll ? 
  and rightfully so . 
  no one should praise brievik . 
  uhm i think you should calm down . 
  you risk burting an artery . 
  but what about the pope and his  if you insult my mom , you can expect a punch to the face . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-pope-francis-says-those-who-ridicule-others-religions-should-expect-a-punch-9980192.html he 's the cool pope right ? 
  uhm no . 
  20-30 years of sustained political effort to clean up the french ghettos . 
  the same goes for other countries . 
  these are no-go zones for the police . 
  small criminality is big there.and they have a fuckton of guns . 
  yeah . 
  i mean in 30 years , who knows how life will be by then . 
  but now there are serious structural problems . 
  and i dont see them getting fixed in the next decade . 
   it 's more that this system they have implemented bypasses the normal security channels . 
  i mean after the attacks . 
  3 days have passed and we havent identified him even though we have an `` ideal photo '' and a passport . 
  so there are two options . 
  european security agencies suck . 
  or he 's not european . 
  which ever fits your logic . 
  i 've picked mine and i 'm choosing to vote for any party that wants to leave schengen . 
   one possible outcome is that anti-terrorist law enforcement agencies collaborate and gradually reopen schengen borders as countries are considered `` clear '' and having sufficient border-control measures . 
  what 's a clear country ? 
  when can france declare it 's clean ? 
  when can belgium declare it 's clean . 
  caught on camera is not ideal passport photo . 
  camera has oclusions , shadows , low quality . 
  and a bank robbery ** is not a fucking terrorist attack ** where 129 people died . 
  so ya know . 
  a bit of a difference . 
  but i hope to god they took a photo from your passport . 
  lets do a test . 
  blow yourself up and leave your photo on the crime scene . 
  lets see how long it takes to identify you . 
  i 'll vote for the party that wants to get france out of schengen . 
  uhm . 
  the dude that went through greece has n't been identified yet . 
  meaning he 's not french at least . 
   real passport and real name may be flagged by security services . 
  if his real name and real passport are flagged , the police would have found him by now cuz they have his photo . 
   syria to france on his french passport that 's ** bullshit ** . 
  if he were french , he would be identified with his photo by now . 
  kinda weird no security agency in europe has the guy 's finger prints or photo . 
  edit : so either european security agencies are crap . 
  or he 's not european . 
  which one fits your personal agenda ? 
  edit2 : i 'm fucking retarded . 
  he 's photo was shown all over the news . 
  nobody came up to say : omg i know this guy . 
   the french intelligence chief should resign effective immediately the use your vote.at the next french elections vote for the party that is for forcing the boss of the dgse to resign . 
  what are you complaining to me . 
  use your vote . 
  if you have one . 
   so what border controls will protect france against french and belgian strikers like the ones found out so far ? 
  we know one of the guys that rented the car that carried an attack and a brother of one of the suicide brothers has left france . 
  see dude . 
  border controls work . 
  we ** more ** information . 
  now less . 
  of course now we have no idea where in europe the dickhead is . 
  do you know ? 
  also a type of attack like on the thalys is impossible to be carried out on the eurostar . 
  do you know why ? 
  because your bags get checked when going to uk . 
  you have to be 30 mins before train departure to enter the uk to pass customs .
