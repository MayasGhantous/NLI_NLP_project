  you have to be 2 mins before train departure to enter france . 
  that shit is not normal . 
  nemmouche committed a terrorist strike in belgium and was caught in marseille by random in a bus . 
  he still had his ak 47 in his bags . 
  so dont give me bs about how borderless europe is great when dealing with crime cuz recent history proves how much of a bs statement that is . 
   france is n't welcoming external misery , it 's generating internal one , fuelled by reactionaries like the fellow you quote . 
  are you trollin ? 
   terrorism is a form of criminality people who blow themselves up are n't simple criminals . 
   ghettos are problematic because of the disparity with other parts . 
  in eastern europe the difference is smaller . 
  true . 
  in romania you dont have people in the big cities driving huge suvs and exotic cars while people in the shitty countryside dont have running water . 
  that does n't exist at all . 
  they 'll all equally poor . 
  cuz it 's eastern europe . 
   the things you 've mentioned hardly affect their day-to-day lives again you 're using rational thought . 
  they are bothered in their day to day lives by women who wear skirts , by people who pray to the wrong god , by people who enjoy music and sports . 
  why dont they bomb mosques ? 
  the charlie hebdo , stade de france and bataclan attacks are not random . 
  imagine giving your life to a supreme cause ? 
  wouldnt you pick something symbolic ? 
  something big ? 
  they obssess about these things in their day to day lives . 
  it bothers them oh , and they do bomb mosques . 
  they bomb mosques in muslim countries . 
  shia mosques or sectarian mosques because they 're the wrong type of muslim . 
   there 's also a huge legal difference between not letting someone leave and not letting them come back . 
  who 's not letting them come back ? 
  who 's saying they should be arrested after they come back : everybody . 
  edited, 
   will they vanish like balloons if they 're told they ca n't enter ? 
  it 'll ripple down . 
  the greeks let them in because they know it 's not their problem . 
  the thow the hot potatoe to other countries . 
  serbia . 
  and that to others . 
  and so on and so forth . 
  hungary closed its borders and it stopped . 
   will they vanish like balloons i 'll quote michel rocard former socialist pm of france  la france ne peut pas accueillir toute la mis\u00e8re du monde france can not welcome all of the worlds misery . 
  your country is free to do that and france is free to introduce border controls to protect itself . 
  uhm better control of the refugee situation for starters . 
  that 's a new thing and a good thing . 
  plus once catalunia leaves spain , there will have to be a border with it . 
   why is n't hollande calling for tougher external borders rather than suspending schengen for example ? 
  uhm because france has a smaller border than the eu and guarding something small is easier than guarding something large . 
  because france is in danger . 
  these attacks were planned in belgium . 
  why did they choose to attack france and not belgium ? 
  because france is a higher target . 
  because the current refugee crisis is so poorly handled , and there is no political will to change . 
  ** because he 's the president of france and answers to french voters . 
  **  economically you were , did n't prevent any of the world wars of course . 
  if you think france was as close with germany in 1914 as now , you seriously need to go to some history classes . 
  the french hated the germans because of alsace lorraine and they were taught that a war had to done from friggin primary school . 
  that the alsacians needed to be liberated . 
  imagine being told that as a 9 yo kid . 
  and there 's border control with uk . 
  i see no major war brewing at the horizon . 
   you basically compared every refugee to a slow learner that 's because you did n't read my comment . 
  the op was saying that hey will learn from our past mistakes . 
  i 'm saying , no we have n't . 
  so lets not add to the problem . 
  world leaders do what 's on their agenda and what suits their goal . 
  if you think obama will risk american lives for them french , you are sorely mistaken . 
  even after these attacks , the message is still the same : obama : we 'll still keep doing what we 're doing ( bomb isis ) . 
  merkel : we 'll still keep doing what we 're doing ( open the floodgates for refugees ) . 
  there 's no magical solution that can be implemented ** now ** and fix the situation . 
  it 's a long term problem that requires a long term solution . 
  do you really think the world public or the american public will care about the paris attacks for more than a week , two weeks tops ? 
  strikes in france that were planned in belgium are a french problem and a european problem . 
  do n't think policy makers listen to what the public `` thinks '' ( if they do think ) . 
  they 're very much aware that the public cares now because it 's on tv and any support that will cost money , effort or lives will quickly go to 0 . 
  so meh . 
  that 's why you need some foie gras . 
  that delicious cholesterol will plug anything . 
  omg how dare they insult ~ ~ aylan ~ ~ ~ ~ the russians after the place crash ~ ~ the french . 
  goddamit i am so offended . 
   they 'll probably actually love it as it justifies their bogus `` war on islam '' claims in the eyes of their peers you must not have met crazy paranoid people then . 
  they will use ** any ** excuse to say it 's an attack against them . 
  a drawing in a newspaper they never heard about : attack against islam . 
  wearing short skirts : attack against islam . 
  however , hindering their right to congregate might break the circlejerk . 
  some might feel so uncomfortable so that they 'll move to a different country . 
  who knows . 
  plus you can still bug their new gathering place . 
  dont you know : if you do n't let radical islamic preachers spew their hate , that means you 're a dictator . 
  so you did n't post a french flag on your fb account . 
  god i am devastated man . 
  dont you know how much ot helped the french seeing all those french flags projected on every buildong and posted everywhere ? 
  shame on you . 
   civilized white people are more important than unwashed eastern and southern barbarians , yo . 
  yes man . 
  and trust me . 
  it felt so good seeing the french flag posted everywhere . 
  it was almost worth the 129 dead people and 300 injured . 
  as an unwashed eastern , you can only dream how good it feels man . 
  oh god oh god i 've got a patriotic boner . 
   but even so , i wish that more people would demonstrate empathy for these innocent victims goddamit this is not a friggin contest . 
  i dont give a crap what empathy you show for the french victims . 
  just drop the ** i am one with the world , i care about every soul ** bs .
