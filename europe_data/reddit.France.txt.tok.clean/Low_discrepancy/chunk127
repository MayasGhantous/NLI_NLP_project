  she 's shouting that she 's pregnant so she can not jump . 
  only when googling now did i find out she made it . 
  by a miracle she was pulled out by a guy . 
  a guy that a point was facing the terrorists and only survived because the cops raided . 
  i 'm sorry i have 0 fucks to give . 
  http://m.huffpost.com/fr/entry/8573368 see that woman hanging at the window ? 
  she 's screaming that she 's pregant and she ca n't jump . 
  she was pulled out happily . 
  by a guy that survived only because the police gave the assault . 
  i am sorry , i have 0 more fucks to give . 
   but their grieving families reactions makes this even more tragic . 
  that 's because you have a skewed picture . 
  how many interviews have you seen from the family ( parents , kids , siblings , cousins ) of innocent people that did die ? 
  have you seen the interview of the family of the woman that was hanging from the window , 2 storeys high . 
  she said she couldnt jump because she 's pregnant . 
  ~ ~ i dont know of she survived . ~ ~ she survived :d baise ouais . 
  after you read those 129 interviews , start reading the interview of this family . 
  this will give you a proper context i believe . 
  if you wont be emotionally spent , wow , you 're a tough person . 
  a game of hot potatoe . 
  we 're good at it in france too . 
  tales a terrorist attack to raid the ghettos for guns . 
  did you spend 3 mins reading the article :  their mother faklan , speaking to a reporter ** through her nephew ** if an aunt would tell me to say shit like that to the police because a cousin was a terrorist , i 'd shut up and tell her to speak directly to the reporters . 
  am i asking something unreasonable ? 
   dude . . she is just going through the classic first stage of grief : denial first of all the stages of grief are for people that are about to die . 
  second : the person that came up with them : . 
   elisabeth kubler-ross wrote that she regretted writing the stages the way that she did , that people mistook them as being both linear and universal . 
  so lets stop the armchair psychology . 
   she 's probably being pressed by the reporter and wanted to validate her grievance . . 
  it was a nephew that made that statement for the mother . 
  the family is so retarded , they do n't spend one second thinking * is it okay to say this ? 
  that 's why you act first . 
  when someone falls into a putrid ideology , into depression , into whatever , you act . 
  you analyse and you help them . 
  you call in specialists . 
  you look for advice . 
  you call in the authorities . 
  you dont just ignore any problems . 
  this did n't happen in one second . 
  he was n't a normal person then went boom . 
  it 's a long time process . 
  yeah but it 'd shut the fuck up . 
  i 'd lawyer up and shut the fuck up . 
   she 's just as shell shocked as everyone else . 
  that 's why you ** shut the fuck up ** . 
  in case of a tragedy caused by someone you know : ** you shut the fuck up ** . 
  maybe they speak french : ** ferme ta putain de gueule . 
  ** again : when someone you know commits a crime : you lawyer up and ** you shut the fuck up **, 
  love = / = finding excuses . 
  that 's either laziness , not actually caring or obsession . 
  uhm and what would be blasphemous to an atheist ? 
  having people should in the street : god makes sense !, 
  darn you 're funny :d, 
  uhm no , that 's why we have different words for it . 
   to a mother her son will always be her baby . 
  and that 's how you raise a shitty person , everybody !, 
   she 's a victim just like everyone else who lost someone in the tragedy i think we can all agree that the mother is ~ ~ dillusional ~ ~ delusional . 
  yes you can love your child even if they 're utter scum or killers . 
  but that does n't mean one should ** excuse ** their fucking behaviour . 
  her behaviour shows what a shitty parent she is . 
  a parent is fair , not ~ ~ dillusional ~ ~ delusional . 
  they push their kids to be better people not find bs excuses . 
  imagine if you 're raised by such a parent . 
  any shitty thing that happens to you or that * you * do , your parent will tell you it 's someone 's fault , you are perfect . 
   similarly , american cars i mean ford focus is a damn fine little car , but would american cars really be that successful in europe ? 
  we dont have the same gas prices here and there . 
  if by suspects you mean * people who went in syria to support isis * , yeah i wan na throw then in a dungeon . 
   how could that possibly backfire , i wonder . 
  i have no clue . 
  what about the whole removing your shoes at the airport ? 
  was n't that because al qaeda is a bunch of foot fetishists that have won ? 
  uhm , you do realise that the majority of islamist terrorist strikes in france has been caused by native frenchmen that have algerian or moroccan roots , right ? 
  you know that a frenchman with algerian roots is not a syrian or an iraqi , right ? 
   attacking their culture , their religion , and alienating all greeks collectively at every opportunity ah yes . 
  that caused them terrorist attacks . 
  i should start fearing from the gypsies then , because ** no one ** in europe gets more buttfucked than the gypsies . 
  well in france you can be arrested if you can be banned from leaving the territory if it is suspected you 'll commit terrorist acts . 
  [ :d ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xuhtk_leo-ferre-tu-n-en-reviendras-pas_music ), 
   but it has been in my vocabulary since a young age . 
  in europe , irl ? 
  really ? 
  what country ? 
   he is using informal slang on reddit that one would use in the real world i 've never seen white culture used as a term for western culture . 
  lets try again . 
   the tongue-in-cheek figure of speech is used to imply that a statement or other production is humorously ** or ** otherwise not seriously intended see . 
  it 's an ** or ** not an ** and ** . 
  different words mean different things . 
  stop being so offended . 
  it 's unbecoming . 
   the tongue-in-cheek figure of speech is used to imply that a statement or other production is humorously or otherwise ** not seriously intended ** see you 're learning new things today . 
   pretty draconian and generally only done in exceptional circumstances so ... a war ? 
  kinda like in syria ? 
   because you might have done . 
  also people got arrested for trying to do that . 
  tongue in cheek then . 
  goddamn that carrot is lodged deep in there . 
   in other words neither gives an accurate picture of reality . 
  concepts like cultural diversity are never easy to define . 
  see edit , 
   i 've never ever heard such a word used .
