  ca n't you take a joke ? 
   no , but it would reduce the relative attractiveness of terrorist ideologies . 
  it 's something that we do have control over , and in fact we should n't tolerate ghettoisation of anyone . 
  correlation does not imply causality . 
  ghettoisation does ** not ** lead to terrorism . 
  to increased criminality , yes . 
  but not to terrorism . 
  if so , eastern europe should have ablaze with terrorism because the ghettos in france as pretty much identical to those in ee . 
  and i doubt if you go to a ghetto , people will be accepting of the fact that they 're really more likely to become terrorists . 
  so why do you call it white culture when you mean western culture ? 
  is white = = western ? 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  edit : it 's a joke . 
  if you 're offended by it , how come you can take a carrot up your ass but no a simple joke . 
  what 's culturally white ? 
  then dont . 
   also racist against for that 's where our problem comes from i think . 
  vocabulary . 
  it 's not racism but xenophobia ( ethnophobia ) etc. 
   so do thousands of journalists , aid workers and all sorts of other people not intent on being a terrorist . 
  continue reading my comments . 
  lets just say i never had to fill a paper where my `` race '' was asked . 
  my skin colour is just as much part of my identity as my eye colour . 
  and the whole class issue , white privilege ? 
  whites were serfs in europe ( basically slaves ) . 
  and black slavery was n't as wide-spread in continental europe as in the us . 
  i 'm not saying people dont see colour or are quick to judge but its a different type of thing . 
  to the best of my knowledge , we also didnt have official segregation so late in our history as the us . 
  it 's a different dynamic . 
  not saying we 're better . 
  just different . 
  yes but `` black-white '' relations are significantly different in europe compared to canada or the us . 
  it 's not saying there are n't problems but i guess i never identified as white . 
  having to fill out a form where i have to say my `` race '' would be suuuper weird . 
  looking at the whole spanish issue , i didnt expect for there to be such a phrase in catalan . 
  edit : it 's a joke . 
  lighten up people . 
   the 2,000 who can be shown to have fought belong in prison . 
  prosecute them for all i care . 
  but how does a french prosecutor prove you 've been fighting ? 
   you ought to be more proud of your nation 's role in the age of enlightenment and in the championing of human rights . 
  the oas ? 
  is the oas our great contribution to human rights ? 
  or colonialism ? 
  god so many good things to choose from . 
  drancy . 
  darn where do i start ? 
   find out where they were , what they did , who they know , what religion they follow , and where their political tendencies lie . 
  and hayat is just a faithfull wife . 
  she decides to leave france for syria on the 5th . 
  a few days later her husband shoots up a jewish store . 
  what do we do when hayat comes back home ? 
  she didnt fight . 
  and how do you prove she knew her hubby will turn into a terrorist . 
  we 're stuck arent we ? 
   he was going to syria specifically to join isis is there an isis passport ? 
  a card ? 
  a tattoo to prove you are a member of isis ? 
  how do you know the person didnt want to start a business in syria or become a doctor or a journalist ? 
  do you arrest any french citizen that has radical ideas and a ticket to turkey ? 
  or has radical communist ideas and a ticket to north korea ? 
  you agree with me there is an arbitrary point , the person did n't commit a crime but was arrested . 
  now two of the terrorists have spent time in syria . 
  why were they walking freely in france ? 
   you were saying `` arrest everyone who goes to syria '' that was maybe harsh and in the heat of the moment . 
  find a way to lock people up that went to syria without having any sorts of business to be there . 
  even if you join isis , can you prove they committed any nefarious act ? 
  so do you let all 2000 french `` freedom fighters '' come back and walk freely in the street ? 
  https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sanctions-on-syria there 's an embargo on arms , there 's an embargo on financial services , there 's an embargo on luxury items , there 's an embargo on oil and gas and electricity generating industries . 
  if you have business being there : doctors , journalists , some business men . 
  fine . 
  sending wheat to syria . 
  fine . 
  but are you telling me there are 2000 + french wheat sellers in syria ? 
  there are people who have ** no ** business there . 
  no family , no job , no help to provide . 
  they are also known to be radicalists . 
  what do you do with them ? 
  do you ask them ? 
  did you kill anyone ? 
  okay you 're free to go . 
  are you a good guy ? 
  yes ? 
  you 're free to go . 
  how do you prove that a radical islamist that has no family in syria and no business committed a crime ? 
  tell me . 
  i am all ears . 
   that 's a dumb comment . 
  the people are responsible for the actions of their government . 
  lets restart then . 
  how is the [ french government ] ( http://www.gouvernement.fr/ ) allowing thousands to die . 
   i do n't think the french government ever blanket banned travel to syria , but i 'd be interested in a source if they did http://actu.orange.fr/france/interdit-de-quitter-la-france-il-s-appretait-a-partir-en-syrie-un-homme-interpelle-afp_cnt000000eue8z.html a radicalised guy was banned from leaving the french territory . 
  he got arrested because he wanted to go to syria . 
  see . 
  it can be done . 
   the news have been reporting that a lot of kids ( teenagers , not adults ) have been brainwashed into joigning isis . 
  how many teenagers are there in syria ? 
  kouachi was not a teenager when he went to yemen . 
  moustafai was not a teenager when he went to syria . 
   journalists are also reporting .
