  again : people who have ** no ** business being there . 
   some of them have actually gone where the identified training camps are and try to talk some sense into them , to no avail . 
  what percentage ? 
   and shool and business are going on . 
  just because there are terroris groups in a country does n't mean they have stopped trading resources . 
  if there 's no embargo on doing business with syria , there fucking should be . 
  we put an embargo on iran and french banks got severely fined for continuing to do business with iran . 
  and there was ** no ** war . 
  also it seems that an embargo was set with syria :  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/relations_entre_la_syrie_et_l'union_europ\u00e9enne which is fucking normal . 
  assad is bombing his people . 
  dont finance his regime . 
   if a french man travels to damascus to ship goods to that city and returns to france , has he committed a crime ? 
  how many of your freedoms are you willing to sacrifice ? 
  he should be investigated in case he helped the assad regime . 
  france is pushing for assad 's regime to step down . 
  it would send a mixed message : do business with assad but say you 're against him . 
   civilians should n't go to somalia either then , right ? 
  god forbid any civilians go to eastern congo either . 
  i mean , these are active war-zones . 
  french banks were fined from doing business with iran and sudan . 
  there was no war with iran . 
  only an embargo . 
  set an embargo with syria and stop doing friggin business with a regime that kills people . 
  if the army is telling you to be inside by 9 pm , they can arrest you for not going inside . 
  they dont have to prove that you did anything bad , they 'll simply lock you up . 
  and after you will be prosecuted . 
  if the military imposes a curfew in your country , and you dont respect it . 
  what will happen to you ? 
   politics are fluid , there 's not a switch which goes on/off , it 's about trends . 
  germans did not went asleep on the last day of the weimar republic and woke up surrounded by svastikas . 
  so the fn is a nazi party or they 're just waiting to turn france into nazi germany ? 
  uhm okay . 
  we 'll agree to disagree . 
  have a nice day . 
   civilians still live in those war zones , normal people with jobs and families . 
  it 's not like every square inch of the country is a terrorist training camp . 
  are you saying the 2000 + french 20-30yo , non-syrian males in peak physical condition left to visit family members ? 
  once the french foreign minister declares that all french nationals should leave an area , then anyone going into that area should be prosecuted . 
   that 's a bit of security that we all sacrifice for the knowledge maybe you are , but i 'm not certain the french wan na sacrifice that security . 
  lets put it this way : when the us was at war with japan , did they let japanese come into the us and walk freely amongts the population ? 
  oh wait , not they interned * even fuckin americans * . 
  i am ** not ** favorable for that treatment . 
  i am simply saying : are you a french national going to a war zone even though the french state declared you should leave ? 
  when you 'll come back you 'll be prosecuted . 
  if there 're a curfew during war-time , you can be prosecuted if you dont respect it . 
  it 's the same concept . 
  well of course not . 
  it 's not illegal . 
  but i am for changing the law . 
  and i feel many are also in favor of that . 
  wait , are you telling me about political parties or about extremist nationalists ? 
  extreme nationalists are like you 've mentioned the nazis and the neo-nazis . 
  are you saying the fn is a nazi/neo-nazi party ? 
  because they 're legal in france . 
  should we ban it ? 
  should we not let people vote for a ** legal ** party simply because we disagree with them ? 
   should people who return from ukraine spend the rest of their life in jail ? 
  it is a civil war . 
  if you want to return , we 'll have a problem buddy . 
  unless you actually have a business going there : msf ( was started as a french organisation afterall ) i 'm sorry . 
  civilians should n't go to war zones . 
  you were . 
   i 'm saying that nationalism is not the answer to what happened in paris that 's what you were saying . 
  so either : a ) nationalistic reactions happened and you 're telling people to calm the fuck down or b ) you are listing every item that is '' viable option to counter the current state of affairs . '', 
  i guess you 're telling us you 're doing option b ) then , let me help you list things that are `` not a viable option to counter the current state of affairs '' * wearing slippers * buying candles * playing portal 2 * making fajitas * improving your air guitar skills i guess we can all agree they are `` not a viable option to counter the current state of affairs '' . 
  they 're fun though . 
   aid workers go strawman much ? 
  you 're talking about qualified people going in to help . 
  what medical capabilities did these terrorists have ? 
   one of the suspect bomber 's father went to the `` war-zone '' to convince him to come back from syria . 
  well sorry . 
  that 's not how you deal with problems . 
  if my kid is taking hostages i dont push aside the police so i can talk to him . 
  the kid is now an adult and war-zones are off limits from civilians . 
   lebanese businessmen travel to and from syria all the time purely to conduct business the hell do i care about lebanese businessmen . 
  they should be told they 're not allowed on french territory . 
  how should i know they 're not doing business with terrorists ? 
  war is a lucrative environment . 
   family members go yes . 
  for a family reunion amidst bombs . 
  germany has a much larger syrian community than the french , yet many more frenchmen have left for syria . 
   ** we ** 're quite happy to ** allow thousands to die ** in the me , we 're perfectly fine to pretend we do n't know it 's happening . 
  can you tell me how i allowed that to happen ? 
  i did something horrible apparently . 
  what was it ? 
  what did / u/low _ discrepancy do ? 
   because we had no legal basis to do so . 
  it 's very difficult to prove any wrongdoings by people just going to ** suspicious foreign countries ** syria is ** more ** than a suspicious foreign country . 
  syria is a ** war-zone ** . 
  they went to a war zone . 
   it 's difficult to do more without jeopardizing fundamental principles . 
  going to a war-zone is a fundamental principal . 
  returning from a war-zone should be a one way ticket to jail . 
   i also believe the police units and judges dedicated to counter-terrorism have been understaffed and underfunded all the while the intelligence community was strengthened . 
  takes 18 people to follow a dude . 
  takes 3 hours to transcribe a phone conversation . 
  if you 've gone to a war-zone , you go to jail . 
  pretty sure it takes less than 18 people to send a dude to solitary confinement . 
   i 'm saying that nationalism is not the answer to what happened in paris can you give me any examples of nationalist reactions after what happened in paris ? 
   why should we think about the victims ?
