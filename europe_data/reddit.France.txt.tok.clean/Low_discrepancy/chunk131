   i did n't realize the 1990s were too old to be considered relevant anymore . 
  well who caused those 1990s terrorist attacks ? 
  [ armed islamic group of algeria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_islamic_group ) where were they formed ? 
  in algeria at the start of their civilian war that lasted from 91 to 02 . 
  that violence spills . 
  oh and you should know about about this terrorist group . 
  ahmed ressam , the guy who would have caused the lax bombing on ny eve 99/00 was connected to this group . 
  the french offered intel on them to the americans because they did n't know much about the group . 
  and guess with whom they were also connected ? 
  amazing when all this muslim extremism just connects . 
  a good first step : go against all wahhabists . 
  wait are you talking since the dawn of time ? 
  if so you 'll have to compile a list of terrorist attacks because no all have the same causes . 
  and french muslim population is significantly different from the german muslim population . 
  one 's of algerian origin , another of turkish origin . 
  there is a more painful history regarding algeria . 
  also algeria after independence has been much less stable than turkey . 
  those kinda of troubles also immigrate . 
  you can not mix everything in a pot and say well wtf ? 
  it does n't work like that . 
  also about 5 % of the german population is muslim . 
  in france it 's 7.5 % . 
  while the total population is about the same , germany has 15 million more people . 
  maybe this helps having fewer ghettoes and favors a mixing . 
  who knows ? 
  do you ? 
  of course france is n't perfect with integration . 
  yet no amount of troubles to integrate should translate into terrorism . 
  imagine if black panthers would have turned radical ? 
  what if malcolm x had pushed more for futher separation of the races ? 
  for forceful separation ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_the_united_states 2.77 million in 2010 . 
   germany has not been the victim of islamic attacks the way france , uk , spain , etc have been up until 2012 , france was n't the victim of terrorist attacks . 
  until then we could have asked why was only the us , the uk and spain ? 
  now we have to ask why the us , uk , spain , france , denmark , canada ... who else ? 
  and the minarets ? 
  well to show that a country can very stern towards muslims and still not have terrorist attacks . 
  well i think it 's the americans that love the roman example . 
  how its decadence caused its fall , blah blah blah . 
  so you want stats from european muslims ? 
  that can be achieved my friend . 
   https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3swujv/like_the_roman_empire_europe_has_let_its_defences/cx17jgp do you also want stats about french students that refused to hold a minute of silence after the charlie hebdo attacks ? 
  about 200 such cases in france . 
  and those were the ones reported . 
  many teachers would simply refuse to hold a mi ute in order to not cause problems . 
  most of the attackers spent some time in syria or yemen . 
  that was the case of nemmouche ( jewish museum attack ) , one of the kouachi brothers ( charlie hebdo attacks ) , one of the attackers from friday . 
  what do you suggest we do when they come back ? 
  per capita , french isis fighters are at the same level as australia . 
  belgium has twice as many per capita . 
  denmark has 75 % more . 
  switzerland ? 
  they banned the construction of minarets by referendum . 
  germany ? 
  as an american , i thought you 'd know about the hamburg cell . 
   stop mixing 1.6 billion people together . 
  255 million of those 1.6 billion muslims live in pakistan and egypt . 
   coldly and rationally . 
  is terrorism really wiping us out , more than , say car accident fatalities ? 
  so how many terrorists deaths is too much ? 
  per day ? 
  per year ? 
  tell me some numbers . 
  are you saying terrorist deaths are an inherent risk ? 
  like driving ? 
  i wan na hear some cold facts . 
  tell us . 
   is terrorism wiping us out more than it did last century , when most terrorists were white europeans ? 
  is terrorism wiping us out more than it did last decade ? 
  or two decades ago ? 
  well we had the largest terrorist attack in history , so does it help ? 
   what is the percentage of muslims in eu in total ? 
  why look at global statistics ? 
  are n't local stats more useful ? 
  more meaningful ? 
  the fact that we have more in certain areas than in other ? 
  the fact that many believe being french just means speaking french and having french friends ( heard on national tv by a somewhat mediocre french football player ) . 
   must be amazing feeling , 5 guys taking down an empire . 
  that 's ** not ** the friggin point . 
  the point is ** how many more ** ? 
  tell me some cold hard numbers . 
  how many extremists are living in thr eu . 
  how many ak47 ? 
  we can not turn back time . 
  but what are the next actions to take ? 
  several thousands of people that thought for isis might come back home . 
  what will we do with them ? 
  well egypt then ? 
  88 % of muslims in egypt are for the death penalty for apostasy . 
  65 % in pakistan . 
  i 'll have to report you . 
  i can not condone criminal activities . 
  did anyone pronounce that word ? 
  of course i can not accept any bribe . 
  of course . 
  anything for / r/girlsgonewild . 
  anything . 
  most also spent time in syria fighting for isis . 
  many also have double citizenship . 
  they 're very international .
