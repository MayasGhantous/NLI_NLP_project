  uhm per capita , france has 10 times more muslims than the us . 
  in absolute value , france has 2-3 times more muslims . 
  and that 's just france . 
  the amount of refugees germany just let in in one year ? 
  that 's about 80 % of ** all ** the muslims living in the us . 
   afaik they are better integrated in uk as well have you forgotten the 7/7 ? 
  look at the numbers and compare apples with apples . 
  what else would you do ? 
  and could you tell me in what city you live in austria ? 
  so i can give the correct info to the police . 
  :p you give the same arguments people against gun control . 
  it wont work . 
  it 'll just cost money . 
  it 'll just penalise the good guys . 
  the baddies will find a way if they want to . 
  i 'm not saying leaving schengen is the end all and be all to fix this situation . 
  i just believe it 'll be a good step in the right direction . 
  why are they letting people meet up ? 
  what 's wrong with the police ? 
  well knowing when they land on the soil , you send them to cool down for a few years in prison , that might help . 
   most likely the socialist party again , rinse and repeat . 
  the one that 's breaking up because they arent keeping their promises ? 
  time will tell . 
  signs are n't good though . 
   that 's why i 'd steal a license plate from a similar car if i were a terrorist . 
  or , fuck it , just steal a car that 's why , when your car gets stolen , you declare it to the police if you dont want to end up in deep problems . 
   anyone can rent a car which makes license plate checks pretty useless that 's why you stop and check every rented car . 
  how is that not an obvious solution . 
   btw , unrelated , i went from brussels to paris in 1997 on the thalys and was not checked at all . 
  was there some kind of open border between belgium and france before schengen ? 
  uhm schengen started in 95 . 
  a lot spent some vacation time in syria . 
  so no , in my book that does not make them french . 
  if you want , you can have them . 
  they do live in belgium either way . 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/15/world/paris-attacks/index.html well the results are in and do not look good . 
   but , nothing indicates so far that any of the terrorists from those last attacks were n't all french , and the previous attacks ( all 3 people in the january attacks , mohammed merah , . . ) were all french citizen too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_museum_of_belgium_shooting the guy was caught several days later in a random check in a bus station in marseille . 
  he had his ak 47 in his bag , he could have started another shooting anywhere . 
   for france , you have to deal with road traffic , and people simply walking across the border . 
  fine . 
  let them walk it . 
  no simply drive from one country to another unchecked . 
   but small roads and cross border walking traffic are going to be hell to resolve . 
  well let those people that want to cheat the system have problems . 
  let them pass through hoops . 
   those with an eu passport can go wherever they want , after all but you know when they arrive . 
   i think , financially , stopping shengen is not worth it . 
  it 's not a matter of if but when . 
  sarkozy is in favor of getting out of schengen and guess who the next president will be ? 
  http://www.lepoint.fr/europeennes-2014/exclusif-nicolas-sarkozy-s-exprime-dans-le-point-21-05-2014-1826581_2095.php without france , schengen will likely not survive a long time , spain and portugal will be disconnected . 
  a baddy from the middle east will have a much difficult time to arrive in france . 
   belgium uhm , what ? 
  they 're coming and going from belgium . 
  the guy that wanted to shoot up the thalys in august ? 
  he was coming from belgium . 
  in a eurostar that wouldnt have happened since bags are scanned . 
  bought their guns in belgium . 
  arrests ? 
   and yet , there were still terrorist attacks in the uk . 
  and i 'm saying that leaving schengen is a good idea . 
   honestly , only in extreme situations , when going to uk , i also had to show my id . 
  and my bags were scanned . 
  i had to be at the train station 30 mins before departure . 
  what special treatment did you obtain ? 
   the traffic even increasing there will not be in the forseeable future . 
  cameras that store every licence plate and photo of the driver . 
  if the car is rented , you stop it for a control . 
  if the car shows up near a hot spot , you 'll know where it entered . 
  machine learning has vastly improved since the good ol' days . 
  random checks from time to time . 
  nemmouche committed a terrorist strike in belgium . 
  several days later , a random check in the international bus station in marseille showed up a bag with an ak 47 . 
  so the guy shot up a jewish museum in bruxelles and was caught in marseille * with his gun * . 
  in what way is that safe ? 
   i have been a foreigner in france without the police knowing about a couple of times was there a risk of terrorist strikes when you visited ? 
  were you in a car that was involved in criminal activity ? 
  were you transporting a large group of people ? 
  were you carrying a large amount of goods that could be suspected to be counterfeit ? 
  uhm no because they check your id . 
  hence they 'll know if you 're an unwanted person and will refuse to let you in if you are . 
   uhm , freedom of movement in the eu means that millions of non-french citizens are about french soil without police knowledge . 
  nope . 
  uk has freedom of movement , yet when you go to the uk you still have to show id . 
  you 're mixing schengen with the eu . 
  it 's very difficult to discern any facts and conspiracy bs like the type you 're peddling is n't helpful . 
  if you do n't know , how about not commenting ? 
  that 's because you can not read . 
  the passport was found on the guy that blew himself at the stade de france . 
  edit : sauces http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/attentats-de-paris-un-passeport-syrien-retrouve-sur-l-un-des-kamikazes-du-stade-de-france-930135.html, 
  well it 's becoming more and more obvious that ** some ** terrorists were ** not french ** . 
  therefore you have foreigners on french soil the police knows nothing about . 
  is that a reassuring thought to you ? 
  so 55k came , 5k left and that 's comparable to what ? 
  1.5 m refugees from the syrian war ? 
  oh and lets not forget the hamburg cell that plotted 9/11 . 
   by this point two of the others suicide bombers have been identified as french i want sources for that . 
  the only fully identified suspect was from the bataclan hostage situation . 
  he was french and went to syrian between 2013-2014 . 
  it is not normal that he was n't in jail and it 's not fully sure he 's a terrorist suspect .
