   rally against the refugees thus creating further tension , there are n't a lot of refugees in france . 
  that 's the issue . 
  the guy came across the borders . 
  again . 
  the fact that the passport is or real does ** not ** matter . 
  i do not care if the person is turkish or iraqi or syrian or kuwaiti or bangladeshi or chinese or whatever . 
  that has no importance . 
  what matters is that a foreigner is on french soil without the police knowing about their existance . 
  such a thing is unacceptable . 
  because borders are open . 
  so quick question : where are they from ? 
  are the suicide bombers french ? 
  i highly highly doubt it . 
  they 're foreigners . 
  i dont care if they 're syrians , iraqi , chinese or from alaska . 
  they are foreigners on french soil committing terrorist attacks . 
  that is ** not ** normal . 
  we already have to deal with home grown terrorists and guns from belgium . 
  now foreign suicide bombers ? 
  fuck that . 
  fuck that so hard . 
  schengen must fall . 
  and will since sarkozy will win the 2017 election . 
  and he has spoken against schengen . 
   we 've had this situation in germany with refugees from kosovo . 
  how many kosovars did you let in ? 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is there are people on french territory that should n't be here . 
  the borders are open and that 's not normal . 
   but the passport is also very useful after their death , as it spreads fear of more terrorists arriving with the refugees . 
  well it clearly shows that we 've let people in and we do n't know who those guys are . 
  what will happen when the syrian war is over and those syrians/refugees/whatever that did n't manage to integrate will be asked to leave ? 
  well lets close the borders . 
  in france there are people that the secret services and police dont know about . 
  i dont know where they 're from . 
  they should n't go through borders so easily . 
   i am genuinely curious why a terrorist would spare the authorities that much work and carry his passport with him . 
  if he gets stopped by the police before getting to the destination , he would be forced to show id . 
  also he wanted to pass through the security at the stade de france . 
  also , why not ? 
  terrorists acts are all about * awareness * . 
  you have to spread a message and you have to show who the messenger is . 
  this is not some crime you want to escape from and move to some isolated island with an exotic beach . 
  it 's a suicide attack . 
  you want your name out there after the fact . 
  one of the terrorists was french born and fought in syria during 2013-2014 . 
  another had a syrian passport that was checked on lesbos in october . 
  we know things and lets act on those things . 
  someone that fought in syria should n't be able to walk freely . 
  nor should they be sent to jail with other normal inmates . 
  solitary confinement ? 
  encryption is a smoke screen . 
   it 's a big propaganda victory for isis that makes 0 sense . 
  so you think he 's not syrian . 
  then what is he ? 
  either way it shows that the refugee problem has been handled terribly . 
  a person went from syrian to paris unchecked . 
   this is just another part of isis 's plan : further disenfranchising european muslims when kids in schools refuse to hold a moment of silence after the charlie hebdo attacks , we can say that some people actively choose to not be part of society . 
  when french football player dhorasoo comes on national tv and says : yeah you do n't need to know the anthem to be french , you do n't need to know what the flag of france is to be french . 
  if you speak french and have french friends , you are french , we can see that for a certain group of people , being french means nothing in terms of values and beliefs . 
  these are people who separate from society by themselves . 
  kouachi were europeans . 
  nemmouche too . 
  the guy in the thalys probably had a resident permit . 
  we should stop kidding ourselves, 
   even though it is indeed very likely that 's how some of the terrorists entered france . 
  so how does this help the case for schengen ? 
   the police are still considering it being either planted or fake yeah , planted ... that makes super sense to anyone . 
  dude stop with the conspiracies . 
  the terrorists have no reason to lie . 
  2 days, 
  freedom of movement is guaranteed by the eu . 
   the dublin agreement is what failed , well in this case no it did n't . 
  the guy applied for asylum in lesbos where he landed in october . 
  then he merrily went across schengen states , never being checked at the border . 
  so in this case , dublin worked fine . 
  schengen failed terribly because you simply do ** not ** know who 's on your territory . 
  edit : i just realised there 's no connection between greece and other schengen states . 
  who fucked up this badly ?

   i am claiming that history supports the idea that if we provide a consistent example and give it time , people will assimilate . 
  do you disagree ? 
  what evidence can you come up with that supports your position ? 
  again you are talking in very abstract terms . 
  values , culture , ideas . 
  without ever giving examples ( and when you do , it backfires : the bretons , wtf ) . 
  so yes a value that has never been integrated by people : atheism . 
  all major states are secular . 
  we recognize that when religion at a large level imposes itself , it 's super bad . 
  and even at logical , personal levels . 
  believing that there 's an entity out there . 
  a super being that never shows itself . 
  that makes no sense whatsoever . 
  for a few hundred years we 've seen the massive benefits that the scientific method has brought to humanity and the world . 
  yet a huge part of people still think there 's a bearded guy in the sky . 
   the rest of your post is ignorant nonsense and/or has nothing to do with the question at hand . 
  i 'm telling you what 's happening in my country and you 're calling me ignorant ? 
  are you serious ? 
   let 's just focus on the central idea here : does culture change over time ? 
  dude , try to listen to your speech .
