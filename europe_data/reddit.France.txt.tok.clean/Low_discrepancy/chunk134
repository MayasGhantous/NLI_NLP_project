  you claim that our values are obviously better . 
  that there is objective measure that can declare that a culture is better than another . 
  and the only problem is that we have n't presented that objective measurement sufficiently well . 
  that the others are ready and willing to give up their culture and values for us , because we 're better and we got there . 
  or we can look at other cultures . 
  the chinese are happy with an illuminated dictatorship . 
  they do not want democracy , they want to live well . 
  look at the russians . 
  they will have lived 24 years unde putin by 2024 when putin can no longer run . 
  i simply realise that different people have different values . 
  and good fences make for good neighbors . 
  i realise that even people inside our culture can develop values that are different than ours , and they should move forward and in other country . 
  nobody in their right minds would want to fully close their borders . 
  but now we 've seen that schengen is an utter failure and we should terminate it . 
  if you 're not in schengen you can still control who is leaving and entering your country . 
  uhm . 
  one of the terrorists was a syrian that registered in october in lesbos . 
  clearly , schengen has big problems and will end in 2017 . 
  schengen will end . 
  sarkozy spoke against it . 
  he 'll be the next prez . 
  it 'll happen . 
  or maybe this guy :  https://youtu.be/veirmnitxj4 he cracks me up so much . 
   do you see the bretons as bretons or as french ? 
  do they see themselves as bretons or as french ? 
  bretons are just having a laugh . 
  do texans actually want to be independent ? 
  same thing . 
   that said , you have but to look around at the majority of immigrants to see that progress is being made . 
  well easier said than done . 
  every country has issues with integrating certain people . 
  again , you 're talking about theory that does n't apply in real life . 
  the us is facing immigration that wants to integrate , that wants a better life ** and ** its values are not significantly different from your own . 
  that 's not the case here . 
  we have immigrants that dont want you to draw mahommed , they want blasphemy laws in france , that have very skewed views towards gays . 
  and no , the muslims are n't those that get the worst treatment in france . 
  it 's the gypsies . 
  yet i dont see any gypsies taking up arms for syria . 
  this is a matter of ** values ** . 
  they view the west as a decadent society and decayed morals . 
  ask a mexican : so do you think the us is full of infidels ? 
   to sit there and essentially argue that people do n't change is to ignore all of the evidence around you . 
  uhm . 
  after 9/11 , after atocha , after charlie hebdo , in schools sole students refused to hold a minute of silence . 
  people would openly say : yeah charlie hebdo people deserved it . 
  wtf ? 
  i think you 're confusing the eu with schengen . 
  ha ha . 
  sucker . 
  i wonder who found the le terrible . 
  he 's the winner :(, 
  we got ta win hearts and minds . 
  how successful was that ? 
  what you are talking is good in theory . 
  the foreigners are little babies . 
  they just need to be shown how awesome we are and all the pieces will fall in place . 
  all be okay . 
  what we had was just a failure to communicate . 
  i 'm sure if we slowly explain how awesome the west is , they 'll immediatly accept homosexuals and drawings mocking mohammed . 
  because we 're awesome .

  teachers saying some students were defending the charlie hebdo terrorists http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/charlie-hebdo-que-faire-quand-des-eleves-defendent-des-terroristes_1639423.html in 2004 obin , school inspector was tasked by the minister of education to right a report about the state of secularism in schools . 
  he was talking about proselytism . 
  his report was put under the rug because , he says , was considered islamophobic . 
  http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2015/01/22/01002-20150122artfig00462-jean-pierre-obin-en-2004-notre-rapport-sur-l-ecole-nous-a-valu-d-etre-taxe-d-islamophobe.php here he declares : http://www.laicite-republique.org/jean-pierre-obin-en-2004-notre.html that the minute of silence after 9/11 and after atocha were not respected . 
   there are a few radicals among many people who are running away from them . 
  uhm ... a lot of french students refused to respect a minute of silence after the charlie hebdo attacks . 
  the same happened after 9/11 . 
  teachers would even stop bothering . 
  i 'll let you guess what was the origin of those students . 
  well the guy in the train said he simply found it in a park ... 
   what we need to do is to embrace our enlightenment ideals not just when it 's easy , but especially when it 's hard . 
  uhm , after 9/11 a lot of french students refused to hold a moment of silence in schools after the charlie hebdo attacks a lot of students refused to hold a moment of silence in schools . 
  i 'll let you guess the origing of those french students . 
  and we can look at some numbers . 
  france has about 5 million muslims . 
  at equivalent population , the us would have 25 million muslims . 
  10 times as many as today . 
  why dont you google how many fucking schools couldnt hold a minute of silence after the charlie hebdo attacks . 
  google the rapper booba that said charlie hebdo deserved it . 
  why dont you google how many students refused to hold a minute of silence after 9/11 . 
  a few are crazy people that commit terrorists attacks . 
  a lot are people who think are more muslims than french . 
  french officials are saying on one of the suicide attackers they found a syrian passport of someone born in 87 . 
  the person was n't know by the french secret services . 
  the guys that committed the january attack in paris bought their guns in bruxelles , the guy with the ak 47 in the train , got in belgium . 
  see my answer here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3son7s/windows_31_is_still_alive_and_it_just_killed_a/cwzthqk, 
  it 's a computer language widely used in scientific and engineering programming . 
  all major high performance libs : lapack , linpack , blas are actually implemented in fortran . 
  when you check what the top 500 super computers , the ranking is made by running those libraries . 
  it was developed in the 50 and continuously updated , but since it has such a long history , a ton of fluid mechanics , structural mechanics , climate modelling , etc etc code is written in fortran . 
  i mean the `` out of that prog lang fortran '' . 
  it 's a statement made by someone that never coded . 
  at the news , they said they shouted : `` this is for syria '' . 
  so yeah ... 
  nope . 
  gang members shoot themselves up . 
  these people are terrorists . 
  the places were this is taking place are really awesome , you can walk freely at midnight . 
  and on weekends it 's packed with middle class people , students , etc.
