   i do n't think that modern italians could easily claim romans as their own , but neither do i think that france should be limited to it 's post-1958 incarnation in that regard . 
  we 're entering again in political territory . 
  and congratulations on the strawman . 
  well lets look at history a bit . 
  the roman empire has a murky start . 
  but let 's say it 's centered around rome and some territories . 
  then it started expanding : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_conquest_of_italy as you can see from the link , it 's a conquest . 
  why would people that think of each other as equals have to fight wars to unite ? 
  and some tribes needed 3 wars ( over the span of 50 years ) to be convinced that they 're all italians after all . 
  but that 's just speculation maybe . 
  other tribes were refered as socii ( allies - associates ) . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socii like the samnites ( the tribe that fought 3 wars with the romans ) and another one some 200 years after those wars , in order to obtain roman citizenship . 
  this tribes lived in current day abruzzo , smack in the middle of italy . 
  they also spoke oscan ( a sister language of latin but not latin ) . 
  other languages were umbrian another language closely related to latin but not latin and written right to left . 
  or more interestingly , the messapii that lived in the heel of italy and spoke a language closely related to albanian . 
  looking at these difference , the fact the romans themselves refered to those other tribes that lived in italy as allies ( a weird term for people inside the same `` nation '' ) it would be unhistorical to claim than an italian identity existed at the time . 
   nation states , an important distinction , did too . 
  no they did n't . 
   in rome 50ad , somebody would have been recognised as a roman citizen or a foreigner ( or a slave or otherwise ) . 
  citizenship were just a series of rights that those in the roman state . 
  as the roman state extended , the citizenship was extended also . 
  the extension of the roman state in the italian peninsula was effectuated through ** a lot of wars ** : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_conquest_of_italy you can not claim you 're a nation when you extend your territory through war . 
  and the other tribes that lived in current day italy were considered allies ( socii ) and not roman . 
  for example the samnites that lived in current day abruzzo and didnt even speak latin but oscan . 
  they had to be convinced they 're `` italians '' through 3 wars . 
  ( we can mention other tribes such as umbrians that spoke again , not latin but umbrian ) . 
  citizenship was also extended , but it was simply a way to romanise the italic peninsula . 
  it did n't mean to say we 're one people . 
  they were still tribal . 
  and heck in 200 , roman citizenship is given across the roman empire . 
  are you saying the gauls were italian ? 
   establishing a proper national ancestry is the problem here . 
  but if any modern state was to bear it then it would be italy . 
  what you 're doing is not a historically coherent process . 
  you are applying modern day concepts to the past and you are simply doing a political process not a historic one . 
   it variates according to the nations , nations didnt exist back then . 
   the construction of nations as political entities . 
  that construction came much later . 
   my point is : for us french , it might seem weird as first to label italian , but it might be totally natural for italians in general these concepts of nationality , identity are very difficult to define even for people living nowadays . 
  how can you hope to extrapolate such a definition or concept to 2000 years ago . 
  culturally people living nowadays in italy are significantly different from those living during caesar 's time . 
  it might come natural for italians to say he was italian , just like it might come natural for some to say that charlemagne was french or whatever . 
  by making such claims that extend to 2000 years ago , a lombardian from milan is not italian . 
  how loved he is . 
  by 30k people ... 
  well nationalities nowadays are very linked to the concept of nation-states which themselves have come about in the last 2-3 centuries . 
  i 'll let capable historian develop why he can not be considered italian . 
  he 's not italian . 
  marie curie !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ polish ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ :d, 
  he was as much italian as vercingetorix was french , though . 
  slippery slope much ? 
  that 's like saying it 's no more flawed than having 1 % rule 99 %, 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_2015#results conservative party : 36.8 %, 
  and can you really say that poland is worse off for having those parades ? 
   those are blasphemy laws , not `` hate speech '' . 
  so you ` ce got blasphemy laws and you bitch about the west and how we restrict free speech ? 
   there is no such thing as `` hate speech '' in polish legal system . 
  the closest to that would be a constitutional ban on political parties postulating the totalitarian methods of communism . 
  nazism and fascism . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech_laws_in_poland yeah . 
   you sure love `` free speech '' . 
   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/7681981/pop-star-claims-bible-written-by-drunks.html  on 28 october 2005 , a provincial court convicted leszek bubel of violating article 257 of the criminal code by publishing anti-semitic literature . 
  the court sentenced bubel to a fine . 
  you 're not that different from france , germany , uk or other normal countries . 
  dont worry . 
  there will arrive a point when you 'll get fired from work for shouting homophobic stuff . 
  just like now you can get a fine for being an antisemite . 
  ( or for insult the bible , wtf poland is more restrictive on hate speech than france ) . 
   i 'm sure poland does n't require french welfare in order to function as a country . 
  i thought poland received eu benefits more than it contributed to its budget . 
  i guess i was wrong . 
  my bad . 
   oh , you would like to see people , whose beliefs you disagree with , `` weeded out of the job market '' ? 
  i dont have to like it . 
  it already is happening in any normal country . 
   or just that it 's you who speak about such things so casually nope . 
  hate speech will get your ass fired in france , uk , germany . 
  just try going to work and saying : darn those gays !, 
  lets see what happens , 
   so you 're afraid they 're gon na come to france and beat you up ? 
  i 'm also bothered that my tax money is going to people that have those beliefs . 
  i am not sure of poland is successful enough in weeding them out of the job market . 
   but the outcome of seats showed his support was much more widespread than labours god this is getting frustrating . 
  the outcome of the seats is the outcome of fptp system . 
  but that is ** not ** representative of the popular vote . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree because it 's getting silly here . 
  36 % of the votes got 51 % of the seats . 
  thats it, 
  because they 're in the eu and can freely cross borders . 
   creating a strong and stable government is . 
  i get it . 
  stability is more important than representation . 
  it trumps democracy actually . 
  good for you . 
  but lets stop claiming that uk loves cameron like he 's some sort of god while everybody else sucks donkey balls . 
  he got 6 % more votes than second place . 
   that 's the theoretical possibility ... cameron won 36 % of the popular vote and he has 51 % of the seats . 
  democracy everybody !,
