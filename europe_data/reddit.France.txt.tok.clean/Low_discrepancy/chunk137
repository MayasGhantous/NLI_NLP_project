  come on , just admit it . 
  36 % shouldnt give you a majority , ** ever ** . 
  if you 're 36 % then you should compromise to reach a majority . 
  if it doesnt represent the people , then you have a problem . 
  parliament should be a fair representation of the people . 
  you can make excuses as much as you want , but if 34 % of the people can dictate what the other 66 % should do , that 's a flawed system . 
  the cons severely outweigh the pros . 
   salaried workers ca n't hide so the problem is that tax evasion is huge in greece ? 
  i want to understand what 's a fair salary in greece , compared to the rest of the eu based on how strong its economy is and how well their government is working . 
  complaining that the starting salary is 900 euros doesnt tell anybody anything . 
   i do n't think the system is flawed , then go watch some cpgrey videos explaining why fptp is severely flawed . 
   when homosexuals are flaunting homosexual flags are they shitting on heterosexuals ? 
  stop with the strawmans already , so you agree that poland should have gay parades then . 
   how do you get catholic enclaves in a majority catholic society ? 
  if people identify more as catholics than as poles , or french or whatever , the you have a societal problem , the type that you mention . 
  homophobia nowadays stems from religious beliefs mostly , because in the french constitution or the polish i bet , there is no discrimination against the gays . 
   but judging by you missing atheist enclaves from the list atheists are a lack of religious belief . 
  it 's retarded to judge something by their lack , is n't it ? 
   in that case you seem to agree with the polish - social and cultural enclaves that are different from the majority are a problem . 
  does it mean i should warn my catholic/orthodox/muslim friends to avoid you , cause you might bash their skulls , by your own logic in the original what kind of logic is that ? 
  if 10000 poles want to move to france , not learn french history , or french and only speak polish , they will inherently have problems . 
  if 10000 saudi arabians do that , the same goes . 
  if 10000 poles move and learn the language , the history of france and accept its values ( secularism , republicanism ) of france ( which the majority of french maghrebians did and do ) then we 're fine . 
  same goes for 10000 saudis . 
   in that case you seem to agree with the polish - social and cultural enclaves that are different from the majority are a problem . 
  it 's a matter of ** values ** . 
  you did not prove to me that muslims are incapable of accepting polish values or french values . 
  prove to me that . 
  and we can continue . 
  so gays shouldnt organise parades . 
  interesting . 
  how democratic . 
   it was a strawman to begin with , and sexual orientation should be and is a private matter , period so then why are they flaunting heterosexual flags ? 
  im confused . 
  do you or do you nor agree that your system is flawed ? 
   did i say it is n't pathetic ? 
  well between a person that 's saying : * well muslims and gays should be judged on their behavior and not on who they pray to and who they fuck * and another person that declares * yeah gays shouldnt work close to children * you decide to reply to the first . 
  wtf ? 
   thus you made the equation of not wanting muslim enclaves into your society with being violent towards any single muslim who visits . 
  i dont want muslim enclaves , i dont want catholic enclaves , i dont want orthodox enclaves . 
   so now promoting family is shitting on different sexual orientations ? 
  maybe we should all become gay then to not shit on them , my bad . 
  holy strawman batman . 
  read what other polish said . 
   as for gays , if they do n't feel you 're flaunting it in their faces ( e.g. 
  by organizing gay parades ) , or if you 're not someone who closely works with kids , then again most wo n't mind with whom and what you do in the privacy of your home . 
  do you think that 's a normal idea ? 
   `` in this country a graduate starts off in the public sector with a salary of $ 775 a month , or $ 9,300 a year , and we are being told that wages will be frozen for the next decade and that every tax imaginable will be increased . 
  how will people make ends meet ? 
  it has got to the point where a social explosion is inevitable and it will come sooner rather than later . '' how do those wages compare with other ee countries ? 
  i mean in the last election it was clearly about opposition parties not making the case anything like as effectively as they could have and should have weird from the outside , it seemed like it was your retarded fptp system that gave cameron a majority . 
   ... and everyone they 've spied on . 
  and 1982 on sanchez pizjuan . 
  he didnt even get a yellow . 
  bastards !, 
   why do westerners always overdramatize things ? 
  lets see what another redditor , namely / u/roadside-strelok :  as for gays , if they do n't feel you 're flaunting it in their faces ( e.g. 
  by organizing gay parades ) , or if you 're not someone who closely works with kids , then again most wo n't mind with whom and what you do in the privacy of your home . 
  how 's that not `` fucking pathetic . 
  edit : i believe in judging people by their behavior towards me , not what god they pray to or who they sleep with . 
   it might be shocking for you but the majority of poles are against muslims . 
  and gays ? 
  i have quite a few muslim friends . 
  i should tell them that it is not safe to visit poland then . 
   the sacrifices and suffering endured to stop the genocides , to be allowed to speak their own language , to be a people , are worth honoring and celebrating . 
  does that allow them to shit on other people that have a different religion or different sexual orientations ? 
  edit : and since when are the dickheads that protest against muslims or gay couples a good representation of the whole of poland ? 
  you are mixing people that had no choice in being the way they are and people that did choose . 
  a black person is bust black . 
  they didnt choose , nor did gays or heterosexuals or even pedophiles or zoophiles . 
  they are what they are . 
  communists , catholics , atheists , thieves , child abusers , animal abusers chose and acted on their choice . 
  are you confused what the word irrational means ? 
  it means without reason . 
   when you may dislike some group of people and when you ca n't ? 
  you can dislike any group you want . 
  but dont expect to have job safety . 
  honestly , would you blame her ? 
   is this `` rule '' limited or maybe general in nature ? 
  im confused . 
  why does it bother you ? 
  are you a homophobe only if you stab gays ? 
   yes , because it 's not a valid analogy . 
  race is n't a sexual preference . 
  who gives a shit ? 
   when the monarch only takes a ceremonial role as head of state , there is very little difference between them . 
  well it 's anti-meritocratic . 
  personally i 'd be tired having someone in the public eye from birth to the moment they die . 
  caring about their marriage , about when they have kids etc etc. 
  it seems very weird . 
  i think we can both agree it 's archaic . 
  i understand : tradition ( and that kinda seems like its only advantage ) . 
  but if you start from a blank slate , it only makes sense to have a republic . 
   arguments are a part of every good love affair . 
  not in public though . 
  aversion to black people is irrational aversion . 
  aversion towards homosexuals is irrational aversion . 
   regarding your repeated suggestions that i have some dislike about black people : well , just no . 
  i dont know you nor do i care what your preferences are or arent . 
  i 'm just stating that the argument * it 's normal if you have an aversion towards homosexuals * is a homophobic comment because it is an irrational aversion .
