  hence homophobia . 
  i dont care if you dislike homosexuals or hate homosexuals . 
  you 're a homophobe . 
  ( a general you ), 
   she 's talking about population replacement - which of course only heterosexual couples can achieve . 
  and last time i 've checked , women in lesbian couples are still fertile . 
  to be checked . 
   chopping off rightful rulers heads is civilization so saddam was treated unfairly ? 
  til . 
  an ** irrational ** aversion is a phobia . 
  an aversion to black people is irrational . 
  does that bother you ? 
  the main idea behind a phobia is it 's irrational aspect . 
  not how strong the feeling is . 
  hey hey lets not shit on the miracle of dunkirk . 
  it 's a national moment of pride for them . 
  on a more serious note : both countries are in the same shit . 
  lets not sink to the level of chavs thoughs . 
  imagine kneeling in front of charles . 
  you mean uk will be last . 
  france second to last and germany either first if the president is hot or third to last if not ? 
  id vote if the offer is a drag queen or a crazy masked satanist . 
  indeed . 
  the circlejerk is stronk, 
  this guy gets it . 
  he 's british but still got it . 
   there is nothing somethingphobic in it . 
  phobia  a phobia is a type of anxiety disorder , usually defined as a persistent fear of an object or situation in which the sufferer commits to great lengths in avoiding , typically disproportional to the actual danger posed , often being recognized as irrational . 
  if you have an aversion to black people you 're a racist , aversion towards homosexuals , homophobe . 
  do words and their definition offend you ? 
  the white red hats those people are wearing look super ugly . 
  cant they find something more stylish ? 
  it makes just as much sense at that drawing . 
  what 's that ? 
  what 's so confusing about gay sex ? 
  i agree that money from the military would fix some problems . 
  i disagree that it means that you can not have both . 
  military spending and normal student tuition . 
  well as with the aca , things will have to get worse in the us , before they get better . 
  but i think once you have enough people on bord , you 'll be able to change the laws . 
   some of that is probably just different bookkeeping . 
  well different bookkeeping has different effects . 
  they 're not all equal . 
  someone with debt will behave differently than someone who pays taxes . 
  though the level of taxes a german will pay is not significantly different than the one paid by an american . 
  before you tell me that an american will get a higher salary , well the gdp per capita is about 15-20 % higher in the us . 
   i 'm speaking on behalf of myself and no one else . 
  well i misread your comment . 
  i read it like a whole `` well we got ta keep the world safe '' type of argument . 
  i still dont think military spending is the answer to your problems . 
  it 's simply a bubble . 
  as long as people will pay out of their noise for the degree , tuition will increase . 
   there 's nothing wrong about having an aversion to same-sex relationships . 
   there 's nothing wrong about having an aversion to black people . 
  sounds weird does n't it ? 
   what does her comment have to do with the cartoon ? 
  the cartoon may be supporting heterosexuality but that does n't necessarily mean it 's homophobic . 
  just another parallel point of view . 
  lets change it then . 
  lets put this drawing  black ? 
   asian ? 
   white !!!, 
  wouldnt it be cringe worthy ? 
   i did that in order to please certain ** international ** gay lobby groups . 
  wtf, 
   we do n't fund our universities so they wring the money out of students . 
  yes , tell me more how ivy leagues are underfunded . 
  yet they dont reduce their tuition . 
  and how many kids go to community college ? 
   infrastructure spending ? 
  well the companies doing that can very well be foreign ( just look at the case of railways and rolling stock which can be from bombardier or alstom ) . 
   does n't really mean much when it was spent to build a tank that will never leave its warehouse . 
  how 's that the fault of the eu or whatever ? 
  honestly no one forced you guys to go into iraq for example . 
  you 're like the smoker complaining about the cost of ciggs . 
  nobody is forcing you . 
  you spent waaay waaay waaay more money on iraq than in lybia . 
   different socio-economic classes in the uk are impacted in different ways ( some professions are much more exposed to competition than others )  housing costs are increased massively  infrastructure is overstretched  social cohesion is impacted well if eu immigration bothers you , you know how to vote . 
   built up pension liability i 'm confused , are n't they paying for their pensions ? 
   and assumes the migrants will leave the uk before they get old and start getting ill . well it 's looking at the past and not the future . 
  they are n't making any forecasts and saying that in 60 years migrants will have brought x billion to the economy . 
  they might get some british habits rubbed on them and move to spain once they 're old . 
   study in europe and go back to ` murica it 's not like salaries are smaller in the eu because of taxes and our filthy socialist state . 
  the us is simply richer ( about 10-20 % more gdp per capita compared to the uk , france , germany ) . 
  you can move to switzerland and make much more money than in the us . 
  that 's because the us 's gdp per capita is about 20 % greater than then one in the uk , germany or france . 
  so actually , the ** us is richer than big eu countries ** . 
  you wouldnt be surprised if i were to tell you you 'd have a higher salary in germany compared to poland . 
  0.26 freedom gallons . 
  or 2.6 iraqi freedom gallons ( because in that country freedom was only about 1/10th as effective, 
  but uk made a net 20 billion benefit from eu migrants . 
  so i wouldnt be too upset if i were you . 
  what does student debt have to do with army spending . 
  also defense spending is the best possible type of govt spending since companies can not outsource ( your planes will not be built in china ) and you arent even allowed to hire foreigners . 
  so that sweet sweet govt dollar stays in your national economy . 
  it 's the 1.2 trillion student debt that our poor euro brains dont understand . 
  at equivalent population , in france that would be a debt of 250 ** b ** illions . 
   i 'd get booted out of belgium if i went over for 6 months and could n't support myself . 
  but in france you can still apply to get housing benefits and if you 're a student you can apply for scholarships at crous . 
  so why does the uk want special treatment ?
