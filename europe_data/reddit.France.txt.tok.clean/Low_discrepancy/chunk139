   countries should try to accept only immigrants that make a significant net positive contribution . 
  dont these workers get benefits if they already worked in the uk ? 
  it 's not like they get insta-unemployment . 
  also eu immigrants provided net benefits to uk . 
  it almost looks like porn how well everything fits, 
   i feel like an institutionalised digital voting system would work very well here . 
  a few issues a year , everyone goes to the local button office and signs in , pushes a few buttons , and make their voices heard that way . 
  cause fuck talking to strangers . 
  are the police the only govt organisation that is understaffed and underpaid in sweden ? 
  how about social workers , teachers , etc ? 
   you can be deprived of your nationality on the basis of your involvement in a terrorist organization . 
  not in france . 
  thats what i was suspecting ... 
   us most people think that majority of countries budget goes to nasa so that huge ass military , that huge ass infrastructure and teachers , doctors etc. . . americans think their salary does n't take a big chunk ? 
   un conventions , human rights bullshit and such ... 
  it 's already the friggin principle of it . 
  you do n't make people stateless . 
  lets not return to the dark days of ww2, 
   should the eu ever decide that germany is the primary place where we should spend resources for development that would happen simply by the fact that they have more people . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  germany does n't have a majority in the parlament . 
  also that 's silly . 
  germany is a net contribuitor to the eu budget . 
   additionally the votes in the council of the eu are proportional to the population of a country . 
  in the parlament of serbia , does belgrade get the same number of seats as novi sad ? 
  if people get less funding in novi sad and it starts sucking , they 're forced to move to belgrade . 
   the commission is indirectly elected , which is what i disagree with the most . 
  do you directly elect your govt ? 
  so why would the eu be any different ? 
  you dont want power to the people in the eu . 
  you want power to serbia , which is undemocratic . 
   you seem to be all talk and no evidence , please , write in some evidence as to why we should bother ? 
  in 1997 , the gdp per capita of bulgaria was about ** 2.5 ** times smaller when compared to serbia . 
  in 2013 , bulgaria 's gdp is 20 % ** smaller ** . 
  compared to bulgaria , you went from ** +2500 % ** to ** -20 % ** . 
  in 2003 ( so after the war ) . 
  the gdp per capita of serbia was slightly larger than the gdp of romania . 
  in 2014 , romania 's gdp per capita is about 10k and serbia about 6k . 
  that is 40 % smaller . 
  oh and lets not compare with poland . 
   why would you want us ? 
  that 's weird . 
  i heard the same question from a serbian friend . 
  do you think the future of the eu depends on whether serbia joins or not ? 
  honest question . 
  do you think the future of your children will depend if serbia joins or not ? 
  romanian , bulgarian and polish kids live better now , even though in 2003 , romanian and serbia people were about as wealthy . 
  and in the future the gap will only continue to increase . 
  but hey serbia stronk !, 
  serbia is more important than the serbians and how they live . 
  neither is uk then , nor germany , nor canada , nor denmark , nor norway , nor sweden ... 
  the list goes on and on and and on . 
  do you think a constitution protects your free speech ? 
  ask the japanese during ww2 , ask the blacks during segregation , ask the blacks during the slavery period . 
  and france is a republic so yeah . 
  nothing . 
  he missed an olympics because of politics . 
   well they 're immigrants , so we ca n't hold them to the same standard as normal people apparently there are people , whom i never met , that say that the law system should be more lenient to immigrants . 
  i have yet to see such people though . 
  edit : uk never ceases to prove me wrong . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diamonds_affair https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_oil_sniffer_hoax and if greece got into the eu with all its problems , well you have vge to thank . 
   we count france out of pretty much everything these days . 
    syrian refugee crisis and for that we thank you . 
   many small ( tiny even ) countries okay . 
  count france out of that military schengen . 
   romanian mario monti oh god , i hope not . 
   french president valery giscard d'estaing . 
  now that 's a regrettable politician . 
  okay that 's your belief , mine is different . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
   to the predictable defense that he was talking about rioters , who are not just any individuals , those israelis were referencing the killing of enemy soldiers and rioters , not innocent arabs . 
  so calling rioters `` racaille '' is the same as this :  bennett : `` if you catch terrorists , you have to simply kill them . ''  amidror : `` listen , that 's not legal . ''  bennett : `` i 've killed lots of arabs in my life -- and there 's no problem with that . '' your former minister of economy , that de-facto declares that he has carried out the capital punishment ** outside of the judicial system ** . 
  and condones it . 
  notice he says that if you ** catch ** them . 
  so once caught and neutralised , he is for killing them . 
  those are not values i want to associate with . 
  yes i agree that france has a shameful past . 
  why deny it for jingoistic reasons . 
   nah , it 's just that you have ** citizens ** of different entities living in their respective places . 
  what friggin citizens . 
  palestine is not a state so they can not have a palestinian citizenship . 
  they 're given a dummy passport but no citizenship . 
  anyone who is against the two state solution is effectively for colonisation . 
  my values are against colonialism . 
  end of discussion . 
  how do we know that this is true and not some karma baiting ? 
  edit : crazies ** do ** teach ( from bialystok ) . 
  since it is topical , i 'll quote max bialystock from the producers :  that 's our hitler !, 
  sauces in this comment by / u/lekiouses : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3sb7sc/this_is_an_actual_homework_a_middle_school/cwvpnvp apparently , you ** can not ** make up shit like this . 
   drawing attention to the absurdity of the law the majority of the french are not in the streets demanding to change the law , so ... fail ? 
   try growing up and stop forcing your will onto others . 
  people should follow the laws of their land . 
  if i dont agree with a law , i dont try to break it . 
  i try to change it . 
  m'bala * 2 should lobby not break laws . 
  the us has its laws , france has its ones . 
  i hope you understand why your values are not exactly mine and why a diversity of political systems is a good thing . 
  i am simply explaining that telling 500k french citizens that they should pack up and leave to the us or canada is stupid . 
  they 're french . 
  they speak french .
