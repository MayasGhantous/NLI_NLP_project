  what do you expect ? 
   drew the borders with his eyes closed and then awarded those territories to the hungarians . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary_in_world_war_ii#/media/file:hungary_1941_ethnic.svg yeah that 's what happened . 
  see that huge romanian blob that got absorbed by hungary . 
   this could have been easily solved in a peaceful way yeah . 
  peaceful . 
  if not for ee 's resistence , half of europe would be muslim now . 
  huh ? 
  you realise they got up to vienna right and that austria is n't part of ee . 
   whenever something happens everyone looks at the americans in unison . 
  in the case of an actual invasion yeah . 
  in the case of mopping things up and fixing things , not really , the us and russia are simply too entrenched against one another ... 
   a proof that can not be followed is no proof at all . 
  tell that to the people that brute forced and used computer proofing to tackle kelper 's conjecture . 
  it is not a theorem . 
  and computers do n't really care about quality of exposition . 
   if you have horrible exposition , the best article in the world wo n't help you . 
  tell that to the people that wrote [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/linear-quasilinear-elliptic-equations-ladyzhenskaya/dp/0124110290/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1460719980&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=linear+and+quasilinear+elliptic+equations ) . 
  yes it 's a book but it 's one of the most important books in elliptic pde theory because of the sheer quantity of ** innovative ** material / new theorems . 
  but it 's so annoying to read because the proofs are given before the theorems are stated so you do n't really have any clear vision of where things are going . 
   in mathematics , exposition is the result . 
  as such , there is no distinction . 
  no it is not . 
  your correct proof is the result . 
  you can ** not ** take a shitty article , transform it into a nice new clear expos\u00e9 and pass it off as your own because * shit will hit the fan * . 
   added the article . 
  the important part that lead to the controversy , emphasis mine : i see you are hung up on this thing . 
  i do n't see why not mention what else happened : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifold_destiny#revision_of_the_cao.e2.80.93zhu_article  on december 3 , 2006 , cao and zhu ** retracted the original version of their paper ** , which was titled `` a complete proof of the poincar\u00e9 and geometrization conjectures -- application of the hamilton -- perelman theory of the ricci flow '' [ 2 ] ** and posted a revised version , renamed , more modestly ** , `` hamilton -- perelman 's proof of the poincar\u00e9 conjecture and the geometrization conjecture '' they retracted their paper and changed the title * and * the abstract :  rather than the claim of the original abstract , `` we give a complete proof '' , suggesting the proof is by the authors , the ** revised abstract ** states : `` we give a detailed exposition of a complete proof '' . 
  the authors also took out the phrase `` crowning achievement '' from the abstract . 
  i 'm sorry but this is serious business . 
  while a shitty expos\u00e9 might not get your article published and it would just remain on arxiv , passing of someone 's results as your own just because you improved the expos\u00e9 is a serious problem . 
  of course we 're not all perelmans and whatever , we 're just normal people so quality of presentation is very important because people wo n't read your work otherwise , claiming that it is mathematics is just intellectual dishonesty . 
   as such , if a scientist was funded while working on it or gaining the experience , that information is also a public good . 
  i bet if we were to look at wages as a function of work hours many scientists would end up working under minimum wage . 
  just because they get paid a pittance does n't mean they should endure every little shit . 
  10-15 % as royalties is n't that friggin exceptional . 
  ** and now to the meat of my comment ** . 
   therefore i reject the notion that one can use your proposed distinction as a means to separate papers and books . 
  you again refuse to understand the difference i make . 
  an article is judged by its innovation . 
  if a shitty article is written but it has the theorem i need , i still have to go through it , painful line by painful line because i have to cite it . 
  it has the result , i can not avoid it . 
  if a shitty book is written , i 'll just get a different book because screw that . 
  ** the main point ** i believe access to information should be free , but convenience should be paid for . 
  books still are about convenience / . 
  when you start learning a new thing , you go to a book not to the most important article in that area . 
  much like freeware vs paid software . 
  windows is much more convenient than linux . 
  gui for example , that 's smth you should pay . 
  ides that 's something you should pay . 
  a compiler that 's not something you should pay for . 
   first of all , there are plenty of articles which are 50-100 , or even 100 + pages long . 
  yes dude there are * some * long articles and * some * short books . 
  that 's not the point here . 
   in general , articles should have high quality exposition , you missed the point . 
  the point is an article has to be about the result , usually a very small and precise area . 
  but again it 's about the result . 
  if your article is n't sufficiently innovative , the best exposition in the world wo n't help you . 
  if your exposition is shit , people will still have to dig through it if it is innovative . 
  a book on the other hand is about the style and impressions of the author on a given large area of knowledge . 
   high quality exposition & nbsp ;  a well-done exposition these are not styles . 
  these are qualities . 
  a style is the personal print of the author on the topic at hand . 
   it is also why the best and most well-cited articles are usually very well written , so much that you could publish them as a book . 
  correlation does not imply causality . 
  the most quoted articles still are the ones that have the most impact and have a high degree of novelty . 
  frankly perelman did n't even write articles yet we still give him the fact that he proved the poincar\u00e9 conjecture . 
   neoliberal #triggered . 
   feminism has made women more masculine and emasculated males , i am pretty sure this plays a factor in fertility . 
  surely you performed some statistical , demographical , sociological analyses on this matter so i 'll believe you . 
   reprimand be damned . 
  [ you might get a combat action ribbon man  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_vincennes_ ( cg-49 \\ ) #awards _ and_decorations ), 
   if russia is willing to violate the 1970s agreements , then it 's time we stop honoring them too and play `` dirty '' like russia . 
  sad that people like carlin with his [ bigger dick foreign policy ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jmwxr-1oaje ) are dead . 
  but at least obama is on the right side of history . 
  let 's tone down the warring . 
  nothing good ever came of it in 70 years since the nazis fell . 
  let 's focus on the economy . 
   nope , but is it better than an alternative hegemony ? 
  probably so , imo . 
  is a us hegemony preferable to a polarised world ? 
  well that 's a moot point with china growing on the global scale . 
   there has been pretty much zero effort by the finnish government to increase births of native finns do n't they give a cardboard box and some diapers ? 
  what more can you ask ? 
   other countries who do n't spend much on research would just get even freeer access to eu research payed by eu tax money . 
  yes but our countries do n't make money from putting articles behing a pay wall . 
  rendering these free would vastly help european countries that can not afford to tax students 40k per year to study . 
  meaning the libraries of these countries can not really afford to pay the subscriptions . 
  everybody loses from paywalling articles . 
  everybody either wins or is neutral if we render them free . 
   edit : for example . 
  that is dishonest . 
  the vast majority of books cost a fraction of that . 
  it 's usually around 100-150 . 
  books represent a long process . 
  while i agree that articles should be freely available , i believe books are a different story . 
  a great amount of effort goes into making those books , the quantity of material is vastly larger and the researcher 's personality and quality of exposition is far more important . 
  she can make some money from selling the books . 
  an article is just about the result and its correctness . 
  we all benefit if we know the results .
