  their parents speak french , their grandparents speak french . 
  their friends speak french and they 're french citizens . 
  yes tragedies have happened 75 years ago . 
  and this year . 
  yes its disgusting but the vast majority are french and they belong here . 
  they 're not some friggin nomads . 
  what you think about france or do not think , why should i care ? 
   floated the idea of a kind of military schengen , to allow a freedom of military movement . 
  so having armies passing across borders without asking or announcing the country they 're going into ? 
  did i understand this correctly ? 
  france = somalia . 
  holy strawman , batman !, 
  this being the 21st century , there are means of efficiently collecting information about distant places and formulating reasonable opinions . 
  yes . 
  the media will always present an unbiased view . 
  here you are correct . 
  okay . 
  so you 're the type of person that talks out of their ass . 
  good day, 
  it is comparable to the segregation of the 60s . 
  do n't remember sarkozy labeling minorities scum , sauces . 
  people living in the west bank are not israeli citizens , do n't desire to be , and are not entitled to the rights of citizens . 
  a great deal of that is on the shoulders of their own leadership , who have shit the bed . 
  so the colonization of the west bank is the fault of the arabs . 
  darn that sweet sweet propaganda . 
  ever lived in france ? 
  are you claiming that french citizens are n't well protected . 
  yes very sad things did happen , but it 's not just fns job to protect citizens . 
  that being said , after the muslims are kicked out of france . 
  who do you think will the next target be ? 
  this is what extremists do : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came_ ... 
  the party is still full of batshit crazy people . 
  a person that was running for the council in a city for the fn put on fb of a baby monkey and under the text * 18 months * . 
  and next to the monkey photo , a photo of taubira ( minister of justice which happens to be black ) and under her photo the caption * now * . 
  wtf  ) and no it 's not an isolated case . 
  http://www.liberation.fr/france/2015/02/27/islamophobie-homophobie-la-compilation-des-derapages-fn_1210335 it 's epic :d, 
  trollers got ta troll ^ troll ^ troll . 
   unless there is a fundamental change of attitude on the arab side so there is n't any colonisation and settlement of the west bank ? 
  thanks man . 
  i didnt know the media was lying to me . 
  first of all , the term `` guilty '' does not suit a sincere political discussion , in this context it is only polemic . 
  wait ? 
  am i supposed to be sincere ? 
  okay . 
  i dont care about israel nor do i care about palestine . 
  really . 
  id rather have better traffic conditions here , than peace in israel and palestine . 
  what if i told you i had a sarcasm tag , 
  you only have to pour over thousands and thousands of previous cases . 
  lawyers becoming hyper important -  hence lawyers suggesting you should always sue . 
  then again i 'm no law expert , or even a layman . 
  i 'll take the comments that state which is clearly better than another with a pinch of salt though . 
  in france le pen daughter is using the jewish to blame the muslims ( look at how muslims attack the jewish , obviously we need to protect the jewish and stop muslim immigration . 
  the funny thing : le pen le dad bashed the jewish all his life . 
  and now he 's like super confused and still bashes them . 
  ( old habits die hard ) . 
  until he was banned from his own party . 
  so we agree then . 
  we should unify legislation before company from country x should start selling in country z. 
   russian athletes said nothing against doping during last years ? 
  i dont think that fair . 
  we should n't ban people because they were n't whistleblowers . 
  i just dont want people like sergey bubka to miss one out ( like he once did ) because of shitty events they had no control of . 
  all ** clean ** athletes should participate . 
   they do have good systems actually . 
  well okay . 
  if you think the system in belize or cayman is a good system , then we are in profound disagreement . 
  you want a race to the bottom where no company will pay their taxes anymore . 
  thanks but not thanks . 
  i want the laws that protect citizens . 
  cash cows should be milked or they die from getting bloated . 
  what 's exceptional about the us is the irs . 
  to introduce backdoors ? 
  thank god no . 
  though lets face it . 
  doping in east germany was super well known . 
  and the soviets were not strangers to it . 
  banning a whole federation is a bit odd and you penalise quite a few people that might be innocent . 
  have drug tests and if they fail , ban them . 
  i bet there will be 2-3 posts declaring the french arrogant . 
  omg how dare they refuse to not drink wine . 
  and it 's fairly standard to include the country where the insurer and insured are based ( in the vast majority of cases , it 's the same country ) . 
  so you dont need to know the law system of 27 other countries . 
  are you telling me it 's better for me to learn the laws of 27 countries when i apply for car insurance ? 
   just to clarify , criminal law should be national . 
  so insurance scams should be dealth in which country again ? 
  that 's not a civil court law . 
   . if you want to make french law be used more widely , the answer is to make french law better , rather than try to make english law worse . 
  are you saying the best systems in the world are cayman islands and belize ? 
  because that 's where every company wants to put they hqs and that 's where they want to pay taxes . 
  but hey . 
  even here i 'll agree with you . 
  lets not change insurance and bank laws . 
  if uk has really good prices , fine . 
  but if french insurers go broke ans unemployed . 
  then there should be a centralised unemployment system and social protection system . 
  if you take money from my pocket , you should pay taxes and protect the people in my country , because you 're taking ** my ** money . 
  and fine , i agree to use the uk social security system ( uneployment , etc ) . 
  and every country should copy the uk system and uk should contribute according to the profits it made to this european social security system . 
   law is also a service that can be exported globally after all and the uk should try to export it globally .
