  the thing that foreign investors want is a reliable stable political class and a non-corrupt system . 
  they want transparency . 
  cheap labor they can get in morocco or china . 
   do n't wan na join the eu because of kosovo and the constant new terms and conditions well are they unreasonable , those terms ? 
  or are they more : oh yeah . 
  makes sense what they want ? 
  they also want a lot of reduction of corruption . 
  do you think your own politicians will fight to reduce corruption ? 
   we fought and bled to keep for centuries i can imagine that a lot of people dont particularly like those visas to stay in the eu . 
  sorry , i tried but my patience ran out . 
  balkan started ww no 1 . 
  ww no 1 best ww . 
   actually , i think most people now do n't wan na become eu members . 
  you can see how much harm the eu did to poland or romania . 
  poland 's gdp is quite high and salaries have increased , romania has gotten good at tackling major corruption cases . 
  who wants that ? 
  from the bare island , i wan na go eat some carpet on grazing land but only if it does n't smell like the fish house . 
   they will just argue for a long long long time thats why we like you guys, 
  the balkans is the pettiest region in the world . 
   finally a good decision , good job . 
  if serbia want into the eu , it 'll have to let kosovo go at some point and get over it . 
   but europe has already closed its eyes of course . 
  i dont want pepper spray in my eyes, 
   you can have both or you can have none , everything else is hypocrisy . 
   nato is , however , and most nato members use the treaty as toilet paper . 
  well name names man . 
  how are those stats compared with the rest of the regions in spain ? 
  edit : i mean poverty , unemployment , debt rates . 
  just report him for mindless circlejerk . 
  no need to insult . 
  or let the downvotes bury him . 
   commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the ** north atlantic treaty organisation ** , which , for those states which are members of it , ** remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation ** . 
   and/or eu collective defense responsibilities the eu is not a defense organisation . 
  it is n't meant to re-unite armies . 
  just ask your little friend uk ~ ~ is ~ ~ if they want that . 
  europe never had a joint asylum policy . 
  just like europe hardly never had a joint external policy . 
  so i do n't understand the :  given the historically central role france has played in hashing out these kinds of decisions alongside germany when france intervened unsuccessfully in lybia , it did n't ask germany , when it intervened successfully in mali , again it did n't ask germany . 
  and in the case of the greek crisis , well france , as the article mentions , did push for greece to remain in the eurozone . 
   i do n't think the effectiveness of the solutions was really being discussed so you discuss solutions without analysing how successful they were ? 
  i see deep down you are french . 
  first the article literally starts with how ofpra couldnt fill some buses in munich because france is n't appealing to refugees . 
  then it has this nugget :  first the greek currency drama , now the refugee crisis -- france has found itself increasingly marginalised : at best a junior partner to mrs merkel , at worst a mute spectator the point of the article is to show how france was irrelevant in the resolution of the two current crisis . 
  what this article does n't show : how friggin awful those two crisis were `` solved '' . 
  we 're accusing france of everything and its opposite nowadays . 
   when i totally agree with you and the article , what would have been a massive french involvent in the refugee crisis ? 
  800k refugees on french soil ? 
  how would that have been a success story for us ? 
   first the greek currency drama , now the refugee crisis -- france has found itself increasingly marginalised : at best a junior partner to mrs merkel , at worst a mute spectator so how were those two crisis handled ? 
  are they successful ? 
  france will be a mute spectator when germany will be capable of handling massive issues ** successfully **, 
  an economist article that bashes hollande . 
  say it is n't so . 
  i am shocked . 
  this is unprecedented . 
  sources for how gmail isnt ecrypted . 
  move with the times with rfc 5321 . 
   also you should be less of a pompous cunt so you can learn something you present 0 sources on how anyone can read gmail emils and just point towards old smtp protocols . 
  while i 'm telling you about ssl which is used to protect those smtp connections . 
  but hey , keep insulting . 
  this is getting tiresome . 
   i still do n't really understand how it relates to the canned `` food '' , but it is what it is . 
  it actually related to monty python . 
  cs people are like that . 
  also little endian and big endian has its funny sources . 
   you do n't even understand what you 're reading . 
  sources or stfu, 
   in addition , ** every single email message you send or receive -- 100 percent of them -- is encrypted while moving internally ** . 
  this ensures that your messages are safe ** not only when they move between you and gmail 's servers ** , but also as they move between google 's data centers -- something we made a top priority after last summer 's revelations . 
   https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.fr/2014/03/staying-at-forefront-of-email-security.html you should email google and tell them you 're better than them . 
  i am . 
  who knew monkeys were so organised . 
   you could split him in half but the flemish will say that 's the french way of treating royalty and will refuse . 
  terrorists by definition want to spread terror . 
   i ca n't even begin to describe how ignorant you are . 
  thats because you dont understand how https works . 
  only google has the private key to decrypt the data it received . 
   http://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/  1 . 
  what is https and what does it do ? 
   https takes the well-known and understood http protocol , and simply layers a ssl/tls ( hereafter referred to simply as `` ssl '' ) encryption layer on top of it . 
  servers and clients still speak exactly the same http to each other , but over a secure ssl connection that encrypts and decrypts their requests and responses . 
  the ssl layer has 2 main purposes :  verifying that you are talking directly to the server that you think you are talking to ensuring that only the server can read what you send it and only you can read what it sends back  ** the really , really clever part is that anyone can intercept every single one of the messages you exchange with a server , including the ones where you are agreeing on the key and encryption strategy to use , and still not be able to read any of the actual data you send . 
   it is still plain text once it leaves the mail server . 
  http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/8145/does-https-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks-by-proxy-server you obviously do n't know what https is and how it works . 
  should n't this be in / r/upliftingnews, 
   99 % of email is plain text . 
  i and that plain text is encrypted . 
  that means not every govt agency can read what you 're sending . 
  none of which is normal . 
  it 's not normal for the french govt to collect my data . 
  nor is it normal to collect the data of americans or whatever . 
  no citizen can claim that this is a win, 
  are you saying that italy taps on gmail servers ? 
  i would love a source for that . 
  that looks way too choreographed . 
  if that is the traditional dance , what 's stopping the irish from saying riverdance is their traditional one . 
  look how high i can jump . 
  now look i 'm a little person . 
  exactly . 
  so why take them ?
