  the outrage against having eu citiens being spied upon should n't stop . 
  be it by their govts ( as it might happen soon with the french govt ) or by foreign govts ( nsa , gchq ) . 
  a stasi or securitate regime should ** not ** become the norm . 
  normal citizens should n't be spied . 
  for the last 14 years , the terrorists have n't stopped winning . 
  civil liberties have been constantly reduced . 
  mass surveillance has increased . 
  true . 
  but why is the nsa spying on my emails ? 
  i 'm not a member of the french govt . 
  i 'm just a regular citizen . 
  i am not outraged my govt was spied by the germans or americans . 
  but my personal emails are stored in nsa databases . 
  that kinda bothers me . 
  why are people bothered by the stasi or securitate ? 
  where do you draw the line though ? 
  german literature is better in german . 
  same goes for italian , spanish , russian , japanese . 
  and i love the word * pourriel * . 
  it 's kinda like a shitty contraction . 
  that 's why i love it so much . 
  spam would n't mean anything to a non-english speaking person . 
  that being said : in english free-running is somewhat used more often than parkour . 
  so we 're not the only guilty party . 
  i mean to what not where . 
  but you mean to say you dont an indoor toilet ? 
  my bad . 
  beating the bishop . 
  chocking the chicken . 
   most old houses are made of bricks , mud bricks . 
  yeah what did people pull the bishop to back in the day in your bathroom ? 
   i grew up in the french system and i 'm 31  show me a french person who can go to a neighbouring country without constantly mocking it . 
  so why do you sound like / r/im14andthisisedgy  how modern italy generally matches french economic output and has similar standards of living , i was talking to a recent italian uni graduate . 
  he was starting a a new job . 
  french with his qualifications would win 40-50 % more . 
  we 're not twice as good compared to italians . 
  we 're just 30-40-50 % better . 
  and that 's enough   . and this is an opinion backed up by reams of academic , anecdotal and observed evidence . 
  tell me that academic evidence that shows how the french despise/dislike the italians . 
  what university has a chair of contempt for italians . 
   i 'm talking about 1870 - 1920 , not the ** relatively small numbers that tried to escape fascism ** from italy on 1940 . 
  fine . 
  mussolini , your grand example of acceptance came to power in 1922 . 
  lets look how the population of italians in france was changing :  . https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/diaspora_italienne_en_france 1921 : 450k italians 1931 : 800k italians 1936 : 720k italians afterwards the war gears up and suddenly well italians in france would be weird because italy was trying to be accepting by spreading fascism across europe . 
  so in 10 years , indeed just a piccola difference . 
  twice as many italians fleeing fascism . 
  really small difference indeed . 
  and well , acceptance of italians sure was n't helped by the fact that in 1897 , an italian anarchist assassinated the french president sadi carnot . 
  thanks a lot , 
  i can czech if i have some chile . 
  to chill out , maybe some cuba with cognac or champagne . 
  or maybe some malta whisky . 
  now you 're speaking a language i understand . 
  we can agree that all this process takes time . 
  yes so now you have no players . 
  what do you do ? 
  where do people keep their valuables to get pickpocketed ? 
   also , if you wanted to , there are hundreds of academic pieces made in france which study the extraordinary levels of racism that all european immigrants to france suffered at every point from the 1870s to the 1960s . 
  wow . 
  you do not say . 
  i am shocked ... shocked i tell you . 
  the french were hostile when poorer portuguese , italians , polish that moved here . 
  i did not know ... shame on me . 
  it 's so odd that 1940 europe was not a welcoming place . 
  in paris people do n't think a ton about italy . 
  in the south-east , they 're very common . 
  very common to meet french with last name - elli for example . 
   from an inferiority complex not at all . 
  since de gaulle , we 've had an inferiority complex for americans . 
  with the brits it 's an equal rivalry . 
  and with the germans , it 's complicated . 
  82 , never forget . 
  italy , we do n't have a lot to be jealous about . 
  we love to go on vacation . 
  the same with spain . 
   . i 'm a lyc\u00e9e international boy , i might as well be french , i 've lived there ( bordeaux , paris , cannes ) and over half of my social circle is french . 
  how long will it take for someone to hack it and watch porn in church :d, 
   and the gov can not be chosen via referendum last time i checked . 
  of course not . 
  that 's not how a republic should work . 
  so the problem is whole political system . 
  lets take an example : the current romanian football team . 
  they suck balls . 
  begining with the late 90s it started sucking more and more . 
  is it feasible to say : okay starting from next year , we 'll have a good team ? 
  `` brothers on the other side of the alps '' i 'd rather not , thank you very much . 
  many of those fine italian ladies gave me some very unbrotherly thoughts . 
   afterall , we shot out president and his wife on the christmas day in ' 89 . 
  yeah but romania is n't in a dictatorship now . 
   the parliament has a 7 % approval rate at the moment . 
  so they should ask for new parlamentary elections and call it a day . 
  we 'll see what those demands are . 
  honestly i love italy . 
  it 's awesome and i think you over-estimate the hate . 
  i found them to be nice to me but i 'm sure you know more about what italians think about the french than i do . 
  and tons of italians moved to france and there are a lot in the south . 
  our cultures are close though . 
  those horses were taking during a sack of constantinople . 
  ( thank 's assassin 's creed ii , you have taught me well ) . 
  i do love venice .
