  it was awesome . 
  on the main road from the station to san marco ( through rialto ) , full of tourists . 
  300 meters away from the main road . 
  and at the arsenal , towards the eastern tip . 
  awesome . 
  completely devoid of tourists . 
  people hanging their clothes to dry on ropes . 
  i loved it :d, 
   they are there because we have to bribe doctors to be admitted in the free healthcare . 
  so are romanians okay to pay more taxes in order to give doctors proper salaries ? 
  and teachers ? 
  did n't people also vote for parlament ? 
   but when so many people do speak up , then have new parlamentary elections . 
  and send everybody home . 
  let the people speak . 
  honestly , you 'd have to be an idiot to get pickpocketed . 
  weird . 
  we do n't . 
  why would we dislike out vassals ? 
  i 'm particularly fond of italians . 
  and the san marco basilica is another example of italo-byzantine architecture . 
  so people who go in the street trump people who vote ? 
  sounds more like a shouting match than a democracy . 
  yes . 
  the ceo is a human person . 
  thank you for that information !, 
  but why let facts get in the way of an edgy comment on reddit ? 
  those companies already treat their workers as slaves . 
  emirates used to fire their flight attendants if they got pregnant . 
  lets not let them also use subsidies to undercut out own companies . 
   demos kratos means power of the people . 
  and the people have spoken and are still speaking . 
  those are 50k people . 
  i think the population of romania is larger than that , isnt it ? 
   aka you do n't mess with the president 's proposals atm . 
  is that how democracy is supposed to work ? 
  edit : is a dissolution of the parliament likely ? 
   considering we were pretty much on par with sweden and denmark before we found oil . 
  i do n't see why not . 
  [ norway ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/norwar_exports_tree_map_%282009%29.pdf ) [ sweden ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/sweden_export_treemap_by_product.png ) look at those exports . 
  norway looks closer to russia than to sweden nowadays . 
   the u.s has like 4 times your population . 
  more like 5 times . 
  you mean to say french students have 1200/5 = ** 240 billion ** dollars of debt . 
  til . 
   but i 'd rather ** have the option ** . 
  well lets give those people the option . 
  18k per year is just tuition is ** no ** option . 
   the poor in norway has it better than the poor in france . 
  lets see when oil runs out . 
  you better get like sweden . 
   . and would you belive it , so does the poor in america . 
   . that 's from the economist , their own calculations working off an oecd set of measurements . 
   this is n't the traditional gdp numbers , nor purely economic numbers in fact . 
  things like quality of life , civic engagement are included . 
  any non-propagandistic measurements ? 
  the economist is well the economist . 
   . and risk having your business nationalized or confiscated by the government ... can happen anywhere that one . 
  if you business is deemed of national interest , it 'll get nationalised . 
  is n't it enough to look at living standards across the world and economic indicators ? 
  the ones from the economist ? 
   you pay more tax and get paid lower than here so i guess it adds up . 
  yes . 
  i rather pay taxes than have debt . 
  i have more freedom and control . 
  and in france students dont have ** 1 trillion ** dollars of debt . 
   usually they advocate for lower taxes and a more business friendly environment as well . 
  yeah . 
  lates take a prime example . 
  he 's all for lower taxes and friendly business environment . 
  he also shits on immigrants . 
  how eeevil they are . 
  all while hiring then . 
  ask those right wing workers what they think about globalisation , out sourcing , sending factories out of the country . 
  now ask those business leaders what they think about the same things . 
   in norway i get to choose between mediocre public healthcare well france has a better health care system that norway . 
  maybe there 's room of improvement . 
  or if you are in the u.s you can choose to go to a cheaper state college 13k per year suuuure is cheap man . 
  i basically got paid to study through scholarships . 
  like you make it so painfully obvious , in the us or in norway you 're eaither poor so go fuck yourself and your kids . 
  how dare you be poor or you can create a social democracy . 
  i like my welfare state . 
   are you free to start a business in your country ? 
  are the corporations in your country owned by private owners for profit ? 
  can you live of capital in your country ? 
  in nazi germany you could very well do that . 
  that tells me ** nothing ** about how good or bad the system is . 
  a lot of french politicians are graduates from [ ena ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9cole_nationale_d%27administration ) . 
  but i guess you went to ens right ? 
   free version of capitalism than the u.s. 
  depends on what you mean by free . 
  i 'll have my cheap , one of the best in the world health care systems in the world vs the us pandering to the insurance companies , any day of the week . 
  i 'll take my cheap 500 euro per year education vs the us 40k per year education any day of the week . 
  any week of the year . 
  my uni might not had the budget ( read capital ) of ivy leagues ( though it ranked higher than some ) but goddamn i appreciated and thanked the tax payer every day . 
  now i happily pay taxes . 
  so no , those two systems are not equal or equivalent . 
  and regarding the technocrat govt ? 
  how will it get its through the parlament vote ? 
  do they plan to name people from every party in that govt ?
