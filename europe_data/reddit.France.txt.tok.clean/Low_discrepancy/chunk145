  well ask europeans if they want american capitalism they 'll say no . 
  ask americans if they want european capitalism , they 'll say no . 
  to a european social darwinism is about as appealing as communism . 
   well they do always talk about the working class . 
  and ? 
  if your leaders are less competent than you are , you 'll have problems at the horizon . 
   . ironically the working class have turned right well depends on what kind of right . 
  a lot of the right that is succeeding nowadays is talking about protecting workers from foreigners and cheap foreign labor . 
  that right is successful . 
  a different right is focused on companies and providing low tax cheap labor environments . 
  that right is n't super successful . 
  didnt have time to watch the full vid . 
  what are the injustices he 's mentioning ? 
  he says people dont talk about them and then he glosses over . 
  that being said , life 's unfair . 
  if you 're pretty you 're more likely to get certain benefits , if you 're tall you 're more likely to have higher salaries compared to short people . 
  and a lot of interactions he 's talking about and awkward situations are about when he 's meeting people for the first time : so you mean people you just met do n't fully know everything about you ? 
  omg i am shocked ... shocked . 
  does anyone have any idea how this crisis will end ? 
  capitalism can be very broad . 
  from welfare capitalism ( social democracy ) to every man for him self . 
  from big govt to extreme libertarianism . 
  what kind of capitalism are you refering to ? 
   and even now , look at the socialist leaders in greece or france or wherever , they are all rich white 1 % . 
  yes political leaders are rich . 
  also , contrary to popular opinion , they also tend to be of above average intelligence . 
  hence a higher probability of success in life . 
  why would you demand for a left wing politician to be poor ? 
   finally , you pay for armed police anyway lets take this ** slowly ** . 
  we dont have as many armed policemen as military . 
  to fulfill the needs , we 'd have to hire ** more ** . 
  because we have ** a lot ** of synagogues , churches , schools , airports , bus stations , train stations , metro stations . 
  do you understand things a bit more clearly now ? 
  also the army is n't just for deploying outside of the border . 
  understand now ? 
  id rather have trained marksmen that are easy to deploy . 
  when there 's an attack all synagogues , schools , train stations , subways , airports , etc get protection . 
  and they need heavy protection . 
  hence the military . 
  i dont want to pay for thousands and thousands of swats that would normally be on stand by and act only very rarely when the military does the same job . 
  and it 's the friggin job of the military . 
  but i hear you say : the swats dont need to be just swats . 
  they can be regular cops at times . 
  like these guys you mean ? 
   . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_jean_charles_de_menezes if someone 's handling a semi-automatic , i want that person to be a highly trained professional . 
  not these bozos :  http://intrigue.ie/media/2014/08/ferguson1.jpg you point your gun at something you want to kill !, 
  lets looks at the mb and what they stand for : sharia ... awesome ...  . on the issue of women and gender the muslim brotherhood interprets islam conservatively . 
  its founder called for `` a campaign against ostentation in dress and loose behavior '' , `` segregation of male and female students '' , a separate curriculum for girls , and `` the prohibition of dancing and other such pastimes ... '' yeah . 
  screw 'em and the donkey they ride bareback . 
  it is related because you 're making it seem like the mb was some mythical party that was meant to usher a new era of freedom and liberties for all in egypt ... not really . 
  the dictatorship of the majority is a dictatorship . 
  just because 50 % +1 people want to make life a living hell , that does n't grant them automatic moral right : `` welp it 's a majority !, 
  democracy wins ! '', 
   french armed police should be able to hold their own against a few gunmen . 
  well no . 
  during the ch attacks 2 policemen got killed . 
  so no . 
  but but outrage : / police brutality . 
  authoritarian regime : / dictatorship . 
  truly a world of mad men that surround us . 
  lets just ignore the nose they make . 
   was egypt 's first & only democratically elected president . 
  the way i view a democracy is a regime that protects minorities too . 
  in that sense , there 's a difference between a democracy and a dictatorship of the majority . 
  the fact that the majority voted for morsi does n't make it by magic something good . 
  did we forget our meds today ? 
  after 3 govs got toppled this week in europe , macedonia you better do something big if you want my attention . 
   do n't care , never leaves turkey related threads . 
  lmao . 
  trollers got ta troll . 
   it is your wet dream that we become some shithole which is run by sheria but we do not wave white flag like you do . 
  i actually dont care what happens to turkey . 
  darn you 're defensive , are n't you ? 
  so the state pays to raise them . 
  and once they hit 18 they discover : hey why should i stay here when i can leave for we and get a much higher salary ? 
  now you 're back to square one . 
   no stoning , no hand cutting , etc. 
  do turkish people want that ? 
   yeah the eu is such a great nation , so not corrupt and caring for its people  the eu is not a nation . 
  greece is a nation . 
   by 2100 moldova will lose 54 % of its population , if current trends stand . 
  in the case of romania it is 45 % . 
  i doubt we can say anything about what will happen in 85 years . 
  that just shows your bc policy isnt good . 
  it 's not like these people want the kids . 
  what 's a reformed islam ? 
   the sin is expressed when these intoxicants are exclusively used to get drunk or high . 
  so unless some weird loophole , you can not drink then ? 
  that being said . 
  alcohol has a long history . 
  regions all over europe have been dedicates and influenced by their drinks . 
  you socialise and you share . 
  it 's an experience . 
  heroin has n't such a magic history . 
   no acceptance . 
  because muslim . 
  hey man . 
  maybe some day the majority of muslims will be atheists . 
  then you sure are heck will be welcome . 
   few armenians .
