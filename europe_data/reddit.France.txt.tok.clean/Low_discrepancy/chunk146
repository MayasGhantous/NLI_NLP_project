   insanely talented physicist from the austro-hungary makes me mad as fuck it broke up into the clusterfuck of today . 
   with all that shit we could have invented the atom bomb ez . 
  well it was n't the ah empire breaking up that put a huge break on scientific progress . 
  it was the little period in history when in central europe being jewish was n't really fashionable . 
  and by extension `` jewish physics '' was also looked down upon . 
   thus eastern europe had a huge support for these governments , including poland and yugoslavia do you read what you write ? 
  im dont with this . 
  cheers . 
   living under a rock in a small village does that to you ... 
  the heck are you on about ? 
  peaks and troughs . 
  from 59 until 81 , the `` right '' in its various forms has been in power in france . 
  then for 14 years the left until 95 . 
  from 1995 until 2012 , the right . 
  now the left again . 
  so the we 're not thaaat leftist after all . 
  whatever that means actually . 
  because the right only has become very rightish since sarkozy .

  the main idea is that poor ass countries dont give a shit about tolerance . 
  look at greece nowadays : a little poorer ? 
  boom the vote neo nazis in their parliament .

   eastern europe had a huge support for these governments , including poland [ ha ha ha ha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) [ ha ha ha ha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nkvd_prisoner_massacres ) [ ha ha ha ha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_%281939%e2%80%9346%29 ) [ ha ha ha ha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/august%c3%b3w_roundup ) [ ha ha ha ha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_anti-communist_resistance_movement ) [ ha ha ha ha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bucharest_student_movement_of_1956 )  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-soviet_partisans  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 but okay . 
  lets take it slowly man . 
  lets take a case study : romania . 
  in 1924 the romanian communist party is declared illegal because it proclaimed that romania should be broken up . 
  this is a normal thing . 
  rough translation :  the archives of certain romanian institutes show that , the majority of communists were from national minorities . 
  the explanation is simple : feeling very little attachement to romania , or even hostile to its existence in the boundaries set after 1920 , those minorities were more attracted to international ideals . 
  in 1940 , the ussr breaks up romania taking bessarabia and northern bukovina . 
  romania thus is forced to join an unholy union with the axis ( they also break up transylvania ) . 
  the pcdr stayed illegal until magic magic 1944 when romania with the axis forces was losing . 
  king michael organises a coup and changes sides , to join the allies . 
  the capitulation is signed in septtember 1944 . 
   the coup effectively amounted to a `` capitulation '' , [ 8 ] an `` unconditional '' [ 9 ] `` surrender '' [ 6 ] [ 10 ] to the soviets and the rest of the allies . 
  in the wake of the cease fire order given by king michael , [ 11 ] ** between 114,000 [ 7 ] and 160,000 romanian soldiers were taken prisoners of war by the soviets without resisting , and they were forced to march to remote detention camps , located in the soviet union ; about a third of the prisoners perished on the way . 
  [ 12 ] ** so now according to you romania loves the ruskies and those ruskies feel the love and invade romania :  estimates of troop levels vary between 750,000 and 1 million ( estimates of british military officials ) , to between 1 and 1.5 million ( estimates of the romanian general staff ) ; many western diplomats and experts refer to more than 1 million soviet troops . 
  but wait :  on november 8 , 1945 , king michael 's name day , an ** anti-communist demonstration in front of the royal palace in bucharest was met with force , resulting in dozens of casualties ** . 
   https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifesta%c8%9bia_de_la_8_noiembrie_1945 the soviet occupation lasted from [ 1944 - 1958 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_of_romania ) in 1944 , by soviet muscle , king michael is forced to accept a communist govt but refuses to sign any laws and decrees . 
  the govt is working illegaly but they continue . 
  in 1946 sweet election . 
  they 're very democ ...  in general , commentators agree that the grouping carried the vote through widespread intimidation tactics and electoral fraud , to the detriment of both the national peasants ' party ( pn\u0162 ) and the national liberal party ( pnl ) . 
  pnt and pnl were the tradition non-communist parties . 
   it is contended that the bpd ( pcr ) and its allies did * not receive more than 48 % * of the total ( ** according to several estimates , the actual votes for the pn\u0162 should have allowed it to form government , either on its own or as part of a coalition ** ) . 
  [ 3 ] ** instead , the elections awarded the bpd ( pcr ) a crushing majority ** inside the new unicameral parliament -- it had 348 seats on its own ( 379 with its allies ) , whereas the pn\u0162 was awarded 32 seats and the pnl only 3 . 
  how many soviet soldiers in romania at that time ? 
  1 soldier every 30 people . 
  that 's a friggin invasion . 
  and even under the most massive fraud , the communist party couldnt win . 
  but was still awarded 90 % of the seats . 
  and now the fun starts . 
  michael is forced to abdicated :  a fost \u0219antaj . 
   it was blackmail . 
  they told me : `` if you dont sign immediatly , we 'll be forced - why forced , i dont know - to kill over 1000 students we have in our jails . '', 
  the pnt members are [ framed with some shitty affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c4%83m%c4%83d%c4%83u_affair ) and sent to work camps sighet . 
  a former prime minister of romania died in that jail  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iuliu_maniu actually 2 former prime ministers  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantin_argetoianu look how impressive the list of inmates was :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sighet_prison also gherla , the danube-black sea canal camps created in 1949  ** at the time , an estimated 1 million romanians were imprisoned in dire conditions or engaged in often deadly slave labor , digging out the danube -- black sea canal . 
  **  one estimate places at over 200,000 the number of people who died as a result of exposure , unsafe equipment , malnutrition , accidents , tuberculosis and other diseases , over-work , etc. , of those working on the project between 1949 to 1953 . 
  more conservative estimates place the number at `` considerably in excess of 10,000 '' . 
  my oh my how romanians loved communism . 
  or [ pitesti prison ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pite%c8%99ti_prison )  it is considered the largest and most intensive brainwashing torture program in the eastern bloc go read up on it . 
  you 'll learn how political prisoners were forced to scrub floors with the rags ** held with their teeth ** . 
  or how ** political inmates had to lick toilets ** . 
   so do n't user your presentism fallacy because back then people genuinely did believe in socialism . 
  take some sand and you know ... 
   ee as a whole does n't love russia and hate the us i was being sarcastic . 
   we have our problems here too but is there a better example of such a successful society with such a culturally/ethnically diverse population ? 
  well then paris center . 
  it 's a lovely multicultural area . 
  also my home is a lovely multicultural area . 
  and space is a lovely multicultural area . 
  that 's cheating a bit , dont you think ? 
  also whats the percentage of blacks in prison vs white in cali ? 
   it was a really old a321 , it had 17 years of age and one of the oldest in service . 
  no 17 yo plane should blow up like that . 
  they are routinely checked . 
  once every x number of months they are stripped apart . 
   may have taken some kind of maintenance short cuts uhm such a problem is way bigger than maintenance short cuts . 
  it went from working fine to blowing up . 
   all will be made clear from the data from the blackbox . 
  or one can check the maintenance history of the plane . 
  also any accident history to the tail . 
  there have been cases of planes breaking up mid-flight , but usually because they suffered tail incidents in the past . 
  if it didnt have any tail accidents , nor a bomb , it would be a massive issue for airbus . 
  well the way blacks are treates in the us is in no way different than how muslims are treated here . 
  and i 'm struggling to find examples of people that were treated as poorly as canadians or australians treated their native populations .
