   there was a time in france not too long ago where someone from paris would not identify themselves as belonging to the same group as someone from nice or another occitanian city so we 're stating obvious things ? 
  people like dividers . 
  from football teams they support , to the state they come from to what university they went to . 
  heck look at the best religion joke in uk  http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/sep/29/comedy.religion  once i saw this guy on a bridge about to jump . 
  i said , `` do n't do it ! '', 
  he said , `` nobody loves me . '', 
  i said , `` god loves you . 
  do you believe in god ? '', 
   he said , `` yes . '', 
  i said , `` are you a christian or a jew ? '', 
  he said , `` a christian . '', 
  i said , `` me , too !, 
  protestant or catholic ? '', 
  he said , `` protestant . '', 
  i said , `` me , too !, 
  what franchise ? '', 
  he said , `` baptist . '', 
  i said , `` me , too !, 
  northern baptist or southern baptist ? '', 
  he said , `` northern baptist . '', 
  i said , `` me , too !, 
  northern conservative baptist or northern liberal baptist ? '', 
   he said , `` northern conservative baptist . '', 
  i said , `` me , too !, 
  northern conservative baptist great lakes region , or northern conservative baptist eastern region ? '', 
  he said , `` northern conservative baptist great lakes region . '', 
  i said , `` me , too ! '', 
   northern conservative \u2020 baptist great lakes region council of 1879 , or northern conservative baptist great lakes region council of 1912 ? '', 
  he said , `` northern conservative baptist great lakes region council of 1912 . '', 
  i said , `` die , heretic ! '', 
  and i pushed him over . 
   not trying to create parallel societies within our nation , and working to embrace the diversity more have made our country better on the whole . 
  its not perfect by any means whatsoever . 
  by ** our nation ** , do you mean the us nation ? 
  the democracy that sent the japs to camps ? 
  the separate but equal one ? 
  the one with a million people march and end of segregation a full 100 years after the civil war ? 
  the one with malcolm x ? 
  the baltimore and ferguson one ? 
  the one with the south carolina shooting ? 
  the one were a black person born in 1991 has a 69 % chance of visiting prisons at one point in their life ? 
  the one with the most likely to win the republican candidate declares :  when mexico sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
  they 're not sending you . 
  they 're not sending you . 
  they 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with us . 
  they 're bringing drugs . 
  they 're bringing crime . 
  they 're rapists . 
  and some , i assume , are good people . 
  ** that ** nation ? 
  listen , i am ** not ** saying that france is better than the us and god knows i love to jerk off to the marseillaise . 
  but claiming that while the us is not perfect , it is doing better than europe at integrating , is such a friggin bs statement my eyes can not roll fast enough in my head . 
  we 're doing just as well as you guys are . 
  namely very shitty at it . 
  romania now finland ? 
  til european govt are like girls and bathroom etiquette . 
  when they leave , they leave together . 
   europe 's irrational fears about national identity have lead to insistence on separating groups and creating divisions , where none existed before , in society which have led to social unrest . 
  do we have any example of a state that managed to put those fears aside and was successful in its integration of completely different cultures ? 
  the guy 's trying to resume the past 50 years of 3 major and very different european countries in a webpage . 
  that 's a cumulated 150 years . 
  imagine going back just before the civil war in the us and writing a history of immigration for the us in a single article . 
  it 'll end up half-assed . 
  the woman agreed to a fake marriage , named a person that she did not know ( well that 's not fair , the only she knew about the to-be - guardian is that he is a fraudster ) as a guardian , has no useful skills so goes into prostitution . 
  at point does a person become a bad parent ? 
  while we 're at weird things americans believe : jerry lewis has n't been popular in france since the 1960s ( i.e. 
  when kennedy was still alive ) . 
  i 'd say [ p\u00e9tanque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p\u00e9tanque ) . 
  think of it like boules . 
  very popular with the somewhat elders/middle-aged people and especially in the south of france . 
  but i do n't think it 's that popular outside of france . 
  white 's not a colour though . 
  he got custody based on fraud . 
  how is this not a serious charge . 
  the child deserves having that woman removed from its life . 
  the kid should be taken in by the authorities . 
  why was the kid not taken by the authorities ? 
  yeah . 
  i dont argue with that . 
  but when there 's an accident , you immediatly ask about the engineering of the whole beast . 
  which is managed by the french and germans . 
  if a particular part fails , you go ask the manufacturer . 
  you dont bring every company that worked on all the parts to asses the accident . 
   he 's a really , really greedy idiot i think he was more of an idiot . 
  basically the true black mailer knew a friend that knew a friend that knew a friend that knew benzema . 
  and through that chain benzema got that he should talk to valbuena . 
  doubt he did it for any money , he was just being retarded . 
  is that a democratic procedure ? 
  what will he do if he does n't agree with those demands ? 
   it 's what you do in between . 
  sanctions is good message . 
  if you 're sarkozy , how do you ask to implement sanctions against russia then go negociate with medvedev a peace treaty knowing full well georgia needs to be solve asap ? 
   should we accept russias imperialism or not is what we have been arguing about here . 
  im confused then . 
  say you 're sarkozy in 2008 . 
  georgia is invaded . 
  what do you do ? 
   he cares more that this is negative blowback for his actions . 
  but do russians think omg we should completely leave syria alone ? 
  or are they more : lets turn the whole thing into a huge piece of glass ?
