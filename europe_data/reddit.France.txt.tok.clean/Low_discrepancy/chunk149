   well , you seemed to be pissed about denmarks politician who sees snowden as a criminal , do you have any influence there , no . 
  i agree with that part . 
   deal with it why should n't europe give him asylum ? 
  i still have a vote . 
  to be fair it is so so delicious . 
  and so goddamn cheap . 
  i was confused when people were queuing to get in the underground car . 
  i felt like turning around and asking : are we really staying here waiting for the subway to come ? 
  why are n't we huddling ? 
  how are we supposed to block the exit for people that wan na get out ? 
  who isnt ? 
  but it 's not like my opinion has any influence on putin . 
  the good half or the bad half ? 
  why not pederal ? 
  so ... how easy is it to move to lituania ? 
  ( see i even call it by its new names guys ) . 
  well it 's still a wee bit long . 
  what is he trying to show using what arguments . 
  i do n't say `` man , thats just the way it is , deal with it '' . 
  because it sounds like i approve it . 
  who 's saying that ? 
  i am simply against sending french soldiers to die in a georgian war . 
  if estonia wants to , more power to them . 
   15 years is not an argument . 
  its the shift in thinking that is important . 
  do you want to understand why things are happening the way they do or do you wan na gloss over things and go : hey that 's 20th century stuff . 
  lets think of the future , maaan . 
  i am of the type that wants to understand the way the world is and not see it through the lenses of my own personal ideology or bias . 
   it does not make it okay . 
  15 years ago nobody was talking about gay marriage . 
  thinking changes , for some people sooner than others . 
  and i guess i know where you at . 
  uhm , gay marriage isnt exactly global politics is it ? 
  the french system is a semi-presidential while the us is a fully presidential system . 
  the french president does n't have any veto rights on laws while the us president does . 
  and i dont fully agree with giving powers to pms like in germany or uk . 
  you have the same guy voted for years upon years . 
  it gets tiresome . 
  at least france and the us have a limit on the number of terms . 
   oleg kalugin so your source is a guy that has no connection with the snowden case and has lived in the us since 1995 . 
  and has testified in front of the us congress against russian spies . 
  uhm ... 
  thanks but it 's a little to propagandistic for me personally . 
  well they also make planes in china . 
  that doesnt mean much , except that if airbus wants to sell planes in china or the us , they are expected to produce some over there too . 
  ** but ** :  is there a hussein government in place now ? 
  i think ** not ** . 
  mission accomplished . 
  next !, 
  so in hungary , if a spy comes to you saying he 's a journalist , you can ask him :  are you a spy ? 
  and he 'll be forced to say the truth ? 
   france always had a strong centralized power is there a big country nowadays that does n't have that ? 
  angsty teenagers that become angsty students . 
  ah okay so you dont have any sources . 
  good to know . 
   are you in 20th century you mean the century that ended 15 years ago ? 
  well arent you modern to assume that what happened 15 years ago has no influence on current day events . 
   use / u/low _ discrepancy on reddit . 
  this is n't twitter :p \\ #lowdiscrepancy . 
  pff, 
  but the area is already populated by mostly people that wan na be either independent or part of russia ( from news sources , i have no idea how locals really are , its a part of the world im completely foreign with ) . 
  are we pulling a crimea here ? 
   to invest heavily enough to georgia to deter further aggression you 're free to do with your money whatever you want man . 
  but you can not put georfia into nato for example . 
  to make the annexation of these lands cost more than they are worth . 
  i think we 're a bit too late to the party . 
  they annexation de facto happened . 
  well that 's sphere of influence for you . 
  you remember the cuban crisis right ? 
  in this case russian tanks were going up and down georgia like it was black friday . 
  sure the us could have started economic sanctions ( and considering that level of trades with the us is 5-10 smalled compared with the eu ) . 
  so that would surely have been a serious blow . 
  not to mention that it takes months for those sanctions to inflict any pain . 
  when rusky tanks are up your ass , time is a luxury you do n't have . 
  i dont know about you guys , but i feel honored when companies like total , apple , amazon or google give me the honour and priviledge or buying their products . 
  please do not tax them at the same level as ordinary , small companies . 
   state of design and state of manufacture - france and germany ( and the us too , but they are not participating afaik ) us ? 
  wait what ? 
  because they can ? 
   unpopular truth . 
  we all agree with your version of history . 
  we just like to lie ourselves . 
  and also no more civilians killed . 
  georgia just had to let go of abkhazia and south ossetia ( which was normal , they had no power on it ) . 
  do they still have russia tanks in gori ? 
  you 're welcome . 
  like london : /, 
  you 've got a lot of if and buts in your statement . 
  too many for my taste . 
  true . 
  and sarkozy did have to broker the peace plan . 
  and for good or bad , the deal did work and things calmed down . 
   eea membership which is most likely ( it will be what brussels is pushing for ) . 
  eea membership also implies that freedom of movement for eu citizens . 
  that includes romanians and bulgarians . 
  if cameron wants to introduce restriction on eu immigrants problems will happen . 
   he was stepping in would make him a patriot . 
  the decided to charge him with 3 felonies , 2 from the espionage act . 
  before obama how many charged since 1917 ? 
  during obama : 7 .
