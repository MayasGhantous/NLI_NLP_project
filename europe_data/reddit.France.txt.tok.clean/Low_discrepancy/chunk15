  a book is about the author . 
   but it does not represent the overall level well science = money . 
  more money more science more nobel awards . 
  do i really need to explain this ? 
  i thought it 's obvious . 
   but you are right for the rest , america is a shit country and awful . 
  me :  yes the us are an amazing country and the top economy , military power and scientific power in a per country analysis darn , you sure love playing the victim game do n't you . 
  poor thing . 
   you are right , we should all form our own cultural identities and separate ourself with artificial boundaries , artificial boundaries ? 
  what 's the name of the mayor in your city ? 
  now tell me the name of the mayor of nimes ... of novi sad ... of faro . 
  what do you mean you do n't know them ? 
  but you know the name of the mayor in your town . 
  what is this artificial boundary . 
   we totaly should live in separate communities just because some guy told us to do so 300 years ago . 
  what ? 
  i 'm not sure you understand the difference between historic facts and your rants . 
   yes , you believe that because you are a bigot . 
  yeah i 'm not particularly surprised that that 's your rebuttal . 
  the quality of your first comment showed the quality of your logic enough . 
   the us has the most nobel prizes in the world . 
  dude ever heard of ** per capita ** ? 
  doing that would mean that the us has as many nobel prizes as about france and the netherlands and germany and uk are higher . 
   but consider that usa is still the greatest country that has ever existed . 
  here are some facts that proves me right neah man it 's just a huge circle jerk that ignores some historical realities . 
  ww1 & ww2 crippled europe . 
  we became non existant . 
  our top minds were killed or left . 
  you commentt is just a dump of statistics without any analysis so they 're basically worth jack shit . 
  and in some cases they are utterly bs  the us is the most scientifically impactful nation in the world and you quote the shanghai ranking . 
  wtf is that ? 
  honestly i would spend all day debunking your bs . 
  yes the us are an amazing country and the top economy , military power and scientific power in a ** per country ** analysis , but claiming '' the greatest country that has ever existed . '', 
  has got to be the most wtf thing i 've ever heard . 
  edit : also you ca n't friggin unite europe because we 're a bunch of different states . 
  during the last 1st of april prank . 
  listened to some russian songs . 
  quite good some are /, 
  luckly they left early . 
  group stages if i 'm not mistaken . 
   i see some pattern here , but i 'm afraid to talk about it , as in today 's europe this would by biased and racism . 
  with the fn super high in france , afd going up in germany , the democrat party in sweden can we cut the crap about people being persecuted automatically if people talk about muslims ? 
   greek enough for demosthenes and his supporters , dude have you heard of pandering ? 
  google it . 
  i honestly wo n't continue this pointless conversation with someone that does n't understand that politicians do no care about accuracy when they give speeches . 
  good day . 
   i 'm saying , ancient macedonian people were not considered greek , well they were part greek like it or not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_macedonians and that being said : no one really gives a crap about the macedonians just like no one gives a crap about illyrians . 
  it 's all about alexander and the empire he set up building which was hellenistic in nature and resulted in other hellenistic empires just like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ptolemaic_kingdom, 
  you meant to say overstay their 90 day period not overstay their visas . 
   plus i do n't think we 're discriminated in the us , so we have that going for us , unlike in many parts of western europe . 
  it 's not like romanians do n't discriminate against gypsies ... ee is in no shape or form better than we in terms of discrimination . 
   if more than 3 % of germans overstay their visas , germans do n't need visas dude . 
  that 's the whole idea about being visa exempt -  not having visas . 
   public opinion and public opinion is n't historic analysis . 
  politicians express their views and choose to distort reality to fit their agenda . 
  this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argead_dynasty is historic fact . 
   all romania is doing in this case is making itself -- and its eu friends -- poorer . 
  yeah ... not really . 
  between the candu and exploiting the [ largest european gold resources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabriel_resources ) , canada is taking out money than bringing in . 
   : ancient macedonians as schr\u00f6dinger 's greeks , hellenic only when convenient . 
  demosthenes ? 
  when did politicians become historians ? 
   this is our law . 
  it is applied equally to all countries of the world , not just europe . 
  europe is not a country . 
  we must consider romania as a separate country . 
  romania fails our criteria . 
  that is all there is to it . 
  and eu law stipulates that decisions must by unanimous . 
  whatcha gon na do ? 
   by just this logic , declaring war to bulgaria would be cool . 
  dude open a book on logic . 
  and go to the chapter about fallacies . 
  that is not a chapter you ought to follow . 
  neither do the migratory people that were the slavs , nor the romans not the celts but it 's not far fetched to say that people currently living in italy are descendants from the romans , the greeks from ancient greeks ( the ancent macedonians being part of the ancient greeks -  alexander the great being part of an ancient greek dynasty [ the argead ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argead_dynasty ) ) , while the current day macedonians , yugoslavians etc etc are the result of the slavic invasion that started some 800 years after that ancient greek guy went about conquering the world ) . 
   in macedonia 's case it makes sense . 
  they actually were great . 
  not the same macedonia ... 
   the winners were announced on tuesday , with the castle scooping ** the popular vote ** , a prize quevedo will go to collect at the awards ceremony in new york on may 12th , the architect told the local . 
  yeah ... 
   but , for those who are highly talented & ambition , a place like the us is going to be a better landing place , b/c you can make more , grow more , and innovate more . 
  basically , it 's different strokes for different folks . 
  exactly . 
  two systems . 
  not one is better than the other . 
  let both have their place . 
  we fought hard in europe for this regulation and removing them would make things turn to the worse because let 's face it , when your boss tells you worker joe pulls 60h work weeks and you 're doing 40 because you have a family and kids and ya know this project is due in 2 months ... look at what / u/bosgeus is suggesting . 
  that * we 're keeping people back !, 
  * that 's utter horse shit . 
  nothing stops you and your friends from working 100h work weeks if that suits you . 
  go for it buddy . 
  it 's not like the police will barge in your company and arrest you because you worked too long . 
   no problem . 
  1 yeah so ? 
  i can find you tons of curvs , that does n't mean shit without proper explanations . 
   both employee as well as employer would be happy if the workforce works . 
  how many hours does your silicon valley tech work ? 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2013/08/25/why-silicon-valleys-work-culture-is-killing-us/#49b6a0e92feb 50-60h work weeks at times ? 
  is that normal to you ? 
  how many employees would be happy with that ?
