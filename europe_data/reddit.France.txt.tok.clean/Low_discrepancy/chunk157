  ** and lets continue :  immediate after the soviet takeover of the region in 1940 the ** soviet government deported or killed about 41,000 romanians ** ( see f\u00e2nt\u00e2na alb\u0103 massacre ) , while at the same time further ** encouraging an influx of ukrainians from the ukrainian ssr . 
  ** impressive huh ? 
  and we can look at crimea and see what the people were and still are ... 
   and , of course , you can not deal with serious crises without external help . 
  yes . 
  of course . 
  well look at that . 
  bessarabia and galicia and northern bukovina were n't part of ukraine . 
  nor was crimea . 
  thanks . 
  i was too lazy to google . 
   you are de facto living on romanian land by being in moldova , there 's no need to have lived over the border for this to make sense . 
  so why not make it a de jure living in romania ? 
  merci . 
   speak russian ! = russian . 
  or are all americans `` english '' because they speak english ? 
  or all quebecois frenchs and therefore should we send the army there to take control ? 
  now that would be retarded would n't it ? 
  from 1789-1956 crimea was under russia rule . 
  in one form of the other . 
  58 % declare themselves ethnic russians . 
  ** ethnic russian = = russians ** . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31869747 and i quote :  the most recent figures indicate that something like 60 % of the population are ethnic russians , 25 % ethnic ukrainians , and 12 % crimean tatars . 
   given that many pro-ukrainians have left , the russians are probably proportionately in even more of a majority . 
  i am done arguing with you . 
  you present no arguments only strawmen . 
  you bring in alsace lorraine when it has nothing to do in this discussion . 
  you say the data from the 2001 census is fake and to prove it you talk about edit wars on mh17 . 
  you are told that the large majority declare themselves ethnic russians and then talk about americans or quebecans . 
  no quebecan will say they 're ethnic french . 
  add to that all the personal insults ( how much i am getting paid by the russians and other insults ) . 
  if you wan na know how much the ruskies are paying me ? 
  not enough to continue this non-debate with you . 
  so you wan na claim citizenship of a country you never intend to live in or heck even set foot ? 
  how is that a normal behaviour ? 
  well how is it a normal behaviour for romania to give citizenships like that ? 
  and when you say moldova did nothing for you , that tells me that you clearly are just in it for economic reasons . 
  your mentality better change if you wan na adapt to different settings . 
   do you believe that a state can be viable if arbitrary bits of it can spin off at will ? 
  we start from the assumption that ukraine is a viable state . 
  i disagree with that view point . 
  also , you got ta show me how crimeans really really wan na join ukraine and that they 're being subjugated by the russians . 
   come on . 
  using a falsified wikipedia page ? 
  really ? 
   how is it falsified ? 
   http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/03/13/the-ethnicities-of-ukraine-are-united/ ** more than 75 % in this graph speak russian as a native language in crimea ** . 
   all romanians get romanian citizenship upon birth ; it 's not contingent on your personality , ideals or intentions . 
  it 's contingent on being romanian . 
  whether you want to live in romania or not is entirely irrelevant . 
  are your parents romanian then ? 
   indeed , but they are not , and there are legal procedures if they wish well no european force will join the ukrainian war simply because the legal procedures were not met . 
  we 're not thaat anal retentive . 
   are you going to start re-adjusting those borders too ? 
  are we going to tell catalunya they shouldnt have a referendum ? 
  does anyone actually believe in a fair referendum crimea would have voted differently ? 
  heck between a completely failed state and a semi-failed one , which would you pick , honestly ? 
   alors l\u00e0 c'est de l'invention totale . 
  on ne presente pas de contre-argument on sorte les insultes . 
   http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26387353 58 % se d\u00e9clarent d'ethnie russe . 
   majority of ukrainian soldiers killed in this war are from south and east ukraine , they definitely do n't want to be part russia and how many have died in crimea ? 
   following your logic switzerland must cease to exist and be split between neighbors by language majority they 're living happily in their country . 
  if crimea ever wishes to be independent , they should be . 
  show me proof then that crimea wants to join ukraine again . 
  that the majority of people wan na come back . 
  i wan na see that . 
  ukraine is the one asking for help , not europe . 
   what about wwii . 
  and i say that as a french . 
  on parle de la collabo francaise mais pas de celle ukrainienne . 
   la carte d'ukraine ressemble effectivement pas \u00e0 celle d' y \u00e0 1 si\u00e8cle . 
   800 people does not represent the population ,  with ** two studies ** out of the way , ** both western-based ** , it seems without question that the vast majority of crimeans do not feel they were duped into voting for annexation , and that life with russia will be better for them and their families than life with ukraine . 
  and we 're talking about gallup here . 
  and the results are obvious . 
   applying some characteristics to people based on their nationality did you read what i wrote ? 
  ukraine is a state that also contains vast regions where only 30 % speak native ukrainian . 
  it 's a frankenstein state that contains regions that it should never contain . 
  ukraine is ** too large ** and has to get smaller . 
   anyways there are legal procedures in both ukrainian and international laws . 
  none were followed by russian occupants that 's a different issue . 
  but it 's like this . 
  couples can live together without being legally married . 
  it does n't mean someone is keeping their partner hostage . 
  that 's why no one is going to war over ukraine . 
  you see the map and you realise the majority of people on the east regions feel they are russia . 
  if i were you , i would do the same thing . 
  it would be stupid not to . 
  your country has lost in one swing about 300 euros for every child , woman and man . 
  insta-lost . 
  it 'll probably not be able to pay pensions and any investements in infrastructure or whatever ? 
  forget that . 
  at the same time , you 're leaving your country to the communists . 
  it 's all fine and dandy to leave and build a nice life . 
  but what are you leaving behind ? 
  not to mention that again , citizenship is given to people that wan na be citizens of that country and not use it as an easy visa getter . 
   considering the fact that moldova was part of romania until cccp annexed it , many moldovans are of romanian descent . 
  the ones that are n't were part of the population transfer , well known soviet strategy . 
  well those people that do have the passport , leave the country and what 's left is just the population transfer groups . 
  [ forbes : one year after russia annexed crimea , locals prefer moscow to kiev ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/ )  so personal insults are not welcome , but nazism is , mods ? 
  someone should explain what nazism is .
