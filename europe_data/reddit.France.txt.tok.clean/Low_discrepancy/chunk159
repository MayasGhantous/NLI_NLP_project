   intelligence agency has spied on ** french public 's phone calls ** , emails and internet activity , says le monde newspaper from your guardian source . 
  germany 's national intelligence agency , the bnd , spied on ** top french officials ** and the ** eu 's headquarters ** on behalf of us intelligence , german media report . 
  can you tell me of any german , swedish or whatever foreign agency that is spying on ** my ** emails ? 
  nope just the gchq  . love you too buddy !, 
  then please move the referendum for 2016 . 
  so we do n't have to wait another yeat . 
   . the uk along with new zealand , australia and a couple others are part of five eyes . 
   it 's an anglo-group and nothing to do with being a puppet . 
  so uk is spying on european citizens for nz ? 
  do you think we 're dumb or something ? 
  plus the uk is in the eu where cooperation is a massive factor . 
  the same does n't go for australia or nz . 
  and no , no foreign european agency is spying on my emails . 
  the gchq are . 
   . so the uk should follow whatever germany and france want ? 
  uk should follow ** logic ** . 
  and logic dictated that the war in iraq was based on lies and it was all bullshit . 
  that 's how you show you 're not a puppet state . 
  the whole gshq spying on europeans for the us maybe ? 
  going into iraq even thoigh france and germany was against it . 
  europeans dont particularly love uk either . 
  the whole spying on every eu citizen and passing on the information to the us and nsa . 
  so how does that stop people from building new housing ? 
  you can take a loan and build a new building . 
  would the rent not higher than the loan apply in this case too ? 
  is the problem in sweden not enough housing or is there enough housing but it is unoccupied ? 
  at some point , everybody will stop caring . 
  kinda like the us elections . 
  https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:europe_no_belief_enhanced_2010.png#mw-jump-to-license the percentage of french that dont believe in anything is higher than the percentage of dutch . 
  that being said , again that is ** not ** what secularism is . 
  secularism is just the state being indifferent to the beliefs of its people . 
   because a parliament is something for the people and by the people and a public institution ok , go to a university and start calling your professors nazis . 
  think that 'll turn out stellar . 
   it is your right to do so . 
  i do not share your banning favourism in any parliament . 
  not even in democratically elected parliaments like bestkorea and cuba . 
  i meant as image of something . 
  to those outside europe , he is an image of the european union . 
  in a more strict meaning , the meps i voted for all agree to not do the nazi salute in the european parlament and punish those who do . 
   he can do it wherever and whenever he wants and your options are reduced to not vote for him in the next european parliament elections . 
  i voted for mep that decided to have regulation on what to do and what not to do in the european parlament . 
  that 's enough for me . 
  if you want , you can vote for meps that will change that regulation . 
  good luck . 
   support of equal marriage , according to a map by eurobarometer in 2015 .  i dont think you understand what the definition of secularism is . 
   if that were true , why is france less tolerant about a lot of things when they 're compared , say , to netherlands ? 
  can you give specific examples ? 
   i do n't want my taxes to be spent on commie meps either , but sadly this is not how it works . 
  i respect any opinions . 
  nazi symbolism isnt an opinion last time i 've checked . 
  i did not go : omg this guy is absolutely right , merkel is indeed a nazi . 
  fuck dude , lets stop making it seem like everything 's a nazi is we disagree with them . 
  or stalin . 
   since france wanted to save its dying influence is there anything you dont have a strong opinion on ? 
   just because it 's illegal in france does n't mean it should be illegal for meps who come from countries where it 's not . 
  if you visit my country , you respect my laws . 
  dude honestly this is pointless . 
  have a good one . 
   yes , the parliament , not the meps . 
  if you do n't like his ideas , vote for parties that will counter him . 
  that said , i 'm not a big fan of this system . 
  is he did that in france , he should know that it 's illegal to use nazi imagery and can face jail time . 
  so was he in strasbourg at the time ? 
   that 's brave . 
  i half expected them to just force islam on the entire population . 
  you dont know denmark then ... 
   progressives taught them the exact words to use . 
  actually , i personally hear that comment from many extremists ( from both sides ) . 
  for example : i can not wear nazi symbols ? 
  this is not democracy , this is a dictatorship . 
  he votes on laws that will affect me personally and the eu parlament is one of the institutions that represent all of europe . 
  i 'm done with this . 
  if you disagree , write your mep to support godwin remarks in the parlament . 
   \u00c9ire will into abortion once we 're fully into secularism . 
  buddy no one 's as secular as france . 
   who decides what is misbehaviour or `` attitude unbecoming of an mep '' ? 
  the chairperson and the organisational bilaws . 
  do you go at work offending your fellow coworkers ? 
   you make it sound like the suspension is some sort of `` further measures '' after previous , less-strict measures . 
  this is not the case here . 
  because it was already a very extreme gesture . 
   oh , come on . 
  is that really all you can say about that ? 
  should i really be tempted to bring out the good-old `` what if all parliaments want to kill all < insert favourite race or religion here  '' . 
  strawman fallacy . 
   i do n't know what to make of this . 
  should this be some quality attribute ? 
  i support banning such behaviour in the french parlament , i will support it in the eu parlament . 
  it is a work place and a place of reason . 
  you do not do it in the work place , why should you do it there ? 
  his actions represent all europeans and all europeans are concerned by this behaviour ( well not the swiss , just eu members ) . 
   my point still stands . 
  he 's been voted in democratically . 
  his reponsibility is to his voters . 
  he 's in the european parlament , he represents all europeans . 
   are you in support of the idea of taking away political rights ? 
  if one misbehaves yes . 
  it is an attitude unbecoming of an mep or any official . 
  he sets a bad image for poland and for europe . 
  it 's not a friggin circus .
