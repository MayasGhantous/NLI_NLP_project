   i do n't see why you want to keep people un - or underemployed , or overqualified . 
  burn out ? 
  ever heard of it ? 
  use that silicon valley tech and google it . 
  we 're comparing a unified market of 320 million with one carved up in tiny bits by beaurocracy but also culture , language etc. 
  a person can move from ny to california without feeling too weird . 
  a person can not move from france to finland and not feel a culture shock . 
   less labour rights , yeah fuck that . 
   the issue with most people is that they do not consider the fact that labour rights are actually a burden to the working class as well , and that regulation is often protectionism of uncompetitive old-boys/cash cows . 
  maybe because we do n't want to burn through our workforce ? 
  people have lives , it 's not all work work work . 
  and for people in the silicon valley it seems to be the opposite . 
   much of our human capital left , is leaving , or will leave to overseas because there are countries around the world that are better for them , especially and particularly in the tech sector . 
  darn what a lovely anti european neo-liberal circlejerk . 
   in a ** advisory ** referendum, 
   well , still no fire and brimstone from where i am sitting . 
  cuz they basically ignored it . 
  which is normal . 
  60 % of 30 % of people should n't get to decide for everybody . 
  from ftse 100 companies dude . 
  so 1/3 expressed publicly they disagree with leaving . 
  anyone sign something saying they wan na leave ? 
  well it might not be a bad thing to leave . 
  airbus said they 'd reconsider their participation in the uk if they leave . 
  maybe those technical centers can go to spain for example . 
  they need a boost . 
  also it 's closer to toulouse . 
   when you have to blatantly lie that a multinational corporation is imf ? 
  a corporation ? 
  dude are you for real ? 
   they realize there 's the possiblity of britain actually doing better without the eu than with it . 
  if this were the case then well you would see other countries potentially leaving the eu . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  how many states in the eu are islands ? 
  how many do n't have massive trade with the eu ? 
  the core is germany and france . 
  italy and spain come really close . 
  none of these countries want to leave . 
  the east does n't want to leave . 
  the only ones likely to leave would be maybe denmark . 
  yeah i would n't be too worried about the stability of the eu if denmark leaves . 
  maybe it 's some subliminal ad for les visiteurs . 
  [ i could n't care less what you call it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjo3khczw4 ) . 
  and this obsession with the past does n't help you move forward and invent new interesting things . 
  well i do n't mean to say anything bad , i love italy but goddamn those people are stuck up when talking about food and customs . 
  i thought we were bad . 
  nope . 
  yes italian cuisine is awesome but goddamit chill dude . 
  if it 's not going down your throat , why complain ? 
  the person is either french or knew nothing about france and decided to pull in some filler stuff . 
   it is worrying how you are worried about the well being of people whose sole intent is to destroy you eh . 
  / u/ccm200 's views are hardly a representation of the general mood in france . 
  suffice to look at the last regional election . 
   russia is the friendliest nation in the world !, 
  these imperialist pigs were undermining the democratic and constitutional order of the russian democratic federation . 
   bucharest , bra\u0219ov and constan\u021ba bucharest is southern and brasov is central . 
   the issue is that it is based mainly on consumption that 's actually a good thing . 
  / u/generalram should visit the eastern part . 
  it is as poor as people expect . 
   while in asia it 's completely opposite except israel . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  men marry younger women ** everywhere ** . 
  there is n o country where the age of women is higher than that of males . 
  kuwait achieves equality . 
  * us : men 29 women 27 * brazil : m 28 w 26 * indonesia : m 25.5 w 22.3 * china : m 25.86 w 23.89 * turkey : m 26.7 w 23.5 * india : m 28 w 22.2 * iran : m 27.4 w 22.1 i am super confused about your comment . 
   being essentially the one constant administration in terms of richness and quality of life , it is n't saying much . 
   is was the definitive richest and fanciest country in the world ( short of maybe china ) from a bit before the fall of the roman empire to the 1100s . 
  that 's really not saying much . 
  yes because no bank would ever engage in risky behaviour . 
  sure man . 
  german death : in wine russian death : in the snow should n't those be reversed ? 
   gib clay back pls . 
  gib jews back pls . 
  and european domination in science too while we 're at it . 
  germany ruined that for all of us, 
   a decision does n't need to be unanimous to be democratic . 
  i disagree . 
  ha see . 
  i guess we no longer live in a democracy . 
  he 'll invade areas that are in his backyard . 
  just like the us will mess areas in its backyard . 
  and france in its and uk in its . 
  the land is lost , what 's the point of more people dying ? 
  maybe a little more real politics . 
  what could obama do huh ? 
  besides economic sanctions there 's nothing one can do . 
  yeah . 
  he should have started ww3 because a piece of land 99 % of humanity does n't care about . 
  says who ? 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a9fugi%c3%a9s_de_la_guerre_civile_syrienne_en_france at most we 'll have 25k because they do n't really wan na come here : http://www.franceinter.fr/emission-lenquete-la-france-boudee-par-les-refugies-syriens, 
  what 's a new corruption-free police ? 
   for example , my mom is technically a millionaire , but those are her retirement savings that she has saved up after working for 30 + years well i assume your mom is not french . 
  there are many 5k syrian refugees in france atm . 
  maybe ... 
   no more interventionism . 
  eh , neither trump nor clinton seem that keen . 
  obama has the right idea : less focus on the military , more on the economy . 
   instead of offering a better deal , tax wise they just pull out their guns : give me the money or else !, 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how any of it works .
