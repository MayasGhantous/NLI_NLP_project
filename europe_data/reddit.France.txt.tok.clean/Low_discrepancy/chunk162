  it costs nothing and actually brings in money . 
  gays like fancy weddings too . 
   obviously , but we are talking about reasons based on which you vote for a party . 
  it 's good supplementary reason , but it should n't be the main guiding issue a party that wants to remove gay marriage in france would not be voted to power . 
  if people in poland would care about reducing discrimination , yeah it would matter because a new party would be formed that has the same ideology except the gay issue . 
  but polish dont care about reducing discrimination and inequality and that 's it . 
  they do not feel the need to change this aspect of their society , heck most think homosexuality is an abnormal act . 
  supply and demand . 
  if the supply for cheap workforce increases , then it only makes sense to reduce salaries , reduce worker conditions , make it easier to fire someone . 
  these things will lead to decreased social conditions and increased precarity . 
  you have a refugee that does not speak german and you put him or her on the same market as a german native . 
  you have to make it interesting for the employer to hire them . 
   yes there 's problems that should be fixed , but then again back to original point - there are far more important and pressing matters well the homosexual marriage problem ** can ** be fixed by your govt . 
  there 's nothing stopping them to get fixed . 
  if you allow gay marriage , it 's not like unemployment will go through the roof or that the deficit will increase or whatever . 
  it 's a big problem that takes 10 minutes to solve . 
  why are you making it seem like it 's really complicated to fix and other things ? 
   depends on country , in poland it 's not that much . 
  so because it 's not much , it 's okay to discriminate childless homosexual couples . 
  a little discrimination is okay . 
  it 's not much . 
  just a little . 
  it 's fine . 
  how about if you remove all tax breaks for all married people then ? 
   exactly the same thing as if you were as stright unmarried couple - get your will written * but those straight unmarried couples are unmarried * ** by choice ** , not because some bigots decided yeah you 're gay , you shouldnt get a right to this particular institution . 
  not having a marriage means there 's no divorce , there 's no splitting of common belongings in case of a `` divorce '' , it means precarity for one or the other . 
  it means that in the case the couple splits , one might not be able to see the children that they helped raise . 
  how does a will fix that ? 
   they 'll have to keep it low to keep us production down , so that 's not much of a choice . 
  besides , i believe some of the opec countries have started setting their own prices and now iran will be able to export oil too , wo n't it ? 
  oh god today i 'm so happy . 
  and how do you feel like ? 
  well people are what they choose to define themselves . 
  for me the default is she 's french because she is born and bred here . 
  if someone is born and bred in a different part of the world but they decide they love france and wan na move here and get all the rights and responsabilities . 
  then they 'll become french too . 
  but random person = / = people . 
  human rights are just for the liberals to worry about ? 
  good to know ... 
  what about tax breaks ? 
  married people usually pay smaller taxes than if together . 
  what happens in case of sidden death ? 
  what happens if there 's a will but the grandparents want the kids . 
  who do you give the kids to ? 
  some person there is no legal relation or the grand-parents ? 
  but if the war is over and the region is stable in 3 years what do you do ? 
  do you send them home ? 
  do you tell them okay guys you can stay because in 3 years people will be obviously integrated right ? 
  what exactly do you do ? 
  and the gist of what enders said was to reduce that minimum wage . 
  * or * you can create a two tier system , asylum seekers and normal citizens . 
  if person g gets paid 10 euros per hour and person s gets paid 5 euros for the same job , that is sure to foster social cohesion right ? 
  no one way person s would be unfairly treated . 
  so the solution is n't a two tier system , what 's good for the gander is good for the goose . 
  so what do you do now ? 
  you can give s jobs g would never want but at 2-3 million s , you got ta start inventing bs jobs to keep them working . 
  or you allow them to have the same rights to the job market as g . this will mean g will be fairly unhappy with how things are going and will drive salaries down . . 
  this is why neo-liberals are in favor of refugees . 
  they just see it as a means of cheap labor . 
  just because poland dismisses the human rights of a few people , that does n't make it a non-issue . 
  democracy =\\ = dictatorship of the majority . 
  i 'm grabbing my pop-corn because i 'll love to see how the extreme leftists juggle between a ) accepting more refugees and b ) salaries and conditions for workers being reduced in order to help the refugees . 
  i do n't know the political landscape in germany well enough but it 'll be interesting in france . 
  quoting :  `` we must have the courage for deregulation in the way that so far we know from the united states , ''  `` it is better to enter the labour market with mini-jobs or low-paid jobs than not at all and to be condemned to social security , doing nothing and frustration . '', 
  this seems to confirm a previous post about this crisis creating a downward pressure in the job market :  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pbno3/german_union_boss_warns_of_downward_pressure_on/, 
  so homosexual couples are recognized by the state or not ? 
   because of bad jobs , small salaries , etc as a we , i had the impression that the standard of living was increasing in poland , that wages are also higher than in other ee countries and that it 's doing fairly well economically . 
  how do samaries compare to 5 years ago - 10 years ago - 15 years ago ? 
  democracy =\\ = dictatorship of the majority . 
  can you read your comments and replace lgbt with jewish ? 
  thaaanks . 
  if you 're gay and raise a kid with your partner and die , the partner should be able to get the kid , not adopted by the state . 
  it 's basic human rights . 
   a survey from 2005 found 89 % of the population stating that they considered homosexuality an unnatural activity . 
  half believed homosexuality should be tolerated . 
  deeper problems are afoot in the polish society . 
  so they have to fight their own problems ** and ** politics to conceive ? 
  damn . 
  sorry for them : /, 
  \u252c \u2500 \u2500 \u252c \u25e1 \uff89 ( \u00b0 - \u00b0 \uff89 ) it 's okay man . 
  if one works toulon , evry lille thing cannes make you flip . 
  we 'll tours the tables back for you . 
  well one can be financially secure while working in the industry too . 
  it depends hugely on what your specialisation is . 
  i still think you underestimate the opportunities phd students have . 
  but at what point ? 
  do you need 7 subs ? 
  and the vast majority of phds dont end up getting a chair . 
  tis life . 
  they 're not stuck in their job and they can make serious money though . 
  unlike menial work . 
  i mean it 's a full time position but not a permanent position , like engineer or doc or whatever . 
  like i said , she 's french . 
  i dont get your point . 
  a post doc is n't a job . 
  just like a phd is n't a job . 
  it 's an intermediate position that 's only supposed to last about 2 years . 
  afterwards you start making more ( or much much more if you go into industry ) . 
  your comparison is n't valid imo . 
  people who work in academia do n't do it for the money , they can easily find higher paying jobs .
