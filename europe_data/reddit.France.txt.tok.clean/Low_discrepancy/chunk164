  about the calorie counting : is that really a problem ? 
  france italy also have rich cuisines but usually people do n't eat like there 's no tomorrow , so they do n't have really high obesity levels . 
  does n't portugal have a med like cuisine ? 
  maybe there 's a reason why communism originated in england . 
  same job though . 
  this does n't mean the same entry level/junior job . 
  after 2-3 years i 'll assume you 'd know all your employees . 
  if not , there 's a huge problem on your part as your boss . 
  https://youtu.be/8f2yeosxeta though he does n't even do that . 
  he basically says that mistakes were made and there are elements of truth . 
  so yeah ... 
  okay but just the pinkie . 
  to massage the prostate a bit . 
  i 'm not gay . 
  well like i already replied in another comment . 
  for me this shows that the system is broken . 
  well does n't this show that the system is broken . 
  you do n't pay someone more because they know the boss , but because they 're more productive . 
   . among the best-paid jobs , those who come from privileged backgrounds earn ** substantially more than those who have the same jobs ** , but do not come from a privileged background . 
  is that the case for every country though ? 
  because it seems like a serious issue . 
  i fail to see the connection . 
  it 's a terrible incident but i doubt this was brought by a connection between church and state . 
   . experts said the figures suggested that many of these immigrants had been in britain for months or even years , working illegally `` in the shadows '' . 
  it 's in the article . 
  reading your source helps . 
  they were already there, 
  in that case the american company should go to the french court and ask france to prosecute the person . 
  because duh that 's how it 's supposed to work . 
  lets say there 's a country where copyright laws do n't exist . 
  and say apple moves in that country and a company copies apple . 
  why should the us prosecute that company ? 
  it did nothing illegal on its soil . 
  apple should n't have moved in that country . 
  that 's like saying pakistan can prosecute south park because they insulted mohammed . 
  it 's retarded . 
  as a person currently on the soil of sovereign country c , i have to respect the laws of country c not of country a. 
  no matter whom i 've offended . 
  in france it 's illegal to make nazi comments . 
  if an american comes in and acts like a nazi , he ca n't plead the first ammendment , because it has no value here . 
  the us can not ask not to prosecute the dude . 
  if he 's a nazi on us soil , who gives a shit . 
  if they have jobs , they 'll stay . 
  you did the same witvh romania and bulgaria . 
  how it 'll be a huge invasion . 
  nothing happened . 
  well you 're saying that the us would demand extradition . 
  that wont happen in the vast majority of eu states . 
  i wonder how many of them will be in jail in 5 years from now ? 
   it 's like getting married for pecuniary reasons . 
  until the 1800s and romanticism , pecuniary reasons was the main reasons why couples would get married . 
  the importance of the dowry and all that . 
   i would interpret that in light of the lack of knowledge and interest for moldova in romania . 
  when moldova will start realising that communism has nothing to offer , they 'll have to move forward towards europe . 
  and who is moldova 's best-friend ? 
  they still live in a warped universe where the ussr was still big . 
  moldavians needed 2005 to arrive at the same gdp levels as 1990 . 
  that 's 15 years where democracy just brought a worse standard of living . 
  after this 1 billion dollar corruption case , they 'll go towards communism and lose 10more years . 
   `` moldovan is in fact the mother of the romanian language . 
  to call it romanian is to betray history and to commit injustice to your own mother . '', 
  said voronin that barely speaks the language . 
  yeah ... 
   unlike wg , there is very little interest in moldova for a union , the fact that romania has 20 times the gdp while only 5 times the population ? 
  the fact that 13 % of moldavians have romanian citizenship ( even larger if you exclude transdniestria which is de facto no longer moldova ) . 
  the fact that romania is in the eu and nato , that many students go to study in romania that moldova ** is ** romanian despite what the soviets and ruskies would tell you . 
  romanians still have a very favorable view of the unification https://ro.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/unirea_republicii_moldova_cu_rom\u00e2nia the desovietification of moldova will take time but moldovans will sooner or later see what 's best for them . 
  13 % of gdp loss in a single strike . 
  that 's impressive . 
  that 's very impressive . 
  once pensions will no lo ger be able to be paid ... what will people do ? 
   but it would be myriads of ` one man parties ' ( and their aides ) . 
  so it 's like the present only with breaking up big parties . 
   . these experts would likely have some form of pr team i think people already have these pr teams . 
  called lobbiest or something of the sort . 
  because they 'll just be lobby shills , random expert joe can not pay for campaining . 
  only the richest will have a say , because lets face it people vote for whatever is most in the news . 
   young people already spent most of their time online discussing mundane shit . 
  i thought a ton of countries had a problem with young people not engaging in politics . 
  i dont see how this will change things . 
  after a while , the novelty will wear off and you 'll realise you 're just a vote out of millions . 
  ca n't it be hacked ? 
   a lot of americans are ethnically english i would love to see those stats . 
  probably in terms of ethnicity , the majority are mexican . 
  but marion is n't, 
  who 's cnt ? 
  yeah , it 's like people forgot the 4th republic . 
  and how do you keep people engaged ? 
  i mean lets take a very technical topic like i dont know what . 
  how do you engage people and not just those that are involved ? 
  i think it 's the baby boomers getting older and more conservative . 
  but once they keel over ... you can see with the homosexuality issue . 
  in the 2000s it was a weird issue now most everybody thinks yeah . 
   antisemitic and racist elements of the party of her father http://www.liberation.fr/france/2015/02/27/islamophobie-homophobie-la-compilation-des-derapages-fn_1210335 the fn is still the fn . 
  you can put lipstick on a pig ... 
  the majority of the french do not feel we have a refugee problem . 
  the flow of refugees has n't passed through france . 
  sure 30 % will vote for le pen . 
  but heck 20 % voted for her dad . 
  50 % increase is a lot but it wont get larger .
