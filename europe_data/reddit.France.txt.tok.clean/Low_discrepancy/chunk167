  how do you catch an employer that bined a resume ? 
  you have no obligation to tell someone why you refused their resume . 
   . but you are not allowed to use your position to punish them for their thoughts in their head , i never thought people like that were subtle about their thoughts . 
  that would mean they understand why what they 're thinking is wrong in society . 
  doubt they have that capability, 
   no , but there are laws preventing him from influencing your carreer in consequence or firing you or punishing you for example . 
  or if you can prove he dropped your cv specifically about that , or ( more likely if he 's caught asking you such questions during the interview ( there are agents in civil posing as prospects doing anonymous controls on the topic ) . 
  nope . 
  employers just drop resumes when they 're from certain banlieues . 
  good luck proving it 's because of that . 
  just like the reputation of the people that cale from your uni might open or close doors , so goes for where you 're from . 
  sad but such is life . 
  the reverse is also very true society can continue without you , good luck for you living without society . 
  for the people that are happy to live on the fringe , that 's okay . 
  but you can not have extremist views ** and ** want for society to treat you like any normal person . 
   well the rule of thumb is not talking about politics with your employer . 
  there 's no law that prevents anyone from talking current events . 
  any company might decide to have a minute of silence for the ch attacks . 
  what would you do if an employee is rowdy ? 
  in a lot of schools many kids didnt understand that and then they 're amazed they 'll always be on the fringe of society, 
  lets face it , they want more police and stronger police ( might not be bad , i have no clue if the issue can ever be solved ) . 
  btw , would you ever hire a dude that thinks the charlie hebdo deserved it ? 
  do the majority of the french want that ? 
  nope . 
   they could limit the stop & frisk , put body cams on all cops ( mandatory during service hours in the field ) , and rehabilitate the neighborhood the police unions will refuse . 
  like they always do . 
  is the kid that died today not swedish ? 
  or what about his teacher ? 
  thing is , you wan na live in a society and expect it to morph around you to fulfill your needs ? 
  france is a country where assimilation is expected , and not just integration . 
  so irrelevant organisation can not raise money ? 
  colour me surprised . 
  they should go to the big countries currently not having immigration/refugee issues and shake them for money instead of bitching about the czech republic . 
  or do you want me to believe that the jordan refugee camps are better than czech ones ? 
  it takes courage if you go on people that can actually fight back . 
  if you go after kids , yeah coward and scum . 
  the constant fear mongering about sweden and germany getting invaded by immigrants that will change europe 4eva tends to push less stable people to commit heinous crimes . 
  well the problem is that the un ** should ** do something . 
  organise refugee camps . 
  get of their ass . 
  they 're pointless . 
   i stopped caring abouy what they say a long time ago . 
  the only thing they 're good at is making lists . 
  top 20 world heritage sites . 
  beziers is not beijing man . 
  edf needed it after the whole areva shit storm . 
   the broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm-setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior . 
  the theory states that maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism , public drinking , and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness , thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening . 
  putting your clothes out to dry is not vandalism , petty crime , anti-social behaviour or whatever, 
  it makes ecological sense to use the heat from the seat to dry off your clothes and not use a drier . 
  it 's also part of a long southern european history to dry them by hanging them in the street . 
  again go to venice in italian neighbourhoods . 
  tons of people drying them in the sun . 
  it just shows it 's not a dead town or city . 
  it 's alive . 
  yeah ... that 's what i thought . . 
  i was taking romanian trains in the 90s . 
  the toilets were smelly and awful . 
  they would open directly on the tracks . 
  are you implying the kgb did n't have infiltrators ? 
  do you have any post ussr files that show the extent of the kgb infiltration program inside europe and the world ? 
  i 'd be keen to read it . 
  if not , stfu, 
   took a look at you history , it seems you are a russian shill so i wo n't be wasting any more of my time trying to explain stuff to you . 
  thanks . 
  i wont have to bother to tell him how wrong he is . 
  recently in a cave in romania they found bones from several thousands of years ago . 
  the dna in them was closer to the dna of south east asians and native americans than to europeans . 
  the story of humanity is a story of migration . 
  just because 200 years ago some dudes decided to put some random imaginary lines and impose passports and shit , does n't mean it 's a natural state for humanity . 
  trust me , the world in 10 000 years will be significantly different than it is now . 
  claiming you can stop people wanting to move is pure folly . 
  the right also criticises him so i do n't understand your point . 
  beziers has become a sort of joke in france . 
  lets see what backwards legislation they 'll come up with next : you ca n't hang your clothes by the window ? 
  wow . 
  much progressive . 
  this guy probably never visited venice or italy in general . 
  it was an old style corail type of train . 
  and it was also the same type between venice and trieste . 
  so it 's like having only old corail rolling stock between uhm bordeaux and toulouse . 
  ( maybe that 's the case though , never been to toulouse :p ), 
  you should see the level of modelisation they 're using . 
  mutliphasic fluid flows . 
  that 's serious shit . 
   our slow `` regional '' trains suck , i know , but that 's probably true all over the world . 
  ever been to france ? 
  visit sometime . 
  italo is made by alstom btw :p . 
   f they do n't benefit france , why has france not ended them already ? 
  they might not benefit us in the case of a brexit . 
  lets face it , we 're not super cool with how the issue is handled anyway . 
  yeah . 
  but once the immigrants express the desire to leave on their own means , it would be silly for us to stop them . 
  lets hope they fixed the 2 massive issues that the ice had, 
  had to take a train from venice to udine . 
  nightmare man . 
  nightmare . 
  do you have the hs ones only between certain cities ? 
  pretty darn sure these people are not the syrian refugees europe is facing .
