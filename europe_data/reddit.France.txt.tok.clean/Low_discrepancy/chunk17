  you make your money here ? 
  pay your taxes here friend or go make your money in panama . 
  our job creators ... noooo . 
  france has 1.6 million millionaires . 
  10k is well you do the maths . 
  it 's enough to own a non shitty apartment in 80 % of paris to almost be a millionaire . 
  yeah sure ... 
  if you say so . 
  i am replying to the statement :  i find it funny how they had to place romanians and gypsies separately, 
  i would n't want to penalise any person born in the bible belt that wanted to escape : /, 
  trust me way too many romanians do n't believe that either . 
  it 's like romanian gypsies are not romanian . 
  a different species . 
   i find it funny how they had to place romanians and gypsies separately romanian gypsies are romanian , bulgarian gypsies are bulgarian so on and so forth . 
  it 's not [ olanda . 
  the term is biologic father . 
  use it ... words have meaning . 
   i find it funny how they had to place romanians and gypsies separately do they have romanian citizenship ? 
  have they lived in that country for 500 years ? 
  yeah ? 
  then they 're romanians . 
  tell that to people raised by step fathers . 
  are you mocking the french taste in beer ? 
  [ the list just got 10 states longer ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/video/2016/02/13/trump-the-wall-just-got-ten-feet-higher?videoid=367388523 ), 
  well that 's how it works in the eu . 
  even though we 're not a country we have common borders as such we require common visa policies . 
  we have the right to remove visas from americans for reciprocity reasons . 
  a visa from any country gives the right to visit any other schengen country . 
  nope . 
  i do n't put american beer in my cereal . 
  what 's there to know about a field of corn ? 
  a group of countries has the right to create a political union . 
  dude can you give it a break ? 
  you did n't bother reading the comment you replied to . 
  this comment here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dqm51/eu_may_require_visas_from_americans_and_canadians/d1tgo8y when you edit a comment you have a star next to the date . 
  like this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dqm51/eu_may_require_visas_from_americans_and_canadians/d1tfpma my comment you replied to ** is n't friggin ** edited . 
  more time reading comments less time getting outraged . 
  do that . 
   ** or ** let in only those that provide the needed documentation . 
  not hard really here ya go buddy . 
  want a definition for the conjonction * or * ? 
   or let in only those that provide the needed documentation . 
  it was in my previous comment . 
  i guess reading more that one sentence is a bit too much huh ? 
  since the us refuses travel to french binationals if the other is from iran or i do n't know what , we can restrict travel to people from iowa or whatever . 
  we have the right to accept whomever we want on our soil and whatever documents we want . 
   if france goes over the threshold , france gets removed ; over what threshold , i do n't have to apply for a visa . 
   the visa waivers are n't predicated on special treatment they kinda are . 
  argentina was removed because economics reasons . 
  and this : http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/21/new-us-visa-rules-could-also-cause-problems-for-americans-visiting-europe it 's okay man , you have the right to accept anyone you want and refuse anyone you want . 
   recently we just got ta wail till the oil runs dry or becomes too cheap . 
  just commenting on us generosity . 
  we would n't want those poles and romanians running about and jumping their welcome period . 
  just using my freedom of speech you brought to france , man . 
   i 'd assume that the us would in turn also remove reciprocity . 
  correct . 
  btw i hope those dumb polish bastards that died in that irakian war you pushed forward count as freedom fighters or something . 
  you should ask a lawyer since i am not one . 
   that 's not a function of their citizenship yeah citizen but vote does n't count in general election . 
  yeah man . 
  awesome . 
    okay . 
  personally , i think that if france feels that strongly and is willing to extend costs to herself france ? 
  i 'm not sure you read the article http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-visas-iduskcn0x4183?feedtype=rss&amp;feedname=topnews&amp;utm_source=twitter  the european union executive is considering whether to make u.s. and canadian citizens apply for visas before traveling to the bloc , a move that could raise tensions as brussels negotiates a trade pact with washington it 's a big organisation . 
  d'accord . 
  oh , if i were to mother kids , people would notice . 
  well until we figure it out , we 'll just put in visas for puerto ricans and other american outer sea territories . 
   people from french overseas territories are french citizens , and treated as such by other countries in the world . 
  so puerto ricans can vote in us elections ? 
  man , til . 
  [ oh wait , they ca n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_voting_rights_in_puerto_rico )  look , if you want the eu to be treated as a single country by the rest of the world , there 's a really straightforward way to do it -- you federalize the thing . 
  or use political levearage . 
  canada is n't in the visa waiver program . 
  again you have the right to give or remove visas for any country . 
  but the eu too should have that right . 
  before that , yeah no visas for american outer seas territories . 
  they 're not really american . 
  i am in favor for a smaller eu that can be federalised . 
  the more countries leave the boat , the better . 
   is this ( what you say about the child 's rights ) in some sense an official position , i.e. 
  what the legislature based the law on ? 
  bioethical law of 1994 . 
   in this situation the child obviously has n't been accused of anything illegal , so why are his/her rights waived ? 
  well this is n't about committing illegal acts . 
  if someone accuses you of fathering a child the judge can order you to participate in a pt case . 
  it 's a right in the sense that people ca n't take your dna from you whenever they feel like it . 
   the dutch public is sick of pumping all of its money into the eu and its interests . 
  how about a nexit ? 
   religious , racial and cultural groups eu is not a religious , racial or cultural organisation . 
  so those things do n't matter when determining whom should we help . 
  what next ? 
  culinary preferences ? 
  clothing ? 
  heck russians are white , christian and close culturally . 
  do we send help into russia ? 
  i think you severely misunderstand what the eu is and why it was created . 
  fine . 
  visa requirements for puerto ricans , citizens of guam and other over seas territories . 
   us states do n't issue passports , and there is no way of knowing what state you are a resident of by looking at a us passport . 
  they should start stating what the state of residence is .
