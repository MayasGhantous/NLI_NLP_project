  but many agree with the principle of the islamist attacks , honor killings are common and women are often treated by their families as if they were still in their home country . 
  for the ** vast ** majority of muslims in france , france ** is ** their home country . 
  honestly it 's like these people never met a muslim . 
   so what you 're saying is that it 's perfectly ok when merkel/germany places limits on eu migration , but the minute another country dares attempt to do the same thing they 're all racist bigots or something ? 
  what ** permanent ** limits has merkel placed on eu migration ? 
  yes , but you still didnt show precisely how only a minimum wage increase would also increase taxes . 
  it seems that all the problems you mention are strictly related to policy issues that are specifically related to slovakia . 
  in all normal countries , a minimum wage usually means more money injected into the local economy immediately because it 's not the type of wage that allows you to save money . 
  why would an increase of minimum wage mean an increase of taxes ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  by claiming that all europeans should be free to move wherever they want in the eu ? 
  how 's that ruining europe ? 
  yes . 
  but who wants to restrict the movement of romanians and bulgarians now ? 
  the uk . 
  napoleonic jewish emancipation laws were some of the most progressive in the world . 
  it allowed for the de-ghettoisation of the jewish . 
  the russian orthodox patriarch declared him the anti-christ because of that . 
  fun fact : the first ghetto was the jewish ghetto of venice . 
   but then at least be honest about it and don \u00b4 t try to paint everyone else as the bad guy . 
  did you try to think that out for a second ? 
  what can merkel say : yeah people of the world . 
  germany spies on other countries !, 
  what 's the immediate question she 'd get ? 
  uhm , what are your spying operations atm ? 
  what can she say then ? 
  `` uhm . 
  can not say . '', 
  there 's no point to spy if you 're going to blabber about how you 're spying . 
  just because ataturk tried a secularisation of the turkish state , that does not make it european . 
  there 's a reason why turkey will never be in the european union . 
  if you add turkey , you got ta start adding israel because honestly israel is more european than turkey and now you start adding countries left and right . 
  a culture should be european if what `` created '' it was a part of europe , geographically speaking . 
  by created i mean when the germs of its culture were created . 
  russia is european because it started in the ukranian region . 
  turkey is not european because the center of its culture was not in the european continent . 
  just because it had an influence on european cultures , that does not make it european . 
  and you can not just look at the last 100 years si ` ce ataturk . 
  no , most people , including myself want to understand . 
  you can only solve a problem if you understand it . 
  this guy is a valuable source of information . 
  but you dismiss it `` west-blaming '' . 
  wtf is west blaming ? 
  do you honestly think the bbc has an internal agenda to make the west feel guilty or something ? 
  the aarhus program shows clearly that by listening to these kids , by engaging them , by showing that their voice matters and they can become valuable members of society , you can help quite a lot . 
  just like being hard on drugs is and will forever be a completel failure , being hard on terrorism was a complete failure , being hard on radicalism most likely doesnt help . 
  but hey it 's probably an agenda by the bbc and bleeding heart liberals to shame the west . 
  i presented several reasons why he got radicalised from the article . 
  it was his personal experience . 
  do you think you know better than him why he got radicalised ? 
  mkay ... 
  so race towards the bottom ? 
  if i 'm a czech citizen and i 'm paying for something in the czech republic , i expect the company that provided the service to pay a % of the profit they made from me to go to the czech govt . 
  that in turn can get paid to build roads and shit . 
  it 's to avoid cheating on the tour de france . 
  that makes one wonder : do the belgians still get married ? 
  or do they marry every person they see ? 
   i 've been treated like shit by the cops because i leaned on a public building once , cops can be jerks . 
  i got bullied in school because i 've got 2 different eye colours and still i do n't want to shoot people . 
  yes , but if the police treats ** every ** citizen like crap , statistically one will snap . 
  are you claiming that the police do not target black people in the us or arabs in france for example ? 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  if you treat your citizens inequaly , problems will occur . 
  not everyone will snap , but statistically some will . 
  add to that the complacent father and the new group of `` friends '' that make him feel worth something , and it 'll blow up . 
  people who are treated like shit by society are not very likely to integrate well . 
  we can see it with skin heads , we can see with other groups . 
  ah yes . 
  the evil media . 
  got it . 
  you won me over with your reasoning . 
  you get a meat and a veggie/rice/fries / whatever side dish . 
  basically these mayors want to ban substitution menus : when pork is served , there 's another non-pork menu proposed . 
  they wan na scrap the non-pork menu and the vegetarian/muslim/jewish kid will get more side dish . 
   but only by banning pork itself . 
  you too got it wrong . 
  substitution menu is a different menu you can ask to be served , when pork is the main menu . 
  these mayors will scrap the substitution menu and instead they 'll give the kids more veggies on their plate . 
  what they should have done : 2 menus : one vegetarian and one with meat . 
  that 's it . 
  simple . 
   you do n't just send around the police to someone 's house if he 's a nice , normal guy . 
  yeah i hear that a lot . 
  so what did the police found then ? 
  did the police find anything ? 
  he claims it was a humiliating thing to go through . 
  and i kinda believe him . 
  the police never raided my place . 
  in the us a lot of people of a certain skin colour also say the police is very rough with them . 
  instead of sending the police , why not send the mahmoud guy have a talk to him first ? 
   the amount of money to compensate for that feeling would be $ 1 million a person easily . 
  are we coming up with numbers all by ourselves . 
  the reality is that humans are very sensitive to inequality . 
  they will quickly adjust to the realities of the german society . 
  it 's not like : omg i was promissed by my smugler a merc , i did not get it ... jihaaaad . 
  they 'll be more likely to radicalise if they notice hans gets a higher paying job than ahmed even though ahmed had the same qualification . 
  they 'll be more radicalised if they 're left alone to fend for themselves in govt built ghettoes . 
  if they get constantly beaten on the head with how being muslim makes you a killing machine ready to strike , that wont make them more likely to integrate in society . 
   what if we do n't care how they feel ? 
  be prepared for problems though .
