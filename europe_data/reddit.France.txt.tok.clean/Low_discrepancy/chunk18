  or let in only those that provide the needed documentation . 
  not hard really . 
   which does n't exactly have to do people who bring the money to the table tend to have more bargaining chips . 
   structural funds of the entire union 's `` neighbourhood policy '' should go - towards morocco/algiers/tunisia / turkey/azerbayjan or moldova/ukraine/bosnia / other european states . 
  i fail to see how in your construction : family , neighborhood , city , etc etc results in saying yeah moldova should get eu structural funds while tunisia should n't . 
  also who would give 1 billion to moldova now ? 
  doubt 30 % would lift their asses for this . 
  t'as dit quoi ? 
   then leave the european union and make a union with them yeah ... france and uk out of the eu will sure make it successful . 
  dude the world does n't work like you see it . 
  i honestly believe that we should n't implement visas for all americans . 
  just for some . 
  who the hell cares about them ? 
  plus i ca n't see myself agreeing for visas for quebecans but albertans ? 
   i guess i just like the idea of us pulling strings behind the scenes . 
  for kim jong un . 
  that 's why they made their own country . 
  with blackjack and hookers and weed . 
  but i guess that explains why for a country that has so many good things going for it , they 're still super fuckin petty against the ukrainians . 
  i declare that i am not . 
  sue me !, 
  is that the hairy ball theorem ? 
  the dutch would be proud about that . 
   15 % -20 % of 18 million people just sabotaged something which concerns 508 million other people . 
  that is how i see it . 
  it 's a franco-german dictatorship . 
   then should european taxpayers send money to the whole region . 
  some countries like uk or france might have tighter connections with countries outside the eu than with croatia or bulgaria . 
   the poor shuck has to bear the cost ? 
  the poor schmuck must declare that he is the father and he refuses to pay anything . 
  if the mother sues for alimony , then the poor schmuck can claim he is not the parent and ask for a pt which will be granted . 
  that 's how it works man . 
  stop acting so offended , it 's like the justice system becomes yucky . 
   so state intervention above parental responsibility ? 
  absolutely horrific . 
  if a parent wants to see if their daughter is a virgin , should we let them ? 
   `` everyone who disagrees with me & nbsp ;  why do you have such a hate for men sorry dude , it 's a / r/redpill level of comment  ok , you now own my care so i want 100 euro desposited into my paypall account every week , if you want you can sue but since the car is yours now you need to pay for it , oops sorry . 
  if the mother declares that you are the father and you do n't object , you 're the father . 
  that 's how it works . 
  ask your dad . 
   so you can sue someones rights away ? 
  yes you can . 
  for example if i am accused of a crime and i refuse to give my dna for testing , the judge can waive my rights . 
  ** the judge ** . 
  not the victim , the parent , the police , santa claus , or whomever . 
  ** the judge ** . 
   does that mean it is a right ? 
  yes , it 's still a right . 
  you have the right to not be sequestrated ** except ** by the state ( when you go to jail ) . 
  you have the right to cast a vote ** except ** when the state removes that right ( when a felony is committed ) . 
  you have the right to live ( except in some countries you can be executed by the state ) . 
  we call this * the state has the monopoly on violence * . 
   yes there is , at least for vast majority of children are born of 2 genetic materials , father 's and mother 's . 
  well then use the term ** biological ** father and not * real * father . 
  the english language is sufficiently expressive . 
   i do n't care about a child that is n't mine if you did n't complain at the moment of birth , the child is yours until you sue . 
   why do you have such a hate for men / r/redpill get outta here . 
   consent is it informed consent ? 
  that 's why the state intervenes through a judge . 
   but also the father 's wallet ? 
  does n't seem fair . 
  when two conflicting parties meet , they settle things in the court of law . 
  do n't you think that 's the correct path . 
   if he wants he can fire you . 
  bzzzz come to france , where your employer can not fire you because he feels like it . 
   i wo n't sue anyone well to break the child 's right to a genetic privacy . 
   so the child does n't have right to be raised but its real father ? 
  there is no such thing as a ** real ** father . 
   o the child has right to `` fathers '' money without any proof no . 
  if a child is born , the male can claim that he is not the father of the child . 
  the mother can therefore sue and if the judge sees probable cause , he can determine that a genetic test be carried out . 
   the father ca n't see if it is actually his child ? 
  if the male does not protest when the mother says yeah he 's the dad , then the male becomes the father . 
  if he reconsiders , then you have to break the child 's right to their genetic privacy . 
  a judge therefore has to determine that a genetic test be carried out . 
  that a child has privacy rights ? 
  no it 's not a joke . 
  does a daughter have the right to keep the status of her hymen hidden from her parents ? 
   how do people determine who the father is ? 
  one parent sues to other to determine who are the biological offsprings . 
  it happened already one famous cases being rachida dati 's child . 
   well it does n't seem unreasonable to parents to rear their children in any manner they see fit ? 
  of course . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  the child has full rights to its body . 
  you can not probe the child , you can not sell its blood etc just because it is your child . 
   in which case i do n't see how testing anything is anyone 's choice but the parents ? 
  so a parent should test the virginity of a daughter even without her consent ? 
  dude are you fucking kidding me ? 
   abo blood tests they 're not 99 % sure like dna tests are . 
   imple techniques like dna fingerprinting the child has full rights to its dna , be it parts of it or whole sequences . 
   you can not be forced to support a child unless a court proves exactly . 
  that is the case in france . 
  but again the main point is ** court ** . 
  you have to have legal procedures . 
  both to protect the child , the father and the mother . 
  when the parent decides to sue in order to find out . 
   if i am expected to pay money that i earn , on something that is no relation to me then yes i expect to know if it 's mine an employer can also say that . 
  since he pays he has the right to know your full status of health , he has the right to know your dna make up etc etc. 
  that 's not an argument .
