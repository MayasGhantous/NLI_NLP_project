  good luck being openly gay in ee and look for a job . 
  several years lived in ee , met about 0 open homosexuals . 
  the church is also super oppresive , considering homosexuality as a mega sin and we should protect our families from this horrible disease . 
  also if you 're in a gay relationship , have kids and die , your partner can not claim anything . 
  so you know , shitty conditions . 
  gay rights is a problem in the whole of eastern europe , not just russia . 
  in many ee countries , gay couples have about 0 rights . 
  * what 's good for the goose is good for the gander . 
  * if you treat russia like a cesspool but when a friend state does the same thing you just shrug , what message are you sending ? 
  the actual message : ** all ** homophobia is wrong . 
  not just russian homophobia . 
  ** all ** . 
  polish catholic church homophobia , russian homophobia , saudi arabian homophobia , iranian homophobia . 
   radical right-wing groups , svoboda and pravyi sektor . 
  svoboda has members in the ukranian parlament and govt . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svoboda_ ( political_party ) putin has made the gay issue a political one . 
  this conversation is also making it political . 
  it should be a human rights issue . 
   it was one of the biggest conflicts in the war but nobody invaded anybody ... 
  when turkey was bombing kurdish positions in iraq , nobody says too much . 
  there 's also proof that turkey gave kurdish-fighting isis rebels guns . 
  when biden blames qatar for the isis crisis , he 's forced to apologise . 
  a single day after russia starts bombing syria : obama declares russia is actually helping isis . 
  what the eff ? 
  when was that obama bravado before this week ? 
  we should also mention svoboda and pravyi sektor that stumped some homosexuals during the gay parade in kiev https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/06/homophobic-violence-mars-gay-pride-rally-in-kyiv/ other marches planned were also cancelled . 
  why would that have started a 3rd world war ? 
  ok yugoslavia was not in the warsaw block but i still doubt people would have considered it any different than the prague events . 
   you really do n't want to go down this route . 
  your past is waaaaaaay darker than ours . 
   not british ... 
  also the floods that killed 16 people on the cote d'azur http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/live/2015/10/04/au-moins-13-morts-dans-des-inondations-dans-les-alpes-maritimes_4782170_3244.html, 
   maybe some people do n't like to beat up innocent people  yeah , but those people arent the romanians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ia%c8%99i_pogrom tl ; dr 13000 jews killed in just a few days, 
  it 's a mountainous area . 
  any bit of rain just runs into the valleys and sweeps over . 
  also when it rains , it pours . 
  it 's kinda weird because in nice now , sunny . 
  ambition intensifies . 
  `` it is better to be a has-been than a never-was . '', 
   public square that 's filled with migrants . 
  is it the polish plumber monthly association ? 
   some refugees even choose to go via russia and cross into finland in the north . 
  if someone puts so much effort into coming into this land , maybe they can be useful somehow ? 
  maybe they really would put their ass to work ? 
  if some chav blows his alcohol laden load into some skank , woo hoo , new citizen lets pony up for his foetal alcohol syndrome . 
  what would that message be ? 
  and often religion is not the actual source, 
   but , as i said , with christianity it is possible to renounce the bible as you can still fall back to teachings of christ . 
  can you give an example of a major christian denomination that has renounced the bible ? 
  and who invaded whom ? 
  ... people shell other people all the time . 
  look at north korea . 
  still nobody invaded them ... 
  romania has one of the cheapest natural gases in europe . 
  it also has resources in terms of oil . 
  they 'll do fine  what if they antagonize us ? 
  thats why there should be efforts to bridge the gaps . 
   smells like typical european leftism if i 've ever seen it . 
  nope , i 'm more real politik in terms of russia . 
  russia 's there , you got ta live with it . 
  beautiful country , beautiful people , great science . 
  literature . 
  i refuse to antagonize them ... 
  well you mentioned tourism and talked about culture . 
  i said so that shows we got ta protect that culture . 
  of course there are good foreign films that have a certain following in the us . 
  but take france or germany or spain or italy and look at box offices every year . 
  calculate the ratio european vs us films . 
  now go to the us and calculate the ratio us films vs international ( not even just european ) films . 
  no contest . 
  the problems americans face to watch foreign films are the same foreigners face when watching english ones . 
  but it 's an uphill battle . 
  americans make movies for a 350 million domestic market . 
  others for 80 million max . 
  so you have to introduce quotas to adjust for things . 
  i wont lie , it 's essential to know english and by knowing that language it 's easier to discover huge parts of the world . 
  but this is culture ... 
  or the bay of pigs ? 
  quick questions : since the fall of the soviet union , what super power caused the wars that caused the most civilian casualties ? 
  because we 're arguing about retarded things . 
  people dont defend culture , they defend its products ... 
  it 's just beating it around the bush bullshit . 
  i 'm explaining you how things work in france , how the country tries to protect its culture through means like this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_exception and what stories like these exist http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33542392 but splitting hairs is more important ... 
  then get french citizenship and vote against it . 
  honestly everybody on the internet has to have an idea on everything ... 
  you can call it whatever you want . 
  it 's just not swedish since that type of music doesnt tell me anything about their society ( except that they love americans ), 
   but it means they do n't need to worry about russian tanks . 
  if russia had wanted to invade , they would have done it in 89 . 
  lets be realistic , they dont have the money and power to conquer half of europe for shits and giggles . 
  russians like every people wan na live a good life . 
  oh 1 movie . 
  cool . 
  lets compare the other side : iron man 1 iron man 2 iron man 3 uhm im not going to continue ... 
  well that 330 million us market wont really want to buy foreign songs or foreign movies . 
  you missed point a ) georgia attacked russia ... that 's a good reason to invade . 
  edit : the us invaded countries because they democratically turned socialist . 
  also bay of pigs . 
  so yeah ... 
  superpowers be superpowers \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af,
