   any children they are being made to pay for feed and house , yes . 
  then you sue the mother . 
  what 's the problem with sueing ? 
   person being forced the personal is n't forced . 
  the personal can sue . 
   so a child has a right to privacy from their parents ? 
  yeah pretty much . 
  should parents have the right to test if their daughters are virgins without their consent for example ? 
   if a child is n't mine i have no responsability to it , so what gives you the right to have dna information from that child ? 
   are you saying strange men have a responsibility to take care of random unrelated children ? 
  are you saying strange men have the right to know the genetical make up of every child ? 
  can you perform a dna analysis and send me the results . 
  thanks . 
   so lets say a man distrusts his wife but not enough to sue . 
  again that 's neither here nor there . 
  the child has the right to genetic privacy . 
  just because said dad raises and feeds the child , that does n't give him all the rights . 
  lets say a man fathers a child but does n't recognise him . 
  should the wife steal his dna from him ? 
  or should she sue him ? 
  well that 's neither here nor there . 
  concerning french law the child has the right to genetic privacy . 
  and even if you raise and feed that child , you can not break that privacy . 
  unless you sue . 
  who gives a shit what your feelings are towards your wife . 
  huh ? 
   i guess french redditors on / r/europe will defend anything about their country , the good and the bad . 
  & nbsp ;  stop with your ad nominem attacks . 
   all the village men you just have to deal with it . 
  this is the dumbest thing i 've heard in a while that 's because your brain produced that . 
   it 's like not allowing dna evidence in court because of genetic privacy . 
  if you want to get dna from a suspect , the suspect has to agree to give it . 
  if the suspect refuses , then you need a court order . 
  it works just like that . 
  happy now ? 
  no i am pointing out how hypocritical you are in just two phrases . 
   it is in a child 's best interests to be born . 
  well it is not a child . 
  it is more of a parasite at that point since it fully depends on ** one ** host . 
  the host can refuse to carry to term . 
  we can argue for the rights of bacteria to not be destroyed by anti-biotics at this point . 
  once the foetus develops a functional brain , we decide it has rights . 
   what about infidelity , is n't that important ? 
  once a child is produced , it no longer an issue of who bangs whom and how . 
  that child has ** rights ** . 
  according to french law , one of those rights is genetic privacy . 
  even though you feed it and raise , that does n't give you the right to invade that child 's genetic privacy . 
  if you feel that you need to do that , you sue in order to break that child 's privacy . 
   having to sue your wife/girlfriend will only be even more detrimental to the relationship . 
   so if i want a paternity test in france i have to sue my wife to get it ? 
  nice exactly . 
  the child has the right to genetic privacy . 
  just because you feed it and raise it does n't give you all the rights in the world , does it ? 
   why should the guy care if it impacts a child that is not his ? 
  again - not his problem . 
  why should the child have to give his dna when it might have a negative impact on his wellbeing ? 
  just because he pays 50 % of the bills ? 
  the child is not `` defective '' . 
  it can function very well as your child . 
  should people disclose all and every health issue to their employer because he gives the money , even though it has no effect on their work life ? 
  the child , like it or not , has the right to genetic privacy . 
  even though you and your wife raise it , it still has fundamental rights that you can not infringe upon on a whim . 
  if you should desire to break that child 's privacy then you should sue ... 
   i 'm pretty sure the child wants to develop from a fetus to an infant and be born . 
  considering that for a significant chunk the foetus does n't even have a brain , i doubt it has many wants . 
   sleeping , and feeding . 
  that 's not an interesat that 's a need . 
  and as needs go they are more ** fundamental ** than your need to find out what sperm was used . 
  dude , you still did n't know where in the article you posted it talks about the ** peer reviewed ** article i mentioned . 
  tick tock . 
   the interest of the man should also be a priority it is . 
  that 's why you should be able to have one if you sue . 
  but not on a friggin whim . 
   if the child suffers it 's unfortunate but again not his problem . 
  so you agree that a pt can entail suffering for 3 individuals and have a massive impact . 
  therefore not having pt on a whim is a basic minimum . 
  be an adult and sue . 
   how can such a basic freedom can be denied to men ? 
  the child has more rights than the parents . 
  being raised by 2 parents is an important thing . 
  wanting to know what sperm was used to produce the child ... not that important . 
  if you value your sperm so much , you sue the misses . 
  this is a very serious issue that impacts 3 lives at the same time . 
  1 of those being a fragile being that has the right to the best start in life as possible . 
  so sueing is a bare minimum when talking about something that would have such a high impact . 
  then again i 'm talking to someone that spews fn propaganda . 
   i 'd frame it as part of a wider genetic scan that 'd check for diseases etc. 
  having your legal parent not be your biological one is not a genetic disease . 
  the interest of the child is to have 2 parents . 
  this interest has a priority p1 . 
  the interest of the father is to be a parent if and only if it 's his sperm . 
  that has a priority p2 . 
  p1 should be if higher priority than p2 as a default . 
  if you suspect your wife of no good , sue your misses for a paternity test . 
  the child has the right to its genetic make up . 
  call it a genetic privacy . 
  and it is under the legal custody of both you and your wife . 
  i think in france we have the correct system . 
  the interests of the child trump the interests of the parents . 
  if you want a paternity test , then you sue the misses .
