  how does google or fb make money ? 
  by selling ads . 
  ads are a big business . 
  about of a third of a movie budget goes to advertising . 
  when it costs 300 million to make one , not many industries can afford to spend 100 million on buying ads . 
  especially not in france . 
  yeah , but do you know about any chinese superhero ? 
  or indian ? 
  except those wacky bollywood movies ? 
  lets face it , culturally speaking , humans dont like originality a ton . 
  we 'll now have 7 + years of superhero movies , ugh ... 
   why ? 
  it 's cultural protectionism based in the ludicrous idea that french culture is superiour to the rest of the world 's . 
  oh god . 
  * facepalm * a us movie can afford to spend 150 million in ads alone . 
  you did n't hear about batman , about kesha or about kim kardashian because they 're amazingly good . 
  some are . 
  some arent but it 's all advertising . 
  no french or german movie can ever compete with such huge juggernauts as hollywood . 
  it 's not cultural superiority , it 's cultural diversity . 
  i dont wan na go into some secluded part of europe and ask : so what 's your fav show : himym . 
  i wan na hear about some weird show . 
  and i wan na exchange not have inner jokes . 
  france does n't have the same spending power as hollywood . 
  nobody can make a 300 million movie in france so they have to protect the little we have . 
  people want to visit france because it 's france , not because it 's tiny us with funny accents . 
   `` in german , oder englisch , i know how to count down und i 'm learning chinese now ! '', 
  i kinda feel clinton had more peaceful years . 
   i 'm quite sure you ca n't even pronounce his name correctly whats the connection ? 
  this guy is getting paid to represent his country in foreign pourparlers , negotiations etc. 
  everybody 's time is very much limited . 
  this guy will be completely left behind . 
  and the poor schlumps that work for him have to pick up his slack and coddle him . 
  his accent is awful but he at least doesnt need to read from a piece of paper . 
  foreign minister can not speak the main language of diplomacy ? 
  and it 's not phonetically equivalent . 
  who votes now for the gop that did n't for bush in 04 for example ... 
   when you couple europe 's refusal to share the financial burdern of their own security , with turkey , you can begin to see why nato may be considered a burden domestically in the usa . 
  us is free to leave nato . 
  i 'll give you gold if that happens for it will please me greatly . 
  european arms and armies cooperation would significantly increase . 
  why would the us give up this huge soft power capability ? 
  also good quote . 
  why would they want in their reunion someone that has the same hairstylist as trump ? 
   trump only claimed he would kick out anyone not committing to the 2 % nato budgetary guideline . 
  there 's no means to expel a country from nato . 
   trump has just been a little more `` forthright '' with it , to put it tactfully . 
  yeah . 
  we all know that promises during the campaign are always respected . 
  right ? 
  just like how trump just said he likes how obamacare allows insurance for preexisting conditions and also insurance for kids after the election while before he said he 'll remove it . 
  promises apply only to those who believe them . 
  just do n't gravel by the pussy . 
   mainly for free trade purposes when it was the eec , freedom of movement in different shapes and forms was already in the eec . 
  uk simply refused to understand that it was just a stepping stone and it is much better that eu and uk parted ways . 
  i 'm just messing with you man :d, 
  what a bunch of bites . 
  they actually think trump won because they memed him through ? 
  trump was supported by one of the two most massive parties in the us yet ** lost ** the popular vote . 
  in fact trump got * fewer * votes than romney . 
  le pen is backed only by the 3rd party in terms of popular support and she has to win a ** majority ** of the popular vote . 
  considering that 4 years ago she did n't even manage to win her circumscription , she 'll be dead in the water . 
  people on / r/the _ donald do n't even know how the french election is , let alone who is running  ) . 
  but i guess it 's good that they 'll spend their time on something futile like memeing for the french election instead of doing something else that might have an actual negative impact on someone . 
  i ca n't see who 's writing me . 
  i think you 're shadow banned . 
  i think i 'm being shadowbanned, 
  i mean you can go to somalia and bask in their eu given wealth , 
   they also demonized varoufakis with fake stories so varoufakis is n't a guy that 's full of himself ? 
  he 'd be the first caviar leftist that is n't like that ... 
  so i really doubt it . 
  build \u00e0 friggin nuclear aircraft carrier you dummies . 
  we had berlusconi ... we had the worse we could get . 
   every one has free market access , it 's to what extent you have free market access which is the issue , america has free market access free market access to what market ? 
  truly british politicians have * no * idea how continental politics works ( or they just lie through their teeth ) . 
  when uk joined back in the 70s , they said okay that 's it . 
  the eu wo n't change at all . 
  now that we 're in , it 's a perfect system which will forever not change . 
  now this . 
  they be funny but luckly europe can move on from this episode . 
   relatives of some of the victims are aghast . 
  over 200 signed a letter opposing it . 
  one widow expressed despair at having to see her husband 's corpse dug up to prove `` the existence of an attack that i do not believe in '' . 
  how about they let these people move on with their lives ?

  leaders that can grab 'em by the pussy ? 
  you make your pm take ryanair , romania ? 
  do you want him to declare war on ireland or something ? 
   also no mod drama probably because no mod . 
  for a while the convo was just about refugees ...

  :o] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-popular-vote/ ), 
  stepping to the plate .
