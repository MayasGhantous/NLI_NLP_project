  i heard trump is really the type that wants to get behind and grabby !, 
  [ we could have had bigger clowns !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president-elect_of_the_united_states ), 
   idiocy like that can be disastrous you think juncker voted in the us election ? 
   western governments are n't giving that money out of goodwill - we opened up our markets in exchange ask the us how much money they give mexico for opening that market through nafta . 
  close to 0 ? 
  a broken clock is right twice a day . 
   top-down federalism france do n't we also have sideways federalism ? 
  listen i know you have a new guy in that says whatever bs passes through his mind without anyone contradicting and half the us applauds how amazing and genius he is , but here 's real life . 
  go educate yourself before talking or talk only in the scope of things you know . 
  or go back to / r/the _ donald, 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_constitutional_court_crisis,_2015 so a constitutional crisis is no big problem ? 
  let 's all start some !, 
  fine . 
  it was yoyoing . 
  still the margin was pretty tight . 
   there is a reason for this system , and the us probably would n't have been as stable as it has been without it . 
  that 's full on bullshit . 
  also without it , they would n't have had bush that signed the beginning of the end of us full on supreme world power . 
  well it 's better than having a country that does n't respect the rule of law . 
  it 's completely out of my scope but sooner or later poland will buckle . 
  poland going full british , going all exitpol . 
  enacting art 50 asap therefore removing the right of work in the eu for all polish citizens . 
  all polish people ( several millions ) will have to return home ( except those skilled ones we need : docs etc. 
  they can remain if they want ) . 
  trade between the eu and poland decreases massively rendering poland much much poorer . 
  / s poland will buckle , 
  agreements do n't last until infinity . 
  the eu will block poland 's right of vote and will have another vote on whether to reduce eu funds or not . 
  i do not want my tax money to go to a country that does not respect the rule of law . 
   they 're threatening to go down on an agreement just to exert political power on poland . 
  blackmail . 
  again . 
  if i give you money and then stop , that 's not blackmail . 
  poland is free to do whatever it wants . 
  leave the eu , whatever . 
  nobody forces poland to accept eu funds , 
  eh true . 
  but i highly doubt a trade deal can be negociated in 2 years . 
  tpp lasted from 08 till late 2015 . 
  what blackmail ? 
  i 'll stop giving you money ? 
  that 's blackmail ? 
  since when is this a referendum about the euro ? 
  or have i missed some significant news ? 
  why would dems work with trump ? 
  that 's the correct question , 
   writing the same thing again does not make it more convincing . 
  oh i 'm not doing it for you   a majority opinion does not make that opinion correct . 
  a majority of ** experts ** . 
   that seems to be profoundly anti-intellectual . 
  someone who ignores the opinion of experts working in the field ( only 10-14 % tops agree that britain will be better off ) and only chooses those experts that adhere to their preconcieved notions , that 's friggin anti-intellectual . 
  economists that say uk will be better off are a minority everywhere . 
  heck even adam smith was in favour of fom of labour . 
  but that 's okay because it 's about feelings and preconcieved notions . 
  that 's the summum of intellectual behaviour . 
  cheers, 
   saying that i should agree with a majority opinion just majority opinion ** of experts ** . 
   personally i agree with those economic experts that think that the uk should leave the single market as i find their arguments more convincing yeah i also agree only with the experts that confirm my prexisting bias  . 
  makes my world seem safer you know . 
   i really , really hope that italy does n't leave . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   however , economics is not a subject in which a majority opinion makes an opinion better than a minority opinion . 
  it 's a topic where experts are better than non experts yes . 
  can you please say why you feel you 're more competent in economic matters than a whole panel of economic experts hand picked by one of the best institutions in that area of study ? 
  not as fast as the world around us !, 
  glass half full , 
   make election predictions . 
  brexit was predicted by polls to happen so i 'm not sure what you mean by `` wrong '' . 
  and us elections are just a shit show . 
  the person that ** lost ** the popular vote is president . 
  much representative democracy !, 
   could you explain how this `` help '' should look like . 
  the usual cutting off funds . 
  people are crazy . 
  they think the world is just a game of cards , with countries ready to invade on the spot . 
  more jobs for eu countries ? 
  i can stand behind that . 
   i want to leave the single market because it is harmful in and of itself . 
  wait ? 
  you doubt that the single market has made britain more rich that without ? 
  you should tell bank of england that they 're [ wrong ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34598766 ) . 
  you also disagree with quite a few economists that were [ polled ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_efotcgmoerkcztz ) . 
  but hey ... feelz  reelz like the us have shown us . 
  enjoy those vanessa paradis toblerones . 
   cheers, 
   he also had a british mother and a slovenian wife and obama a kenyan father and bojo a turkish i dunno what and sarkozy a hungarian dad . 
  that means shit ... also uk has 2 years of negociating leave starting from 2017 . 
  that means it 'll be past us mid term elections . 
  if trump loses the house ( which seems likely ) , that will slow down * anything * trump wants to do . 
  uk wo n't get any deals with the us in 2 years . 
  unless trump will win the second term election ... good luck with that, 
   the ionian of course , a 3-lane-per-direction highway you mean [ ** strada statale ** 106 jonica ] ( https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/strada_statale_106_jonica ) 3 lane highway ? 
  [ my maths classes tell me there 's 2 ] ( http://www.portale-infrastrutture.it/writable/immagini/retestradale/ss106.jpg ), 
   yes you do , it 's called cantonnement telephonique did you check the links i said ? 
  the cantonnement telephonique is doubled by [ capi ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/cantonnement_assist%c3%a9_par_informatique ) ** cantonnement assist\u00e9 par informatique ** there is n't any system where one guy calls and that 's it . 
   i thought salerno was to the south of naples wow . 
  60 km of high speed rail . 
  dude you should stop investing so much money in the south . 
  they 're rich .
