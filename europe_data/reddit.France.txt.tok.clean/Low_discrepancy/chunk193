  you sure proved me wrong man . 
   you surely know that the italian highway system is not only comprised of autostrade , right ? 
  fine . 
  what amazing * highways * do you have from taranto to calabria ? 
   in fact your own country is still working on removing it from older lines actually we do n't have any . 
  you probably mean this https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/voie_unique_%c3%a0_signalisation_simplifi%c3%a9e one line with simplified signals . 
  for any line as such , they have a phone system * and * [ a computer aided system ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/cantonnement_assist%c3%a9_par_informatique ) if the line is meant to carry passengers or dangerous cargo . 
   massive north-south investment has been attempted for decades . 
  it 's not as simple as pouring money into the south . 
  well lets see . 
  this is a map of italian cities over [ 200k with density ] ( https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/55/71755-004-a143b5e1.jpg ) . 
  here 's the map of [ high speed lines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail_in_italy#/media/file:italy_tav.png ) . 
  notice how south of naples there are n't any high speed lines over 300km ? 
  [ here 's a map of highways ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7uixf28r4d4/uuoo_yufafi/aaaaaaaaa60/_hym2efprbi/s1600/400px-rete_autostradale_italiana-labeled.svg.png ) . 
  in the north it makes nice closed loops . 
  in the south ? 
  again you have to go to naples if you want to go from bari to calabria . 
  wtf ? 
  yeah . 
  my bad , i overreached . 
  this is real life the office shit . 
  the sultan wants to bring back the good ol' band together ? 
  cuz it was all laffs and fun ? 
  it 's an honest mistake we keep making . 
  assuming uk is a representative democracy . 
   i do n't really think that 's our main issue . 
  you did n't tackle / u/elvishcopter 's main point : centralisation . 
  italy suffers badly from that north south imbalance . 
  massively investing there offers great potential for growth . 
  ffs , the reason you had that train accident a few months ago is because regional trains in that area are controlled by a friggin phone system between the stations . 
  are you people for real ? 
  you 're the 3rd economy in the eurozone and that 's how you do rail in that part of the country ? 
   so everyone in the centre and in the west ? 
  do n't those people want to have their own country or something ? 
  why not talk about the best of each country ( well the major ones i can say something significant about :p ) : * belgium : they 're our little cousins . 
  they 're family . 
  * spain : the country that for better or worse it spread its culture in some of the most amazing corners of the world . 
  * italy : [ when you touch tips ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mont_blanc ) you know you have a special relationship . 
  it 's the country that i absolutely love . 
  cuisine , culture , people . 
  cinecitta , sergio leone , * germany : some of the most exceptional scientists and mathematicians to have graced this earth . 
  we still have this rivalry but it 's becoming more affectionate.before we 'd probably be obsessed by uk but nowadays slowly slowly germany fills that role . 
  * england specifically : one of our oldest enemies , one our closest allies . 
  they simply make the best english speaking sitcoms , some of the best music . 
  english humor is just so on point : monty python , fawlty towers , the office . 
  mike leigh is also one of the best directors and some of the most powerful movies are made in britain , meantime , secrets and lies , trainspotting . 
  [ penne ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/whole_wheat_penne,_cooked_and_uncooked.jpg/250px-whole_wheat_penne,_cooked_and_uncooked.jpg ), 
   1 out of an entire staff [ you 're the orange guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttola3tyfqq&amp;t=1m15s ), 
   most of their votes come from russians !, 
  are they citizens of your country ? 
   i 'm saying she has a more-than-zero chance . 
  of course . 
  what if sarko wins the ump nomination , and hollande chooses to run , and an unprecedented wave of terrorist attacks hit france ? 
  but the way things are set now , jupp\u00e9 to beat sarko and severely trashing le pen in the second round . 
  again , unlike trump that is a huge unknown , le pen is very well known , she 's been in elections etc. 
  and unlike brexit and us elections we have a second round where people are asked : `` are you reeeeally sure about your choice man ? 
  no turning back ! '', 
  want a wager ? 
   we did n't create a ton of disenfranchised amongst the population that votes . 
   as a few preventable terrorist attacks ? 
  exactly . 
  ** after the worst terrorist attacks ** france has ever gone through , ** le pen and her strong guard still lost ** the regional elections . 
  if jupp\u00e9 wins the right primaries , it 's game over for her . 
  telling you dude , that second round saves lives . 
  the first round you pick , the second round you eliminate . 
  and she 's always eliminated . 
  but against jupp\u00e9 , the margin is ** huge **, 
   you 're only an ally if you can be counted on okay . 
  where was the us in ukraine and georgia ? 
  georgia was when bush said he 'd push for the country to join nato . 
   look at all the polling , the french have no appetite to help . 
  looking at the elections , the americans have little appetite to help . 
  do n't piss off your allies , 
  we 're not the us nor the uk . 
  we did n't piss off our old white people . 
  we love putin ... to death !, 
  pissing off allies is never a good idea ... 
  you do n't ? 
  head to head , jupp\u00e9 is set to win the primary . 
  reminds me of the crash during a test run of a tgv near strasbourg last year , the day after the paris attacks . 
  news would only eventually talk about it . 
  the republic knows !, 
  i am french after all . 
  and unlike the brits or americans , we 're not batshit crazy , 
   i assume the gop will try to keep trump have they ever managed to keep trump on any line ? 
  so poland ... about those helicopters ... 
   how can you say with a straight face that france does n't have disenfranchised voters ? 
  did i say that ? 
  show me where i said that . 
   it 's not just the muslim `` youths '' that are disenfranchised . 
  just like blacks , mexicans or young people , muslims do n't vote . 
   the white french do their fair share of car-burning and rioting too . 
  you 'll have to tell me when that happened ...  all le pen needs to do is sufficiently erode peoples trust in juppe/sarkozy/whatever other dodgy politician the right-wing wheel out and the result could end up being a lot closer than you think . 
  le pen has a much bigger hill to climb but we should know by now not to assume that we know what the electorate really thinks . 
  dude , like it or not , there are not enough french people willing to burn the system down . 
  le pen against jupp\u00e9 is losing . 
  le pen is well an old politician by now . 
  we already had an election with her . 
  we know here . 
  she 's not new like trump .
