  polls institutes know what to expect and how to correct for results . 
  and france has ** 2 ** rounds . 
  meaning she 'll get eaten alive at the second round . 
  fn can barely get 50 % in their home towns when elections happen , they wo n't get 50 % * nation wide * . 
  and fn has started to be involved in scandals itself . 
  so they can no longer pretent they 're fresh and clean . 
  basically every poll shows jupp\u00e9 winning the first round , and every poll shows him winning against le pen . 
  of course it 's easy to say it wo n't happen , when it has n't happened . 
  but if you want we 'll talk again in 2017 , may . 
  meaninwhile jupp\u00e9-le pen , [ she is n't breaking 40 % in ** any ** poll ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_de_sondages_sur_l'%c3%a9lection_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_fran%c3%a7aise_de_2017#jupp.c3.a9_-_le_pen ), 
  yeah . 
  white people . 
  white people and older people . 
  they 're the ones that vote . 
  like i said :  we did n't create a ton of disenfranchised amongst the population that votes . 
   uk returning to the eu ? 
  not going to happen . 
  nor should it . 
  with smaller toblers , your waist line will improve . 
  god know , you brits need it : s, 
  neah . 
  trump will leave in 4-8 years . 
  brexit ... that fo ' life baby . 
  toothless toblerones for everybody !, 
  if sarko wins the primary and hollande chooses to run again , i 'll start being worried . 
  but i reeeeeaally do n't think it 'll happen . 
  after the regional elections , fn has not won a single region ... even though the heavy weights of the party were running : philippot , marion , aliot . 
  even after the worst terrorists attacks . 
  they did n't win and fn wo n't win . 
  france is not uk nor is it the us . 
  we 're not doing great but we did n't create a ton of disenfranchised amongst the population that votes . 
   after brexit and trumpwin i can even see a front national win in france . 
  wo n't happen . 
  second round best round !, 
  yeah i think you touch some very important aspects . 
  we 're told how extreme poverty deacreased , how the world has never been better . 
  yet [ young people in uk ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/18/millennials-earn-8000-pounds-less-in-their-20s-than-predecessors ) may be the first generation that earns less than their parents . 
  inequality increases in europe in the us . 
  and the thing is , at elections , it 's not the african , chinese or brazilian that votes . 
  and as whites lose their footing in the middle class , the blacks , muslims , mexicans , eastern europeans , they do n't see their status improving , so they wo n't vote . 
  [ also moore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy-cipvo_nq ), 
   i could be wrong , but it would be very difficult to have another trump . 
  after today , it will be very difficult to pander to the `` anti-establishment '' crowd again . 
  sure it 's 4 years for the us . 
  but brexit is for infinity ... 
  [ well he 's shit as a political analyst , but he has a future in the drole one liner business ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=xvgnoqccycm&amp;t=1m24s ), 
   it seems to be upsetting large portions that 's what infuriates me , when i see people like clinton or obama assuming the elections have happened before they did . 
  [ guess trump is * a * president now ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=xvgnoqccycm&amp;t=1m24s ) obama should have spent less time messiah-ing about and making cute one liners . 
  because again it 's about appearances . 
  people still can not comprehend that groups can do more than a single individual . 
  there 's a reason why the nobel committee refuses still to give nobel awards to scientific groups and just individual people . 
  people see the president a single figure and assume that he is the most important person . 
  and considering how powerful the us president is ... 
  why was the media allowed to spin bs ? 
  why is the political landscape so polarised ? 
  and i also do n't think that 's enough ... 
  i 'm still betting that growing inequalities ( aka relative poverty ) have a huge part in why trump was elected or brexit happened . 
   but the man is a blithering idiot . 
  two of the main political figures of leave campaign was * bojo . 
  the guy who basically won but still his career is dead . 
  * farange a guy who wants to protest against a friggin judicial procedure . 
  all from a referendum started by a a dude that wanted to use it as a tool to further advance his own political career . 
  an eton-oxbridge egomaniac that though he had the feel of the people . 
  just like with trump where you do n't know what you 'll get , you have brexit which again you do n't know what you 'll get . 
  and you can say hey le pen . 
  but at least with her , if we become suddenly retarded and vote for her , we 'll at least know what we 'll get . 
   hillary 's problem was low turnout from minorities and she was way more popular with black and latino voters compared to sanders nope . that 's us ' problem . 
  did the social status of black people increase ? 
  or other minorities ? 
  it was neither . 
  it was greenspan that fucked you over . 
  i really think this is th\u00e9 moment where we put aside that cheap shots and jokes . 
  we all know that trump won despite trump . 
  we just have to really understand why trump and brexit won . 
  we have 4 years of shit memes and he wo n't stop providing . 
  tl ; dr : can we please be fucking serious for once and attack the problem ? 
  even the friggin mods that said ** no memes ** is replying with a meme . 
   so was obama not really no . 
  obama was n't in favour of it . 
  but he gave the go ahead . 
   there 's not been a major war . 
  heard she was in favour for lybia . 
  also obama kept her on a tight leash . 
   if you want to deploy them to the middle east or sub saharan africa , you have the capability to go to the pacific . 
  it 's that simple i stopped reading right there . 
  cheers . 
   to deploy troops quickly elsewhere didbi say anywhere ? 
  we have 0 interest to be able to send troops in the pacific etc. 
  all the areas i 've mentioned can be reached by plane . 
  spain and italy need to up their carrier capabilities . 
   aircraft and warships !, 
  f22 type planes and nimitz class carriers are over kill . 
  that 's the new toblerone [ bumping key ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/bumping_key.jpg/300px-bumping_key.jpg ) you have to shove it in your mouth and it 'll unlock your hunger or something . 
  with vw you 're driving more cheat than car . 
   if you had talked to them earlier on and put effort into educating them rather than laughing about their stupidity , things would have been easier in the end . 
  yes . 
  because they 're all stupid and need to be explained everything ... just like with anti-vaxxers right ? 
  [ which happen to be more educated than theaverage ] ( http://voxday.blogspot.fr/2015/12/anti-vaxxers-are-more-educated.html ), 
  our purpose is n't to build a fleet of aircraft carriers and fleets upon fleets of the most overpriced airplanes . 
  we just need : * a nuclear umbrella * cyberattack , surveillance , military satellite capabilities * capability to deploy troops ( but not full on armies ) quickly in africa , eastern europe , and me .
