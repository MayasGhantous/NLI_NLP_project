   western sahara is giant occupied territory wait what ? 
  the french mission in mali has been a success . 
  stop bitching . 
   living under the nuclear umbrella provided by the burgermeisters has worked well and freed resources to build other things like the eu . 
  you should grow a pair and [ stop ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32529277 ) being [ us ' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32542140 ) little [ spying lapdog ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/germany-accused-of-spying-on-france-and-engaging-in-industrial-espionage-on-behalf-of-nsa ), 
  should be yellow then . 
  if that were the case , explain the us election . 
  or explain texans that put creationism in their school text books . 
   death threats and incitement of the masses are ` perspectives from the other side of the spectrum ' . 
  if the spectrum goes from neo-nazis to people calling for jihad . 
  then yeah it 's the other side of the spectrum . 
  that 's crazy . 
  well this will break the monopoly and that 's a good thing . 
   the fall in the pound means you 've suffered a capital loss and your investment is now worth less . 
  pepsico is higher now than after/before brexit . 
  why would you include your assets in the dividends that are being paid ? 
  :d . do you have unicorns in your fantasy world ? 
   this one was heavily influenced by the american one and the greek one and it was created by a collabo, 
   you 've missed the entire point . 
  i fully understand your point . 
  dreyfus affair is a case where the military justice and later the civil justice system iirc had a full and total meltdown because of the highest level of corruption . 
  if resulted in a profound crisis in the state . 
  it was ** not democracy ** but a complete meltdown of a judicial , political and societal system . 
  a failure of what came before it . 
  this is what happens when people lose trust in the judicial system . 
  ** trust ** is the * corner stone * of any democratic system . 
  the judicial system might fail people ( just like it failed them during the extra judiciary killings after ww2 ) , but ** trust ** is essential . 
  ** trust and repsect ** of what the courts decide . 
  when they fall , you get the terror regime where you decapitate left and right and that will fall down , you get the dreyfus affair where the country was on the verge of collapse , you get vichy and the civil war at that time . 
  so if you want to instill that grain of doubt that judges can be biased , congratulations you 're on the path france has known quite a few times . 
   protesting it 's decisions is not a danger to democracy , opposing those protests is . 
  can you friggin step down a little and look at ** what ** you are protesting ? 
  you are protesting the * unbiased ** nature of your judges ? 
  do you even comprehend how serious of a matter this is ? 
  that your judges can not perform their ** only ** mission : judge cases in an impartial manner based on ** on the rule of the law ** . 
  i do n't think you really understand the gravity of the matter , so i 'll stop here . 
  good day, 
   here 's a pertinent example from the history of your country , the judicial branch is not flawless and should be subject to debate , just ike every other organ of the state . 
  1898 france and europe is n't 2016 uk and europe . 
  or do your mean to say that a court giving a sentence today in uk has as much validity as a court that sentences a polish to death for hiding jews in the 1940s ? 
   judiciary in a democracy , it 's a part of the government the judicial branck is not part of the govt . 
  separation of powers . 
  it 's pointless to protest anything and putting any sort of pressure on the judicial branch is extremely dangerous . 
   i was simply bringing up the fact that people will protest against laws that are already in place , that 's all . 
  again , if you protest to change a law that 's perfectly fine and happens all the time . 
  but you go protest those * who make the laws * . 
  you do n't protest judges ** in a judicial procedure ** . 
  you do n't protest ** decisions of judges ** . 
  even in that case , ** no one ** is protesting at a gay wedding . 
  or telling mayors to not officiate . 
  if you wan na protest the parliament to change laws , be my guest . 
  that 's normal ** and will change something ** . 
  protesting a judge ** will change nothing ** . 
   people protest against the law of the land do you understand the difference between protesting a political process like passing laws and ** protesting a judicial process ** that means the application of those laws ? 
  surely it 's not complicated to understand . 
  once a law is a law , ** the judges must follow that law ** . 
   they do n't give a shit about your self obsessed bullshit . 
  of course not . 
  i do n't get what the big deal is . 
  just buy a store brand of chips . 
  it 's not like you * have to buy * that brand . 
  they 're part of the 5 eyes . 
  and since us agencies have a harder time spying on their own citizens ( because of law reasons ) they actually have massively invested in gchq so they can do the spying on us citizens for them . 
   bit odd , given that britain can produce potatoes and vegetable oil . 
  that just means that taters and oil are cheaper . 
  you , living in france can therefore import more and start your own chips brand . 
  walkers is owned by pepsico a company that most likely declares profits in euros or dollars and pays dividends in euros or dollars . 
  if the pound drops that means the profits declared are lesser in the other currency meaning that the dividends paid are lesser meaning people will sell their pepsico stocks meaning pepsico drops in value . 
   the main bulk of the packet comes entirely from within the uk oh for fucks sake . 
  not this again . 
  walkers is owned by [ pepsico ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/walkers_ ( snack_foods \\ ) ) . 
  pepsico is a foreign company so it will ** declare its profits ** in dollars ( most likely ) or euros if it 's owned by pepsico europe . 
  if the pound is 20 % less , that means ** the profits declared are less ** which means that they have to raise prices . 
  they do n't give a shit if the goods are made in uk . 
  they pay dividends in euros or dollars . 
  if that bothers you , do n't buy it . 
  sorry man . 
  i know nothing about cameras : s, 
  uv filters would reduce light with a certain wave length . 
  these eliminate light with a certain type of polarisation, 
  i mean stupid people can do whatever they want . 
  that 's how you recognize them . 
   he does n't believe the judiciary are neutral in this case his beliefs , he can shove up his ass . 
  a person , 100k people , 200k people , 65m people do not get to tell what the justice system decides . 
  when the justice system has rendered its verdict and after all appeals have been used , that 's it , you stfu . 
   which is normally expressed through parliament except when there has been a referendum . 
  i fail to understand how people can think their own beliefs can overrule the cummulated expertise of people whose friggin job is to decide on this matter . 
  how can a trader ( farage ) think he is more capable than the people on the supreme court ? 
  will he pull a jobs when doctors detect something wring with him ? 
   if these guys do it its wrong you do n't fucking protest decisions of the justice system . 
  also who the fuck are the 100k people to protest the decision of friggin ** constitutional experts ** . 
   peaceful protest is part of a democracy of a judicial decision ? 
  since when ? 
  protesting is a political process . 
  and the justice system is completely removed from political processes . 
   largely being tolerated by officials in various european countries , mainly due to a distorted view on the organization being promoted as one that promotes the rights of kurds . 
  in france we gave asylum to many pkk members because they were tortured by the turkish police .

  why do you think was one of the reasons they were refused the kc contract . 
  0.1 % * 200 = 0.2 we can cripple one !,
