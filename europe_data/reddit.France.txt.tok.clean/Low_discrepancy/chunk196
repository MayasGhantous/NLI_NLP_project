  extrajudicial killing ? 
  are you absolutely sure ? 
   why it has an assembly plant for a319 's , 320 's , and 321 's in the us . 
  that was a condition to break in the us market . 
  the same reason why they built assembly plants in china . 
  unlike europe where we do n't really impose that type of thing for boeing . 
   somewhat less of a honeypot for politicians , airbus ? 
  did you miss the whole scandal with boeing and the us ? 
  or how the us gave the contract for new tanker planes only to backtrack ridiculously . 
  or how poland decided to cancel an extremely favourable contract for jets ? 
  or when eads tried to merge bae and they were blocked ? 
  no politics ? 
   we need to think more like airbus airbus also has long supply chains . 
  with parts being built in france , germany , spain and uk . 
   it was dedication to persist and to work together . 
  yes . 
  it was n't germany giving money to france and telling them : guys go build a plane . 
  thx see you in 10 years . 
   well , i do expect occitanie to give money to \u00cele-de-france while being told hey do n't worry we 'll take good care of it why do n't we just give money to the us and let them build everything . 
  seems like the optimal solution . 
   france as a whole will make greater things than auvergne-rh\u00f4ne-alpes , nord-pas-de-calais-picardie , normandie you fail to understand that keeping everybody involved makes everybody be part of it . 
  when a project fucks up like several did fuck up , everybody is in the loop . 
  if a country just gives the money and is not in the loop what incentive does it have to keep investing when fuckups occur other than ... we 'll put your flag on the rocket guys !, 
   with thinking like this the entire continent will become a flyover region hahahahhahaha ... hahahahhahaha . 
  good one . 
  ` member after the war when all our major scientists went to the us and only 2 major superpowers existed and europe was in ruins ? 
  if we managed to survive that and build top notch technology , i 'm preeeeeetty sure we 'll survive a somewhat long supply chain , 
   but they could do much better if they were actually in for the projects and not to support their own little national space industries . 
  that 's a ridiculous claim . 
  we 're 20 some nations that have to pool resources . 
  it 's ridiculous to claim that it 's not important who gets what . 
  the reason a lot of launcher parts/engines are french made is because well ... we make our own icbms . 
  we will forever want to keep those resources even though it costs a great deal of money . 
   competitors make strides while we discuss for years if assembly line x should go to european country a or neighbouring european country b. 
  it 's a bit disheartening . 
  it is part of the process . 
  i do not expect spain to give money while being told hey do n't worry , we 'll take good care of it and we 'll put your flag on the rocket . 
  win-win . 
  it is part of the reality that is the european project , and we can lament and complain but it 's the reality and that 's the context needed to work . 
  we can complain that russia and the us had to build space projects in parallel , we can complain that the space shuttle was basically a failure because of shifting political goals etc etc etc but things have to move on and the engineers have to consider the political context . 
  so spacex will come and produce this wonderfully amazing exceptional rocket that will put everybody out of business ... 
  okay ... it 's not like onlye europe will suffer ... so will american companies . 
  and either way that 's life . 
  we 'll find other projects to work on and move on . 
  unlike the us , we ca n't really afford creating a huge flyover part for our continent with only 2 regions that will matter . 
  europe competes with politically driven top-down `` cooperation '' to generate a remarkably out-of-date design at the same time as stringent government regulation inhibits innovation in the private sector and has led to mass unemployment . 
  yeah airbus is such an obsolete design ... 
   airbus has a horrible track record of managing mega projects like this ( hello , a400m ) what 's with all the circlejerkers on this thread ? 
  we can also point to boeing 's utter failure with dreamliner 's batteries and shout how boeing will be a disaster . 
  all companies have their ups and downs and pointing to one project to talk about another is retarded . 
  what would dory do ? 
  what if jupp\u00e9 wins the nomination though :(, 
  the belgians would reply to your banter but i guess they 're too busy [ exchanging with us instead ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59boyx/who_do_europeans_joke_about_most_xpost_from/ ), 
   funny how when confronted with arguments you stop pretending to be i just realised i got sidetracked by / u/nico2845 's arguments that are ** totally irrelevant to the main ** discussion . 
  the french are still very much in love with politics and still very much invested in politics . 
  we go voting more at the elections ** we think are the most important ** more than the elections brits , germans , americans think are the most important to them . 
  if you wan na have a 3 yo discussion about what superhero has the best superpower and can beat all the other superhero 's , be my guest . 
  if you wan na think you won that discussion , also be my guest . 
  but at least the revolutionary wars did n't result in the monarchy being reinstated . 
  we managed to beat several massive powers . 
  another one . . 
  here let me help you out . 
  # it does n't fucking matter . 
  it does n't matter who has more power compared to whom . 
  people go voting for the election they think is the most important . 
  that 's why brits went to vote for the brexit ref more than general elections even though the ref was non binding . 
  and the americans went to the vote for congress in mid term elections with a turnout of 36 % compared to the presidential of 54 % ( and we can have the same mind numbingly retarded debate on who has the most power ) . 
  and in france people ** think ** the presidential is more important than the parliament so that 's why ** they 'll go vote ** more to the presidential . 
  now can we drop this stupid dick measuring contst that is n't even the point of the thread ? 
   cohabitation , where the government is from the party of parliament , not of the president , and where the president has very few powers . 
  and he can dissolve the na and call for new elections . 
  what can the parlament do if they do n't like the president ? 
   those frenchmen had every right to be angry at the french government for forcing them to partake in the war . 
  they fought for the glory of france . 
  the contract was respected . 
  before engaging the war , italy offered savoie , the french also asked for nice . 
  the agreement was signed . 
  the war was fought and won . 
  the regions were given . 
   if one thinks people and their homes are tradeable like cattle are you new to the history of europe or something ? 
  savoie changed hands ( at least ) 3 times in a 100 years before 1861 . 
  italy asked for help and offered regions . 
  ( also nice had a referendum . ), 
   of course , he was . 
  nice was his hometown still weird . 
  the demands of the french were known beforehand at the [ plombi\u00e8res agreements ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/accordi_di_plombi%c3%a8res ) . 
  plus we have a nice square with his name in nice . 
   the british played a role in negotiations too . 
  and how many died during those negociations :p, 
  well i mean let 's look at history here . 
   the first ( where a union of italian states fought austria ) ended with status quo , is a war that [ you lost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_italian_war_of_independence ) even though you had an advantage in numbers . 
  so now you had to seek allies . 
  france stepped to the plate and now you had 170k frenchmen , 2k cavalry , 312 cannons compared to the 70k sardinians , 4k cavarly and 90 cannons . 
  the austrians had 220k men , 22k cavalry and some 800 cannons . 
  and that ended with a victory . 
  seems like nice and savoie are a fair price . 
  garibaldi was pissed but the frenchmen that died for a war that was n't exactly theirs ... how about them ? 
   it basically was the kingdom of sardinia against austria [ 170k french and 70k sardinians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_italian_war_of_independence ) = kingdom of sardinia ? 
  that maths does n't work out man . 
   the french invasion of spain and then another invasion to restore absolutis guess we were successful where you [ failed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_revolutionary_wars ) .
