   why you do n't just attack them ? 
  yeah why not just attack russian backed troops . 
  [ cuz it worked so well last time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_war ), 
   mumbo-jumbo nonsense about how the `` economy is different '' this is the last comment before i ignore you . 
  you are unbelievably obnoxious and you should get your personality in check . 
  france is the only european country that makes its own nuclear subs , its own ballistic missiles , its own nuclear war heads , its own nuclear propelled aircraft carrier , its own nuclear powerplants , it was the only european country to have a 3 nuclear delivery system : land , air , sea . 
  it basically owns the main electricity provider , it created one of the best train networks from scratch and it owns the main train operator , it makes its own fighterplanes , it was greatly invested in its airplane , car industry , space launcher system . 
  it also has one of the best healthcare systems in the world which does tend to cost a lot . 
  the fact that france could be so heavily invested in so many different industries and managed to do so much in so many varied fields is due to france 's dirigist economy . 
  it 's the only reason we can stand toe to toe to germany without becoming an italy or being an us pawn only relevant because of one economic activity ( finance ) like uk . 
  it 's also the only reason we 're independent from the us in terms of our military protection which is unprecedented for a country of 60 million people . 
  there are 3 major blocks : us , russia , china . 
  and france can stand alone . 
  that being said , do n't bother replying cuz you 're blocked . 
  have a nice day . 
  cheers , 
   why you 're so ferociously keen on reducing the wage of the average worker by taxing corporations instead of taxing the corporation owners i honestly believe that companies will fill the gap and decide to pay their workers more while reducing the dividents to pay the corporate tax . 
  we were talking about govt expenditure here . 
   yet they very rarely do . 
  true they prefer [ monaco ] ( http://www.monte-carlo.mc/en/business-congress/tax-system/ ) and switzerland . 
  and after that , you 'll come and explain that dividend tax also creates distortions and we should remove them because it makes people less likely to invest ... 
   from the guy who 's flying on his private jet the guy who can declare he lives in cayman islands ? 
  yeah i 'm sure it 'll be super easy to tax that guy ... 
   it does completely seal off the mediterranean coast to any nato enemies i mean there 's still syria so the base russia has is even more important . 
  if clinton were to even try to impose a no fly zone , sparks will fly . 
   that the french economy is different because of the cea . 
  can you point where i claimed that ? 
   then why did you mention it at all ? 
  why do you think ? 
   and for simply doing that , we were called traitors by thatcher :( i hope you 're not british because sarcasm really * is n't * your strong point . 
   let 's say it 's 100 euros : does that mean that the corporation owners will receive 100 euros less in dividends ? 
  does it mean that the corporation employees receive 100 euros less in waves ? 
  does that mean consumers paid 100 euros through higher prices ? 
  it has to be either each one of those or a combination ; syaing `` it 's the corporation '' is empty nonsense : the corporation is just a conduct , a passage through which the money travels ; if a corporation is paying 100 in taxes , those 100 will be coming out of someone 's pocket . 
  tax on revenu for married people is calculated for the revenu of the ** whole ** family . 
  they fill one form . 
  so who pays ? 
  the husband ? 
  the wife ? 
  the children ? 
  ** who cares **  again , the company only pays nominally the familu only pays nominally . 
   for some reason , you prefer that the truck driver pays it . 
  that 's the choice the company makes . 
  no one forces the company to lower wages . 
   he corporate income tax means that the driver is earning less for the company to pay the tax , so yes , he 's indeed paying the road . 
  it is a choice the company makes . 
   yes but you ca n't have an / r/europe thread without shitting on the uk , no matter how unrelated . 
  you brits are touchy people . 
  you even get offended at numbers . 
  compared to french elections you have lower turnouts . 
  uk 's most important election got 66 % turnout in 2015 . 
  the most important french election got 79 % in 2012 . 
  quick get upset again, 
  this is the topic . 
  thatcher had a reason to be upset ( even though mitterrand did not support the technical team that remained there and the weapons were ** sold before the war ** ) and the germans have a reason to be upset in this case , 
  are you really surprised germans are upset when a german goes against them ? 
  uk also sells tech to kill people :(, 
   value of currency = economy ? 
  huge variations ... baaaaaad, 
   stuart claims she has been called a traitor by eu supporters in the uk and abroad . 
  a german brexiter was called a traitor ? 
  we had the same issue in france . 
  we were just being fair business people . 
  we supplied technologic products to a country . 
  and when you supply technologic products you also have to send teams there to do the maintenance . 
  and for simply doing that , we were called traitors by thatcher :(, 
   because of the cea ? 
  do you know what the cea does ? 
   if it 's the latter , are you mentally well ? 
  if you insult people , you will be ignored . 
   i 've experienced that before as a brit you were reminded in what country you are when you were impolite ? 
  usually in france you hear : `` one says hello when getting on the bus '' , `` one says hello before ordering bread '' . 
  i guess we generally know in what country we are . 
   i 'm sure you 'll soon explain what exactly that difference is and what makes the french economy so special . 
  let me help you clear the fog . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-innovation-rankings-iduskcn0wa2a5 see the most innovative govt research institute ** in the world ** ? 
  do you know what cea does ? 
  several of your links do not work . 
  that being said :  you ca n't tax a corporation ; you can only tax a person . 
  there is n't * one * type of juridic personality . 
  there are several https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_personality and coorporations are one type of them . 
  so that statement is ridiculous . 
  corporate tax is just a way to pay the risk the state is taking ... a company has to hire people , needs a healthy work force , the borders need be protected , needs roads , infrastructure etc. 
  if a truck driver drives on the road who should pay for that ? 
  the driver ? 
  the company should . 
  so there is ideologic reasoning why the corporate tax should exist . 
  but i 'll have to plead ignorance on this topic . 
  if corporate tax is eliminated but other taxes are increased ... okayish . 
  all your articles which i do n't have time to peruse ( so i 'll plead ignorance ) do n't seem to inform on what the optimal corporate tax should be . 
  only optimal tax theory can suggest such a level -  0 . but if it 's like any other type of economic theory then it ignores a lot of realities . 
   fortunately the trend is clear , and policy tends to follow the consensus in academic economics http://rooseveltinstitute.org/reforming-taxation-promote-growth-and-equity/ stieglitz argues for a corporate tax . 
  [ picketty ] ( http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/fichiers/dellboziopiketty2006.pdf ) argues for a capital tax . 
   i put the corporate income tax on the same tier of teaching creationism in science classes . 
  oh ... the day economists will all agree on something will be a magnificent day . 
  let 's all recall the [ 2013 nobel prizes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:2013_nobel_prize_winners ) where fama argued that economic bubbles do not exist and hansen , the guy he shared the prize with , for his work on studing bubbles . 
  brilliant . 
   all countries known for their constant shortage of doctors , soldiers and teachers . 
  those are ** different ** countries with a different economic structure  saying we can all apply the same economic principles is ** stupid ** . 
  the fact that they have ** different ** structures is obvious with the case of the us .
