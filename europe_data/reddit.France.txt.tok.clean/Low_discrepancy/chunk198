  corporate tax us : 30 % corporate tax france : 30 % govt expenditure us : 35 % govt expenditure france 50 % see , even with the same corporate tax , they have ** different ** economies so they have to apply ** different ** policies . 
   t 's like saying the intern who wrote a report for the ceo has the real power , because the ceo only approves or disproves it . 
  sounds ridiculous right ? 
  yeah when you make bullshit comparisons , you get bullshit results . 
  huuuuuge surprise right there . 
  i also love that you think the ceo is the parliament when actually the ceo is the president and the administration board is the parliament . 
  tell us more how knowledgeable you are in how organisations work ...  the government can not set a budget that does n't satisfy mps , they have to comply by what they want or not . 
  and the parliament can not set any govt . 
  that suuucks . 
  then the president can dismiss the national assembly and call for new elections . 
  so na can not fire the president but the president can fire the na which the more powerful of the 2 chambers ... 
  the president clearly is an intern ... 
  listen i 'll stop this pointless convo and i 'll stop talking to you . 
   and if the government does n't have the majority , it ca n't do anything . 
  it can very well use state decrees . 
   the government can try to set the tone , but if it 's not followed by the parliament it 's done . 
  can it say : oh teachers should teach this , and what can the parlament do , besides say no ? 
  again it can not set any tone ...  because parliament has far more power than the president , countries where it 's the opposite are called dictatorship , you might have heard of it . 
  have you heard of separation of powers though ? 
  means different bodies have different powers . 
   you 're electing the person who is going to represent you and vote the laws in your name at the parliament . 
  they basically just approve or disprove . 
  who sets the budgets ? 
  who sets the main goals ? 
  parliament just gives the go ahead . 
   who cares who initiated laws ? 
  again 90 % of the laws are n't initiated by the parliament . 
  the govt sets the tone on how the country will be run in the next 5 years . 
  it 's ridiculous to claim otherwise . 
   which is why legislative are the most important elections in terms of power . 
  there is n't a more important election . 
  it 's a separation of powers . 
   she 's just a pompous cow . 
  well now she 'll know she should be polite . 
   they gave us top gear . 
  sadly you gave them sabine ... 
  who needs an id/drivers permit every 4 years . 
  and i 'm sure people say : hey sign me up for that election in 3 years . 
  thanks . 
  did you bother reading the comment ? 
  you do n't need an id but you need to register beforehand . 
  which leads to ridiculously low turnout rates . 
  us does n't have a national id . 
  on the continent everybody has ids . 
  it 's just something you must get when you 're 12-14-16 . 
  you can not function without one . 
  applying for uni ? 
  opening a bank account ? 
  buying alcohol , cigs ? 
  going on a plane , id . 
  it 's a bit like a birth certificate and i do n't know anyone who does n't have an id . 
   america without even having an official government identification and ? 
  there 's a strong correlation between same day registration and voter turnout . 
  and us voter turnouts are * ridiculous * . 
  70 % for what ? 
  i 'm sure americans could offer more information but the fact that only [ 16/50 ] ( https://ballotpedia.org/same-day_voter_registration ) states offer same day registration and that voting happens on tuesdays which is maintained as a workday counts for a huge lot . 
   60 % which is a shame because that 's really where it matters , in terms of powers . 
  [ less than 10 % of laws voted by parliament are initiated by the parliament ] ( https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/loi#l.27initiative ) the most important laws passed have been propositions of the govt : * abortion made legal : simone veil health minister * gay marriage taubira justice minister * retirement reforms : various govts * abolition of death penalty : mitterrand * labour reforms : macron of course these are a selection but they 've either been massive or have create a huge uproar in society . 
   does that mean that french people trust their politics ? 
  we still consider politics to be hugely important for us . 
   it 's ridiculous to compare our presidential election with the brexit referendum , these are completely different votes . 
  yes when is vastly more important and it 'll span decades into the future of the country . 
  the other we do every 5 years , * twice * . 
   mps , the people who , you know , are voting and making the bills that affect us all , only 58 % showed up . 
  that 's normal . 
  it 's the second most important election . 
  popularity drops off . 
  election fatigue sets in . 
   why do you think french people are so blas\u00e9s with their politics ? 
  are we though ? 
  last presidential election we had 79 % turnout and we were already talking about how low it was . 
  uk had a referendum with 73 % turnout in a massively important decision and they were saying how high this was . 
  us presidential elections ? 
  they have n't had over 60 % since 1968 ( for a country that prides how democratic they are , they sure love restricting voting ) . 
  we are a very political country ( much more than any others i 'd say ) , we just had this summer several hundred people occupy a square in paris in order to talk politics . 
  during the retirement law projects , the protests would regularly get over 2 million and a couple of times over 3 million people in the streets of france . 
  we 're a loud bunch and we love our politics . 
  and like everything you love , when you 're a bit disappointed ... you 're actually feeling that you 're extremely disappointed . 
   almost everyone has lower wages in romania . 
  romania would have to pay literally more than 10x the average wage in order to match those countries a resident student gets paid as much as the cleaning woman http://m.stirileprotv.ro/lbin/mobile/index.php?article_id=3692721 they ** do n't have money ** to raise salaries . 
  but continue praising the gods for how low taxes are in romania . 
  the lost 10000 doctors but gained 1 brit so clearly they 're doing something right . 
   but in return you get one of the best educations the world has to offer . 
  we 're talking here about what results you get for similar costs . 
  listen you 're trolling here and in other convos . 
  you have a very limited knowledge of how romania actually works and the severe problems crippling that society . 
  or maybe you do live in a world cocooned in bucharest and also think 57 billion is a tiny amount of money . 
  totally manageable to lose it . 
  fucking half a trillion in 10 years is chump change . 
  but from the other side it seems like you just love to profit . 
  profit from high salaries while living in a country with very low tax that forces its very able and educated class to move abroad . 
  a country that invests very little in education and r&d . if you can live like that , perfect . 
  but if the vast majority of humanity would do what you are , society would crumble . 
  pipe down and enjoy the ride , it wo n't last for too long . 
   to me it looks like it 's 125 % of your military budget . 
  including pensions or not ? 
   that 's not really how budgets work , you would n't take everything away from the same place . 
  so we 'll just have 30 % fewer docs , 30 % fewer soldiers and 30 % fewer teachers . 
  awesome . 
  listen i 'll pretend i never read your comments because they 're ridiculous .
