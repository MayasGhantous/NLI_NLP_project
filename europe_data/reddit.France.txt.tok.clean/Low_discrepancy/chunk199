  cheers . 
   treatment was very good . 
  ah yes it is nice cuz you 're in bucharest . 
  how about the fact that romania is a bit more than a city of 1.9 million people ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/07/romanian-health-service-crisis-doctors-uk http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-health-system-lost-10000-doctors-to-higher-salaries-abroad/ http://www.vice.com/read/why-are-romanian-doctors-leaving-the-country romania lost ** 1/3 ** of its doctors since 2007 . 
  it 's all funding , they get shit salaries while they can get higher ones in uk , germany , france , denmark . 
   also , next year i think we begin work on a fucking huge public hospital in bucuresti , while lowering taxes . 
  you do realise that romania does n't have ** any severe burn unit ** in any city besides bucharest ? 
  if you get a severe burn while living in cluj , timisoara , iasi , constanta you have to be flown in to bucharest . 
  taxes matter . 
  stop being ignorant and move a bit out of bucharest . 
   i would again probably suggest the us . 
  and how much do you pay ? 
  40k per year ? 
  in romania you pay as much as in germany as much as in france as much as in denmark . 
  how many nobel prizes do each produce ? 
  thanks . 
   57 billion is n't all that much to the french budget . 
  it 's almost ** twice ** our friggin ** military ** budget . 
  so those 4 nuclear submarines , those 300 nuclear heads , that nuclear aircraft carrier , salaries for ** 350000 ** people . 
  all that and some more goes out the window . 
  it 's 30 % of our education budget . 
  so that means ** 4 million ** pupils and students will get ** no ** education . 
  it means 300000 teachers ( and the equivalent pensioners ) will get no more money . 
   or are we just going to pretend that companies are n't attracted by lower tax ? 
  0 tax means no more military and then some or 1/3 of our education and research goes out the window . 
  i 'm sure that will be offset by the fact that mcdonalds will move its headquaters in france . 
  we 'll be a nation of photocopying clerks . 
  are you on crack ? 
  i tackle the first one then downvoted or hide the rest . 
  let 's play a game  . 
  so if you have a health problem , will you : * a ) stay in romania and pay bribes so that you do n't stay on a wait list for ages . 
  * b ) go home to britain to benefit from the nhs ? 
  if you have a severe burn issue , will you : * a ) pray to god that there are n't 6 people in romania that also have severe burn problems because romania has only ** one ** hospital with a severe burn unit with [ only ** 6 ** beds .

  * b ) scurry down to uk where you can benefit from the 4 nuclear subs and the 200 give or take nuclear heads that give you mad protection ? 
  nuclear subs which you will change soon enough . 
  how about the 2 aircraft carriers that you 'll be bringing and equipping with top of the line f-32 planes ? 
  if you have kids , will you choose to give them a higher education in : * a ) a country that does n't have one university that breaks in the shanghai top 500 universities ( i might be fuzzy about this , have n't checked in a while ) . 
  a country that is happy if they have 2 science nobel prizes in a century ( they actually have 1 iirc and he was working in the us ) . 
  * b ) a country that has 2 unis in top 10 of shanghai 's ranking . 
  that has 2 science nobel on average ** per year ** . 
  thank you very much for playing the * taxes matter * game , 
  '' < x european country  according to < y european country  '' articles are like cancer . 
  you think you cured it , but every 2 months they spring back to life to multiply like crazy and spread all over . 
  it 's just such a low effort post . 
  why do people do it ? 
   and your tax revenues would go down by 8 % , so not all that much . 
  tax on profits brought 57 [ ** b ** illion last year . 
  can you tell me in what world do you live where 57 billion is n't * that * much ? 
  if so , can i borrow a not at all large amount from you ? 
   and you would probably get a lot in return . 
  what ? 
  good intentions ? 
  the approval of companies ? 
  thumbs up from people who do n't understand how maths , budgeting and economics work ? 
   on a turnover of 22000m that 's an entirely reasonable 1.7 % profit google ? 
  oh god what a knee slapper  ) you have ** no idea ** how high added value companies work do you ? 
  wait ... are you ken m ? 
   than why you talked about it ? 
  you should understand the difference between paying your debts and eu budget . 
   it is n't charity you are naive if you if it is . 
  ok . tell me what you give to the eu . 
  why should we be in a single market with portugal and not simply in a free trade agreement ? 
  the us and mexico are in a free trade agreement but that does n't mean mexico gets money and mexicans do n't get the right to work in the us . 
  what benefits do we get ? 
  we need a european south park because this is gold !, 
   pointless debate . 
  it is a pointless debate . 
  you have countries that have run a super high deficit and debt , that were so deep in the hole they needed money from the imf , that are net beneficiaries from the eu budget and that have had banks that needed big bailouts . 
  and you compare them with france a country that has had smaller deficits and debt , no imf bailouts , no bank bailouts , that are net contributors to the eu budget ( the second largest btw ) . 
  and people complain that they do n't get equal treatment . 
  ** of course ** . 
  not to mention that without portugal , eu and eurozone would survive . 
  can you say the same without france ? 
   it 's not about portugal being given leeway or not so portugal did n't get leeway ? 
   it 's the visible double standards . 
  like i said several times , please vote for an anti-eu party and tell us how it goes when you 'll leave . 
  you think that those bailouts were to save portugal or greece ? 
  it was to save german and french banks what 's that have to do with the eu budget ? 
   it 's like it 's some charity when countries like france are the ones benefiting the most from eu . 
  it is a charity . 
  when was the last type you were a net contributor to the eu budget ? 
  it 's money so you become more developed . 
  why did portugal borrow from the imf ? 
  why did n't they go cold turkey , unilaterally leave the euro and default on its debt ? 
  and no leeway was ever given to portugal ? 
   it does n't matter if anyone has been punished or not . 
  how the hell does it not matter ? 
  how about the countries that are following the rules ? 
   the others had a 6 month disciplinary process in the commission . 
  it 's not the same . 
  they also had a much higher deficit than france  . 
  had to borrow money from the imf and were in critical condition . 
   the others had a 6 month disciplinary process in the commission if the system is so unfair to portugal and spain , why do n't they quit the eu ? 
   france , as of now , is not subject to any of these risks . 
  well the commission can start procedures any time . 
  so yeah we 're under that risk . 
  can you guarantee the commission wo n't start procedures ? 
   and given the recent news , it never really had to worry about them because it was always exempt .
