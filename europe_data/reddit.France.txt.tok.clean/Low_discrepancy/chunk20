  reddit ... nuff said . 
   this is why i am paternity testing all of my kids , without telling my future wife . 
  the child is born with rights and is under legal custody of ** both ** you and your wife . 
  too many `` no but '' replies . 
  then you sue the woman and ask for a friggin paternity test . 
  i love how confident you are in your bs . 
  genetic testing as a whole are very restricted in france . 
  and the law passed in 94 . 
  reliable genetic tests also became available in the 90s, 
  she did say that if you 're a citizen , then you 're part of france etc etc. 
  she 's quite for secularism . 
  it 's her niece marion that takes after her grandfather . 
  she 's crazy . 
  and the party is still full of nazis . 
  in this case that would be putting a white person as a cleaner . 
  is that the depressing part of lennon 's song ? 
  north . 
  well in this case fn is wrong and you have to live under a rock to think ump = ps, 
  only if the italian women come here and the portuguese ones go to spain . 
  what will i make my sangria from ? 
   military-grade automatic weapons smuggled into europe , they 're from bosnia though . 
   why bring up the fn ? 
  because that 's the speech fn has . 
  umps . 
  they 're the same thing , same party . 
  that 's bs . 
   they are destroying this country . 
  and they 've been at it for the last 35 years . 
  well i know this comment does n't come from the le pen family because they ca n't even speak english . 
  florian , is that you buddy ? 
  full of ruskies here . 
  also your article  moreover , fewer than half of street workers have pimps , and about half of the pimps are actually the employees of the women they manage , not the other way around . 
  well pimping is what i was friggin saying . 
  it is fully illegal to have pimps in france . 
   it specifically addresses the study you linked ... and many others too . 
  honest to god i 'm not seeing where they adress this article http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1986065 ctrl+f any of the authors does n't pick up anything . 
  the links do n't link to this article . 
  what paragraph is it, 
   it mentions examples well that did n't debunk the peer reviewed article did it ? 
   if you want more , write to your legislators and petition change . 
  well i am voting because that 's what i want . 
  but claiming it 's not morally wrong is plain ass stupid . 
  of course it is morally wrong . 
  morals have no connection with laws . 
   and if they were to move . . 
  so would i. 
  okay have fun in india because your dev job just moved buddy . 
  the engineers however , paired 10s-100s of times more than said factory positions remain in these developed economies . 
  yes and the engineers do n't live in a bubble , they live in a society and if everything around them goes to shit , well they wo n't live a happy life . 
   what 's interesting to me is how do you define `` the right level '' of taxation . 
  is the standard of living worse now than for our parents ? 
  yes ? 
  then the tax system is broken . 
  are doctors complaining that they do n't have enough meds and birth mortality is high . 
  yes ? 
  then the tax system is fucked . 
  roads do n't get fixed and buses do n't get changed in half a century ? 
  yes ? 
  then the tax system is not good enough . 
  students ca n't get a proper education because unis do n't get financing ? 
  yes ? 
  then the tax system is not good enough . 
  see buddy . 
  that 's how it works . 
  things have to improve and in many societies they are ** not ** improving . 
   no it 's not because that specific study is completely debunked . 
  then no the ps is not socially conservative . 
  did you miss the part where gay people can marry ? 
   no it 's not because that specific study is completely debunked . 
  where ? 
  yeah but the eu man . 
  you know ... 
  i mean it 's the man ... man , you get it right ? 
  it 's funny that the suits are from the eu and the workers are dutch . 
  how many massive companies have their hq in netherlands because of the nice tax environment ? 
   conservative well why do n't you define what conservative means . 
   if you have any evidence to the contrary , i would be glad to see it . 
  you claim something , you show me proof my friend . 
  that 's how it works . 
  burden of proof . 
   very low rate of coerced sex workers . 
  ** on average , countries where prostitution is legal experience larger reported human trafficking inflows . 
  ** well aint that a bummer . 
   russian extremists dude if we 'd spend our time quoting extremists from every country we 'd start thinking we live in a shit world . 
   here you go for a brief article on the subject . 
  the statistics validating what i said are everywhere . 
  the big majority of sex workers are not coerced . 
  even the most agenda pushing statistics support that claim . 
  show me ** french ** statistics . 
  it 's pointless to show me stuff from the us . 
  we 're on different friggin continents . 
  75 % of prostitutes in france are foreigners . 
  that 's like me saying the greek economy is doing just fine and showing you the stats from norway . 
   there 's virtually no difference between them . 
  yeah that 's full bullshit . 
  fn propaganda ... a party that has its accounts in panama while complaining about `` foreign finances '' . 
   but they are n't many , they are quite few . 
  sauce ? 
   and exploitation is everywhere . 
  well that settles it guys .
