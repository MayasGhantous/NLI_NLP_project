  well the commission can start procedures . 
  and considering the current climate , le pen might very likely win if the commission wants to act strong ( like you want them to do ) . 
  how do you think the eu will manage without france ? 
  instead , stop bitching . 
  you did n't get any fines and you get a cool net 3 billion from the eu budget . 
  but yeah ... muh risk . 
  pull the plug dude . 
  go vote for a party that will get you out of the eu . 
   potential fines , and potential freezing of structural funds , affect risk assessment for investors . 
  tons of potentials . 
  we 're under the same risk too  nothing says france wo n't potentially face the same problems . 
   eu-wide regulations are arbitrary not really . 
  no country has been sanctioned yet because they do not meet the deficit/debt goals . 
  so the regulations are pretty consistent . 
  no punishment !, 
   which is why it is unfeasible to ever punish any of the eu 's net contributors has ** anyone ** been punished ? 
   everything you wrote here has been answered by me before oh no . 
  you forgot to reply to one important aspect . 
  you 're bitching about how because of a bad publicity portugal can not attract investors . 
  how come the fact that you 're severely underfunding your r&d not affect your capability to attract investors . 
  or the fact that things your export require very little added value or r&d . 
   it appears to me you do n't even know what the `` excessive deficit procedure '' refers to . 
  muh bad . 
  yeah did you get any fines from that one ? 
  seems like the answer is a big fat no . 
   you 're answering as if because of this nothing else matters did you read the rest of the answer that shows that france produces higher added value products compared to portugal ? 
  how about the fact that france spends 2.24 % gdp on r&d compared to portugal 's [ 1.13 % ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/gb.xpd.rsdv.gd.zs ) . 
  i know it may come as a shocker to you , but the more you invest in r&d the more investors you get . 
   it has nothing to do with fault . 
  it 's about accounting and interpretation of the rules and purpose of the stability pact . 
  yes it has . 
  you do n't have to bail out a bank that is n't failing badly . 
   and , also , the point of regulation is that they do n't get a choice . 
  regulation is a a political process . 
   the fact that an institution does not comply with a regulation is not of itself a reason not to have a regulation . 
  i perfectly agree with that statement . 
  but it also shows that the largest uk banking institution will not be happy to follow the type of regulation you mention . 
  we 'll end in the classical situation where the regulators want to regulate , big business will be against it and those in power already go towards deregulation ( per the actions of the boe after brexit vote for example ) . 
   boe is limited by what it can do to the extent the uk remains in the single market . 
  ah yes . 
  i forgot it 's again the eu 's fault . 
   this does not change my position . 
  how come ? 
  you claim that boe wants higher capital standards for systemic banks . 
  barclays is a systemic bank and does n't even respect current tier 1 conditions . 
  what am i missing here ? 
   the vickers position essentially supports my view . 
  ah so you agree that boe is n't doing enough . 
  okay cool . 
  neither monte dei paschi nor allied irish banks are major banks that carry systemic risk . 
  barclays , deutsche , unicredit , hsbc , bnp , socgen are . 
  of course db is arguable because they sold some of their assets ( which probably pushed them in the black ) so i do n't know where they should stand . 
   ortugal , unlike france was indeed subject to an excessive deficit procedure . 
  you were so broke , you had to borrow money from the imf . 
  there was n't anything excessive , you just broke the bank and without the imf , you 'd be in a deeper deeper hole ( as in the govt not being able to pay salaries etc ) . 
   again this hurts portugal 's outlook and keeps investors away . 
  i 'd think it 's that 130 % debt level that keeps investors away . 
  or the fact that the france mostly exports high value products like [ airplanes and parts , cars , medecine ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/france_export_treemap.jpg ) while portugal is mostly [ shoes , radio parts , car parts , snowmobiles ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/portugal_export_treemap.png/450px-portugal_export_treemap.png ) i do not ask why the us is n't like france so it 's silly to ask why portugal is n't like france . 
   given it 's not clear banif should count ah , so the fact that you 've got shitty banks is the eu 's fault for some reason . 
  stop blaming the universe for everything that 's happening and take some responsability . 
   so the rules do n't apply to net contributors ? 
  what blackmail ? 
  stop inventing stuff . 
  you were so broke you had to get loans from the imf . 
  of course that had an impact . 
  stop wanting to compare france to portugal to show how unfair the world is to you . 
  you were in a deep deep hole . 
   so the rules do n't apply to net contributors ? 
  well the rules do n't apply to you , so why should they apply to us ? 
  also  following a troika 's delineated plan . 
  cuz you were so friggin broke you had to borrow from the imf . 
  the playing field is level . 
  no sanctions were given to anyone . 
   i did n't write harsher restrictions , i wrote higher capital standards that 's the same thing . 
   this is consistent with the position of the uk prior to the referendum in the lead up to the capital requirements directive and is also consistent with long-term views of the bank of england uhm ... no ... no it 's not . 
  boe cuts some [ capital requirements following brexit ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/05/bank-of-england-cuts-banks-capital-requirements-as-brexit-risks-crystallize.html ) here 's british economist joh vickers criticising boe for not [ fully implementing capital requirements ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/bank-of-england/12157696/john-vickers-says-banks-still-need-more-capital.html ) . 
   the regulatory needs of a country with a global financial centre are not likely to be exactly the same as those of a country without a global financial centre . 
  out of the major banks , only barclays is in the red in the last [ eu stress test ] ( https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/bf-al481_eustre_9u_20160729183606.jpg ) . 
  how about practing what you claim the boe is preaching ? 
   the overshoot was largely due to a financial sector support measure ( resolution of banif ) who 's fault is it that you have shitty banks ? 
   not even getting into the fact that portugal was under troika 's supervision the whole time , and following a troika 's delineated plan . 
  take a look at your debt levels . 
  they 're 30 % higher than france 's . 
  of course a plan needs to be put in practice . 
   there 's reason to suspect france 's numbers actually being higher than 3.5 % . 
  what reason ? 
   the uk needs to be able to require banks in the uk to comply with higher capital standards than is currently required by eu law . 
  so uk wants to leave the eu to imposer ** harsher ** restrictions on banks ? 
  well i 've heard it all . 
  it is at the very least wrongful since it goes against regulations . 
  the fact that it is a secret deal certainly makes it deceptive . 
  i fail to see the secretness of it . 
  your country 's been running higher deficits than france , much higher debt/gdp , you 're a net beneficiary to the eu budget ( unlike france ) and you still have received about 0 sanctions . 
  tell us , what secret deal has portugal passed with the eu ? 
  so you agree that your `` france thinks it owns the eu '' is a stupid-ass comment . 
   not yet , but nearly just recently . 
  let 's look at the deficits : * spain [ 5.1 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/spain_en.htm ) * portugal [ 4.4 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/portugal_en.htm ) * greece [ 7.2 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/greece_en.htm ) * france [ 3.5 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/france_en.htm ) you do understand that 3.5 < 4.4 < 5.1 < 7.2 right ? 
  it 's basic arithmetics . 
   were `` blackmailed '' into doing at least part of what the commission arbitrarily decided to demand not to get sanctions . 
  those countries are in vastly poorer economic shape than france .
