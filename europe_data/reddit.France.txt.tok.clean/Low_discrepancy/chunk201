  you were running deficits of 11 % . 
  you have a debt/gdp ratio of 129 % . 
  and unlike you ( and those countries ) , france is a [ net contributor to the eu budget ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/europe/09/eu_budget_spending/img/graph_net_contrib_466x485.gif ) . 
  we can contribute 0 next time . 
  i 'm sure that 'll help reduce our deficit . 
   criminal deception so where 's the criminal aspect in this ? 
  also where 's the deception ? 
  so the forecasts were wrong . 
  big surprise . 
   think they own the eu that 's not a thing . 
  that 's your imagination . 
  / u/lupatine was talking about deficits which spain , and portugal do . 
  greece has n't had a budget deficit under 3 % in [ ever ? 
  ] ( https://chewychunks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/why-euro-caused-greece-to-be-fiscally-responsible.png ) . 
   they have quite some explaining to do to portugal , italy , ireland , spain , greece and possibly more . 
  have any of those countries been sanctioned because they 're running 3 % + budget deficits ? 
  last time portugal had a [ 3 % deficit was in 2007 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/og.png?url=/portugal/government-budget ) . 
  it was 4.3 in 2006 . 
  last time france had a deficit under 3 was also in 2007 but it was 2.4 and in 2006 it was also under 3 . 
   so that amounts to fraud . 
  i 'm not sure you know what the term fraud means ... 
   i do n't think you understood the joke . 
  what 's the joke then in his refugee video ? 
   let 's not blame the children for the sins of their parents , okay ? 
  no one is blaiming no one . 
  but it 's important to understand the context . 
  are bananas cheap in turkey now . 
  no way man . 
  i thought it was super funny because that 's exactly how i see , in a stereotypical sense , the germans . 
  `` proud of not being proud '' man they do that to extremes . 
  i meant it like a caricature :p . colbert was a caricature of the right . 
  this guy would he be a caricature of the left ? 
  i meant colbert 's character not colbert himself . 
  colbert 's character was full on republican . 
  so is this guy what we 'd see if colbert 's character were a leftists ? 
  in the sense that it gives a power to someone who can dictate what kind of society the french want to live in ... 
  the french have decided in what society they wan na live . 
  no one can refuse us that right . 
  if you want to refuse us that right , you better raise an army . 
   i think it 's the same with the ban of the burka . 
  quite a few muslim women left france because they could n't live without the burka . 
  seems like we solved that problem . 
  we live in the society we wan na live . 
  and they live in the society they wan na live . 
   it might sound like damage control at first , and it 's done rightly so , but the problems which arise could become even bigger with this you 're banning nazi groups . 
  does it seem like you have bigger problems than in 33 ? 
  having to act in secrecy means it 's more difficult for them to spead their message . 
  also they broke the law . 
  then again , you have access to any tax files ... so it 's fair to say different countries . 
   you clearly were n't here so have to rely on polls alone . 
  argument of authority . 
   if you think the british media was focused on what the french pm was saying that outlines your misunderstanding . 
  ignorance is not an excuse . 
   the iraq war situation led to the largest political protest in british history , that means jack shit . 
  or well it means one side was very motivated to go in the streets . 
  i do not look at the streets to tell me how the population feels . 
  if so i 'd conclude that [ anti gay marriage ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_manif_pour_tous#/media/file:manif_pour_tous_13012013_021.jpg ) is super high in france ( with 1 million marchers ) while actually [ 68 % of french are for it ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/societe/mariage/mariage-et-homoparentalite/mariage-gay-et-adoption-les-francais-majoritairement-pour-progression-chez-les-sympathisants-ump_745617.html ) . 
   a slim majority 54 % for - 38 % against is not a slim majority . 
  the feeling was there . 
  uk govt and its people wanted to invade . 
  you invaded . 
  stop rewriting history . 
   representative in the sense that decisions are made by representatives of the people . 
  those are not representatives of 51 % of the people . 
  they 're representatives of 36 % and as such they should only get 36 % of the seats give or take a couple . 
   is definitely wrong so is brexit cuz muh immigrants . 
   wmd of course , un presentations , you mean presentations like [ de villepin 's speech ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/french_address_on_iraq_at_the_un_security_council ) , french pm at the time . 
  here 's the phrase you can take from it  given this context , the use of force is not justified at this time . 
  also other nuggets  mr. president , to those who are wondering in anguish when and how we are going to cede to war , i would like to tell them that nothing , at any time , in this security council , will be done in haste , misunderstanding , suspicion or fear . 
   that 54 % was engineered . 
  just like everything is engineered . 
  but you could have looked at what the continent was saying with respect to that war : france and germany were opposed to the invasion . 
  just because something is democratic , does n't make it right . 
   so when you ( and other people i assume ) refer to ` single market ' it 's not my definition though if you so choose to believe that i had an active part in creating the eu , i wo n't mind  http://www.europeanpolicy.org/en/european-policies/single-market.html the single market is based on 4 pillars . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/3328547a-7e3d-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198 one of her highest goals is reduction of immigration . 
  this will automatically remove uk from the single market . 
   t without giving people the automatic right to permanently settle in another member state , but it would be complicated . 
  people do not have the automatic right to settle in another member country ( see the 15k roma france deports yearly ) . 
  they simply have the right to not have to pass through barriers when looking for a employment . 
  if you remove this , you stop being a single market . 
  even adam smith knew that you got ta remove work barriers . 
  it 's not a bug of the single market but a feature . 
  would that put a damp on may 's dreams of a hard brexit ? 
   exchange rate changes have other consequence though and change economic activity and impact trade balance deficits . 
  yeah . 
  give us a call when you 'll be a net exporter . 
  til then you 're poorer . 
  but nice semantics , 
   but why does it have to be so intertwined with the buying and selling of physical goods ? 
  of course a trade deal might be hatched . 
  we made one with canada just now . 
  so if all 27 * european parliaments will agree with a new fta with uk then we 'll have free trade for physical goods . 
  * ( plus some regional ones , let 's hope uk does n't burn anymore bridges for its sake ) but op was talking about how no brexiter wantes out of the single market which is in direct ** contradiction ** with the \\ # 2 reason why uk voted out . 
  wait ? 
  is n't the pound lower ? 
  and you as an economy with a trade balance deficit have to pay ** more ** for the same goods ? 
  the future is today . 
  you 're poorer today . 
  as someone with an australian flair i ` all assume you 're a native english speaker . 
  as a native english speaker , do you comprehend the difference between ** single market ** and ** free trade ** ?
