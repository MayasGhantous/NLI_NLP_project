  tell us what part confuses you , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_market http://internationalecon.com/trade/tch110/t110-2.php  a common market establishes free trade in goods and services , sets common external tariffs among members and also allows for the free mobility of capital and labor across countries . 
  rtfm uk . 
  rtfm !, 
   is it worth continuing here ? 
  no there is n't . 
  uk is doing an amazing job at knocking itself down . 
  a lowly redditor like myself can only be in awe at britain 's capability to fuck itself up . 
   no doubt that our current constitutional government is run via representative democracy . 
  only 36 % of english voted for the torries but they received 51 % of the seats . 
  no you 're not a * representative * democracy when 1/3rd of the people can claim they are the majority . 
   they ignored the will of the people over iraq https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/03/remembering-iraq/ no they did n't . 
  54 % of british said in 2003 that the war in iraq was justified . 
  it 's just that they discovered how poor of an idea it was and they tweaked with their memories to make them think they were against the war all along . 
   i do n't think any brexiter actually wants to leave the single market . 
  the second reason why they voted out was because they want to [ control immigration ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ ) . 
  you can not be in a single market and control immigration . 
  would you consider netherlands a single market if amsterdam can say no work or housing for people outside of amsterdam unless we say so ? 
   it 's the eu that 's going to say fuck you , you do n't want the bad , you do n't get the good . 
  no , the eu says -  `` go read the the definition of what a single market is '' . 
  no politician should go against the will of the people . 
  you might end up with situations like when mitterrand banned capital punishment [ even though the majority of french were for it ] ( http://www1.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/022/article_11865.asp ) . 
  the people are never wrong !, 
  the pound says so , 
  what better way to control migration than becoming a place where people do n't really wan na go to . 
  hey i never said i was against brexit :p . i just find it fascinating how the british do this mental gymnastics in trying to show that brexit is good or something . 
   not everyone can get what they want . 
  everyone [ will be poorer ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_429ihjqvpbv1cnb ) though . 
  awesome choice there . 
  by your logic you 'd openly accept 800k 50 + yo polish people that are ** less ** educated than your population but ** more ** educated than the 50 yo british . 
  dude stop grasping at straws , it 's ridiculous . 
  when talking about education , age , gender , hair colour , baldness , that shit does ** not ** matter . 
  their country ** paid ** for their education and you get them for free . 
  but hey , you played yourself . 
  you 'll be poorer , that 's a fact . 
  so at least be graceful and stop rapid logic , mkay buddy ? 
   well no , it depends on their field yeah i 'm sure you got 800k poles with masters in basket weaving . 
   the other guy pointed out that you 're comparing a generally young and mobile group to an entire population base who gives a shit ? 
  by your logic you 'd openly accept 800k 50 + yo polish people that are ** less ** educated than your population but ** more ** educated than the 50 yo british . 
  who gives a shit what their ages are when discussing education ? 
  it 's as irrelevant as sex , hair colour or friggin clothing style . 
  it 's pathetic . 
   also let 's not pretend that polish people/culture are as similar to brits as americans are . 
  if americans will elect trump then yes we 'll see that the british and the americans are close culturally . 
  willing to self destroy just because muh immigrants ... yup !, 
   but what 's the point in taking into account the proportion of people too old to work with a degree ? 
  because they are part of ** your ** society . 
  do old people stop needing services that require degrees ? 
  do they stop needing doctors , nurses , pharmacists , electricians , banking accounts ? 
  they 're still full members of your society and they benefit from the ** money educated people pay in taxes ** . 
  what 's so magical about older people ? 
  what if british green eyed people all have phds ? 
  does that mean you have to turn down any foreigner that has masters or less because hey british green eyed people are more educated than that ? 
  what 's the deal ? 
  please tell me cuz i do n't get it . 
  why are you eliminating old people from your population ? 
  you go from x % with education to y % with education . 
  where x < y. i 'm not being obtuse , you people are adding a comment that is pointless . 
  you increase the percentage of educated people in your country ... hurr durr but what about our old people ? 
  they still be dumb !, 
  you get ** young ** people with a long career in front of them that are * already * a net benefit ... hurr durr in 50 years they 'll need healthcare . 
  i start to understand why uk voted to be poorer . 
  you guys do n't logic . 
  or you try to find this extremely convoluted reason why the way you voted was just . 
  it was n't . 
  from an economics pov it does n't make a lick of sense . 
   but it 's not helpful to compare young people to the country as a whole , because a very low proportion of pensioners has degrees . 
  again , uk goes from having x % of population with a degree , to y % of the population with a degree . 
  where x < y. 
  that 's the very definition of ** better ** ( * without * having to off your pensioners ) . 
  this has got to be the most stupid argument i 've heard yet . 
   the kind of logic that would n't compare age skewed groups ah classic brexiter . 
  stunning logic . 
  you get people that are ** more educated ** than the people living in your country . 
  who cares about their age or that they 're young . 
  the fact that they 're young is a massive benefit because they have a long career before them . 
   built up liabilities before declaring the cost or benefit of something * facepalm * they 're playing by ** your ** rules . 
  they 're paying at ** your ** tax levels determined by ** your ** politicians and economists to be feasible . 
  if you think they 'll cost money on the long run , increase taxes ... till they stop coming . 
  but now they 're playing by ** your ** rules . 
  brexiters are the type of people willing to burn money because you see in 50 years they might get cancer from the ink on the money . 
  you 're an illogical breed and by the accounts of the vast majority of economists you 'll be poorer in the short and medium term . 
  you played yourself . 
  i 'll stop commenting here because i dislike talking to people who are illogical . 
   no it 's in work tax credits . 
   it compared the eu citizen group , which was skewed towards youth , to the whole of the uk population rather than a group with the same average age . 
  holy fuck . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  who gives a shit about the 60 yo polish dude that staid in poland ? 
   on the economic side it completely ignored the fact that the eu citizens were building up pension liabilities with the uk government if i pay taxes in a system i for fucking sure expect to receive a pension . 
  what kind of mickey mouse logic do you people have ? 
  oh you contributed to the pension system ? 
  fuck you you 're not a brit . 
   40 % of them are on benefits when they arrive for christ sake . 
  have no idea what that means . 
  it can very well mean students getting scholarships or help . 
  so your beef is n't the number of immigrants but their education . 
  eu immigrants are actually more educated than the british population and are a net benefit to the british economy . 
  you just played yourself uk , 
  so 800k poles is too many , 800k americans is ok ?
