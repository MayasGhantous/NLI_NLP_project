  americans like the americans you have now . 
   in 2014 , they underperformed ( european elections but then again , that vote is so different from the rest ) . 
  weird . 
  those are the elections where fringe parties usually do best . 
  your impressions of immigrants being too many . 
  is this like the pirate party that tops the icelandic polls and ends up 3rd or trump in a week ? 
   it would require a strong sacrifice at first . 
  do it !, 
  * * mostly cuz i wan na spend a few months in italy while paying even less than i 'd normally have to . 
   reject illegal immigrants from middle east and africa . 
  so poland is ok for syrian ** refugees ** ? 
  why did n't you say so man ? 
  what if instead of 800k you had 800k americans ? 
  would that have changed something ? 
   highest point in denmark is 170m til . 
  that 's crazy flat . 
  i bike that elevation in 1.5 km from sea level at the med in nice to work . 
   why waste money acquiring property legally beforehand ? 
  because they just need to buy 50 % +1 of homes and they will have complete majority . 
  it 's genius . 
  ( except in cases where they needed 2/3rd majority ), 
  https://www.google.fr/amp/www.dailyedge.ie/irish-accent-abroad-1891786-jan2015/%3famp%3d1 here 's a guy saying that irish accents can sometimes be tough to be understood . 
  that does n't make the irish speakers poor speakers of english or anything . 
  we 're not talking about understanding fairly well . 
  because that can happen always . 
  we 're talking about the local particularities . 
  and local particularities can be very weird and they 're not the point of a clear communication which should be of the utmost important in a business setting . 
   but only some of us are able to speak it well , and those who do should simplify for those who do n't . 
  if you take a texan , a scottish and an australian and let them speak just like they 'd do it with their mom dad , full of slang , abbreviations , inner jokes , thick accents etc , i can bet you that you 'll have misunderstandings quite quickly . 
  who does n't speak english well enough from this bunch ? 
  yes we all speak french but i do n't speak ** their ** french nor do they speak ** my ** french . 
  and quebecan can have a super thick accent ( here [ fred pelleting ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fqq49yqptzg ) nor will i start speaking with a ton of verlan . 
  do you take your thickest irish accent and slang and expect to be 100 % well understood in bumfuck texas ? 
  tl ; dr : read the article . 
  you can be the most fluent english speaker and still be ignorant of the fact that for the british `` that 's interesting '' means it 's crap . 
  many english native speakers assume that since we speak english , we 're speaking their local flavour of english when that is n't the case . 
  this article puts things on track saying that your little special brand of english that you speak in your little quaint village or even tiny country is not international english . 
   because language teaching ca n't be expected to go beyond rote learning at any point . 
  instead of snark whynott bother reading the article . 
  they 're saying that native anglophones immediately assume that everyone is knowing or willing to know all the little variations from the norm . 
  the vast majority of people learn english are n't really interested in slang , in obscure pointless abbreviations and the majority of people will skip on nuances ( i.e. 
  this is interesting ) . 
  i am sorry but i do n't care about the cultural differences between a n australian saying this is interesting , an american saying or a british . 
  tl ; dr : we are all speaking english but we are not speaking ** your ** english . 
  i also noticed that baguettes or pains au chocolat are also rarely of the same quality as in france :p, 
   the biggest joke is ristorante pizza . 
  you could have stopped there . 
  frozen pizzas : s, 
   that means your behavior has to be absolutely spotless . 
  that 's why i also support a ban on all athletes that push for political messages like [ support of the gay community . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_protests_surrounding_the_2014_winter_olympics ) / s, 
   it is an investment we is making so that ee can become bigger customers of we 's products really ? 
  like poland and airbus ? 
  why not invest in south america ? 
  what 's special about poland ? 
  ee is formed by ** independent ** countries that can very easily refuse we products . 
   conspiratard crap are you having conversations with yourself ? 
   , the evil companies and multinationals , we should just keep being poor forever yeah companies are in the business of making you rich :d lol . 
  you must be very wrong . 
   you are the one who claimed that spanish shale would be viable , not me you several hours ago  it would have so many positive effects , from cheaper energy prices and when presented with the cases of poland and romania you bury your head in the sand . 
  show us proof spain will beneficial . 
  back your claims then buddy . 
  also get in a futures contract if you want to fix oil prices for 2019, 
   i said the burden of proof relies on you who made the affirmation that spanish shale would n't be viable , let me explain to you how burden of proof works . 
  ** you ** are the one wanting ** to spend money ** . 
  i 'm the guy saying that we 're fine as is . 
  so i am ** not spending ** any money . 
  if you wan na spend money , you got ta show why . 
  that 's why you got ta provide the data . 
  he who wants to change the status quo has to provide reason . 
   bkn is still asking for licences in spain should give you a hint . . what hint ? 
  that means jack shit . 
  of course oil companies will ask for that . 
  when they start raising money from banks and investors they can bs about how they have massive reserves off the coast of spain . 
  believe it or not companies bs a fuckton in order to get good publicity , in order to get contracts ( how many budgets have increased between the validation of the project and the end ? ), 
  but we 're the gullible ones that need to get out heads out of the sand while you are 100 % behind the trustwothy oil companies . 
   doing ad hominems , you ca n't expect better from trolls . 
  irony much ? 
  :d  you are the one who claimed that spanish shale would be viable wait you think i said that spanish shale would be viable because i 'm saying the contrary citing examples such as poland and romania . 
   if the costs of fracking in spain are smaller than the expected income why would it . 
  gib sauces . 
  there 's no reason to believe it will be . 
   do you have any numbers on the cost of a barrel of oil in 2019 ? 
  http://knoema.fr/infographics/yxptpab/crude-oil-price-forecast-long-term-2016-to-2025-data-and-charts 60-65, 
  not during the first 5 seconds . 
   recently another report stated those 65-69 , recently retired , were on average richer than 60 % of the population . 
  that would just show that the distribution is extremely skewed . 
  your average that is 60 % richer than the population does not contradict the fact that 20 % of 65 + yo are under the 60 % threshold which is higher than countries like germany or france . 
   there are a lot who are affluent , and getting more affluent . 
  yes and inequality breeds discontent like the last ref showed . 
  did you watch the video and see the impact inequality had on the brexit vote ? . 
  you provide 0 sources about how spanish shale would be economically viable , 0 numbers on the final cost of a barrel of oil and ignore other european countries that have vastly more reserves and could have benefitted from economy of scales . 
  yeah ... 
  i 'm the troll , the sheeple , part of europeans that should get  their head out of the sand you 're the wise one , that sees beyond the bs . 
  holy shit you have a high impression of yourself do n't you think ? 
  i get it . 
  you live with the hope tha fracking will be super cheap in spain . 
  do tell us how that works out , 
   gas reserves are continually being discovered around the globe , spain is no exception.in baleares , valencia and the canary islands there have been petitions from companies to make prospections but the regional governments did n't allow it , so we do n't know the viability of exploitations in those regions .
