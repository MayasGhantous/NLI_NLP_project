  so countries with massively more reserves are ** not profitable ** but you think spain has a magic stash hidden 5m below the surface . 
  if you had had easily exploited reserves , trust me chevron and other big companies would have made vulture swirls around your country . 
   nobody said that spanish shale gas would be more expensive than the massive amounts we pay to algeria . 
  oil and gas are ** super ** cheap now . 
  last year quite a few us shale companies filed for bankruptcy because opec was driving them out of business . 
  unemployment in norway was increasing because of that . 
  and you come here claiming you can produce cheaper than the us . 
  and with fires breaking out every summer in the baleares and canary islands and temps regularly hitting 45 , drill baby drill , burn baby burn seems like an awesome idea . 
  global warming wo n't affect you much will it , 
   `` negresa '' - literally `` black woman '' yeah . 
  you do n't call it a dirty black woman . 
  [ he says at 2:58 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqlfcmpo3uk#t=181 ) and afluent generation of elders voters voted out ... 
  but why would anyone believe that . 
  the elders in uk are not afluent . 
  [ this chart ] ( http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/local/cache-vignettes/l530xh494/graph4-6e28f.jpg ) shows that poverty levels are quite high for elderly people . 
  even being ** twice ** as high compared to the french for 65 + yo . 
  and they talk about inequality increasing greatly since joining the eu , but they do n't mention anything about the great deregulation by the iron lady . 
   european solidarity lies on the bottom of the baltic with nord stream . 
  really ? 
  is that where poland is putting all those eu funds ? 
   last i checked france gets 70 % of its energy from npps and somehow it 's still not a nuclear crater . 
  while i 'm a huge fan of nuclear ... the reality is that france is not doint great at the moment in terms of nuclear . 
  areva went bankrupt and if the epr does not start very very soon , it might end up being a huge hole for france . 
  flamanville is late , the finnish powerplant is over budget and fucking dumb fucks at edf started fucking hinkley point ( the [ cfo of edf quit over that ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-edf-britain-nuclear-idukkcn0w80zi ) ) . 
  there are problems and we might simply not have the know how to make the epr if hinkley point fails , it will result in the bankruptcy of edf , that 's a fact and costs of several 10s of billions of euros . 
  it 's a huge gamble that i do n't particularly care for . 
   , in spain for example you [ have minimal resources ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g0ufh_j6lkq/u7woqboyjmi/aaaaaaaaac0/5frdfri6ju8/s1600/piccit_europes_shale_gas_reserves_5_27226865.png ) here 's [ the estimated reserve values ] ( https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/ ) . 
  spain 8.4 tcf . 
  poland 145.8 tcf . 
  romania 50.6 tcf . 
  poland has ** 18 ** times and romania ** 6 ** times the reserves spain has . 
  and chevron still packed up and went to other areas of the globe . 
   but i guess we should just keep importing 100 % of our gas and oil no ? 
  welcome to econ 101 . 
  if seller a wants 10 euros for product 1 and seller b wants just 5 euros for product 1 , then spain as a buyer will buy product 1 from b and not a. 
  because 5 < 10 . 
  you can not ( de ) regulate mathematics . 
   those problems in poland and romania are political and not because of the soil . 
  no they were not political . 
  unless if by political you mean that it would be too expensive for chevron to extract from that region compared to other regions where it exploits shale oil . 
  poland and romania were * very * friendly to shale oil . 
   also the `` stinking gypsy '' was not meant as a racial insult because , you know , the reporter he was referring to is not a gypsy . 
  am i actually having this conversation ? 
  when being told that racism is deeply engrained in romanian society , your answer is hey he did n't direct that racial slur to a gypsy , so that 's fiiine . 
  that 's ** the fucking definition ** of deeply engrained racism . 
  the fact that gypsy is automatically a swear word . 
  the fact that you call someone a dirty gypsy , regardless of their ethnic origins . 
   clearly , we should reform the romanian language for you to feel comfortable . 
  another example of deeply engrained racism . 
  the normalisation of racist behaviour . 
  it becomes a habit . 
  using slurs becomes part of the `` culture '' . 
  thanks buddy . 
  could n't prove it better myself . 
   making tax evasion harder is one of the key reasons why this practice is in use . 
  transparency trumps privacy in this case , in my personal opinion . 
  can i also read your emails . 
  in my opinion adultery trumps privacy . 
  what if you sleep with someone that has an std and give it to your spouse ? 
  and ? 
  are you against discrimination based on nationality ? 
  if not , then we 'll send a few calais people up your way , 
   most of the migrants that came to europe in 2015 , and continue flooding in are not refugees , they are economic migrants . 
  and ? 
  the discussion is about redistributing * refugees * not people entering europe . 
   i wish people in europe got their head out of the sand about fracking what you and / u/nounhud are completely ignoring is that the us and europe are ** different ** continents . 
  i know . 
  amazing . 
  you already had countries that were massively in favour of fracking like poland , romania . 
  you had big companies that are experts in their field studying the matter . 
  poland was estimated to have the * largest shale gas resources in europe * . 
  what happened ? 
  [ chevron pulled out ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/chevron-poland-shale-idusl6n0va08820150131 ) . 
   exxon mobil , total and marathon oil have also stopped shale gas exploration in poland over the past three years . 
  & nbsp ;  but since they launched exploration , the estimates have been downgraded , geological conditions for drilling have proved difficult , and industry executives complain of uncertainty about government regulation . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/09/polish-shale-industry-collapsing-as-number-of-licenses-nearly-halves  `` expectations about the polish shale project were mainly based on north america 's experiences , '' said marcin zieba , the director of the polish exploration and production industry organisation . 
  `` unfortunately , our local reality turned out to be completely different . '' even their national gas firm cut down . 
  same story in romania where the pm at the time was massively in favour and said they 'll start exploitation . 
  [ chevron left ] ( http://energypost.eu/shale-gas-eastern-europe-implications-chevrons-exit-romania/ ) . 
  stop wanting to make shell gas in europe happen , it just wont . 
  the soil structure is different . 
  and in terms of population density the situation is * vastly * different . 
  consider north dakota , it has about the same area as romania ( give or take 15 % ) but ** 25 times ** fewer people . 
  so in terms of infrastructure , possibilities of exploitation , and likelihood of mini-earthquakes is not awesome . 
   is romania safer than france ? 
  apparently it is .

   sure . 
  what about dealing with le pen and her anti romanian hate speech . 
  wait le pen made * vile * comments towards romanians . 
  show us . 
   oh , you mean to tell me that no country can 100 % control what their citizens can say or do ? 
  was he or not your president ? 
  is that type of speech not prevalent in your country ? 
  dude you 're so deep in denial , you could be an iraki general . 
   i would bet le pen still wins . 
  okay show me where le pen called people stinky gypsies   how about the nazi collaborators ? 
  you do ** not ** wan na compare those notes buddy , you 'll end up very poorly . 
   of course not , but still , it was the `` french '' that surrendered and then collaborated .
