  the circlejerk has started . 
  i 'm off . 
  cheers , 
  so you 're referring to poor people ? 
  why did you choose to call them `` certain group '' and not poor people ? 
   except the crime rates were even lower before romania joined the eu so no intentional homicide rates are at 1.2 in france , 1.5 in romania . 
  claiming romania is so much safer than the west is ridiculous . 
  my point is that once they operate outside romania you ca n't blame the romanian law enforcement for not catching them . 
  where is their home base ? 
  where are the boses located ? 
  you tell us !, 
   by all means , arrest them , deport them to romania that 's what we 're doing to the tune of 15k per year . 
  and that 's why romania should n't be in schengen . 
  because expulsions would be much more difficult to perform . 
   so you are basically arguing for ethnic discrimination . 
  anyone living beyond their means should be investigated . 
   except that many illegal activities have already been laundered in western europe so you think that the gypsy gangs have companies in western europe that launder money for them ? 
  care to give one or two examples or are you talking outta your ass ? 
   they are not one people and what worked in france over decades will not work in romania only 25 years after communism fell , if at all . 
  did gypsies appear in romania after communism fell ? 
  because if i look at history , they 've been there for 400 years . 
  many integrated but many are left out . 
   hence my sympathy for them . 
  ah yes ,  certain group which unfortunately tends to be weak to these sorts of thing so much sympathy man . 
  be careful or you 'll end up labeled as a bleeding heart . 
   the romanians are to blame for the plight of the gypsies who said that ? 
  putting words in other people 's mouth wo n't advance the discussion . 
   all the eu norms are followed . 
  all minority protection directives are enforced . 
  that 's like saying that discrimination in the western world does n't exist because all the rules are followed . 
  or like saying sexual abuse can not be further combatted because we passed all the laws , what more do you want from us ? 
   an official apology from the romanian government for the centuries of gypsy enslavement ? 
  a memorial to the victims of discrimination ? 
  how about romanians and their givt actually deal with the pervasive hateful speech that would see any politician getting constantly mocked or removed from the spotlights ? 
  in romania what ever happened to your president when he was talking about that stincky gypsy reporter . 
  every time there 's a comment about romanian criminality , the discussion always becomes `` hey it 's not us , the * real * romanians , it 's the gypsies . 
  it 's their fault '' without ever bothering to deal with the issues of hate speech ? 
  how about tackling that ? 
  is there any effort to tone done such speech ? 
  or is the debate always : `` welp we 're a poor country , nothing we can do about it . 
  these are topics for the rich west , everybody 's poor here '' . 
   even in france they 're 23 % unemployed i see that you modified your answer . 
  23 unemployment while the french average is 10 . 
  that 's just double the rate and in line with for example youth unemployment . 
  not 5 friggin times the rate , man like romania sees . 
  france has ** the lowest unemployment ** levels for roma in europe . 
  when will you admit there 's a huge discrimination problem ? 
   i wrote none of these arguments you offer no arguments . 
  you have 0 understanding of societal situations . 
  do you deny that gypsies are suffering from discrimination in romania and bulgaria ? 
  should western europe tell romania and bulgaria that they 'll give no more eu funds because you got ta make it on your own ? 
   so you are implying that one of the countries with the lowest crime rates in eu easy to have low criminality when 11k of your own citizens are serving time abroad . 
  france had to expulse 15k gypsies just last year back to romania because they had no business being here . 
  and if you 've been to paris or any major french city you 'll see that quite a few are involved in pickpocketing , panhandling , prostitution , human trafficking , etc. 
   crime networks which by definition are multinational both in composition organised crime is almost * never * multinational . 
  a romanian gypsy would not join an albanian network would not join the italian mafia . 
  they have a pyramidal type organisation . 
  bringing in foreigners and people you do n't know for a lifetime only serves to weaken the organisation and make it easily exposed to the police . 
   what about marriage contracts which result in large sums being exchanged ? 
  where do those large sums of money come from ? 
  how many investigations have the romanian fiscal police launched in these activities ? 
   you really need to have more respect for these people 's cultural uniqueness man . 
  and the romanian gypsy tradition is what ? 
  get discriminated against then leaving the country ? 
  well i can not possibly defeat such impeccable logic and argumentation as strong as : `` discrimination does n't exist '' and `` suck it up '' . 
  truly you are a master of debate and a fine connaisseur of how society works . 
   it is the responsibility of communities to integrate , educate themselves and adpot the culture needed to survive in any given state . 
  trump called , he wants you on his team !, 
  just continue saying racism does n't exist and that romania and bulgaria are doing an awesome job at creating the same conditions for everybody . 
  #racism is a myth !, 
   the fuck did n't you fuckers do a better job at integrating them then ? 
  how many french gypsies go to uk or germany and steal from them ? 
  we have 500k gypsies and the number is about 0 . 
   and do n't turn them into suicide bombers , please . 
  another 66er from romania . 
  charming . 
   certain group which unfortunately tends to be weak to these sorts of things well i see your integration goes very smoothly  . 
  weird you do n't mention that that particular group has an unemployment rate of 35-40 % , while the country wide unemployment rate is at 6-7 % . 
  not to mention that the vast majority of roma live in rural regions in abject conditions . 
  also romania has done quite a poor job fighting organised crime networks . 
  how the hell do you manage to build shitty palaces without the fiscal police checking your activities . 
  hey you can say that gypsies are difficult and yeah they have a lifestyle that is very different . 
  even we have certain problems with , but heck french gypsies do n't go to spain , italy , us , canada , germany and bother people there , do they ? 
  italy 's been in a union for 150 years . 
  at some point someone should have said : hey maybe let 's make all of this more even ? 
  we 're all italians afterall . 
  right ? 
   as the uk is forecast to become the largest economy in europe within a few decades time . 
  specific economic predictions are normally quite fickle but these predictions take into account demographic shifts , like the fall in german population and trends such as french economic stagnation . 
  and the fact that uk left the largest single market in the world which will push polish people to go in more massive amounts to germany which will stop the decline of the population for a long time does n't matter ? 
  long term statistics are of very little importance when such a massive shock occured . 
  let 's recall that in 2000 germany was called [ the sick man of europe ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/209559 ) . 
  in 2003 they went through a small recession . 
   no one approved it , no one voted for it yeah you did when you entered the common market . 
   both staying in the eu and leaving the eu means an uncertain , unpredictable future . 
  wtf ? 
  everything is unpredictable but putting on the same level remaining ** and ** leaving is nonsense . 
  meanwhile we know that brexit will make the british poorer . 
  almost every economist agrees on that . 
  i also fail to understand how secondary screenings will help .
