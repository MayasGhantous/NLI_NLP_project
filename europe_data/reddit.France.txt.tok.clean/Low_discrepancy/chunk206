  you can not turn down people because they 're brown . 
  you 'll only be able to reject people who you already deported . 
   , i doubt canada would attract them more than what they could already have in europe [ they can attract enough ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada\u2013czech_republic_relations#visa_dispute ), 
   unlikely it will be abused , as secondary screenings , yeah . 
  it 's not like it happened before https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada\u2013czech_republic_relations#visa_dispute, 
   it 's expensive to relocate your whole family to canada and you visas do n't let you stay forever https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada\u2013czech_republic_relations#visa_dispute we should start a pool . 
  i 'm betting in 5 years problems will appear . 
  if they had them with the czech , romania and it 's 2 million gypsies will be worse . 
   point is , we are proud of our diversity . 
  you just simply destroyed it . 
  there are good sides and bad sides . 
  diversity is nice culturally but economically you are completely messed up look at the train crash you had a few months ago . 
  https://www.google.fr/amp/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/36792246 they were using friggin phones to control the train traffic . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  how many people are willing to move south to invest there ? 
  how much is your state investing in that area ? 
  how many people are being sent there . 
  meanwhile in france : you come do you education in paris , you might stay , but you might also leave . 
  there are national research centers that are scattered across the country.the rail company invests in every region with a high population . 
  people can come from wherever and go wherever . 
  sure there are certain areas more isolated but that 's because they 're mostly rural . 
  diversity is nice but there 's a price to pay and as a frenchman , i would n't be particularly happy to pay it . 
  the polish did suffer greatly during that particular war so it 's important to remember that . 
   we do n't have to measure anything as jews did it already . 
  i 'm happy with that . 
  remembering the individual cases where jewish were saved . 
  no need to invent silly statistics how the polish saved the most people or whatever . 
  history is not a rank . 
   what kind of mickey mouse logic is that ? 
  the same mickey mouse logic that states that one country saved more jews than another . 
  it 's a stupid statistic . 
  per capita of jewish population . 
   yep . 
  that change nothing , yes it does . 
  poland had 3.3 million jewish while other countries usually 10-50 times less ( unless we 're talking about ukraine ) . 
  apparently 300k jewish made it out . 
  let 's assume they were all saved by the polish . 
  ( it 's very difficult to make such an assumption cuz again who has the data and the analysis ? 
  you made a statement without backing up up but fine ) . 
  only 6 countries out of 20 or so that were involved in the holocausts even had more than 300k jewish at the beginning of the war . 
  so it 's not like you can save more than there are people to save . 
  any real analysis ( if such a thing were even possible ) would involve some sort of per capita numbers . 
   the wiki overview showed something else . 
  that 's because you poorly read the wiki page https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017 almost every time when jupp\u00e9 is running against mlp , he is * winning * . 
  you can see there are blank spots meaning we do n't know who will run sarkozy or jupp\u00e9 so that 's why you have polls that leave one or the other out . 
  but when jupp\u00e9 is picked , he 's topping the polls . 
   clearly french voters are motivated by similar sentiments i have no time to explain why you 're wrong ( besides the fact that you misread the polls ) and you are . 
  mlp ( just like jupp\u00e9 ) has the massive advantage of not being sarkozy nor hollande so they 'll obviously get a boost from that . 
  and we also do n't have a retarded system that gives a minority of votes a majority of seats or presidency . 
   poles saved the biggest amount of jews during wwii how do you measure that ? 
  poland also had the highest number of jewish people . 
  their decisions are declaratory but they can impose fines which are fairly steep . 
  and countries have agreed to change their laws to follow the decision of the court . 
  and it has already happened before that 's why extreme right parties usually love to say that if they get elected , they 'll remove their country from the echr . 
   le-pen will probably not win but she is top of the first round polls . 
  you should rechekc your sources http://www.europe1.fr/politique/presidentielle-juppe-toujours-favori-du-premier-tour-devant-le-pen-2882366 jupp\u00e9 would be at 35 % while mlp would be at 27 % . 
   the anti-eu , far-right is topping the polls polls for what ? 
   the anti-eu , far-right is topping the polls polls for what ? 
   it rarely happens that we do n't like something mama merkel says maybe you could have opposed the eu when brussels was telling switzerland that they have [ to allow free movement for croatia ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-eu-immigration-croatia-iduskcn0w60p7 ) . 
  it 's such bs when the eu is bullying smaller countries :(, 
   france where a 3 % difference lead to a 100 seat lead have you been smoking ? 
   if you have n't heard the ridiculous number of stories about racism in france you really ca n't have met many non-white people who have been there . 
  ah yes . 
  uk the land where racism no longer exists is teaching us a lesson . 
  how 's the bnp ? 
   the support for the conservatives has increased from ~ 34 % to ~ 43 % since david cameron stepped down , i 'm sorry . 
  i did n't know that if a poll says you 're winning then you no longer need elections . 
   considering the eu is currently going on a witch hunt and have taken the opportunity to completely exclude the alternative voice okay i 'll stop talking to you . 
  there are funner crazy people out there and better circle jerkers . 
  but hey keep practicing . 
  one day you 'll say something maybe worth replying to , 
   france , italy and spain are an awful lot bigger per capita bigger what per capita ? 
   so their immigration is n't really comparable yes it is . 
  it 's about at 12 % for every country i cited . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_immigrant_population  that the almost institutional racism experienced in france makes post-brexit racism look like child 's play . 
  what ? 
  stop the trolling . 
   germany is a lot less centralised and so migrants are more distributed unlike the uk where most are going to go to london . 
  okay , let 's look how london voted then : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36616028 oh . 
  seems like london voted to remain . 
  how gracious for the other brits to worry about them . 
   no uk prime minister has ever been democratically elected , so that 's a non-issue . 
  they 're the heads of the party . 
  would have as many people vote conservative if may were pm ? 
   should shoulda , woulda , coulda . 
  the fact of the matter is that if you compare uk and the eu , it 's not the eu or its citizens that need to `` grow up '' . 
  edit : also it 's not such an unlikely series of events . 
  you have a retarded electoral system , meaning 36 % of the votes gets you 51 % of the seats . 
  you should try representative democraties . 
  heard they 're pretty good . 
   that would be every prime minster in the uk though right ? 
  yeah but the pm usually is the head of the party . 
  which may was n't . 
   it is the eu 's second largest economy , is it now ? 
   grown-up negotiation to build a new eu-uk framework that can benefit all of europe by keeping the uk as a strong pillar of the european community as a continent . 
  there ** is a grown up ** solution to this but uk is acting childish and complaining about muh immigrants when actually the big 4 : germany , france , italy and spain have ** the same level of immigrants ** . 
  uk is the inconsistent , untrustworthy country with politicians that are flipping and flopping about . 
  cameron saying he 'll trigger art 50 then quiting . 
  may a head of state that has never been eelected democratically to her position . 
  a people that decided to hurt the economy for some bs reasons , a referendum that was never explicit in what the brexit should entail .
