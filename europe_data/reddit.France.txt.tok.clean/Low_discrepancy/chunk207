  eu has always expressed a direct and consistent message . 
  and it is doing it now again . 
  claiming that the eu is the one refusing `` grown-up '' negotiations is laughable . 
  the european project is simply sending the message that it is steadfast in continuing the project that has started decades ago . 
   us-produced services yeah . 
  a great amount of r&d went into that . 
  then we can only suppose then that the catholic god is n't the real one . 
  takes a hated elite to know hated elites . 
  and i have the impression brown was n't particularly loved . 
   the beauty of the old buildings we have around us ... 
  i read it 's just 100 years old . 
  which is n't thaaat old . 
  chop a head every minute . 
  twice a day , you 'll be right !, 
  not really . 
  cartoons and movies have nothing in common . 
  yeah . 
  i bet you watch miyazaki 's movies in japanese right ? 
   it 's such a shame that this is the case in so many countries in europe . 
  so i 'm guessing you 're quite proficient in japanese too . 
  all those miyazaki movies . 
  same goes for the simpsons in french . 
   out of sync with the mouths do n't watch sergio leone 's movies then . 
   and english vocabulary is half-germanic half-romance anyway https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/origins_of_english_piechart.svg/2000px-origins_of_english_piechart.svg.png 26 % germanic , 29 % french , 29 % latin, 
   to be fair that was n't the taxes but the bread it was a mix of factors but taxes was one reason indeed . 
  * the winter before was particularly harsh so crop yield were low . 
  this automatically raised the price of bread . 
  and even before you had several famines and several revolts from people : see the flour war of 1775 . 
  but the king obviously had a hand in this process . 
  he deregulated the grain market , he followed his advisor that suggested a `` laissez-faire '' policy . 
  before he had to guarantee that all regions of france were properly supplied in grain . 
  now , he removed himself . 
  saying he is for nothing is not accurate . 
  * taxes on commerce were actually collected at the borders of the different regions of france . 
  as such , when your wheat caravan would pass from one region to the other , you had to pay to pass . 
  here 's wiki on it : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_the_french_revolution#taxation with the harsh winters , the collectors got a bit too greedy , took too much and by the time the caravans reached paris , the cost was astronomical . 
  * due to the various wars france participated in , the country was in a severe economic crisis . 
  taxes grew once more . 
  * the system was impossible to reform . 
  the noblemen and the clergy would not pay any direct tax because they . 
  you could n't raise taxes from the rest of society anymore . 
  and creditors would start getting anxious that they might not see their money back . 
  i remember during the french revolution there were huge taxes . 
  guess what a loaf of bread would cost ? 
  58 euros . 
  true story , btw . 
   according of this article an average refugee family can take 1300 pln a month ( 400 euro ) . 
  yeah . 
  mom dad 2 kids . 
  that 's ** 100 ** euros monthly . 
  the minimum wage in poland is ** 400 ** euros . 
  congratulations , you are giving them ** one quarter of the minimum wage ** just like france is . 
   and it 's a mistake imho . 
  just shelter , food and after end of war free transport to home country . 
  you are giving every person ** 3 ** euros per day . 
  that 's 2 espressos in paris . 
  you must be some kind of crazy person if you think that 's too much . 
   according to this thread ` refugees ' that ` denied asylum seekers and illegal immigrants even get basic welfare which is about 400e per month . ', 
  amazing source there buddy . 
  another redditors . 
  well either way , if you 've been rejected for asylum , in france you stop getting anything . 
  oh and it 's about 300 euros , the aid . 
   ' it 's a big amount of money in ee countries . 
  well 300 euros is ** one quarter of the minimum salary ** in france . 
  so no that 's not big money . 
  take the minimum salary in poland and give them one quarter of that . 
  i doubt it would sound that impressive . 
  see , refugees wo n't ruin your economy , 
  are you stupid or just ignorant ' ? 
  it 's ** illegal ** to let die people whom you could have saved . 
   judging by our experience in sweden , people with no education and who do not value education will be a burden for generations . 
  sweden is not poland . 
  in sweden you have one of the highest added values activities . 
  for 9 million people , you guys make cars , planes , electronics etc. 
  poland for a 39 million country just is n't there . 
  i ca n't even name a single polish car . 
  so romania was the original : `` am i being detained ? 
  i am a sovereign citizen !, 
  did you check his name ? 
  the couple 's lucky they 're alive !, 
   what 's the point of having an eu if it benefits only the top 20 % of the european population while everyone else gets poorer and works harder ? 
  you should read more on the eu and poland , romania , bulgaria . 
  i know you 're not part of it but still , this level of ignorance is not acceptable . 
   now how do we negotiate when the other party ( eu ) again , the agreement ** switzerland signed ** has [ a guillotine clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillotine_clause ) . 
  do you want to suspend any of the 7 bilateral ** agree ** ments ( fom being the * first * one ) ? 
  well then all of them are suspended  we do n't have time to renegociate every ** agree ** ment every 17 years because switzerland got pissy . 
  that 's not how international politics works . 
   `` bullshit science from switzerland ? '', 
  epfl project . 
   this is why we want to change it . 
  well , good luck with being outside the single market . 
   but makes it harder for them to take a job that a local can do already and is willing to do is great in my opinion . 
  well , good luck with being outside the single market . 
   what the hell you expect that i am supposed to never return home ? 
  8 million people still live in switzerland and the vast majority are swiss . 
  maybe get the qualifications that allow you to live a comfortable live in switzerland ? 
   id rather live near my parents . 
  you should get a gypsy with a violin when you 're telling this story :'( . 
   there is the assumption that there is an equal ground for no discrimination , but there really is n't - wages in switzerland are higher it is not an equal ground to deserve no discrimination . 
  that is why more people come in than go out .
