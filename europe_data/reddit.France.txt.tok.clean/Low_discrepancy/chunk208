  you have no idea how open markets work , do you ? 
  corrected . 
   apparently the bilateral agreements that [ forbid discrimination based on nationality ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:22002a0430%2801%29:en:html ) do n't have a fancy name, 
   fucking up economically mutually beneficial bilateral agreements eu and switzerland signed an agreement . 
  if they wan na change it , then the old agreement must be scrapped and a new one signed . 
  it 's just like you can not ignore your constitution according to whatever wishes you have . 
  you have to vote a new constitution if you wan na change it . 
  edit : ~ ~ freedom of movement of people is an ** essential ** part of efta . ~ ~ # switzerland signed agreements that forbid discrimination based on nationality . 
  as per my previous comment . 
  when you went to germany , did your employer have to prove there is no eu person capable of doing your job ? 
  dude , you can do whatever you want , but the agreements switzerland signed are explicit . 
  ** no discrimination ** . 
   there is no way to make growth how do you make growth if at 3.2 % unemployment , you wan na kick out the foreigners ? 
  explain to me how that works . 
  your job market will get an absolute shock because it can not hire anymore . 
  wages will increase but so will the cost of living . 
  companies will have to compete by offering higher wages the few people that remained and in turn , their operation costs will also increase ... so now higher prices . 
  and how many companies will want to play this competition game instead of moving abroad where they can hire for less . 
  how on god 's green earth do you want growth when you know that getting out of efta means :  losing eu bilateral accords may cut output by as much as 7 percent of gdp by 2035 , and business leaders decry the impact on finding qualified staff . 
   the growth rate is 0.6 % . 
  welcome to western europe . 
  that 's our growth rate in the present . 
   we are in a liquidity trap and there is no way to raise wages because of the competition . 
  even if you eliminate the competition and increase wages , you still wont espace the liquidity trap . 
  in fact , by removing the competition , your gdp will drop . 
   the problem is the competition from immigration are you saying that the liquidity trap is because of foreigners ? 
  fuck ... is there something / r/europe wo n't blame on immigrants ? 
   switzerland is very expensive and you do n't get paid well you have a ** 100 % ** higher median wage than france . 
  and sorry to tell you this , but the cost of living is n't 100 % higher . 
  compared with ile de france , 12 million people , or london also 12 million or some people , you 're at the same level about of living costs . 
   i have left basically and work abroad because it is cheaper , i have no other choice . 
  at 3.1 % unemployment , you could n't find a job that suits you ? 
  wtf ? 
   syrian refugees ? 
  was n't isis created in an american prison ? 
  from former baath party members ? 
   we are not part of the eu neither will we ever be . 
  who said you were ? 
  do you like to invent arguments in your head ? 
   we are not part of the eu . 
  who said you were ? 
  do you like to invent arguments in your head ? 
   in consequence to 1 . we signed a bunch of billateral agreements . 
  none of which contained any mansion that private/public companies can not discriminate against eu nationals in the labor market . 
  mansion ? 
  you want agreements about mansions ? 
  but here ya go kiddo : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:22002a0430%2801%29:en:html  article 1  objective  the objective of this agreement , for the benefit of nationals of the member states of the european community and switzerland , is :  ( a ) to accord a right of entry , residence , access to work as employed persons , establishment on a self-employed basis and the right to stay in the territory of the contracting parties ;  ( b ) to facilitate the provision of services in the territory of the contracting parties , and in particular to liberalise the provision of services of brief duration ;  ( c ) to accord a right of entry into , and residence in , the territory of the contracting parties to persons without an economic activity in the host country ;  ** ( d ) to accord the same living , employment and working conditions as those accorded to nationals . 
  **  article 2  non-discrimination  nationals of one contracting party who are lawfully resident in the territory of another contracting party shall not , in application of and in accordance with the provisions of annexes i , ii and iii to this agreement , be the subject of any discrimination on grounds of nationality . 
  emphasis mine . 
  here 's efta https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association#free_movement_of_people_within_the_eea here 's other sources https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/fza_schweiz-eu-efta.html do n't be ignorant . 
  well i know you 'll continue to be , and that 's fine . 
  prepare for the guillotine clause . 
   do you seriously want to get into a debate about who has the most bloated bureaucracy and wasteful spending ? 
  read the article . 
  we threw 1 ** b ** illion euros down some retard 's pipe-dream of a project . 
  again that is in majority the fault of the eu . 
  who puts so much money on a `` we 'll make a brain ... in the computer '' ? 
   i am slowly watching france going down the shitter & nbsp ;  there is no point in feeding the troll ironic much ? 
   it was largely influenced by the salary drop that happened across the country you have the ** [ highest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) ** median wage in europe . 
  at ** 3.2 % ** you have the ** [ lowest ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_august_2016.png ) ** unemployment level in europe . 
  you know what ? 
  you people * should * reduce immigration . 
  with the massive shortage of workers that you 'll get that will result in increased salaries , your big companies wo n't stay too long . 
  and maybe we 'll stop funding bullshit science from switzerland at the tune of [ 1 billion euros ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-human-brain-project-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/ ) . 
   i 'm saying that the quota vote is a natural reaction to the current job market situation in the country . 
  holy fuck dude . 
  your unemployment levels are at ** 3.2 % ** . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/unemployment-rate here 's a long term graph http://www.indexmundi.com/switzerland/unemployment_rate.html are you out of your friggin mind to talk about 3.1 % unemployment and bitch about horrible job market situation ? 
  you have the ** lowest unemployment levels in europe ** https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/ should the eu eat cake instead ? 
  should the citizens of countries that host a vastly disproportional number of * international * organisations bitch about * international * workers ? 
   go and tell merkel about it asap . 
  well since the article i posted is about germany and merkel is the chancellor , i think she 's aware . 
  but hey great job at that shitpost , 
   they got liberated 98 years ago . 
  stop acting coy . 
  ** you ** liberated them !, 
   37.32 % turnout for eu parliament as validation . 
  one 's an election , the other is a referendum . 
  surely you can sense the difference . 
  you 'll need representatives no matter what . 
  referendums do not * have to pass * . 
   we have 25 % foreign nationals living and working in the country , more than germany , more than any other eu nation & nbsp ;  fifa check this wonderful list of international organisations that are headquartered in switzerland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_international_organizations_based_in_geneva . 
  for a country of 8 million people , do n't you think you 're pulling above your weight in terms of international organisations ? 
  you 're on 7th place in terms of contributions for cern for example yet the headquarters and the majority of investments take place in switzerland where you also have the majority of labs . 
  how does that work ? 
   similar percentage to those of `` refugees '' in western europe , many of which are coming from such war-torn countries as morocco or pakistan ... morocco has been added to the list of safe countries . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/2c6c6622-ca87-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0 you can also bother to answer the question . 
  how many ukrainians are getting sent back or sent to safe areas ? 
  what kind of country is that if 30 % is the threshold for a referendum to pass ? 
  here ya go https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/germany-content-to-return-afghan-asylum-seekers-to-islands-of-safety/ if afghans can be sent to safe zones , ukranians can also be sent to safe zones . 
   thanks britain !, 
  two parties , the eu and switzerland signed an agreement . 
  there are specific clauses set in place if the agreement is not respected . 
  what 's the point of being a 400 million strong group if an 8 million populated country can bully us around and decide to change the ** agree ** ments whenever they wish ? 
   that makes sense only if you think that ukrainians are somehow less `` worthy '' ... well how many of those ukrainian refugees come from a war zone and how many are deported because they can be sent to safe areas which most of ukraine is . 
  i was only pointing out libya is a larger problem for europe . 
  go to bed , you 're tired . 
   that said you can hardly blame today 's refugees from afghanistan on the us you deffo should go to bed dude . 
  you 're super tired . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about .
