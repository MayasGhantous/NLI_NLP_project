   even the eu states it is safe no . 
  eu declares there are * regions * of afghanistan which are safe . 
  so they send them there . 
  major cop out . 
  https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/germany-content-to-return-afghan-asylum-seekers-to-islands-of-safety/ but even that is n't done for all refugees . 
  syria and afghanistanthanks for that . 
  maybe one day you 'll bother cleaning the mess you created in that area ... 
  let 's see here . 
   actually , the french president holds a massive amount of prerogatives in virtue of the french constitution . 
  he gets to nominate the prime minister ( article 8 ) and presides over the council of ministers ( article 9 ) . 
  the us does n't even have a pm , just a secretary of state . 
   also , articles 38 gives the president and the prime minister huge amounts of power with regard to law initiative through `` ordonnances '' that again is not exceptional . 
  apparently also in germany , the federal govt can introduce bills . 
   french parliament can not overthrow the government . 
  the french parliament can block all and any laws suggested by the govt . 
  we 've seen how nasty periods of cohabitation are ... decrees can only last so long . 
   not to mention article 16 , which states that in case of emergencies in which the very state of france sees itself threatened , the french president can give himself `` les pleins pouvoirs '' , or exceptional powers , meaning that he can pass any law without the needing of approval from parliament . 
  that 's a very normal thing . 
  here 's a list https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_emergency it 's a state of war , what do you expect ? 
  i 'm not saying that the french president is weak , on the contrary . 
  but in the grand scheme of things , there 's nothing exceptional . 
  i 'd rate him about as powerful as the us president . 
  one has the right to veto , the other has the right to dissolve the assembly . 
  in all the rest , they 're basically even . 
  yeah but laws do n't apply retroactively . 
  so the brits like roast beef ? 
  interesting . 
  never knew that . 
  how will a petition help ? 
  wait ? 
  you mean it maybe was n't about spiting the flems ? 
  like they had valid concerns and shit ? 
  do you not think it a reasonable observation that the quote starts with an assertion that england is insular , and then goes on to describe something which is very much not insular ? 
  read insular as not continental . 
  which uk has shown time and time again . 
   it 's also worth keeping in mind that the quote on the insular nature of england is by the person who withdrew the french military from nato command , which looks like an insular policy to me . 
  nato created a system that subdued european defense interests to the us . 
  it was used to bully the continent in following us desires and policies and it was never intended to be in the greated good of the region . 
  it was meant such that if war were to happen , it should take place in europe and waste the whole continent . 
  de gaulle realised that nato was no in the best interests of france and he did his own thing . 
  france was the only nato country ( bar us ) that had the 3 strike capacity ( sea , air and land missiles ) . 
  france is the only country that makes its own nukes and own planes , its own missiles and lauchers . 
  france is also happy to share . 
  we would n't have had the rafale if the eurofighter had n't gone in a weird direction ( but it 's good that we did since it 's a superior fighter ) . 
  also , france was instrumental in creating the eu , the euro , schengen and other endeavours like airbus , esa and cern . 
  when 's the last time uk came to the continent and offered to pool resources ? 
  the concorde ? 
  that 's a bit dated do n't you think ? 
  uk has military plans with the us , it goes campaigning in iraq , it builds planes together , it spies for the us . 
   the only reason they 're not is the view ( which i 'm open to being wrong ) oh we have other things : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_european_union_by_gdp and there 's another missing phrase from his speech . 
  http://geopolis.francetvinfo.fr/brexit-quand-de-gaulle-disait-non-a-l-angleterre-dans-l-europe-109583 just before that quote he says :  the nature , the nature of england differ profoundly from those of the continentals . 
  the speech is geared towards agriculture , uk importing a lot of agricultural goods from the americas while the common market was about being self sustained . 
  hence the many differences . 
  he was also opposed to making the community too large because it would create too many divergent interests . 
  but still it seems that his point is clear , there 's uk on an island and the continentals . 
  i doubt you 'll agree that uk is very attached to the continent . 
  200k refugees we can handle . 
  1.5 million we ca n't . 
   ( if you had the smallest idea at how much damn i give about that so called language ) show how petty you are . 
  ironic much ? 
  let 's reopen your shitty lemonde article . 
  they were ** published ** but the measures to apply them were not put in place by the govt . 
  sure apparently some others were not published in the journal officiel but that 's not fucking because the president is vetoing them . 
  it 's because the system to make them applicable was n't put in place . 
   in other word , if the president decide ( sic ) not to agree with a law and refuse to sign it it 's `` decides '' , did you ever have an english class ? 
  but again did you fucking read the your own shitty article ? 
  they just were n't published but that 's not his friggin job . 
  now can you please give it a rest ? 
  you can bother reading the full quote here :  ` england in effect is insular , she is maritime , she is linked through her interactions , her markets and her supply lines to the most diverse and often the most distant countries ; she pursues essentially industrial and commercial activities , and only slight agricultural ones . 
  she has , in all her doings , very marked and very original habits and traditions . ', 
   yes , hundred of laws that the president has to sign are waiting to be signed since up the 11 years , yet did you read your own friggin link ? 
  ** the laws have been passed ** and they 're good to go . 
  it 's just that in the majority of cases , the govt also needs to create measures in order to * apply * the laws . 
  which is a completely different matter and sometimes the govt does n't bother . 
  that has ** nothing ** to do with the president . 
  the laws are ** valid ** . 
   when the president has the majority of the assembly is with him , he could be a kind of a god effectively controlling both the executive and the legislative power so does obama . 
  sadly the reps have the control of congress . 
  also no he is n't god . 
  he has no power to remove any mp that votes against him . 
  they can very well decide to vote against the wishes of the govt . 
   with no higher political authority . 
  except the constitutional court . 
   and obama ca n't dissolve the parliament , hollande can . 
  it 's not like he can dissolve and name who he wants . 
  he dissolves it and new elections take place . 
  heck in the uk before 2011 it was very easy to call for snap elections . 
   he does n't need to . 
  he just has to ignore them . 
  he can not ignore it undefinitely . 
  after 15 days , he has to sign it . 
  it 's right there in the text . 
  your le monde article has nothing to do with the president . 
   it 's not entirely wrong to say that . 
  compared to other democracies , the president of france has a lot of power and responsibilities . 
  why not compared with the most powerful country out there ... yeah you 'll find that the french president has fewer powers than the potus . 
  for example the french president can not veto laws , while us presidents ... oh boy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_presidential_vetoes, 
  you are free to show in what way you are independent to the us . 
  you 're tired . 
  go to bed !,
