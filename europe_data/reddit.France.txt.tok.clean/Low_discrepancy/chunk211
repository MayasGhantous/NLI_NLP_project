  from the outside it seemed fine but apparently it is crappy as fuck . 
  i mean there are stastics that indeed show you 're in deep shit http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=en i mean poverty rates for over 50 + yo are 40 % higher than in france . 
  for 65 + it 's 100 % higher . 
  and if i look at who voted for brexit , the vast majority come from 45 + yos . 
  i mean we can look at how many foreigners you have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_europe#statistic_data_on_immigrant_populations france 11.6 % , germany 11.9 , uk 12.4 % of the population . 
  it 's weird ya know how other countries seem to manage , but uk is slowly falling apart . 
  i 'd say that it 's your pisspoor politicians that have continuously made your country more and more unequal . 
  but hey , if you think it 's immigrants ... be my guest , even though ** you have the most fucking educated immigrants ** . 
   i 'm sure they will be more than thrilled to earn many times their polish salary here in the uk i 'm sure they 'll be more than thrilled to go to germany . 
  those that did , did n't immediatly see 15 % of their income melt away cuz the brits wanted to be independent . 
  we 're talking about us policies post 1900 and especially post 1950 here when the expansion stopped . 
   uk immigration comes with a lot of short term , `` per migrant '' gains , but it also means huge upfront costs such as building schools , hospitals and transport that only pay themselves off in the long term . 
  [ eu immigrants are more educated than the natives ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/08/mapped-how-britain-has-the-highest-level-of-skilled-migration-in/ ) . 
  they give more to the economy than they take . 
  stop reading brexit leaflets man cuz it 's just sad . 
   who have the idea that halal slaughter practices are unnecessarily cruel , they refuse to eat halal meat . 
  88 % of halal meat in uk has been obtained from animals that [ were stunned ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/08/what-does-halal-method-animal-slaughter-involve ) . 
  that cruelty reason kinda flies out the window , does n't it ? 
  i would generally refuse to eat any meat that did n't involve the stunning of the animal . 
  apparently a lot of halal does involve stunning , some doesnt . 
  it 's confusing . 
  jewish slaughtering shechita forbids stunning though . 
   to answer you question , i care about all of them of course you care about all of them . 
  but you focus just one some , 
  okay so it was the 129 cases that bothered you , not the 396 others . 
   also , for brexiters is n't scaring migrants away the point ? 
  well i 'm not talking to brexiters . 
  i was talking ( before he turned full derp hurr durr france failed hurr durr ) to people like / u/lupinechemist who ridiculously think you can have a successful immigrant community all the while reducing migration and making it more tough to be one . 
  because `` you just got ta pick the smarties '' !, 
  such a thing does not exist . 
  if you do n't allow slack , you do n't get success . 
   look at canada and australia if you want to see successful skill based programs . 
  what is australia a success of ? 
  they 're 23 million people ( a ridiculously tiny population ) living on a * friggin * continent . 
  they 're a success of basically nothing : look at their exports https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/australian_exports_treemap_%282009%29.jpg it 's in the ** majority ** just stuff they pull from the ground . 
  that 's like saying saudi arabia is a success . 
  it has a population of 35 million and they 're immediatly adjacent to the largest economy in the friggin world . 
   that france fucked the execution does n't mean it 's a bad idea . 
  yeah . 
  marie curie , platini , chopin , cohen-tannoudji , zidane , jean-jacques goldman , coluche , gamebetta , edith piaf , even friggin valls and sarkozy . 
  you 're fucking ignorant and i 'll stop the convo here . 
  in terms of circle jerks i 've seen better than what you 're offering . 
   also mass migration to the us was helped by wiping out the old population the dwindling native american population happened before the us ever started being considered as a serious destination for immigrants . 
   is what appears to be ever increasing migration from the eu and the inability to control it . 
  that eu migration to uk is a net benefit . 
  if you reduce it , you reduce how much money you receive . 
  your fellow countrymen are under the false belief that if they kock the polish plumber out , that creates room for the pakistani heart surgeon . 
  which is ridiculous . 
  you 'll just have less money cuz again ... eu migrants are net benefits . 
  and by clamping down on migration , you are not exactly creating a favourable environment for any migrant . 
  you can say you 'll accept polish doctors and just kick out polish plumbers , but i doubt those doctors will be so thrilled about such a situation . 
   it is interesting that everywhere refugees show up refugees did n't show up in this article . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  or if you read the whole article :  both police and academics say that the higher figures may reflect higher rates of reporting , rather than an actual rise in the number of sex crimes . 
  a person a might react differently if long time friend b puts their hands on a 's ass without consent vs random person on the street putting their hands on a 's ass without consent . 
  the action is the same and has the same seriousness , but the police might hear about one and not the other . 
  did you bother reading what / u/thelastgoodemperor wrote ? 
  you ** can not ** have a common market without movement of labour . 
  even economists as far back as adam smith knew that . 
  if the uk wants to reduce immigration , they are free to remove themselves from the common market and suffer the consequences , like having euro-pound equivalency . 
  do you even know how trying to become restrictive on immigration works ? 
  / u/helm gave you an idea . 
  i 'll help you out even more because france had a derpy idea in 2011 like that . 
  uni graduates that did n't have a job in 6 months , had to leave . 
  this created a completely unbearable system for professors , students and everybody . 
  people were fucking stressed because suddenly their classmates with whom they spent 3-4-5 years together were at risk of being removed from a country they began to see as part of their own . 
  that 's how it works . 
  you start removing people , you have to tell them to leave , you can no longer accept promissing people because some bullshit reasons from either : * 1 / xenophobic people who think deyr tekkin er jerbs * 2 / people like you who only give a theoretical * and very superficial * analysis of the situation . 
   and what the fuck does us illegal immigration or start up fail rates have to do with anything ? 
  any human endeavor is successful if it allows for failure and progress . 
  us immigrational system back in the day or the current sillicon valley system , they work because they allow for failure and progress . 
  the us penal system fails because it allows for no failure and progress . 
   will contribute more than accepting people with no secondary education . 
  yes . 
  you want to remove people who want to progress . 
  great job !, 
  success is n't some magical thing that happens out of the blue . 
  it involves hard work , it involves slack , it involves things that completely fail . 
  with no risk , comes no reward and uk is going on the path of 0 risk . 
  their choice . 
  but it 's stupid to claim it will have the same success . 
  us has a long history of being fairly open to immigration : from the 1800s with the germans and irish , 1900s with the italians etc. 
  claiming you want to be a successful country at attracting talent all while restricting immigration heavily is ridiculous even if you magically invent concepts like `` only for skilled workers '' . 
  i gave the example of silicon valley : it 's successful because they allow failure up to unprecedented rates . 
  uk wants a system where they no longer allow failure for immigrants and only the upper crust . 
  success does n't come by magically handpicking all the ingredients . 
  it comes by trying everything that fails . 
  having a large pool of people gives more opportunities . 
   britain being an island can control its borders more effectively than any continental member states . 
  yes . 
  because people coming to france are going on mountain trails through the pyrenees and the alps rights ? 
  it will honestly probably be easier for skilled immigrants from non-eu countries afterward and skilled eu labor will certainly be allowed as well . 
  ah yes . 
  the magical beautiful unicorn that is called `` we 'll just let in the skilled ones '' . 
  that 's the key to success . 
  just like only buying great football players and only investing in start ups that will be successful , right ? 
  that 's how the us works right ? 
  they have no illegal immigrants and all silicon valley start ups are successful , right ? 
  :') you we 're missed . 
  take some time off the campaign trail and drop one or two of those golden nuggets on / r/europe .
