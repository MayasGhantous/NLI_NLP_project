  how 's that relevant to the topic ? 
   what she said pre-referendum may just have been because she had to say those things . 
  and now we 're seeing the true may right ? 
   what an optimistic bunch you brits are . 
   and has scrapped the largest of them , like the akula class , it was large because the ussr did n't have the essential know how needed to miniaturise h bombs . 
  therefore they needed larger missiles than the us , therefore they needed larger subs than the us . 
  smaller is better . 
  suck it netherlands !, 
  greek macedonia ? 
  what 's that ? 
  i mean macedonia macedonia . 
  you know ... with alexander and stuff . 
  i 'm talking about the * real * macedonia man . 
   which is what this particular thread was about . 
  did you read the thread ? 
  / u/zicklein said that ceta was scary when the guy he replied to talked about 200k losing their jobs and companies having the right to sue govts for perceived loss of benefits . 
  / u/jtalin asked why it 's scary . 
  ( because reading 2 comments before is tough apparently ) . 
  / u/mr-oldfart went the way his name implies and derped out some shitty comment about how / u/zicklein is scared about the cap . 
  tl ; dr : read the comments people . 
   on a level playing field eh . 
  there are 4 eu countries that export more than canada ( france being one of them , +50 % ) . 
  doubt anyone is shaking in their boots . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-american-food-giant-the-largest-exporter-of-food-in-the-world.html ), 
  what 's that have to do with the walloons rejecting ceta ? 
   legislation legal system in canada is based on [ common law ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/map_of_the_legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png ) . 
  as you can see it 's quite different from continental europe . 
   overall relations again if we 're talking about uk , yeah . 
  but concerning the rest of europe , i do not think they 're particularly warm or anything . 
  romania and bulgaria still need a visa to visit . 
  canada added a visa for czechia a few years ago before removing it . 
  and economy ? 
  they 're not that linked . 
  and the estimated benefit from ceta is about 2 billion euros per year . 
  for a region the size of the eu , that 's not exactly mind blowing . 
   canada is very similar to europe culturally . 
  what does that have to do with trade ? 
  when you go shopping , do you select the seller that is the closest to you culturally ? 
  canada does n't owe us and we do n't owe it anything . 
  they 're not our special , magical friend . 
  they 're a counterparty to a treaty . 
  if a country thinks the treaty is non beneficial ( and there are good reasons to believe that ) they will reject the treaty . 
  it has nothing to do with values , ideals , hopes , dreams . 
  someone forgot to colour in macedonia and montenegro . 
   but the general trend remains to describe pretty much every right wing party as such . 
  that 's populism . 
  even if you were proven wrong , you still continue hammering the same beat because `` general trend '' . 
  trump would be proud . 
   it ca n't even conclude a deal with probably the most european country outside of europe ? 
    that makes 0 sense . 
  yeah dude . 
  we french people spend our day thinking about the cap . 
  just like brits constantly think about the city . 
   here in italy they spared no words for describing them populist and xenophobic . 
  the give friggin sources on ovp being populist . 
  i sure wan na read that . 
  cuz you 're bsing . 
   italian right wing berlusconi was a populist . 
  he was an idiot that should have gone to jail a few times and that made your country a laughing stock . 
   austrian right wing party ** nobody ** has called the ovp a populist party . 
   pretty much everything right wing . 
  i think you know next to nothing about european politics . 
  torries , cdu , ump , pp . 
  here 's the major 4 right wing parties from 4 major european countries . 
  and they 've never been called populists in any real context . 
  stop imagining things . 
   now there 's been an abuse of this term lately where virtually all right wing parties calm down buddy . 
  i doubt the cdu or ump have ever been labelled populist . 
  ever hear of something called ** op ed ** ? 
  if not , go google it buddy , 
  dnft . 
  i prefer the weegie . 
   a digital english version though ? 
  a british person will buy from a british store with a british credit/debit card that is connected to a british billing address . 
  so they 're buying a localised ( and not a localized btw ) version . 
   well into other democratic beliefs . 
  i was surprised to see even france ( ! ), 
  ahead of germany in public attitudes , given how much the french love to prosecute speech . 
  we 're starting the \u00b0 '' ' early today . 
  what office employee needs word macros that involve thousands of lines ? 
   1.6 % , so adding 0.3 i wrote ** 0.03 % ** . 
  http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/06/ceta-canadian-ttip-what-is-it/ and it could be 0.01 % . 
  so it could be some 2 billion euros ... 
  so it 's best to write it in word ? 
  right ? 
  so if they want a doxygen doc in a nice big pdf , with god forbid 1-2 mathematical formulas ? 
  what the heck do you do ? 
  still use word for that ? 
   they 've been overcharging uk prices are higher in europe . 
  such is life . 
   dunno what percentage of time was actually lost due to non-familiarity , but it was in there . 
  you miss my point . 
  i gave examples of stuff you can not do without . 
  they 're things you learn when you get your education ...  i 've written more material in latex than word over the past twenty years & nbsp ;  i definitely would take longer to dash off a formatted document in latex than microsoft office even today . 
  you 're just bsing now . 
   as for latex , it 's too difficult to learn properly and there is no good editor for latex for the end-user . 
  what kind of company are you working at man ? 
   how many hours did it take you to learn latex ? 
  how many hours did it take you to learn c++ , matlab , git , matplotlib ? 
  latex at a certain level becomes an essential tool .
