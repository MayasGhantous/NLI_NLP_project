  surely those 14 billions might deffo help a great deal !, 
  it starts during st nick or kinda before iirc and ends during xmas . 
  but that has no bearing on the parliament ( not directly ), 
  did orban just give you a bkk ? 
   the most voted party to form a government you need a presidential system like france or the usa . 
  you 're mixing everything . 
   all these people who complain about the lack of democracy a just because people vote , that does n't make it a democracy . 
  several voting systems are severely flawed such as fptp . 
  in other cases , information may not be readily available or might be tampered with . 
  claiming the democratic process or that state of law are simple things is quite silly, 
  we have the correct answer . 
  if a lock on a bridge can bring eternal love , why ca n't a comment on reddit bring a painful death and damnation ? 
  it 's not that prevalent , just 2 bridges were targetted and it also happens in other cities . 
  i get it , some people think it 's a romantic gesture . 
  i 'm just saying that those people should die a horrible death . 
   those locks are a part of that , for better or worse . 
  no they 're not . 
  they 're very recent , starting in about 2008 . https://nolovelocks.com/faq/ so fuck anyone who does it . 
  you should try independence some time  . 
  heard it implies fewer iraqi wars . 
  because it ends of looking like [ this ] ( http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/18964/locket_bridge.jpg ) which is the ugliest thing possible . 
  and they might end up falling which [ happened in 2014 ] ( http://www.radiovl.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bpnj00yciaaxies.jpg ) closing the bridge for a bit . 
  they 're changing the metal mesh with transparent plastic but idiots still find a way ( although it 's less obnoxious ) . 
  similar traditions exist in romania though they look more like your generic [ scary masked people ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnxe_fwrtw4 ) than goat devils . 
  that being said , i hope those people that put lock ~ ~ et ~ ~ s on bridges die a horrible death . 
  you 're welcome . 
   we can now call it even , then ? 
  ah yes . 
  i heard about that . 
  post-truth politics . 
  you 'll love trump man  but thanks for the forks . 
   you do n't respect anything our government say ? 
  because you should present proof when making a comment ... 
   without credit rating agencies we 'd have to trust banks wait what ? 
  you 're basically trusting banks . 
  especially when financial products are concerned . 
  it 's the banks that are the clients and it 's the banks that pay . 
  yeah but once summer comes , you 're out . 
  i would be ** very ** amazed if these people count as having moved out . 
  what should matter is your permanent address , not your campus address . 
  hey . 
  that 's just big boned !, 
   can a british local care to share an opinion on this ? 
  did you bother asking many british people if they have relatives that made such statements ? 
  cuz you might get very different answers . 
  like / u/supergavio said it can be a regional thing . 
  it can also be an age gap thing where you interact primarily with younger people than with older ones . 
  http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ look at thevote discrepancies between 20yos and 65 + yos . 
   from genuine concern and well founded fear . 
  the same can be said by the brits . 
  there 's an actual concern that immigration causes downward pressure for those unskilled workers for example . 
  fascinating crap . 
  if only we 'd have slave labour . 
  it 's funny how the rolling of the r sounds like old timey radio french from the 40s . 
  [ they never listen !, 
  ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/de-gaulle-knew-it-britain-does-not-belong-in-the-eu/ ), 
   france will be left with its delusions of grandeur like usual truly europe has top notch health care . 
  even people with severe intellectual deficiencies can benefit from internet access !, 
   wto is not that bad . 
  have you already started your weekend partying or something and as such are tripping balls ? 
  have you checked the pound and where it 's trading ? 
  and that 's with the uk in the eu . 
  imagine if you wo n't be in the eea . 
  dude , did you bother reading what / u/trucidator said ? 
  ** believe ! ** . 
  now get your ruby shoes and start hitting those heels . 
  because that 's how the economy works !, 
  really ? 
  is ceta signed  ? 
   that 's how competition works . 
  but so far they have managed to stay in business in a european market this kinda shows you know very little about how the cap works . 
  if it 's the same thing in wallonia as in france , the farmers are really struggling . 
  and in france they get a ton of subsidies . 
  who had the stupid idea of giving belgian regional parlaments the power to veto trade deals ? 
  dude ... 
  it 's like i 'm talking to a wall . 
  eu can not imposeto be treated like one country because ** the eu is not a federation ** . 
  my passport is not the same as a romanian passport is not the same as a german passport is not the same as a czech passport and i can continue for ages . 
  the day eu will become a federation , sure . 
  it will be treated as a whole . 
  but that day is not today nor is it in the near nor even distant future . 
  there is no european nationality . 
  they invented a eu citizenship but it has basically 0 connexions with a real citizenship . 
  and sure canada might bend towards our will ( though wallonia threw a spanner in the works and now ceta is yesterday 's deal ) but in the case of the us , there was n't even a hint that they might remove visas for bulgaria and romania for the ttip . 
  let the eu become a federation and we 'll talk . 
   except in some matters it gets treated like a single state apples and oranges . 
   when did i say that ? 
  you talked about cornwall and uk and romania and the eu . 
  do you have a cornwall passport ? 
  does cornwall have borders and an army to protect them from any other uk region ? 
  can cornwall decide at any moment to have a referendum and quit uk ? 
  your comparison makes no sense whatsoever . 
  the eu is n't a federation , is n't a state . 
  if a romanian gets deported from canada he wo n't be sent to cornwall or uk . 
  if a cornwellian gets deported from canada , he 'll be sent to london not cornwall . 
   you can , i just did . 
  are you joking ? 
  tell me you 're joking . 
  you can not possibly think that your britsh passport and romanian permanent address makes you equivalent to any romanian citizen inside romania . 
  if you think otherwise why do n't you try and vote for national elections .
