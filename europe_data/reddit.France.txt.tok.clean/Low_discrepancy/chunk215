  once you live in a region of france for example , you can vote for regional elections . 
  now you live in romania so you can vote in romanian elections . 
  right ? 
  you have a british passport , romanians have a romanian passport . 
  you can get deported from romania , a romanian can not . 
  the eu can wish for many thinks but until it becomes a federation , those wishes wont become reality . 
   i 'm not saying canada has no right to really ? 
  because your comment states otherwise ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58m5te/romania_and_canada_come_to_an_agreement/d91kjpy/  i was trying to say that eu could have pressured canada the eu did raise this issue beforehand and it did challenge canada when it put visas in place for the czech republic ( rightfully so actually since a lot of czech romas were overstaying their visas and asking for asylum ... wtf ? ) . 
  enough with this `` eu so mean '' bs . 
   it 's quite ridiculous for bulgaria and romania to accept ceta because canadians would be doing business in them without restrictions and when a bulgarian or romanian would like to do business in canada they would need visas ... 
  joke ? 
  canadian citizens already do n't need a visa to travel to romania or bulgaria . 
  why is that ? 
  why do n't you introduce them ? 
  either way , it 's ridiculous to claim , * as you already did * , that canada has no reason to ask for visas for romania and bulgaria . 
  bulgarians over stay they visas and romania has high refusal rates . 
  oh , others on this thread are the same . 
  you 'd think their dads fought in said war or something ... 
   bulgarians and romanians do not have control over the refusal rate they basically know what the major factors for refusing a visa : not sufficient means to live there , not presenting sufficient reasons that you wo n't overstay , that you have sufficient reasons to remain in the country . 
  it 's all classic stuff , i doubt there 's anything special . 
  and some countries do get removed from the visa program . 
  like it happened to the czech republic because too many romas was overstaying and applying for asylum . 
  considering the state france is in now ( and other european countries ) i do not find it at all excessive to think that canada will soon suffer similar problems . 
   just like they would n't block cornwall if it had an 8 % violation rate while the uk has 0 . x % is a whole . 
  that does n't make a lick of sense . 
  you ** can not ** compare cornwall in uk to romania in the eu . 
   people were worried canada would go back on their word and find another reason why they would n't lift the need for visas that can already happen if you do not respect the conditions to be in the canadian visa exemption program . 
  canada wo n't have any problem introducing visas even after removing as it happened with the czech republic, 
   i 'm just starting to loose what exactly are you trying to prove ? 
  obviously . 
  because you 're the on that says canada has no right to impose visas . 
  which is absolutely ** ridiculous ** . 
  no one 's denying romanian 's veto right here . 
   what exactly do bulgaria and romania `` do not respect '' ? 
  3 % immigration violation and visa refusal rates of less than 3 % for 3 years running . 
  bulgaria has a ** 4.4 % ** violation rate and ** 15.7 % ** refusal rate . 
  romania had ** 2.7 % ** violation rate and ** 15 % ** refusal rate . 
   canada only said it is open to negotiate the lifting of the visas after romania threatened some months ago that it would block ceta . 
  as per the article states :  ini\u021bial , calendarul prevedea ridicarea total\u0103 a vizelor \u00een mai 2018 . 
  the initial calendar was for may 2018 . 
   the romanian authorities 's job is to fight for the right of the romanian citizens and this is what they 've done they created pointless dissent . 
  visas would have been removed but now ceta is bogged down in wallonia . 
  instead of doing this behind the scenes they created this big issue . 
  ceta did not need for more reasons why it should n't pass . 
  yes . 
  but canada agreed to remove visas for romanians . 
  just that the romanians got all uppity and wanted to remove them immediately . 
  a country has the right to decide who can and can not enter it 's territory . 
  and i think romania and bulgaria do n't respect the visa free travel requirements . 
  pretty sure canada said it would remove visas . 
  this was just a piss match because they wouldnt do it as fast as romanians wanted . 
  would 6 months of waiting have killed you ? 
  it just created a pointless dissent that might see this deal shelved and you guys without any visa . 
   lol you 'd have to be stupid not to . 
  i mean i 'm all for it . 
  this type of aggravating attitude only serves to annoy the rest of the eu . 
  nothing helps unity as fighting a common enemy which the uk is adamant of becoming . 
  indeed . 
  i shall do like everyone here and downvote you , 
  so all this hullabaloo over just * 6 * months ? 
  not to mention that 'll be dead in the water if the walloons disagree . 
   always funny how people think they 're speaking for some huge crowd . 
  i can see you 're not from europe . 
  so butt out , 
  yeah . 
  we were n't expecting uk to bow out gracefully . 
  the era of gentleman behaviour has long passed over there . 
  unilever posts it 's profits in euros . 
  say they make 2 pounds profit . 
  they have to convert those 2 pounds to euros before telling the world how much they make . 
  before it was 3 euros profit now it 's 2 euros profit . 
  welcome to multinationals . 
  the weaker pound ate up their profits and as such they wan na hike up prices . 
  for a multinational with tens of brands and hundreds of products , that 's how it works . 
  or would you have each company post how many euros they made in eurozone countries , how many dollars on the us , how many pounds in uk , how many zloty is poland how many zimbabwean dollars in zimbabwe etc etc etc ? 
   making animals suffer for pleasure . 
  indeed it is horrible and disgusting . 
  darn i need a few slices of bread to go with my foie gras . 
  i hope that since he found out how trade in different currencies works . 
  was n't there an uk mp that wanted a boycott of marmite in favour of vegemite ? 
  because apparently australia works on the pound . 
  yeah . 
  we 've heard all of this before . 
  chirac is done , sarkozy is done etc etc. 
  it ai n't over till it 's over . 
  who knew that if you try to oppress something people would be more adamant about it ? 
  i do n't think we 're that obsessed about football . 
  muslims ... yeah ... football ... not so much . 
   the eu is dead oh wow . 
  first time i 've ever seen such a comment !, 
  how original . 
   i doubt she would even try with christian symbols due to the pressure from the church and the subsequent loss of votes that would result from that . 
  you do n't know how france works , do you ? 
  did you just compare apples to oranges ? 
   they should pay for it , end of story . 
  did the banks pay for the crisis ? 
  which also hit romania and had to get loans from the imf . 
   what tusk is saying is that there will be negociations without allowing british to much . 
  yeah tusk is waaay over stepping his boundaries . 
  it 's completely feasible for the uk go remain in the eea and if he thinks german and french leaders are excluding that hypothesis he must be out of his mind .
