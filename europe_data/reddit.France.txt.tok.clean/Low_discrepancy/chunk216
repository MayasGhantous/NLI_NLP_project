  hard brexit or no brexit is explicitly ** no ** negotiations . 
  obviously uk will leave . 
  so according to him that means hard brexit . 
  i think he overestimates the amount of political power he has . 
  it 's a complete difference between having tough negociations and having ** no ** negociations . 
  dude . 
  stop trying to push the limit lower : /, 
  juncker during brexit was one of the few times i liked the dude . 
  he said it in clear terms that the eu wo n't bend over backwards to please uk . 
  which was the correct stance . 
  it sets some friggin principles for once . 
  is this the week polish politicians have gone the deep end ? 
  first airbus , the kaczynsky ( or whatever that 's spelt like ) , the the fork comment now this ? 
  what 's wrong with these people ? 
   would you buy a car that was programmed to kill you under certain circumstances ? 
  ever been in a plane ? 
   the french , do n't talk me about those , it seems as if the irrationality since when can we easily tolerate bigotry on / r/europe . 
  we know there 's an extremely low intellectual barrier to comment on here . 
  do n't you have store brands that are for all intended purposes identical ( or nearly identical ) to the original , more famous brand but they compete with the original by slashing prices ? 
  is it a special recipe that can not be reproduced because of the secrets it involves ? 
  because there are tons of brands that make butter and it 's all the same . 
  wow . 
  first sensible comments from you . 
  what happened ? 
   then i would bet that the pound will also go back up before too long . 
  if we 're looking at a soft brexit , yes i 'd take that bet . 
  if it 's a hard brexit , neah . 
  it can still fall . 
  do n't you have generic brand marmite ? 
   the initial rebellion had nothing to do with iraq and would still have happened . 
  what do you consider the initial rebellion ? 
  why is the shia-sunni civil war in iraq not included and not a determinant part of why it 's such a massive cluster fuck ? 
   the blame lies on russia 's ally . 
  of course the majority of blame lies with assad but still . 
   you would have the exact same generals under the support of an enemy nation the iraqi generals should n't have been cast aside then ? 
  or maybe not cause a war in iraq ? 
  how about that ? 
   whats your beef with countries not wanting to be part of a pan-eu army ? 
  what beef ? 
  has anyone forced ireland to be part of this ? 
  if so , when ? 
  and up to now it 's just france germany spain and italy . 
  do they have the right for very close military cooperation and interoperability ? 
   i would n't say the nazis were the beacon of morality and corecct behaviour the nazis were against smoking . 
  should we go a separate route because they were the nazis ? 
  if a majority of people in sudeten wanted to join another country , why is that automatically bad ? 
  up to now , you are refusing to answer the main question . 
  what 's your beef with countries joining forces ? 
  a `` eu army '' would not even be in the framework of the eu because again the eu does n't have these types of laws . 
  it is being constructed now from the ground up and not top down . 
  with countries joining forces . 
  france germany spain and italy want to cooperate at this point . 
  others can join if they so wish . 
  what 's your beef ? 
   no need to play semantic i am not playing semantics . 
  i am stressing the important distinctions between the two . 
  when you play doomsday like / u/unskialz is doing , it 's always better to go for the extra bit of scare . 
  i am still confused . 
  why would you even care what other countries do with their armies ? 
  for me country has a much closer meaning than state , do n't you think ? 
  scotland has been a country for centuries upon centuries . 
  but part of uk for what ? 
  250 years ? 
  well this is n't journalism . 
  this is an op ed . 
  if we treat russian op eds as an absolute 0 , then this one is n't far from it . 
  caustic bs does not lack on both sides of this debate . 
   yep , americans started arab spring in syria . 
  / s wait is n't it well known that the iraq war was a massively destabilising factor in the region , that isis basically started life inside an us prison and that a lot of high ranking isis members were ex baathist that were cast aside in the new modern iraq ? 
  not saying that the us caused it , but it was a huge part in it happening . 
   what if an individual nation needs to declare war , but they are a part of the eu army ? 
  did the us not manage to start wars even though nato countries like germany were against it . 
  ( like the iraq war ) ? 
  are you against nato ? 
  since when does the eu want to start wars ? 
  the eu does not even have such a framework . 
  and i want uk to give me 5 euros every day ( not pounds because they are becoming worthless :p ), 
  yes . 
  because uk is so hostile to an idea of an eu army but a franco-german-italo-spanish army really does n't bother your ministers ? 
  is it because of malta ? 
  does malta frighten you ? 
  i wonder how did they manage to make drool proofs keyboards . 
  because you sound like a person that has the level of intellect that would require one . 
  and they wont be part . 
  heck , the eu was n't planned as having an army . 
  we can start from scratch a new project . 
  a common project between germany and france could dwarf in military might any other european power ( except russia ) . 
  different words have different meanings . 
   if you think hard brexit is painful ( which , by the way , still has n't happened at all and may not happen considering the parliament is against it ) be sure that the uk collapsing would be orders of magnitude worse that has ** zero ** connection to your bs comment that uk wants to be an economic partner . 
   do they have troops in the baltics ? 
  they 're part of nato ... what do you think ? 
  and they love nato . 
   take part in our sanctions against russia ? 
  oh , as us 's lapdog , they love sanctions on russia . 
   take part in operation serval ? 
  * minimal * involvement . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval  share a common stance towards syria ? 
  ah yes . 
  vital example of cooperation amongst nations . 
  uk has consistently been a better partner to the us than to any eu nation .
