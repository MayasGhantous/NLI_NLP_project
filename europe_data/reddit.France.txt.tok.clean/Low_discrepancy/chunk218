  no military personal or war material is sitting on these islands . 
  because you seem quite ignorant of the situation . 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/13/politics/china-military-south-china-sea-report/  . 
  they have created new islands which is illegal . 
  how about the priest that has to dunk a dead baby ? 
  or if it 's a rabbi , he has to grab a dead baby 's penis and trim it . 
  i 'm probably on a list now . 
   they arent taking other peoples islands . 
  kinda of a big difference . 
  they are occupying sea territory that does not belong to them . 
  here 's a map of their requests : http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/18105/production/_90356589_south_china_sea_spratlys.png, 
   how did germany or france handle the ukraine or georgia crisis any better then the us ? 
  is there any war in georgia or ukraine now ? 
   reports at the time show the us was actually very annoyed by the lack of movement by the eu . 
  yeah . 
  easy to ask for other people to do their job quicker . 
  that 's actually one of the easiest things to do . 
  lover ? 
  yeah suuuure . 
  and marion wants to fuck me !, 
  what did the us do for georgia and ukraine ? 
   it took shooting down an airliner filled mostly with eu citizens for the eu to do anything . 
  are people on this thread trying to reach an ignorance quota or something ? 
  i mean your comment does sound ignorant as fuck so it should fill any daily minimum required . 
  can we therefore put more effort and thought before posting the send button ? 
   do n't you get the impression that western europe is happy how it ended ? 
  did you bother linking the article that i posted or should i do some reels < feelz memes . 
   big relief - only not for the people who live there . 
  holy fuck you are ignorant . 
  i 'll leave now cuz i 'm tired of gung ho wanna-be warriors . 
   us provided a lot of military support for ukraine and is still doing it . 
  yeah . 
  he gave a few guns . 
  no skin off his back . 
   stating that our stance towards russia is too agressive . 
  considering that you only consider help as being the militarist kind and that brokering a peace deal ( good or bad it 's still a peace deal ) is something that can be ignored , yeah it 's a tad bit too aggressive . 
  when push comes to shove it 's us europeans that have to make sacrifices ( the economic sanctions affected in their majority europeans and western europeans ) . 
  i do n't see the us asking for chinese economic sanctions in the southern china sea debacle . 
   poland and us who wanted to help . 
  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-08-21/u-s-told-ukraine-to-stand-down-as-putin-invaded but hey i guess that since obama gave 2 stern speeches that means that he 's ready to rumble . 
  i also do n't remember poland being at minsk 2 . 
  well that 's totally a reasoned rational response . 
   let 's face it , that will never happen as long as united states has our back . 
  it could have happened in 91 for you , it did n't . 
  it 's time to let go of the past . 
  brezhnev is dead . 
  dusk ? 
   the second is about their conviction that when the push comes to shove it wo n't be the french or germany who will come to rescue us but the usa . 
  if push comes to shove , the whole of europe is fucked . 
  and let 's face it , that will never happen . 
  if it will be a soft power issue or russia creating problems by proxy , then france and germany are the ones that have to put in their effort and the us will sit back ( as was the case in ukraine or georgia ) . 
   wow , i almost felt for the guy . 
  fuck that dude . 
  who gives a shit about an ignorant guy with a vote . 
  what was more depressing was the voice and tone of the interviewer . 
  he did really sound actually sad and a bit exasperated . 
  even the fact that he was a bit unfair to the interviewee shows his annoyance . 
  he 's put in a situation he does not want to be and he has to make the best that he can out of it . 
  makes me think what would i do if the french were to vote laws that go completely against the type of society i wan na live in like the death penalty or other . 
   much better explanation than the `` terrorism just happens '' favored by french politicians what politicians ? 
  because a significant part complain about muuzzlimz . 
   the reason would be that he participated in the dismantling of a mcdonald 's in 1999 . 
  let 's hope canada never find out about the massive dump i took in one of micky d 's restaurants . 
  neah . 
  me thinks corruption . 
  they immediatly bought from lm . 
  making money for your country is nice . 
  making money for yourself is even nicer . 
   maybe you bullied us to go into libya https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1973 here you go . 
  do you have something similar for iraq ? 
  what did the un say ? 
  the us could have freely vetoed that decision  . 
  thanks . 
  we 're already building our own nukes . 
  we build our own subs . 
  and it 's working pretty well : http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense-news/2016/04/26/france-dcns-submarine-australia-shipbuilding-hollande/83562234/ we feel better not depending on the us . 
  we could tell the us it is a historically bad idea to invade iraq . 
  did canada criticise that manoeuvre ? 
  dude . 
  just admit you 're wrong and stop digging . 
  this is getting ridiculous, 
  you can easily check what the deal was . 
  this is not some bullshit thing where you can lie . 
  yeah.but europe wants to be independent some day . 
  not let the us bully us into going to iraq or russia bullying us in the east, 
   most of these cases is people acting like dicks and then getting into trouble . 
  victim claiming much ? 
  yeah but she 's an annoying person and hollande is said to be quite chill and the joker in private . 
  that deffo factors in . 
  we do n't have that problem in france , 
  well he got royal when he was young and frankly as a young dude he was [ quite attractive ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/images/2013/04/25/hollande-1374482-jpg_1258770.jpg ) . 
  sadly , unlike french wines , he did n't age well . 
  in old age ... powaaa, 
  oh im sure hollande put it in . 
  so if the canadian army needs to buy some planes or whatever , they wont ask bombardier first ? 
  really ? 
  no shit sherlock . 
  how do you define `` best '' ? 
  that 's the problem here . 
   i took a quick look at your comment history thinking you might have been a brit / american you saw that i dread admitting i am wrong even in the face of reasonable arguments so you concluded that i must be a brit/american ?
