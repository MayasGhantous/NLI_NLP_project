  looks like these idiots need to step it down a notch . 
  he no spread anymore lies . 
   til that revolutionary terror is invented by lenin , well ** finally ** , you realise that lenin did create a  corrupt and oppressive system , meaning that your previous comment :  and lenin had n't found corrupt and oppressive system , is utter bull crap . 
   because he had n't founded stalinist institutions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheka https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror have some stuff to read because apparently you did n't pay attention to your history classes . 
  again this is your quote  and lenin had n't found corrupt and oppressive system , own up to it . 
  you were clearly bullshitting to the nth degree . 
   and lenin had n't found corrupt and oppressive system , that 's what you 're saying buddy . 
  how is that not lenin circle jerking ? 
   blaming him for what ussr had became is a bit unfair , is n't it ? 
  lenin made stalin relevant . 
  / u/ghamsilg 's comment read like the usual trotsky circle jerk . 
  comrade , yuo join [ red faction army ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) ? 
  they good communists , fighting imperialist-capitalist pigs . 
  and best thing : yuo get free plane tickets . 
  `` show me proof this russophobia ? 
  there no is proof . '', 
  i do n't know about you man but i 'm not really fond of russian tourists . 
  at all . 
  you ca n't go invade crimea or whatever but by god we 'll mock them . 
  is there photo of saviuor kiril ? 
   a point which / u/low _ discrepancy responded to by downvoting my post , and not responding further . 
  so 8 million come to reddit but i downvoted you ? 
  got ip proof   the classical meaning refers to mass killings with the intent to eradicate a population . 
  there is no classical meaning . 
  unless you mean 1944 to be classical . 
   ofc you can always answer with a question and find a medieval anecdotes based chronicle it 's a chronicle written by someone at the court of bela 3 , a hungarian king . 
   believe in the hungarian and german colonists and other nationalist myths or zombies and vampires , if you like . 
  you disregard your own sources randomly but i have a mentality . 
  okay man . 
  talking to nationalists dumbs me . 
  cheers . 
   ma-tii you need a frenchman to correct your romanian ? 
  also i see you do n't take banter that kindly . 
  thin skinned people all around . 
   i was only pointing out its extremely hard to punish defamation criminally in the us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_defamation_law you have the laws . 
  just write a book calling someone a whore and see if it helps . 
  well you can read the title . 
  honestly i do n't speak serbian . 
  dude we do n't need theories . 
  we have ** hungarian sauces ** : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gesta_hungarorum  based on the extant hungarian chronicles , it is clear that more than one ( occasionally extended ) list existed of the peoples inhabiting the carpathian basin at the time of the hungarian landtaking . 
  [ 112 ] anonymous , for instance , first writes of the `` slavs , bulgarians , vlachs and the shepherds of the romans '' [ 113 ] as inhabiting the territory , [ 114 ] [ 115 ] but later he refers to `` a people called kozar '' [ 116 ] and to the sz\u00e9kelys . 
  [ 112 ] similarly , simon of k\u00e9za ** first lists the `` slavs , greeks , germans , moravians and vlachs '' ** , [ 117 ] [ 118 ] but ** later adds that the sz\u00e9kelys also lived in the territory ** . 
  [ 119 ] transylvania is occupied by slavs , bulgarians and vlachs and later on szekelys . 
  will you argue with your own history ? 
   i expect we can see the number rising and economy tanking harder in france in the upcoming years . 
  if economy tanks it 's not because paul-\u00c9douard and marie-chantal are moving . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  rich people move all over . 
  it 's the industry that counts . 
   but colonist is a strange term because it assumes another state existed there . 
  the closest thing to that is the avar kaganate . 
  well why not consider your own hungarian sauces : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gesta_hungarorum  based on the extant hungarian chronicles , it is clear that more than one ( occasionally extended ) list existed of the peoples inhabiting the carpathian basin at the time of the hungarian landtaking . 
  [ 112 ] anonymous , for instance , first writes of the `` slavs , bulgarians , vlachs and the shepherds of the romans '' [ 113 ] as inhabiting the territory , [ 114 ] [ 115 ] but later he refers to `` a people called kozar '' [ 116 ] and to the sz\u00e9kelys . 
  [ 112 ] similarly , simon of k\u00e9za first lists the `` slavs , greeks , germans , moravians and vlachs '' , [ 117 ] [ 118 ] but later adds that the sz\u00e9kelys also lived in the territory . 
   however hungarian and sz\u00e9kely populations have lived continously in transylvania since the 10th century . 
  yes but : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gesta_hungarorum that 's a cronicle by someone at the court of the hungarian king bela 3 . 
  he was unknown hence refered as anynomous . 
   based on the extant hungarian chronicles , it is clear that more than one ( occasionally extended ) list existed of the peoples inhabiting the carpathian basin at the time of the hungarian landtaking . 
  [ 112 ] anonymous , for instance , first writes of the `` slavs , bulgarians , vlachs and the shepherds of the romans '' [ 113 ] as inhabiting the territory , [ 114 ] [ 115 ] but later he refers to `` a people called kozar '' [ 116 ] and to the sz\u00e9kelys .

  [ 119 ] so you can see that the region was first inhabited by slavs , bulgarians and vlachs and later on they were occupied by szekelys . 
  like it or not they did invade an area that was previously occupied . 
   i also highly doubt that the `` inherent literacy rate '' in 895 affected the literacy rate in 1930 . 
  lets take your sauce : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons  along with the ( largely hungarian ) transylvanian nobility and the szeklers , the transylvanian saxons were members of the unio trium nationum , or `` union of the three nations '' , ** signed in 1438 . 
  ** this agreement preserved political rights for the three inclusive groups and ** excluded the largely romanian peasantry from political life . 
  **  on a semi-related note , would you call someone born in the usa today , what would you call a population that occupates a region and exclude the occupied people from any political process ? 
  but let 's talk about the literacy rate in 1930 . 
  maybe it is due to the fact that the hungarians engaged into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization  the number of minority-language schools was steadily decreasing : in the period between 1880 and 1913 , when the number of hungarian-only schools almost doubled , the number of minority language-schools almost halved & nbsp ;  the process of magyarization culminated in 1907 with the lex apponyi ( named after education minister albert apponyi ) which ** forced all primary school children to read , write and count in hungarian for the first four years of their education . 
  ** from 1909 religion also had to be taught in hungarian & nbsp ;  approximately 600 romanian villages were depleted of proper schooling due to the laws . 
  what would you call when a minority of people grab power and do n't let the majority participate in politics ? 
  when a minority decides what language the majority should learn to speak ? 
  i 'm confused ... 
   refuses to accept impoverishment , ** haha ** they 'll continue to be poor . 
  unemployment does n't produce wealth  other forms of atypical employment so they 'll force people to hire them ? 
  that 's not a thing ... 
  exactly . 
  let 's look : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons  the colonization of transylvania by germans was begun by king g\u00e9za ii of hungary ( 1141 -- 1162 ) . 
  for decades , the main task of the german settlers was to defend the southeastern border of the kingdom of hungary . 
  the colonization continued until the end of the 13th century . 
  and  along with the ( largely hungarian ) transylvanian nobility and the szeklers , the transylvanian saxons were members of the unio trium nationum , or `` union of the three nations '' , signed in 1438 . 
  this agreement preserved political rights for the three inclusive groups and excluded the largely romanian peasantry from political life . 
  it must not come as a surprise to you that the romanias had almost 0 political power and the hungarian and german minorities were the ruling class that received several benefits . 
   that 's the stupidest bullshit i 've read in a while hungarian confirmed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvanian_saxons  the colonization of transylvania by germans was begun by king g\u00e9za ii of hungary ( 1141 -- 1162 ) . 
  for decades , the main task of the german settlers was to defend the southeastern border of the kingdom of hungary . 
  the colonization continued until the end of the 13th century . 
  here you go some sauce . 
   transylvania stronk , very powerful , many literate !!! 1 !! 11 !, 
  in regions occupied by hungarians or germanics . 
  crisana had a hungarian majority back in the day . 
  i trained you well . 
  monkey see monkey do , 
  now do n't be salty because you posted bs stuff ... 
  [ work kills ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/proletarianrage/status/715524061795901440/photo/1 ) ah so fun paying taxes and social dues to prop people like that ... 
  well their results have already been debated in the wiki article you just posted . 
  i simply mentioned it because people do n't read sauces , they just read comments . 
  you included apparently . 
  in other countries , communist regimes saw people just as means of production . 
  they did n't hesitate to ban abortion in romania simply to make more babies .
