  i have no idea what star system you 're talking about but yes there are some great chefs out there from all countries . 
  those that make these expensive restaurants tend to actually know their crap . 
  they only have a finite amount of place on their menu so their really spend time researching what their propose . 
  if they propose foods from other countries , they usually have spent time in that country . 
  they do n't wake up one day and say : `` oh i think i 'll make this new foreign recipe i just heard of , from a country i 've never been to , with ingredients that are all mixed up and i 'll charge 200 euros for it '' . 
  that 'll definitely go down ok , right ? 
  there was another country that announced in french and i 'm pretty sure other languages . 
  i tend to not pay too much attention cuz i do n't have a chip on my shoulder * shrug * . 
  i 'd rather hear a beautiful foreign accent at ** euro ** vision than a botched up english one . 
  but that 's just me , i like diversity , 
   food gets changed all the freakin time read my comment again because you went into outrage mode without taking the time to friggin read . 
  here , i 'll put it in bold extra large for you . 
  ** we 're talking about ** #big chefs . 
  pizza hut and your other examples is n't the type of restaurant you go to pay 150 euros for a dish . 
   as was cooked before world war never had macarons where we took an old recipe and made it differently . 
   why are mediterranean food cultures always so conservative ? 
  why are people who are great at something so keen on not having that something ruined ? 
  why are people who are great at something really fond of that particular something ? 
  foods have a tradition , a history and are a heritage . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33542392 read this when a brit orders a marinara with mozzarella . 
  of course he does n't realise that marinara are pizzas that were originally meant for sailors who did not have money for cheese on they pizza . 
  that 's a deep historical tie that might seem ridiculous and trivial but i find it very interesting . 
  in this case it 's a major chef that fucks up . 
  if you 're a big chef , you should have a deep understanding for the historical aspects of a recipe or food item . 
  it 's not just food , it 's your career , you 're a friggin artisan , show some quality work ffs . 
   this is what tv chefs do all the time , whether they 're from a country , or not . 
  our chefs usually `` revisit '' our cuisine ( in shows like master chef or top chef ) . 
  the only foreign dish i 've seen redone was the hamburger and fries ... but i doubt anyone would care so deeply about the micky d staple . 
  there are restaurants that redo japanese or chinese or other items . 
  but it 's usually after the chef has spent a significant amount of time in those countries . 
  has oliver spent some time in spain ? 
  if you and me mess up or modify a foreign food that 's okay . 
  who gives a crap . 
  but when a big chef does it , i dunno . 
  it 's like lamborghini starting to do knock off ferraris . 
  you 'd be a bit wtf ? 
  he 's an artisan , you expect higher quality workmanship . 
  a brit trying to cook paella and thus offending the spanish ? 
  [ life imitating art ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_anniversary_ ( fawlty_towers \\ ) ), 
   the song contest is entirely occupied by the english language . 
  yes . 
  that 's a shame . 
  art does not exist exclusively in one language you know . 
  louis armstrong singing la vie en rose is simply not as powerful . 
  neunundneunzig luftballons in english is not as hard hitting as in german even though it 's the same song sang by the same people and i do n't speak german . 
  he 's delivering the crepes . 
  not the french . 
  everybody loves us !, 
  ( except when they throw the terrorist attacks in our face \u00e0 la `` stfu , you had a terrorist attack , go mind your muslims '' . ), 
   there are more french arabs and muslims in the french army and police forces then there are jews , by the way . 
  than jews in total ? 
  are you smoking ? 
  if so , there are 500k jewish in france . 
  and about 4 millions muslims . 
  for there to be more muslims in the police and military , that would mean that 1 in 8 muslims would be a policeman or a soldier . 
  lol . 
   muslims in france ? 
  http://fr.reuters.com/article/topnews/idfrkcn11o0a1?pagenumber=2&amp;virtualbrandchannel=0 29 % think that sharia is more important than the laws of the french republic . 
  that 's a fuckton of people . 
   no sympathy for palestinian-hating , rabidly pro-israel jews in france !, 
  but sympathy for the `` young frenchmen '' that went to syria to commit genocide ? 
  about 1500 of them . 
   socialists are stupid ? 
  how do you offend socialists ? 
  do you throw money at their union hq ? 
  that 's the jewish . 
  i 'll post his the comments to your previous message because you 're the type of troll that deletes their messages . 
   so would you see this as being as funny if it was a couple of drunk guys throwing bacon at a synagogue ? 
  it would be awkward and kinda shitty but in the end ... it 's just foodstuff thrown at buildings . 
  if there is damage , you just fine them for loitering and move on . 
  having your dog shitting on the side walk and not cleaning up is way worse . 
   or would it be `` muh jews in europe under threat '' ? 
  out of ** 7 ** major terrorist attacks that happened recently in europe : brievik , merah , nemmouche , ch+s uperkacher , paris attacks , brussels attacks , nice , ** 3 ** explicitely targeted jews . 
  for france that 's ** 2 ** terrorist attacks out of ** 4 ** . 
  merah attacked a jewish school . 
  he grabbed a 8 yo girl by her hair and fucking ** headshot her ** . 
  he also killed a 3 and a 5 yo kid . 
  only ** 0.83 % ** of french are jewish yet ** 50 % ** of attacks targetted them . 
  you have to be mentally retarded to think they 're not under threat . 
  the video says that the bunkers were imposed by law . 
  we need more info before we circlejerk . 
  the russian doll of churches . 
  at sea level then ? 
  united kingdom investment partnership ? 
  ouch that really hit me hard in the head : /, 
  what 's the level the gdp will settle at in case of a hard brexit ? 
   the killing in gladio was done by europeans mostly funded by the cia . 
   you might be right there , but the fact that eurozone is not an optimal currency area does n't imply italy and others leaving . 
  no , but i honestly believe that the eurozone in its current form wont be here in 20 years . 
   so to sum it up : i claim that mr. stiglitz 's prediction about future , smart as he is , is no better than a coin toss . 
  he has arguments on why the euro is bad . 
  there are arguments on why the eu is good but on the long term things will worsen . 
  countries not in the euro can quickly bounce back : romania , iceland . 
  countries in the eu : portugal , italy are not bouncing back . 
  only ireland did well but that 's because of how their specific situation . 
   unless they have actual scientific proof . 
  the `` scientific '' proof is the fact that the eurozone is not an optimal currency area so you have to prop it up . 
  that 's the truth . 
  there 's no point in ignoring it and say everything 's perfect . 
  it 's not .
