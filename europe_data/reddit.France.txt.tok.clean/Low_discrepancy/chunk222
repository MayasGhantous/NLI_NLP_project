  if you decide to spend 2.5 billion , you should provide more than that . 
  it 's still 5 euros out of every european 's pocket ( but of course since germany and france contribute vastly more to the eu budget while countries like poland or romania have positive net it means that western europeans will pay more ) . 
  my bad . 
  i tend to not memorise comments . 
   get people exposed to another culture . 
  and what is the price that you 're willing to pay for such exposition ? 
  why not give every european a free train ticket to anywhere on this globe ? 
   you understand that commissioning a submarine means placing it in active service ? 
  yeah and the first vanguard started service in 1993 not 1999 like you said . 
   with no enemy of comparable naval capacity anywhere in sight was it not perhaps wiser to wait until 2030 to spend 30 or so billion ? 
  nuclear subs have little to do with a navy . 
  you wo n't nuke other subs or whatever . 
  they 're part of your protection mechanism making sure you do n't get bombed . 
   wait until 2030 to spend 30 or so billion ? 
  like i said no . 
  if you start the program in 2030 , you 'll need 10-15 years to put the first sub to work . 
  that 's 45 years between the commissioning . 
  considering that the average expert has about 40 years of work life , the people that would build your new subs would have never worked on a submarine ** in their lives ** . 
  that is a very bad idea . 
  knowledge is lost . 
  but beneficial to what purpose ? 
  what do you want to achieve ? 
   which is really not significant compared to benefits . 
  what benefits ? 
  if you wan na `` rekindle enthusiasm for the european union '' does that mean that the pass should go exclusively towards french , czech or greek youth and not towards polish or romanian that are massively in favor of the eu ? 
  now i wish i had n't . 
  it sounds more and more stupid . 
  a lottery ? 
  the 2.5 b might not be a low ball ( though who knows ) , the train system suddenly getting 5 million users is n't a good idea . 
   heck , $ 150 is already a third of the price of the interrail ticket - and that 's just one trip !, 
  holy fuck !, 
  i hope they 'll axe this stupid project then . 
  this would cost us way too much . 
  2.5 billion is just a low ball ( or probably assuming the vast majority wo n't use the system ) . 
   the previous version of the subs was not keeping us safe ? 
  innovate or die . 
  you can use wooden submarines , but they wo n't stand much of a challenge . 
  in 50 years , your current submarines will be way too old . 
  not to mention the most important aspect of them all : know how . 
  you will lose the capability of build good quality subs if you stop building for 50 years as everybody went to retirement . 
   the last sub of the previous vanguard class was commissioned in 1999 . holy crap . 
  so you guys had the vanguard class before you commissioned it ? 
  : o guys i think the brits have invented a time machine . 
  why do n't you google a bit how these things work , ey ? 
  the first one started service in 1993 , it was ordered in 1982 . 
  the last one started service in 1999 . 
  they 'll be decommissioned by 2030 . 
  that 's a lifetime of 30-35 years ( originally they were planned for 25 years ) . 
   if not being able to perfectly predict the future means incompetency to you just check the past , to see how great revolutions were . 
   including you i tend to not try to predict the future   many people in east germany don \u00b4 t live as well . 
  impossible !, 
  they had socialism . 
  stop your lies !, 
   the transition between socialism and capitalism was brutal there . 
  because before 89 , they were living a wonderful life . 
  how many were shot trying to leave and how many were shot trying to enter gdr ? 
  usually when you 're having such an awesome life , you do n't build walls to keep people in . 
  okay i 'm done talking to angsty teenagers . 
  have a nice day . 
  cheers , 
   he couldn \u00b4 t predict that capitalism would adapt and react yeah . 
  check my incompetence remark   it seems that the capitalist system slowly tries to revert some of these reforms . 
  i live very well . 
  you as a german are living very well . 
  look at former soviet countries ... not so well . 
   i already told you , his conclusion was that they were inevitable . 
  yeah . 
  check my incompetence remark , 
   pointless to discuss if you are biased against something you don \u00b4 t know anything about . 
  true . 
  you got ta believe in communism for it to make sense to you . 
  it takes a special brain for it , 
   due to gas prices road trips get quite expensive you can take the bus for super cheap in europe . 
  from zagreb to paris , 150 euros that 's dirt cheap and under what hostels would cost , or camping + food + some drinks etc etc. 
  sorry , but i think giving free trains is just a useless thing that costs too much . 
  my point is that your comparison is illogical , yes . 
  i 'd rather give our youth from the banlieues the means to actually go outside for a week or two and visit some place or another in france . 
  got friends that have never been in a tgv at their mid 20s . 
  or visiting friggin louvre from meaux is like a special trip for youngsters . 
  wtf ? 
   nuclear submarines yeah but those avoid us getting nuked or invaded . 
  has anyone dared to invade israel or north korea ? 
   i think it is not crazy to dedicate monuments to the victims of spanish imperialism in spain . 
  actually the equivalent is having memorial ** where ** the atrocity happened . 
  hiroshima happened in japan , 9/11 in the us and the holocaust in germany . 
  so / u/ibmthink was bullshitting in how marx had nothing to do with the violence that his idiotic theories proposed . 
   you forget the part were the capitalism destroy itself . 
  is that before or after the second coming of christ ? 
  cuz that 's a theory too . 
   he was born in 1818 , in his youth , there had been multiple revolutions or attempts at revolutions . 
  and his conclusion from all was that revolutions were awesome and we should have more ? 
  in the best of cases that 's incompetence and stupidity , in the worst malevolence . 
  none speak well for him . 
   back when he was around , capitalism was still in its infancy state , which means the workers had basically no rights and were oppressed . 
  the vast majority of countries managed to achieve much better conditions without communism . 
  uhm , that 's what we 're doing in france . 
   microsoft before the church they should build those minecraft cathedrals irl :p, 
  marx didn \u00b4 t do any of this . 
  i do n't know jack about marx but was n't he in favor of a proleratian revolution ? 
  in a country that has rule of law , you can not pass from capitalism to communism because any normal country guarantees the right to private property .
