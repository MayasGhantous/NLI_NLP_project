  so we can say that marx was in favor of violent rebellions . 
  ( ca n't really convince people to give up what they have , without threats ) . 
  i ca n't believe someone would produce such a retarded comparison . 
  one guy for good or bad , incompetence or not brought a ton of new knowledge to the world . 
  the other was just a king with a private domain . 
  compare leopold ii with isabela i if you want . 
  it would make for a less ridiculous claim . 
   hiroshima not to criticise your comment , but do you have any hiroshima memorials in spain ? 
  i wonder how many there are in the us . 
  how about scrapping everything and putting just a list of facts people can read about ? 
  [ yes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/us_%2420_series_2006_obverse.jpg/1280px-us_%2420_series_2006_obverse.jpg ), 
   indian engineer working for peanuts will take your job depends on the type of job you 're having . 
  if you 're working on critical systems that can not be easily outsourced without risking leaks of your code base , knowhow etc. 
  then you 'll have a safe job that 'll last you for a long long time . 
   celebrating the results of protectionism to me go read how yahoo was scanning emails for the us govt !, 
  you simply refuse the perfectly clear point / u/mrzakalwe is making . 
  he 'd rather be poorer in the next 30 years but have an uncertain future , than be richer in the next 30 years but have an uncertain future . 
  that makes perfect sense to me !, 
  guy hates money . 
   in this case unless you have a gift for prophesy , time will tell or if you listen to the experts , everybody will be poorer . 
  http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_429ihjqvpbv1cnb congrats uk , you won the stupid lottery . 
  yeah . 
  right ear did n't work . 
  try to play around with the jack . 
  i notice bills tend to have names that are the opposite of what they actually strive to achieve : * patriot act * the internet freedom act * clear skies act and quite a few more . 
  hey ... you can enjoy his art even though he 's a jackass . 
  just pirate it , 
  kassovitz is a 9/11 truther so it 's no secret he 's a shitbag . 
   no we really do n't . 
  did you go check the poll that i already sent you ? 
   without knowing what the outcome of the negotiations will be yeah it 'll be really mitigated if uk remains in the eea i.e. 
  being in the eu without any veto vote . 
  that sound very smart . 
  and looking at the rhetoric presented so far , it 's pretty clear that some actually want a hard brexit which is dumb . 
   for example , you 'd be hard pressed to find a majority in the uk who would exchange say the nhs for a 1 % boost in gdp you having the nhs ** has ** an impact on gdp . 
  immigrants ** have ** an impact on gdp , [ a positive one ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study ) . 
  friggin `` self determination '' has no real impact on gdp because it 's just plain words . 
  it 's a hollow concept anyone can fill it up with whatever fantasies they have . 
   who would want to exchange a reversion to monarchy for a 1 % rise in gdp no one would want that because that 's ** bullshit ** . 
  there is no economic leaver that a monarchy would have to produce higher gdp . 
  you are inventing stuff . 
   its not all about the economy , there are societal political and other aspects too . . no ... it 's bullshit . 
  the arguments you are giving about `` self-determination '' and whatever crap are bullshit . 
  you create this imaginary all powerful being called the eu then you rebel against it because it has waay too much power . 
  no , the eu does n't impede on uk self determination . 
   i do n't think we 'll see any significant economic harm either way , and quite a lot of potential . 
  no significant economic harm , just that people will be poorer because of bullshit . 
  you put yourself in the situation where you console yourself with the fact that `` hey guys , it wo n't be ** that ** bad '' . 
  which in my opinion is stupid but hey , if you think that 's awesome , more power to you . 
  cheers . 
  we should test that theory by posting a bs article that would n't get any upvotes normally . 
   they do , but that 's taking one point in isolation ( the economic aspect . . ) well of course . 
  is that not the most important aspect about the brexit ? 
  you can argue till the cows come home if politically it 's useful of not , but economically we already know what 's the most likely outcome : everybody will be poorer . 
   but hey , some things that some people think are important will be different . 
  hey we got the message , you 'd rather be poorer and not `` depend on brussels '' . 
  whatever that bullshit means . 
  when people let politics determine how much money they get in the end , something is just off . 
   it 'll get worse , but not drastically so what i 'm confused about is why ? 
  why make yourself and others poorer ? 
  it 's a bit like checking your weather outside during a few days and concluding climate change is happening ( or not ) . 
  there are way to many unknowns to figure out the exact long term effects of brexit . 
  but economists vastly agree that brexit will make uk and eu citizens poorer . 
  http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_429ihjqvpbv1cnb they vastly agree on this topic . 
  so yeah , brexit was dumb . 
   also there are probably more brits on r/the _ donald than americans . 
  a new [ david farnsworth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_farnsworth ) ? 
  zero hedge is often bs so i 'll take that with a pinch of salt . 
  where 's my sand shovel when i need it ? 
  new offering in the train restaurant : boar carpaccio, 
   what they did is so beyond the pale that they should be banned from doing business in the us whatsoever . 
  so gm should be banned from doing business in the us for killing 125 people ? 
  there it is again !, 
  i 'm seeing it everywhere now . 
  am i the only one seeing it ? 
   they were wanted terrorists before they committed an act of terror ? 
  that 's some minority report level of policing . 
  they left to a warzone while being radical islamists . 
  there are quite a few people over there committing genocides . 
  what 's with the dot under the a ? 
  go ginger or go home !, 
   america is not a ` white nation ' nor was it ever supposed to be one eh , benji franklin would like to have a word with you :  that the number of purely white people in the world is proportionably very small . 
  all africa is black or tawny . 
  america ( exclusive of the new comers ) wholly so . 
  and in europe , the spaniards , italians , french , russians and swedes , are generally of what we call a swarthy complexion ; as are the germans also , the saxons only excepted , who with the english , make the principal body of white people on the face of the earth . 
  i could wish their numbers were increased . 
  and while we are , as i may call it , scouring our planet , by clearing america of woods , and so making this side of our globe reflect a brighter light to the eyes of inhabitants in mars or venus , why should we in the sight of superior beings , darken its people ? 
  why increase the sons of africa , by planting them in america , where we have so fair an opportunity , by excluding all blacks and tawneys , of increasing the lovely white and red ? 
  but perhaps i am partial to the complexion of my country , for such kind of partiality is natural to mankind . 
  not to mention the way elections and power was organised from the beginning with the senat that had a lot of power and where the positions were occupied by white males . 
  claiming that the founding fathers did n't want the us to remain organised around white males is very sketchy . 
   all 9 attackers were eu citizens . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34832512 ** bullshit ** . 
  ahmad al mohammad and al mahmod were two suicide bombers that had fake syrian passports and we assume that they 're syrians or irakis because we do n't know their identity . 
  but hey i appreciate the balls to `` correct '' people who actually got this crap posted on tv 24/7 for a couple of weeks . 
  good job on being clueless . 
   none of the paris attackers were actual refugees . 
  2 out of the 9 were . 
  in france , the largest circle that has no human settlements in it has a diameter of 20 km . 
  since how italy has a higher density , i doubt th\u00e9 situation is much diff\u00e9rent .
