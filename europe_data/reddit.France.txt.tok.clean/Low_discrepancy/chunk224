  read on bbc that the pope got stood up in georgia, 
   very xenophobic how is the burqa banning xenophobic ? 
   european left merkel is a well known leftist . 
  numerical simulations in fluid mechanics is notoriously difficult . 
  there are actually few known fundamental mathematical results ( we do n't even know is there exists a solution to navier stokes ) , so this means the whole field lacks elegance . 
  the mathematics are ugly , the physics is ugly . 
  electric bikes tend to cost as much as a small scooter . 
  that 's why you have sevici , with a very dense network of bike rentals where you can drop it easily . 
  i mean who sa\u00efd we want \u00e0 decentralised system ? 
   if you do not want a federal system who said we dont ? 
  let 's ignore the past because eastern europe is so much better now . 
  btw go read what people think of the gypsies . 
  i mean you need to prepare 10 years in advance to build it . 
  it 's not like romania 's gdp would have taken a sharp dive in 95 if they had built it then . 
   to become even more alienated from society . 
  i disagree . 
  we 've had articles about women having to move to morocco or whatever in order to live their faith as they see . 
  clearly they are much more integrated in society now . 
  a different society but a society nonetheless . 
   but it is one of the largest and that is probably enough . 
  so how many banks need bail-out and for how long ? 
  if db is nationalised , it should also be required to be chopped up . 
   has everyone already forgotten 2008 ? 
  everybody had their hands in the us subprime morgage jar back then , that 's why everybody suffered . 
  now ... meh . 
  sure it 's big , but wo n't be that big . 
   i am really puzzled why people here seem to want to see deutsche collapse so badly . 
  because 8 years after that crisis , we still have a lot of zombie banks that should be hacked off . 
  db is one of them , chop it up like dexia . 
  til db doing shitty business is eu 's fault . 
  uk news must be something else . 
  dude , property in * central * dresden was dirt cheap after that . 
  sure it was a bit of a fixer upper , but you ca n't beat that beautiful sky ceiling . 
  how low can you go [ before this happens ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yf6phns.jpg ), 
  * lem me put my moralising cap on * god , why are the germans investing in so many shaddy deals ? 
  i guess it 's up to us french and other eurozone people to teach them how to invest wisely and stop chasing bad deals , throwing good money after bad money , etc. 
  clearly the germans do n't know how to handle money . 
  can the swiss ( except ubs ) help them ? 
  such risk takers . 
  tsk tsk tsk . 
   if deutche goes under , the euro is kaput . 
  it 's not the largest euro bank by market cap or by assets . 
  it 's just the largest one by the number of bs deals . 
  so why ? 
   western europe that 's not the only part of europe , is it ? 
  uhm ? 
  who would the 28th ? 
  the us ? 
   that fascism took over romania through a coup did antonescu personally kill all those jewish and gypsies ? 
  or did authorities , the army and the police have a heavy hand in what was happening ? 
  if tomorrow the police and the army start killing 300k civilians , i assume that there would be a riot you know , a rebellion . 
   romania lost 370,000 soldiers well they also killed about 20k gypsies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porajmos and 270k jewish http://www.annefrankguide.net/en-us/bronnenbank.asp?oid=20747 that 290k ** civilians ** , romanian citizens that romania killed . 
  i think it 's better if we prioritise them instead . 
  paging / u/matttk and his  we do n't do anything differently like it or not romanians have a hard time admitting guilt . 
  history and horrors are always something that happen to them , they never caused nothing . 
  that 's why the main focus is the crimes of communism , while the holocaust of jewish only got some attention since 2005 . 
  gypsies ( even though they suffered a great deal of deportations and genocide ) can go fuck themselves . 
  thieving bastards . 
   socio-economical situation was n't exactly favorable . 
  seems to me it was exactly what you said . 
  27 i excluded uk . 
   you 're acting like if we build a big enough and expensive enough monument , it will bring back to life all the jews that died in the holocaust . 
  again , i did ** not ** mention cost . 
  it was people like / u/nonamenoglory , / u/coolanteater that said that romania could n't build any memorials or museums cuz it 's too expensive . 
  and i replied by giving examples * a ) monuments that did n't cost a ton but still took ** 20 ** years to build . 
  * b ) public buildings that cost a fuckton and were planned and build waaay before any monument or museum . 
   isten , museums and memorials do n't just happen out of thin air . 
  holy fuck . 
  do you or / u/coolanteater think museums or friggin memorials costs hundreds of millions of euros or something ? 
  look at how shitty the [ iasi pogrom memorial is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victims_of_ia%c8%99i_pogrom_monument#/media/file:ia%c8%99i_pogrom_monument_1.jpg ) . 
  that 's cheap as fuck . 
  meanwhile look at that shiny new ** 250 million ** euro [ stadium in bucharest ] ( http://www.revistaconstructiilor.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/arena_nationala.png ) that started in 2007 and ended in 2013 . 
  if you can find 250 million to build a stadium , you can find money to build a friggn museum . 
  it 's okay because the romas were not affected by the holocaust . 
  right guys ? 
  bug never happened right ? 
  there is n't a ton of soft power that can influence russia unlike any other european country that can be influenced either by russia or mainly by the us . 
  hardly any part of the country that actually counts politically , culturally , etc. 
  and big i mean as in military might . 
  about friggin time . 
  one of the largest pogroms in history took place at iasi ( 29 june 1941 , some 13000 jews killed ) and it took romania until 2011 to build a memorial . 
  ok , communism and what not , but between 1990 and 2011 , 21 years passed . 
  you 'd think they 'd come round to it faster . 
  romania 's recognition of the holocaust only came until 2004ish . 
  russia is european . 
  it 's just that russia is one of the old empires ( ottoman , austro-hungarian , french , british , prussian ) that actually survived , hence why they seem different ( they 're not the average european country : soo small that they do n't actually count on global matters by themselves ) . 
  why did you forget countries like chile . 
   `` privacy and cryptography are a problem , we must spy on everyone for their own protection '' the people that actually care about this issue tend to not vote for right wing parties either way . 
  nor is sarkozy a maniac or marine le pen . 
  sarkozy is a ruthless politician and mlp is an ideologue . 
  they are still off putting . 
  you had crazies in power before it was cool : harper ? 
  wtf ? 
  eu is formed by 27 states with very diverse interests that can and do diverge . 
  france recognised the armenian genocide since 2006 aka 10 years ago when erdo\u011fan was still popular https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_recognition#position_of_france here is sarkozy in 2009 , ** 3 years ** before the elections telling obama ( who supported turkey 's bid ) that turkey would destroy the eu . 
  so / u/drunkfootballer is wrong . 
  this is one of the issues sarkozy has been consistent on . 
   would be bigger between male gay couples than heterosexual ones why ? 
  that makes no sense knowing that domestic abuse still tends to be fairly rare and gay couples even rarer .
