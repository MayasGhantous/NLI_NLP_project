  but them you 'll have people like [ nambla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhcjgx3ks5u ) that wan na lower the age of consent to 12 or something like that . 
  and what if you find a 15 yo boy that wants to engage in relations with a mature man . 
  if they both agree with it , who are we to  to change your civil rights . 
  because it would be  tyranny of the majority and you have people like meiwes that found another person that agreed to be killed and devoured . 
  who are we to restrain their civil rights . 
  or people that wan na sell their organs . 
  who are we , or even the supreme court of the us to restrain the rights ? 
  down with the majority . 
  except that kouachi 's never declared themselves from isis . 
  i 'm no expert by any stretch of the imagination but for me taking a gun from bosnia/slovakia/macedonia to syria only to smuggle it in europe through probably greece makes little sense . 
  these guns were bought in belgium from long time smuggling rings . 
  but then again , what do i know ? 
  paca :p, 
  i am confused . 
  what part do you find ridiculous . 
  i voted for a president and a parlament . 
  politicians that put their career on the line for the project of legalising gay marriage . 
  i took part very directly in this major decision of my country . 
  americans do n't work like that and looking by the fact that in arkansas homosexuality was illegal ** even in 2003 ** it is safe to assume that gay marriage wouldnt have happened this decade over there . 
  to each their own , but regardless of the decision i 'd rather be part of it than have someone else decide for me ... you know ... democracy . 
  trying to pretend that americans , even in arkansas are super progressive ( and much more than germans ) , like / u/tom _ turbine is trying , is laughable . 
  hey , you guys should do it too . 
  if you eat fewer wieners , the sausage in your pants will look bigger . 
  dont you wan na strut that bad boy ? 
   you had to go back 159 years to find your `` gotcha '' case . 
  oh you wan na play that game ? 
  fine  [ bush v gore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bush_v._gore ) stopping to recount . 
  [ citizens united v fec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_united_v._fec ) companies are people so they can spend spend spend in elections  ) ) ) and of course it 's hard to critique the system because the us simply is not mature enough to handle its own destiny . 
  until 2003 , homosexuality was illegal in 13 states . 
  in civil right countries , it is the people , through their elected parliaments that decide which way the country is going . 
  in the us it 's 9 people that have no accountability whatsoever , who depending on their mood and tastes , get to decide all your major decisions . 
  while you can say it 's a wonderful system because ~ ~ a country should n't be run by elected officials ~ ~ they 're all level headed people , you still have amazing nuggets like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dred_scott_v._sandford like it , or not . 
  if congress ( or state bodies ) would have had to decide on gay marriages , you would have never had gay marriages in arkansas because politically such a decision is poison over there . 
  tl ; dr : you 're not more progressive , you simply did n't get to have a voice in how your country is run . 
  no no , i said vacation not hiding their money . 
  honest mistake . 
  ( except the cote d'azur ) malaga , marbella , ibiza , etc, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zulzpepuhd8 ), 
  ask your rich russian tycoons where they go vacationing and why . 
  there are no cache of weapons from that period in we . 
  [ ch attackers got their aks from bosnia ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11351855/how-did-the-paris-terrorists-get-hold-of-their-weapons.html ) . 
  the ones from the paris attacks are also from that area and also from [ slovakia with some amo from bosnia ] ( http://time.com/how-europes-terrorists-get-their-guns/ ) . 
  apparently the thalys attacker also got his ak from slovakia ( a quick google on wsj can find the article ) . 
  i still do n't know about reda kriket 's arsenal . 
  i have a follower . 
  want my autograph ? 
   mr putin 's backing for bosnian serb separatism is part of his strategy of sowing chaos in the eu to be fair , bosnia is a clusterfuck . 
  how many of the aks used by those islamic terrorists came from bosnia ? 
  of course . 
  we wear speedos here . 
  none of that puritanism here , 
   we were n't under russia 's sphere of influence uhm no you were n't . 
  that 's why romania condemned the 68 invasion of czechoslovakia and said that told people to take arms if any similar event would happen in romania . 
  and nixon also visited romania and ceausescu would regularly visit weurope countries like uk or france . 
  or ceausescu condemning the soviet invasion of afghanistan . 
  honestly man , what do they teach in schools nowadays if you come out thinking the ussr had any saying in romania was ruled during ceausescu 's time . 
   considering my argument was that too much socialism your argument makes no sense . 
  socialism implies very specific things like state control of means of production , state controlled prices etc. 
  none of those things happen in france . 
  there is no half and half socialism . 
  you do n't control prices on monday , wednesday and friday and let them float on tuesday and thursday . 
  heck romania has more control on its currency ( thus influencing exports and imports ) than france has control of the euro . 
   you insist on doing all of those things yourselves instead of liberalizing your market a little more . 
  you do ** not ** liberalise the defence market . 
  that 's why we do n't depend on the us for protection unlike romania and that 's why we did n't send our soldiers to die in irak , again unlike romania . 
  we also do n't depend on other countries to protect our poor . 
  how many french gypsies have you heard moving to romania ? 
  but there are a fuckton of romanian gypsies in france . 
  did we have salt water taffy for dessert today  got a bit stuck between your teeth ? 
   jmlp got 20 % of the vote ( with 2 candidates ) . 
  i 'll laugh and laugh when your trumpet will get more than that with 4 candidates on the ballot :d, 
  well you claim that  frankfurt is below montreal so you must really trust this z/yen group man . 
  then again you 're from a country were trump is the second likely guy to be president . 
  so putting a fuck ton of faith in stuff you have no clue is probably a long time tradition :d, 
   you were n't under russia 's boot for 50 years either yeah ceausescu was under russia 's boot . 
  what do they teach you in schools man ? 
  did all the teachers leave too ? 
  great job at liberalisation . 
   romania was socialist for 50 years and is so much behind the west only proves my point because france is socialist . 
  goddamn man , did you have ** one ** economics class at least ? 
   ranked between cayman islands and casablanca can someone please tell em what the z/yen group is and why their index is so importatn ? 
  if you can tell me what z/yen group is , ill believe you . 
   the index was created by the z/yen group for the city of london . 
  it 's a bs poll  the index was created by the z/yen group for the city of london . 
  what the fuck is the z/yen group ? 
   uk advocating increased free trade that 's why the uk left the largest single market ? 
  wow : o, 
   which are all signs that you 're more on the socialist side than liberal . 
  liberal like romania 's crony capitalism ? 
  liberal with a crippled social services system that has seen romania lose 1/3rd of its doctors since joining the eu . 
  liberal like romania that build 100 km of highway in 10 years ? 
  i 'd rather pass on all those things , thank you very much . 
   you insist on doing all of those things yourselves instead of liberalizing your market a little more . 
  ah yes . 
  privatization was suuuuch a yuuuge success ( ignoring renault and dacia of course , without it you 'd still be driving 1310 aka renault 14s , you were making them until 2004 ) . 
  tell us more about how successful romania 's defense industry is ? 
  still flying those mig 21 lancer that fly from the sky ? 
  still begging the us for protection ? 
  france is the most independent country in europe ( bar russia of course ) . 
  and one of the most successful heavy arms sellers .
