  so i 'd keep the advice giving if i were you , 
  perception means very little nowadays . 
  people have a negative perception of sarkozy and mlp yet here we are :p . 
  did n't you invade iran and remove their democratically elected leader and put a dictator in place so bp can do business ? 
  how 's that not protectionism to the worst possible level ? 
  neah i 'm thinking about the staunch cultural appropriation of alexander the great for example :p, 
  coming from a greek , that 's funny :d, 
  i misremembered . 
   but i wont lie i 'd rather be in nice if you ever wan na search for a job in that area , try looking at sophia antipolis . 
  quite a few tech companies ... 
  afterwards it 's luck of the draw :p, 
  3k gross in czech rep is a competitive salary for someone that just graduated from a french uni . 
  i could see why some would choose that path . 
  i guess more do n't follow because the language probably . 
  and also the level of skills . 
  a lot of french uni students do n't know how to code well :p, 
  net and starting salary as in off the bench of our engineering school at 23 . 
  quickly climbs higher like i said . 
   make things even harder for business some of the largest business hail from france . 
   oh , and strike private sector almost never strikes . 
   what do you consider low ? 
  depends on the level of education and work area . 
  median entry salary for an engineering student ( at my school ) is 2.5 k monthly . 
  2.8 including extra stuff . 
  after the 2nd year 2.5 k and about ~ 3.2 k with the extra . 
  all of this while benefitting from good health protection and other benefits of living in france . 
  of course i 'm a phd so no way i 'm reaching that levels :d but my friends yeah . 
  a lot i assume has to do with the fact that , for a small country , we make our own nuclear energy , our own nukes , our own nuclear subs , our own fighter planes ( though technically dassault is a private company ) . 
  also health industry ... 
   france has a long history of protectionism . 
  is any country a stranger to that ? 
  the us , uk ? 
   stay in their cosmopolitan , highly liberal bubbles , indeed just like home !, 
   more like 184 since reunification so 2015 in france . 
  my bad . 
  i remembered it like that . 
   more worried about right-wing terror eh . 
  live your life . 
  the odds are miniscule . 
  9 people out of 80 million ... that 's ridiculously low odds . 
  i was pissed on the day , but i do n't really regret portugal winning . 
  you guys deserved a win after all this time . 
  we did get to beat germany so that 's our win . 
  / u/lari-fari was talking about civil war . 
  you need large groups of people on two opposite sides to have a civil war . 
  breivik caused about 0 civil wars . 
  \u00e0 la fran\u00e7ais ** e ** ( it 's shorthand for \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re fran\u00e7ais ** e ** ) . 
   the motive does n't matter here . 
  i stopped reading here . 
  good day , 
  pastafarians would have a boring time in france . 
   i 'm a lot more afraid of some neo nazis than of muslims . 
  maybe we can exchange some of our islamic extremists for some of your neo nazis , then ? 
   the w\u00fcrzburg axe attacker oh for fucks sake man . 
  the guy was an afghan refugee that attacked a bunch of hk . 
  you really have to have your head up somewhere to think that germany is importing nazi afghans to attack chinese people . 
   the munich shooter targeted foreigners . 
  while tragic , it 's important to not ignore the context . 
  to what extreme right group is he connected ? 
  basically none . 
  86 people were killed 200m from where i live yet you do n't see me running for the hills shouting `` the moslems are out to get meeeee !, 
  portugal does n't suck in attack like germany : s, 
  losing the euro final does that to you . 
  i think you 're grossly overestimating the dangers in nowadays society . 
  look at france . 
  after some of the bloodiest attacks since 1945 , the weird shit we had was some towns banning the burkini . 
  that 's not exactly invading poland levels of aggression . 
  you can not be part of the single market without freedom of movement . 
  go ask even friggin adam smith . 
  why does ticino suffer the most when the french are actually the largest workforce that crosses the border ? 
  at least double the number of italians . 
  also all french speaking cantons voted no ( vaud was at 60-65 of no ) . 
   it 's just ticino . 
  i 'm from vaud and we dislike the french , and those in zurich dislike the germans . 
  did you look at the voting results ? 
  vaud in its majority ( 60-65 % ) voted no . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_immigration_referendum,_february_2014#/media/file%3aanti-einwanderungsinitiative_2014.svg all french speaking cantons voted no . 
  maybe you overestimate the hate . 
  have you ever signed a work contract ? 
  * yes ? 
  : then go read it . 
  : go talk to someone that has . 
  they 'll tell you while humans are not a commodity , ** their time is ** . 
  when you sign a work contract you are basically selling your time ( which you can not receive back , thermodynamics is a bitch ) in exchange for money . 
  work contracts do n't mince their words . 
  your time , during set periods of the work day no longer belongs to you , you are not free to dispose of it as you want . 
  it belongs to the employer who can dispose of it as they wish ( with restrictions ) . 
  it did n't help that greenspan was a believer in the magic of self regulation . 
   thrown into a classroom in australia without any english , i dont see why it would be any different in greece . 
  well then i 'm sure they 'll quickly pick up greek :d, 
   if epidemiologists never said a thing about such risks , it 's probably because they have nothing to say . 
  did anyone ask them ? 
   asylum seekers are under much closer medical supervision than most locals ever going to be . 
  like how all refugees are properly identified in greece and all their paperworks checked ? 
  dude this is not the us that actually is thorough , this is europe where we go : sure guys , that 'll do !, 
  and what about the kids ? 
  the teachers will teach them in english , but the kids aren ' r english refugees so you 'll need arabic translators there . 
  how many do you guys have of those ? 
   and the right to work does n't prevent you from being unemployed . 
  and the right to education does n't prevent you from not having a school to go to .
