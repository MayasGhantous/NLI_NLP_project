  english is n't your first language but it makes it harder to understand . 
  i am very afraid . 
  please . 
  i must avoid that area . 
  please stop minimising the dangers of these ** hungarian no go zones **, 
  this does n't seem very safe http://hungarytoday.hu/news/hungarian-police-bust-criminal-gang-made-millions-trafficking-prostitutes-france-20469 i 'd rather not visit a place that is heavily involved in human trafficking . 
  it 's a no go zone for me : /, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate homicide rates are 0.1 higher in hungary than in uk . 
  i am sure we can find no go zones in hungary too . 
  did uk ever publish a list of those ? 
  oh and your claim :  these sort of travel warnings exist for any country but when the hungarians did it it 's the big deal . 
  http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/conseils-par-pays/royaume-uni/ here is the french notice : it is advised to avoid walking at night in some suburbs ( which are n't named btw ) and to be generally careful . 
  to be vigilant in soho and leicester on weekends because of drunk people . 
  there 's no mention of areas you must avoid , no go zones etc. 
  are the hungarian more pussies than the french ? 
  that proved people wrong !, 
   maybe i 'm the crazy here yeah you are . 
  the hungarian dude was full on bullshitting and that pissed the journalist . 
  pissed people are n't always 100 % rational , true . 
  but still . 
  no go zones in uk ? 
  wtf ? 
  sounds like bullshit to me , but i do n't have the energy to refute it . 
   only time will tell if they will pass it or no how will time tell that before the vote ? 
   abolishment of slavery eh . 
  that 's a very wild stretch since the first abolitionists tended to be church people . 
   lets just wait and see what happens , if it gets voted in . 
  sorry but that 's stupid . 
  guys you can protest ** after ** the law is passed !, 
  wtf ? 
  you protest before to show the parlament you do n't want it . 
   poll results what do the polls say ? 
  wow . 
  so deep james cameron went after it : o, 
  if you 've arrived at ceuta though , you 've gone too far . 
  i am simply trying to understand why someone would make shitty comments out of the blue with no connection to the conversation  there has to be a reason somewhere , somehow . 
  neah it 's okay . 
  i think we already established you 're most likely a decre\u021bel and i 'm pretty sure we know starea de ebrietate a p\u0103rin\u021bilor la concep\u021bie  . 
  so it 's ok . 
  it 's really not your fault for getting some sort of sadistic pleasure in referencing tragic events that have no connection whatsoever with the discussion at hand  have a nice day . 
  almost always under 5 % . 
  compare that to the level of education in developed countries ... 
   more well-educated transylvania has more cases than moldavia . 
  romania is pretty homogenous in terms of education levels . 
  steer ? 
  hmm ... is it a coincidence most cases are in mures , arad , timis ? 
  i am not talking about possible events but probable ones . 
  ecb already did a ton of qe and bought a lot of debt . 
  it has n't produced a significant drop in the euro . 
  we 're talking about bulgarian economy . 
  they wo n't break the peg for shitts and giggles but because either the euro or lev have issues . 
  which one do you think is more stable ? 
  extreme economic conditions ? 
  for the eurozone or for bulgaria ? 
  well abortion is still forgiven but it will always be a grave sin . 
  how 's that different from what they had before ? 
  ask what the pope thinks about abortion in cases of incest or rape . 
   the is economic reason not to have too high deficits . 
  how high ? 
  there is no reason why 3 % should be a magical number . 
  doubt that 's a popular measure atm . 
  guys let 's create inflation and have prices sky rocket . 
  when the imf tells u that the austerity measures are stupid ... you should realise you 've done something stupid . 
  unlike people countries does n't have a finite lifespan . 
  if spending will make them more efficient , then so be it . 
  check the history of the 3 % it 's ridiculous  ), 
   no , maastricht criteria are not arbitrary . 
  like / u/problemy said , the rules are arbitrary . 
  the 3 % rule is utter bs made by a guy in 1981 cuz it sounded fancy.he thought a bit . 
  1-2 % seemed too restrictive . 
  4-5 was too much . 
  3 was just right . 
  simple , made to sound professional . 
  etc http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.fr/2014/01/from-archives-story-of-3-deficit-limit.html?m=1 there 's no economics reason for it . 
  yup . 
  same for schengen . 
  we had this massive : guys let 's make things in common , it 'll be awesome . 
  so we have common borders without eu border controls and without copying intelligence organisations . 
  we have common currency without common fiscal policies . 
  makes no sense . 
  you 're already pegged to the euro . 
  if euro will suffer volatility problems , bulgaria will suffer even more . 
   i believe pope francis is pushing for reforms in quite a few of those areas . 
  good luck with th\u00e9 abortion . 
  that wo n't happen this century . 
  i got an arrow in the knee from the brits . 
  \\ #agincourt never forget, 
  * cough * bunga bunga * cough * ps : that 's not a proposition . 
  well excuse us for not being 6 times larger . 
  the important statistic here is per capita not absolute numbers . 
  you 're in the wrong but i 'll let you argue with yourself . 
  cheers . 
  3 time pulitzer winner = = aziz ansari . 
  mkay, 
  that 's why we look at per capita numbers and no absolute numbers ... 
  the opinion section of thomas friedman . 
  aka not just any random journalist ( 3 pulitzer prizes ) . 
  40 % is ** huge ** at a first round and makes her extremelly likely to win . 
  it just wo n't happen at 40 % . 
  only pompidou managed that in 1969 but that was after cdg resigned after popular movements in paris .
