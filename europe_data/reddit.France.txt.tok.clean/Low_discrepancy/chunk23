  not all issues . 
  when france banned the capital punishment , the majority of the people were against it . 
  nowadays the majority want to bring it back again . 
  can we have more context around this image ? 
  thank you . 
  that 's highly debatable `` research '' . 
   it 's not a genocide , though . 
  it 's mass murder . 
  lemkin on genocide :  generally speaking , genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation , except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation . 
  it is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups , with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves . 
  the objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions , of culture , language , national feelings , religion , and the economic existence of national groups , and the destruction of the personal security , liberty , health , dignity , and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups . 
  so yeah srebenica was a genocide . 
  sorry man . 
  the claim was that the serbians were targeting enemy soldiers ... 
  so it was n't really a genocide , just a war crime cuz they simply killed enemy soldiers ... that kind of `` logic '' would break down for a 13 yo , but apparently no . 
  even a 13 yo is an enemy soldier or smth . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right ... : / you apply the law that has to be applied . 
   he is n't fined for hate speech from 20 years ago eh ... just look at his book titles . 
  he could very easily be convicted of defamation of character . 
  that 's a law even in the us . 
  that 's the spirit . 
  we take them in , you shoot 'em up ... 
  distatesful ? 
  [ some would disagree ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpxvgqnjm0w&amp;t=0m16s ), 
  ca n't you take a joke man ? 
  if you can take nato bombing , then you can also take a joke . 
  it 's not like he was talking about it for 2 minutes . 
  we has at it for a long time till you know , it got completely ridiculous . 
  i think you misunderstood what / u/badblueboy146 said . 
  yes hateful politicians are everywhere . 
  but when jmlp produces hate speech he gets fined * the rule of the law . 
  in france or uk the rule of the law is applied . 
  in serbia it is not since the guy can produce those comments without getting fined or arrested . 
  \\* to the best of my knowledge , neither mlp nor farange produced hate speech . 
  either way , the class was n't about foreign habits . 
  it was about engineering ' and more specifically research opportunities in engineering . 
  talk about his drinking games with the russians was off topic by 35000 feet . 
  he 's working in a franco-german company . 
  this is france . 
  we 're not an ocean away . 
  plus she 's like been here for 1.5 years . 
   presentation + q&a ( semi-optional ) + whatever ( super-optional ) da fuq ? 
  we 're you there ? 
  the q+a was mandatory . 
  the guy was there for 2 hours . 
  after his presentation he went off on a tangent and was called out on it . 
  i 'm not about to lose one hour of my life hearing inate stories , sorry . 
  it was n't something fixed but it was n't `` okay i 'll talk to you about my hobbies and fun little anecdotes with my friends '' . 
  you talk about engineering because that 's the context . 
   he could 've packed up and fucked off . 
  again he had 2 hours to fill . 
  he knew the rules beforehand . 
  of course of he went to q&a and finished early he could have fucked off . 
  it would have been better for everybody . 
  i do n't wan na be forced to listen to his personal stories , just like you would n't like to be forced to listen to mine . 
  i 'm not sure what your beef is . 
  if you 're invited to speak about topic a and you talk about what you had for lunch people will get upset that you 're wasting their time . 
  i know . 
  it was the serbian version of that . 
  i agree with you on that one . 
  science is n't a democracy , but oh well . 
   i 'm concerned he could spend the q&a doing cartwheels if there are no questions to answer . 
  i can not remember the sequence of events but the q & a mostly revolved around me asking pertinent questions ( again i knew quite a bit about the industry and airbus ) . 
  and the questions were asked only after i called him out and he cut the nonsense of his personal stories . 
   i 'd regard your stance as extremely rude , again , in my opinion . 
  do n't come talking to students if you did n't prepare your work and you wan na half-ass it then  you might get called out on it . 
  not really . 
  was talking to a serbian . 
  she started going on a rant about how can it be called a genocide . 
  a 13 yo guy killed at srebenica can be a soldier . 
  http://m.imgur.com/a/ezoou then complained about western media , and how okay it 's okay they convicted karadic , i guess they needed someone to pin it on and they found him . 
  weird how people complain about the west while living in a western country and benefiting from its generosity in giving phd grants . 
   so he kindly does his presentation for you students and in the time allotted for q&a and stories again he is supposed to talk about ** engineering ** related stories , projects etc. 
  nobody cared about his inate stories about him drinking vodka and how cool he is ( yup true story ) . 
   business ethics again ** engineer school ** . 
  if you wan na talk about business go do a presentation in an mba . 
   you go off on him because he was n't talking about what you wanted . 
  i wanted ? 
  he did n't talk about what he was supposed to , which is engineering related aspect about the aerospatial industry . 
  i took particular offense because i was about to do my internship at airbus and was super stoked to hear more about the different projects . 
  he dropped the ball . 
  was called out on it , and no one complained about being called out on it ... weird , it 's like every other engineer student also wanted to hear a talk about engineering projects and no bottle stories . 
  he should get a blog for that . 
   but the way he shot down some of the inanity of the tribunal was oddly satisfying . 
  well at least that 'll convince the serbians that it 's not a kangaroo court hell bent on prosecuting all serbians . 
  this puts a lot more weight on the sentences already given . 
  not as much as those srebenica men ... oh wait ... : /, 
  engineering students that wan na talk about engineering ... crazy i know . 
   to foot the bill to society too . 
  it 's their fault if people leave school thinking water has memory and not understanding how dilution works . 
  sauce . 
  or is this a placebo comment ? 
  add drinking to that . 
  how many deaths in russia can be attributed to rampant alcoholism . 
  how much domestic abuse etc etc. 
  but we still laugh cuz it 's funny . 
  story time : a vp from airbus uk was visiting my engineering school . 
  he does his presentation and we had an hour of q&a , stories etc etc. 
  the guy goes on a tangent on how he won i do n't know what russian contract because he got drunk with some russian academy of sciences official that had to green light everything . 
  and it 's an elaborate story , the guy brags about how good of a drinker he is etc etc.
