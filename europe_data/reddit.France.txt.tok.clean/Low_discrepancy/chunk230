  so i really doubt it 'll be a thing . 
   some countries are already annoyed by the german and french childish politics regarding london , frankfurt and paris . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   it really does n't a mutually beneficial deal is a positive for both the eu and the uk . 
  of course . 
  but that 's just truism . 
  we do n't know what a mutually beneficial deal is . 
  you can trust gunnar because he 's not french . 
  you have borders in australia ? 
   who decide where goldman goldman is n't free to put money wherever it wants . 
  it 's not its money . 
  it 's the clients money and in many cases a lot of restrictions do apply ( for the nth time : pension funds ) . 
   by registering a field office in frankfurt - which every major bank already has , and funnelling clearing through there . 
  and those offices will increase in size with the new activity . 
  whales or ducks ? 
   we were more miffed about germany . 
  how old were you at the time ? 
   has a license to provide advisory services to corporations in the eu how would they retain that right if uk leaves eea , pray tell . 
  if uk leaves no uk based entity will be forced to comply to eu regulation . 
  eu can change any regulation it wishes and most likely it will . 
  having eu pension funds buy products that are not subject to eu regulation is not going to happen any time soon . 
  you can put your quants , mv and risk teams wherever no one cares and they do not produce money in and of themselves which is what i considered for advisors . 
  they 're internal to the bank . 
  what brings money to the bank is the client bank interface , which due to regulation might not be able to always be anywhere in the globe . 
  not many large pensions funds are allowed to go do their business in the caymans, 
  [ your citation ] ( http://siteresources.worldbank.org/intpensions/resources/395443-1121194657824/prpnoteportlimits.pdf ) pdf beware :  limits on investments allowed . 
  quantitative restrictions on the share of particular types of assets held by the fund limit the dispersion of outcomes , particularly for defined contribution schemes . 
  in most mandatory schemes , this leads to a ` single portfolio ' environment where members of the scheme are forced to hold basically the same portfolio . 
  most common are limits on risky assets such as shares and corporate bonds . 
  often , foreign investments are curtailed . 
  & nbsp ;  or that the industry in the uk will collapse . 
  did i ever say that ? 
  i am simply expressing that contrary to what / u/cimarafa said , it wo n't be just  at absolutely best , a small number of back office jobs will move to continental europe . 
  but euro clearing activities and the ones we 've already mentioned . 
   good job on that refutation . 
  garbage in garbage out i always say :d, 
   ooh no , condescendance . 
  whatever shall we do !, 
   it 's simply a more complex nice turn of phrase  some funds again like pension funds which are very large are not allowed to invest in complex products . 
   simply have to register yes . 
  `` simply '' have to fully comply with eu regulation  jpmorgan chase jpm could be forced to move thousands of staff out of britain if the country loses its automatic right to sell financial services to the european union after last month 's brexit vote , bank ceo jamie dimon but what does the ceo of the largest us bank know ? 
   the pope used to be a secular leader as well as being a religious one . 
  christianity existed way before 313 ( about 300 years before ) . 
  and the council that came after to define what christianity really was , were more focused on theological aspects and reigning in sectarian beliefs , which were many since christianity diffused . 
  they had little focus on establishing a christian cannon law . 
  in comparison with islam that was political from the get go , with mohammed having his conquering periods . 
   , not sorting something out will cause big issues so you mean brexit is n't clear cut . 
  til . 
   sweden ( for example ) sign a contract the jurisdiction for dispute resolution will often be specified as the uk you will notice both countries are in the eu . 
  you ca n't force a client to establish us or whatever . 
  in many cases that simply might be illegal when the client is a pension fund for example that has severe restrictions . 
  you can either apply the same regulation as the eu ( through mifid 2 ) or you 'll diverge at some point meaning that eu consumers wo n't get the same protections in the eu if they deal in uk . 
   earlier so that implied you were unaware or were going out of your way to be a cunt . 
  you are free to not reply . 
  and if you reply out of context like / u/candayence prepare to meet my exasperation ... 
  i love the bs emails : db is pulling a greece . 
  btw watch the big short it 's amazing, 
  a ton of derivatives are very normal insurance contracts . 
  or exchange contracts . 
  a fuck ton of derivatives never get executed because the risk they were ensuring against never happened . 
   if some sort of arrangement is made to allow the jurisdiction . 
  big ** if ** . 
  if you do n't retain passport rights that means i wo n't be able to buy my insurance from a uk based company but from an eu one . 
  if something goes sour , we wo n't go to uk to settle our cases because that wo n't make any sense whatsoever ... trying to settle cases in third party countries . 
   also i refuse to believe you are n't fully aware that starting a reply `` sigh '' is condescending as all hell . 
  we 'll make a safe space for you . 
   $ 1.5 quadrillion `` notational value '' in derivatives is quite astounding . 
  yeah but they wo n't get executed at once . 
  it 's like calculating how much money you can win by betting 1 dollar on the roulette . 
  you can 1 dollar if you get black , 1 dollar if you bet red , etc but it 's kinda dishonest to say there 's atleast 2 dollars in wins everytime you play the roulette since you ca n't win black * and * red . 
   `` sarkozy does n't want france becoming too anglo-saxon '' to be fair none of our politicians want that ... except for macron maybe but he doesnt count for much . 
   greater proportion of foreign-born residents have anywhere near the problems with integration that france does . 
  ah yes . 
  the us at a mighty 13.1 , the uk at an amazing 12.3 and the french at a puny 11.7 but i am happy the us has n't experienced any terrorist attacks in the last 5 years . 
  eh nothing old . 
  here is thomas friedman on [ our war with france ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/18/opinion/our-war-with-france.html ), 
   though you 'd have to get christians to actually agree on some sort of biblical law first . 
  exactly this . 
  i am confused how people much like / u/blueflaggoldenstars can not see the difference between a religion that has turned political after centuries of being created and one that was political from the get go . 
   universities which is forbidden no it 's not . 
   how do you exchange rates and international purchases work ? 
  what does exhange rates have to do with anything ? 
  this is n't an investment strategy , an insurance plan or whatever . 
  i can not buy insurance from singapore since singapore does n't have passport rights to the eu . 
   but you were asking `` what 's that [ ecl ] got to do with europe ? '', 
  that translates to `` what connection does ecl have with european law ? '', 
  the correct answer is ** none ** !, 
   i 've no idea what the bnp has to do with this , they 're a dead party . 
  holy fuck , you 're trying to pretend you know finance but you do n't know what bnp is  ) . 
  good job man . 
   but if a eu citizen bought advice from a british bank post-brexit , the sale would take place in the uk banks , funds etc can not do that  good day . 
   it 's condescension by the way , not condescendence . 
  not m ' y fault you changed a perfectly good word . 
   explain something you guys did n't explain to me anything useful to the debate . 
  you were talking about something irrelevant to the discussion . 
   euros and dollars without foreign agents looking over their shoulders if london banks do illegal things with dollars , the us will fine them through the nose . 
  it happened with the libor scandal ( in london ) , it happened with bnp . 
  so that is already bs . 
  regarding your comment , you will realise that all those countries are in the eu . 
  thanks .
