  if you wan na sell me a product , you 'll have to abide by the rules of the country i 'm in  and europeans tend to be in european countries not uk . 
  what condescendence . 
  you and / u/heknarf did n't bother reading the conversation at hand . 
  * sigh * . 
  we 're talking about passporting and doing business in the eu . 
  you can make whatever legal system you want in your country , it wo n't affect the eu at all . 
   it 's worth looking at the legal systems of the suggested countries . 
  no we 're talking about companies that will sell their services in europe . 
   another benefit of london is english common law . 
  uhm . 
  what 's that got to do with europe ? 
  for me electoral colleges make ** no ** sense . 
  your bs primaries make ** no ** sense neither does your fptp system or your incredibly low turnout rate , neither does imperial . 
  yet here you are . 
  i 'm sure in some ideal world your concerns and mine would be addressed but we do n't live in an ideal world . 
  shoudda woudda coudda are n't exactly things that can be debated so i ca n't say much but shrug . 
   there is no requirement that the investment banker providing advisory to a european corporation be located in europe or have a european work visa - or else , half the american mds who fly to europe twice a month to do just that would be in jail . 
  you can put your advisor on the moon for all i care . 
  the sale of that advice will have to be done in europe . 
  so all sales teams would move on the continent . 
  the cash exchange will happen in europe . 
  lawyers will most likely also have to move in europe when dealing with european matters . 
  also all the clearing offices , that 'll move in europe . 
  not bad for a first go . 
  hedge funds might not like the volatility of brexit and move to singapore or hk . 
  either way ... 
  i 've got my pop corn . 
   being a frenchman my god : o, 
   germany does n't control the ecb . 
  and the nsa does n't read my emails and other wonderfully magical stories  you do not have to control it to wield a large amount of soft power . 
  it being in germany sends a clear message on that soft power and who wields it . 
  the day the ecb will move will be another important message . 
  diplomacy is n't what trump is doing . 
   the eu will have difficulties eliminating or merging or shrinking or growing particular institutions . 
  again read my previous comment . 
  people do n't wan na give away power easily . 
  i do n't understand why that confuses you . 
  the eu already had difficulties , has difficulties and will have difficulties . 
  it 's like telling me the sky is blue and water is wet . 
  yes !, 
   might impose permanent political constraints * sigh * . 
  maybe you refuse to understand that the eu is a process where we have to voluntarily ** give away ** power . 
  the us formed by ** taking ** power . 
  last time a part of the us tried to gain power from another part , you had big problems . 
  nobody wants to give away power . 
  not your central govt , not your state govt ... look at texas . 
  try making a union with canada , see how smoothly it goes . 
  is the pentagon in washington dc ? 
  did it manage to survive without being there ? 
  and you 're a federation . 
  poland is basically us 's lapdog so that wo n't happen . 
  i kinda wonder what 's the point of all of this ... it 's like a couple that just met talking about their floral arrangements at their wedding instead of bothering to build their relationship . 
  we do n't know pretty much anything about what this `` european army '' will be . 
  most likely i think it will fizzle out like so many projects before it or end up being some glorified border patrol . 
   most political power - hey there germany ... germany has the most financial/economic power : hey ecb !, 
  and not political . 
  like it or not , politics is about compromise . 
  military ** is n't ** . 
  it is the most fundamental aspect of a country . 
  there 's one military that counts in continental eu , you can guess which one that is . 
  we can share all types of institutions but military knowledge or capabilites ... not gon na happen very soon . 
  i do not actually want french intel to fall too much on german hands known for passing info to the white house or to poland . 
  well luckly we do n't have the most powerful military on continental eu ... oh wait ... 
   only eu country with nukes , or the most powerful military ... 
  if we count military might as the capability of producing ones nukes without help from other nations yeah ... 
  if we count it as capability to spy on others with the help of other countries , no . 
   bail out the city less when their next round of fuckups come to fruition . 
  did you bail out gs , jpm , morgan stanley , lehman bros , db , socgen and a ton of other banks that do business in the city ? 
  * sigh * . 
  i 'm simply explaining that there 's a far ** larger ** contribution of exports than the 475 bn dollars which / u/heknarf does n't account for . 
  if rolls royce buys a lugnut from your local joe for an engine they 'll see outside of uk , do you think that that transaction will count as an export ? 
   french tgvs have insanely high prices . 
  compared to what ? 
   i 'm pretty sure that it 's the case even in eu countries where it 's still run by the gov no . 
  except toulouse-paris and nice-paris . 
  why do they spend so much time at home if they do n't bother getting an education ? 
  are you one of those experts that says london has a big impact on uk economy ? 
   juncker and co. are selling the fur before shooting the bear as always . 
  the speed at which this is happening and the fact that at least france 's govt will change in 2017 shows that people should calm down a bit . 
  having all these institutions in a single place is a bad idea . 
  every country of the eu should have one institution or another . 
  sure it 's less `` efficient '' ( whatever an efficient govt institution means ) but this is a group effort . 
  govts are giving up their authority to the eu which should be more than just bruxelles . 
   than its size should allow . 
  the important distinction here . 
  relative power never meant much when dealing with huge countries . 
  yeah . 
  you had to join a group with 2 more countries to gain some shred of relevance . 
  just like nowadays you have to act like continental ireland to be relevant in some way . 
  hey not my fault netherlands is largely irrelevant for the european project : /, 
  you mean the ecb is in bruxelles 3 weeks per month ? 
  til . 
   you give the french you probably forget that france was the dominating power when ecsc was created . 
  where 's the ecb located buddy ? 
  gone wrong ? 
  not gone wrong ? 
  sorry not interested then . 
  what do they teach you over there ? 
  darn education in romania must really stink . 
  did all the professors and teachers leave , just like the doctors ?
