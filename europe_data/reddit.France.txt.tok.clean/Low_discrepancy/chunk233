  the eu lost it 's 3rd largest contributor and the country that by 2050 might be the largest european economy . 
  they and we will be poorer as a result . 
  guys why wo n't you believe me when i 'm saying that we 're stronger than ever before . 
  of course it 's not the only issue . 
  but it 's one of many and a very important one . 
  countries lose an important tool that allows them to be competitive . 
  if control over your currency is n't that important why is china holding an iron grip on its and the us complaining about it ? 
   yet the eu is still here and stronger than before . 
  uk left but we 're stronger than ever before baby !, 
  if you have no job ( job promises ) or a place of residence , you have to leave schengen area after 3 months . 
   i am pretty sure italy has had almost 15 years of 0 growth ... do n't be so sure . 
  if france ever finds itself in such a situation , you can bet the eu will be flushed down the toilet . 
   against , lik against the euro , against the eu ? 
   the front national are very unlikely to win the 2nd round silly man . 
  we 're not talking about 2017 . 
  we 're talking about 2037 . 
   you just described a lot of rural communities well fix that and we 'll talk . 
  pickpocketing is n't a deportation worthy offence . 
  it 's a low level crime . 
  sure we can deport people for jaywalking but i 'm not really keen on living in a police state . 
  again however that less integration is defined , it will have to happen because countries do not want to go forward . 
  i do n't see poland or romania cheering about having to join the euro . 
  they 're postponing as much as they can . 
   new generation comes a long ether yeah except those people vote fn . 
  that 's a bit of a bummer is n't it ? 
   the uk never opted for the euro while france did so i am not sure quite what you are getting to there by comparing the euro with brexit i am looking at who will be the main candidate after the first turn in 2017 . 
  all polls give the person that wants to quickly remove france out of the euro and wants a referendum for france whether to leave the eu . 
  how is that relevant . 
  the gypsies do n't benefit from any major social benefit ( except maybe some fringe ones ) . 
  they 're not employed , they 've never been employed in france , they 're not students , they do n't rent a home . 
  so basically they get 0 benefits . 
   and to allow even eu citizens to be sent back to their home country in case of crimes . 
  nobody has time to deport trespassers which is basically the only crime most commit . 
  do you define : occupying a tent and not having any job as `` living '' ? 
  because the eu does n't . 
  the eu is not a project made to stagnate . 
  and the euro is stagnating . 
  badly . 
   it 's not as if when you abandon a policy there is any less unpicking and untangling to be done than when you reform one , as the uk is discovering . 
  turns out the poor rebel . 
  and when a rebellion or a revolution happens , the poor are the ones that suffer the most ... that does n't stop rebellions and revolutions from happening . 
   those are reserved seats that they can take without even needing to pass exams . 
  they still have a selection with grades from thebac . 
  it 's not they present themselves and just get in . 
   this is n't really our fault . 
  mkay . 
  they were just born uneducated ... 
  ever been to a roma village since most do live in rural communities . 
  the conditions are appalling . 
  how much funding for infrastructure do they get if the barely have electricity , roads are shitty , education is crap cuz no normal teacher would want to go there . 
  c'mon man stop playing dumb . 
  where did they prove stiglitz wrong ? 
  stiglitz presented logical arguments . 
  the euro in its current form is a retarded thing . 
  2 ways out : more integration or less integration . 
  since european countries are against more integration , stiglitz suggests then the lesser integration . 
  that does n't mean it wo n't be painful but that does n't mean either that he is * wrong * . 
  he 's just a guy stating the facts and your options . 
  like a doctor telling you you have cancer so you either die or do chemo . 
  and the euro in it 's current state will die according to [ this graph ] ( http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/local/cache-vignettes/l530xh494/graph4-6e28f.jpg ) . 
  i give it at most 20 years . 
  just look at the relative poverty for france and uk . 
  it 's about similar except when you reach 60 + where french rates are half the rates of uk . 
  you know who keeps fn out of public offices ? 
  they have something to lose . 
  when you have nothing to lose , you go kamikaze . 
  and what recent kamikaze event happened in uk that was the doing of the poor older class ? 
   but they seem to keep making it back in regardless of the border controls in place such is the eu . 
  but that still means we can keep dismantling their camps until they realise they 're not welcome in the conditions . 
  it is not a safe environment for them nor for the people living at proximity . 
  is it ghastly to see shanty towns proping up . 
  and not to mention so so so many beggars and shitty street artists . 
   will bust under age gypsies and simply let them go because it 's impossible that 's why their parents need to get expulsed . 
   just because of a small minority that wo n't / ca n't integrate . 
  we have our own nomads etc. 
  and while our treatment has n't been very kindly and things can get tense , you can not claim that they go bother other countries . 
  the type of attitude that nothing can be done so just let it be , is not what is helping ... ** at all ** . 
   but it does n't make sense to punish all of the honest romanians ( many of whom are well integrated into western europe ) i fail to see the punishment ... romanians can enter france freely . 
   they get free prioritised university that 's bull . 
  they get a * small * number of reserved seats . 
  that university has some 5000 open seats each year . 
  that 's 1 % of seats , given that there are about 3 % of the population ( numbers based on self declaration though so actual numbers would be higher ) . 
  same goes for babes bolyai , [ 60 ] ( http://admitere.ubbcluj.ro/ro/licenta/candidati_de_etnie_rroma/ ) places , only 17 occupied . 
  so claiming that they get prioritised access is a joke . 
   and other social things like that well gypsies have an unemployment rate ranging between 2-4 times higher than the rest of the population . 
  [ only 10 % ] ( http://www.gandul.info/stiri/situatia-romilor-din-romania-doar-10-dintre-romi-au-lucrat-constant-in-ultimii-doi-ani-90-dintre-toti-cei-care-sustin-ca-lucreaza-muncesc-de-fapt-la-negru-9666496 ) declared to have had a steady job in the last 2 years , ** 51 % ** had no job in the last 2 years . 
  i do not even want to look at number of gypsies in higher education . 
  france has already big big problems , we do n't others . 
   a possible radical change in france 's position towards romania 's accession to schengen that 's not radical at all . 
  translation : france is favorable to romanian joining schengen if it is in 2 steps : first the airports and after the sea ports and land borders . 
  but on the 24th of september , valls said niet . 
  they 're playing their classic good cop bad cop routine . 
  and since hollande wont be president come may , it 's all moot . 
  that 's a fine speech to have until you live next to a gypsy camp which are quite a few in france . 
  or you go to the eiffel tower and see them playing scam based games for tourists or they pickpocket in the subway . 
  [ 11000 were expulsed in 2015 ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2016/01/12/plus-de-11-000-expulsions-de-roms-en-2015_4845797_3224.html ) the problem is not at all solved and romania is doing little to tackle the issue . 
   what sort of threats are they concerned about ? 
  gypsies . 
  you can deport non schengen citizens if they overstayed the 3 months period . 
  well this is another way ee can shoulder the refugee problem .
