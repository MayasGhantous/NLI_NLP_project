  obviously who was counting the votes ended up counting the sticks of glue . 
  you do n't get that in france ( at least it depends what you mean by dental care ) . 
  usually the poor have more significant dental issues and when it 's more significant it 's not covered ( or it 's covered only at the level of 10-20 % ) . 
  so crowns get up to 1000 euros , implants to 2000 . 
  what do you mean ? 
  itt people that are more smarter than the experts . 
   this measure is flawed , as this limit is rising if the average incomes are rising do you live in a service based economy ? 
  well then it 's not a flawed measure . 
  as median salary rises , then service costs rise . 
  the bill at the restaurant is up , getting a hair cut is up , buying new clothes , up , finding an apartment to rent , up going to the dentist to fix your cavity , up , calling the plumber because a water pipe burst , up . 
  this means you can no longer save and you 're loving on a paycheck to paycheck . 
  stop acting like you 're more intelligent than so many economists on this planet that really looked into the matter . 
   you are entitled do you know what entitled means ? 
   as a university student i lived far below the fictional ` poverty line ' and got along quite well while hoping you do n't have any emergency dental problems , the pipes do n't randomly burst in your flat , that your laptop does n't have a random breakdown , the key does n't break in your lock . 
  any of these issues can end up costing you upwards of 1000 euros meaning next month you ca n't pay the rent . 
  all this ignoring that you ca n't go out as often as your friends you ca n't go to vacations outside too far etc. 
  so if you really lived far below the poverty line , no you did n't get along quite fine . 
  or you had a huge amount of luck to not have a single issue in 5 years . 
   somebody is richer than them pushing them into the povery bracket . 
  you sound it 's some ridiculous concept . 
  i advice you to go work in london or the valley then . 
  yes :d, 
   final solution to a problem . 
  there 's no such thing in maths . 
  comic ? 
   ) we 're pretty loose with words i see . 
  looks like a local/short distance train ? 
   he also went reinstituted slavery in france nope , not in france . 
  slavery still existed in the french over seas regions . 
  i wonder why they 're doing this . 
  surely the plane is a bit dated . 
  deffo no fly by wire . 
  you 'd need massive overhalls to modernise it . 
   who happened to be a white french male , for anyone else , not so much . 
  yeah no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon_and_the_jews, 
  eh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon_and_the_jews, 
  not so ironical considering how big of a threat the russian empire was to the ottomans . 
   the unio trium natiunum was only about nobles . 
  peasants were all equally oppressed , regardless of nationality . 
  ** and ** szekelys and saxons that lived in certain cities . 
   john hunyadi was the voivode of transylvania and totally romanian . 
  how is that totally romanian ? 
   and how would they have equal rights in france if they didnt have the right to education in their native language ? 
  a certain right of vote , equal to others from other areas . 
  what was the voting right of romanians in transylvania ? 
   the regions were part of montenegro when they conquered them in 1913 from the ottoman empire this is 2016 , not 1913 . 
  no point in looking what happened 100 years ago . 
  why did they not vote by county ? 
  this seems madness . 
  some of those regions are adjacent to serbia . 
   around 16th-17th century bucharest was a big hellenic cultural center , as rulers sent by ottomans were mostly greek traders . 
  also a period of a large degree of oppression since those phanariotes had to pay back the bribes given to the ottomans to obtain their throne back . 
  in the context of the rise of romanian nationalism , having a foreign ruler became more and more unwanted . 
  there was no genocide in dorbuja . 
  people just moved from a place that no longer was theirs ( obtained through military conquest might i remind you ) to a place where they could feel more at home . 
  when you occupy a territory you expose yourself to a certain risk , 
  did the serbians on this map vote for independence from serbia ? 
  how did they decide the borders because this is just odd . 
   magyarisation was inspired by this french practice in the first place yes oppression of the romanians was something you did for a long long time . 
  see the [ unio trium nationum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unio_trium_nationum ) in 1438 that marginalised romanians even more while giving special priviledges to saxons and the szekelys . 
   ofc its obvious that ww1 is why the hungarian one failed , and the french one didnt . 
  one failed because it was after a long period of dismissal of rights and oppression of other people that never were hungarians while in the second case they still had the same rights as any other person living in the kindgdom of france . 
  surely it can not come as a surprise that in 1916 , romania first invades transylvania . 
  hard to ignore the conflicts though , the bitterness between the different communities . 
  at least in france , for better or worse you 're french in the north , the south , in the east and west . 
  after you light be something else as a little variance to add some spice . 
  but you 're still mostly french . 
  can you say that about spain ? 
  when people start demanding cultural protections , they do n't do it to spread their culture , they do it to shut others down . 
  it 's their home not ours blah blah blah when it 's actually a shared environment , a shared country . 
  and france does not work like spain . 
  like it or not the largest centers of activity are in the parisian regions : the best unis , the best jobs etc etc. 
  you simply have to move , it happens naturally . 
   about integration into the french state and why it does n't work when 60k frenchmen only speak catalan ( and that as a second language ) . 
  or 50k breton also as a second language , this can only show integration goes ** very ** well ... we even assimilate . 
   we churn turn churn to make frenchmen . 
   the case of catalonia in spain ( a fully bilingual society ) shows that those fears are unfounded . 
  really ? 
  cuz i heard they wan na split up . 
   i just went into rossell\u00f3 and there was 0 promotion of catalan culture . 
  wtf is rosello ? 
  that being said go tell any french catalan student that they 've been admitted to polytechnique . 
  see how many refuse to go  it 'll be about 0 . 
   french nationalism won , austrian and hungarian lost , i fail to understand why / u/istencsaszar is getting so worked up . 
  magyarisation was quite fierce in the hungarian part wet to slovaks or romanians . 
  maybe he should look a little bit at history why one succeeded while another failed . 
  or look at louisiana where creole is disappearing . 
  they 've got the pointy things on top of their head . 
  turkic yeah but hungarian not so much . 
  that is in the treatment of state wrt the citizens . 
  the state is secular meaning there is a strict separation between state and religion . 
  then again germany is not a secular state so i guess that 's why all these terms are weird and unusual , 
   if he 'd said yes , the story would be `` west midlands police force refuses to let muslim officers wear burqas and niqabs '' instead . 
  next they wo n't allow police officers to wear nazi garb and from then on it 's a slippery slope my friend . 
   the state is supposed to be indifferent to religion . 
  is n't the state the men and women working as state representatives ? 
  how can you ignore religion and still wear religion ? 
   http://www.ezglot.com/etymologies.php?l=ron&amp;l2=hun wow 45 words . 
  where one is n't even a word http://www.ezglot.com/words.php?l=ron&amp;w=%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%8d and a few are utter bullshit . 
  mustar comes from french moutard , locui comes from latin locus , mai from latin maius .
