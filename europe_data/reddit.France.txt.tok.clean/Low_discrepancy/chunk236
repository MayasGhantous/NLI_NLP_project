  that 's hardly significant . 
   sprinkle of turkish , hungarian huh ? 
   well , the french are restricted by limitations on free speech . 
  some things can be said in the us some thing can be said in us that can send you to jail in france , uk , germany , spain , italy , canada , denmark etc etc etc. 
   that may have been true before the advent of high-speed internet and modern telecom fast internet does n't mean shit when the ecb is closed and people are asleep . 
   the big banks in london have been constantly talking about moving their offices to the continent but their clearing to nyc when brexit happens . 
  i love when in a single comment someone shows how ignorant they are . 
  and well ** you are clueless ** . 
  banks do not own clearing houses . 
  banks do not have clearing house offices , banks can not move shit . 
  no bank has commented on they moving clearing houses . 
  clearing houses not being part of active banks is an essential part of their activity since they act like a money mover between banks . 
  why are you commenting on shit you do n't know with complete confidence ? 
  well for its global business , london might still keep that activity ( or it might go to ny or nj , singapore who knows . 
  but for european business , london obviously is no longer a good place for us europeans . 
  you guys made the decision to no longer sell services to us . 
  ps : you can also point out that china must be an amazing place to put your factory since so many are there while ignoring the massive amounts of pollution happening . 
  and here we ignore the amount of frauds ( libor scandal ) or other types of illegal activities . 
  bigger is n't always better , 
   better define better ? 
  is the british bankerss association massive slip ups that lead to libor fixing and massive global cheating one of those `` better '' things ? 
   wow someone sounds desperate . 
  indeed . 
  claiming that clearing houses will move to nyc is ridiculous . 
  clearing houses need strong ties to the emitters of the currency they 're dealing with because of their nature of handling a lot of money . 
  they wo n't move in a place with 6h difference in time . 
  it would render the system completely disjointed . 
  not to mention the pressures the ecb will put on them . 
  well neither you , nor any dude on / r/europe controls what happens on a country/continent level . 
   put someone more realist in charge because uk voting out was the realist choice that is favorable to uk 's economy . 
  suuuuuuure . 
   alstom has been sold off to ge . 
  alstom trains has not been sold . 
  stfu if you do n't know shit . 
   arianespace 64 % owned by france , 20 % by germany . 
  not multinational at all . 
   whereas in france , they build stops for high speed trains outside and have local trains carry passengers to the cities that 's for tgv stations of somewhat smaller cities like macon , aix and others , so they can stop quickly and fly off . 
  bigger cities like marseille , bordeaux , strasbourg , lille have their station in the city centers . 
  what 's with the retarded flair ? 
  now if you speak with all the slavic origin words , you sound like a moldavian . 
   why are we # 2 you like buttstuff huh ? 
  testosterone issue ? 
  yeah . 
  sarcasm ya know :p, 
  i spelled money instead of monkey . 
  no wonder you could n't spot the difference . 
  corrected . 
  no child left behind . 
   nothing will happen except in an article in forbes , the heads of renault and peugeot said that due to the new restriction , they 'll start to phase out diesel engines from b class cars ( hatchbacks and the like which are very popular in the eu ) . 
  what a god send , considering the industry has [ bribed docs ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2016/03/15/michel-aubier-un-pneumologue-qui-ne-crache-pas-sur-le-diesel_1439826 ) to say that diesel is harmless when it is absolutely terrible for city environments . 
  if in 2025 we wo n't have paris as polluted as is , the usa wo n't be for nothing in that . 
  and we should also thank the most representative of americans / u/executivemonkey . 
  i mean you get 50 % of the seats with 37 % of the popular vote . 
  and the party with 12 % of the vote gets 2 seats out of 650 . 
   the small poor countries in eu said the guy from a rich country , 
   is far from terrible . 
  it is n't great either . 
  we 're not particularly sad uk left and our politicians are n't particularly comforting . 
  that need n't be so . 
  we can have stable systems like spain , italy or belgium . 
  or highly representative ones like uk . 
  there 's switzerland but i do n't think we 're there , really . 
  parlamentary system only works if it 's a biparty country . 
  if not , it 's just weird . 
  yeah i am not surprised . 
  only time i saw a dude doing it in public was when i visited rome . 
   who 'll make the french pay for it . 
  the brits are paying for it . 
  it 's not a country 's business to keep people ** in ** but to keep people ** out ** . 
  we 're just doing business . 
   i do n't know what you 're planning , i only know what you already did . 
  & nbsp ;  has the government force well this shows you know jackshit . 
  it was n't the national police that did that . 
  but the municipal police of nice . 
   france is heading in that direction what direction ? 
  the one where the ** supreme court ** said it 's illegal to do that ? 
  mkay . 
  dude sorry you sound super clueless . 
   yes . 
  that 's the law no it 's not . 
   are you denying the experiences of these women are you saying we 're planning on putting a yellow crescent on women that wear the head veil ? 
  can you point me to what project of law that is ? 
  thank you . 
  because if not , then that 's just the ramblings of a paranoid person . 
  exactly !, 
  who started it ? 
   two women met at the tournament and one won . 
  a couple of decades ago a man would have won . 
  : / we 've made progress , 
  and they say chess is n't a real sport . 
  they have a women 's section for crying out loud . 
  knight beats the bishop . 
  queen goes down on pawn . 
  we have to continue to face the challenges put before us with a stiff upper lip . 
   no , i just understand what the relationship between the state and the media in a free society should be . 
  well you understand wrongly . 
  politicians will always make remarks about the media and on they conduct business [ here 's obama about fox ] ( http://video.foxnews.com/v/4233970482001/obama-takes-jab-at-fox-news-over-portrayal-of-poverty/?#sp=show-clips ) . 
  we can take any politician and i can assure you he will have made comments about the press . 
   applying that logic to an argument between individuals is ridiculous . 
  thats why you can go to / r/france where they comment on this issue https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/51dwym/french_pm_blasts_ny_times_for_false_picture_of/ the top comment with 78 votes says :  il a raison pour une fois .
