  translation : he is right for once . 
   in the end , everyone here is just making a personal value judgement . 
  yes , except in this whole story valls represents the french people who agree with him . 
  i do n't represent no french besides myself and you represent 0 french people . 
   if you have free press , everything is acceptable by default , and only factual corrections have to be made . 
  i 'll end this convo because you start sounding like a spoiled brat that refuses to understand the concept of `` representation but i 'll leave you with what obama said about fox :  if media is operating basically as a talk radio format , then that 's one thing , and if it 's operating as a news outlet , then that 's another, 
   political message . 
  and with my voting power in french elections i approve of the message valls said . 
  i grated him that authority . 
  you as a foreigner have * 0 * influence on what french politicians should and should not say . 
  valls does not represent you as you are not part of the french people . 
  so continue making claims on how politicians should behave . 
  it has * 0 * value here in france . 
  and as a representative of the french people , valls is in the right to comment when an article is pure bs . 
   that kind of reaction to media writing is inappropriate . 
  do you have any voting power to determine what valls shoudl and should not say ? 
  the trust me , valls does n't give a shit about what you think . 
  valls was commenting on that nyc article . 
  so basically you 're commenting while being uninformed . 
  bravo . 
   it 's not the business of the state to determine whether what media writes is acceptable or not , it 's the business of the consumers . 
  it is not ** your ** business to comment on what ** our ** ( read the french people 's ) politicians are commenting about . 
   is the only country til belgium is not a country . 
  boy you 're ignorant so i wo n't bother reading the rest of your comments . 
   i wonder how valls feels about isis 's recent anti-burqa stance as well ? 
  ca n't be good for him . 
  the burqa bans dates from 2010 since when sarko was president and fillon pm . 
  also it is ** not ** a burqa ban but a face covering ban for security reasons . 
  since isis is also banning it for security reasons ... well shows we 're not paranoid , 
   , but to criticize the times for publishing an accurate representation of how muslim women feel seems ridiculous . 
  * a ) feeling are subjective , you can not be accurate or objective about them . 
  some were utterly ridiculous . 
  `` they 'll force us to wear a yellow crescent '' . 
  ** you 're friggin wearing a headscarf by your own friggin self ** . 
  * b ) they said they received 1500 mails but only published a handful . 
  why not the full thing if you wan na be accurate . 
  why a select few ? 
  * c ) there are 4m muslims , so about 2 million muslim women . 
  only 15 or so comments were published . 
  it is ** not ** a  representation of how muslim women feel just a select group who bothered to answer . 
  the journalistic value of what times did is the equivalent of taking comments from reddit and posting it on your paper . 
  yes what can be more french than a buttery croissant, 
  did you read the nytimes article ? 
  full of comments on how life is unbearable for muslim women . 
  how they get spat on day in day out in public transport . 
  how they expect that 'll have to wear the a yellow crescent like the jews so people can identify them more easily as muslims ( the fact she wears a headscarf identifying her as muslim is lost on her ) , how they should get asylum in the us because of how oppressed they are . 
  valls as a representative of the state called them out . 
  land the plane and send him out with a burka, 
  it 's awful . 
  it 's cheesy , it 's soapy , makes me cringe just thinking of it . 
  sounds like a 1 man boy band from the 90s . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlcvfjwl78 this one gave me cancer and i stopped listening . 
   just stop finger pointing and i will stop too . 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about and i 'll leave you alone now . 
  cheers . 
   and not even the braging or the whole thing about the colonialsim . 
  a lot of regions in france have gotten or will get a referendum for independence . 
   and nobody can change it . 
  and nobody would dare to change it . 
  got ta break some eggs to not get nuked by russia . 
   i doubt french have better infrastucture , you doubt correctly . 
  because the best parts of the us are the fly-over states . 
  villa medicis is french owned ? 
  til . 
  also hollande is prince ... of andorra . 
   nothing to do with disinformation . 
  ** when the obama administration says that no civilians have been killed in drone strikes : that 's disinformation ** . 
   obama admit that illegal mass surveillance was taking place and said things would change did things change ? 
  in 2012 the elysee was bugged by nsa . 
  i will stop here because this is ridiculous and i have no time to deal with propagandists . 
  good day . 
   how much of the us budget went into that concentrated effort ? 
  neither you nor i have those numbers so it 's ridiculous to make any claims based on `` beliefs '' . 
   bush and co you mean the president of the united stated of america , the vice-president , the cia . 
   obama certainly does n't do disinformation . 
  do we have the number of civilians killed by drones ? 
  because according to the white house if you 're a male over 14 or 16 you will be classified as a combattant . 
  see the obama administration  [ nearly for the past year there has n't been a single collateral death ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/07/201172612395401691.html ) when the civilian kill rate is about [ 4-35 % ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/asia/12drones.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) in the best of cases . 
  we can continue the bs the obama administration in the mass surveillance scandals , in the guantanamo scandal , in hiding of info on the involvement of saudis on 9/11 . 
  it 's extremely hypocritical to claim that ** russia ** disinforms while when talking about the us , it 's ** just bush and cheney ** . 
   put almost no resources at all . 
  there was a concentrated effort in trying to depict that iraq did have weapons of mass destruction even though evidence pointed to the contrary . 
   is not state-sponsored . 
  it 's one thing for a movie director to make the conscious decision of choosing an actor yes because hollywood did n't suffer from mccarthyism ... tell me more . 
   you confuse propaganda with disinformation . 
  yeah the us did that to cause the iraq war . 
  luckly reddit helps out https://np.reddit.com/r/politicaldiscussion/comments/50xqdt/how_come_cheney_had_so_much_power_as_vp_why_did/d78gdpa?context=3, 
  is uk affected because they 're part of the anglo-saxon sphere or something ? 
  they invented reasons . 
   `` sent with this sealed heavy bag here wear this nice vest with tons of tubes . 
   ecj did you just confuse the echr and the ecj ? 
  dude wtf are you talking about ? 
  concerning the echr  they have no enforcement power whatsoever yeah i 'll also ignore that comment because you sound super clueless . 
  go read a bit more on european courts and we 'll talk some more . 
   pakistan and afghanistan insignificant http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html, 
  they scouted the area first . 
  about 4 were parisians , one was a former paris bus driver . 
  and they all spoke french . 
  the 2 foreign ones from irak just blew themselves up in empty streets . 
   you mean a problem about the ones both arab ** and ** sunni connectors are important .
