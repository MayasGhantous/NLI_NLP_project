   there are turks and turkics among the isis by the way . 
  like any comment involving human behaviour , it is ** never ** at 100 % accuracy . 
  but by and large it applies . 
   because the echr says so ? 
  yes france has to respect the international treaties it signed . 
  because this is n't a muslim problem . 
  isis is an arab and sunni issue . 
  that 's why turks do n't give a shit about isis or indian muslims . 
  the caliphat has 0 importance to anyone besides them . 
  the echr would shut that down on the spot . 
  this shows that refugee sleeper cells is kinda silly . 
  you need locals to pull off a big terrorist attack . 
  a bunch of refugees will run around like headless chickens . 
   that set off a stampede . 
  that 's a bunch of crock https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/40nru4/dear_europeans_what_are_the_most_astonishing_or/cywinxb heck . 
  all those images of refugees stuck in hungary were from the summer of 2015 . 
  you are missing the point . 
  http://www.france24.com/en/20120706-police-lose-automatic-power-detain-illegal-immigrants-france-court we can not arrest illegal immigrants . 
  it only makes sense . 
  you send them to jail for not having the right to be on your soil . 
  then what ? 
  you keep them in jail indefinitely ? 
  do you let them stay in jail only for a limited amount of time ? 
  them what ? 
  they do n't become legal after that . 
  you can either deport them ... which is n't possible because they have no id and you do n't know where they came from . 
  so again no bueno . 
  or you can look at eu law . 
  where do these people come from ? 
  italy . 
  congrats according to dublin agreements means they have to apply for asylum where they landed first in the eu . 
  but dublin is a sham . 
  or you actually implement border controls , meaning schengen becomes pointless . 
  stop pretending there 's some magical easy solution . 
  there is n't . 
  shinning light on the matter is a good thing though . 
  just like the french restaurant owner that did n't want muslims in his place . 
  or the fact that asians are targeted in paris because if their perceived wealth . 
  name and shame !, 
   do you really need to use racist terms here ? 
  should we gloss over all the horrible things we 've done because it hurts our feelings ? 
  the russian will attack through alaska ? 
  / u/executivemonkey is funnier :( also helps that he 's american so you know he 's actually exceptional . 
   if the politicans of a country had anything to do with tax decision making do n't you think ? 
  wait what ? 
  taxes are political . 
  raise the taxes . 
  lower the taxes . 
  that 's always a campaign promise for someone . 
  let 's start taxing this , let 's stop taxing that . 
  i thought that would be the super right track for them ? 
   2016 you delta , i 'm a lambda you poor excuse for a rho.with an attitude like yours , not even etas will look at you . 
  these really made me think ... about how unfunny they are . 
  typical beta . 
  man 's got ta man . 
  it is the 3rd largest party . 
  either way , the udhr is not international law or anything . 
  it 's just a guide so it 's pointless to use as a defence . 
  your graph simply shows that crony capitalism is ** worse ** that communism . 
  also all your graphs also ignore what happened before 1960 as we can see that the gap between the us and the ussr was much larger . 
  heck even during mao 's cultural revolution , life expectancy drastically increased . 
  http://www.china-profile.com/data/fig_wpp2008_l0_1.htm again higher than india which we can fairly say it 's crony capitalism . 
  ** conclusion ** : crony capitalism < communism < american capitalism < social capitalism . 
  with that i 'll end this convo cuz i 'm tired of shit slinging, 
   estonian life expectancy shot up very rapidly after the communism fell this communism fell in 1996 in estonia ? 
  yup . 
  you can see that in 1996ish , estonian life expectancy was lower than in 1960 , there was a severe decrease after communism fell . 
  do you not find that interesting ? 
  or how life expectancy was in the ussr in the 60 early 70s was only 8 months lower than the one in the us . 
  it drastically shot up before the 60s then it severly declined . 
  how life expectancy in countries with universal health care is higher than in the us for example ? 
  https://www.google.fr/search?q=life+expectancy+france&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=hgrmv_tmems7azughqgh are these not lessons to learn about socialism , social democratic countries , full blown capitalism etc ? 
   one of the worst features of centrally controlled planned economy well romania in 1990 by all intented purposes and up to the end of 1990 was a controlled economy with state fixed prices . 
  * shrug *, 
  dublin is pointless at this point in time and it is woefully incapable of dealing with the current crisis . 
  one of those eu things that was really half assed and not really throught through like the euro and schengen . 
  res -  ignore, 
   you get vat . 
  holy fuck . 
  vat is something ** i pay ** . 
  not apple or any company . 
  they do n't pay vat . 
  how can one not know that ? 
   i dont know what you want here . 
  money because they use eu infrastructure , eu stability provided by militaries etc. 
   it 's a real warning , a threat of sorts . 
  give me the right to reduce worker benefits and worker immigration to my country or else . 
   but that sort of thing was gone in countries like poland by 1990 already . 
  well the economy still could n't have recovered in time . 
  romania for example experienced a maidan type event , factories ( so means of production ) were still state owed , so where the lands . 
  claiming it was a free economy is a very strenuous thing to claim . 
  especially since romania removed pricing control only in ** october of 1990 . 
  shame all the important fighting is happening in desert regions . 
   straightforward language does n't may have the same type of language ( admittedly towards british citizens ) when saying that brexit will be foxused on reducing immigration therefore exiting the single market ? 
   france getting played by a russian pawn france never liked to be the us pawn and we do n't play well in being russia 's . 
  we prefer the 3rd way ... which means at times our interests can come into disagreement or agreement with one or the other . 
   they had free market , free market in romania in 1990 , good one , 
   there had gotten rid of these distortions by 1990 . 
  yes but they do need to jump back to their normal state which does n't happen in 3 months . 
  heck these countries had to deal with establishing ownership of land and properties .
