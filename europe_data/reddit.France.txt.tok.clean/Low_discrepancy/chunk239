  these can take a looong looong time . 
  also dealing with the thorny issue of ownership of things build during communism : factories and such . 
  which also took a long time . 
  dude , do n't bother . 
  these types of heated debates usually revolve around shit slinging , shit posting , insulting , avoiding the debates or actually thinking hard on the matter . 
  people play the `` race card '' ( argument from authority ) well i lived in communism or came from a communist country so i know * everything * about this . 
  which is actually a biased view . 
  100 % capitalism , 100 % communism , 100 % socialism do show their limitations and positive things did come from communism or socialism . 
  most can agree free ( almost free education ) is a good think , universal healthcare . 
   1995 ( i was a teenager ) , and it seemed that the difference between them and us was enormous . 
  the same could have been said though about visiting moscow or east germany in that period of time . 
  romania was n't at all your typical communist country anymore than north korea is . 
   what metrics would be better for evaluating the quality of life ? 
  how about life expectancy ? 
  well one was coming from being a massive empire ... the other from a foolish quest of paying off debt that only empoverished everyone else . 
  well this seems like a more reasonable comment even if it comes from a rep srpska flair because it actually addresses the issues . 
  maybe the decision of it being anti-constitutional is indeed correct but that simply points at the fact that it is a very flawed constitution . 
  that points to very deep problems about that country . 
  then the conversation stops here . 
  cheers . 
   allow state funded mosques ( from the french state ) sowwy secular state . 
  : / i will not change my state and my values because of 10 retarded people   especially when no one has blown themselves up in either of the two balkan countries yes . 
  they do n't matter . 
  that 's why . 
  that 's why countries with very very small muslim minorities like us , uk , france , spain have seen major terrorist attacks . 
  those countries ** matter ** . 
  only countries that see terrorist attacks are those either going through a civil war or those that matter . 
  so france should strive to reduce its muslim minority because thrn it will have fewer isis fighters ? 
  you thought of that and that makes sense to you ? 
  why do n't you look at numbers for turkey bud ? 
  nothing is more awesome than being taught by some old bastad that really just wants to go home, 
   i have n't heard any european muslim practicing it , https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/06/female-genital-mutilation-foreign-crime-common-uk, 
  i 'm sure you know a few . 
  next time you give winks about terrorist attacks that happen in france , you will know to expect a reply  do n't start shit , if you do n't like shit , powerpuff . 
  talk shit get hit , you know . 
  meanwhile thank you for your kind pm filled with insults http://imgur.com/a/ffhly i 'll let you continue stalking my comment history . 
  thank you for your attention , sweet child . 
   p.s worry about the hundreds of thousands of homegrown terrorists in your own country first millions actually . 
  we 're all terrorists  http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html france sent 18/million to isis . 
  albania ** 46 ** . 
  bosnia ** 92 ** per million . 
  so yeah you can talk to me about terrorism , because you 're fucking experts at it . 
   it so coincides with the day of st stephen so as to further exclude those of other religions from the celebration uhm . 
  catholics and others also celebrate st stephen . 
  boxing day , in moselle-alsace , in germany . 
  they celebrate st stephen . 
  boxing day is a big thing . 
   hence why the supreme court has ruled it to be unconstitutional . 
  so you guys do n't celebrate xmas or easter because muslims also do n't celebrate it ? 
   hey , sufferers of the armenian genocide  `` you got ta learn to move on man '' !, 
  i never heard any armenian claiming the turkish should n't celebrate ataturk because genocide . 
   and if those happen to be in my country and discriminate against the bosniaks and croats of my country , then i wo n't accept it . 
  so you do n't celebrate xmas , got it . 
   oh sorry , i forgot that was a requirement . 
  well again , you and / u/legba claim it is a celebration of genocide . 
  ** prove it **, 
  stop being so salty and so pity . 
  you have a lot to fix in your country cuz it 's fucking broken . 
  insulting people on the net wo n't fix how messed up it is , 
   it celebrates the genocide and ethnic cleansing of non-serb minorities from their homes to create republika srpska . 
  i thought it celebrates st stephen which many countries do already like uk or some parts of france , germany . 
  you got ta learn to move on man . 
  if they want their celebrations so be it . 
  you make your own and that 's it . 
  are they celebrating the day by chanting how many croats and bosniaks they killed ? 
   no one `` votes '' about joining the eu , unless you work in the european parliament . 
  that might change soon enough . 
  there are political parties that suggest voting . 
  and like it or not , you are petty . 
  no wonder you 're in the situation you are . 
   perhaps listen to what us who are actually from there have to say ? 
  i asked you if the serbians celebrate by chanting how many croats and bosniaks they killed ? 
  the friggin war did n't even start on the 9th of jan. 
   it 's like saying it 's also a christian thing since there are christians who are for this . 
  true that it 's related to religious beliefs but not to the religion itself . 
  it 's more about the `` morality '' . 
  what / u/anthropos-para is saying is that even though it 's not a practice that originated with islam , many islamic countries appropriated it and became intertwined . 
  there 's nothing in the koran about the burka , just like there 's nothing in the bible about cutting down trees and putting them in your house or that st nicholas gives gifts . 
  yet we still did it on xmas . 
  yeah you guys sound like the balkans . 
  i know i 'll vote agaist b&h from joining the eu . 
  we do n't need that bs . 
  if france and germany had behaved like you , the eu would not have existed . 
  well you sound non biased . 
  not at all . 
  once you have a hodgepodge state , that 's what you get and you have to live with it . 
  they celebrate that thing , you make you own celebration . 
  that 's life and everybody moves on . 
  had they asked for 2 months holiday or whatever , yeah that would be ridiculous but this is different . 
  are they celebrating by chanting how many croats and bosniaks they killed ? 
   and as such should be secular so you do n't have christmas off ? 
  or the 15th of august ? 
  muslims dont have the aid el fitr ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
   connecting the state to the religion , as is customary in orthodox tradition . 
  yeah catholics or muslims never did that . 
  it 's not like the pope got his own state and for 1000 + years rules western europe imposing his will on everybody else . 
  nope . 
  that ** never ** happened . 
  i think you are being ridiculous here and you 're letting your own bias show .
