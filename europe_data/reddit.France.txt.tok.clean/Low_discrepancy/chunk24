  and i just flip out . 
  i go on a 1 minute rant about useless his story is , how he 's making us lose his time and our time with pointless stories when he could be talking about friggin airbus and friggin planes which are nice things with tons of interesting facts and technical points that would have been interesting for us engineers to be . 
  i still get mad thinking about it . 
  well we just caught one guy that had 5 aks , 1 kilo of explosives , 100 grams of tatp ... oh they 've all been to syria of course but they 're running free around france and europe . 
  why ? 
  do n't ask me ... 
   which is not permitted under international law . '', 
  that 's false . 
  http://m.20minutes.fr/societe/1760211-20160105-decheance-nationalite-si-souhaite-france-pourrait-creer-apatrides  remove it from only dual-citizenship people if you are naturalised , you can have it stripped for you if you 've been french for 10 years of less . 
   france has n't ratified it thank you . 
    practically , most terrorists will not have a second citizenship if they have a french citizenship . 
  and that 's a bad thing because ? 
  help me out here man . 
   but i would n't call our beaches shitty . 
  costinesti is crappy and crowded , eforie nord was crowded and decrepit with shortening beaches ( they have to bring in sand because the sea was eroding them ) , i guess mamaia 's okayish . 
  and then you have the [ sea algaes ] ( http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/digi24/actualitate/social/video+litoralul+romanesc+invadat+de+alge ) and you hope they remove them ... they never find the time to . 
  they 'd friggin pound music on the beaches instead of letting you relax and the friggin smell of kebabs . 
   naturally , any country can do what it wants , but countries that want to be part of the community ca n't go around making stateless citizens . 
  that 's not a thing ...  there are no precedents and common sense is not a valid principle of international law . 
  we removed the french citizenship for a couple of nazis back in the day . 
   nothing can compel another country to grant citizenship to an individual it considers an alien . 
  i 'm saying that if a person had both citizenship a and b and country a strips him of it , the person will still have citizenship b. 
   possibly of course , though if they were as subversive and effective as some would claim you would expect to see thousands of would be terrorists europe has sent a couple of thousand . 
  [ add 'em up ] ( https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/eh-ag559_eujiha_9u_20140928162409.jpg ) saudi arabia has send some 2000 isis members http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html looks like they ** are ** as effective ... 
   yeah , exactly , that would never have worked hence the pipe dream . 
  why ? 
   i 'm glad they decided against implementing it . 
  well yeah , but now the right and extreme right can shit on muslims all day long . 
  what a better situation ... 
  they did n't want to implement it because it was a lefting govt and it would have looked weird for them . 
  [ 85 % of french are in favor ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/12/30/selon-un-sondage-85-des-francais-sont-favorables-a-la-decheance-de-nationalite_4839945_1653578.html ) come new right wing govt and new terrorist attack and you 'll see a different result . 
   that 's a pretty bold statement , care to back it up with some international law or customary precedent ? 
  that a country can not refuse it 's own citizens ? 
  it 's common sense and definition of citizenship . 
   well they certainly did n't learn it in a school in pakistan did they in mosques from saudi arabia maybe ?

  22 c in august vs 24.8 c. compare your destination with [ nice ] ( http://www.seatemperature.org/europe/france/nice-june.htm ) . 
  if bearable bathing water is at 18c , then you now can swim from may to october . 
  compare that to your destination : june to sept. . that 's a full 2 added months . 
   i see murky water at your sandy beach too . 
  yes sandy beaches are more murky . 
  but in nice you get [ beautiful green wates ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/nice-seafront.jpg ) . 
  no where in romania can you get such a view .

  http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/01/04/decheance-de-nationalite-aucun-texte-international-empeche-france-rendre-personne-apatride_n_8911140.html  terrorists do n't really use their passport to cross borders that was n't the point . 
   all the motivations about welfare , or healthcare , or right to vote , etc. . . are already existing and can be stripped in justice . 
  sauce ? 
  right of vote yeah , but other rights i 'm not sure . 
   there was a logical `` we need to do something , anything '' popular reaction after the attacks . 
  what will happen now is that people will start shitting on the muslim population . 
  wait come election time ... 
  instead of penalising the terrorists , we 'll get to hear 100 more speeches on islam that will make the muslim population feels less of a part of society . 
  awesome ... cooler heads amirite ? 
   its our mess , not theirs . 
  yeah . 
  they became jihadists because they learnt it in our schools ... 
   i 'm sure there are , i just did n't find them in my travels .

   if you just want to swim in that murky water than often is way too cold ? 
   they could n't take it away from abdelsalam the project was to remove the citizenship even if they have only french . 
  second , there is nothing compelling a country taking a convicted terrorist from another country even if the second country stripped the citizenship of the terrorist . 
  in your example you were talking about pakistan . 
  if the guy is a pakistani citizen then pakistan has to take him . 
  does n't matter where he lived all his life . 
  also , australia can find countries to store their refugees , europe too would manage to find a country for some terries after they get out of jail ( due to old age ) . 
  we simply lack political will . 
   beaches ... 
  compared to the med , they 're pretty shit . 
  also there 're few opportunities in terms of urban tourism . 
   with a global competition for jobs , the whole premise of social democracy is over . 
  it 's not like you can compete for jobs in france or the us . 
  the reality is that those that growing in the polls , are because they talk about jobs and job security . 
  trump and his wall , merkel and her job security in germany , le pen in france . 
  why the left is suffering , the right is n't faring much better ... 
   `` hey pakistan , we stripped this guy of french citizenship because he 's a convicted terrorist , please take him back . 
  why ? 
  the abdeslam 's were 100 % french . 
  ask anyone and they 'll tell you that . 
  ask them how long the abdeslam 's lived in france : you 'll get the answer : 0 years . 
  salah was born in brussels . 
  but everyone agrees they 're french . 
  i am confused . 
  conquering constantinople and claiming you 're the new caesar , that 's right there in inventing history . 
   had the belgian nationality they sent them to their country of origin , netherlands ... no fucks given .
