  there 's a limit to everything . 
   maybe you would n't mind lepen winning . 
  i wo n't mind it . 
  just not gon na vote for her . 
   `` edgy '' at the expenses of dead and homeless people . 
  it 's not being edgy . 
  they did n't translate it in english or italian or anything . 
  they did n't shove it down italians ' throat . 
  it 's for their public . 
  if you wan na be offended , you are free . 
  but they 've been doing this since the 60s . 
  also after the nice attack one of the cartoonists there https://twitter.com/cocoboer/status/753892365061021696/photo/1, 
   i think nobody finds it funny i laughed . 
  it was so uncalled for , hence why it was so funny . 
  i am also split . 
  the ch one gave me an instand laugh because language . 
  the italian one took the trouble of redrawing the ch . 
  what to do , what to do ? 
  maybe ch cuz it 's more retarded and it 's so gratuitous ? 
   you want argue . 
  i want argue : s. hey do you gaelic or do you speak just english ? 
  fuck me , only [ 2 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_language ) are native speakers . 
  of your own friggin language  ) . 
  that 's just sad . 
   found this one just gross and to my surprise without any implicit meaning like people died let 's just mock it . 
  dark humour is n't for everybody but i laughed . 
  just like i laughed about some dumb jokes about nice even though it happened 200m from where i live . 
  * shrug *, 
   kindly get your shit together if you want argue . 
  me tarzan you jane . 
   i think its disgusting what happened the cypriot people welcome to defaulting . 
   ask the argentinians what they think . 
   believe it or not most irish people believe in the eu because we philosophically are pro united europe . 
  of course . 
  when you have your cake and eat it , you really love the eu . 
  we also brought peace to your nothern brethrens . 
  what 's the european project ? 
  fucking over other countries ? 
  the race to the bottom in terms of taxes ? 
  sucking off tim crook ? 
  tell me ... 
  i 'm curious . 
  ** stop being fucking greedy ** . 
   unlike your failed state . 
  said the guy from the country that was on the brink of defaulting . 
  you 'd be buying potatoes from uk without the eu . 
   those countries , and yours especially simply have poorly managed their economies for decades holy fuck and ireland is exceptionaly managed right ? 
  if sucking gafa cock is fine management ... 
   coming from a french person this comment is hilarious . 
  here 's something coming from a french . 
  you better pray le pen does n't win the elections  sadly she supports the death penalty so she 'll never get my vote until that changes but many do n't think that . 
  the eu can manage without france right ? 
  you 're big guys right ? 
  how about you take those 13 billion and buy greek debt if you believe so much in the european project , buddy ? 
  oh that 's right , you 're fucking hypocrites . 
  but do n't worry , it wo n't last forever . 
  we and the germans are part of a plan ? 
   these a private corporations mistakes bailed out by the state . 
  wow . 
  you are the only country i heard where the state bailed out private banks . 
  i can not think of any other country that did that '  normally when a company goes bankrupt , its tough shit for the bondholders and creditors . 
  and the people who have accounts  you love to mention cyprus . 
  do you know the banks took money from the clients ? 
  go ahead , make your own irip party if the eu was so bad and awful to you . 
  tell us how it goes  and your `` vanity '' projects is a bunch of bs . 
  did italy have vanity projects ? 
  romania ? 
  france ? 
  your level of national debt is about the same as ours . 
  your gdp and gnp is over the roof . 
  stop bitching , you 're living the good life . 
  you 're not greece or portugal . 
  this entitled attitude is getting quite annoying . 
  well thank you for calling us [ methodical ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/systematic ) . 
  quite unusual to be called that for a latin country but still nice to hear , 
  is n't it ** your ** debt ? 
   systematic i 'm not sure you know what that word means . 
  no kidding !, 
  i 'm not talking about ireland though , 
   i mean the banking crisis debt ireland was forced to take on . 
  * sigh * not ** this ** again . 
   indirectly that leads to the downfall of your own country though , if all the skilled people leave for germany then the france economy will sink and seriously damage the country as a whole . 
  whereas if all the money goes to apple , then wtf will happen ? 
  do we all become apple engineers ? 
  you think apple will graciously donate the money to france ? 
  does apple run poor people canteens cuz germany does . 
   ~ ~ access to the ~ ~ eu ** consumers ** fed ~ ~ was a huge part of the ~ ~ the celtic tiger ~ ~ 's success . ~ ~ god giveth but god can taketh away , 
   their was * there * was . 
  if you 'll be the second country in the eu that has english as an official language , you got ta play the part man . 
   also need to be kept in check in regards to the national sovereignty . 
  so maybe we should vote anti-eu parties into power ? 
  if only le pen were anti death penalty because sometimes one can not help but think something is rotten in the kingdom of eu . 
  there needs to be a reset because we 're the bitch of multinationals . 
  i 'd rather be the bitch of germany or some other country because that means i can move there if things sour up here . 
  i ca n't more applania because that country does n't exist . 
   the pay down the bank debt is n't that your debt ? 
   what i find most worryingly is how many people here on / r/europe just assume the commission , and vestager in particular , is working for `` justice '' , and is inherently `` good '' . 
  what you should really worry about it the amount of anti-eu parties on the rise ... eu fed the celtic tiger . 
   well , in germany , belgium ( at least in the flemish part ) and netherlands pretty much everybody speaks fluent english nobody wants to live in a cocoon . 
  all those countries , once you live a few cities become less and less fluent in english .
