  we have this wonderful idea of giving important positions to people simply based on succeding a few exams . 
  not let them rise through the ranks , no . 
  it might have worked in the 19th century but anne and her x billion euro debt has shown us it is a bad idea . 
   inspecteur des finances , sciences po , ena , then so is hollande a technocrat ? 
  he was an auditor for the cour des comptes , he did sciences po and ena . 
   banquier d'affaires how 's that a technocrat ? 
  at most he received a master 's degree in econ , and was given 2 cushy jobs . 
  i 'm sure we can find much better in term of technocracy . 
  at least someone with a phd and 2-3 articles published . 
   ireland is a tax haven , it 's in the eu . 
  did you miss the apple decision that was just handed ? 
  how about the fact that another big tax haven , uk will leave . 
   `` if we have a trade agreement then we literally can not do anything about tax evasion '' so besides not bothering to check the news you also can not read . 
  i am simply stating that ttip is not worth the hassle . 
  if we need a 0.3 % gdp hike , we have other possibilities . 
   he 's a pure technocrat a pure what ? 
  in what area ? 
   because its well past time that france had an \u00e9narque ? 
  well lets see . 
  there 's hollande , before that royal almost got in , chirac was one , then vge . 
  nope i think we 've had tons of macrons up to now . 
  i saved this comment . 
  i hope you wo n't cringe too hard in may when you 'll reread it : /, 
   used to be a lot worse i 've been told . 
   it is still an improvement no it 's not when you realise that that 0.3 % is actually the gdp and not the gnp and when you have all major companies that manage to produce wonderfully optimised fiscality . 
  our efforts are better spent elsewhere . 
  and lets not talk about the huge amount of compromises . 
   the only reason there is a fuss here is that ireland is getting cash that would otherwise end up in the pockets of other eu states and the us . 
  i mean you are free to follow your nothern brethrens and leave . 
  i am sure apple is in ireland because it is such a vibrant market . 
  every irish probably buys 5 ipads per year . 
   blame the enablers offering them this deal . 
  yeah . 
  apple was just minding its business , shooting the breeze in cali when this once in a lifetime offer fell in their laps . 
   something traditional far-right parties would never be . 
  yeah except marine never said she 'll repeal the gay marriage law and you also ignore that the second most important person in the party , philippot is gay . 
   also , if anyone was doubting she is literally hitler . 
  yes . 
  literally . 
  first the kippah then the extermination camps . 
   though i seriously doubt ttip will only grow the european economy by 0.3 % ( i 've read it could be somewhere between 1-3 % ) , no . 
  the average across the eu is 0.5 % . 
  some countries like ireland might get a boost of 1.3 % but others like hungary will see just a 0.1 % bump . 
   this is still a good boost for the economy it 's so insignificant , you can hardly call it a boost . 
  more of a bump . 
   and will cement eu-us relations . 
  because nafta really cemented those us-mexico relations . 
  sometimes good fences make for good neighbours, 
  he got killed twice ? 
  he already saw this news a few days ago . 
  so you do mean  cologne institute for economic research ( iw ) * sigh * . 
  a simple google search will show you that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cologne_institute_for_economic_research is ** not cologne university ** . 
  it is a * private think tank * . 
  here 's where they talk about themselves on their website https://www.iwkoeln.de/en/institute/mission-statement . 
  * the cologne institute for economic research ( iw ) is the private economic research institute in germany . 
  also * we believe in germany 's socially responsible ** free market economy ** . 
  we are advocates of a ** liberal economic ** and social order . 
  i 'd prefer if you were to change in your comment where you said it 's the cologne university . 
  it 's just a private think tank that advocates free trade and liberal economic policies . 
  so not exactly impartial people . 
  thank you . 
   you said it was better to ignore ttip and create a trade agreement on tax havens i said that ttip is n't worth the hassle and i gave you a different venue where we can do much more good than here . 
  again 7 billion * gdp * is nothing . 
  not to mention that the gnp and the actual benefits your average frenchman would see would actually be much lower thanks again to tax havens . 
   i said there was no reason both could n't be worked on . 
  we do not have an infinity of negociators around . 
  it has been a pointless treaty from the get go . 
   because of an impossible-to-achieve agreement you 'd prefer to have instead . 
  yes , i 'd rather not deal with a country that favors tax havens . 
  that doesn '' t make one more trustworthy . 
  obviously you do not have any expertise in striking , revolting and the likes . 
  no , we 're talking about tax havens . 
  delaware is one of them . 
   tax haven fighting treaty . 
  so the us will shut down delaware ? 
   colonge university is n't conspiring where did you quote the cologne university ? 
   that 's because the people are idiots and frequently vote against their own interests in deference to populism . 
  in france the estimated gdp growth is 0.3 % . 
  that 's 7 billion . 
  tax fraud meanwhile costs us about 60 billion . 
  fighting tax heavens would be so so so much more beneficial that this treaty . 
  also prices would only maybe decrease by 0.1 % . 
  let 's fucking stop calling ttip the money treaty that will make everybody a new wallstreet millionnaire . 
   this unsubstantiated hysteria against ttip i do n't get the unsubstantiated euphoria regarding ttip . 
  france 's gdp will only increase by 0.3 % . 
  that 's 7 billion euros . 
  meanwhile tax fraud costs france ** 60 ** billion euros . 
  a 10 % reduction in fraud would have about the same impact as this turd . 
  and prices * might * decrease by 0.1 % .

  it 's an electoral year . 
  the hard reforms ( loi travail ) to pass were pushed quickly * before * the vacation . 
  now valls is pretending to be a socialist , macron pretends he is n't part of this govt and well ttip has to pass asap . 
  and that wo n't happen ... 
  til afghanistan is a first world country . 
  no they 're not . 
  they need for it to pass before 2017 and the general elections . 
  and since that obviously wo n't happen , since they 've been negotiating since 2013 , it 's time to call it a day . 
  and they ca n't play any type of silly strategy because the nsa is spying on their every conversation :p, 
   the point is that they expect everybody to welcome them well this is taking time .
