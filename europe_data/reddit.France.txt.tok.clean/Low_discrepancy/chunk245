  * sigh * . 
  again these are ** different ** people more often than not . 
  those that you meet shouting for acceptance are those already in your country . 
  those that do n't really give a fuck are in ** their ** country . 
  see the difference ? 
  kinda like how brits living in france are remainers while uk voted to leave . 
  you do n't hear me shout : fuck 'em all cuz they 're just a bunch of european hating special snowflakes . 
   the us closest the us has for the eu immigrant issue is that of southern central america bypassing mexico to end up in the us and even then that population ends up being a net gain well that 's also probably due to your geography . 
  you 've got a heap ton of fucking place over there . 
  over here immigrants usually land in urban areas . 
  this leads to a rise in housing and since everything is more expensive in cities they need to be much more productive than an immigrant living in podunk in order to produce a net gain . 
  they almost form the majority in that racist country called france : /, 
   this is the one of the problems with this country , nobody thinks that refugees are valuable when they can make our country richer so your new financial capital will switch from milan to lampedusa ? 
  well am pleased we 're topping the who `` gives a rat 's ass '', 
   eastern europeans ( including ones on this sub ) hate diversity , but as soon as the uk wants to reduce immigration , they insult the uk for being xenophobic . 
  ever heard of the word demographic ? 
  i know i know it 's great but bear with me . 
  it could simply be that there 's two demographics in the same country . 
  one that wants to leave and be accepted and one that wants to stay, 
   civilization happens in multi-cultural cities , not redneck filled swamps . 
  ** correlation does not imply causation ** . 
  repeat after me that mantra . 
  the reason multicultural places like silicon valley , london or ny seem so awesome and diverse is because they have a massive stash of money and they can absorb a fuckton of resources . 
  if you put your average mississippi podunk and add your shitty indian village and add some south american favela you wo n't magically produce a new silicon valley . 
  also they 're not that diverse . 
  how many women engineers do gafa hire ? 
  but heykeep chugging the kool aid, 
  exactly . 
  i can say that sweden gave us assemble yourself furniture . 
  everybody has a shameful spot in their history or culture . 
  we should n't let that define us . 
  ethnic germans and ethnic austrians and ethnic italians but no ethnic south tyroleans huh ? 
   also , saying that 80 % of romanians listen to `` gypsy music '' is downright retarded , considering most romanians despise that kind of music . 
  gypsy music is n't manele . 
  gypsy music is similar to what bregovic or kusturica play . 
   calling someone a manelist is almost an insult here . 
  yes romanians have many weird insults , e.g. 
  the disdain for seasonal agricultural workers in spain . 
  it 's almost like they despise people who make an honest living working hard . 
  also talking about ethnic romanians as a unitary bloc is a bit weird considering that 300-400 years ago the concept of romanian did n't even exist . 
  just 3 different voivodships that would kinda speak the same language but were often at war with each other and would raid each other and try to impose rulers on each other . 
  considering that they do n't have a common history until recently ( read 150 years ) it 's kinda grand talking about `` romanian ethnicity '' . 
  but , sadly , ceausescu 's national-communism took its toll on history education and produced these myths . 
  * i avoided talking about all the other groups of turkish ( pechenegs or cumans ) or slavic migrants that had an immense beneficial impact on the medieval voivodships in order to keep it simple . 
  eh , we 'll swap our syrians for your latin americans . 
  she 's at it again http://www.euronews.com/2016/08/28/uk-to-scrap-human-rights-act, 
  quality comment yet again . 
  you amaze us kiddo . 
  we 'll tell the argies to send some exocets your way , 
  quality comment right there . 
  must be your trademark, 
  we have to know at what angle she squated so we can find out then if her genitalia or asshole were showing . 
   funnily enough it is done all the time to undocumented workers in the uk ; detention pending deportation . 
  yes many weird things happen in uk but not in france ** or europe ** http://www.france24.com/en/20120706-police-lose-automatic-power-detain-illegal-immigrants-france-court, 
   ( the perpetrator has no legal reason not to cooperate with identification they burnt their passports and they are free to claim they 're from syria . 
  i 'll stop here cuz we 're going in fucking circles . 
  that changes everything : o, 
  holy shit merkel performed a lazarus on romanians : o, 
   you would arrest them for refusing to cooperate with identification . 
  omg dude . 
  how many times does one have to tell you that you can not do that ? 
   you are detaining them based on the fact they are not allowed in the country . 
  that 's the thing . 
  you ca n't do that . 
   how do you know that their home country poses a risk to their well being ? 
  you do n't know anything about them . 
   in fact , you do n't need to even deport them back to their home , you should be deporting them back to the country they entered france from italy , congrats that solved all the problems . 
   , why has your government not detained them until they reveal where they can be deported to ? 
  i am having the same convo with / u/havejoystick but you people refuse to understand . 
  again it is illegal to detain illegal immigrants based only on the fact that they have no id . 
  it is also illegal to deport to * countries where they risk their well being * countries that they do n't belong to . 
  so there you go , you are stuck . 
  this is why your mighty pm , may wants to leave the echr because of all those pesky human rights that means you ca n't deport or arrest someone willy nilly, 
   should n't just be negative about a proposed solution but have a better one . 
  this is n't a problem that can be solved with some elbow juice and some grit . 
  there are ** legal ** issues that need to be considered . 
  but your random redditor on / r/europe cares not . 
  he wants things done pronto . 
  well it does n't work like that . 
  look at fucking australia having to close their detention centers . 
  look at the us and their 11 million illegal immigrants . 
  i really doubt there 's a solution here on this thread where people do n't even bother to google 2-3 laws . 
   second of all , get a court order , and if they are in contempt , lock them up . 
  and they say they 're from syria . 
  now what ? 
  you deport them to a war zone ? 
   first of all , laws can be changed . 
  well we 've finally come full circle . 
  the legislation is based on an international , eu , echr and national laws . 
  what you refuse to understand is that it 's not a simple issue to solve . 
  but hey go on pretending the solution can be found in a reddit forum and that you 've got it . 
   what is your solution to this problem , if i may ask ? 
  did i say i have one ? 
  it 's just that the random redditor that is shooting the breeze and saying well you just got ta do x , y and z and it 'll all be fine is just being your regular arm chair expert . 
  this is a complicated legal problem . 
  i am confused how people think this is n't the case ? 
  that 's fine and dandy but these people do n't want to apply in france . 
  so again , you do n't know where they 're from . 
  and his answer is just shit posting that does not address the problems of this issue . 
   that is when you imprison them .
