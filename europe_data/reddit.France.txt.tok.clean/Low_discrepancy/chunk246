  ** on what fucking charges ? 
  ** an illegal immigrant ** can not ** be fucking arrested because they do n't have papers . 
  it 's in the fucking article i just sent you . 
  here 's more : http://www.france24.com/en/20120706-police-lose-automatic-power-detain-illegal-immigrants-france-court, 
   look at bulgaria yes bulgaria is faking being bad . 
  france on the other hand is genuinly bad . 
  poverty , unemployment and we 're a bunch of islamophobes . 
  you can try to tunnel to iceland . 
  you might get a few * good * football players , 
   lawful imprisonment again in europe you can not detain someone because they do n't have their papers see here : https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/case-watch-european-victory-immigrants-rights http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=c-61/11 so no , it is not `` lawful '' imprisonment . 
   you should probably at least try to understand what you are talking about . 
   you can lock them up for how long ? 
  again those pesky human rights saying you can not detain someone indefinitely : / but hey , you brits wont have to deal with hr for too long :d, 
   i think that the us is taking the right action given its position here . 
  i doubt many people on / r/europe will think that the us is doing the * wrong * action by severely limitating the number of syrian refugees they accept . 
   and i think that the `` germany intentionally set off a flood of illegal immigrants into the eu because merkel said ` come on in ' story really is n't all that accurate '' . 
  it might have exacerbated things slightly , but the migrant flow was already underway . 
  no , but merkel 's current policy of pushing the acceptation of refugees on other countries is clearly ** the wrong ** thing to do . 
  also there was no concertation on how to deal with the refugee crisis . 
  germany was basically acting alone a ) when they decided to let in more and more people . 
  b ) when they decided to negociate with turkey . 
  but it 's hard for germany to do something comparable . 
  like it or not , the severe limitations that orban imposed did reduce the number of refugees flowing into germany . 
  think of it as a domino effect . 
  once hungary blocked the refugees from entering , serbia said oh fuck i 'll be stuck with refugees so they start blocking too and it propagates that way . 
  if germany says neah it 's okay let 'em in , no one will attempt to stem the issue but hey not my problem . 
  we see the same in calais . 
  how many times do i have to explain to you that your pm is not running for anything . 
  with the muslims it 's full-on cartoon villain time for a shitton of people , because they 've never met one in their lives . 
  yeah ... no . 
  gypsies are the cartoonish thieves that ca n't wait to pickpocket you . 
   pudeur would i think be translated as ~ ~ in ~ ~ decency . 
  nope . 
  pissed off parents cuz a woman flashed her vagina at their 10 yo kid . 
  why does n't the us more aggressively accepts syrian refugees ? 
  you 'd have to be pretty ignorant to not see that they did play a big role in destabilising the whole region . 
  they 're not dumb and they only accept those very highly vetted people . 
  here ladies and gentlemen we see the redditor in his natural habitat of shit posting and arm chair specialist in all and every domains . 
  jack of all trades , master of none . 
   i do n't see how that is relevant you 're talking about `` the democratic '' aspect . 
  and i 'm telling you its bullshit . 
  signed in 1985 , put in place in 1995 ( 1999 ) . 
  sangatte the first jungle started in 1999/2000 . 
  17 years is hardly `` always '' . 
   but there were always migrants at calais , no they started to come about the time schengen began . 
  it became much more easy to cross the continent . 
  instead 2-3 borders to cross you just have one . 
   deporting them . 
  to where ? 
  there 's a pesky thing called ecdh ( which may declared more than once that she wants to leave ) which forbids random deportations to random countries . 
  human rights ... damn youuuuu !, 
   whence they came where did they come from ? 
   blocking some one did you vote for cameron ? 
  or may ? 
  did you see their names on your ballot and said ok these guys . 
  yup i want them . 
  or merkel ? 
  is her name on ballots ? 
  so why are you talking to me about democracy ? 
  at least i know who the leader of my country is for the next 5 years , did you know it would be may ? 
  also only 36 % of brits voted for the conservatives but they got 50 % of the seats ... so again lets not talk about democracy ? 
  when was the last time you voted on the maximum number of terms ? 
  again it forces to change political generations and bring in new blood . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  i doubt copying th\u00e9 while book covers educational purposes . 
  heck it 's a friggin educational book . 
  that 's what its purpose is . 
  or toilet paper . 
  again in a normal system , the president prepares a apprentice if you will to carry on her legacy . 
  it happened with de gaulle and pompidou , chirac and villepin . 
  like it or not your messiah president will die at a certain point in time . 
  so you do need someone after them . 
  neah . 
  it was because they were gypsies . 
   a court ruling on friday overturned france 's controversial burkini ban on civil liberties grounds , but some local authorities have vowed to keep it in place . 
  yes because only the ruling involved only one town . 
  the others have no obligation as of yet to change . 
  it 's not like turkey where mass purges are a thing you guys love but i 'm trying to explain the thing as clearly as i can . 
  : /  i genuinely never heard of similar stuff happening in europe . 
  i 'm serious especially towards muslim women yet both events targeted them it 's bizarre ... 
  i wo n't bother googling racist events in other countries because doing so is ** extremely retarded ** and i do n't spend my time googling random events , unlike you apparently since you 're hooked on non important events . 
  * shrug *, 
   banning specific swimwear in beaches not again with that . 
  god almighty . 
  go read the news and get back to us . 
   refusing to serve to muslim women ... 
  yes . 
  one crazy restaurant out of how many in france ? 
  i do n't know we have a lot . 
   all of them came from france . 
  yeah i wo n't argue with ignorant people mainly cuz there 's waaay too many of you guys on the internet and fuck me , who has time for that , right ? 
   he caught them with photocopies of his book i 'd fail those students simply on the fact of `` how friggin dumb do you have to be ? '', 
  average wage grows faster and commodities prices decrease thanks to free trade and competition . 
  yeah . 
  and we know how fair the compettion is when poland absolutely refuses to reform posted workers rules . 
   when they need to buy that product , it 's artificially more expensive than it should be . 
  what are the social conditions for an italian worker vs an american ? 
  because it sounds like social dumping if you let countries where workers can work their asses off with little to no protections , paid vacations etc and tell them to compete with countries that offer better working conditions . 
  cheaper is n't always better . 
  while an italian worker wo n't be able to afford a ferrari , he 'll still get 30 days of paid vacation , maternity leave etc.
