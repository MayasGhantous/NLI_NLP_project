   you 're effectively paying to let people play at having a job if that job at only exists because of protectionism , at harm to the average consumer . 
  welcome to a social democracy , where the poorest do need a sort of protection system . 
  remove that , and it will suck for everybody . 
  worse than erdogan . 
   sure but we keep hearing weird stuff unheard of in europe from france in these days . 
  yeah , [ unheard of ] ( http://www.comiteactionpalestine.org/word/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/affiche-ici-on-noie-les-algeriens1-750x400.jpg ) . 
  dude do you freak out every time a minor crappy thing happens ? 
  because you being from turkey i can imagine you had a couple dozen heart attacks these past few years . 
  are metaphors too complicated for you ? 
  every major political leader usually produces an heir in some form or another . 
  it 's they 're apprentice that goes on to continue the vision . 
  currently what vision is germany producing ? 
  because on the outside , it seems very dull . 
   that syrian refugees do n't love family members who are also refugees . 
  * facepalm *, 
   or are tenuous links suddenly preferable instead ? 
  did you give me any actual proof or did you show me post migratory data ? 
  because that 's what your link shows . 
  here 's actual data before the crisis : http://siteresources.worldbank.org/intmena/resources/sf_background-1.pdf 2005 : 11 % of syrians living abroad went to germany and 8 % went to france . 
  9.3 % in sweden . 
  in 2000 there were 13k living in germany . 
  10k in france . 
  during the crisis germany received 400k syrians while france says it 'll try to attract 20k . 
  hopefully . 
  maybe . 
  clearly the whole `` family already established '' is bull shit . 
  same thing . 
   do you have evidence that shows that there is in fact an established syrian community in romania that the refugees ought to be happy to join ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabs_in_romania about half a million arabs from lebanon , syria , jordan studied in romania in the 80s . 
  also many things `` make sense '' . 
  but i want proof . 
  there is no best man for the job of head of state . 
  that 's a myth . 
   they are way more likely to make decisions that make a short term positive impact rather than looking at the big picture . 
  looking at obama and his interviews i think it 's a good thing . 
  he was honest for example on the ukraine issue . 
  there will never be an us intervention . 
  someone always worried about getting reelected does n't really make for a great leader . 
  poll ruling is n't a great way to steer a country . 
  and your issue still stands if the pm decides to not run at the next elections . 
  if you have so much money , go for it . 
  but that 's usually not the case . 
  and i only hear people bitching about nato, 
  because humans have a finite life but the job they occupy has near infinity time horizon . 
  passing down your crown is inevitable . 
  who is merkel 's heir ? 
  okay this is going off the tracks from the original issue . 
  cheers . 
  you 're not exactly electing someone for an internship here . 
  plus with less pressure , they tend to be more off the cuff and more honesty on their part . 
  instead of trying to reach 2 % spending on on their military , cees should try to reach 2 % on r&d . they might also not need to always buy military tech from bigger countries . 
  if they fulfill the conditions to stay , congratz . 
  if not , sorry son . 
   by migrating nomads do you mean `` barbarians at the gate '' are you triggered or something ? 
  can i invade your country ? 
  oh i 'll bring french culture which is much more prominent than macedonian . 
  it 's because she 's a pm . 
  that 's why i prefer presidential systems . 
  at least there 's a limit . 
  the pres can be jesus on earth or satan but he 's forced on the way out and they 're forced to produce an heir ( if politically savvy ), 
  we 're talking about war refugees here . 
  unless you want them to be treated like migrants . 
  then you should realise that resisting migrating nomads is also natural to human nature . 
  i think you misunderstand the concept of refugee . 
  i 'll explain it to you : war breaks in country . 
  you as a civilian have a high risk of dying . 
  you flee in safer country . 
  war ends in your country . 
  you return . 
  it 's not complicated . 
  your comment confuses me as it shows exactly the point presented for estonia ( a poor country ) 8/24 . 
  for france a richer country 26/388 . 
  did i miss something ? 
  help me out here , because it clearly shows that they prefer richer countries to poor ones . 
  ** also ** it does n't answer my question : do you have statistics of people that ** actually have ** family there ? 
   syrians are far more likely to have family in rich countries like germany , because those are the countries that will have attracted syrian immigrants before the war . 
  do you have any statistics on how those that refused ** actually had ** family already settled in germany before the war ? 
  whats the homeopathic treatment for earthquakes ? 
  a bump on the shoulder ? 
  nothing more broken than the reps, 
  flair up bubba . 
  how about fining them till they stop ? 
  holy shit what a stupid clickbait article . 
  this is in the friggin article : it was ** a made up story ** . 
  he admitted he invented the fact that he got beaten because he wore a cross . 
  close it down !, 
  yeah . 
  we could like built privately funded prisons . 
  right ? 
   where does his viewpoints differ from sarkozy , his only quality ca n't be well i have n't been president so you do n't know if i will be competent or not you 'd be surprised :d . i mean they 're all classical right wing politicians but jupp\u00e9 seems less inclined to go on rants than sarkozy , a little bit more moderate . 
  sarkozy plays the extreme right card a bit too much . 
  he still talks about identity , assimilation , now he 's full on anti-burkini . 
  jupp\u00e9 talks about integration , he does n't want a law against the burkini . 
  also jupp\u00e9 said from the beginning he does n't want to overturn the gay marriage law . 
  sarkozy still maintains some doubts on the topic . 
  in many other areas they 're pretty much similar . 
   but why would he be a better candidate for the republicans . 
  at this point we 're just looking for least worse candidate . 
  :( sigh, 
  neah , think it 'll be jupp\u00e9 .
