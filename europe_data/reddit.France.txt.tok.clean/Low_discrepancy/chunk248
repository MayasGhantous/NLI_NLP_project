  place your bets !, 
  place your bets !, 
  well i 'm not dumb . 
  i 'll bet on le pen not winning : /, 
  luca is ump not fn . 
  france did see a number of iron guards ( or sympathisers ) fleeing romania once communism came ( eliade , cioran ) . 
  arnautu or luca ( though he lived and studied here ) are n't born in 06 . 
  finally the samples are too small to conclude . 
  now if marion turns out to have a romanian dad ... ps : weird how they say arnautu 's dad was born in romania though he 's from a village that was next to sofia . 
  dude , throw in croatia . 
  despite their comments on how balaton is totally like going to the sea , deep down they really want an actual beach with ships and stuff . 
  the amount of reparations hungary ows us for that would make the versailles treaty blush . 
  well we should for a new exit then ? 
  dexit maybe ? 
  place your bets !, 
   most of those towns are in the alpes-maritimes , and basically all of var and a few in bouches du rhone . 
  so the vast majority of the french riviera . 
   not with that attitude !, 
  turns out the burkini was also [ banned in calais ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/burkini#en_france_2 ), 
   about 30 towns ( all but one held by the right-wing , might i add ) , out of a total of well over 1000 coastal towns and cities . 
  in all fairness , those 30 represent probably 90 % of the french riviera one of the most important french summer destinations . 
  also more muslims live in paca ( though that includes marseille not affected by this ban ) than in the other costal regions where you can actually go to the beach aquitaine , languedoc , poitou charentes . 
  you ca n't actually go to the beach in npdc . 
  true , in the 89 case it was an advice and now it 's a decree . 
  but if you ask the conseil what they think about the 2004 law , they 'll comme into contradiction with their advice . 
  did n't fully read . 
  yeah / u/ourari is totally wrong . 
  that 's for security reasons . 
  totally different than this case ( they did try to paint it as a ban because of disturbance to public order but such a thing is ridiculous ), 
  now if i can only find a hungarian here ... 
   it will never happen , it has just been ruled anticonstitutional . 
  not really . 
  as / u/kek _ souchiens correctly pointed out in a different message , the same court that decided today also decided against a ban on wearing the veil in [ school in 1989 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/voile_islamique_dans_les_%c3%a9coles_en_france#jurisprudence_du_conseil_d.27.c3.89tat_.281989-2003.29 ) but in 2004 a law still passed . 
  so it is possible and probable that a national anti-burkini law might be presented in the parlament , might pass , but the echr will strike it down eventually . 
   was simply badly written and poorly thought out . 
  what do you expect from [ the son of former iron guards ? 
  ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/lionnel_luca ), 
  could n't france do something similar ? 
  our prisons are overcrowded at 70k people . 
  adding another 18k people wo n't help anyone . 
   lagarde lagarde . 
  she 's not the new ferrari . 
  [ 6000 fences ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagq_a-bkw8 ), 
   should n't they be shared symbols ? 
  hence the cossack . 
  fdr was nearly dying at the time . 
   back up churchills plan of dealing with ce you mean the [ percentage agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percentages_agreement ) ? 
  this sounds like wishful thinking, 
   i recall reading about them being in support . 
  everybody from hollande to sarkozy to jupp\u00e9 wants more cooperation but nobody wants a european army . 
  it would n't make sense . 
  french interests are in africa , eastern european interests are russia and germany does n't care about either ... 
   on how many heads here is a question of quality and not quantity . 
   do you really want a religious symbol on a european military uniform designed in the 21st century ? 
  european history is filled with such symbolism . 
  and armies do love their historic heritage . 
  ane they really love symbolism . 
  how do you convince people to march to their death if you do n't talk about higher values/symbols/heritage etc. 
  yeah . 
  turns out there 's no official definition of a burning . 
  who could have known . 
  who said anything about swimming here ? 
   these are reactionary politics . 
  it 's nice to remember that all this shit was started by the son of [ former fascists ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/lionnel_luca ), 
  congratulations , you described [ the burkini ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/burkini ), 
  this burkini wearing woman looks like she 's [ alone ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/image/2016/08/24/534x0/4987496_6_85dd_une-femme-vetue-d-une-tunique-et-d-un_a2bf89ed19f6c89b51a8759efdac0a31.jpg ), 
  it does n't mean that they 're not sexually oppressed . 
  you are sexually opressed , [ let me liberate you by forcibly taking your clothes off . 
  ] ( http://lemonde.fr/image/2016/08/24/534x0/4987496_6_85dd_une-femme-vetue-d-une-tunique-et-d-un_a2bf89ed19f6c89b51a8759efdac0a31.jpg ) that makes sense to you right ? 
   the burqa is cultural , not religious . 
  a burqa is not a fucking burkini . 
  a burkini is a full bathing suit with a head scarf . 
  omg the humanity !, 
  they can wear that clothing on the sidewalk 5m away but they ca n't once they hit the gravely beach ? 
  that is functionally retarded . 
   nobody should be allowed to leave the house dressed like that i 'm way more bothered by the chinese with their parasols . 
   segregating yourself from mainsteam they 're not segregating shit . 
  on the contrary they put their beach towels next to you . 
  it 's not like they 're all going to a corner of the beach where no one can go . 
  this allows one to mingle . 
   but surely you agree with the fact that the vast majority of women do not wear this out of free will ? 
  the women i see at the beach wearing this are just enjoying their time with their kids and husbands . 
  if they wan na be fully dressed , so be it . 
  not my problem . 
  those that are forced do n't even go to the beach since it is a sinful place . 
  yeah well people do n't forget that soon . 
  so playing the `` omg i am 100 % innocent and i never did anything bad and it 's always the fault of others '' is a distortion of historical reality and does not help the peace efforts . 
   petain exactly . 
  we do n't hide our horrors . 
  it happened . 
  sure france suffered more at the hands of germany but that we should move on without ignoring the past or playing the forever victim always innocent card . 
   we do n't want to kill serbs . 
  how about the ustase ? 
  well he did have to step down from being mayor . 
  the sacrifices one has to endure ... 
   do n't know how your supreme court it 's in the process for several courts, 
  you forgot the old people that drive dangerously, 
  it 's estrosi , what do you expect . 
  alpes maritimes is the florida of france . 
  i guess they do n't get the [ 6 hour work ~ ~ week ~ ~ day ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-introduces-six-hour-work-day-a6674646.html ) regular swedes get . ^ * ^ * yeah yeah i know it was bogus reporting but still :p,
