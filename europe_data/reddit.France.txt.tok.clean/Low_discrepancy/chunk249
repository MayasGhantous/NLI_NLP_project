  also i think it 's based on a model trying to predict future occurences . 
  it does n't say what happened in the past . 
  and it is also peak ground acceleration and not richter scale or smth like that ;, 
   people dont have opinions on earthquakes while that might be your take on this issue , i want to let everybody know that / u/low _ discrepancy disapproves of earthquakes . 
  they are bad for society . 
  you sound like an earthquake sympathiser and frankly that disgusts me . 
  people ** do ** have a strong opinion against them . 
  vote / u/low _ discrepancy in the next eu presidential elections . 
  he will ban earthquakes . 
   uk fought an uphill battle was it really ? 
  i remember when someone posted an album with traditional costumes and for france they put some couple from a mediaeval fair . 
   a kind of civic union which homosexuals may use if they wish . 
  so christians invented the word marriage ? 
  and they trademarketed it ? 
   he will refuse to marry you so marriage is forbidden for old people in poland ? 
  til . 
  http://www.geox.com/en/men/shoes/formal-shoes/#anchorback then they go higher in the 250 range for the most expensive . 
  the only shoes under 100 are these http://www.geox.com/en/men/shoes/slip-on/smart-curry-u64x2a02285c2021.html?cgid=men-shoes-slipon#start=6 and they 're 90 . 
   and they are not even expensive shoes . 
  til 150 euro shoes are n't expensive . 
  i mean look at your median income ppp per year man . 
   now tell me , would an article have the same effect ? 
  so we agree it 's just propaganda . 
  i am simply stating that your interpretation is n't valid . 
  people do n't need to be told to go out and live their lives ... because that 's what they 're doing . 
  the whole `` more people die in car crashes '' is used as a bullshit comparison to state that no harsh or urgent measures need to be taken because terrorism does n't ** really ** have an impact . 
  well guess what ... it does ... 
  why not write an article then about what you saw ? 
  why stage a photo ? 
   what they usually mean is that as a french person you should n't be afraid to go outside . 
  no one 's afraid to go anywhere . 
  go at the promenade in nice now . 
  full of people . 
  guys . 
  stop worrying about terrorism . 
  more people died in car crashes . 
  / s edit : because people seem to be confused , like it or not , when there 's a terrorist attack the country shuts down . 
  so if you have a 2 weeks vacation per year , you do n't want them to be spoilt by terrorists shutting down a country or planes being on strike ( i.e. 
  do n't take air france ) . 
  that 's why they 're more like outliers . 
  plot twist : / u/uhohspaghettios1963 is black . 
  well technically , nothing better than a severe health risk to deter people from coming to your place . 
  neah . 
  i never did like karabatic . 
  massive performance . 
  salty about lavillenie though . 
   initial inspiration was when i discovered , in 2014 , the work of the spanish architect ricardo bofill , especially his works in the outskirts of paris seems about right ... 
   this was over a long time ago . 
  aye https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/07/romanian-health-service-crisis-doctors-uk  `` there is a major crisis in romania when it comes to having enough doctors . 
  in 2011 there were 21,400 doctors working in romanian hospitals . 
  on 1 november 2013 there were only 14,400 , '' he said . 
  ouch . 
  dude , please take care of yourself cuz you really might not find any doc when you go to the hospital : / though why would competent people leave a successful country like romania ... who knows . 
   without basing them on anything . 
  you mean you no longer shit on the tracks in romania : o fml , how does the 21st century feel like ? 
  i love your projection but go easy on the salt . 
  not good for your blood pressure . 
  you do n't have many docs over there . 
  they 're all leaving your majestic country : /, 
   i 'm also an immigrant . . where from ? . 
  dude , i think you 're projecting a little bit too much  do n't get salty , you 're from a skidmark country and you were called on when you claimed to be much better than others . 
  why get pissed , look reality in the face . 
  hearing you speak , you sound like you 're from some uber developped region that does n't have trains where you shit on the tracks . 
   you 're the third one to cherry pick that comment saying the exact same thing and ignoring the rest . 
  * shrug * not my fault you write dumbass comments . 
  ps : are all those beggaring gypsies i constantly see everywhere , from moldova ? 
  cuz man ... would be nice if romania would take them back : /, 
  hungary is much more developped than romania   i 'll prepare myself for the economic boom . 
  when you are more an area that is not on the path of trade , no boom will happen and the region will be poor . 
  of course i 'm talking about romania here . 
  but inside romania , the same happens with moldova . 
  you 're the moldova ( more accurately though would be vaslui ) of europe . 
  how far is timisoara or cluj from a network of highways ? 
   their education and willingness to work ( ... moldova ) yeah it 's not like one of the largest university cities is in moldova , that has the oldest romanian univerity actually produces highly qualified people . 
  nope . 
  not at all . 
  and how many highways are there over there ? 
  but i guess the dumb circlejerk is stronk . 
  i 'd be less critical as you are , considering that romania is the moldova of europe . 
   ( i 'm looking at you , moldova ) how many highways are there connecting the second/third largest city in romania with the capital ? 
  since romania actually condemned such a manoeuvre , it 's highly possible that if those countries were n't willing to kiss so much soviet ass , then they would n't have invaded . 
  1968 europe was n't 1954 or 1945 europe . 
  i too have sisters ... * sigh * :(, 
  you do n't even read what ? 
  doing god 's work you are . 
  i am not ** that ** out of the loop . 
  i still know that on reddit you never read the articles . 
   revenge out of the loop : for what ? 
   yeah , france and germany are really piggybacking on america 's super-carriers and uk nuclear submarines yeah it 's not like france has nuclear subs or builds it 's own nuclear bombs . 
  dude , if you know shit , why talk ? 
  cultivate yourself . 
   also there could be proof but since the police decided to believe the dad there is n't that 's utter bullshit . 
  how many times does one have to explain to you : there was no official complaint filed against the father regarding rape . 
  the rest of your comment is just a diatribe that does n't mean shit in the eyes of the law . 
  do you understand innocent until proven guilty ? 
  that in penal cases the burden of proof rests on the prosecution ? 
  i do n't give a crap who the guy was , he could have been friggin hitler , but unless you have proof , he walks . 
  and even if he did it , there is a prescription delay of 10 years for rape cases . 
  that 's how the law works , if you wan na move to some nazi country go to saudi arabia . 
  ps i 'll stop replying to your comments from now on .
