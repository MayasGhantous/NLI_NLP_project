  i do n't know ...  i never said bukovina is or was historically within transylvania . 
  misunderstanding then on my part . 
   oppressed french minority sarcasm ? 
  did you know that in quebec , 8 % of of people are anglophones but there as many french as english speaking universities ? 
   `` historical principality '' / u/istencsaszar is right . 
  bukovina is n't historically part of transylvania by any measure . 
  it is the birth place of the moldovan voievodship . 
  dragos creates an region dependent on the hungarian crown . 
  bogdan 1st founded the independent voievodship of moldova and established the capital at baia . 
  ( now in bukovina ) . 
  https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/baia,_suceava in the 14th century the capital is at [ siret ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/siret ) still in bukovina . 
  in the 15th century ( and during steven the great 's reign ) it was at suceava . 
  i 'll let you guess where that is . 
  in fact during the medieval ages , * there was no * bukovina . 
  there was a highland country . 
  https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c8%9aara_de_sus bukovina is a term created by the austrians after the 1775 annexation but it is an integral part of moldova and moldavian history . 
  claiming it is a part of transylvannia makes no sense to anyone . 
  someone is following the great war channel i see , 
   yes popovici came up with this , , plan , that means it was not a plan suggested by any hungarians . 
  it was just a random dude trying to convince the powers that be that more autonomy is good . 
   , because we actually lived together for centuries yes , much love the hungarians gave you . 
  well write to cnbc and ask them why their quotes are wrong ... 
  you could n't make it work with the czechs , which are much more closer to you culturally . 
  what makes you think it would have with the hungarians ? 
   i am sure romanians and serbians would have different plans while the united states of austria was the brain child of a romanian , yeah romanians had different plans . 
  the hungarians were ( surprise ) massive nationalists that wanted to impose magyarization on the plebs . 
  uhm ... no :(, 
  if birmingham would go to pakistan then clichy-sous-bois would go to algeria . 
  because he 'll come home battle hardened and with more experience ? 
   thinks about clichy sous bois hey hey hey , what are suggesting there buddy ? 
   what you 've got are the folks in brussels , the euro institutions , ** imposing incredibly high standards with regard to personal privacy ** at the expense of what the national governments are still expected to do , which is keep their citizens alive . 
  ** he is saying that ** . 
   love struck idiot did love strike him over the head ? 
  drop it drop him on his head while he was a baby , cuz dayum . 
   real pantydropper . 
  how do you think they 'd forcibly feed you at guantanamo , ey ? 
  but would jesus give them 4k gaming ? 
  sauce ? 
  i do n't know . 
  it 's just so utterly frustrating . 
  i hate it when people gang up against one person but his slurred speeches simply make it impossible for me to pay any attention . 
  he is simply being the lowest common denominator ... sure fine it wins votes but by god it does ** not ** make for memorable speeches . 
  some were super cool though . 
   i 'll ignore the fact that u triggered me . 
  it 's fine . 
  really . 
  what 's a little piece of land that caused 2 world wars ? 
   yes . 
  but so what ? 
  what is your point ? 
  that you 're tied to us , not the other way round . 
  we bring more to the aerospace table . 
  jesus would tell us about paradise and how we would ascend to it . 
  fiscal paradise and it was good . 
  just saying either article in the comments in the title or your first comment inserting a line saying it 's the article . 
  people would pay attention to it . 
  thanks btw . 
   airane 5 was n't a purely french development . 
  vastly french . 
  engine was a vulcain 2 developed by snecma ( now part of safran ) . 
   and a large part of that is airbus , which is directly tied to us . 
  easy there friend . 
  you should remember that ariane 5 was developed by arianespace , a french company . 
  a lot the military aspects in rocket and missiles from airbus comes from matra . 
  and we also have one of the main jet engine manufacturers : safran ( that with ge made the most used engine : cfm ) . 
  what engines does germany make ? 
  and they can make up to 20 % of the price of a plane . 
  dude i think i told you before ( think it was a piece on transdniester republic ) : quote the article . 
  once again i read your comment thinking it 's about you and i thought darn you took those comments from the titan ceo really too heart . 
  perfect . 
  alsace has german under and the french is not fully correct . 
  yeah . 
  not at all triggered . 
  nope . 
  not at all ... 
   was looking for a studio , female , dutch . 
  i never checked the gender of my studios . 
  : / guess i 'm not that picky . 
  i guess the flemish do n't love you guys as much as you hopes . 
   it is actually growing hard everywhere in the world his channel is old . 
   called an idiot for something our ancestors have done for a thousand years well we know better now . 
  for thousands of years we thoughts astrology is important . 
  or whatever it 's superfluous . 
  we can do very well without religion , which was n't exactly a success since we decided for secular states . 
  christian values & # 8482 ; sounds like the fine bros meltdown though . 
  i suspect jesus 's channel will lose a lot of subscribers . 
  christian heritage sure . 
  here he was talking about xtian values . 
  there is n't a value that is unique to xtians . 
  ever heard of prayer , you heathen pagan ? 
  what would jesus do ? 
  unless people have easy access to contraceptives . 
  poor people aint dumb . 
  til mario 's mexican . 
  do n't get it , care to explain plz ? 
  / u/flying _ ugly_eagle has some ultra-nationalist beliefs . 
   if there were gypsy terrorist groups funded by a radical gypsy state , they would have picked among the gypsies . 
  so you 're saying muslims are a problem ? 
   i was a '' minority '' in a way there .
