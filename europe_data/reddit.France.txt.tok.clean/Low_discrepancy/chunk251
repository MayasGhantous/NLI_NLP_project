  let 's start a referendum on completely eliminating social benefits for all foreign citizens and workers :d hey it might get the ball running . 
  but i dont think so , sadly . 
  look at brexit ... it did n't get the ball running on other coutries leaving the eu : /, 
   hit by a truck ... yeah i 'm pretty rough in bed : /, 
   if georgians would not give this chance , the attack would happen anyway . 
  if ifs and buts were candy and nuts we 'd all have a merry christmas . 
   georgia attacked first . 
  that view is as popular here as saying han shot first . 
  that being said : the separatists did shell first ( and after a short ceasefire ) and it was the georgians that invaded first . 
  said the person that posted how may wants to improve relations with putin  any publicity is good publicity and being aware of something is better than being aware of nothing . 
  why ? 
  it 's the biggest event in the eu atm . 
  and it has an international impact . 
  so people are concerned . 
  i fail to see how that is a bad thing . 
   there are even people who only submit stories about the uk and they 're not even from/in the uk . 
  the audacity . 
  we all did . 
  your mom is a fine lady . 
  or like 140 iphones . 
  / r/justdoppel66maths, 
   free frenchmen did fight the nazis but there was only like 500 at the most what ? 
  where did you get those numbers ? 
  you ass doesnt count as a source . 
  [ 3k soldiers follower de gaulle in 1940 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_france#beginnings_of_the_free_french_forces ) in 1943 there were 10-20k in the resistance , without counting those that provided logistic support . 
  in 1944 , 100k , with numbers growing to 400k by october . 
   these are common known facts and those countries did n't try to revise history about it . 
  about edward ? 
  wan na go in the streets and ask your fellow brits how many know he was a nazi sympathiser ? 
  ah yes . 
  i meant the [ german american bund ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?moduleid=10005684 ) 25k members , 8000 that would enjoy wearing costumes and parading [ like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:german_american_bund_nywts.jpg )  nice bunch . 
   no one has shrugged off being murdered . 
   this is history . 
  history presents context . 
   french ss men for example yes . 
  11k people at its peak ... staggering numbers . 
  from a population of 40 million people . 
  let 's not exagerate numbers here and make it seem like 1 in 5 frenchmen were figting in the ss . 
  and we forget the fact that more than half of europe was under fascism or supporting nazi germany without even being conquered : italy , spain , bulgaria , romania , hungary . 
  ( not to mention the american nazi party or the fact that edward 8th was a nazi sympathiser ) . 
   but the picture painted today of heroic frenchmen resisting the nazis has been blown totally out of proportion and simply is n't true . 
  oh please , that 's just bullshit . 
  one of the most annoying insults you can hear is still calling someone collabo . 
  you 're not doing history any favours here . 
  you 're spinning concepts to match your beliefs . 
   worse crop of rape let 's wait for new years eve . 
  neah check where / u/ltburtreynolds is moderator . 
  i simply avoid the troll :p, 
   some of us have known this was a myth . 
  oh please . 
  it 's not like people cheered when the surrender was signed . 
  when you 're so badly conquered , that 's it ... end of game . 
  we saw it before when prussians for example participated in the napoleonic army . 
  also https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89puration_%c3%a0_la_lib%c3%a9ration_en_france 97000 condamnations for collaboration . 
  between 10000 and 11000 extrajudicial killing after the lib\u00e9ration ... 
   all of the people supported p\u00e9tain what were the alternatives back then ? 
  i 'd pass on that thank you very much . 
  if only you had gone to sunday school . 
  the photos in the bbc www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37003819 are the stuff nightmares are made of . 
  by watching a screen ? 
   well tell me if i 'm wrong but i 'm not sure it has much to do with the civilian deaths that europe suffered during ww2 that 's resulted in this kind of attitude towards the whole notion . 
  after all ww2 was not the first war by any means where france or other participants suffered horrible civilian causalities . 
  you also forget ww1 . 
  quite easy to find someone in france that lost a grandparent fighting in ww1 . 
   i think it has more to do with the long peace and the total lack of great power war since 1945 . 
  actually you might be right . 
  it 's not like the us rates are throught the rough . 
  only 44 % would declare being willing to fight for their country . 
  but i think the biggest reason would be : ** why ? ** . 
  we all have nukes , why would i need to lift my ass ? 
  why start a big war when you can be more prosperous by cooperating ? 
  the good ol' days of pillaging/colonialism are over . 
  yeah . 
  we can see what 100 motivated people can do when the blmers shut down parts of us cities ... 
   france simply does not have the resources to deal with this . 
  it 's also nice to point out that they were helped by the no borders people that guided them . 
   the entire concept of war is completely alien to so many of these people . 
  how many of us civilians died in wars in the last 200 years ( see i 'm generously letting you consider the american civil war ), 
  ok . can you provide the site where the offer was posted to ? 
   it definitely was n't a convention de stage . 
  so ... it was n't an internship . 
  can you provide for the website where such internships are advertised ? 
  thank you . 
   that 's one of the highest percentage of down votes i 've ever seen on a video . 
  go to top gear 's youtube channel . 
  blm is an * american * movement . 
  after brexit you 've seen quite a few brits wanting a tighter cooperation with the us . 
  sir . 
  i told you once , i told you twice . 
  this is tesco , we can not do anything about the royal family receiving a yearly salary . 
  we ca n't take that money in order to pay the 5p tax on plastic bags for every person in britain . 
  we simply do n't have that power . 
   but even these properties were obtained because they were royalty , not because they worked for them . 
  same goes for elisabeth yet i do n't see people complaining . 
   the rightful owner of all those castles and forests should be the romanian state . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  the communists took it from them , they should get their stuff back . 
  romania is a state of law with protectio ' of private property guaranteed by the constitution . 
  because of the properties the communists took from them ... 
   and when they did produce something the money was sent abroad .
