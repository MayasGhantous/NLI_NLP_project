  how so ? 
  the church was autocephalou since 1877 when romania obtained its independence . 
  doubt they 'd send money to the greeks just for shits and giggles ... and they also lost a ton o their land since cuza . 
  i find it amazing that even though there basically were no wars in romania between 1866 and 1914 ( except the independence war and the balkan wars which did n't really take place on romanian soil ) , romania was basically flat under charles 1 . 
  railroads were being built , industrials tycoons started to appear but i guess the trickle down is still a myth . 
  with a stable country and a long reign and still have such a flat curve when the west was becoming industrialised ... sheesh . 
  edit : well since / u/greyko was n't kind enough to provide some data , the population of romania went from 4.5 million to 7.5 in that time frame . 
  so probably the population growth could barely keep with with the modernisation of the country . 
   1855 ( wallachia ) / 1856 ( moldova ) . 
   for the next 80 years , basically , our ruling classes ( nobility/former nobility and romanian orthodox church ) : except that the agricultural reformed was done by cuza in 1866ish, 
  but can he steal airplane beams ? 
   at least contributed to the shooter killing himsel i am waiting for the bad part ... 
  but i only see positives here : /, 
  you did that ? 
  when ? 
  can i read a news paper clipping when you did that ? 
   would i trust them to defend the country if someone really wanted it ? 
  lol , nope . 
  do n't you have nukes and shit ? 
  well the community of white people wan na organise a pool party . 
  should we let them ? 
  also can i be racist if it 's just one day per year ? 
  again these women are free to go to the beach ** any friggin time they want ** wearing ** any friggin costume and head scarf ** they want . 
  yet ... here we are ... 
  we 're talking here about france . 
  and about the morality of not letting an 11 yo kid swim with his mom . 
   if she is willing to do that , then she should be treated like an adult . 
  its the same with the hijab . 
  if you do n't know what the situation is , do n't talk about it . 
  women enter fully clothed and with the hijab on public beaches . 
  ** no one forbids them ** . 
   they mean community as in the group that organized it . 
  if a group of white people wan na organise a party and forbid black people ... then such a thing should be illegal . 
  same goes here . 
  any boys from the age of 11 up are forbidden . 
   hang out with whoever you want at the disclosed location . 
  they are not hanging out with whom they want . 
  they remove any males from the age of 11 and up . 
  are you and / u/dassinjoe ok if i open a whites only pizza place ? 
  or a straight only pizza place ? 
  no because that 's just wrong . 
  if you can service an 11 yo girl you can fucking service an 11 yo boy . 
  they did n't even enter puberty for christ 's sake . 
   they 're hiring the place , let them wear rubber chickens on their heads for what difference it makes . 
  they can wear anything they want already on public beaches . 
  source : come to nice where plenty of women enter in the water fully clothed and with a head scarf ... and that 's just fine . 
  who gives a shit what you wear . 
  ** but ** the thing is they are forbiding any males from 11 and up . 
  so if you 're 11 and male , you can go fuck yourself . 
  your older sis and younger bro ... that 's ok they can come in . 
  they also forbade any male from the age of ** 11 ** up to enter . 
  so if you are 11 your older sister can go , your younger brother can go ... but you are fucked . 
  we strive to forget it exists . 
  the bavarians got paris . 
  now you know why they feel so `` special '', 
  huh ? 
  it 's just the reality that most europeans do n't understand why we should get new free trade deals . 
  the benefits seem to be marginal . 
  [ this is france !, 
  ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/913/758/a12.jpg ), 
  sorry :d i did n't mean to confuse you . 
  do n't worry , i vote with my wallet and my wallet always goes for delicious foie gras no matter what you think , 
  but according to / u/slashenbash 's link , it does n't taste as good . 
  so it 's basically a no go ... are we going to worry about a species of animals that could probably live [ without its head ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mike_the_headless_chicken ), 
  but i love that stat : /, 
  at the same time , everytime you commit an act , you commit it as an < insert religion  believer ? 
  does that mean that the pope rendered the comment `` the terrorists are not muslim '' false ? 
  they can hike up the prices and people will have to fork out . 
   from the fascist guerrilas for 12 years . 
  indeed one can not say that romania was liberated since romania at that time was fairly independent from nazi germany . 
  which is n't a great thing to say when you factor in how many romanian jews and gypsies were killed during that period . 
  the iasi progrom killed 13k people in 2 days . 
   easier deffo . 
  cuz u say so   and yes many people here think europe does n't want us . 
  do they ? 
  yeah . 
  we 're rolling the red carpet as we speak . 
   eh , the point was being away from the people you do n't want . 
  ah yes . 
  lem me read again tho  more and more i heard the question : so where do you think is better , canada or the us ? 
  and if there , which city ? 
  ** ( of course , europe does not want us . 
  ) ** europe . 
  you know the definition of europe ? 
  are all those people that wan na be expats such condescending dicks ? 
  because darn i 'm happy their plane will fly over us . 
   i was trying to say that getting tourist visa from those countries , i mean `` those '' countries , not europe as whole . 
  and how is getting a visa from canada or the us . 
   look at article 2 of the comment you replied . 
  yeah . 
  do you think those turks mingle in the neighbourhoods of the other turks  ? 
  do you think you walk down the street and people ask you who do you support in france or germany ? 
   what pretending ? 
  even getting tourist visa for those countries is hard , let alone immigration . 
  so for you it 's much harder to visit croatia than to visit canada ? 
  yeah deffo ... because you 're in the visa waiver program/s . 
  you guys do n't have to pretend europe is filled with turkish upper class hating people , if you simply wan na emigrate to the us or canada , 
  well you ca n't really estimate that ... 
  it 's a big what if and history does n't work well with what ifs . 
   it 's extremely hard to migrate to european countries ( especially germany and france ) unless you are political refugee .
