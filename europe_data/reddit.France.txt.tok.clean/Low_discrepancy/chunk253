  because the us and canada open their arms to young , poorly educated and nonqualified turks ? 
  til . 
  because if you 're smart , with a degree in something useful , ready to work ... 
  there 's of places in europe ready to accomodate for you . 
  c'mon man ... let 's not pretend europe 's tough on immigration ... 
   more and more i heard the question : so where do you think is better , canada or the us ? 
  and if there , which city ? 
  ( of course , europe does not want us . ), 
  so what country has the largest turkish diaspora ? 
  so basically you 're saying : gabe for president ? 
  my policy is to not talk to buffoons . 
  cheers . 
   it made no sense yes . 
  cuz communists are well known for their logical capabilities ... get real . 
   look at transilvania 's geography what about moldova and muntenia . 
  you know where ** 60 % ** of romanians lived and where the capitals were ? 
   this is a fact ... that you know jack about geography ? 
  yeah you proved it 's a fact . 
   let me remind you that the king was also the king under the pro-nazi antonescu government . 
  let me remind you that it was a dictatorship . 
  wtf do they teach you in schools nowadays . 
  here ya go , the 5th of september 1940 decree that gave him full powers . 
  http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/istorie/istorie1918-1940/13-15.htm some of his powers include being head of the army , naming he pm , and signing any international treaties . 
  between 14th of september 1940 and 14th of february 1941 the kingdom of romania is ** officially ** called the national legionary state ( as you can see it does n't have the name kingdom , michael has only a symbolic position ) . 
  on the 14th of january antonescu removed the legionaries and declares that all political activity is banned . 
  romania fully enters the antonescu dictatorial regime . 
  dude open a history book . 
  go to a library . 
  education is n't expensive in romania . 
   that was anti-communist propaganda and it does n't even make any sense apparently you know very little about how communism works . 
  the ultimate desire of a communist regime is to appear to have legitimacy . 
  look at the purges committed by the communists : from the former members of pnl , pntcd to people in the communist party like patrascanu . 
  they all went through trials in front of kangaroo courts ? 
  ( ana pauker would have gone through the same thing had not some unusual circumstances appear ) . 
  ** why ? 
  ** because communists are fighting to give the semblance of legitimacy . 
  in 46 and 48 general elections too place . 
  there was massive fraud and you can guess who won . 
  * why * make a fake election when you simply have full control ? 
  the official turn out rates were ** 87 % ** and ** 97 % ** . 
  why ? 
  the elections in 52 and 57 had turnout of ** 98.8 % ** . 
  the elections in 61 , 65 , 69 , 75 , 80 , 85 had turnout between ** 99.88 % ** and ** 99.99 % ** . 
  the wining party won every time with ** 97 % ** of the votes ? 
  why ? 
  because they wan na seem legitimate . 
  who was called the german ** democratic ** republic and people 's ** democratic ** republic of korea ? 
  west germany and south korea ? 
  why use the phony name ? 
   he is a disgusting coward and traitor and you 're an uncultivated prick . 
  so here we are . 
   they did n't need to `` beat the soviets '' , they only needed to hold them off long enough until they decided it was n't worth it to keep fighting with the romanians and focus on the germans instead dude ... did you see what the russians did to berliners ? 
  really stop ... you know jack about history . 
   romania had a mediocre military that outperformed expectations . 
  t not really ... 
  they were tasked with protecting the northern and southern flanks of the german 6th . 
  the russians focused especially on those parts and they broke , therefore encircling the 6th and we know it ended badly . 
  itt : op is super butthurt . 
  socialism also implies the existence of unions in order to try and even the balance of power between employer and employee . 
  could these people have unionised ? 
  slavery blocks people from leaving . 
  that 's kinda a false idea . 
  you could have bought your own freedom, 
   not in a time of political crisis they 're not . 
  you mean when democracy is most needed ? 
  yeah sounds like a good idea . 
  democracy is good only when the powers that be like it . 
  when they dont ... new system, 
  and not to mention that your assertion about the issue being undemocratic is your ` very ' subjective opinion . 
  mass arrests are undemocratic . 
  the vast majority of turkish in germany did not come through the political refugee route . 
   many of minorities from turkey went to europe ~ ~ in order to live as themselves without oppression ~ ~ because jobs were plentiful . 
  ftfy, 
  that specific climate is very undemocratic . 
  they live in a democracy , they should learn how it works . 
  enough blaiming the society if you end up being a dipshit . 
  you integrate if you so desire . 
  you stay in your clique if you do not wish to integrate . 
  only the deeply racist would turn down someone eager to learn more about the society they come from . 
  when did they add that flair ? 
  do n't remember it being there when it i joined the sub ... bonne id\u00e9e de ne pas leur parler de paca . 
   seeing as the only formal proof of one 's `` german-ness '' is having the german citizenship if you acquire a citizenship , you have to vow to respect the values , institutions of your adoptive country . 
  for those born with a citizenship , that vow is implicit . 
   you should n't really bathe in the rhine though , where i live they have warning signs everywhere yeah , you do * not * want to know what i did in the rhine when visiting strasbourg . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yearly ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shower, 
   what do you mean by `` dynamic '' ? 
  when you get go through the steps to acquire a new citizenship , you do so because you have the desire to become part of the new country , you vow to protect its institutions , constitution etc. 
  so yes it changes the dynamic . 
  yeah the second one :p . 
  yeah ... 
  but vw also put the angle of the steering wheel ... which you ca n't really defend in any shape or form . 
   with concerned `` citizens rushing '' to the air base to join the blockade . '', 
  ftfy, 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how any of it works . 
  if anything , official flags are probably fireproofed so the burning is way way less impressive ( youtube a video of a brit trying to burn the flag of the eu on the door of his shed . ), 
  oh ... my liver is being stabbed ... 
  this is the most peaceful i 've ever been . 
  dude , did you let religion clog your logic centers ? 
   what i mean by `` doing more '' is for example , romanian soldiers fighting alongside american forces in afghanistan , with their far inferior aro vehicles , that meant almost certain death if struck by a roadside ied .
