  it 's okay . 
  you 've got nothing to hide and you 're a good patriot . 
  ca n't we have our own nazis ? 
  terrorist catchers . 
  they catch terrorists  by saving all your data . 
  yup . 
   well dgse seem to depend on gchq so you 're very welcome . 
  neah dgse is happy to spy on us . 
  but thanks for you guys spying on us too . 
  it 's fun when stasi organisations meet up . 
  and it 's super fun when dumbasses use misguided patriotism to cheer on the govt fucking them right up in the ass , 
  dude , you 'd be in deep shit without the us . 
  the supply so much tech and resources . 
  heck where would your nuclear programming be without them ? 
  and thanks for spying on us on their behalf  really kind of you . 
  we all know how vital important uk was when solving the georgian crisis or the ukrainian one , 
  til gchq = = uk . 
   you mean the agency which was shown to cooperate with all the other eu spy agencies . 
  the nazis are n't bad . 
  they collaborated with the italians , french , polish , soviets . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm tired but darn your message is confusing . 
   we discussed your username . 
  okay ... now i see why you mentioned those financial districts . 
  i 'm still confused who discussed what with whom . 
   i do a lot of rent a think tank work . 
  it 's certainly not my personal skills that gets me hired . 
  unless you mean my intimidation and social analytical skills . 
  i ... am not sure [ what 's happening here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fokmjoa.jpg ), 
   it \u00b4 s several kilometers long . 
  it 's long because border controls . 
  you 're welcome , 
  huh ? 
  well he was also refused deportation because of his mental conditions but he was n't interned in an asylum ? 
  again major fuck ups all around ( like in france or belgium ) . 
  we still have a random person e ` tering schengen and no one seemed bothered ? 
  wtf ? 
  last time i 've checked bulgarie was n't in schengen . 
  what was he doing in schengen state ? 
   that 's blurred by the massive wealth inequality in turkey . 
  so you have a few massively rich people and massively many really poor people . 
  can you tell me then how it is a good thing to accept turkey ? 
  it seems like a sure fire way of having a ton of poor turkish immigrants in europe . 
   the gdp per capita ( ppp ) so ? 
  there 's still 78/79 million of you guys . 
  do you understand than in 3 years you 'll be larger than germany ? 
  and you 're poor . 
  the eu ca n't do anything to help you . 
  i 'm not sure what part you 're not understanding . 
  when romania and bulgaria were accepted , it was based on the idea that they 'll improve , not that they 'll always stay the same . 
  and they 'll improve through eu funds . 
  how many hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars would the eu have to dump in turkey to make it at least to the level of poland ? 
   founding member of the eu guess you missed that boat huh ? 
  holy fuck . 
  that 's retarded . 
  if they had deported him to bulgaria immediately as he set foot on german soil sure ( because he applied for asylum in bulgaria ) . 
  but after you accepted to analyse his documents : sorry guys he 's yours . 
  can i see \u00e0 source about him being deported to bulgaria after being refused asylum ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  why deport him to bulgaria after being denied asylum ? 
   firstly ` dumd ' informs your iq and mindset.what is the point of humiliation to people ? 
  it 's a figure of speech . 
  of course it means undereducated compared with the eu * but * there 's simply too many of you . 
  it 's not some great conspiracy against muslims or whatever . 
  every time i see people complaining why turkey is n't in the eu , i have to remind them that turkey 's economy is shit . 
  the median wage in turkey is * smaller * that in * any * [ eu country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) . 
  if turkey joins now it will be the * poorest * eu country . 
  also by 2020 turkey will surpass germany in population . 
  basically turkey is numerous , young , poor and ... dumb ( one of the lowest rates of [ higher education degrees in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment ) ) . 
  so it 's not exactly a catch and opportunity . 
   yes , it 's one of the first things it asks i suggest you stop downloading software from the people you see on / r/iamverysmart . 
   people from impoverished families in for example the us have an iq 13 points below average . 
  and teenagers that are religious have a 6 iq points difference compared to non-religious teenagers . 
  this difference is significant so i suggest we remove all religious teenagers from school . 
  i can take a lot of idiotic statistics like yours . 
  mexico has an iq of 87 while italy 102 . 
  clearly the mexicans should stop whatever they 're doing because they 're stupid . 
  ** never hire a mexican programmer **  software engineers because every programmer is a software engineer . 
   i 'm not talking about poor/rich reasons did you even follow the thread ? 
  we 're talking about ghettos in netherlands not sub-saharan africa . 
  dude i think you severely misunderstand what iq is . 
  i am confused . 
  when you install a c++ compiler , does it ask for your iq level ? 
  do you have ** any ** proof that people from poorer neighbourhoods can not code ? 
  by your logic people from poor countries like india , russia or romania have a distinct disadvantage at being coders . 
  you seem to not understand that + / - 5 iq points does n't mean your coding abilities will amount to nothing . 
  it 's not like they have friggin down 's syndrome . 
  the iq difference between friggin poor regions and rich regions is about the same as the iq difference between religious and non-religious people . 
  should we stop teaching religious people programming ? 
  dude you should recheck your logic capabilities because something does n't add up . 
  most of those studies are done in regions that suffer from poverty and not relative poverty which people in the ghettos from ? netherlands would suffer from . 
  and even if that 's real , do you go : oh you have lower iq , here 's a punching bag ... go at it . 
  or do you go : let 's train that brain of yours in order to develop some fun and useful skills . 
  you do n't need to have an iq over 180 to learn how to program or make some websites . 
  it 's not like programmers invent every day a fast fourier transform type algorithm . 
  it 's more of a skill , that can be taught to many people even children . 
  but i guess saying that they 're mentally handicapped helps justify people 's disinterest . 
  i think the already started using that in germany too . 
  problem youths are not the one with mental handicap . 
  he 's probbaly talking about people growing up in the proiects . 
   why would they want to do it ?
