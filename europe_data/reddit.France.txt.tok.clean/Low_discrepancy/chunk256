  for a brief , crappy explanation on futures you can see [ my previous comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ue1hy/pound_fall_to_hit_rollsroyce_by_2bn/d5p9unr ) . 
   but wo n't their loss on the currency dealings exactly match the windfall from the pound 's fall ? 
  i 'll use some numbers from this [ blomberg article ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-15/rolls-royce-may-rue-long-term-hedging-decision-as-pound-plunges ) the locked in a contract where they sell 1 dollar for 0.625 pounds . 
  but now it 's 1 dollar for 0.700 ( give or take ) . 
  do to the nature of futures , they have to pay to the other party ** now ** : 0.700-0 .625 = 0.075 pounds to the other party ( or 0.0725 * 1/0 .7 dollars , does n't matter ) . 
  it 's actual money they have to pay . 
  so it 's an actual loss . 
  had the dollar now been 0.500 pounds , they would have received 0.125 pounds . 
  they can not play around with the exchange rate because the have to sell that dollar for 0.625 pounds . 
  they did n't do anything wrong . 
  they simply entered a contract that says the exchange rate does n't change for them . 
  so it allows them to make plans easier . 
  they know that at the end of the contract they 'll receive 0.625 pounds for their dollar . 
  okay this requires me to explain to you what a futures is . 
  like you said it 's not a fixed rate . 
  it 's not like a strike in the case of a call/put . 
  it just expresses the fact that the market has expectations for the future . 
  the market knows how much a kilo of apples cost today , how much it will cost tomorrow , 3 months , 6 months , 9 , 1 year ... whatever . 
  so let 's take an example ( with zero interest rate ) . 
  say the market thinks that in 1 year a kilo of apples will cost 5 euros . 
  ( swiss apples , they 're expensive ) . 
  so today ( july 2016 ) a farmer f and a baker b enter the contract that f will sell b , 1 kg of apples in ** july 2017 ** ( the terminal ) for 5 euros . 
  okay done . 
  now both f and b have a certainty so it helps with planning . 
  the futures is built mark-to-market , it 's its nature ( and i 'll explain why later ) . 
  what does mark-to-market mean ? 
  well every day ( or at certain times , we 'll assume monthly ) both f and b check what the market thinks the price of apples will be on july 2017 ( which can evolve because we have more info : if we know an asteroid will hit the globe in june 2017 , then the price will be zero ) . 
  * say that in august 2016 , f and b check the price for july 2017 . 
  and the expected price changed from 5 euros to 6.3 euros . 
  * what will happen * : f will give b in august 2016 1.3 euros . 
  * say that in sept 2016 , the price goes from 6.3 euros to 5.9 euros . 
  then f will receive 0.4 euros from b. 
  ** so now b has 0.9 euros . 
  ** * say in from nov to june 2017 , the expected price does n't change . 
  so no cash exchanged between f and b. 
  we 're going from june 2017 to july 2017 . 
  what is the expected price for july 2017 when we 're in july 2017 ? 
  the spot price aka the price the market says . 
  let 's assume that it * still * did n't change and it 's 5.9 euros . 
  well b will give 5.9 euros to f and will receive 1 kilo of apples . 
  ** but ** you have to remember that f has give b previously a cumulated 0.9 euros . 
  so effectively b paid 5.9 and received back 0.9 = 5 euros . 
  by magic the price the market said in july 2016 . 
  so therefore f lost 0.9 euros . 
  f is now rr , and the apple is x billion dollars and the 0.9 euros is the 2 billion they lost . 
  #why ? 
  mark to market allows for tiny , incremental changes each day , instead of one huge cash flow on july 2017 . 
  this means the risk of not having money ( default ) is much reduced . 
  also futures are protected by the margin and it 's all controlled by clearing houses . 
  forward contracts are not loke that . 
   any `` loss '' will be in the sense of it not having had the windfall yeah it 's like you said . 
  they shorted futures on the dollar . 
  but i 'm confused by your `` loss '' concept . 
  they did lose money , they were basically like an us company trying to export to the uk after the pound fell . 
  it 's an actual loss . 
  because it 's not a complex hedge at all . 
  what rr does is it sells futures on the dollar . 
  here https://next.ftrandomword.com/content/dabb161c-7aab-11dd-adbe-000077b07658 ( remove randomword from link , / r/europe sucks ) . 
  they also go for really long timepositions : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-15/rolls-royce-may-rue-long-term-hedging-decision-as-pound-plunges basically what they do is say : in 3 years i 'll sell you 1 dollar at exchange rate ( usd to gdp ) x. 
  ( since rr sells engines in dollars , it has to unload those dollars into pounds ) . 
  so now the current exchange rate has gone down , it means that they 're selling still at the former price , so they receive less money than they normally would receive . 
  futures ( unlike forwards ) are marked to market . 
  meaning every day you have to settle your accounts with the other party through clearing houses . 
  you compare the negative aspects of war on drugs with banning of guns . 
  they 're not at all comparable . 
  you can not put in the same bag people who buys guns and those who buy drugs . 
  people can get addicted to drugs , but have n't seen many addicted to guns . 
   we do n't abandon privacy of correspondence how do you know the post office does n't keep a trace of all the mail you received ? 
  what do slices imply ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  do you misunderstand the term * temporary * ? 
  sakine cans\u0131z , co-founder of pkk . 
   from your point of view it should be a perk !, 
  a perk that countries like germany and france also chose to pass on for a period of time of 7 years ... 
  and any eu state can say no !, 
   if an is dude in greece kills people and flees to turkey and it is shown that in greece said person will suffer torture , then no , no extradition . 
  that 's why france gave asylum to that kurdish chick the police tortured . 
   it 's not a privilege granted to non members . 
  i think norway and switzerland can also apply \u00e0 break if th\u00e9 situation demandes it . 
  so i really think you got this wrong . 
  if they abide by the single market rules , then they have the right to be in the single market . 
  it just makes sense and it 's good for everybody . 
  and they should have the right to pull the 7 year break because other countries did so . 
  again * it 's temporary * . 
  yes we still have efta . 
  and the world did n't crumble ... crumble .
