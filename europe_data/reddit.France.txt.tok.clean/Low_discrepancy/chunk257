  uhm what ? 
  that 's a risk in any situation . 
  it can happen with ceta , it can happen basically with any free trade deal . 
  yet here we are ... still passing free trade deals ... 
  sounds like a ridiculous situation that can see any country banned from free trade deals . 
  because in 7 years , uk will go to the status of norway . 
  which is good for the eu , good for british remain and leavers would just discovered they got screwed ... 
  i fail to see how people miss the whole ** temporary ** aspect of the deal ? 
  western countries pulled the emergency break before , when then 10 and the 2 joined . 
  what 's so special this time ? 
   no more special status it 's not a special status . 
  the provisions already exist . 
  since they were already applied . 
   without freedom of movement . 
  for 7 years . 
  after it goes back to normal . 
   the east is disproportionately profiting from free movement . 
  you do realise that romania lst 1/4th of its doctors . 
  ** qualified ** people that went to work in the west . 
  how is it a sweetheart deal ? 
  the uk deleted all of the benefits from being in the eu , still has to put up with all the `` downsides '' and they 'll just get 7 years where they can control * new * immigrants . 
  how can people not realise that those that are the most screwed over are the leavers . 
  exactly . 
  people are freaking out for anything . 
  in 7 years uk will be part of the single market and people will have freedom of movement . 
  leavers just managed to eliminate all the benefits of being in the eu with the only advantage is curving immigration for 7 years . 
  after the charlie hebdo attacks , what he had to say was : `` if you insult my mother , i 'll punch you '' . 
  unless it 's the vampire nazis from outer space . 
   europeans do n't fully integrate their minority populations because other countries have had a great success at integrating minorities , right ? 
   those students have to be identified and encouraged in elementary before they start aligning themselves with gangs . 
  terrorism and criminality have little in common . 
   russians russia has an economy the size of italy ( but 2.3 times the population ) . 
   germany is n't killing southern europe . 
  fine . 
  let 's kill the euro then . 
   france runs an absurd system where the state is responsible for like 70 % of the gdp . 
  the sole reason why we 're not germany 's bitch right now ( like italy and spain are ) is because we have massive companies that do n't get easily pushed around . 
  yeah . 
  so did the guys fighting for isis that happen to be french , belgian , eu nationals . 
  we just need to give them money and they 'll stop going to syria . 
  if you ever go at micky d , do n't order the cat fish . 
  fun fact : aryan is an indo-iranian term . 
  he probably took that ideology to heart ? 
  nope . 
  at about a year difference . 
  hardly significant . 
   well then , we 'll see how it goes . 
  yeah that 's the spirit . 
  major decision that will impact your life for decades upon decades to come ? 
  why analyse the consequences before hand when you can dive in and just take it in as you go . 
  darn brexiters are exactly like independentists i see . 
  no foreplanning . 
  just based on good will and free spirit . 
   we 'll see how much spain values having access to the rest of the continent . 
  please tell me you know aragon is not part of catalonia . 
  spain has plenty of access through aragon.through san sebastian . 
  if we can build a tunnel under the sea , they can make a highway on mountains . 
  in sum : feels  reals . 
  good job dude on convicing people on why catalonian independence is an awesome thing . 
   with international negotiation ( eu ) , aww . 
  you sound like bojo :d always the optimist . 
  we shall get our way because we 're catalonia . 
   4a ) an agreement is reached in which we are still part of the eu so we keep it that way , the most probable option if spain refuses , you will never be in the eu . 
  so you better rethink your `` if they do n't give us independence , we 'll take it '' stance  in negociations it 's a sound strategy not to piss off the opponent . 
   4b ) we are no longer part of the eu , we follow norway 's stance . 
  you still have to apply for that and ** every single eea ** country has to agree ( spain is in the eea ) . 
  you see where this is going ? 
  be prepared to leave catalonia only by plane or boat from now on , if you wan na `` take your rights '', 
  ugh i see i have to spell everything out for you because you refuse common sense : 1 ) spain will ignore your vote . 
  2a ) if by some miracle lets say you create a new state , push with your army , the spanish army outside of catalonia etc etc , then yeah you 'll become a separatist region . 
  then all borders will be closed . 
  2b ) if spain says no to a de facto civil war , you will gain your independence and become a state . 
  but cogratz you are out of the eu and so we 'll close the borders . 
  catalan trucks need to go through france right ? 
  if i recall my geography lessons correctly . 
   plus it 's not like we 'll vote and then be independent the next day yeah what will happen is spain will ignore the vote . 
  like it has done before . 
   nothing of this will happen again you have to reapply . 
  because you 're a new state . 
  you do n't inherit anything from spain . 
  and spain will veto your accession . 
  that 's what will happen if you take the `` we 'll take our independence if spain does n't give it '' route . 
   we 're the only way out for all penninsular trade !, 
  yeah france does n't care much about your peninsular trade . 
  and it 's no idiotic threat . 
  you 'll be ejected from the eu . 
  hello borders my old friend . 
  but then again i see you prefer feelings to logic . 
  ;( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rutnnkhf-eu, 
  dem durty poles tekking muh jerb . 
   if spain does n't want us to have it we 'll take it of course . 
  but dont be surprised when we 'll close your borders and stop any trade , 
   there 's that lovely european community spirit . 
  because : `` dey teek err jeeerbs !, 
  dey teek err binifits !, 
  is a lovely expression of european community , 
   no they are not when their rights are not respected what right is that . 
  and do n't say right for self determination cuz we already proved that if that 's the only right being broken , then you do n't get independence . 
   democracy implies that people are sovereign . 
  yeah they are .
