  spain is a sovereign country . 
  do n't you know the country you live in ? 
   a pacted referendum is impossible in spain sucks being in a democracy based on rule of law ... 
   i did n't know scotland was a colony last year . 
  well you should fucking know that ** the central govt agreed to give them the referendum ** . 
  they did n't decide : oh let 's start a referendum by ourselves and the rest of uk can fuck off . 
  the ** uk people ** through their government decided to let scotland have a referendum on the matter . 
  and i dunno if you realise , but you do n't have the same constitution as uk . 
   catalans are actually a majority in catalonia and a minority in spain . 
  do you need everything to be explained to you slowly and steadily ? 
  ca n't you pick up things from context ? 
   that 's the `` self '' part of `` self-determination '' well go check out the law and how experts analyse it . 
  you can legally define a `` self '' and a `` people '' in that particular context if you can prove that in the larger country that you live in you are discriminated against , oppressed , segregated etc etc. 
  go read anyone that has any understanding of how those articles work . 
  if you 're a linguistic minority you do n't suddenly get to ask for independence just cuz . 
  when does it stop ? 
  can a village ask for independence just cuz they have their own language or dialect ? 
  can the spaniards in catalonia ask for independence from catalonia ? 
  ** again ** just because you 're a minority that does n't mean you get independence . 
   that `` minor independence issue '' recognised by the onu as the right to self-determination da fuq you mention again and again an article used for decolonisation ? 
  are you a colony ? 
  in what way can you prove that you are being disenfranchised , discriminated , oppressed by others in spain ? 
  come on give us examples . 
  you cite shit that has no connection with in reality . 
   coersion does n't work . 
  it 's called democracy and rule of law . 
  you are not being coerced . 
  you are simply a minority . 
  you can not ask for independence simply because you are a minority . 
  honestly some people lack logic . 
   you 're proposing that events with 200 , 50 and 3 dead are on the same scale with the terrorism we 're seeing nowadays . 
  so claiming that we 're seeing the death of peaceful europe is kinda ridiculous, 
   that it 's impossible to change the constitution well that sounds like bullshit since your 78 constitution has already been changed before https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_constitution_of_1978 go to the reform tab to see when . 
   hostile goverment toward us welcome to a democracy based on the rule of law . 
  that means the majority is hostile to your independence grievances . 
  but your rights are about the same as any spaniard so in no way are you discriminated against for being catalan except that minor independence issue  we 'll take this to an international body what international body ? 
  for such an important issue , it amazes me how little you actually know . 
  you sound like a brexiter . 
  use arguments that have no logic in your context , you do n't know the legal process and you ignore the consequences . 
  good luck to you on that  ), 
   wound down by 2000 and for the past 15 years there simply was no mid-to-large-scale conflict in europe , up until euromaidan . 
  the paris riots ? 
  atocha that was the most deadly attack on european soil . 
  london terrorist attacks . 
  it 's just that when you 're a kid , you do n't process it all . 
  you 're in a bubble that bursts later on . 
   you need statistics to know if more people have died in france from terrorist attacks in the last few years ? 
  so before 2012 muslims were perfectly integrated ( much better than uk ( 2005 attack ) and in 2015 it switched ? 
  is that what you 're saying ? 
  that makes sense to you right ? 
  patriotism has nothing to do with comparative feelings . 
  i can be very patriotic but much more muslim . 
   also the whole reason multiculturalism was blamed here was because of terrorist attacks and on that basis france is doing far worse than britain and canada combined . 
  give me statistics or stfu . 
   based on that france 's system is demonstrably worse than britain/canada 's . 
  dude stop spreading bullshit . 
  really . 
  stop . 
  you can not compare muslim immigration in france with the one in uk or canada . 
  uk has muslims from india and pakistan mostly . 
  france from nothern africa . 
  we also have about 80 % more muslims . 
  and canada is just extremely selective about on its migration . 
  7.5 % of french are muslim while 3.9 % canadians are muslim ; and uk 4.5 . 
  if your proof of poor assimilation is well gee look at 'em terrorists attacks , that 's a poor statistic since it is n't representative of basically anything . 
   ( and done far worse compared to the multicultural system in britain and canada ) bullshit . 
  [ here 's a pew poll ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/obdeck/50-7.gif ), 
   `` self-determination of nations '' . 
  god man . 
  that does n't work whenever you want . 
  every country in europe has minorities . 
  you can not split everyone just because ` self determination of people '' . 
  you live in a democratic state that is based around the rule of the law . 
  and the ** most important ** rule is the constitution . 
  you can not break it , you can only change it . 
  or you can try and prove that you are an oppressed minority in spain . 
  good luck with that . 
  if you gain unilateral independence you can be certain that france will close its borders with this new non eu country . 
  congratz on winning isolation . 
  you have to respect the law . 
  what agenda is that ? 
  tell me , 
  a list of facts is agenda pushing ? 
  now now ... 
   the europe of my childhood is gone . 
  what was theeurope of your childhood ? 
  the one with the terrorist attacks in london and atocha , the one with nato bombing of serbia , the one with tens of basque terrorist attacks in spain , the one with gia attacks on the rer b and rue des rosiers and the main terrorist khalen kerkal shot in the streets close to lyon , the one with corsican terrorist bombings , the one with srebenica , the one with the balkan war , the one with the northern ireland bombings and those problems , the one with the fear of ussr nuclear bombing , the one with the constant plne hijackings , the one with the raf terrorist attacks , the one with the italian years of lead and red brigades , the one with the italian mafia , munich 72 attacks , oas terrorist attacks and attempt to kill de gaulle i can continue but it would be nice if you told me what childhood so we know when your bloodless childhood was . 
  or each has its own interest . 
  you did n't offer them enough to convince them to give up rights for their citizens . 
  so the british flag on the communist building did n't convice you to stay ? 
  neither did orban 's page ? 
  dayum you people be picky, 
  great . 
  how can i live in a city where i know someone has balls that are 10 ^ 10 times larger than mine . 
  what visegrad asked was not a surprise by any means . 
  less immigration from outside the eu , seconded employees have to be protected , eu countries have to be forced to respect foreign worker rights , more liberal policies and national govts having control over what gets implemented . 
  it 's no surprise at all . 
   no wonder ~ ~ we left . ~ ~ why uk did n't get what it asked for . 
   we could certainly afford to develop and build them if we really wanted to the nuclear dissuasion program costs about 4 billions but that 's considering that we already have all the things in place and initial cost already spent . 
  apparently the trident costs 12 billion .
