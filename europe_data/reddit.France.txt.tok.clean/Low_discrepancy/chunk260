  we 're not talking about the majority but of the radicalised minority . 
  dictatorships hardly never happen because the majorities agrees with that . 
  it 's just a few very determined individuals . 
  what ? 
  seems more like you 're talking about stuff you do n't know . 
  but oh well . 
  yeah but with communism you can stop and realise : yeah it was a bad idea . 
  with theology ... good luck trying to prove there 's no god and he doesnt ask you to convert everyone to your religion . 
   they can be taken to court to it and then nothing will change . 
  well that 's like saying the police has no power because if they fine you can take them to court . 
   they do n't have any direct power ( also to ping / u/canadianman22 ) what are you talking about ? 
  they can impose fines of up [ to 2-4 % of the global revenues of a company ] ( http://www.franceinfo.fr/emission/france-info-numerique/2015-2016/les-pouvoirs-de-la-cnil-renforces-par-les-deputes-22-01-2016-20-54 ) . 
  they can raid offices etc. 
  that 's plenty of power right there . 
   france , `` the country of human rights '' it was self circle jerking from the beginning . 
  in 1789 we pass the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen . 
  and 3 years later we massacre 150k frenchmen from vend\u00e9e . 
  `` the country of human rights '' is to the leftists in france what `` america is the greatest country in history '' is to the republicans . 
  oh we can not raise taxes cuz we 're the greatest country in the world . 
  oh we can not restrict immigration and solve calais , because we 're the country of human rights . 
  calm down jimmy . 
  the state of emergency would have been lifted had a certain tunisian not decide to go play bumper cart with his 19 ton vehicle . 
  also unlike turkey we do n't remove 50k people from society over the night . 
  what 's first study and second study ? 
   extend malta and estonia 's terms by three months to cover the gap so that 's how the reckoning begins . 
   so if someone threatens you with a knife and you shoot him with a gun , that 's pretty much out of proportion . 
  sauce for that because it would be extreeeemely weird . 
  in france proportionality means that if someone pushed you , you can not start stabbing them . 
  if mike tyson starts punching a 50 kg woman , and she has a gun and replies by smoking him ... well tough cookies mike . 
  it 's legitimate defence . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://www.huyette.net/article-quelques-remarques-generales-autour-de-la-legitime-defense-120036174.html ) you basically have to compare the situations . 
  so / u/maslo59 can be excused because what you 're saying makes it seem that you 're talking waaay more outta your ass so you should provide something to back it up . 
  jews did it . 
  nuff said . 
  dude ... just do what everyone else is doing and slowly walk away from the crazies like / u/anephemeralthrowaway, 
  well then the people who did n't investigate the gulenists should also be removed because of corruption and colluding . 
  but you do n't do it from a list . 
  which is how people are doing in nowadays in that banana sultanate . 
   there were hundreds of such cases then let the justice system do its business . 
   the judiciary did nothing against them , because it helped both g\u00fclen and erdo\u011fan . 
  well then this means that your whole country is corrupt so talking down 50k people is just a massive witch hunt  this would have caused an uproar and serious problems in the bureaucracy previously , but now the turks have the feeling of ` urgency ' and it is easier to pass such things . 
  well let 's hope the eu wo n't remove visas for turkey any time soon . 
  what judicial value does this statement have ? 
   rights are indeed being gradually improved . 
  is it ? 
  is china improving its democracy ? 
  is hong kong more democratic or is china kidnapping people that oppose the regime ? 
  is china more liberal and open to the world or is china more militaristic trying to stir up shit in the south china sea ? 
   when there were exams for law graduates to become judges , g\u00fclenists from the exam commitee shared the questions with loyal students so why was n't that proof of corruption used when they discovered it ? 
  it 's not like they discovered it friday . 
  ah yes . 
  50k people are * all * brainwashed and act like robots . 
  none of them having free agency . 
  and since they can not demolish them ... why not give better rights to people ? 
  i know crazy . 
   advantages of infrastructure , education , rule of law etc. 
  germany does * not * have the same infrastructure and supply chains as china . 
  what if you need a cpu fab close by ? 
  how many fabs does germany have ? 
   with worse infrastructure , lower standards of education well they can leverage that . 
  they do * not * need to add insult to injury and offer worse worker conditions , do they ? 
  yes . 
  you bought in the narrative that a chinese life is worth less than a german . 
  that they deserve fewer protections , that we can pollute their environment more ( that also they deserve fewer freedoms ... communism ) all in the name of having big companies profit . 
  even if they 'd have way more rights , the chinese would be competitive because the standard of living is lower there , they have massive logistic/supply chains , etc. 
  but you bought in the narrative of multinationals . 
  awesome . 
   the chinese worker would no longer be able to compete with the german , would be rendered unemployed , and would end up working in far worse conditions . 
  ah yes . 
  i forgot . 
  you got ta obey . 
  that is totally different from colonialism . 
   an awful lot of african countries never managed to provide stable investment conditions . 
  those african countries suffered from dictatorships , coups , nepotism , corruption etc. 
  there are no two regions that can be compared on this globe . 
   but it 's the best option we have right now yes . 
  the best when we have n't tried anything else . 
  how about forcing companies to improve worker conditions in china or eastern europe ? 
  how about taxing big corporations based on the profits they make in each country and not letting them hide money all over the globe ? 
  what stops a chinese worker from having the same work place benefits as a german ? 
  other than the greed of big companies that are taking advantage of loose worker regulations in poor countries . 
   also never claimed that they have well then it is a witch hunt and the eu should condemn such practices . 
   they were all trained to be better than anyone els wtf ? 
  how did they train someone to pass an interview in engineering ? 
  it 's not like you can train someone to do calculus in 2 days . 
  seems to me a bit like bullshit . 
   conditions that are far better for the workers than those their parents faced . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  we are told to believe that this improvement only came from the kindness of the multinationals . 
  who is to say that conditions would have not improved without forcing people in basically sweat shops ? 
   educators are important if you want to spread an ideology . '', 
  do you have proof that ** every one ** of those 15k spread ideologies instead of teaching what they were supposed to teach ? 
   but number of kids who puts the number of kids on a resume ? 
  i 'd dump it directly if i saw that . 
   age matter much more when it 's a woman the woman tested was 37 yo . 
  i would n't say that 's particularly old . 
  but the most disadvantaged seem to be old people . 
  i 'd hate to be an old moroccan woman from several with 5 kids and a handicap . 
  so if i apply the table from your first comment she would have received : 63 % of 36 % . 
  meaning she would have received about ** 5 ** times fewer positive answers compared to your reference result .
