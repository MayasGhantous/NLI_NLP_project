  you claim they form a secret group . 
  you claim they form a secret kabbalah of people [ ** going for wooorld domination ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protocols_of_the_elders_of_zion ) . 
  you claim that through corruption they obtained the [ higher echelons of society , science , finance etc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_physik ) . 
  you claim they 're responsible for the [ military defeat of your country ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/308r5x/why_did_hitler_blame_the_jews_for_germanys_wwi/ ) . 
  and do n't forget a heavy dose [ of dehumanisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racial_antisemitism ) . 
  like you and / u/mrbirtakim say , you got ta claim they 're all acting like a single body , in unison , that they 're all brainwashed and must be removed because the extreme danger they represent , that they 're all corrupt and no one can think for themselves , that society is much better without them . 
  ** bingo ** , you can now go to town on them . 
  so yeah we get it . 
  that 's why we 're waving flags and telling you wtf guys ? 
   yeah books can be as dangerous as bullets . 
  well luckly you can [ burn them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_book_burnings ) . 
  see how easily a witchhunt can get started ? 
  find a random connection between the people you wan na target , claim that connection is the most important thing in their life , that it defines them and that they all act like zombies for a common goal . 
  start saying they 're a massive danger to society because of the actions of a minority . 
  congratulations you are now a nazi  i hope you enjoy it . 
   politics crippled with religious ideologies . 
  who gives a shit . 
  you treat people equally . 
  a fucking educator , a lawyer or a dean have about 0 impact on a coup . 
  do you think they 'll start throwing the quran and passages of law at the military ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  you are actively cheering for a witchhunt and that is legitimately terrifying . 
  you want to remove who swathes of the population based on what their beliefs are . 
  at what point do you stop and think :  hey maybe we 're the baddies ? 
   and eu and , its bloody visas can go to hell . 
  weird how i feel the same way about turkey . 
   that connects thousands of officials to a terrorist group ? 
  yeah . 
  we have thousands of muslims connected by the quran . 
  lets arrest them all !, 
  ** / s ** fucking backwards country . 
  dude . 
  again . 
  it 's ** fucking educators ** . 
  educators . 
  educators . 
  they bring books and shit . 
  again educators . 
  what kind of fucking power do you think they have . 
  throw the quran at people ? 
  honestly are you people backwards or something ? 
   they 'd consistently try to convince me to study law at uni because ` they needed people there ' . 
  tl ; dr your average eastern european grandmother is part of the gulen society . 
  do you realise that you 're trying to convince us that gulen is bd by saying they tried to convince you to get an education that would see you get paid a large salary ? 
   i 'm not saying these people took part , but i ca n't sympathise with anyone affiliated with gulen whose soldiers crushed people with tanks . 
  did they participate in any way in the crushing of people with tanks ? 
  did they put gasoline in those tanks ? 
  did they drive those tanks ? 
  did they say in their classes oh how great that people got crushed ? 
  so tell me how is that not proof that in turkey there is a blanket ** indiscriminate ** punishment of people ? 
  i hope the eu wo n't even dream to give up visas for turkey . 
   actually it 's islamist vs islamist . 
  it does n't matter . 
  it 's not like they discovered those educators are islamists over night . 
  they knew full well who they are and they should n't be treated in any way differently from other people in the same position . 
   coup perpetrators gulen movement is n't limited to the military dude , we 're talking about , fucking education here . 
  people with books and shit ... books not guns . 
  do you understand the concept of being convicted ** only if found guilty ** ? 
  how about the concept of not convicting people for thought crimes ? 
  darn day by day i realise what a shitty country turkey is . 
  how can people think it 's a good idea to suspend 12k educators or 2k judges ? 
  do you think 14k people participated in a coup and no one said nothing ? 
  goddamn , i hope the good people that find themselves in turkey will leave that country cuz fuck me , it 's backwards . 
  [ and turns out , it 's his own son .

  to be fair a lot of complaints related to democracies is how `` inefficient '' they are . 
  how you just ca n't get up and do stuff on the spot , on a whim . 
  well there 's a reason for that ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_first_use china has a no first use policy . 
  uk does n't . 
   but it nicely shows that our weapons laws work pretty good well just like you said , he was  a stupid , angry teenager so obviously he could n't get a gun . 
  others might be more resourceful , know a few bosnians . 
  i 'm all for hate speech laws but you do n't raid line that unless someone 's life is in danger or whatever . 
  they should have sent the person a citation or send a cop to their door with a warning . 
  not friggin raid their house . 
  apparently uk said they 'll use the bomb if someone uses chemical or biological weapons against them . 
  so not exactly the same . 
  how about a no first use policy ? 
   ` allahu akbar ' ( god is great ) . 
  so that 's what that means !, 
  / u/satyrpan 's point hits harder than a truck doing 70 kmph, 
   i want execution from my heart bleeding heart liberal huh ? 
   i hope this does n't turn into waves of violence . 
  after the purges there will be no more violence . 
   why do you people keep quoting others out of context , is this how low you go ? 
  ** there is ** no fucking context ** . 
  he simply says oh you you divided the country , oh you bluffed , oh you reduced the police , ** oh you brought terrorism in this country ** . 
  well if the right brought terrorism in this country , then valls should assume reponsability for the fact that 3 years into his pm tenure , we have had the worse terrorism attacks the country has ever seen . 
   you can cry all you want about valls having only gotten 6 % of the vote i do n't have to cry , i have to vote . 
  look at approval ratings for hollande and valls ... worse approvals ever . 
  they killed the socialist party in france . 
   you 're like the typical right wing nutjob posting around reddit . 
  do n't get salty . 
  either talk on the topic or give up . 
  if you wan na insult people , go pound sand . 
  no one is idiotic enough to accept your bullshit , retarded insults because you can not carry a conversation and are commenting on shit you know nothing about . 
  i said valls not hollande . 
  * facepalm * in 2011 , hollande was not president and valls was not pm . 
  hollande was a random politician just like valls . 
  they ( and a bunch of other politicians ) ran for the position of being the candidate from the socialist party .
