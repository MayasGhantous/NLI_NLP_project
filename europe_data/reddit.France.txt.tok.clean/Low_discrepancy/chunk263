  they were all equal in the fact that none had any significant position ( other than mayors or in the parlament or whatever ) . 
  since hollande won and beat aubry and others he became the candidate . 
  valls came 5th in that election . 
  better now ? 
  god man ... does it mean that much to you : s ? 
  da fuq are you talking about ? 
   that election is thus irrelevant . 
  do you understand how primaries work ? 
   i will win . 
  what did you win ? 
   i won is that so important to you that you win against me  darn you must really value my opinion . 
  thank you , 
  there 's a time and a place for everything , and a comemoration is n't the place for shit talking politicians . 
  holy shit . 
  then valls should have stopped his career in 2012 when he declared the right brought terrorism in france ... 
   but is n't that kinda accurate ? 
  but is it ? 
  valls extended the state of emergency time and time again . 
  a very important part of the state of emergency is that public gatherings can not be organised . 
  why do you allow a public gathering ( the 14th of july fireworks ) while also allowing a state of emergency ? 
  pick one and stay with it . 
  he fucked up and he should leave . 
  it 's either a dangerous situation and enter state of emergency and ban gatherings . 
  or you think we should live with it and remove the state of emergency . 
  you can not have both . 
  2017 can not come soon enough . 
   the german state managed to shut down those terrorists without taking away all civil rights of the population . 
  ahh that 's cute . 
  you know how germany obtained peace ? 
  [ they fucked over israel by freeing the munich terrorists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lufthansa_flight_615#allegations_of_a_west_german_government_involvement ) . 
   but that does not mean he wo n't see reality , are you joking ? 
  he simply discovered `` reality '' because elections are approaching and suddenly he rediscovered that he is in the * socialist * party . 
  he was a hawk up till now wanting to fight terrorists everywhere . 
  he said that [ voting fn might cause a civil war ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/valls-le-fn-peut-conduire-a-la-guerre-civile-11-12-2015-1989136_20.php ) . 
  [ he blamed the right for the return of terrorism in france ] ( http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20121113.obs9180/valls-accuse-l-ump-le-retour-du-terrorisme-c-est-vous.html ) . 
  he 's a blabbering idiot that can not simply stop barking against any topic actually . 
   i disagree vehemently . 
  unless you can prove that the terrorist attacks were possible only because of his policies a captain goes down with his ship . 
  he does not represent ** anyone ** . 
  during the socialist primaries in 2011 , [ he got 5 % of the votes . ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/primaire_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_socialiste_de_2011 ) . 
  ** in his own friggin party ** ... he came out ** 5th ** . 
  the guy 's a no one . 
  he does n't represent the left , he does n't represent the right . 
  and he does n't represent the people . 
  no one voted for him , he should leave . 
  that is the nature of his seat . 
  it is simply a matter of principle . 
   well then , add those reasons go to / r/france to find out . 
  trust me there are tons . 
  but as a simple matter of principle . 
  you could be friggin jesus on a pony . 
  if during your tenure 200 + frenchmen died , you bow down . 
  you assume reponsability , regardless if you were directly responsible or not . 
   not really . 
  do n't lie  i left an impression . 
  that 's a good boy :d, 
   but he was the first person to actually tell them the truth . 
  what truth ? 
  before now he kept barking against terrorism . 
  he literally said : `` explaining terrorism is excusing it a little '' . 
  now he discovers the truth ? 
   they sold it back in 1860 nobody didnt sell anything to anyone . 
  italy got its ass handed to it by austro-hungary during the first independence war . 
  france stepped in , won a war for italy , italy gained lombardy ( aka the richest part of italy nowadays ) from that and also unification . 
  as a thank you gesture , italy handed nice and savoie to france ( much to the chagrin of gambetta ) . 
  of course there was a `` referendum '' but it was so organised so as to give the desired result . 
   i can predict that there will be some vendetta going sooner or later . 
  well sarkozy said one correct thing :  casse toi , pauv ' con !, 
   and not blame a single prime minister for a terrorist attack . 
  he should resign simply because during his tenure 200 + people died in france due to terrorist attacks . 
  while i could add tens of reasons why he should resign because he is responsible for the irritable state the french society is now ... 
  i think the first reason is plenty . 
  have some balls . 
  that they did n't receive a beating . 
  i 'm happy that i left a memorable impression  why do n't you rewind the convo , see what i told you : * if romania agrees with fewer rights ... sure ... 
  if not , do n't act like a patronising douche telling them what 's better for them . 
  what does one have to do with the other ? 
  romania and bulgaria are ** in ** the eu , turkey is ** not ** . 
  once you 're in the eu , your country has the same rights as any other country . 
  when you 're not in the eu , your country does not have the same rights as other countries . 
  are you confused about what being in the eu means ? 
  because like i told you last time , if you wan na restrict rights for romanians , you have to convince the romanians . 
  good luck with that  are there any other basic concepts that you need help with ? 
  and people are already regretting letting romania and bulgaria in . 
  imagine letting in a country of 75 million ... basically turkey would have become the largest eu in a few years . 
  and also its poorest . 
  yeah poor guy . 
  he had to make that pact that split eastern europe in half . 
  gosh poor soul . 
   france said this first . 
  say what ? 
  http://www.europe1.fr/politique/sarkozy-la-turquie-ne-doit-pas-etre-membre-de-lunion-europeenne-2629425 sarkozy was always against it . 
  do you realise that the median wage in turkey is about the same as romania 's ? 
  and romania is a country of 20 million , not 75 million and growing . 
  turkey isnnt in the eu because turkey 's economy is shit . 
  more like participating in starting a war that killed some 20 million of his follow countrymen . 
   i think google did great work to advance this sort of culture ah yes , the old google style interviews . 
  definitely a successful story / s. 
  glad i heard they dropped it . 
  banks are finally starting to too,
