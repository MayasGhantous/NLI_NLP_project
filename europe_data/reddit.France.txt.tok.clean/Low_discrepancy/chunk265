  are you for real ? 
  and no , there is no obligation for a friggin higher education . 
   a doctor for the public health system made less than the average wage in 2015 . 
  that 's right , they made less than 400 euros . 
  how long have you been in romania ? 
  do you even realise the level of bribes they take ? 
  doctors in the country side never go grocery shopping . 
  look at the former mayor of bucharest , sorin oprescu . 
  voted in because people thought he was trustworthy ... but oh well ... old habits die hard, 
  this is management not engineers or traders . 
  they wan na sell things with characteristics that are impossible to achieve . 
   think we knew about it , because we ( and the japanese ) were doing it too . 
  volkswagen was just the first and got all the press do you have any proof other car manufacturers put in their cars devices ** specifically * made to cheat tests ? 
  because that 's the main issue . 
  so paying back a lown = north korea ? 
  go ask the us how they do it : you pay over the nose and are in debt for a long time . 
  is that better ? 
  because that 's what will happen, 
   it 's not like they will afford it and they are n't eu citizens so ca n't get it free elsewhere or be given student loans . 
  and i am not the son of bush so never will i know who really did 9/11 . 
  / s life 's unfair but the older generations try to make it more fair by paying taxes so that young kids can get an education and pay back in one way or the other . 
  i 'd much rather have a younger person earn less than having old people die because they did n't get the medical care they needed . 
  we 're talking here about comfort vs basic needs . 
  a doctor is a basic need . 
  and no matter the country : romania , germany , france a doctor will live much better than the average population . 
  but since they get greedy they wan na make as much as german doctor . 
  but again it 's no one 's fault explicitly . 
  the older generations are simply too generous and absence of arbitrage fucks them up . 
  since there is no free meal , the older generations will wise up an tighten the conditions and stop giving out free education . 
   `` ok , i 'll be born in macedonia and then move to the uk after completing higher education ! '', 
  a ** huge ** amount of people say : okay this country is shitty , i 'll get higher education for free and move to another country to make a nice salary . 
  18-19 yos are n't exactly stupid you know that right ? 
  why should older generations pay taxes for the education system so that people can bail out of the country ? 
   you do n't choose to be given that ; come again ? 
  of course you choose whether to go to a university or not . 
  again here i 'm talking about higher education , i.e. 
  useful education that costs a lot and actually produces the brain drain . 
  eastern europe is suffering from a shortage of medical staff for example . 
  a non negligible number of med students get a very cheap education in romania then move to the west to get a nice fat pay check . 
   that they are getting educated and fleeing the corrupted state . 
  well that 's the problem . 
  if the state ( read taxpayers , read your fellow citizens ) paid for you to become a doctor so that you can help other people , then you do have some form/some period of legally binding period where you have to stay in your country . 
  the state essentially gave you a credit and you should pay back that credit . 
  well it 's more complicated though . 
  if say the country you were born in paid for your education and as soon as you graduate you take your skills and use them in another country ... then yes you have participated in making your fellow citizens poorer . 
  they gave you money indirectly by paying for your education and you bail out . 
  if you get your higher education elsewhere , then yeah who gives a shit where you were born ? 
  be free man . 
  what real conclusions do you need ? 
  we all know russia gave the logistic support to shoot down that plane . 
  how about we not put all muslims in the same bag huh ? 
  the large majority are very normal people . 
  there is a somewhat sizeable majority that has problems with integration and has some messed up views but nothing that can not be fixed with some education . 
  and a smaller minorty that causes criminality problems and in that smaller minority those that are crazy fucked up people . 
  how about we jail people who have gone to fight in syria ? 
  oh you have extremist views and went to a war zone ... oh sorry friend ... prison for you . 
  also we ban from the french territory any and all foreign citizens that have been sentenced to jail for violent acts ? 
   i majored in it in fact , oh my . 
  / r/iamverysmart  this sub loves to wallow in pseudo-nazi belief in the superiority of white man , it 's hilarious how stiff your peckers get when you wank to your precious european civilisation . 
  okay besides the long ass diatribe that only serves as your own masturbatory aid : look-a-me , i 'm on my white stallion telling people how awesome i am ... did you in any way prove that france had any hard connection with the algerian civil war . 
  you literally spent 253 word ( 1500 characters ) and you said nothing of worth for a '' ba in history '' . 
  just one comment saying france was better equipped during the algerian war ... what 's that got to do with the algerian civil war ? 
  the rest being you saying twice you got a ba in history , that russia admits fault for chechnya ( how long will russia support the dictator kadyrov though [ who kills journalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramzan_kadyrov#accusations_of_human_rights_abuses ) ... we dont know ) , something about belgians and the congo , the uk and its colonies and how / r/europe is neo-nazi . 
  ** none of those commentes have anything to do with the algerian civil war . 
  ** fuck ... ** not one ** sentence of your run-on comment has anything to do with the algerian civil war . 
  but i 'll help you because unlike you i do n't saying hey guys look i have a degree , that gives me authority but i wont talk about the issue . 
  the civil war started in 1991 , a whopping 30 years after the algerian war ended . 
  you wan na see the makeup of the population ? 
  https://populationpyramid.net/algeria/1991/ here you go slowpoke . 
  more than half of the population were born after the war ended . 
  if you add up the people that were too young to remember the war ( so about 5-8 yo ) that makes up 2/3rds of the population . 
  between 1962 and 1991 , the population of algeria ** doubled ** . 
  the fln could not keep up with the growth rates , poverty increased , opportunities decreased . 
  salafism and islamism therefore became rampant amongst the younger generation so they won elections ( even though they ran on an platform that was undemocratic ) but the fln was n't ready to lose power . 
  boom civil war . 
  so how about trying to sound less like a coked addled stroke victim and talking more on points ? 
  how about you go insult less and read more ? 
   sub loves to wallow in pseudo-nazi belief in the superiority of white man no wonder you love being here then . 
  russia has the largest population of neo-nazis so you must feel like home here , then . 
  now go vote putin and leave everybody alone . 
  also stop killing ukrainians and blowing up civil planes . 
  nothing . 
  but if i say there needs to be a drastic reduction in mexican immigrants all while wearing a trump tshirt , i doubt you 'll think i 'm an unbiased journalist . 
   may it perhaps have something to do with your colonialism and the bloody war you gave them instead of granting independence come again ? 
  it was bloody on both sides . 
  look at how people fln `` made disappear '' . 
  the harkhis were hunted down after the war . 
  if you think one side is evil and the other innocent you are gravely mistaken and you know jack about history . 
  and concerning the civil war : it was fln ( i.e. 
  the guys that france fought in the war ) vs islamists . 
  what the heck do you think france would be involved with any ? 
  sure we indirectly supported fln because who wants islamists at their door step , but then again we support al sisi . 
  i get that you 're trying to be edgy and say it 's the white man 's fault . 
  but that 's not the case here buddy . 
  go read up what really happened . 
  part of a democracy is the rule of law ... it 's not just `` the majority of the population gets a vote '', 
  oh man , this live chick on sky https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60wdzzt8yg with a head veil saying that trukey has a very healthy democracy . 
  and that erdogan said everything is okay so that means it 'll be ok . 
  okay ended now . 
  whew fascinating .
