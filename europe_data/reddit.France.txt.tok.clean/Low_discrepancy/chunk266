  it 's kinda gutt wrenching seeing the same news over and over again . 
  about this . 
  i 'm poison these days . 
  where are you from btw  ? 
  you guys are awesome . 
  in order to commemorate the nice attacks , you performed the most french action there is : removing your head of state . 
  that 's an honour , thank you . 
  hello friend . 
  thank you for removing nice and france from the news . 
  you did us a solid . 
  turkish army did the bastille invasion . 
  the bastards are playing the long game . 
  you can always count on the turks to remove heat from the french and the french to remove heat from the turks . 
  we 're good friends . 
  so you mean to say they knew of the attack before ? 
  fuck this bullshit indeed . 
  what i 'll take away is this fucking [ cowboy ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/07/15/nice-heros-attentat_n_11009184.html ) on a scooter gunning after the truck and clinging on its side . 
  isis is mostly a sunni arab phenomenon so it 's no surprise there . 
   a sick compromise but hey , they 're not blowing anyone up . 
  the turks also come from a stable country while our algerians come from a country that has been crippled by a decade long civil war than ended only in 2002 . 
  why ? 
  because we have balls of steel . 
  here 's [ a guy on scooter ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/07/15/nice-heros-attentat_n_11009184.html ) that chased after the truck and tried to cling on its side . 
  fuck , how can i continue living knowing there is someone in this fucking city that has balls bigger than my head . 
  so you want a reduction in muslim immigration ... is that what i 'm hearing ? 
   if not they 'd be stateless , which poses a lot of problems , both for them and your government . 
  no it doesnt . 
  france never ratified the convention on apatrides . 
  it suffices for the parlement to over turn a law . 
  sauce [ 1 ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/01/04/decheance-de-nationalite-aucun-texte-international-empeche-france-rendre-personne-apatride_n_8911140.html ) and [ 2 ] ( http://www.slate.fr/story/112291/droit-creer-des-apatrides ) . 
  the first contains the a former minister of justice and also a group of lawyers that specialise in the rights of refugees and asylum seekers . 
  the second is an assistant prof that specialises in constitutional law at the university of lille . 
  let 's not go there just yet . 
  i mean isis * is * bad , but ... vegan ? 
  you sure man ? 
  they were ghettos where people were left on their own . 
  it worked ok for the first generation . 
  like / u/ziggypox said , it 's cheap but it 's nice and waay better than shitting in a bucket in a north african slum . 
  but well they were left on their own and you know how ghettos get . 
  of course we do n't agree . 
  i am for removing the citizenship of those that have left for syria and sending them to jail for a long time . 
  no need to track them anymore ... because it 's fucking impossible . 
  there are ** too many ** people who fought in iraq and syria . 
  these are very dangerous , battle hardened people . 
   and yesterday 's terrorist was n't among them . 
  i do n't yet who the guy was . 
  he still came from a region that has a huge number of loonies . 
  the paris attacks and coulibaly have went to syria and yemen . 
   `` hey , this guy suddenly became very religiously muslim , let 's wiretap him '' . 
  you are being ridiculous here . 
  some [ 1500 ] ( http://lci.tf1.fr/france/societe/le-nombre-des-departs-de-francais-pour-l-irak-et-la-syrie-en-forte-8591729.html ) french left for iraq/syria . 
  these are n't people that suddenly became more religious . 
  these are the real deal . 
  you need ** 21000 ** fucking people to track them 24/7 . 
  that 's 0.5 googles . 
  it 's friggin huge man . 
  that 's ** 6 dgsi ** ( dgsi being the interior secret services that tracks the baddies ) . 
  dude i do n't think you realise how big these numbers are . 
  how enormous they are . 
  these terrorist strikes wo n't stop tomorrow ... 
   what matters is the share of the muslim population in france though so you 're saying where there 's more muslims it 's more dangerous ? 
  do you really wan na go that route ? 
   merely in a few months or years , which makes it even harder to spot . 
  go ask their families if they noticed odd behaviour . 
  most will say yes . 
   i do n't think that they have a wide support amongst the muslim population , maybe they do but it does n't matter anyway . 
  wan na go ask booba , one the biggest french rappers what he thinks about the charlie hebdo attacks ? 
  how about the 200 + cases of french students that refused to respect a minute of silence after charlie hebdo ? 
  of course the majority disagree . 
  but the problem here is ** how big is the minority ** that supports those acts . 
  if it 1/1000 or 1/1 million ? 
  1 in 1 million we can handle , 1 in 1 thousand ... oh shit . 
   ask the turks and the iraqis . 
  i 'm in france . 
  i have to wait daily on the promenade , i have to wait for the bus there to go to work , on weekends i bike , jog and walk there to go to the beach . 
   they could monitor and infiltrate actual terrorist cells , hate-preaching mosques and the like . 
  & nbsp ;  dear mr. abdeslam , my name is michel dupont , i 'm from haute savoie and i will want to integrate your terrorist cell of 5 people . 
  thank you very much . 
  alpes maritimes has about 515 people flagged for extremism . 
  you need about 14 people to tack 1 person 24/7 / that means you need 7210 people in total to track those crazies . 
  there are [ 8250 ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2016/02/02/01016-20160202artfig00368-islamisme-8250-individus-radicalises-en-france.php ) radicalised people in france . 
  you would need 115500 agents to track them . 
  you need as many as ** 2 googles ** to track them . 
  ( google has 57k employees ) . 
  are you being serious ? 
   i do n't see how average muslims living in secular societies could fix the problem here either . 
  well there are means and ways . 
  how about not accepting extremist behaviour ? 
  nice and the region is the area in france that sends the highest number of jihadists , besides parisian region . 
  6.8 % of jihadists but 1.8 % of the total population of france . 
  that 's ** 4 ** times the rate . 
  clearly we have significant issues in france nowadays . 
  it 's not like these people woke up one morning and out the blue they decided ... okay i 'll just go murder people in syria . 
  it 's a long process of indoctrination . 
  and since so many have come from just a tiny region of france , local factors are significant . 
  we closed a number of muslim places of prayer in this area after the attacks . 
  why ? 
  what happened with those people that ran them ? 
  why did they become extremist ? 
  who spoke out and who knew about it and just shrugged thinking okay that 's a bit more an extreme version of islam but it 's okay cuz he 's stll muslim and islam is peace ?
