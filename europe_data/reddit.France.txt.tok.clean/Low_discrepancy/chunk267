  edit ( and pinging / u/thomanou ) [ le monde says ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/live/2016/07/15/en-direct-plusieurs-morts-a-nice-apres-qu-un-camion-a-fonce-sur-la-foule_4969598_1653578.html?highlight=298413823 ) that journalists that were at the street where the crazy driver lived were attacked with thrown bottles from the windows and spray paint on their cameras . 
  so faux tolerance ? 
  they are the single worst thing that has happened to france in the last 70 years . 
   what percentage of the people involved in the attacks have been algerians ? 
  notable mentions : * [ khaled kerkal ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/khaled_kelkal ) franco-algerians : * 1 ) [ mohammed merah ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohammed_merah ) * 2 ) [ mehdi nemmouche ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehdi_nemmouche ) * 3 ) [ said and cheif kouachi ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c3%a9rif_et_sa%c3%afd_kouachi ) * 4 ) [ samy amimour ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/samy_amimour ) * 5 ) [ ismael omar mostefai ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/isma%c3%abl_omar_mostefa%c3%af ) * 6 ) [ foued mohamed-aggad ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/foued_mohamed-aggad ), 
   what concrete , workable solutions do you propose ? 
  * 1 ) long prison sentences for those that have been to syria and participated in the jihad . 
  * 2 ) actual border controls so we know when our friendly jihadists have returned measures 1 and 2 would have prevented the bataclan attack . 
  measure 2 , when applied allowed france to know that abdeslam salah had left the country and thus also prevented the bruxelles attack from happening in france . 
  * 3 ) deportation of any and all foreign citizens convicted of acts of violence . 
  nice ** allegedly ** was caused by a tunisian that was involved in acts of violence in france . 
  ** to be verified though ** * 4 ) the complete distruction of all soviet style housing in every area of france . 
  the construction of new , more smaller housing spread around france . 
  * 5 ) educating all people on the attrocities committed by the french ** and ** also by the algerians during the civil war . 
  * 6 ) science/history classes where they educate people on a regular basis the bullshit written in religious books . 
  i can keep continuing ... 
  ** we do not know if it 's islamic ** . 
  so do not say it 's islamic since we do n't know anything . 
  concerning islamic terrorism , alpes maritimes ( the area where nice is ) sends about 1 in 10 french jihadists in syria . 
  but the population of alpes maritimes makes 1.7 % of the population on continental france . 
  also this : http://www.nicematin.com/faits-de-societe/djihadisme-les-alpes-maritimes-comptent-515-radicalises-23613, 
  they found guns in the truck https://twitter.com/nice_matin/status/753728006535905280, 
  we do n't know who did it and why , just yet . 
  i could give you some statistics though that might show why if a certain hypothesis is confirmed then it is not a surprising attack . 
  do you think they put concrete barriers ? 
  have you ever been to any public event ? 
  no as you can see here https://twitter.com/nice_matin/status/753700953707126784 the police shot the driver . 
   how did the truck get past the security ? 
  are n't the roads around blocked when there 's events on the national day ? 
  the fireworks were at the sea . 
  there 's a long street parallel to the sea called promenade des anglais ( that goes east west ) . 
  there are streets perpendicular to that ( that go north south ) . 
  going from west to east the promenade was blocked from bvd gambetta to the east ( which is the main part of nice ) . 
  the truck arrived from the west ( maybe started mowing people at bvd magnan ) and stopped very near gambetta where the road blocks started . 
  but again a huge truck as you can see [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/nice_matin?lang=fr ) chauffer was shot and killed by the police . 
  the prefecture ( sebastien humbert ) just said on bfm tv that the driver was shot and killed by the police .

  again . 
  read up adam smith . 
  the ability to search for work in rich regions ** is essential ** to the concept of single market . 
  he 's from your island , read him up . 
  what is 100 % sure is that uk did n't work for a more unified market . 
  so wanting to benefit from it is a hypocritical . 
  we both learnt something then , 
   / u/red _ coats downvotes why are you telling me ? 
  it 's borderline ad-hominem . 
  do n't read if you do n't like it . 
   talk about how free movement is a great benefit then turn round and say people need to deal with costs of single market , namely free movement . 
  it 's neither a cost nor a benefit . 
  it 's a cost and a benefit . 
  its both and neither . 
  it 's just one of the 4 pillars of the single market . 
  you can not have a single market without free movement . 
  go ask adam smith . 
  imagine if tomorrow london says : okay londoners can sell services and goods to the rest of uk but non londonian uk citizens can not come and work in london . 
  will you call uk a single market then ? 
   i think we should really try and stop downvoting people we do n't agree with , especially here on / r/europe after brexit . 
  da fuq you talking about ? 
   huge slashes to corporation tax . 
  i love how you think you can be aggressive towards the eu and still get great deals . 
  darn you 're an optimistic bunch . 
  m&a , lbo are ** huge ** activities in europe that bring a lot of money , much more than your 20 % . 
  the same goes for advising etc. . . 
  these will have to be done in europe . 
  do you think banks will refuse that business ? 
  if they do refuse it , other companies will come take their place . 
  again meaning more jobs on the continent . 
  thanks brexit , 
   this is essentially what churchill was saying when he commented on the uk needing to choose the ocean large rather than europe . 
  well go tell jamie dimon that he knows jack shit when he said that thousands of jobs will be moved on the continent if uk loses his pasport . 
  you know better than the ceo of the largest us bank , right ? 
  people are just tired of seeing the brits wanting cake and eating it too . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  look at this guy : he wants to not be part of the single market but to benefit from ** all the rights given by the single market ** . 
  it 's like people forgot logic and reason . 
   so that not having passported access becomes less important in terms of profits . 
  sigh . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how any of it works . 
  what 's the profit tax ? 
  do you think that the loss of eu activity will make up for that 20 % profit ? 
  they 'll just move jobs on the continent and call it a day . 
  see jamie dimon ceo of jpm . 
   are they entirely focused on exports to the eu ( and nowhere else ) then ? 
  ask jamie dimon that said thousand of jobs might be moved out of london if uk loses its financial passport . 
  you know what the single market gets you ? 
  financial passport . 
  talking to you is like talking to someone from a sect . 
  you keep repeating the same bs , the same phrases , the same `` logic '' despite the constant reasons given to you . 
  you give articles that cite bs ranks or bs reasons :  french president fran\u00e7ois hollande has been notably combative , telling les echos that britain will lose its vital right to commercial passporting `` completely '' the moment it steps out of the club . 
  this clashes head on with france 's parallel policy of intimate defence ties with britain . 
  wtf has financial passport to do with european defence . 
  either way stripping the uk of passporting will only cause more issues for the eu yes . 
  more jobs in paris and frankfurt and a rise in property prices . 
  sigh , we 'll survive . 
   withdrawing passporting will be seen as protectionism and will cause issues with the eu economies . 
  yes , it 's protectionism . 
  eu citizens need to be protected and need to benefit from the single market . 
  if uk leaves , well that 's that . 
   for example the firms in questions can just be registered in any european country but still do business through london .
