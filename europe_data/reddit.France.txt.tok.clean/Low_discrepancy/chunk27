  43/2 * 2 has a precise meaning = 43 . 
  it 's not ambiguous anymore than an axiom or a definition is ambiguous ( they are n't ) . 
   mathematical notation is not actually based on indo european grammar . 
  it 's not a mathematical notation . 
  people simply decided that 1/2 \\* 2 = 1 because that 's * what makes sense * . 
  okay . 
   still rocking calculus calculations not calculus :p, 
   it 's a troll question that is intentionally ambiguous . 
  no it 's not . 
   post this youtube video this vid is a bit non-sensical ( the same goes for his infinite sums vids , but he 's got a master i ' physics not maths so it 's understandable ) . 
  why ? 
  ever read a cook book :  1/2 table spoon of sugar and go in a rant : put the parenthesis !, 
  how should i know if it 's * 1 / ( 2 * table spoon ) or * ( table spoon ) / 2 no ? 
  why ? 
  oh because the cook book obviously means table spoon / 2 because the inverse of a table spoon is not a thing . 
  the same goes here : 48/2 ( 9 +3 ) = 24 twelves = 288 . 
  ( / u/gerrit8500 ) the question is valid and has a simple answer . 
  it 's people who do n't understand how indo-european grammar works that get confused . 
  all the idiots would have a meltdown thinking it 's 2 . 
  if `` coming home '' = unleashing , i guess ... 
  maybe there 's kurds in those waters ? 
  bs article is bs . 
  they do n't even have high speed rail on that route . 
  by normal train it takes apparently about 3 hours , if they build a high speed line it should take 1h15 min . 
  but yeah they 'll just build a hyperloop . 
  idf do n't have a sense of humor . 
  i am not attacking belgians . 
  but i am very critical if the belgian govt and services . 
  the very exact same goes for the french services and govt . 
  they fucked up big big time and the results will be seen ( the left will most likely not get to power for at least a decade because economical reason but also because the reaction to the attacks split it in two ) . 
   `` they did n't do squat '' is completely wrong . 
  granted . 
  it 's a bit harsh . 
  but like you said abdeslam was arrested but the terror alerts were n't raised even though a few dangerous individuals were still on the run . 
  the most important was ibrahim bakraoui . 
  he rented the apartment abdeslam lived in forest . 
  they also discovered traces of explosives . 
  also in 2009 he shot at the police with an ak and in 2015 a few months after being released was found by the turkish at the border ready to go to syria . 
  and last tuesday he entered an airport with a bag full of explosives and an ak . 
  wtf ? 
  you agree with me there 's a problem somewhere . 
  but i was simply explaining the guy why an add campaign should n't talk about hard stuff in their ads etc. 
  and it was not presenting the full image of belgium , namely the high state of alert for a terrorist strike . 
   i 'm pretty sure you guys `` fear terrorist attacks '' just as much as we do yup . 
  that 's why i did n't buy a ticket for france 's first game . 
  and that 's why i do n't tell people yeah you wo n't have any problems if you visit . 
  sure the probability of getting killed or injured is super super low . 
  but the probability of the country going in lock down mode and it ruining your travel plans and vacation is high . 
  well i also added the emb site with their statement . 
  i added a link to http://www.embnet.be/default.aspx?base saying that the council never said such a think . 
  so there 's that . 
  do non-muslim belgians hold a minute silince attacks targeting muslims ? 
  we do n't really make any distinction you know . 
  in the paris attacks or others muslims died too . 
  we did n't make a list and said : yeah we wo n't a minute of silence for some people . 
   i seriously doubt the mosques will go empty all of the sudden . 
  normal people would still go . 
  cuz you know ... 
  they 're there to pray and practice their religion . 
  crazy terrirs wo n't because well they 're more into terror than religion . 
  did you read the text in the link ? 
  that was the general recommendation given by the conseil des th\u00e9ologiens . 
   mosques held a minute of silence and prayer . 
  and yes , even the mosque in molenbeek . 
  do you have any sources that all the mosques held a moment of silence and a prayer for the victims , therefore disregarding the advice given by the theologian council ? 
  thanks . 
   what makes france france ' has certainly not been unchanging since the years of the founding of the republic you read an article on wiki and that was it ? 
  mkay . 
  https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/histoire_de_la_la\u00efcit\u00e9_en_france here you go . 
  secularism has a long history in france starting with the revolution . 
  the 1905 law did n't just drop out of the sky . 
  it was through a series of iteration . 
   french soldiers do not wear red pants anymore * facepalm * you 're comparing pants with one of the most important aspects of french ideals . 
  ** the first phrase of article 1 of the constitution ** :  la france est une r\u00e9publique indivisible , la\u00efque , d\u00e9mocratique et sociale . 
  can you tell me what the 3rd word is ? 
  after the republic and the indivisible part before the democratic and social part ? 
  now ctrl+f the constitution for `` pantalon garance '' thx . 
   but , since your french is probably i know more about my history that you , yes . 
   who owns the french churches these days ? 
  any church built after 1905 belongs to the church ( diocese )  where does the french catholic church gets it financing from ? 
  from those that go to church : the french catholics . 
  i know ... weird . 
  who pays for those mcdonalds restaurants : people who buy mcdonald 's food . 
  shocking . .  who decides on their doctrine ? 
  how should i know ? 
  * all these do n't apply in alsace-moselle . 
  http://mobile.lesoir.be/1162629/article/selection-abonnes/2016-03-25/dans-mosquees-pas-prieres-pour-mecreants le soir publishing \u00e0 hoax to fuel hatred ? 
   but how pervasive will this message be ? 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  but the terries were n't really religious . 
  there are stories about abdeslam smoking a joint and watching isis vids . 
   ( note , all in french speaking belgium ) :d yeah france . 
   i do n't like throwing others under the bus , especially when they 're down . 
  did n't 2 ministers offer their resignation letters ? 
  or did i misread stuff ? 
   keep your `` belgium please join france '' messages wtf man . 
  lem me grab my pop-corn . 
  i love how you 're projecting . 
   i 'm albanian ethnically , born and raised in austria and i live in brussels ( work for an eu institution ) . 
  are you interviewing with me ?
