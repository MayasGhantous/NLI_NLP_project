  if you 're in th\u00e9 eu you have to respect the european convention of human rights . 
  like it or not french and german democracies and french and german intelligence agencies ** worked ** . . 
  depending less on the us is a good thing and people who decide to invade other countries should be under prosecution ( looking at you sarkozy ) . 
  fully functional state ? 
  the us would have had to stay for several generations for that to happen . 
  poland and romania allowed the transit of people bound for guantanamo on their soil ( also secret prisons ) . 
   many of those will not feel represented by a leadsom-lead government why not ? 
  who 's leadsom btw ( besides being a mother apparently ) . 
  besides the iowa thing , everything else applies also to europe . 
  unless you do n't buy your food from the supermarket but your local farmers . 
  that 's what europeans do , right ? 
  it was the soldiers call to join the war because they 're `` keeping america free '' or some other propagandistic bs they bought in . 
   the economy is growing again , with growth rates that are among the strongest in europe . 
  there 's new hope for the future . 
  do n't count your chicks before they 've hatched . 
  we still got ta fine spain for its high deficit . 
  we got ta hammer them with austerity because that works . 
  poultry that hangeupside down and getting their heads lobbed off by machines . 
  cows pushed and prodded before they get stunned . 
  pigs having to live all their lives in 1sqm space . 
  animals stuffed with antibiotics because they live in their shit . 
  oh , check iowa and their sow breeding cages . 
  we have massive massive issues with industrial agriculture . 
  it 's a classic debate about offense and defence . 
  what could argue if the soldiers that died in iran or afghanistan were really unavoidable casualties ... that being said the matador died doing something he enjoyed so oh well ... 
   animals processed for food are often slaughtered quickly and relatively painlessly :d good one man . 
   so , expect your salvation from us , not eu . 
  you do know that obama said he 'll never intervene in ukraine . 
  but hey promises are free to dispense right ? 
   how doors are wide open for us in nato . 
  you know that 's never going to happen . 
  the great hawk and military expert ( as seen in aghanistan and irak ) doubya bush told you that he is for ukraine and georgia [ joining nato ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/01/nato.georgia ) . 
  germany of course went `` neah , not gon na happen . '', 
  russia went : `` so that 's how you wan na play ? 
  fine let 's start a war '' . 
  and the fact that georgia 's prez was a looney did n't help . 
  so now you 're in a situation where you simply will never be let to join nato . 
  you can not escape the fact that you 're in russia 's back yard anymore than cuba can escape where it is . 
  and joining the eu ? 
  your gdp per capita is ** 2.5 ** times smaller than romania . 
  never was, 
  after the tdf is nothing happens yes we 'll get out . 
  honestly some people do n't know anything about european politics, 
  come again ? 
  they 'd also be forced to take literal saudi arabian isis immigrants that pretend to be refugees , right ? 
  what would an irregular forehead be ? 
   romania and bulgaria are well developed okay i stopped reading here since obviously you have no idea what developed and developping means . 
  cheers, 
  you think romania and bulgaria are developed countries ? 
  holy shit you brits know jack about the economy . 
  no wonder you guys thought brexit is a good move for the economy . 
  and v4 is barely barely developed . 
  did the pound ever recover ? 
  why not compare poverty levels with germany , france and other developed countries . 
  yeah . 
  we can all make 0 hour jobs and claim unemployment decreased . 
  why do n't you look at poverty level ey ? 
  yeah . 
  yeah it does . 
  look at nationalist parties . 
  everything about them is us vs they . 
  and now you 'll get a new fine . 
  makes sense does n't it ? 
   mainly a french post-colonial issue til al qaeda is a post colonial issue . 
  thanks . 
  concerning the rest of your comment it 's just a hodgepodge of stereotypes concerning the virtuous germans and the lazy others . 
  dude the eurozone has significant issues . 
  stop playing the lazy greeks card . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  look at finland , significant issues . 
  look at eastern europe saying they 'll avoid joining the euro as much as they can . 
  that shows problems are significant . 
   that 's the right way to deal with far-right and far-left populists . 
  so merkel and her we 'll just keep doing things like we 're doing them now is the solution ? 
  and now they wan na fine the portuguese and spanish when their economies are finally picking up . 
  it 's madness and all madness ends at a certain point . 
  germany 's inaction will lead to an erosion of european unity and the destruction of the eurozone . 
  it can not be another way . 
  when you can not devalue your currency to be as competitive as the germans , you suffer . 
  and spain and portugal simply do not have the industrial means to be as competitive as germany in terms of equal currency . 
  in france the cost of living is friggin higher than in germany . 
  that 's grade a stupidity and it 'll end . 
   uk and elsewhere these native-born poles bullshit . 
  polish in france are just french with silly names . 
  koscielny how do you spell that ? 
   can you provide me a link where hollande proposed something like that ? 
  meant eurobonds , [ collaterizng the debt ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/22/eurozone-crisis-eurobonds-hollande-merkel ) . 
   european government think it 's called the comission . 
   a european army not going to happen since eu nations have vastly different interest . 
  mali where the germans simply said it 's a french problem they do n't wan na deal with that . 
  going even further in this direction would be mad . 
  the euro will die without any help . 
  italy has had 2 % growth in the past 15 years . 
  how long do you think that can last ? 
  germany is reaping the benefits of the euro and has little drawback other than throwing a few billions in the direction of greece . 
  france and germany make friggin money from the greek situation . 
  that 's not normal . 
  face it man , the eurozone is doing badly . 
  very badly and in 20 years ( as the old french that are rich and keep le pen out die off ) it 'll disappear . 
   i do n't exactly trust their governments to tie their shoelaces together .
