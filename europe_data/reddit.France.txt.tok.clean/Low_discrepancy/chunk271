  who the heck are you ? 
  some important figure head of german politics and we need to convince you of something ? 
  the amount of self important people on this subreddit is waaay too high . 
  jupp\u00e9 is in favour of such a measure . 
  so was hollande when elected but merkel said no . 
  your ( leave 's ) idea of reforming was to reduce the right of free movement . 
  thanks but no thanks . 
   notably japan and its women only train cars . 
  yeah japan has a horrendous ranking in gender equality . 
  lowest in oecd . 
   that we do n't get any political power in return ? 
  does texas get any political power in alabama ? 
  then you do n't get any political power either . 
  what you get is ** fiscal ** power , you get to decide where the money you send gets spent . 
  and that 's basically enough . 
  the cost of living in france is higher than in germany , thats not normal but we ca n't really devalue the euro can we ? 
  the ball is in germany 's court . 
  because the euro wo n't survive 20 years , not in this state . 
   and the alternative is ? 
  dump the euro ? 
  or fiscal union . 
  there 's a reason why eurozone is suffering except germany and poland and other eu non eurozone countries said : yeah the euro ... we 'll get back to you guys ... 
  well let 's hope southern euro countries + france gang up because shit is getting ridiculous . 
  look at portugal and spain facing sanctions for their deficit , look at finland . 
  we either scap the euro or we create a fiscal union . 
  just like with schengen ( common borders but no common intelligence service or common policing ) , we 're putting the carriage before the horse . 
  did you read the article ? 
   `` and i also expect the commission to continue with this firm line . 
  the next one in line has to be france . 
  also french deficit is at 3.5 % while portugal is at 4.4 and spain at 5.1 . 
  their targets were 2.5 % and 4.2 % . 
  the next reform to be carried out should be a fiscal unification . 
  but merkel is opposed to that so no reform will happen ( she 's basically playing the `` if it 's still limping do n't fix it '' game ) . 
  you do n't need to friggin panick . 
  it 's not like the us , british or french govt are spying on us , reading our private mails . 
  considering how generic industrially made printers are nowadays , no . 
  even in the old days , authoritarian regimes would ask typewriter owners to submit a copy of all symbols so they can keep and check . 
  but nowadays that would be next to impossible considering how widespread and similar personal printers are . 
  using glue is way more dangerous . 
  you can leave bits of dna stuck to it , fingerprints ... 
  also their [ ports ] ( http://internal.uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/idukkbn0nk2e520150429 ), 
   i also kinda disagree with the notion that more money would fix greece . 
  the imf called . 
  impressed by your very detailed and precise analysis , they want * you * as their next president, 
  is it just me , or does theletter with newspaper clipped words look super stupid ? 
  you can print out a letter you goddamn idiot you . 
  you do n't have any testing capabilities ... so you build the bomb but it 's more of a let 's hope it 'll work guys . 
  then [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r2flrdsquk ) happened . 
  spain 82 . 
  never forget !, 
  all your country being split in two and no access to the bomb . 
   because project fear  ) oh my what a good laugh . 
  yeah economists saying : do n't do that , investors do n't like uncertainties ... it will increase distrust in the economy . 
  just keep the ship steady guys . 
  is project fear . 
  mkay . 
   investors are not entirely rational people . 
  and the leavers are ? 
   some investors like risk yeah . 
  i 'm sure vulture capitalists are really the type of people you wan na attract because they 're long term investors . 
  right ? 
   it 's likely to be what the central bank does in england the central bank can not do miracles . 
  a lot of the economy depends on the connections it has with europe . 
  for example . 
  15 % of the gdp depends on the finance industry . 
  a fair amount of that depends on uk having a financial passport to access the rest of the eu . 
  if uk doesnt want to remain in the eea , then it wont have that financial passport . 
  it will suffer as businesses that want access to the eu market ( m & a for example ) will move on the continent and other global businesses might move to other areas of the globe . 
  ** lack of trust ** is the main issue here . 
  read s&p 's reasons http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-27/sp-downgrades-uk-aaa-aa-outlook-negative-full-text  we believe that the lack of clarity on these key issues will hurt confidence , investment , gdp growth , and public finances in the u.k. , and put at risk important external financing sources vital to the financing of the u.k. 's large current account deficits ( in absolute terms , the second-largest globally behind the u.s. ) . 
  so we 've seen your ignorance concerning what the single market is . 
  we 've seen your ignorance on what schengen is and now we can see your ignorance on the eu . 
  great job for showing us why the brits voted leave . 
   the markets need to calm down and become less volatile that can only happen when investors will know what uk will do in the future . 
  that is an unknown now . 
   i think you would do exactly what uk is doing . 
  and if you were an investor , would you invest in uk right now ? 
  not knowing if they 'll be in the eea or out ? 
  that affects the markets and that 's why uk 's rating with degraded by s&p for example . 
  there is lack of stability and just ignoring the issues wont bring in more stability . 
  there are 9.5 m polish americans , 1.5 m hungarian americans . 
  guess what country is in the visa waiver program and who isnt . 
   $ 2.57 b to romania , $ 1.69 b from romania . 
  it 's nothing to be sniffed at . 
  when you realise that there are 250k romanians in uk that will have a much harder that finding jobs etc if uk restricts freedom of labour . 
  those 250k romanians have families at home . 
  so at least 500k romanians with the right of vote would be pissed . 
  good luck convincing them of shit especially with your patronizing tone . 
   the uk is n't in schengen , and we have a boarder check - so free movement is not so free holy ... dude please tell me you 're under 18 . 
  i do n't wan na believe people like you were allowed to vote in that referendum . 
   in someone else 's country , with the alternative being a massive drop in trade . 
  ah yes . 
  the famous romania uk trade . 
  huuuge value to the economy . 
   i 'm willing to bet the electorate care more about the economy did the brexit leavers care about the economy ? 
   voters vote for feelz . 
  and that 's why you have quite a few leavers leaving the boats . 
  you should have said any non subsaharian, 
   which is bad for the eu organization , but not for member states okay . 
  go convince romania to accept fewer rights for romanians ... and poland .
