  good luck with that  merkel can say all she likes , i wo n't believe a word from either side until the ink is dry on the new deal . 
  merkel , hollande a ton of eu politicians . 
  but hey ... feels  reals, 
   dastardly ~ ~ foreign ~ ~ french metric !, 
  now you understand why, 
  yeah . 
  you might end up with something that is half baked . 
  so now we know the difference between the metric wit and the imperial wit . 
   well , only europeans have up to 3 % of neanderthal dna , it does n't concern other human groups . 
  what ? 
  native americans have some 6 % of neanderthal dna . 
  get outta here with your unscientific bs . 
  1 ) a country has the right to refuse access on its territory for any and all reasons . 
  they might decide not to let in blue eyed people . 
  that 's their right . 
  2 ) it does n't make any sense for the us to keep romania 's rates artificially high . 
  us is much closer politically to romania and poland than to greece for example or hungary . 
  same goes for your comment . 
  there 's little overstay because those that are likely to overstay do not get a visa . 
  wtf i the global financial center index ? 
  who the hell are z/yen the people that make it ? 
  so you do n't know jack about the finance world . 
  good . 
  no travel visa ! = work permit . 
  how about the rejection rate for visa demands . 
  the browner ones at least . 
  it also increases volatility . 
  no , because the parliamentary fn is only the 3rd largest party . 
  and the parliamentary elections immediately follow the presidential . 
  so it will be a landslide for the right . 
  fn ca n't even ally with another party that wants france to leave the euro and the eu because fn is political poison . 
  it 's just marine basically that is a valid politician . 
  and two-three more, 
   export more with a cheaper pound yeah i ca n't wait to buy ... uhm ... what do people buy from uk ? 
  financial services ? 
   pis has right-wing ideology but their social policies are more left-wing and so on . 
  where have i heard about that before ... hmm . 
  gosh darn i ca n't put my finger on it !, 
   why is that the european markets have fallen more then one 's valued in euros , the other in pounds ? 
  hey . 
  they took credit for chicken tikka masala, 
  it got about 30 % of the seats . 
  it just simply did n't win any region . 
  so i 'm not sure where you get your `` non democratic system '' system . 
  it 's not proportional but it 's still democratic . 
   8m voters have no representation where did you get those numbers ? 
  your ass does not count as a valid source of information . 
  you do realise that fn 's program is not just : `` get out of the eu now '' , right ? 
   and what he could do ? 
  play into benny , ksa and republican rhetoric and say the iranians did n't do enough and pull the plug on negotiations . 
  go see how obama was treated when visiting ksa . 
  why not mention how obama brokered the peace deal with iran and how that really pissed off the saudis ? 
  how he removed the sanctions on iran so now it can once again compete with saudi arabia for power in the region ? 
  seems a bit like an attention whore trying to intervene in every situation . 
   is much more pro-saudi than obama , obama 's pro-saudi ? 
  yeah sure . 
  fn got 3.5 votes in the parlamentary elections in the first round . 
  .8 in the second . 
  2 seats . 
  the migrant crisis is not our problem . 
  he acted well in that situation by not participating . 
  we 'll probably get at most 20-30-40k syrians and the refugee issue simply does ** not ** exist in political debates nowadays in france . 
  that 's a good thing . 
   everyone voting against her ? 
  then she should change her politics to be more appealing . 
  or move to a country that has archaic systems like fptp, 
  it was a failure for them . 
  they did n't win any region . 
  marine is being slowed down by her party of nobodies and racists . 
  add to that the main issue : her stance on the eu and euro is not really appealing to people . 
  not to mention that the turn out for regionals is 55 % while for pres it 's 80 % . 
  different ball game . 
   the front national got the most votes at the latest elections ) , the latest elections were not the eu parliament but the regionals in 2015 dec.fn was the 3rd party behind ump and ps . 
  and either way you can not compare them with the presidential elections since they 're very much different . 
   intergovernmentalist gaulliste gaulliste does n't mean much nowadays . 
   but i do n't see how he is europhile he 's for a fiscal union under the euro . 
  de gaulle would killed the euro since it undermines france 's independence . 
   therefore airing it was a breach of journalistic ethics i doubt they breached that . 
   undermines the trust relationship generations of journalists have built . 
  journalists should like the 4th estate . 
  their primary interest is to serve the people and to keep them informed . 
  the guy was having a friggin logorrhoea attack in front of a camera . 
  at his age and experience he should know better . 
   what does madalin voicu know about iliescu 's blood line ? 
  a very important member of the psd knows more about iliescu than you will ever do . 
  jupp\u00e9 is hardly a soft eurosceptic . 
  he 's full on europhile, 
   successtory eurosceptics will gain double the support back . 
  except that few countries have the benefits uk has . 
  uk would have to become a super success story : to the levels of switzerland for people to start thinking about bailing out ... 
  i wo n't hold my breath . 
  want me to give you a lesson in french politics and why le pen 's get out of the euro and eu is the sole reason they never have any results ... ** even after ** the worst terrorist attack in french history ? 
  here ya go buddy . 
  numbers and shit https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/40nru4/dear_europeans_what_are_the_most_astonishing_or/cywinxb, 
  wow . 
  they use trams as tractors [ over there ] ( http://araw.eu//layout/top_1_2.png ), 
  because orban wants to cooperate on the refugee issue ? 
   thinking they can actually vote or decide anything hexit ? 
  europe is looking a bit too plump . 
  needs to shed some weight .
