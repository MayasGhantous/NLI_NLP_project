   should n't be a decision made by germany alone . 
  yeah . 
  cuz germany decided that that should happen . 
  there are unknown unknowns in this system . 
   this is speculative value . 
  unless you know ... you wan na borrow money to invest . 
  but that never happens right ? 
  `` dense and glutonous cake '' . 
  i know someone who 's dense and glutonous . 
   unsure which . 
  if it helps ... it 's on / r/europe . 
  i 'll just vote for the guy that tells me they 'll ignore hungary and this silly referendum . 
  nobody asked me if hungary should have been allowed to join the eu . 
  or plus catholique que le pape . 
  who let the kittens out ? 
  how about the roof ? 
  you guys want tourists to visit with that traffic ? 
  and it looks like raining ... pff . 
  so a famous french youtuber has romanian roots . 
  your point being ? 
  is he the famous arab from marseille that is racist against romanians ? 
   your racist foreigners . 
  they think romanians are dirty thieves and that they 're so much better than everyone else ? 
  you have n't been to marseille have you ? 
  i 'm fine . 
  it 's normal we all have them . 
  racist foreigners ... wtf ? 
  dude . 
  they should come to france . 
  our cleaning people , garbage people etc are either arab or black . 
  it 's be fun to have a brit . 
   they are not gypsy . 
  you do know that gypsies are n't just people that wear flowery dresses and pick your pockets right ? 
  concerning iliescu , here you have voice saying he has gypsy origins http://m.ziuanews.ro/dezvaluiri-investigatii/madalin-voicu-nici-ion-iliescu-nu-recunoaste-ca-are-origini-tiganesti-124911 he might be a crook but he 's an exceptionally shrewd and aware politician . 
  concerning nastase ... sources are somewhat nsfw but believable . 
  neah . 
  i meant the racist shitheads . 
  you joke but it 's part of reality . 
  similar to how converts to new religions tend to be more anal than people who were born in that religion . 
  they see it as the need to surpass themselves in order to fit in . 
  because you have just ** one ** job to give in the uk and you can either hire an it worker or an ee labourer ? 
  in this article : people who historically suffered racism turn out to be xenophobic , 
  well thanks for taking those people out of the eu for us , mate  you did us a solid . 
   so i guess they did n't change much after 700 years in europe , you do realise that a lot of gypsies integrated right and we 're assimilated ? 
  if someone has a gypsy grandpa , you ca n't really read it on his face . 
  that 's why you have people like iliescu or nastase that have gypsy background . 
   of that 230.000 , how many are actually underpaid ? 
  [ 77k are polish and romania ] ( http://www.journaldunet.com/management/pratique/contrats/18580/le-travailleur-detache-en-france.html ) so fair to say 77k are . 
   france has many more serious problems that this ( failed economic model , terrorism and failed integration to name a few ) so no need to add more to the pile . 
  also what foreign workers working here have to do with terrorism ? 
  or is that your `` to go '' speech . 
  time to criticize france : failed immigration . 
  time to criticize germany : the greek situation . 
  time to criticize uk : brexit . 
  if you ca n't talk on point , do n't talk at all . 
   i regards this overwhelming as anti-eu populism . 
  if you work in france for more than 6 months you should pay your dues to the state . 
  end of story . 
  2 years is waaay too long . 
   saying it would be disadvantageous to them you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  they should compete on the french job market like any other company would . 
   but often central european workers outcompete locals ones on with the same salary . 
  so let the workers that are abroad get the same salary as the ones they 're working with then . 
   there might exists a few examples of unfair wages there are 230000 in france . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/emploi/article/2015/02/11/le-travail-detache-a-encore-fortement-augmente-en-2014_4574620_1698637.html you 're in france , you use french roads hospitals etc , you should therefore pay your due to the french state if you work here . 
   but how many of those who graduate from a western university will ever come back ? 
  only some - and why is that ? 
  you also have a ton of italians , germans , swedish , irish , polish etc that moved to the us . 
  you have a ton of italians , portuguese , polish , algerians etc that moved to france . 
  they become part of the local communities there , they become part of the history of their new country and such is life ... 
  i have no idea how you calculated that . 
  they read a comment on the guardian and they started to believe they 're in house of cards or something ... 
  do people still think brexit wont happen ? 
  by that logic , the us congress should be the most fully functional democratic body in the world . 
  in reality it shows a disfunctional society . 
  people feel disenfranchised and they feel their vote does not matter anymore . 
  there is a disconect in the society . 
  in my case , i just became desensitised.i tried to hang on as hard as i could but ... it was simply too much ridiculousness . 
  it does n't really work like that . 
  finance needs money . 
  if you have the money ... you 'll get a financial service . 
  london needs access to the european market for its various m & a activities for example.which will probably move on the continent, 
  do they want it so badly ? 
  pinging / u/ar -74 , / u/omnicide , / u/angelsandinsx : did n't happen !, 
  * hon hon hon *, 
  it 's no secret that france wants to get some of that sweet city activity moved on the continent . 
  where ? 
  who knows ? 
  really nobody knows what will happen . 
   that sounds ideal did you or / u/sulod read the whole thing ( emphasis mine ) :  crucially , a ceta-type deal would ** not ** give uk financial services the eu market access that they have now . 
  it would be hard for london-based banks to get `` passporting '' rights for their services in the eu - rights that they value hugely now . 
  well you 'll want a financial passport so much more than what canada gets . 
  well he apparently [ did say he 'll raise taxes and cut spending ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-warns-uk-to-expect-spending-cuts-and-tax-rises-after-brexit-vote-a7106921.html ) . 
   does n't the anti-eu side have a majority in france and some other countries right now ? 
  imagine i open my own wealth management fund in france . 
  since there 's trade of services then i can sell you my services without having a branch in uk . 
  now imagine france blocks free movement . 
  how will you come to france if you wan na ask for advice ? 
  if you wan na file a complaint ? 
  what if i steal your money and you 'll have to sue me ?
