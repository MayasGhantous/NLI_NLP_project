  it 's much much better and faster to do it in france and not through some international complaint system . 
  understand wy you need freedom of movement now ? 
  way more swiss live in france 180k and way more french live in switzerland . 
   are not lenient , but smarter and more beneficial for the real world tell that to the pollution we see in cities like paris ... we should begin scrapping diesel . 
  at least for city dwellers . 
  the city needed that blow to manage the troubling times that are afoot . 
   for lawmakers fraud has to be determined by lawmakers with the help of experts . 
   taxing his toymaking operation . 
  wo n't anyone think of the children ? 
   , you do it if the methodology is demonstrably wrong . 
  yes . 
  and if someone reaches thr conclusion that jews are inferior or that the holocaust never happened then they committed fraud at one point or another . 
  no one can honestly argue that the friggin holocaust never happened . 
  people who argue that are anti-semites and frauds . 
   do you want a referendum on death penalty ? 
  if that is what the french want , then so be it . 
  if your purpose is to do controversial stuff in history or science , i 'd recommend not considering a career in those areas . 
  a historian that denies the holocaust is the same thing as a doctor saying he found a gene that shows that the jews are selfish greedy and untrustworthy . 
  aka such a person would be a fraud . 
  now the question : if you commit fraud in your work , should be sanctioned ? 
  the answer is obviously yes . 
  laws pass because people agree with them . 
  i do n't see a huge outpour of anger against these laws like for example you travail ... 
  hey . 
  garbage in garbage out . 
  your comment is non sensical ... what if in the future they 'll discover that the holocaust was n't a genocide ? 
  wtf ? 
  if you have proof the holocaust did n't happen , let 's see it . 
   `` the earth is flat '' is an opinion too , okay . 
  i 'll end this conversation because you can not make the difference between a fact and an opinion . 
  bandwagon fallacy applies to ** facts ** . 
  saying `` holocaust denial is a human right '' is ** not a fact ** . 
  it is an opinion and as such it can and has been struck down . 
  you should learn about fallacies before using them . 
  in your country you are free to vote however you wish . 
  in my country tryi am allowed to vote however i wish . 
   i despise the idea of having laws interfering in the work of historians has any historian been jailed because of holocaust denial laws ? 
   you 're essentially preventing people from speaking out what speaking up ? 
  did any holocaust historian got locked up because this law ? 
  this is a law to prevent shit heads from speaking up and using solely their ignorance as proof . 
  well once 50 % +1 french think like you , you can change the law . 
  do 50 % +1 french think like you ? 
  cool . 
  i 'm from france . 
  our own citizens starting grabbing oter citizens . 
  men women and children in the thousands and sent then to death camps . 
  so i accept the fact that we as a group , in order to show homage and how serious the crimes we let happen were , we will give away some of our rights . 
  you commit a crime , you get sent to jail . 
  this is my version of punishment and i accept it fully . 
  it stopped le pen from spewing his bullshit . 
  so that 's a win . 
  do you know french legislation ? 
  try and say the holocaust did n't happen and come back to us with the results . 
   think about that for a second . 
  think about [ this ] ( http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=en ) for a second . 
  your consistent failures to help the more fragile in your country : the older and poorer demographics brought the brexit . 
  compare with france . 
  half the poverty rate dude . 
  older people vote fn out here . 
  look at [ poverty rates ] ( http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=en ) and compare with france . 
  up to the age of 50 , poverty is the same as in france . 
  thing is ... in uk it continues to stay at the same rate for older people while in france it dips to half the rates you see in the uk . 
  now consider who voted for brexit . 
  older people . 
  even though logically older people are the ones most against change ( in france it is older people that consistently vote fn out of power ) . 
  poor , older people voted uk out . 
  did germany ask for the extradition of von braun ? 
  because france did ask for klaus barbie . 
  we 'll continue this convo when you 'll find those wmds . 
  cheers . 
   you mean overthrowing brutal dictatorships i mean the whole fake wmd thing  but thanks for the `` democratic govt '' thing . 
  made me chuckle :d, 
   hell , a huge percentage of our youth are europhiles . 
  how many americans live in europe and how many europeans live in the us ? 
  hardly a clusterfuck of the order of iraq and afghanistan ... and was n't obama complaining that sarkozy stole the thunder there even though the us did the most ? 
  ford has been pursuing global cars for 40 years now . 
  we 're talking here about the appeal brands have because we can associate them with their country of provenance . 
  hot hatchbacks are n't exactly distinctly american the way muscle cars are . 
  you can eat wisconsin brie and it 's probably very good . 
  but that does n't automatically make it american cheese . 
  well for the record ... the last time european countries started shit in the world was 50 years ago ( colonial wars for example in algeria ) . 
  last time the us started shit in the world is much more recent . 
  the actions of your govt have a reflection on you as a people . 
  ford fiesta was never produced in the us . 
  and it took 30 years so you can buy the first fiesta in the us . 
  tell me more how fiesta is an american classic like the transam or the shelby mustang . 
   distortion , exaggeration , aggressivity , just by mentioning vichy !, 
  yeah we 're all nazis !, 
   deportation of whole villages and colonization with russians or ukrainians was employed in order to denationalize the overwhelming roumanian majority . 
  and the process of deportation stopped in 1917 . 
  i fail to understand your point . 
  how does people got there is irrelevant . 
  they 're there . 
  you can only remove them through a new series of deportations but as you know two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  russification stopped in 1917 -1919 when bessarabia joined romania, 
  why ? 
   guess when and where those russians and ukrainians came from in the span of 100 years . 
  :-) it does n't matter . 
  once they 're populated it 's done . 
  or do you approve of stalinist like deportations ?
