   it is exciting not to know the future well you 're [ bursting of joy apparently ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/27/investing/barclays-rbs-stock-suspended-brexit/ ) . 
  might want to tone it down a little . 
   to be able to discuss it openly . 
  you might want to talk about it [ less openly ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/brexit-racism-eu-referendum-racist-incidents-politicians-media ) ? 
  not sure everyone appreciates such a [ direct debate ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/racist-incidents-feared-to-be-linked-to-brexit-result-reported-in-england-and-wales ) . 
  you romanians should learn that eindhoven is not in holland ( olanda ) but in north brabant which is in netherlands ( tarile de jos ) . 
  make an effort guys ... geesh, 
  you had a 0.4 % growth in q1 ... you don ' ( have a lot of space to maneouvre . 
  how many marriages will romania tear appart until this infamy stops ? 
  because uk is so successful at solving problems ... a country where its future even in 4 months is unknown . 
  we could try to blame it on immigrants but i do n't think it would be as helpful as there : /, 
  okay fiiine . 
  then gs analysts http://fortune.com/2016/06/27/goldman-sachs-britain-recession-brexit/, 
   see we can not agree on that so why you have to blame merkel for her view ? 
  there will be general meeting soon ... but if her general attitude will be `` guys we 'll solve this issue later '' then we 'll have a big eu problem on our hands . 
  so ... the most proeminent figure in the leave campaign does n't know shit about politics ? 
   but please we are in 4th day after the vote . 
  well it would have been nice to have prepared a joined statement . 
  hollande went one way , merkel went another way , the foreign ministers of the 6 went the way of hollande kinda , cameron went a 3rd way . 
  and juncker probably a 4th way , i dunno . 
  that 's amateur hour in europe . 
   what would you do now ? 
  ** unified ** statement from the 27 saying britain has to act fast . 
  slow down as possible naming a new uk commissioner . 
  did merkel even prepare anything ? 
  or was she caught completely off guard ? 
  so i should go with my gut feeling ... because it has to be so right ? 
  that makes sense to you ? 
   that 's the sociopathy i 'm talking about . 
  you should look in the definition of sociopathy . 
  asking for proof is n't sociopathy . 
  cheers . 
   if we would push the u.k. now even harder do you think this would be stabilizing the market ? 
  giving cameron 3 months time to resign ** plus ** finding a new pm ** plus ** giving that new pm some more time to decide when to trigger art 50 . 
  and after that 2 more years of negociations . 
  if cameron said he 'll resign there is ** no fucking reason ** to wait 3 months . 
  what will happen in 3 months that wont in 1 ? 
  the popular vote is cast , he can not launch another referendum . 
  eu should : * with the uk : make a statement reassuring the markets * press uk through any legal means to force cameron to stop down asap . 
  the guy 's dead weight , the markets wont magically become stable . 
  again , people do n't know where to invest , where to put their money . 
  the eu and especially uk is poison atm . 
  merkel should also give a sense of urgency about the matter  if we would push the u.k. now even harder do you think this would be stabilizing the market ? 
  people want solutions and quick resolves to problems , even if not the best but good enough . 
  merkel apparently wants to wait the heat death of the universe . 
   we should blame the vote campaign leaders for having no plan , not the u.k. as a whole . 
  thats sweet and dandy ... but economic crashes do n't give a shit about how you voted ... 
  well the mighty leader farange ? 
   effect on polling . 
  well ... 
  i have yet to see one serious article claiming that it did have an effect on polling . 
  either way ... immigration was a * huge * issue for the leavers . 
  easily in the top 2 . 
  so cameron fucked up bringing the poll in this period ... 
   i also see no gain for destabilizing the u.k. even more , not for the u.k. and not for the e.u. 
  again ... have you seen the markets ? 
  is that your image of stability ? 
  what 's the purpose of waiting it out ? 
  will the markets calm down ? 
  no because they still do n't know what will happen . 
  will uk leave the eu ? 
  will uk leave the eea ? 
  these are all ** huge ** issues that have to be decided quickly because until they are , no one will touch the eu and ** especially ** uk . 
  would you invest in uk now ? 
  or in the eu ? 
  it 's a gridlock and investors have 0 certainties . 
  if you remember 2008 a gridlock with 0 certainties is a * bad * thing . 
  pulling a merkel and waiting it out wo n't solve shit ... 
  huh ? 
  / u/pablopeublo is saying that immigration was n't an issue in this referendum because jo cox was murdered . 
  that 's a stupid point . 
  where 's the sociopathy ? 
  i try to encourage people , especially when they do a great job on showing what a fucking bad idea it is to leave the eu , 
  did n't they have time * before * the referendum ? 
  merkel is again dragging her feet but the problem is that markets will just go down and down and down because of the huge uncertainties . 
   deutsche bank & santander stock have fallen 20 % the last three days . 
  yeah . 
  barclays lost 20 % today ...  but do n't realize their house is burning down too . 
  uk is burning faster . 
  europe can take a few years of indecision with markets not knowing what the future will be ... right ? 
   you can blame merkel 's handling of the crisis for the brexit . 
  the crisis had already started for a long time before merkel started making her speeches in october ... 
   a dip that 's only so far gone as low as februar bullshit . 
  was that a one day decrease ? 
  volatility fucking matters and now it 's big . 
  barclays and rbs lost about 25 % since thrusday and they froze their stock today . 
  meaning tomorrow it will drop worse . 
  and your knight in shinning armour just said you 're heading for a recession : http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/nigel-farage-ukip-britain-recession-brexit so good luck with that buddy . 
   move along people , there 's nothing to see here . 
  you know what 's funny ? 
  in the recession that will follow , you 'll lose waaay more money than what you would have given the eu for * decades * . 
  good job buddy . 
  you do realise you 'll have a recession on your hands soon enough right ? 
  as bad as two major uk banks having to call it a day because * it was that bad * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4q2so6/barclays_and_the_royal_bank_of_scotland_the_2nd/, 
  lem me help out right here . 
  / u/diosio was being * sarcastic * ... all better now ? 
   a pro-remain mp was murdered by a pro-brexit fascist literally three days before the referendum . 
   it still did n't stop brexit happening why would it ? 
  i do n't think you understand cause and effect ... edit : do you really think immigration stopped being a major issue in the campaign because jo cox was murdered ? 
  think his show is more addressed to americans though .
