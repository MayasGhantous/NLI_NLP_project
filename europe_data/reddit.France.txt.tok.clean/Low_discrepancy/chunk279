  i think people are blaming him for the timing . 
  we 're going through a migratory crisis and one of the main issues that was a concern for the brits was immigration . 
  also major terrorist attacks in europe ... 
   banker neah those will move to the continent :d . for he rest , no one needs to panick . 
  there will be free movement ... uk will be cut out of the free market without it . 
   high concentrated cash directly highly concentrated * dollars * . 
  this is the pound we 're talking about here . 
  350m pounds is about 3 fiddy . 
  it a prank bruv !, 
  [ in the hood ] some people are too thin skinned, 
   we decided to leave but will you ? 
  because that 's not super clear who will trigger art . 
  who will be that pm :d . 
  kosovo is already included in the statistics for serbia ... * shots fired *, 
  ah censitary vote . 
  thanks . 
   the thing is confirmed as a 4chan prank the guy was complaining about people signing the petition not about the fake entries . 
  a lot also are n't fake . 
  get used to it now that uk is out . 
  well actually 4/5ths of a term . 
  he 'll either get a norway deal so still free movement and no immigration control or he 'll get his country even more fucked and even a worse recession that the one that 'll start . 
  and and scotland independence ... 
  you can not possibly * still * think brexit is a good idea , can you ? 
  he 'll be pm during a recession . 
  how do you think he 'll fare ? 
  / r/europe is somewhere between right and center right . 
  so not here . 
  the euro did n't have its worse day since 1985 to cushion the fall of the dax and cac . 
  but like farange said , the recession you 'll get was expected and not caused at all by the brexit , 
   but boris is the most likely future pm right now . 
  and he 'll have to trigger art 50 and it will be ugly . 
  a recession and very likely huge huge issue with scotland wanting its independence . 
  it 'll be tough and people will eventually turn against him . 
  he 'll have one term but not more . 
  yes . 
  you claim those people exist . 
  exhibit one !, 
  we 're talking here about people that thought it through carefully . 
  spend time mulling this decision to arrive to :  a belief that it was best for the future of our country like / u/zaltps2 if you thought hard on such a vital decision and concluded that boris is anti-establishment ... you might be friggin dumb . 
  ** or ** you went dick slinging and full on irrational mode ... 
  i think it 's the latter . 
  nope . 
  / u/blussy96 could n't find anyone : / but that mythical person apparently exists because polls or something . 
  the venetians got some benefits from that particular crusade and the sack of constantinople . 
  maybe that 's what / u/piekenier was implying, 
  french politicians should heed notice and push for uk exit . 
  mo ' jobs for here , in germany and ireland . 
  it 's okay , we can impose harsh restrictions on uk concerning their banking industry to force them to move to the continent . 
  you snooze you lose . 
  the sauce is good . 
  people in that area of the industry know it . 
   business groups then issued a statement demanding the restriction of ngo yeah we tend to be quite [ protective of ngos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinking_of_the_rainbow_warrior ), 
  smth smth democratic process smth smth ... 
  so what you 're saying is move along nothing to see here . 
  just something blown out of proportions ? 
  since you sound american we should remind you that 73 % of british voted . 
  the last time 73 % of americans voted on their presidential election was in [ 1904 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voter_turnout_in_the_united_states_presidential_elections#/media/file:voter_turnout.png ) you have way bigger issues with voter turnout compared to uk or france . 
   but i agree with you on the statement . 
  we should get the youths to be as motivated as the oldies . 
   most of these are hearsay . 
  i kinda agree with you . 
  this is n't a high level post . 
  it 's disgusting but i do n't think one can infere something from there . 
   at least with a uk parliament if we dont agree with a law or politician it can be changed or they can be kicked out . 
  the vast majority of eu politicians are elected ( directly or indirectly ) in their countries . 
  the only problematic thing is the eu parlament not being able to initiate laws but besides that meh . 
  the eu is about as democratic as uk is . 
  when complaining about eu democracy remember you fucked over scotland too ... 
  til boris and gove are anti-establishment . 
   lots of people in here mad that they are going to lose the handouts do n't get salty mlp doesnt win shit  it 's not polite . 
  so which one is it : * rejection of the political establishment or * a belief that it was best for the future of our country because it cant be both . 
   a union incapable of keeping one of its most important members from leaving needs to move on . 
  why exactly ? 
  yeah . 
  clearly it 's the eu 's fault for the bs politic shitshow uk went through . 
  how about if we give you netherlands ^ * in exchange for her ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ * hollande, 
   would she really be politically better off as the woman who went against 52 % of the british public uhm ... she gets her votes from scotland . 
   many of those who voted leave did not do so in a spiteful sense of superiority but a belief that it was best for the future of our country sure . 
  many but not most , 
   if i buy a data package in the netherlands i 'll only pay 0,05 on top of the normal cost ? 
  your phone company should have a huge list of prices for data , phone calls , texts for each country . 
  i recommend going through the website of your provider to find that particular list . 
  i paid 0.05 cents per mb because in france i 'd also pay 0.05 cents for that data ( though when i 'm in france i have a certain amount that is free and i do n't think i had that in italy ) . 
  obviously that depends on the carrier . 
  i agree with probably 80 % of your comment . 
  the thing is people are in the situation where the no longer vote rationally . 
  they want social protection fast and they 're not exactly open minded people . 
  they 'll turn against the first people hey can : immigrants . 
  you now have two groups of people . 
  the extreme left ( in this scenario the extreme left have become what we would have called the left 30-40 years ago , because what 's now called the left is just a neo-liberalist mishmash ... social dems if you will ) talk about banks , about multinationals hiding money in the caymans and dodging taxes , social security etc. 
  the extreme right that talks about * exactly * the same issue ** but ** adds immigrants . 
  the scary people that speak weird languages and take your housing . 
  if you were in their situation who would you pick ? 
  your idealism is killing your goals . 
  just remember that old leftists used to be protectionists . 
  i 'm simply asking if you met * one * person . 
  not many . 
  just * one * that said that . 
  the polls did n't ask : did you switch because of cox .
