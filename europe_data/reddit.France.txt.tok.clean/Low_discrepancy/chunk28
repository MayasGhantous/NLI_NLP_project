  if so , i 'll have to see the rest of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 man . 
   i am just saying how i experience things are here at the office , the french are the ones people laugh the most at , always has been and forever will be . 
  oh god , that salt makes me feel so good . 
  wow . 
  i am bathing in it . 
   i did n't when france was attacked and i wont do it now either . 
  yes you are the bigger man indeed . 
  :d . with you , salt never tasted so sweet though . 
   do n't stop . 
  i 'm having fun . 
  tell me moar about the french . 
  it 's so gewd : s, 
  can you explain the joke ? 
  i do n't get it in the context of this story . 
   e form of news articles out there that show how belgians blame no one but themselves and how they 're calling for a change of the system . 
  how about charles michel saying yeah they were fearing a terrorist attack . 
  if they feared that why did n't they do squat ? 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/03/01/ce-que-savait-la-police-belge-sur-les-freres-abdeslam_4874375_3214.html listen what they said after the terrorist attack :  on a vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019amateurisme le plus total & nbsp ;  france , the french and its shitty non-reformist government will forever be the butt of most people 's jokes . 
  the salt . 
  man be careful , you 'll get hypertension from all that salt  . 
  i like it though . 
   having read your posts here lately , thank you . 
  it 's always nice to have a follower . 
   kicking belgium when it is down . 
  i kick the govt and police while telling the people they can get and deserve better . 
   he was n't the most wanted man in belgium ibrahim el bakraoui ** rented the apartment in forest used by abdeslam to hide in ** . 
  i read his name in the press friday a week ago . 
  before the terrorist attacks . 
   he was sent to the netherlands , walked out the airport in amsterdam and then disappeared in the most densely populated area of europe . 
  ah yes . 
  the guy was running free for months . 
  clearly nothing can be done . 
   the belgians made mistakes ** bullshit ** the belgian govt and police made mistakes . 
  that 's why 2 ministers sent their resignation letters . 
  it was a fuck up . 
  not all the belgians . 
  but again i see nuances are too complicated for you . 
  i do n't know about belgium but in france such a thing would be illegal and go against what makes france france . 
  we are a secular state and we 're proud to be that . 
  30 % are convinced atheists , 35 % are non-religious . 
  we wo n't start changing france because 1000 nutters . 
  ( also because it would n't work , the crazies will just say the imams are financed by kuffars and sionists so you ca n't trust them and with the internet they 'll have a free access to saudi arabian bs ), 
   no imaams who call for the destruction of europe or who vocally support antisemitism . 
  i really doubt these people became radicals by going to your regular vanilla mosque . 
  and the nutjobs will say these are imams sponsored by the kuffars and sionist , you can not trust them etc etc. 
  and with internet it 's easy to find a nutjob preacher that tells you the bs you wan na hear . 
   let 's bomb its capital it 's a hellhole anyway ' & nbsp ;  hyperbolic if you want to be consistent , apply the same logic to yourself . 
  i explained what he said and why . 
  stop freaking out , nobody really suggested it . 
  it was a hyperbolae , since you use the word so much . 
   and since not everybody will do this , image campaigns are sadly deemed necessary by the government ** since ** the campaign talks about the fact that there are no terrorists attacks in belgium , it should ** also ** mention the fact that they 're fearing terrorist attacks . 
  ever heard about lying by omission ? 
  belgium was in the 3rd state of alert out oof 4 for terrorist attacks . 
  ya know ... add a disclaimer ... if you wan na be factual . 
  or paint a rosy picture and reap the results . 
   so the attacks that happened on french soil by french citizens is also belgium 's fault ? 
  the abdeslam brothers never lived in france . 
  it seemed like a country wide thing though not one or two mosques . 
   bombing molenbeek bullshit calm yo tits . 
  it was just an extreme right commentator and he was obviously joking . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/article/2015/11/17/rtl-soutient-zemmour-qui-veut-bombarder-molenbeek_4812124_4809495.html he 's saying we 're doing war with saudi arabia which is just like isis . 
  he 's saying we 're quick to do war outside and ** ignore the problems at home . 
  ** which you are doing right now . 
   claiming it 's immoral to actually put up a campaign to correct this hyperbolic bullshit is plain stupid . 
  is it hyperbolic ? 
  really ? 
  belgium has the highest per capita rate of isis fighters in the western world . 
  is that a hyperbolae ? 
  or is it factual  to ignore that what 's happening in their countries and the involvement of their citizens ah yes . 
  we have a prime example right here . 
   batteling a battered reputation by avoiding the heavy issues . 
  seems plausible af well the campain was a lie . 
  ** your pm charles michel said he was fearing a terrorist attack , yet you guys released this bs campaign . 
  ** http://www.sudinfo.be/1519624/article/2016-03-22/charles-michel-nous-redoutions-un-attentat-et-c-est-arrive-il-y-a-de-nombreux-mo his words :  we were fearing a terrorism attack and it has happened . 
  there are many dead people . 
  ** why did they lie ** to people with such a false campaign ? 
  and i doubt your publicity stunt is that plausible now . 
  i do n't know how i 'll be able to sleep safely at night now . 
   just spend 5 minutes with your doc . 
  who 'll make sure you know the risks , the usage and check that you are healthy enough to take it . 
  he will also know which brand to prescribe in case you have health issues like allergies . 
  if it for women that use it  every monday after hooking up on weekends without thinking ahead . 
  like you say , why not simply have 1 meeting that tells her the risks and that 's it . 
  it 'll be good for all her lifetime does she need 5 minutes every week to meet the doctor ? 
  i 'm sure people remember these things after the 2nd or 3rd time . 
  one could also mention that in the belgian mosques they refused to hold a minute of silence or a prayer for the victims ( no prayer for the kuffars ) . 
  they condemned the attacks though . 
  sauce : https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4bx3sf/dans_les_mosquees_pas_de_prieres_pour_les/ edit : the article mentions the council of theologians gave those recommendations to the mosques ( no prayers for non-believers and no minute of silence ) , i have no idea about the different islamic organisations in belgium . 
  / u/njuffstrunk said that the mosques did hold a minute of silence and of prayer for all the victims . 
  ** edit2 : ** the muslim executive of belgium said that they never held such comments and blame it on shoddy journalism . 
  http://www.embnet.be/default.aspx?base since le soir is a credible journal and they 've given their sources `` micha\u00ebl privot and radouane attiya '' , but the muslim organisations involved deny making such a decision . 
  well that 's about it , take things with a pinch of salt . 
  it is in poor taste to claim all is fine after the paris attacks were planned in molenbeek . 
  and one of the main people responsible were still on the run in bruxelles . 
  that 's from the moral side . 
  from the logical side : ** any ** marketting firm should know how to create campaigns that do n't backfire . 
  putting people that say :  so any guys with guns and bombs running about ? 
  is a ** baaaad ** idea . 
  because you can not guarantee the future . 
  you put soft stuff like hey look people hugging or couples walking hand in hand in grande place , you put scenery from the parks and talk about the fries .
