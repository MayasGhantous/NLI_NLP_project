  i 'd be happy if you 'd tell me you met just * one * . 
  so ask corbyn if he wants to boot polish workers outside of uk ? 
   no , but the polls okay i stopped reading there . 
  after the utter failure of the polls , no argument should ever start with : `` you see , the polls said ... '', 
   just enough to make it your last purchase . 
  so basically you 're saying you want protections ... kinda beats the point of trade deals ... does n't it ? 
  let 's face it ... no trade deal can function if you sell a good at a certain price in one country and 50 % cheaper in another country . 
   why do people still think there 's a vast swathe of untapped lefties ? 
  same thing in france . 
  they ( the extreme left ) just keep dreaming there 's some magical lefty majority out there . 
  they just need to be more extremist about their views and that majority will gush like old faithful . 
  / u/sunken-duck and / u/thinkscout have the classical belief `` how can people not vote extreme left ? 
  it 's all about love , acceptance , uniting people , having a multicultural diverse society , where no one is left behind '' they should actually meet a factory worker . 
  if they 're anything like in france , they 'd vote ukip . 
  and it 's not because the extreme left is n't too extreme in its demands . 
  if neo-liberalism is dying it 's not because people want even more open societies . 
  it 's because people want immigration to stop . 
  people want the return of some mythical past when they had a ton of power and people from other countries counted much less . 
   if corbyn can survive this then labour might stand a chance of becoming a real party for the left . 
   ) what are corbyn ' views on immigrants . 
  if they 're positive no chance in hell he 'll get reelected . 
  dude start being realistic about the situation your country is in . 
  because i 'm sure you met many people that said : i was going to vote leave but since jo cox i decided against that . 
   and by fun i mean devastating . 
  well i 'm french so ... fun is fun when it 's related to the brits :p, 
   new young party members , shame it 's also the groups of the people that did n't bother going to vote . 
  it 's a said day when trump says you did a good job . 
  and scotland might veto brexit :d oh lawdy lawd . 
  so much sweet drama . 
  nicola sturgeon says msps at holyrood could veto brexit - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36633244 i hope new countries will exit because i think i 'm addicted to so much panicking : /, 
  til . 
  thanks . 
   a smart indian will cover the transport cost across a 3rd of the globe to sell at the same price that he bought it for ? 
  you know you do n't need to transport the goods after you bought them right ? 
  and you know shipping does n't cost 50 % of the price of a product right ? 
   just think about this , 1 % of india 's population is equal to 1.5 germany . 
  that is fucking massive !, 
  yes and ? 
  what 's the gdp per capita of said population ? 
  germany is already happy selling it 's goods . 
  if we start a trade agreement with india either their standards of production go up or ours go significantly down . 
  we can not compete with the cost of work force there . 
  there is no need to harmonise standards with india . 
  the us is n't doing it . 
  we 'd be down right stupid to shoot ourselves in the foot and do it . 
   i just realised roaming fees are going to disappear in exactly one year in the eu they 're already down . 
  in may i was in spain . 
  the mb of data cost 0.25 euros . 
  in june i was in italy . 
  the mb of data was 0.05 ( same cost as in france ) . 
  the markets crashed because like idiots they thought brexit would fail . 
  do n't worry things will calm down ... for both the uk and the eurozone . 
  the credit crunch was different . 
  it was an utter gridlock . 
  people would stop borrowing and lending . 
  there was no liquidity on the market . 
  tons of banks were at the risk of bankruptcy . 
  has any bank come forward saying they 're at a risk of failure ? 
  that 's a nice comment but a bit too house or cardy . 
  cameron 's career is over . 
  he 'll have to resign . 
  the new pm can either decide to trigger or not article 50 . 
  either way his career is fucked . 
  ** but ** he has a secret 3rdoption : snap elections . 
  if the lib dems win on their promises to not trigger art . 
  50 , then boris can lay low for 5 years and afterwards play the : they did n't implement the vote of the people card ... you need another vote of the people in this situation . 
  since another referendum is not possible , you need a snap election ... 
   which they wo n't . 
  david cameron on / r/europe . 
  i feel honoured sir !, 
  if they wo n't allow it ... it 'll just create a ** bigger ** shitstorm . 
  :') thank you . 
  the drama you created is beautiful . 
  doubt eu zone will enter a recession . 
  scotland very likely to gain independence , careers of cameron and boris destroyed , corbyn to be ejected ... and now no us trade deal ? 
  brexit , the gift that keeps on giving . 
  at least they 'll have full control of their borders ... what 's that ? 
  free movement of people ? 
  and they say the eu is bureaucratic . 
  you 'd have more hassle cancelling your phone contract than leaving the eu . 
  uk ... thank you for the real life shitposts . 
  :') this is beautiful !, 
  way to miss the point . 
  you lower your price to sell more , yes but ** not ** to achieve ppp . 
  if you 'd try to sell to achieve ppp with india , you 'd have to offer a 50 % reduction . 
  and since you entered a trade agreement with india , if you sell in your country product x at price p and in india you sell it at price p/2 , a smart indian will resell your product in your country at price p/2 . 
  ( trade agreements are all about removing trade barriers ) . 
  congratulations you played yourself . 
   dropping the euro as their currency . 
  i want a source for that because this : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_bailout_referendum,_2015 does n't mention dropping the euro . 
   this would undoubtedly have ended with them being booted out the eu . 
  just like uk leaving the eu would undoubtedly mean they 'll get booted out of the eea ? 
  you have a lot of certainties about things that never happened . 
  so before 2012 the eu was perfect . 
  after 2012 , the eu was shit ? 
  fn is all about ** internal ** politics . 
  because nothing happened in the eu in 2012 but in france a socialist president was elected then ... you understand the concept of cause-effect right ? 
   ppp is the right measure ... fuck me . 
  dude sit down for an economics class . 
  let 's say i 'm italian and produce 1 burger that costs 10 euros .
