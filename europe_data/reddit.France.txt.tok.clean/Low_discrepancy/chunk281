  i sell it to another italian that eats it . 
  this economy has a gdp of 10 euros . 
  india being poorer , the same burger sells for 1 euro . 
  that gdp nominal is 1 euro . 
  the gdp ppp would be ** the same ** . 
  because ppp looks at the cost of living , inflation and other bs . 
  in this case it was the product itself : a burger . 
  gdp nominal just looks at the exact price . 
  and so the italian gdp nominal is ** 10 ** times larger . 
  international trade is about ** selling ** stuff . 
  eu wants trade deals so it can sell india stuff and make sweet money . 
  so if the italian chef sells that burger , it 'll want to sell it at 10 euros and ** not ** at 1 euro . 
  it 's the gdp nominal that counts and not the gdp ppp . 
  ppp means price parity . 
  that makes no fucking sense in international trade because we do n't sell at price parity . 
  we do n't sell airbus at one price for americans and at another price for indians to match their parity . 
  we sell them at ** one ** price . 
  please tell me you understand now why ppp in international trades means shit . 
   , or defaulting their debts and leaving the euro , which would require them to leave the eu . 
  holy fuck dude stop adding your opinions . 
  just like uk will leave the eu and not the eea , the greek ref was about refusing the bail-out and not leaving the eu . 
  when doing international trade ppp is ** the wrong ** measure . 
  ppp is used to measure different * internal * markets . 
  god man you really are clueless . 
  stop embarrassing yourself . 
   any of the big economies - ... india . 
  stopped reading there . 
  india is small fries . 
  its economy is at the level of italy . 
  do n't be thick ^ 1 as a leave voter . 
  / u/middleman79 is n't saying that ** all ** leave voters focus ** only ** on the browns and poles . 
  but a large part did since overall it 's the fucking number 2 concern . 
  and i 'm sure if you 'd do some closer analysis for large swaths of the leave group it was the number 1 issue . 
  honestly dude ... in such an important issue , having the boogeyman immigrants as your second most important issue . 
  and trying to downplay how ridiculous such a fear is . 
  1 : post the one with the level of education for leave and remain voters . 
   immigration was n't even the number one issue for leave voters . . ah okay . 
  it was the number 2 issue ... you proved us wrong mate . 
   any of the big economies - ... russia . 
  stopped reading there , cuz i knew the rest would be stupid . 
   they already voted overwhelmingly to leave the eu . 
  come again ? 
   i proposed a neutral arbiter why ? 
  what benefit would the eu or uk get from that ? 
  garbage in , garbage out . 
  paca . 
  tons of russians here :p . changed it during the april fool 's day and never bothered changing it back since there is no paca flair . 
   fn leading polls here , fn has ** nothing ** to do with the eu and ** everything ** to do with hollande . 
  in 2009 , fn was the ** 6th ** party in the french eu elections . 
  stop claiming it 's the eu when it 's just french voters throwing a tantrum . 
  when things matter , like the 2015 regional elections , fn does n't do shit . 
  dude you have only two arguments : * . 
  look canada 's currency fell and they 're doing ok * . 
  can/australie/nz will help uk in n\u00e9gociations against the eu . 
  they 're both stupid arguments . 
  canada is a country of 35 million people that have massive trade with the us . 
  if the us is doing well , canada will get a ton of business it 's way and do well . 
  and the us is doing well . 
  and your second argument ... 
  i do n't need to explain why it 's laughable . 
  / u/executivemonkey plays the role of the stereotypical american on / r/europe . 
  i thought people would know that by know :p he 's funny if you give him a chance, 
   ) darn what a ridiculous comment . 
  fun times . 
  so list the countries you want to help ^ 1 and those you want to leave alone ? 
  once you 've compiled such a list , go find how many political parties they have that want to restrict rights for their workers . 
  if those parties have 50 % +1 votes of the population ... come back to me . 
  1 : by removing their rights, 
   whatever you think of farage , i think he has done a great service to all europeans i think he has done a great service to me as a frenchman . 
  we can recuperate research funds , phd students that will be refused since they 're not british , etc. 
  scotland is also much more likely to gain its independence , the auld alliance should be renewed :d . airbus uk which is probably pull out and france being the likeliest candidates . 
  germany will also benefit since frankfurt will recuperate many activities done by the city : at least euro clearing houses since they were there because uk was in the eu . 
  and we can now impose as many restrictions on the city as we wish . 
  the eu will benefit as a whole since a fiscal paradise on its soil has disappeared . 
  as a strong federalist , i 've also won . 
  the franco-german alliance will only grow stronger . 
  and countries like denmark have lost a huge ally . 
  ( and maybe they 'll leave ? 
  one can dream ) . 
  like some people know here , i was for the brexit . 
  but do n't sell me bullshit like farange was some master mind . 
  he 's a populist and got a salary without putting work . 
   more like you need to read better ? 
  contrary to what you might think :  to be frank , i would n't be against some limitations on labour from ee to richer western nations . 
  is not a very complex phrase that allows for millions of nuances . 
  you want to restrict ee workers ' rights and they obviously wo n't agree with that ... because of course they wo n't . 
  what idiot would believe someone will say `` take away my rights because you know better than i do what 's good for me ''  are you lashing out now because you 're arguing against a straw man and i called you out on it ? 
  i am simply worried you might have memory loss problems . 
  this convo is done . 
  cheers . 
  translation : * of course they did n't vote . 
  they k ` new this circus will be soon over * . 
  is that why farange conceded defeat on the night of the referendum ? 
  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brexit-defeated-nigel-farage-concedes-remain-edges-victory-historic-eu-referendum-1567150 because he * magically * knew the result of the referendum ? 
  is it that hard to admit that like all populists , he makes great speeches but when actually * doing * democracy , they suck at it . 
  they 're the arm chair sunday coaches . 
  all words . 
  and they 're the friggin leaches of this system . 
  taking money for no work . 
  we saw it with me pen that abused the system and took money from the eu to pay for her own things .
