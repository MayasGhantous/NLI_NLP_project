   immigration was the deal-breaker . 
  i would much rather have uk leave the eu than have it erode free movement inside the eu . 
  this is all too complicated for my tiny brain ... 
  wish it could be explained in terms of feels . 
  seems like they already agreed to give free movement for croatians ... 
  i do n't know and i 'm sorry for the french swiss that voted against this referendum :p ( well it 's true ), 
  in 2014 , the swiss had their binding immigration reduction referendum . 
  it passed but switzerland can not restrict the free movement of eu citizens unless they want to start [ the guillotine clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillotine_clause ) which will remove them from the common market . 
  by 2017 , they have to decide which path they take . 
  ignore the result of the referendum and things will move on or implement it and see switzerland removed . 
  but seems like they already agreed to implement free movement for the croatians so probably they 'll just ignore the ref . 
  it 's enough for the eu to impose restrictions on the city . 
  do you think people will disagree with that ? 
  let them come to frankfurt . 
  speaking of the swissn what will they do come 2017 ? 
   i doubt he/she imported them just in order to rake this photo . 
  karma is a powerful drug . 
  in this case ... the op just downloaded it from the internet . 
  guess that settles my theory , 
  turkey might ask for a referendum to remove it 's bid to access the eu . 
  my point exactly :p, 
  yeah i fully , 100 % , agree with you . 
  you wo n't like them . 
  they 're pro-eu . 
  did n't he say that people did n't vote have to work to keep the result ? 
  hey . 
  we ca n't be sure what the result might be . 
  just like the last time , cameron might swoop in giving more benefits to scotland so that they remain in uk . 
   eu implied that scotland would n't be guaranteed entry we mostly stayed out of that issue since we did n't want to piss off england . 
  now ? 
  all bets are off . 
  if a referendum will take place to decide if scotland is allowed in the eu i 'll be boring hell yeah . 
  i admit his speech was nice and if he truly will disappear once the new pm is in place then okay . 
  he lost but he was gracious in his defeat . 
  but goddamn just look at that map . 
  he might have brought uk to the point of bursting . 
  and as we do n't remember fondly the 4th republic , nor will he be remembered kindly . 
  he put too much weight on his capability to get opt outs from the eu when that simply was n't possible . 
  he was a fuck up of a politician . 
  used the referendum as a political tool to obtain reelection ( on the back ground of an eu still reeling in from the credit crunch crisis and immigration crisis ) . 
  in order to seem like a white knight he goes to brussels demanding mo ' rights . 
  understandably the eu collectively decides meh we ca n't offer a ton of new opt outs because the eu does n't work like that . 
  so sorry mate . 
  has to come back to uk , tail between his legs trying to pretend that the meagre gains were massive so uk should deffo be in . 
  and now this shit storm ensues ( a country simply divided ) . 
  it was a poor political move . 
  he played a stupid game and won a stupid prize . 
  but that 's okay cuz i 'm lovin ' it . 
  yes . 
  but timing is also important . 
  it 's like having a referendum on the death penalty after a terrorist attack or something similar . 
  a lot of the issues were discussed under the light of the immigration issue for example . 
  if people think the syrian crisis is caused by the eu , bad times will insue . 
  go big or go home . 
  let 's hope you prove us wrong again by supporting a new scottish independence referendum  democracy will win . 
   that 's how a democracy works have you looked at the map ? 
  a new democratic vote will most likely happen soon : scottish independence referendum . 
   and eu ca n't just go up and about denying catalonians forever . 
  ifthe catalans gain independence through constitutional means yes . 
  if not : let 's cose up the borders guys . 
  assimilated . 
  anglosphere  ) good one . 
  next the oif will join the political ring right ? 
  fn is not a new creation , 
   i have never even heard of this guy . 
  me neither . 
  wikied him . 
  closed the page, 
  they 're irish do n't you see ? 
  plus they 're just tourists man . 
  stand up , [ for the little green men ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_green_men_ ( ukrainian_crisis \\ ) ), 
  uhm . 
  no one ** ever ** suggested that uk should accept 1 million refugees . 
  so stop acting like you dodged a bullet . 
  why do you think turkey is in such an amazing state you can not accept criticism ? 
  where we arrested 18k already http://europe.newsweek.com/18000-migrants-trying-reach-uk-arrested-calais-328184 for a ukipper 1 illegal immigrant is too many apparently , 
   watch an elite worker resigning , that elite worker was refused hiring because the big boss at the time said that he is n't a team player . 
  sadly the big boss was old and had to bow down . 
  fuck it . 
  if turkey is planning this : please mohammed/mehmet and allah . 
  ah so you ' r a blind nationalist . 
  so much better / s, 
  brexit is the gift that keeps on giving . 
  dude , go vote akp and leave us normal people alone . 
  go bitch that women should have kids and get married and wear a veil . 
  neah . 
  it 's very pleasant to walk on it as is , 
  can/aus/nz and the usa will be using all of their soft power to ensure the uk gets a fair shake . 
  yeah that doens ' t mean much . 
  in terms of soft power eu can manage very well ( see when the us wanted ukraine and georgia to join nato and germany said : yeah no ) . 
  the deals will be fair but reciprocal . 
  uk wants to block the circulation of eu citizens . 
  well then eu will block the circulation or british citizens . 
  uk imposes residence permits on eu citizens , eu will impose residence permits on uk citizens, 
  uk is not canada . 
  canada has ** 10 ** times more trade with the us than with the eu . 
  if the us are doing fine , canada will do fine by proxy . 
  comparing the two just through the lense * oh their currency took a dive * makes no sense whatsoever . 
  my croissants are soggy today . 
  thanks deutschland !,
