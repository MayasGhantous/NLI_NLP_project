  you 're not from europe , are you ? 
  or like under 15 . 
  the british and french empire are tired of the colonial game . 
  now we 'll play the democracy , freedom of the people game . 
  tag you 're it us . 
   degree in woman 's studies or basket weaving yes . 
  i hear they give millions of such degrees in uk universities . 
  i never needed an eu flag so badly :d, 
   what 's to stop the influx of eu migrants in the next 2 years ? 
  could be hordes ... well since you 're not longer part of the dublin agreements france might decide it feels no obligation to stop the migrants at calais . 
  that wo n't happen . 
  [ well macron said it might ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/03/03/macron-previent-les-anglais-qu-en-cas-de-brexit-la-france-ne-retiendrait-plus-les-migrants-a-calais_4875561_3214.html ), 
  but dude ... you were really happy a few hours ago . 
  singing the death of the eu . 
  what happened ? 
   if they want to let people in from germany they 're more than welcome to , if they do n't , well they do n't . 
  well uk better like getting its pensioners back from the eu then  it 's called negociation . 
  and not it 's 26 vs 1 . 
  itt : people that do n't understand the word `` independence '' . 
   `` educated '' just means you got a piece of paper , does n't mean you 're really that intelligent , or even smart yeah that 's why i like my surgeon to be a man of the people . 
  have a brewski with me . 
  connect . 
  degrees ? 
  they do n't matter . 
  i want a guy with street smart to cut me open , not a book worm . 
  well it is now . 
  bye bye britain . 
  as the english will descend into nice in two days ... 
  i better prepare myself for these foreigners . 
  i will be gracious enough to welcome them on european union soil and hope they wo n't have visa problems . 
  de gaulle called it 50 years ago . 
  we should have a drink on the anniversary . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/27/newsid_4187000/4187714.stm 27th of november 2017 . 
  62 % remain is ** huuuge ** . 
  it 's way more than what france would do in a frexit . 
  you can not expect 80 % scores in these tense situations but the trend is clearly there . 
  england took scotland out of europe . 
  the americans are coming !, 
  uhm you know that uk doesnt have a football team right ? 
  it 's more scotland and ni got a horrible thrashing . 
  this [ map ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results ) says it all . 
  a country divided . 
   what the hell has uk done . 
  so much salt , dirt , and scum . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results scotland 61 % remain , liverpool 58 % remain . 
  it 's nearly finished man, 
  dude ... bush . 
  nuff said . 
  thing is trump simply has no political program . 
  he can say whatever and if the twitter sphere will complain he 'll just backpedal . 
  wtf ? 
  dude . 
  this all fun and games . 
  but do n't you guys fucking dare vote trump . 
  really . 
  you ca n't do that to the world . 
  italy , our brother from another more gorgeous mother . 
  we 're in this together . 
  yeah but unlike the uk , [ we 're too tied with germany  ] ( https://static.iter.org/all/newsline_1_120/img/106/11_nov.jpg._1024.jpg ), 
   beginning of the end for the eu . 
  nope . 
  we still need to build airbuses , make renaults and volkswagens , siemens still needs to produce trains and whatever . 
  arianes to be launched . 
  the eu is too dear at heart to the french and germans . 
  we might be grumpy but we know what 's what . 
  45 % of french want to stay in the eu . 
  33 % want out . 
  we 're staying buddy . 
   this is undermining a 50 year old work . 
  uhm ... you do know de gaulle called it 50 years ago when uk was knocking at our door and he said no . 
  as soon as the old bastard was out of the picture , europe got its dream . 
  fish and chips ? 
  at this hour ? 
  ok nevermind ... do n't worry you 'll survive , you 'll be able to visit europe whenever you want , study wherever you want basically . 
  europe will be just as open to the brits as alway cuz we know you 're good people . 
  your crappy people do n't tend to visit a lot ( unless you count the hooligans ) . 
  and yeah ... the americans are way more responsible than the brits . 
  americans vote obama , brits vote for fptp that gives them cameron . 
  honestly i think they 're better off and europe will be better off . 
  really . 
  no sarcasm implied here . 
  i hope france does n't fuck up as badly in any area so as to get congratulated by people like that . 
  then i am happy and i 'm sure you 're happy democracy is respected , 
   scotland had their chance to jump ship , they might want to do it again . 
  they expressed such a desire . 
  it 's not very democratic to deny them that right . 
  you can always move to scotland :p, 
  better start a line to get residence permit . 
  administration in spain is super efficient right ? 
  cuz in france it is . 
  you only need 7 random documents and wait 5 hours in a huge line ... 
  yeah . 
  well the scotish people voted differently than the english people . 
  like you said ... * people * . 
  a few weeks lufthansa was in a strike . 
  the strikes have nothing to do with the economy but with labor laws that are trying to be passed . 
  not exactly since the french are quite okay and happy with the british leaving . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/03/12/une-majorite-de-francais-souhaite-un-referendum-sur-le-frexit-la-sortie-de-la-france-de-l-ue_4881768_3214.html 44 % want them to leave . 
  so there you have it  the eu ** must ** respect the wish of the british people !, 
  is it very important to us .
