  that 's why a socialist minister could make such a statement and face no political consequences . 
   as much as the result may dismay you , this is proof of democracy working . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results look at that map . 
  the head is yellow the body is blue . 
  is that really democracy ? 
   congratulations to ~ ~ britain ~ ~ england and wales . 
  hope scotland will wake up . 
  60-40 for remain . 
  facts = things you know . 
  since you 're making statements about the future , it is not a fact . 
   english . 
  your language . 
  learn it and do n't get salty . 
  i fucking hope so . 
  this would make me switch position immediatly . 
   however , if this shocks the shit out of europe , and real change can be made now , i 'll be happy to stay . 
  hell no . 
  out is out , in is in . 
  the result is clear . 
  you heard it from schauble , macron and juncker .

   wants independence from ~ ~ britain ~ ~ england . 
  england wants independence from eu .

  lowest point its been since 1986 .  not bad . 
  not bad at all, 
  yup that 's better than what a french referendum would say on a frexit  ), 
  :d oh the salt . 
  better buy those tickets for scotland soon . 
  i hope easyjet will be understanding and lower prices . 
   except greece has n't been helped , look at argentina that defaulted and 14 years on still does n't have access to the market . 
    the eu as an institution is flawed and the sooner it 's scrapped the sooner a true federalization can replace it . 
  it is happening . 
  the eurozone !, 
   why do europeans find it so difficult to find that us british are different ? 
  we do n't . 
  de gaulle refused uk * twice * entering in the common market because he said you guys are insular and you wan na do your own thing . 
  we get you . 
  we understand you better than you do . 
  i just hope these 40 years were not got nothing . 
  this was n't a brexit but an enxit . 
  scotland wants europe , and scotland deserved europe . 
   britannia rule the waves !, 
  be careful !, 
  the waves are [ high and they 're crashing down hard ] ( https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/free-live-charting-service-pound-sterling-live ) . 
   forces countries to ruin themselves ? 
  where is proof ? 
  there no is proof !, 
  time to visit scotland !, 
  :d hourrah . 
  de gaulle called it about 49 years ago . 
   this is the beginning of the end for the eu . 
  the eu did n't start nor will it end with ** england ** or wales . 
  airbuses have to be made , arianes have to be launched in space , greece has to be helped . 
  we 'll survive because the will is there , 
  40 years this will affect us . 
  this aint over , 
   how terrible !, 
  now your wifes , mothers and daughters wo n't get to feel all the joys of migrant crisis !, 
  will they get russian tourists and green men , pavel ? 
  free england you mean . 
  look at the map . 
   well you 'll have wales :d, 
  we 're grade a cunts , 
  eu = france + germany + any other country that wants this shit  airbuses wont built themselves . 
  you 're probably too young to remember 9/11 . 
  this will impact us all for the next 40 years . 
  uk might break up . 
  fun times . 
  how low can it go ? 
   why ca n't you just admit that it 's their sexy sheep that you want ? 
  we 'll have scotland for that . 
  scotland is ours .

   why do you even want to stay in `` union '' that forces countries to ruin themselves ? 
  you being russian i 'm sure you felt the need to replace union with ukraine . 
  okay this is funny . 
  but the stump is actually terrifying . 
  i do wan na watch the world burn in a brexit way . 
  i do n't want a tump prez . 
  i hope americans will be responsible . 
  guys ... remember to stop a little . 
  go outside . 
  look at the dark sky . 
  in some decades kids will ask you where were you when brexit happened . 
  this is probably the most important moment we had since 9/11 . 
   i wonder what happens to us now : / according to farange , no liverpoolian football player will ever slip again . 
  hey germany . 
  since it 's now you and us in the eu now running the show , how about we buy england and wales ? 
  the pound is super low , we can get a good offer . 
  we 'll give you london since you always had a thing for it . 
  but we get wales ... for bale reasons . 
  you sly dawg ... you want a european war . 
  and the pound is ... getting a pounding . 
  hey scots up for an independence ? 
  you know you guys and us have a thing . 
  ya know ... 
   ( ignore my flair ) why ?
