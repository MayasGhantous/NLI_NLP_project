  so neah , we do n't wan na leave . 
   additional powers within the eu ? 
  yes . 
  the power of invisibility , the power of leaping really high , maybe the spidey sense ... maybe ...

  2014 brazil-germany 1-7, 
   this idea sends shivers down my spine . 
  but i bet you 're happy it 's not sending blood down your arteries . 
  ca n't you see how much / u/shitfacephil cares about rape and sexual assault ? 
  he simply refuses to use it as a `` gotcha '' argument . 
   only uberx no . 
  uberpop . 
  thanks for the good humour man . 
  i chuckled . 
   i lived in nice . 
  it may be different in paris , i do n't really know , but nice is a big city . 
  well it 's your lucky day   everybody uses cheques , have you ever been to a doctor ? 
  you want me to give you a list of doctors that accept payment by card terminal ? 
  because i can  especially since nowadays the terminals that read the carte vitale also read plastic payment cards . 
  did you have a carte vitale ? 
  http://www.distrimed.com/teletrans/lecteursv.php  have you registered a car ? 
  yeah the deposit . 
  you 'd rather have the car company remove money from your account than give a check that wont be cashed unless you damage the car ? 
  really man ? 
   not to mention elderly people paying by cheque in a supermarket blocking the queue for half an hour . 
  so your beef is with elderly people ? 
  sheesh , you sound like a fun person . 
   from the lack of websites where you could rate doctors or lawyers yeah such a thing would actually be illegal in france . 
  how many european countries have that huh ? 
   slow internet ( looking like taken straight from 2005 ) to extremely low quality of service finally an argument that is valid . 
  italian net is slower but yeah we could do better . 
  in the end your beef with cheques is simply you being ridiculous . 
  cheques allow not having to move money out of your account and to move it back in . 
  it is simply more convenient . 
  and concerning card usage https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2014/html/pr140429.en.html france uses it at three times the rate of germans or polish . 
  5 times more often than italians and twice more often than spanish or austrians . 
  so ... you were saying ? 
  i ca n't recall any major software company from london but you can refresh my memory . 
  dude ... you 're embarrassing yourself . 
  from all your experience from ** living ** in france , what you took was using cheques ( no one uses them in day to day operations ) and booking a cinema seat ? 
  c'mon dude ... you did n't live in france . 
  stop lying . 
  yeah . 
  france can not duplicate silicon valley while the rest of europe is doing an amazing job at it ... 
  well do n't bother praying to god because apparently he hates amputees . 
  not cancer victims though . 
  seconded . 
  yes after the great economic boom of 2002-2006 . 
  do you expect any other type of boom ? 
  your median salary is extremely low , to the level of romania and look how romania joining the eu caused massive immigration . 
  about 2 million have left in the period . 
  turkey being some 3.5 times larger , that would mean about 7 millions turks . 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  when you 'll reach the level of development of italy we 'll talk . 
  because it basically did n't need it . 
  unlike the catholic church which was very well organised and centralised , the orthodox did n't have a central ruler . 
  very early on churched separated and basically every time the patriarch in each country was subjected to the ruler of the country and not the other way round as in the catholic church . 
  the lack of important of the orthodox church in political matters is again attested by the lack of religious wars in the east, 
   there were countries with worse gdp per capita at the time of joining . 
  but not 75 million people . 
   even without most of these ( like the time turkey first applied ) it was impossible for turkey to join . 
  let 's admit it . 
  if turkey reaches the levels of development italy , spain or portugal enjoy , we 'll talk about it , but now you have the median salary of romania . 
  and there are ** 75 ** million . 
  i do n't know about your country , but asians in france make an honest effort to belong . 
  they name their kids with french names etc. 
  how is the marvel tower ? 
  junker was smart . 
  if uk stays they know they wo n't get anything more . 
  and looking at the polls , 1 % lead is nothing with 11 % undecided and such a major issue at stake . 
  britain will stay . 
  hue, 
   we never got a vote on being ran by brussels . 
  yes you did in 1975 common market referendum . 
   fuck the eu do n't worry . 
  there will be no brexit . 
  the leave would have needed a significant lead in the polls coming into this , which they do n't have ... 
   it 's not like i would rob you no but i value muh virginitah . 
  but if you so desire you can claim a cultural trinket if you win . 
   france 's hos is also elected and has executive powers . 
  senate is not government . 
   cultural items yeah ... 
  i 'm all for giving my address to random people on the internet   i have never guilded someone so this would be a first deal . 
  i 'll guild you if brexit and vice versa is they remain . 
  corrected my comment . 
  fine . 
  no need to wait . 
  the polls are even . 
  in a major decision like this , it means the status quo wins . 
  governments are never elected . 
  do you people even democracy ? 
   uk left . 
  uk wont leave . 
  particles would only affect at most a generation if we ban tomorrow diesel . 
  co2 wouldnt be fixed in a generation ... 
  yeah i 'm sure people living in th\u00e9 eu have a super shitty life . 
  dude , do n't get so testy you start [ a new balkan war . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_balkan_war ), 
  compared to what austro-hungary did , it was minimal ... 
  winners get the prize , what are you going to do ?
