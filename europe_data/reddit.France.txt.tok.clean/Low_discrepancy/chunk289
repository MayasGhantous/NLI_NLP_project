  the french and german simply said it like it is : you 're in or you 're out . 
  no more negociations . 
  take it or leave it . 
  they did n't get removed from their positions ... maybe signalling that their people kinda do agree on that position . 
  nobody ( except the eurosceptic ) want uk out . 
  but a lot of people are getting tired with the whole negociating with uk . 
  the brits are fine . 
  but those brexiters and those eurosceptics that want special treatment for everything , that maggie that kept asking for her money back , it 's completely understandable that french and german politicians have had enough of it . 
  the people certainty did . 
   french and german leaders have issued threats against an independent britain , making the eu seem ( minorly ) tyranical . 
  maybe because french and germans had to deal with the brits for longer than 2004 , 
  so you mean to say you were comparing apples with peaches and concluded that apples do n't taste like peaches ? 
  / r/pitchforkemporium let 's use the -- | -- | - lorraine cross pitchfork . 
  those heathens will ** obey or die **, 
  tarantino made that cover . 
   behind the three sects they 're not sects . 
   it 's not that weird to think that the roman catholics might find a bit of unity with the orthodox churches . 
  trust me ... wo n't happen . 
  baptism is the minimal thing . 
  you have to remember how different the treatment is regarding saints for example , or virgin mary . 
  the theological differences between catholics and orthodox are minimal but they 're still lightyears away . 
   christian orthodox churches closer to the other christian churches catholic , protestant etc. 
  after they 'll bridge the differences between the sunnis and shia and they 'll fix the middle east . 
  in the end , they 'll unite all 3 abrahamic religions ... right ? 
   hungarian and it tilts me so fucking hard every time because you nearly had your first win in a major football competition ? 
  click bait title is click bait . 
  called salade russe in french . 
   symbian is n't it ? 
  i think i was two redheads using it ... 
   all of your pain au chocolate . 
  oka then . 
  cheers . 
  keep your army we wo n't have your bullshit . 
  build your nato schengen with canada . 
   thepeople yeah the people . 
  unless you 're not aware , armies serve the interests of countries they come from . 
  in this case the us army , no matter what , will serve the interests of the us govt and its people . 
  the do n't serve the interests of the germans , polish or french . 
  this was absolutely obvious in the case of the nsa spying . 
  the us army serves the interests of the us and undoubtedly the french army would carry out the same type of espionage of allies if it would have the same capabilities . 
  and that 's alright . 
  but you 're not spying on us or on the germans for our sake or for the sake of the germans . 
  if some sort of agreement were passed were the armies would pass under the full and total control of the head of state of the country they 're going through , then i 'd agree . 
  ( as in american groups would be under the control of the german chancellor while in germany , meaning they do n't have the us president as supreme commander ) . 
  but until then , no no no . 
  i do not want france to become like poland or romania where you put your own cia torture prisons or passed through convicts ( some completely innocent ) to guantanamo . 
  and your other examples : all strawmen . 
  a plane can easily go through if it gets clearance since if it turns rogue it can be easily shot down . 
  the parliament does not need to be notified . 
  this is about battalions , heavy stuff . 
  and efficiency is achieved in case of a war when the president takes full command of the country . 
  you do n't need efficiency in time of peace , it 's just a scheme by army people to get more and more control . 
  no thank you . 
  pass . 
  dude . 
  go seek psychiatric help !, 
  now !, 
  i 'd count it more as political assassination than terrorism . 
  ( which in my book is more dangerous ) . 
   drinking is never allowed . 
   a couple of days and this kind of things kinda scare me . 
  of what ? 
  what are the odds of actually being physically hurt in a terrorist attack ? 
  while very rare , it might happened 3 times per year for a policeman/police woman to be killed while in service http://mobile.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/06/14/une-dizaine-de-policiers-tues-en-service-ou-en-mission-chaque-annee_4950476_4355770.html edit : it 's not always clear what the cause of death is though . 
   i 've never met someone who has been circumcised and is somehow unhappy about it . 
  that 's a stupid argument . 
  those children have to grow up with that penis . 
  and that penis is theirs now . 
  they have n't had any other penis so of course they 're ok with it . 
  i have met about 0 people over 18 that wanted to get a circumcision . 
  see . 
  the argument goes both ways . 
   are you implying that those unions have a greater interest in the internal politics of a nation than defensive groups ? 
  i am implying that having a bunch of foreign people on your soil is less of a risk to the sovereignty of the state than an army . 
  go look up any european constitution and the 2nd or 3rd word is * sovereign * nation . 
  my rights have to be respect . 
  the interests of the us army is to advance and project the interests of the us govt and us people . 
  not those of the country being traversed . 
  ( the us being an example here . 
  swap it with any other country ) . 
  if any army wants to enter french soil , they have to ask the french parliament because it is * our * right as a sovereign people . 
   it 's not like the us would go out and conquer poland if they decided they did n't want to be part of the zone . 
  again * no * . 
  it 's the principle of it . 
  a foreign army when entering a country has to demand * the people * for permission . 
  we 're running in circles if you refuse to understand the most basic rights of sovereign people because `` the us wo n't friggin invade '' . 
   explain how sarco stabilizing the economie quite well debt that went from 66 % of the gdp to 90 % of the gdp . 
  600 ** b ** million euros . 
  he fucking spent like a mad man to make suckers think he managed it well and left hollander with a hot potato . 
   flamby walks the fuck in and tears everything down , makes him worse there is no help for you . 
  obviously economics degrees are n't worth jack in this country . 
   it would be too slow to make a difference in a hypothetical conflict . 
  if a real conflict happenes then the president declares a state of war and obtains significant powers so as to hasten the defence of the country . 
  since that is not the case , then normal procedures have to be followed . 
   the risks seem minimal . 
  they might or might be not . 
  but the real question here is : * should a people , through their democratically elected representatives decide what happens on their soil ? 
  * the answer should be resounding ** yes ** . 
  i will always vote so that the parliament has full powers in such * fundamental * issues and not some far away generals . 
  this is n't a bunch of migrants or foreign workers .
