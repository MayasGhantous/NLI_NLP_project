  you ** avoid ** all the heavy issues . 
   san bernandino happened a couple of month ago , to see the americans criticize belgium now , well , that 's quite ironic . 
  that 's such a silly idea to have . 
  just because something happened to you , does n't mean you can not push others and yourself to do better . 
  the most wanted men in belgium walked in an airport with aks and bags full of explosives and blew themselves up . 
  wtf ? 
  one shot at the police with an ak in 2009 . 
  he was arrested . 
  released in 2015 , found later by the turkish police close to the syrian border , was sent back and the belgian police just went * shrug * . 
  dude . 
   do n't do anything . 
  do n't change anything . 
  that 's kinda the attitude i got from belgian people i 've met on here . 
  `` we were all expecting it . 
  could n't have been avoided . '', 
  carry on , nothing to see here . 
  normally you need to show id when you buy a sim card . 
  did i read the wrong article ? 
  politician ** s ** --  talks about 1 * american * politician i never heard about before this ( and also a lot about hitler but i skimmed through that part ) . 
  i come to / r/europe to find out about obscure european politicians not obscure american ones . 
  but how were they caught ? 
  they used different voices and shook they faces, 
  well you follow the laws . 
  if the laws bother you , you do n't start breaking them . 
  not just the media . 
  his lawyer came out saying abdeslam is fully cooperating , he knows a lot of stuff , he is renouncing his right to remain silent . 
  he is invaluable to the investigation . 
  good guy sven . 
   yep , thats it . 
  good guy belgium , taking care of every citizen , even their lost sons . 
  setting the bar high on humane treatment . 
  just think about it man , if you were a terrorist , would you not want to be treated like that ? 
  always remember , you too can become a terrorist some day . 
  abdeslam probably hard a harsher life when he was on the run . 
   in france too we have hate laws , pretty much similar to those in britain and many other western european countries . 
  having a debate on free speech and hate laws is as interesting as stale bread . 
  there are a ton of arguments for and against . 
  but some comments :  the guys who elaborated these laws in the 90s think they 're all righteous and all , but they 're insane laws , and should be removed immediately . 
  these types of laws exist since the 1880s  i want to insult islam as a religion/ideology , just like i may insult christianity , without fearing prosecution for speech crimes . 
  huh ? 
  have n't you heard of ch ? 
  you are free to do those things . 
   look at breivik for example . 
  breivik sadly got media attention . 
  the media should have been banned from his trial . 
  why would i downvote that ? 
  yeah that link will stay blue : /, 
  not to mention is was in the non nuclear part . 
  they arrest people in the uk for the weirdest shit . 
  yeah he was being a dick like the dude with airport tweet a few years ago , but arresting ? 
  had a chat with a serbian . 
  let 's just say they have mixed feelings about srebenica . 
  yes it was awful , but at least they only killed military aged men ... 
  out of the 10 , two were refugees . 
  convicted 80 yo terrirs ? 
  for 1 million a pop i 'm sure some countries will accept . 
   trouble has been brewing for a while . 
  neah . 
  politicians are playing the : `` there was nothing we could do '' card . 
  why would we want that ? 
  russia has the nasty habit of being in auto-destruct mode . 
   muslims from north africa ( e.g. 
  algerians ) [ ... ] as well as muslims from further north ( e.g. 
  nigerian muslims ) what man ? 
  are you using one of those weird upside down aussie map ? 
  wow . 
  my brain just went in meltdown ( it did n't help that a serbian friend tried to explain the concept on nationality v citizenship in the yugoslavian region ) . 
  the level of complications here . 
  my god . 
   all the screaming i doubt you heard any screaming   you 're unhinged . 
  i give up . 
  ;-) finally . 
  i was at work so i could n't check in detail the udhr.omg no way someone can actually believe it 's legally binding . 
  look at this :  everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . 
  omg . 
  :d  everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . 
  wow this is a killer . 
  in france if you work in companies smaller than 20 people , you can be refused to create a union . 
  zomg someone call the police :d  everyone , without any discrimination , has the right to equal pay for equal work . 
   ) ) so all the world is illegal under this one . 
  women vs men pay inequality . 
  wow who would believe this is legally binding  everyone who works has the right to just and ** favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity ** , and supplemented , if necessary , by other means of social protection . 
  did you ever eat at a restaurant that has servers in the us ? 
  yeah they 're breaking the udhr . 
  if you 're underpaid , tell your boss he 's breaking the udhr . 
  omg man . 
  i did n't realise it . 
   ) ) # just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity according to you that 's a law . 
  dude i am honestly laughing . 
  :d you 're the lawyer huh ? 
  do you have other legal terms for me . 
  jus courgette ? 
  i must say i admire your conviction in this matter though . 
  no sarcasm here . 
  have a nice one :d at least i got a good laugh man , thanks . 
  never went through my mind to read the udhr . 
   # just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity this i will quote more often . 
  shit i already imagine those people writing and signing this thinking ... yeah not gon na happen . 
  :d . cuba signed it . 
  they were taking the piss .
