  this is an important part of a country . 
  it 's defence . 
   and the organization itself never overturned a democratic referendum . 
  what kind of logic is that ? 
  nato is n't a political organisation . 
  so of course they 're not involved in the political process . 
   having to have parliaments recalled before a country is eligible to cross another 's border in a defensive organization like nato is kind of ridiculous if you think about it . 
  yeah . 
  why let the democratically elected representatives of a sovereign people decide what happens on their soil . 
  it 's much better to leave that decision process to some general in belgium or netherlands or wherever that is . 
  / u/verylateish got you there ... 
   scotland does n't have their own currency new currency pegged on the pound . 
  big deal . 
   and they 'd not qualify to join the euro due to their large budget deficit , luckly eu is n't the euro zone then  . 
  you know that right ? 
  they can say they 'll join the eurozone some time in the undetermined future . 
  no one cares . 
  who knows when poland will join the eurozone for example ... never ? 
   with largest military in europe ? 
  so you 'll take your army and go home ? 
  or something ? 
   is the eu going to want scotland to stay as a continuing state when it could have it rejoin on equal terms to everyone else ? 
  can you tell me one admission factor where romania or bulgaria beat scotland ? 
  while i do n't think it 's feasible to talk about scotland in the eu before it separates from uk , i do believe that scotland has every right to be in the eu if it so desires since it 's much more developed than countries we already have in ... plus i 'm sure france will agree with such a situation . 
   marseille ... prettiest well that 's a phrase i never thought id hear in my lifetime . 
  i 'm guessing you 're from marseille , right ? 
  because no child would admit their mom is ugly af . 
  well i prefer reading the guardian or bbc if i 'm checking news about the uk . 
  master race , baby ... where are my spoils of beautiful british women ^ 1 ready to pamper me ? 
  1 : before you judge the beauty of british women just remember elizabeth hurley and zeta jones are brits . 
   brexit supporters are principally aiming to dethrone the `` establishment '' , whether it is left or right . 
  are 18-29 , guardian readers , snp voters really the establishment ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  they came through turkey did they not ? 
  so why complain ? 
   to the country with not a great record on dealing with people respectfully or human rights . 
  i 'm sure they prefer turkey to syria . 
  just like people think putin is russia or merkel is becoming germany . 
  you ca n't be ruled by the same guy for 15 odd years and say : neah no connection . 
  i felt sad tunisia had tourism problems because either was caused by some idiot terrorists . 
  but turkey ... 
   your old office appliances i used to own my old office appliances . 
  i do n't own people . 
  and syrian citizens never were eu citizens . 
  ** words have meanings ** . 
  we have maybe 2 million here in a population of 500 million people that is hardly seriously affecting our societies and how much money will it cost ? 
  it 's fun to throw numbers around but let 's face it , the economically strong countries also are n't really big . 
  sweden already buckled . 
  germany too . 
  there 's no shame in admitting limits . 
  as soon as the war ends i 'm sure europe will be keen to help syria rebuild . 
   literally trading humans . 
  uhm . 
  human trade involves profit being made . 
  what profit is the eu getting from the syrians ? 
   embarrassing mistake trump ? 
  yes !, 
   why do you want us to leave the uk ? 
  because you 're our brother from another mother . 
  witness me !, 
   and improve people 's lives . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  nato does n't improve anyone 's lives . 
  and they were because of the eu ... yeaaaah . 
  impressive ... 
  is that for real ? 
   `` these laws '' is not this law though . 
  i 'm not that convinced the parliamentarians thought it through . 
  then someone will complain to the european court of human rights . 
  just like it happened in the case of france . 
  and if everything is ok , then the law will pas , just as it happened in the case of france . 
   tit denied nope , you 're still here , man . 
  i 've got on me a half empty pack of paper handkerchiefs , some post-its that do n't really stick at all , a pencil sharper ( i need the pencil so i 'm keeping that ) and ... after checking some belly button lint . 
  that 's the best i can do right now , take it or leave it . 
   clear majority of people in the czech republic would vote to leave eu according to opinion polls so if / once brexit will had happened we may be the next . 
  we can only hope that you will vote on this issue . 
  we need a federal europe and that can not be achieved with small countries that just think locally and big countries that wan na go out there on the global scene . 
   there 's also the issue of falling wages for the working class ( although falling wages have happened to the median worker as well and that is due to the recession more than immigration ) . 
  yes boris ca n't wait to get uk out of the eu so he can raise the wages of workers ... 
  if you spend your time in city centers in alsace ... surprise surprise not a ton . 
  come to alpes maritimes where we have 1.5 % of the total population of continential france but we send 10 % of jihadists . 
  the san bernadino shooting ? 
  yes very unfortunate . 
   that 's good had you bothered to check the actual issue , you 'd have realised that that 's what the face covering laws mean . 
  they cover anything from helmets to ski masks to whatever you want , unless the reason is protection . 
  such as during a bike ride . 
  these laws simply state that you will get detained if you refuse to show your face when the police asks you . 
  before you could walk merrily down the street with your helmet on . 
  after if a police sees you , he can ask you to remove it . 
  this law does n't mean you as a citizen can rip off people 's helmets if you see them in the street . 
  i 've seen multiple women wearing full face covering veils in france and i did n't tackle them to remove their clothing . 
   so , no helmets while riding motorcycles ? 
  got people be illogical on this thread . 
  this type of law means you have to remove your helmet/ski mask/whatevs if you enter public buildings . 
  it means that the police can come up to you and ask you to show your face and if you refuse , they can detain you . 
  it does n't mean you , random citizen can go and rip helmets off of people 's heads ** because you 're not a law enforcer ** . 
   there is simply no problem with people wearing niqaab . 
  yeah . 
  but the us and canada do n't have fringe extremist muslims ... 
  i think ...
