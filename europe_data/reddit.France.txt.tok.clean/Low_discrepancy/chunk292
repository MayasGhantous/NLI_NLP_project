  religion is a private matter , it does not intervene in the republic 's institutions . 
  the republic does not recognise any religion and as such can not offer any break or any rooms for students with religious beliefs . 
  it 's like making a special room of ghosts . 
  or imaginary pink dinosaurs . 
  it 's a matter of principle . 
  no one suffers because you can do your prayers at home . 
   ( and at least to me the choice of your religion is not really that much different than the choice of being a vegetarian ) of course they are different . 
  usually people are vegetarians because they have a strong empathic tie with animals . 
  or they believe raising animals for consumption consumes too much energy . 
  a vast array of reasons that have logic behind them . 
  religion ... well people are religious because their parents were . 
  that 's what happens in 90 % of cases , especially regarding organised religion . 
  being accomodating to religion is like being accomodating to people who dislike any food that is red . 
  it has no logical , scientific basis and you think ... why ? 
  it 's marked as a triple alliance country ... 
   than the little effort it takes to organize it ? 
  again ... secular state . 
  i mean i do n't expect you to understand , being german and all . 
  but in a normal secular state , there is a strict separation between religion and state organisations . 
  it 's okay luv . 
  we 'll just screen the baby before its born to see if its a downer . 
   how about the mass murder of orthodox clergy in the great purge ? 
  yeah that 's not th\u00e9 holodomor . 
  you want pupils to pray during the break . 
  that means they need a reserved space -  prayer room . 
  that goes against secularism . 
  do you think holodomor affected only jewish ? 
  and it 's most likely due to soviet incompetence and has ** nothing ** to due with ussr 's stance on religion . 
   no harm comes if some students pray in 5 minutes between classes . 
  again , is it a secular society or not ? 
  i do n't know about denmark ( if it 's like germany then no ) . 
  but if you 're a secular society then you do n't carry out religious activities in school . 
  it 's the definition of the thing ya know ... 
  oh shit man . 
  i was on the fence about what you were saying but that high quality very precise and factual cartoon convinced me you are right . 
  far right . 
  that empty class needs to be reserved etc etc. 
  a school in a secular society does not know religion therefore it does not know prayer rooms . 
  they do not exist . 
   that 's why atheist regimes never incite mass starvation or deport millions of jews to an oblast in bum fuck nowhere . 
  what do you learn in history classes buddy ? 
  schools should n't provide prayer rooms . 
  tax money should n't go to building religious institutions . 
   as we already get more than enough salt . 
  we can see that . 
  so the poor russian fans had to bash that brit into a comma and had to charge at the marseille stadium . 
  god man we 're so sorry : s how dare that brit have a face that could get smashed in ... 
  we 'll wait when poland plays russia . 
  how did it go in 2012 ? 
  i heard you were having parties together . 
   no reason for you to be bias ? 
  t well there 's the brit that 's in a coma because the ruskies decided to come out and play with metal pipes ... so there 's that . 
  also the stadium charge that the russians did ... nope sorry ... russians are the worst . 
  did you check the link ? 
  she does n't look full on white ... just saying . 
  the dutch consulate will pay , so it seems after reading bbc, 
   better bread how do you take you bread ? 
  salty ? 
  did these journalists ever hear of 2005 ' ? 
  yeah . 
  imagine in summer having to wear a suit when women can wear nice summer dresses at work . 
  screw that . 
   clearly the policy has proved non viable in its current state . 
  clearly ? 
  how is that clearly when eu immigrants ask for fewer benefits than your own locals ? 
   well , no , if there is an unanimous vote by the remaining eu members that period can be extended . 
  and here i was thinking that the 2 year period was a law imposed by the universe . 
  i wonder what sanctions have been imposed . 
  i think there was the removal from erasmus . 
  as 2017 approaches it 's gon na be fun . 
  i like drama . 
   all i was saying is , israel is not a model to emulate elsewhere . 
  in terms of airport security ... sorry it is . 
   very particular problems fair enough but you can not say it never works . 
   that the netherlands do n't share does belgium share a similar problem ? 
  with some 500 + isis fighters that will come home ? 
   as is the human rights situation . 
  ah yes , because in the west we 're stellar in terms of human rights . 
  hr are a nebulous concept . 
  when a country sees it useful to break hrs , it does so willingly . 
  and many would agree that the japanese fire bombing was necessary etc etc. 
  winners make the history books ... not the losers . 
  and france lost ww2, 
  they should have asked for prima noctis rights . 
  many believe that racial profiling is ** always ** bad . 
  and that 's simply not the case . 
  it is simply the opinion of clemenceau at the time . 
  a new war would follow because the versailles did not go far enough . 
  when germany starts the rearmament so quickly , builds up anew army under the sa , you can not argue that the entente bothered to check if versailles was properly applied or sufficient . 
   okay , so isis will just use indonesian jihadists instead and completely pass your system read my previous comment to see why what your said is naive . 
   there are plenty of other isis members they can send if europe starts to racially profile arabs well let 's take two examples ( and an extra one ) * during the paris attacks there were 2 unidentified irakis ... very successful ... the below themselves up without any casualties ... retards ** because ** they did n't know the area , they did n't know french . 
  * remember the german attack that was foiled ?

  you know how they were caught ? 
  a syrian was sent in france , he did n't know shit about the country , panicked and turned himself in . 
  * you know how the bruxelles jewish museum shooter ( killed 4 ) was caught ? 
  his identity was ** unknown ** at the time . 
  he was caught in ** marseille ** by border police while he was in a bus because he was acting suspiciously , a bit nervous , and was avoiding eye contact . 
  they controlled his bags , found aks and connected the dots . 
  your  not too long ago a japanese guy tried to join isis but was caught in turkey .
