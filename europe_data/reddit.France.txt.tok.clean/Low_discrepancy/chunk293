  is a dream . 
  you watched too much james bond/bourne movies . 
  terrorists are n't all knowing beings . 
  a terrorist attack , to be successful , needs a ton of preparation ( ** information ** , safe houses , people on the ground with supplies , training , how to avoid police , etc ) . 
  it 's not friggin amateur hour here . 
  you do n't go on google and plan it . 
  you do n't check google maps and call it a day . 
  it takes a ton of know-how ( for example the now infamous omar mateen , how did he block so many people ? 
  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/12/omar-mateen-id-d-as-orlando-killer.html he was a security agent ) it 's time that you return to reality and understand the complexities of a terrorist attack . 
  it 's not a point and shoot . 
  you do n't bring in a japanese and an indonesia and call it a day . 
  it simply does n't work like that , unless you want them to blow up themselves in an alley like it happened already . 
  edit : formatting, 
  again it is not a preventive measure . 
  it is simply that in certain situations where speed of processing and thoroughness are important . 
  if you let one baddy go through an airport , 250 people die . 
  that 's ** five ** gay clubs shootings , that 's ** two ** paris terrorist attacks . 
  it makes fucking sense to include race as one of the flags ( it 's importance , etc should be determined ) that should be raised . 
  the israelis do n't take the : arab ? 
  okay guys lock him up route because that ** is retarded ** . 
  but race is a factor . 
  did you have a point ? 
   islam is n't confined to arab/berbers . 
  the ones committing terrorist attacks in europe and israel seem to be in that group . 
  sorry but that 's a fact . 
   i thought this was about crime but your racialism racial profiling implies racialism  i hope that 's not a breakthrough for you . 
   and a normal dutchman would n't be suspicious if he had been to syria for unknown reasons ? 
  it raises a flag . 
  a colleague of mine was stopped for interrogation while at the israeli airport . 
  he 's a blue eyed french man with the most french name you 've ever heard but he had in his passport a stamp from tunisia . 
  he was asked questions to prove that his reasons for travel were honest . 
  well you use a ridiculous statement . 
  it is not a debate it is shit slinging . 
  let us debate israel . 
  not some fantasy example you create in your own mind . 
  yes i 'm sure the israelis really suck at their job and you 'd do a much much better job . 
   if i lived in the netherlands , i would move instantly if i started to get stopped by the police much more often because i look darker . 
  if your ethnicity is arab/berber , if your passport shows that you 've been into syria and if you 're a someone between the ages of 17-40 then you should be checked . 
  if you 're a dark skinned mapouche from chile that is 60 yo then you should pass through the system faster . 
  well then you are an ideologue and we have nothing to discuss . 
  you are not here to debate you are here to list your own ideologies ( regardless of how empirically valid they are ) . 
  that 's fine and dandy but i 'm not here for lectures . 
  cheers . 
   you 're saying that anyone that opposes measures that would demonstrably save lives , regardless of what they are , again , that is not what i am saying . 
  what i am saying is ; should israel remove racial profiling even though it undoubtebly saves lives and works very efficiently because you have a particular ideology ? 
   expand on and develop your initial point , or this is what you 're saying . 
  apparently there is no need to expand because you already know everythng . 
  so israel does not have rule of law ? 
  til . 
  are you some kind of expert in airport security and you know better than them ? 
  cuz really go pitch your idea and see how it works ... 
   why not just lock up all dark skinned people to prevent crime ? 
  that 'd save lives , right ? 
  if you wan na play the strawman game , i will not have a discussion with you . 
   and if you agree with locking up all dark skinned people , you 're even more fucked up than i thought . 
  yeah ... 
  i wo n't bother talking to people that refuse to have a conversation . 
   one of the unfairest points was forcing germany to assume the full responsibility for causing the war , while it was a shared responsibility . 
  so regarding ww2 how did it happen ? 
  let 's face it , if france and poland had split germany in 1919 , nothing would have happened . 
  that is different and i agree with you . 
  i do not think that racial profiling for tax issues ( for example : he 's black how does he have the money ) is a good thing . 
   now ask a hundred different people their definition of `` as long as it 's not abused '' . 
  simple : racial profiling for busting small time drug dealers , pickpotters , hooligans is pointess . 
  racial profiling at an airport where you got ta pass people through quickly ( if you have long queues , they become a security risk ... see bxl airport ) and it is ** vital ** to have the best security people : racial profiling okay . 
   if your definition of `` works '' is justified as a means to an end works means that the matter is sufficiently important and impacts society sufficiently hard that taking in consideration the full image is important . 
  having [ waves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_al_flight_426_hijacking ) after [ waves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dawson's_field_hijackings ) after [ waves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lufthansa_flight_649 ) of hijackings ( i can continue this list ad nauseam ) is very detrimental to society . 
  it can undermine the morale of the people ( terrorism ... is just that ) , it can cause severe economic issues , it can push for more extremism in society . 
  trying to bust marijuana users or pickpotters ... fuck racial profiling . 
  thats pointless and petty . 
  major terrorism issues ... oh that 's more important . 
  many people risk their lives . 
  confining people for a long time in front of security gates creates a security issue . 
  so having to do is a quickly as possible is important . 
  you can play the `` dictatorship '' card but israeli airports are safe . 
  i 'm sure at certain points in time you 'll take them too and you 'll appreciate being in a safe environment . 
  and you can do whatever the hell you want . 
  but you and / u/blondgingerviking ** can not ** claim that an algorithm that also includes race does * not * work since that is patently false . 
  lets separate ideology from facts . 
   because you are discriminating against an entire race , because a few might be criminals . 
  so you 'd shelf a measure that saves lives because of ideological reasons ... okay ... 
  wow great debate mate . 
  so you 're okay with racial profiling in israel ? 
  again if you just look at people that are of a certain race to inspect sure . 
  but you use a series of factors just like the israelis do it : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-wagner/what-israeli-airport-secu_b_4978149.html it 's a mix of factors ... 
   they 'll justifiably feel like their skin color makes them guilty until proven innocent as far as law enforcement is concerned law enforcement does not pass guilty sentences ... 
   plus , it does n't work . 
  never go to israel then man because you will be shocked : racial profiling is done ... and it works . 
   this is what the eurocup and europe should be all about . 
  this is what it is about . 
  just been on the promenade biking . 
  irish fans taking pics with polish ones . 
  eerybody is having a nice time , beer in hand . 
  enjoying the lovely weather and the turquoise water . 
  some people are chanting for their team . 
  honestly 20-30 people throwing some punches is not ** at all ** representative of the general picture . 
  my fellow colonial friend , every continent has a bit of france on it . 
  we skinned and killed those savage natives but it was for the glory of our culture . 
  why is anyone surprised about this ? 
  [ basil did say he did n't vote for it ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x27pqdy_fawlty-towers-s01e06-the-germans_shortfilms?start=1602 ) he starts talking about the common market then a couple of seconds later he mentions it ,
