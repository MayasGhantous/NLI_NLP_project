  i thought you were extremelly fair in asking what my actual opinion was instead of going on a rant and assuming what my opinion is like it happens all too often on reddit . 
  this creates a spiral of shit slinging that we kinda see often and that is very time and nerve consumming . 
  it 's a shame more discussions can not be constructive because here a lot of people come from so many different backgrounds and countries and one can learn a lot . 
  you 're comparing a bunch of people throwing fists with a fucking terrorist attack . 
  that 's beyond dumb . 
  move on because i 'll start ignoring you . 
   if you can \u00b4 t prevent brawls inside stadiums , there is no guarantee you can prevent terrorist attacks . 
  i had enough patience with you , but honestly you can go pound sand . 
  i 'm fucking tired of disgusting pricks that can not wait for terrorist attacks . 
  look 50 people dead in orlando . 
  go rub one off thinking about that . 
  the bulgarians should have qualified for the euro . 
  btw this is n't a joke . 
  these are n't exactly private beaches . 
  restaurants rent a part of it from the local community and put some tables and what have you . 
  but you are free to walk on the sea front . 
  no one will tell you anything . 
  so it 's not like they 're closed off or anything . 
  the sea front is all public access in nice . 
  the french police stopped arresting . 
  see the huge protests against the reforms concerning work conditions . 
  you 'd have big big scuffles with the police and only 10-15 arrests at most . 
  maybe because the prisons are already overloaded . 
  arrest 400 people , then you have to try them etc etc. 
  for what ? 
  breaking 5 store windows and burning a bar ? 
  considering that the most resources need to be focused at the terrorism threat . 
  ( hence why your : put undercover cops where you have 20 locals is pure stupidity ) . 
  a brawl is inconvenient . 
  a terrorist attack is a massive disaster . 
   is it that hard for you to admit that the russians are in the wrong too ? 
  the russians are much more in the wrong on the stadium . 
  in nice it 's apparent that a group of 20 locals were being stupid . 
  in marseille outside the stadium who did what i do n't know since i was n't there . 
  all 3 parts were involved . 
  russians , english and french locals . 
  concerning the french police they are hands off until shit hits the fan and that 's when they go in baton in hand ready to dish out some woopass . 
  the thing is that common narrative seems to be the english were minding their own business . 
  and they got viciously attacked by the french locals then by the police then by russians . 
  this forces a more defensive attitude on my part . 
  i honestly believe the battle between the english and the locals was because both parties were idiots . 
  ( the marseillians because they 're dumb by definition and the english because who the fuck chants about isis , they were being provocative ) . 
  concerning the russians they were by far the most violent ( the brit with his head bashed in ) . 
  and on the stadium of course . 
  if a russian or marseillian or a nicois would come and play they innocent card i 'd be just as dismissive . 
  yes !, 
   i am just going to quote that . 
  good , you learnt something, 
   but still in order to whitewash your country y again ... did you bother reading the comment i replied to ? 
  like take a moment and do it . 
  why do you think i mentioned poland 2012 ? 
  for shits and giggles !, 
  the guy was trying to pretend poland went without a problem and france is utter mayhem . 
  yeah but at least we won a euro  . 
  we won two actually . 
  you should try it man ... it feels nice :d if you can manage to not get a goal at the first kick that is in direction of the goal post . 
  hence the `` self respecting country '' comment   that gives catholic church power of granting state marriage . 
  be that as it may ( even though it 's supremely weird , if you 're religious , you should have your own separate , special and pointless ceremony in your church ) the fact of the matter still remains : civil servants can still perform civil marriages . 
  and that 's what the whole gay marriage is about . 
  there is about 0 gays that want a priest to be forced to marry them . 
   you can put undercover cops around fans ** it 's 20 locals ** . 
  how the hell do you put an undercover cop under 20 locals that know the area to perfection ? 
   a lot of this football violence is agent provocateurs ( a french concept by the way )  ) fuck me you 're salty . 
  provocateurs a french concept . 
  that 's rich . 
  what next ? 
  beef is also a french concept ? 
  and pork ? 
   you can do things like forbidding the sale of drinks fuck that . 
  i wo n't drink my wine in plastic bottles because some idiots wan na see a bunch of rich retards hit a ball . 
   it \u00b4 s weird , in euro 2012 there were all these doomsday predictions about violent ultras and racism and bad planning , but ** it went out fine ** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9328626/euro-2012-poland-sports-minister-ashamed-as-polish-and-russian-hooligans-cause-violence-on-warsaw-streets.html 154 polish arrested , 24 russians . 
  that 's fine for you ? 
   and it \u00b4 s only day 3 . 
  it happened 4 days after the start ... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mo3qzd1cln0 dude go troll sole other place cuz you 're boring . 
  ca n't even google . 
  geesh . 
  salt ? 
  his comment is brilliant  ), 
   there is also the issue of how fair the versailles treaty was . 
  it is often stated that it 's harsh terms brought germany to financial ruin , opening the path to power for hitler . 
  define fairness ? 
  is splitting germany in two ( actually more ) parts with one under a oppressive communist regime that was under full control of moscow a fairer deal than versailles ? 
  besides a control of the ruhr mines between 23-25 , i fault to see what massive unfair treatment germany got . 
  let 's not forget how brutal ww1 . 
   i find it distastful when gay rights movements are trying to strong arm the church into marrying them through legistlation . 
  holy shit . 
  this has got to be the single most ignorant comment i read this week on reddit . 
  there are about 0 gay people that wan na force any big religious institution to marry them . 
  you can not be so ignorant as to think `` marriage = religious ceremony happening in the church '' , right ? 
  cuz the religious ceremony in any normal self respecting society has ** zero ** value to the state . 
  wow , i am saving our comment . 
  someone that believes gay marriage means telling the pope that he should make religious ceremonies for the gays . 
  i did n't think people like you existed . 
  :d darn you are a good laugh . 
  i 'm saving your comment . 
  some context http://www.nicematin.com/faits-divers/videos-violents-affrontements-dans-le-vieux-nice-apres-angleterre-russie-56524 the nirish were drinking in an irish pub . 
  about 20 locals showed up . 
  they started singing . 
  a bottle was thrown apparently at the irish and then bottles started flying around . 
  it 's not exactly ww2 ,
