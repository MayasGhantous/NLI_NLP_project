  http://m.spiegel.de/international/a-423490.html about 400 english hooligans were arrested in 2006 in stuttgart with the city center being blocked . 
  so no , there 's not more to it . 
   piss poor security . 
  http://www.nicematin.com/faits-divers/photos-and-videos-ce-que-lon-sait-des-violents-affrontements-entre-supporters-a-nice-la-nuit-derniere-56635 only about 20 frenchmen were involved . 
  you ca n't micromanage everything you know . 
   their private beaches have you ... uhm ... been to nice ? 
  from carras to vieux port tell me ** one ** private beach . 
  / u/executivemonkey 's banter is really improving . 
  he has fewer flops . 
  i guess him/her spending more time amongst people from a superior continent is helping . 
  kek . 
  way to avoid what / u/virgindognotreally was pointing at . 
  it 's all about dodging when you do n't wan na address an issue . 
   independence from whom ? 
  early ? 
  we 're not in the same time zone friend , 
   mate there is mayhem in the streets of one of your biggest cities , & nbsp ;  what happens in the stadium should be maybe your biggest care so are you bothered by what issues ? 
  the street violence or the stadium one ? 
  pick one . 
   several are in critical condition from th\u00e9 stadium brawls ? 
  sauce . 
   than security at major events in crowded buildings ? 
  for better or worse , besides a couple of bruises and concussions , no one was badly hurt ( to my knowledge ) . 
  nobody gives a shit if a french hippy gets gassed . 
  if they start going full [ punisher ] ( http://m.huffpost.com/fr/entry/9728566 ) on foreigners the higher ups might disagree . 
   have you even driven around marseille ? 
  like , take the motorway from the north to the center for instance . 
  since 2012 , they stopped getting moneys, 
  that . 
  but also how the hooligan population just auto-regulates itself . 
  :d makes me chuckle a bit . 
  oh wait ... should i be outraged ? 
  omg what will other europeans think of us : / oh noes . 
  people get smacked in the stadiums . 
  gah i feel guilty now :(, 
  you can read my previous comment because honestly i do n't have more shits to give : / . 
  i wish i would , but i do n't . 
  : s okay it 's a bit hilarious i admit . 
  did you just go ww2 ? 
  it 's a fucking game , you primadonna :d darn this is gold . 
   ) quick quick say how we 'd all be speaking german without you  ) . 
  god you people get salty when you know your team will go home soon . 
   tear gassed for chanting . 
  oh yeah just chanting ? 
  did you see the videos of them tearing up cafes in marseille ? 
  throwing bottles at the french police ? 
   women and children charged at by russian hooligans . 
  :d dude you should get a job at the guardian . 
  you 're the type that when talking about refugees would just mention women and children . 
   it 's obvious for almost a century the french do n't understand the concept of self defense . 
  dude the amount of salt , 
  do n't make the mistake of thinking that the french society gives a crap about what happens on a stadium  we have bigger fish to fry . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/11/england-and-russia-fans-clash-in-marseilles-ahead-of-euro-2016-g/ now they 're defying head injuries huh ? 
  yeah . 
  i agree the police should have been more direct : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/10/english-football-fans-clash-with-locals-in-marseille-ahead-of-eu/ here 's english fans chanting `` isis where are you '' and `` isis we love you '' . 
  those people should get arrested according to french law . 
  goddamn it . 
  the crs should descend upon them but i guess they do n't want the bad press . 
  so every man for himself . 
  weird that it does n't happen with other fans though . 
  weird indeed . 
  the fact that you were a joke and you 're not slightly rising above that ? 
  [ and just as many casualties ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/11/england-and-russia-fans-clash-in-marseilles-ahead-of-euro-2016-g/ ), 
  if i were british i 'd be against it . 
  but i 'm not . 
  i honestly believe in the long run it will be better for everyone . 
  i also think it wo n't happen . 
  it 's okay . 
  it 's england we 're talking about here , after all . 
  they 'll leave soon enough . 
  1 overall with a very easy team that have tons of gaps ... 
   the eu 's rule making , its absolute arrogance & nbsp :  equal partners in the marriage bed vs a non-consensual dom-sub basement sex dungeon sure , there 's coitus , but they 're hardly equal scenarios . 
  of irrational rants ? 
  yeah . 
  stop after like 2 sentences . 
  i 'll admit your wall of text is way too long so i wo n't bother reading man : / . 
  let 's hope that [ on the 27th of november 2017 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/27/newsid_4187000/4187714.stm ) we will think about a man that was 50 years ahead of his time . 
  uk is part of many international treaties that produce laws which supersede national uk laws . 
  it 's not like it 's a surprise or unprecedented . 
  it 's how international law works . 
  so marseille ultras made the english throw beer cans at the police ? 
  riiiight . 
  we tried to conquer them once to civilise them a bit . 
  but they only learnt one or two words for meat : beef , pork , venison . 
   but most of the initial violence has been coming from russians . 
  english fans started making problems since a few days ago . 
  http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/06/10/incidents-entre-supporters-a-marseille-un-anglais-et-un-francais-en-garde-a-vue-2395521-6089.php they started throwing beer cans at the police . 
   it would be indicative of principle if anything at all . 
  no it just shows they lack political knowledge . 
  switzerland is already out of the erasmus because of the immigration vote right ? 
   stealing our jobs det tekkin er jerbs . 
   keeping our wages down i am sure the torries cant wait to raise the income levels for workers but they just ca n't cuz the eu amirite ? 
  uk wants to leave because gypsies are cutting some trees and killing a deer . 
  ! remind me 12 days, 
   if poland gets to quaterfinals wtf ? 
  the simply have o qualify from the group ? 
  that 's not really that tough ... 
  the institute restaurant organised a `` guess the score game '' . 
  i was hoping one or two colleagues would throw me a bone or at least put an even score . 
  nope .
