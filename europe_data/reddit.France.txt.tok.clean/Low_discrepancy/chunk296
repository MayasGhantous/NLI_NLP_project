  none . 
  darn people are competitive . 
   people might support restrictions on free movement but not a total withdraw from the eu . 
  who are these people you mention ? 
   there is a reason in so many countries for example a wife can not be forced to provide evidence against their husband . 
  yes but if a wife supports a husband while said husband commits an illegal act , then she will also face the justice system . 
  uk wo n't leave the eu . 
  we all know that . 
  i 'll bet reddit gold on it . 
  it 's one of those obvious things . 
  yes obama will beat romney , yes sarkozy will lose in 2012 , no scotland wo n't leave , yes trump and clinton will win the nominations , no uk wo n't leave , yes clinton will win . 
  i respect uks right to leave the eu . 
  i do n't assume malice but the sheer audacity of it all . 
  so you ca n't convince your people ... in ** your own ** country and now you wan na go to ** the whole ** of the eu saying : guys we should restrict free movement . 
  i mean does n't it seem surprising to you ? 
   how might the uk ruin the eu for everyone ? 
  if uk pushes for a restriction for free movement for itself , then of course in the official treaties it will be a general comment saying any state can reduce it if so and so conditions apply . 
  that creates a precedent ... 
  i do not underestimate uk 's capability to annoy everybody . 
   what has reddit , this post and r/europe to do with radio free europe ? 
  uhm ... did you check the website of this post ? 
  here 's its about section : http://www.rferl.mobi/p/4481.html, 
   you can look up the number of participating troops from the table above . 
  but as / u/glideer has mentioned , it also shows exercises performed in asia ... that 's a bit misleading . 
  i believe such a graph would be very important but there are kinks to it that need to be corrected . 
   large circle is  50k personnel , small one < 50k , the little asterisk says that all but one of the russian circle might have been the same exercise . 
  holly shit i missed that one . 
  :d that is ridiculous . 
  / r/dataisugly it does n't even show how many soldiers are stationed in each part of the map . 
  i 'm assuming that you 're british and you realise the difference between  ** want to ** ruin it for everybody else . 
  and  ** going to ** ruin it for everyone ? 
  i will not let a pig fucker chip away at my rights as eu citizen . 
  oh those people should go pound sand . 
  they ca n't convince 50 % of ** their ** people to leave the eu so they want to ruin it for everybody else . 
  nope . 
  not gon na happen . 
   are ** mostly ** criminals , leech welfare or refuse to integrate , it should definitely be voiced . 
  got any numbers on that, 
  well it 's not exactly france 's problem , is it ? 
  be that as it may , france most likely is against romania in schengen because it would make it much more difficult to expulse them . 
  nowadays since romania is n't in schengen they can remove any romanian that has no job/place to live/arrival ticket to france more recent than 90 days . 
  once the roma issue will be settled , i 'm sure it will be much more easier for romania to join schengen . 
   to contribute through taxes to his parents ' pension . 
  well pensions are already shit in europe , so people who leave actually send money home to support their parents . 
   in addition to that , a significant portion of people leave their children behind while working in we . 
  are you talking about brain drain ? 
  emigration of educated people or not ? 
  because no-one with higher education working in a high level job in the west would leave their children behind ... 
  it 's the low skilled people who make little money that are forced to leave their children home . 
   ussr all of moldova ussr could have taken that in 40 or in 44 . 
  nothing would have stopped it . 
  stalin simply had 0 reason to because moldova full was n't part of the russian empire which he wanted to resurrect . 
   basically the fate of poland . 
  uhm again , the ussr took regions that were part of its former empire ( and also in many many parts populated in majority by ukrainians or belorussians ) . 
  i can not say what the plans of the germans were . 
  occupying the oil fields would deffo have ranked high . 
  but no , romania would n't have risked more from russia . 
  simply because in 45 , nothing actually happened . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm sure dexit will kill it :d, 
   the referendum has been in the making for 6 years just 6 years ? 
  why does it feel like a much much longer period ? 
   i also think that the alliance with germany was the lesser of two evils , why ? 
  i fail to see why being neutral would have been a bad thing . 
  and the only argument against joining russia would be that hitler would have destroyed romania just like he did with greece and serbia . 
  romania should have remained neutral in 1940 . 
  that would force it to be attacked by germany . 
  it could have quickly surrendered and play it out like france . 
  lose some land but no need to invade other territories . 
   another option would have been physical anihilation you probably mean physical anihilation caused by germany because i see no reason why russia would attack romania proper . 
  romania did n't suffer an anihilation in 45 at the hands of russians so i doubt they 'd suffer it in 40 . 
  check hitler 's discussion with mannerheim . 
  stalin stopped at lands that he believed were his from therussian empire . 
  at the same time the parents of that person contributed through taxes so that the person could get an education . 
  also not everybody that leaves is highly educated and highly skilled . 
  i wonder what type of stochastic process it would be . 
  a hawkes process maybe ? 
  france is temporarily suspending schengen . 
  though it 's a bit odd . 
  to go to spain by plane i had to go through customs . 
  to go italy by plane no customs . 
  so it 's not 100 % obvious how this works . 
   a lot things need to be shipped from afar . 
  well that 's why the empire came to be after all . 
   favourite : british isles ( which is really underrated ) eh , we did n't lose a worthy palate this time . 
  you mean / u/smsjohnson makes [ this ] ( http://www.traiteur-verdier.com/images/photo1-2.jpg ) ? 
   who do everything together like cooking together ? 
   before many other western nations . 
  citation needed , because you legalised you after uk , germany , france , austria , us . 
  murfatlar has some great ( red ) wines . 
  others are from the cotnari vineyards , white ( t\u0103m\u00e2ioas\u0103 rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 doux with hints of basil i love it , fr\u00e2ncu\u0219\u0103 ) en ce qui concerne le tourisme urbain en roumanie , le jeu n'en vaut pas la chandelle . 
  bof , bof . 
   poland/ukraine border i was told borders are useless because baddies will always find a way . 
  but ... but i was told border controls are no good and schengen is heaven . 
  sarcasm does n't translate well over the internet . 
  can we just wait and see what will happen ? 
  we had the same convos during the egyptair crash . 
  terrorism , said the egyptian authorities and everybody . 
  now it seems that it had to return 3 times because of some problems on board . 
  let 's wait and see what will happen .
