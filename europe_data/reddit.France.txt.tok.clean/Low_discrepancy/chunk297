  well not refugee queue . 
  cuz they 'd be refused there since uk is a safe country . 
  just in the queue of any normal immigrant that decided to live in the eu . 
  uhm , canada is n't uk https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_canada canada does ** 10 ** times more business with the us than with the whole of the eu . 
  you can not compare things that have no business being compared . 
  the eu will act like a block and nothing of serious will happen . 
   they could reach an agreement that serves both parties nothing will happen . 
  the eu will act like a block . 
  so if uk wants to be lenient with french and german nationals but screw over romanians or bulgarians ... that 's not going to happen . 
  it will demand equal treatment and it will most likely get it . 
  so actually ... no much will happen . 
   we love ** organised ** queues !, 
  you 'll be waiting in those queues with chinese , arabs and south americans my friend : / . 
  you seem to gloss over * the secret police which was extremely well organised and very oppressive . 
  700k informers . 
  that 's a fuckton . 
  no wonder sri has so many agents . 
  * the fact that his economic policies destroyed romania : having to wait long long hours in queues to buy some milk . 
  romania had ** the worst ** communist regime at the time in the world ( bar nkorea ) . 
  china was beginning to open up , russians were living ok . 
   if you came legally , you can stay . 
  of course . 
  you can come in legally and have your status expire . 
  most commonly it happens with students that have finished their studies and are forced to take a job asap . 
  it 's okay though . 
  the eu will reply in equal measure . 
  imposing residence permits on british nationals . 
  brits like french and spanish administration right ? 
  waiting on long queues . 
  when you add unemployed and students that have finished their studies and now have to find work asap , those numbers rise pretty quickly . 
  i think you managed to completely forget that europe gets refugees from iraq , afghanistan , syria . 
  you do n't get to pick and choose refugees that come from war torn countries . 
  you can not deport them back to where they came from . 
   yea , this happened to us in australia , nobody cares . 
  you do realise that the ecthr has no jurisdiction on australia right ? 
  surely you know that australia is not bound to european organisations : from the eu/ecthr up to the euro cup and eurovision . 
  so saying that you do n't care about a law that does n't even affect you , does n't say much . 
  if you backpedal on all the agreements you 've made , you can not play they `` common sense measures '' card . 
   because russia would bomb a european safe zone ? 
  wtf ? 
  : / i have some very bad news for you ... 
  ever heard of minsk 1 ? 
  hey in principle it 's amazing . 
  we 're talking here about practice . 
  and in practice that safe zone would have russian planes flying overhead . 
  as soon as a syrian opposition soldier seeks safe haven there , you 'll have bombs dropped by mistake . 
   like germany and usa are talking about making safe zones there . 
  yeah . 
  safe zones ... from al assad ? 
  are you joking ? 
  germany and the us have no power in the region . 
  that is obvious from the fact that he 's still attacking aleppo despite the cease-fire . 
   afghanistan is a war zone too and germany is sending people back there with the argument that not all parts of aghanistan are equally much a war zone . 
  those people leave voluntarily . 
  the issue here is about people that do n't want to leave ...  he says ( i think ) that un should create centers let 's say at the various refugee camps and you can apply for asylum there . 
  these things are already done . 
  the main point again is the fact that no : illegally entering a country does not mean you lose the right to asylum . 
  say someone stow-aways on a plane/boat from north korea and they arrive in europe . 
  this dude wants to send such a person back to north korea . 
  that 's hella stupid and will get you country condemned by the echr . 
  so it 's all on greece ? 
  yeah that sounds faiir / s, 
   he talks common sense measures , so he is probably a imperialist , colonialist and a racist fascist with only darkness in his heart . 
  some of the measures are not common sense . 
   says they should be brought back to the country of origin . 
  says a deal with places like libya could be made . 
  lybia is a war zone . 
  sorry , it 's not a safe country . 
   firstly europe should make it clear that anybody who is trying to reach europe illegally is losing their claim on asylum . 
  you mean the only way to obtain refugee status is if you applied in the embassy where your country is ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how any of it works . 
  that 's how you get your country condemned by the echr . 
   i do n't understand how a city like paris mostly because those are n't in paris . 
  you do know that 2 were iraqi refugees right ? 
  let 's not be silly here . 
  also the abdeslams were n't even born in france . 
  the majority have lived for a long time in belgium . 
  yeah . 
  since this shit happens in uk and not many other eu countries , this clearly means it 's the fault of the eu . 
  thank you alps . 
  you 've done good . 
  that 's the joke, 
  france recognised it in 2001 . 
   he wrote one in favour for it in favor of the genocide ? 
   the us embassy , as the embassies of any other country , are promoting the business interests of their country 's companies . 
  in this case they promoted a corrupted business . 
   on the other hand , the us embassy in romania played an important role in the cancellation of the contract with bechtel , in ensuring that the company would not request hundreds of millions in damages from romania , for the early cancellation of the contract . 
  after it became a farse of a contract ( where costs doubled 2.7 billion to 4.8 billion , schedules well do you know when they 'll finish actually ? ) . 
  since it was a us company , then the us govt would have had to be involved in this corruption issue but `` amazingly '' did n't do anything and now you 've got people who praise them . 
  dude you sure are gullible . 
  also look how close the us govt and bechtel are in kosovo and albania : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/14/us-ambassador-kosovo-construction-contract-firm-highway oh and let 's not mention the cia torture prisons that were on romanian and polish soil and that normally should have cost them the accession to the eu because it was so utterly against human rights . 
  so they give a huge contract to an american company without any open bidding process and you 're telling me no one from the us govt was involved . 
  yeah ... 
  i want to believe , but i 'm not thaaat gullible . 
  romanians also sometimes eat at mcdonalds . 
   us played and plays a positive role in that it supports the anti-corruption drive proven by bechtel . 
  they 'd better invest in cybersecurity because that 's where the actual risk is . 
  i fail to see why uk would implement visas for the eu . 
  it would mean automatic visas for them too , and i doubt they 'd want that ... at all .
