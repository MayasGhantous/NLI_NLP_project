  and since they 're students they get the right to be on uk soil automatically . 
  the thing that might change : students that have finished their studies and now have to find work . 
  they might have to leave earlier if no job is available . 
   airbus has an actual proper headquarters in leiden , in the netherlands , airbus headquarters is in toulouse . 
  airbus group also moved their main office there . 
  and their headquarters for legalese issues remains in the netherlands . 
   and i repeat it , our crisis is n't caused by corruption , but corruption is a symptom of it . 
  okay . 
  we can agree on that . 
  but similarly could be said about the us with the banking industry ( or more so uk ) . 
  with fn being as high as they are ( they went from being the ** 6th ** party to the ** 1st ** in the european elections ) . 
  and we 're still a bit salty because we voted no in 2005 referendum and we got a yes . 
  and now of course the deficit will not decrease as quickly because hey we got ta invests in the army ( terrorism threats and all that ) . 
  only 2 countries are relevant in the eu when dealing with army and projection of force . 
  so junker can go eat some coq au vin . 
  yeah sure . 
  that 's super easy and comes at no cost . 
  why do n't people just do that ' it 's so obvious . 
  yeah . 
  airbus/eads , siemens were never involved in corruption . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-03/airbus-raided-in-corruption-probe-over-romania-and-saudi-arabia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens_greek_bribery_scandal c'mon man . 
  heck replace spain with france . 
  are you telling me we 're super corrupt and germany simply has its shit together ? 
   your point being ?? 
  they can either participate in establishing the norms and standards or they can be told what to do if they want us to buy their crap . 
  he indeed is very witty but i believe you can definitely achieve half of that . 
  and what 's netherlands biggest trade partners ? 
  thanks , 
  yes . 
  i 'm sure netherlands can also play the commonwealth card . 
  they can do trade with uhm ... indonesia ? 
   or , governments are just incompetent and full of corruption ... yeah sure . 
  germany is virtuous while spain is corrupted . 
  sure why not . 
  to the surprise of no one . 
  only if we no longer have universal health care . 
   i 'm not mistaken ( not very reliable quick count ) , so sadly does not met the 2k criteria i proposed above !, 
   and i 'm a shit poster of the lowest ( highest ? ), 
  kind . 
   i believe someone with 1k , 5k , etc. 
  of karma ( only / r/europe karma of course ) is someone who the / r/europe community has positively valued . 
  have you met / u/low _ discrepancy ? 
   which entities citizens how could we get such an agreement ? 
  airbus group ( former eads ) is dutch too . 
  so is renault nissan . 
   erasums exists thanks to the eu , that 's what he is thanking for . 
  yes but erasmus exists in non eu countries too . 
   eu also helps students from the rest of europe come and study in the uk if they wish . 
  you know erasmus wo n't stop existing right ? 
  erasmus existed/exists in countries that were n't / arent part of the eu . 
  you know all this right ? 
   what i 'd like to see is the departures board and general chaos in malpensa airport that night . 
  i was leaving seville as the supporters were going to basel for the euro cup final . 
  they 'd have special check-in areas and everything just for them . 
  i saw maybe 8 flights leaving in the morning to basel on the departure screens . 
  except the french forgot for our presidential plane and it appeared on flight radar sauce http://www.europe1.fr/societe/une-faille-majeure-permet-de-pister-les-vols-du-president-de-la-republique-2732059, 
   for the next two months , the government plans to give polish schools the option of ** teaching up to four hours a week ** of classes on the world 's most powerful military alliance -- and the benefits that poland derives from being a member of it . 
  holy ... 4 hours per week is huge . 
  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4_wtgv8ao here 's one from the mormons . 
  it 's so annoying when people simply can not see the obvious banter . 
  ( plus to some extremists that 's they 're speech exactly ) . 
   from what i heard life is very painful for north africans , the road is paved with racism and trading homophobia for that is not exactly the best deal . 
  come again ? 
  if you wan na study engineering you wo n't face any sort of discrimination . 
  30 % of students in the maths section of my top grande ecole were maghrebins and did n't face any sort of employment disrimination . 
  they went on to do phds , work in major banks like bnp , barclay 's , big companies like schlumberger and airbus . 
  i think you are not fully aware of the actual situation . 
  do you think you go in your major company and people look at you and where you 're from ? 
   also , staying after graduation is not guaranteed . 
  that law that forced students to find jobs in the 6mo ` ths after graduation was repelled . 
  racism is generally a problem that people from lower classes suffer because they come into contact with lower class natives . 
  if you 're sufficiently bright enough to end in a good engineering school , you have it made . 
  yeah ... a committee . 
   exactly !, 
  i do n't know how they managed to survive for a thousand years . 
  ever been to venice , man ? 
  ever seen those impressive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horses_of_saint_mark ? 
  those are a replica , but they also have the original . 
  do you know where the original comes from ? 
  how they were obtained ? 
  care to guess ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/campo_santi_giovanni_e_paolo ever see that statue in venice ? 
  care to guess who it is ? 
  a famous condottiere . 
  do you know what those people used to do ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/condottieri so unless venice magically becomes ** again ** a city state that can form armies of pirates and mercenaries that can sack other regions of the world , there 's little shit they can do . 
  ( and they better have a good navy cuz people have nukes nowadays ) . 
  has the adriatic sea becomes ** again ** a major sea trade region ... not much will happen . 
  wait that 's not possible since 1 ) there are other routes and trade is fairly minimal in that area . 
  2 ) the amount of shipping vessels will rape that region . 
  so what else can they do ? 
  oh yeah morano glass . 
  so their hope is to sell fancy glass cups to foreigners . 
  by mail , cuz apparently tourists are bad . 
  you know who is ** modern day venice ** : friggin singapore because that 's where the trade money is . 
  venice , much like monaco existed because of a fluke of history . 
  that fluke disappeared so those areas will disappear too unless they do something else . 
  in the case of venice , tourism . 
  in the case of monaco ( which became extremely poor and lost 95 % of its territory ) casinos , and now jet-setters . 
  a few extremely rich people that wan na evade taxes .
