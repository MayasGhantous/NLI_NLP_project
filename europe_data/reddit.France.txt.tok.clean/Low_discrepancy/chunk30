  :d france signed it too . 
  guatemala and ethiopia . 
  india . 
  this is too good . 
  i did n't know this tidbit . 
  supplemented by social protection . 
  in the us . 
  this is gewd . 
  i noticed later you added to your comment , you can ignore it . 
   not civil i am not civil but i do not attack the person . 
  this avoid creating a toxic conversation that simply turns around insults . 
  i hope you can realise the difference because it will help you conversational skills . 
   is a bald-faced lie . 
  cant you ctrl+f your comment for `` even though it is not legally binding '' . 
  you will find it . 
   [ the udhr ] served as the foundation for a growing number of national laws , international laws , and treaties , as well as for a growing number of regional , sub national , and national institutions protecting and promoting human rights . 
  again served as a foundation because it was n't law . 
   through treaties which codified it and which were ratified , as is quoted in the text fuck yes . 
  thank you !, 
  finally yes . 
  ** the legally binding things ** are the treaties . 
  in the case of stateless people : it 's the 1961 convention that you already mentioned . 
  if you now can finally go at the first debate http://www.slate.fr/story/112291/droit-creer-des-apatrides http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1760211-20160105-decheance-nationalite-si-souhaite-france-pourrait-creer-apatrides you can ctrl+f and see those law professors talk about the 1961 treaty and about one from 1997 . 
  ** those are legally binding ** . 
  and in case of national security , according to those agreements , france can create stateless people in cases of national security for example . 
  i will agree with you , that the udhr is the spirit . 
  that 's why in all your examples you 'll see that the udhr is referred to as being fondamental , as being cited etc etc. 
  it 's a declaration but it is not binding . 
  you do n't judge a case based on the udhr , you judge them by the 1961 treaty . 
  it 's pointless to talk about the article 15 of udhr . 
  it 's like citing the libert\u00e9 fraternit\u00e9 \u00c9galit\u00e9 motto . 
  yes it 's the motto of france , yes it is in the consitution , yes it 's part of our ideals and the spirit but no they 're not legally biding . 
  the people in the articles are way more competent than i am and unless you 're an expert on french consitutional law , they 're more competent than you . 
  any discussion ** on the legality ** of rendering people stateless , has to be carried out ** on legal binding documents ** . 
  the legal binding documents ** are the treaties ** . 
  what ? 
  it was in the comment you wrote . 
  ** not legally binding ** in several parts of wall of text . 
  i have nothing to add because you inundated the debate with like you say low quality information . 
  i wo n't fall for a falkenhayn strategy . 
  you refuse to address the fact that again it is ** not ** legally binding . 
  no need to add 100 links and 20 pointless comments on how great the udhr . 
  it 's pointless to talk because you either go for ad hominems or strawmen without admitting the obvious that i 'll repeat again ** not legally binding ** . 
  finally we agree on something . 
   do n't lecture me on civility when you have a comment history in this discussion full of fucks and shits and condescenion . 
  you 're a hypocrite if you do that . 
  i am not civil but i do n't insult you personally . 
  i realise that different might be subtle for you . 
   you still do n't understand . 
  there 's nothing to understand . 
  udhr is not legally binding . 
  it is not international law , it is not a treaty . 
  several links i provided showed that . 
   in its preamble , governments commit themselves and their people to progressive measures which secure the universal to be read as : we 'll do it when we 'll feel like it . 
   ** even though it is not legally binding , ** oh look at that it was in your quote . 
  again let 's repeat : #even though it is not legally binding ,  in 1998 it was hailed as `` a magna carta for all humanity '' . 
  well is n't that nice . 
  my oh my what nice words . 
  truly nice words , the best words . 
   france is in big trouble , and not just from rampant muslim fundamentalism in the banlieues . 
  eh , we 'll survive . 
    giving a legal status to ** most ** of the declaration so not all . 
  my oh my what a surprise . 
  you give a wall of text and you continue as hominem attacks when it 's simple . 
  udhr is not legally binding . 
  you yourself realise that , because it is in your quotes . 
  but hey , i 'm sure that if you continue with the ad hominem , insults and strawmen you will sure convince me . 
  two of the terrorists in paris were refugees though . 
  so there 's that . 
  again i do n't know what that means for the over all picture , just stating facts . 
   you may want to shave so that you remain unhassled by certain few undesirable idiots who are in the grip of panic . 
  if he 's gon na run into crazies , do you think the beard might make the slightest difference ? 
  the russians just happen to be tourists right ? 
  why ? 
  clearly he learnt his lesson . 
  ready to be integrated into society . 
  also denmark confused me since they send a lot of isis fighters per capita . 
  well msf was founded by the french so  abandon their work at this moment in time , when even they say things are getting worse is a thing we a lot . 
   what is your mental problem can you comment without insulting ? 
   i refer to human rights when i refer to udhr art . 
  15 , ~ ~ which is not part of international law . ~ ~ ~ ~ correction : it 's part of international law but does not create any legal obligations . ~ ~ ** not a treaty ** . 
  re-correction : ugh it 's a declaration , it 's not binding , it 's not part of international law : http://www.lrwc.org/education/international-law/non-treaty-standards/  what follows is a list of declarations and other international human rights instruments which may not have the binding force of international law , per se . 
  and the first is ** udhr ** . 
  so let 's repeat :  #may not have the binding force of international law , per se . 
  the aussie article should have convinced you of that . 
   1961 un convention on the reduction of statelessness , which aims to avoid incidents of statelessness . 
  fucking ** finally ** . 
  hallelujah you mentioned something that is indeed a treaty . 
  https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=treaty&amp;mtdsg_no=v-4&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en see ? 
  it 's even in the url . 
  yeah about that one , there are provisions that make it possible to create stateless people . 
  hence my initial articles from huffington post . 
  you take that sarcastic tone back , mister . 
  one day you too might go in a foreign country and decapitate people and when you come back you 'll want to be treated like we treat the jihadists now . 
  have a little empathy . 
  i love your optimism man . 
  do n't change . 
   authoritarian backward thinking in a nutshell . 
  i 'm sorry i do n't wan na mollycoddle terries . 
  : s. fuck nazis and fuck terrorists .
