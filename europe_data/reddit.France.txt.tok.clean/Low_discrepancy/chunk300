  glass maybe ? 
  but we 're already experts at that . 
  turning into a massive industrial port ? 
  is that better than tourism ? 
  no.not at all . 
   if an entire section of a city becomes pedestrian it is good for tourists , who usually do n't arrive by car anyway , but the locals have to adapt . 
  why not mention paris then ? 
  do you think the quais and other parts became pedestrian to please the tourists ? 
  a city as polluted as paris , where you have 3 smog alerts per year ? 
  fewer cars is better . 
   we want more high spending tourism like switzerland yeah but you miss the point that you 're not the swiss . 
  you do n't offer skiing as a main attraction ( which is a sport for well off people ) . 
  the level of earning is reduced compared to the swiss so you ca n't really hike the price of restaurants or hotels . 
  and you 're a loud bunch of people that love to party . 
  so yeah you wo n't really attract a ton of older people that just want to sleep after 8 pm . 
  at 12 people still make a ton of noise all over . 
  you can crack down on drunks ( heavy fines , more police , more restrictions on walking about inebriated ) , but there 's not much else you can do man . 
   `` whities taking our beaches '' and then they turn brown and then they take your herb . 
   there already are millions of russians in germany , and their loyalty lies solely with russia . 
  russian sleeper agents ? 
  the area around the arsenale , and to the east side where people live might not be super high class but it 's clean and cosy . 
  you probably mean around the jewish ghetto ? 
  like you said , people do n't sleep in venice . 
  but then again maestre train station is 30 mins away with regular trains and you can walk across venice in 90 mins tops . 
  so it 's really small . 
  do n't know if it applies to every city though . 
   if you limit that to american tourists in spain or europe not in paris . 
  they 're waay too loud . 
  :d so we let you in for your uncanny sense of humour ? 
  that 's fine by me . 
   an average european the average european does n't really get a say . 
  i did n't get one during the lybian invasion , the mali mission or the bombing of syria . 
  and in fact , i do n't really care that much as long as our presence is n't too large . 
   simply do n't see the need to spend more on military . 
  i really doubt that an italian , spaniard or portuguese would see the imediate importance of a massive increase in military spending . 
  you have to view things in their eyes also . 
  french military spending would be directed at counter-terrorist activities and not on the russian problem . 
  i never understood this matra of 2 % . 
  what magic happens at 2 % ? 
  do wars stop ? 
  heck montenegro does n't spend 2 % ( it 's at 1.39 % ) and they still got in nato . 
  what gives ? 
   until the war in ukraine happened , people simply did n't feel any big imminent threat to europe shit was brewing ever since the orange revolution . 
  you ca n't really say what happened was out of the blue . 
  dude ... you ca n't give away karma . 
   same could be said about cigarettes but we have the labels . 
  yeah and we do n't know what to do with them : do you put nasty images ? 
  do you make them all white ? 
  that being said : ** one ** important difference ( actually there are tons but i wont go into details ) remains between cigs and alcohol . 
  you can not buy cigs by the unit , so you 'll have to see the label . 
  for alcohol , you can ruin your life before having to buy a bottle . 
  just go to your local pub . 
  so ... this thread is only for irish ? 
   i am willing to bet 10k karma you can not bet that which you do not own . 
   he has the virgin mary tattoed on his left arm i bet that 's his ... uhm ... lets say dominant arm . 
   crucifix tattoed on his right arm . 
  and that 's the stranger . 
   it 's why there ca n't be a viable right wing in europe . 
  a what now ? 
  oh right ... you probably think merkel and cameron are left wing . 
  when your right wing is trump and the republican party things might seem that way . 
   us even has special visas to try and attract foreign talent for the team . 
  every country has those . 
  if you check the graph , it shows a distribution . 
  it 's not a uniform distribution so they had to pick no equal ranges like that . 
  it has the advantage that you can see the differences between groups better . 
  if not , it would be a big map of a single colour . 
   public health warnings if you 're at the table enjoying your meal and a nice glass of wine , you do n't want to hide the bottle because hey you will die if you drink too much . 
  if you 're buying a bottle of fine scotch and wan na keep it in your cabinet , well prepare to erase the labels because you will die if you drink too much . 
  if you 're going to the pub and buy a pint of beer ... 
  i have no idea what you 'll have to do because this law is stupid . 
  we all know alcohol is bad for you when consumed heavily . 
  we all know it 's fattening ( heck * alchohol friggin burns * that shit has calories ) but honest to god , really ? 
  beer should contain just beer , wine just wine ( and the amount of sulfites if any ) . 
  if you buy a friggin tomato you do n't ask what 's in it ( yeah water , what else ? ) . 
  it goes the same here : wine -  fermented grapes ... congrats ) . 
  all * added * stuff ( preservatives , colouring ) should be mentioned . 
  but if i buy a bottle of wine from a local guy i know makes the real deal i do n't want him to be forced to put : ** ingredients : vin 100 % ** . 
   if you are already very drunk to the point where you ca n't read properly , the retailer would be breaking the law by selling you a bottle of alcohol in most countries . 
  jokes are fun . 
  try them , laughing 'll warm you up . 
   no , because most countries already have laws to cover this . 
  the laws are ** if ** the person is inebriated . 
  you 'd be surprised how a ton of drunks really hold their liquor . 
   if someone drives home drunk from a bar , the bar is partially liable for letting them get drunk and drive . 
  what if you parked around the corner ? 
  this is ridiculous . 
   citation needed . 
  given that about 100 % of the population has tasted alcohol and 50 % +1 do not experience any alcohol related problems ? 
  ** in the real world ** : those who suffer problems are heavy consumers ( be it of alcohol or cigarettes ) . 
  there are so many ways to bypass the whole bottle issue that it 's basically retarded to even talk about such a law . 
  if you start passing laws like : all alcohol must be sold in a container ( just like you can not sell cigarettes by the unit ) . 
   just because i enjoy drinking personally because it 's not about drinking . 
  it 's about the aesthetics . 
  for me drinks are an experience . 
  and putting pictures of engorged livers degrades that experience . 
  imagine you 're at the table , enjoying your meal and the patron puts such an obscenity on the table ? 
   but its unreasonable to assume that i would support things like ottomanism fine . 
  but the fact that he used the 2nd person plural is n't wrong . 
   what if i `` attack '' you for having such a weak president and corrupt politicians ?
