  if by you , you mean the french people , sure ... it would be a ( logically ) correct statement . 
  well check your flair . 
  it is not unreasonable to assume you are part of the turkish people and country ... 
   the ferries are covered with his face , there are posters everywhere with erdo\u011fan 's face next to the text `` 563 . year of the conquest '' . 
  eh , it 's either that or some images of you know ... the actual conquest . 
  the english language does not distinguish between second person plural and singular . 
   labels can reduce excessive consumption . 
  i dunno if you ever got drunk , but after a point , your reading skills really take a hit . 
   no one is stopping you from having your wine . 
  if i order a glass of wine , will it it written on the glass ? 
  how about if i order 20 ? 
  it 's a ridiculous thing . 
  unlike tabacco , alcohol in moderation has no real damage . 
  if you bought a bottle of fine scotch and drink a bit every 5 months , nothing bad will happen to you . 
  but now you have an ugly bottle , congrats . 
  the vast majority of people drink responsibly . 
  eh the classical : i found a fallacy in your comment . 
  i win !, 
   then there 's no reason to object , is there ? 
  yes : aesthetical grounds . 
  unlike cigarettes that sell in a box , alcohol is sold in a ton of different containers and the label is very important . 
  i already know alcohol is bad . 
  that 's why i do n't drink much . 
  and what if you buy your alcohol in a pint at the bar ? 
  it 's a ridiculous measure . 
  i have no idea who that friend was . 
  when your actual friend , de gaulle said : `` guys you wo n't like the party . 
  there wo n't be the food you had or anything . '', 
  you guys ( macmillan ) and the whole of europe got suuuper pissed . 
   your labor laws are equivalent to requiring marriage just to have sex and making divorce almost impossible hey anyone can have an opinion . 
  but give us a call when you have an informed one not based on : well i read an article and i talked to a few guys . 
  this is an issue that deals with one of the core interests of a nation : protecting it 's capabilities to strike back . 
   putin has put russian pride over russians needs yes and nato is in the business of showing russians what their actual needs are . 
  c'mon man , let go of the propaganda for a bit and be real . 
   the thing is , a company nightmare is getting stuck paying people it does n't need . 
  the thing is , that 's already possible through either seasonal work and/or limited time contract . 
  you ** do n't ** have to hire people on a full unlimited in time contract . 
  you hire them for a specified period and it that period is extended , you extended the contract . 
  ** question : ** how is that not enough ? 
  your thing would work if there would be no period limited contracts . 
  but those do exist . 
  what i 'm asking here : does ee have actual foreign policy clout . 
  so their power is their capability of nuisance in the eu ... okay but obviously that 's not what people mean when they say ee has little foreign policy clout . 
  uk never got over the fact that it came late to the party . 
   but w/o those 10 or so member states out of 28 on board , an eu foreign policy will always be fairly weak . 
  what kind of power do those countries wield ? 
   quick googling tells me it was dissolved in 1962 . 
  but mexican california still exists right ? 
   people that have been unemployed for a long time and will hardly be able to find a job one day yes . 
  improving pole emploi and making it easier for these people to acquire new skills is the way to improve their chances to get hired . 
  not making it easier to fire people ... 
   giving more rights to workers makes it less interesting for employers to hire people . 
  i thought we moved on from the myth that making it easier to fire people creates more jobs . 
  goddamit it , are we goldfish ? 
   french unemployed move to london to work . 
  only those that find high paying jobs do . 
  the poor ... ca n't really afford the rent . 
  neah man ... we gots to outrage . 
  it 's like people forget every country is in the business of protecting its interests . 
   the finnish guy did present the court doctors statements of his alcoholism as proof of his personal consumption being very high ... doctors fighting the good fight . 
  except if you 're in the first row . 
  the fact that you think that sarko speaks his mind is clear proof you do n't know french politics , sarko or ump . 
   so he can say whatever he thinks , not whatever is the party line . 
  well obviously you 're not french i see . 
  nope . 
  they shipped back any romanian that did n't have a job and was on french soil for more than 3 months . 
  romania is n't in schengen . 
   ah yeah , i forgot that we are n't allowed to be on the offensive anyway . 
  minor mistake eh ? 
  plus germany has no nukes . 
   do you not see why this is terrifying ? 
  why ? 
  austria is small fries . 
   notice how quickly i wrote this ? 
  that 's because i did it from memory without needing to look it up . 
  that line cracked me up . 
  no i think it went that the jews conspired against germany to lose ww1 . 
  nowadays the muslims are conspiring against the west to conquer it . 
   i wonder if you will also excuse the next mass murder . 
  you are a fascinating case . 
  words have no meaning to you . 
  exceptional . 
  amazing what fox news does to the brain and i can see why trump would appeal to people like you . 
  it is very very interesting how you have 0 capacity of empathy . 
  for you being told a 15 yo is a 15 yo means terrorism apology . 
  exceptional . 
  i hope your condition is not contagious so i 'll stop here . 
  cheers . 
   you are excusing her barbaric beliefs because of her age . 
  yes . 
  like many children that grow up in environments prone to indoctrination , it is perfectly understandable . 
  are you underage so i could excuse your backwards beliefs , terrorism fighter ? 
   just because she is 15 does not man she is not a radical islamist . 
  she could be a pink poney . 
  where 's your proof ? 
  you bitch about terrorism . 
  tell me how is she involved in terrorism . 
  how is my saying `` people calm the fuck down she 's just 15 yo '' helps or does n't in any shape or form the terrorist attacks that might happen in france . 
  c'mon i am curious because you seem like a fighter against terrorism . 
   apologize for radical islamists .
