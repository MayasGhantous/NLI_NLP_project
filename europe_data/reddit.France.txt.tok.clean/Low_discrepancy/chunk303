   the majority share the belief that relations between muslims and westerners are bad . 
  yes . 
  when 40 % of french vote fn you ca n't say people love muslims and we tried our best . 
  when people like you get boners because of terrorist attacks , you got ta think , are people that nice in general . 
  the answer is no . 
  look at your retarded comment that believes hey conflates terrorism and islam . 
   but how much of that was roma ? 
  if check he romanian passport , id or birth certificate you will not find any reference to roma or gypsy or tigan , or rroma . 
  you will only find written : romanian . 
  unlike other countries ( for example in the balkans where ethnicity does appear in documents ) roma is just a self determined ethnicity . 
  you are roma if you choose to define yourself like that at a census . 
  so i would n't know how many are roma . 
   finland can cope with loss of nokia and trade restrictions with russia at least . 
  you 'll make games . 
  that 's kinda cool  you 're vital to eu . 
  the vast majority do not hold her extremist views . 
   is that what you consider to be well integrated ?

  we still have shithead racists in france and that does n't help . 
   people have an issue with muslims not assimilating for decades now , also lets not talk about romanian and bulgarian criminality . 
  but then again , i wo n't complain . 
  cheap hot hookers . . hallelujah . 
   `` 58 % of french muslims view relations with westerners as bad '' , yeah . 
  because a lot of people are like you . 
  shitting on muslims . 
   oh wait ... www.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/11/15/bataclan-theater-shots-ring-out-orig-vstan.cnn nu zis asta des but esti un timpit . 
   yeah , because airports and subways being blown up are not a threat at all . 
  i mean nazis were a far more dangerous threat to france . 
  the far right group oas was a far more dangerous threat to france since they shot at de gaulle and almost killed him . 
  so you were saying ? 
  http://www.pewresearch.org/2006/08/17/the-frenchmuslim-connection/ here ya go brother , read up . 
  coming from a country were the republican nominee thinks women that undergo abortion should be fined and that mexicans send in rapists and drug dealers ... you sure have guts   as french non-muslims . 
  sure . 
  they have the same views as conservative christians in france . 
  they are in no way special . 
  you can present a balanced view , is that wrong . 
  we can all agree that neo nazis do not pose a significant threat to us , so why should radical muslims ? 
  http://www.pewresearch.org/2006/08/17/the-frenchmuslim-connection/ here ya go . 
   the point is she does n't live fully indoctrinated , she stated she has school issues that conflict with her ideology :d fuck me . 
  have you heard of jenny mccarthy ? 
  of antivaxxers ? 
  they generally are well off , well educated people . 
  they send their kids to school , yer believe vaccines will cause them some kind of shit diseases . 
  if she goes to school , she already has learned to criticize and question things , the issue is not her because every kid can easily criticise the beliefs of their parents . 
  dude ** have some critical thinking ** . 
  you claim you display it . 
  well fucking use it . 
  she is a 15 yo , she does n't have the capacities to lead an independent life . 
  you are asking something that not a fuck ton of 15 yo can do . 
  yesterday we had a piece of news about 3 million romanians signing a petition against gay marriage . 
  are they all shitheads that will destroy the world ? 
  no , they simply have a reduced view . 
  this thread is being pathetic . 
  in no shape or form are her beliefs followed by a majority of muslims in france . 
  and in no shape or form are religious muslims different than religious xtians . 
   yeah , jesus camp/white nationalist types constitute a minority of christians , & nbsp ;  this girl 's attitudes are mainstream sunni islam . 
  the vast majority of sunnis in france are well integrated and do not share her beliefs at all . 
  but hey fox news . 
   we do n't identify them as romanian other than their citizenship . 
  and you get amazed that a part refuses to integrate . 
  you send a ton to bug and your neo nazis get proud of it ( yeah it 's a chant about how antonescu should have sent more ) and by miracle you refuse to understand why they dislike their situation . 
  lets not pretend that roma discrimination is not a huge huge issue in romania . 
  because the finnish economy is really doing well . 
   it 's about her family or whoever is poisoning her mind with this bs . 
  well then show me those people . 
  and then show me some neo nazis to have a fair view . 
  a tough stance can not be achieved since a lot of french also oppose deportations . 
  unlike romania that forgot its jewish and gypsy deportations because communism , france did not . 
  and before you complain , tell me how many iasi progrom memorials are there and when did they get installed . 
  thanks . 
   thousands of adults way past the point she has reached . 
  go make vids of them then . 
  also lets make videos of neo nazis and complain how the world is turning to shit, 
  gypsies have been living in romania for 500 years . 
  i think it 's safe to say that they 're romanian . 
  do n't let the racism flow through you, 
   she clearly has a picture of the countries a 15 yo ? 
  really ? 
  fuck that man . 
  watch [ jesus camp ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486358/ ) , watch louis and the nazis to see the prusian blue twins , watch documentaries about westboro church . 
  ** no ** 15 yo that lives in an indoctrinated systems knows what 's what . 
   where do you think she gets her ideas from ? 
  show me then . 
  not a 15 yo . 
   most likely are her parents . 
  well then show me her parents . 
  not low hanging fruit . 
   you seem fixated on that particular timeframe because that 's the data i have with fast googling . 
  i 'll let you go more into detail . 
   may be the result of bias . 
  the racist card . 
  i forgot about that . 
  * facepalm * . 
   so how many were convicted ? 
  a ton did get expulsed . 
  13k in 2014 . 
  because they were probably good citizens . 
  because it 's a 15 yo . 
  she has no sense of her identity , no real experience of life . 
  and is just propagating the bs she saw probably in her family or on the internet .
