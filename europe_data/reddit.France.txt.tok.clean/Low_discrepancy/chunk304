  honesly this is a stupid thread . 
  again ** it 's a fucking 15 yo ** . 
   get the fuck out if you do n't like it then . 
   it is appalling are you 15 yo ? 
  who here was n't a shit at 15 ? 
  are you appaled that she does n't know how every country on this world works at 15 yo ? 
  can someone explain to my while these bs things get upvoted ? 
  a pretty girl that suicides , some 15 yo that has some bs opinions ? 
  really ? 
  how is this relevant ? 
   a subtitle in your link says : did you bother reading my comment ? 
   that means about 13 % ** get accused ** of crimes . 
  mise en cause = get accused . 
  did you skip your french classes ? 
  yeah . 
  ** but the fact still remains : 9300 ** romanians were ** accused ** of crimes . 
   ( there 's also the minor fact that the wikipedia link lists 74,661 romanians in france , not 71,000 as you posted ) fine . 
  ** 10 % ** of romanians were accused of crimes in france . 
  i find it amazing how you dodge the question . 
  it 's a ** huge ** number . 
   neither your article nor mine contain that phrase . 
  the source of my previous article . 
  i wonder how they manage to do all that , those ambitious enfants . 
  the chiildren engage in aggressive panhadling and in pickpotting or theft . 
  that 's not hard to imagine . 
  i never had that problem yet female friends of mine did . 
  i wonder why ... and the older ones would engage in more serious criminality . 
  between 2009-2011 * 70 % increase of criminality of romanians * 100 % increase of criminality where the perps are minors . 
   still less than 1 % of the total prison population 13 % of romanians were accused of a crime in france in 2010 . 
  [ see my previous comment from sources ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4khecc/crime_rates_in_romania_at_a_7year_low_murders/d3f43lc ) do you not think it is a big number ? 
  well fine we can take other numbers : in 2010 , 9300 romanians were accused of crimes in france . 
  http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/la-delinquance-etrangere-en-france-a-l-epreuve-des-chiffres_1082782.html there are about [ 71000 romanians in france ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/diaspora_rom\u00e2n\u0103 ) that means about 13 % get accused of crimes . 
  do you like those numbers . 
  that 's huge , do n't you think . 
   roma children ... open your passport , your id or your birth certificate and show me where it shows your ethnicity . 
   vols et cambriolages it means theft and ** burglaries . 
  ** aka someone breaking in your house to steal your shit . 
  the article says :  grande majorit\u00e9 dans des affaires de vols , d'agressions et d'escroqueries that 's the simple truth . 
  it 's not pickpocketing . 
  we can also talk about your unnatural love for frying and deep frying . 
  even in andalusia . 
  i mean fresh . 
  it 's an area that it super hot , why do people do that ? 
  and the severe lack of cheese diversity . 
  compare that with italian or french cheeses . 
  for a nation that conquered continents that have wonderfully diverse cuisine , for a country that was considered by people that have a diverse cuisine , for a country that is in the region of the world that produces some of the best cuisine in the world , the med region , you simply have to ask yourself why ? 
  why is it so lacking diversity and products . 
  in the romanian passport or id there is no mention of ethnicity . 
   but that seems to be the consensus perspective from the east so uhm ... why do romanian doctors leave en mass for western europe ? 
  why did romania get 3m signatures to put ban gay marriage in the constitution ? 
  how about if you want to work at a world class plane constructor ? 
  would you go to iar or to airbus ? 
  but hey that 's not fair . 
  the west is richer than the east so not cool to compare . 
  let 's look at what romania produces . 
  hmm . 
  cars . 
  yeah you had an independent car manufacturer . 
  look at thisbeautiful [ dacia 1300 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/renault_12#/media/file%3ar12tl.jpg ) . 
  surethe design is dated . 
  from the 60s and romania built them until what ? 
  but hey , it 's romanian . 
  screw the haters . 
  i just linked a photo of a renault 12 . 
  without renault buying you , you 'd still produce cars the french designed almost 60 years ago . 
  this nationalistic bs is annoying and for the feeble minded . 
  credit where credit is due . 
  romania does an excellent job at high level corruption . 
  really an exceptional work thatevery country should envy . 
  but in the case of regular crime , regular corruption , organised crime things are severely lacking . 
  how many well known gangs still operate with no issues outside of romanian 's borders . 
  between 2009-2011 romanian criminality increased by 76 % . 
  underage criminality increased by 100 % , pimping is also very high . 
  human trafficking . 
  let 's help / u/ecalc with some numbers on itinerant criminals http://m.dhnet.be/actu/faits/28-de-la-criminalite-itinerante-est-roumaine-51b7796be4b0de6db97d6d7c in france 28 % of itinerant crime is done by romanians . 
  almost 1 in 3 . 
  dude no need to be testy . 
  it 's true that organised crime has moved to europe . 
  why steal 20 leis when you can steal 20 euros ? 
   not burglars or robbers . 
  you must be a dreamer  http://m.20minutes.fr/societe/989907-20120823-delinquance-roumaine-il-agit-reseaux-mafieux-tres-bien-structures organised criminality is super high . 
  those romanian hookers we see , they 're not independent workers . 
  they have a pimp . 
  20000 cases of burglaries in 2011 . 
  because you think that peasants from villages are actually kind and accepting and would be happy to see gay couples holding hands . 
  but their minds are simply distorted by the priests ? 
  dude be serious . 
  get a friend of same sex as you and go walk hand in hand in a village where you have some relatives . 
  see how long that image will follow you . 
  stop pretending romanians are open to diversity but are simply fooled by the authority . 
  yes but we saw what happened in the 90s too . 
  the hate is still there . 
  i really hope croatians will no longer do disgusting things . 
  reading the disgusting acts , crimes , rapes that the ustase did you have to think ... wow . 
  those were some really depraved beings that had no moral fiver and no logic whatsoever . 
  fucking animals they were . 
  they 'd have special knives to hack people . 
  what kind of people do that ? 
  it 's vile . 
  dude , you were the isis of the balkans .
