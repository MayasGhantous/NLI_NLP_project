  i hope you will never do that again . 
  i really hope there will be peace . 
  i really hope that , 
  he 's the one spewing hate  . 
  he should calm down and seek psychological help . 
  he is severely damaged . 
  he almost died but other people ** did ** die . 
  amongst them and people of every ethnicity and color . 
  so him saying that ** muslims were celebrating in the street that day and he saw it ** is incredibly fucked up . 
  he really has problems since he invents things and is severely dillusional . 
  i feel sorry for him . 
   i sincerely hope that too many people dont die ... aww . 
  thank you . 
  and i hope too that not too many serbians will be killed by croatians . 
  i hope we wo n't see many more disgusting and despicable crimes like those committed by the croatian ustase . 
  really i hope for peace in your region , 
  if it helps , those grease munchers tend to very cheerful and know how to party while the others tend to be a bit stuck up about their traditions and cuisine . 
  and have a very impressive history . 
  dude it 's reality . 
  a lot of med countries have amazing cuisine . 
  churros ? 
  really ? 
  you ca n't compete with french or italian cuisine . 
  heck , not even with greek . 
  no need to be offended . 
  marriage brings a lot of advantages : tax deductions , recognition for the children , etc etc. 
  i think you 're in the wrong century buddy . 
  70 % declare they would n't want to have a gay family member . 
  45 % that they would n't want to work with one . 
  here 's your a lot . 
   most people who signed that probably did n't even know what they were signing . 
  that 's kinda bullshit . 
  look at how many gay pride parades get followed by noua dreapta far left parades . 
  a lot of people simply are homophobic that 's the reality . 
   i think he was going to warn her if she was muslim . 
  god that guy is a shitstain . 
   when the cops went in after the attack , they shut down , what , 450 mosques ? 
  utterly false . 
  the vast vast majority were prayer centers not mosques . 
  but hey the guy is a walking turd . 
  your quote completely misses the ** muslims were dancing ** part that is in the interview . 
  the guy is obviously damaged . 
  he should seek psychological care and not sing at concerts . 
  cuisine wise though there is little connection between the two . 
  one is a greasy mess , the other is delicious , fresh , natural . 
   nations are they nations or just countries ? 
   were you there ? 
  how do you know ? 
  i used to live 100m from the bataclan . 
  i have friends and neighbours there . 
  so yeah . 
  i know . 
  where you fucking there ? 
  he should present proof instead of spewing hateful bs . 
   did you even read the interview or just the two lines that offend you so much ? 
  that part was concentrated stupidity . 
  other parts are diluted stupidity . 
  but stupidity nonetheless . 
  well it 's the truth . 
  you could though say belgium since bruxelles is also french speaking . 
  yeah that is legit . 
  it fell down in 1902 and rebuilt in 1912, 
  come to think of it yeah seems fake . 
  but the rubbles are pretty awesome . 
  wallonia . 
   yes hating nazis is bigotry . 
  again bigotry has a precise definition : prejudice . 
  if someone says he or she is a nazi , then that 's not bigotry on your part to hate them because nazi is an ideology that demands racial purity and other bullshit . 
  if someone is a muslim you can not automatically assume they bad or evil or homophobes . 
  if someone says she is a homophone you can automatically assume the person hates homosexuals . 
  there is ** no prejudice ** on my part to assume that a nazi is a hateful despicable person . 
  the ** is prejudice ** to assume that all muslims are terrorists and they dance around when there 's a terrorist attack . 
  see the difference ? 
  prejudice vs not prejudice . 
  we can see what happens to an unhealthy mind . 
  i think the [ san marco campanile crumbling is the best old timer pic of venice . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/crollo1.jpg ), 
   yes it does . 
  you hate him because of his ideology lol wut ? 
  so if i hate the nazis and the stalinists , that means i 'm a bigot ? 
  that makes sense to you , right ? 
  that type of logic . 
  being a bigot means prejudice . 
  i do n't prejudice when i hear a nazi talking . 
  i know he wants to kill all jews . 
  that 's their thing . 
  i know that guy 's a bigot because read his friggin interview . 
   muslims are the most right wing group on the planet do you generalise much ? 
   and he insults the creepy masochists he 's a ** shithead ** . 
  an utter unbelievable shithead . 
  listen to what he said :  i saw muslims celebrating in the street during the attack no fucking anybody was celebrating shit . 
  he can go fuck himself , fucking idiot . 
  he did n't see shit . 
   they need to be insulted daily , until they face reality , so you 're not a bigot because ? 
  hating a bigot does n't make you a bigot . 
  i do n't hate people because of what religion they believe or what color their skin is . 
   ** if ** i had bought well you did n't . 
  no money lost here . 
  you ca n't return a ticket or anything * cuz you did n't buy any * . 
  so again repeat after me ** our money , our choice ** .
