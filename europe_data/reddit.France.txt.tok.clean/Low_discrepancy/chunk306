  capitalism 's a bitch ai n't it ? 
  you obviously never been to rock en seine to see how the public is . 
   what ? 
  festival goers are narrow minded bigots ? 
  so not wanting an idiot to perform because he made dumbass remarks that insult a ton of people is `` bigotism '' . 
  i do n't think you know what that word means . 
  also can you repeat after me ** our money , our choice ** . 
  now we 're at the stage where we pretend that nothing will happen and everything will be ok is uk leaves . 
  canada gets it . 
  maybe he realised the ship has sailed and he is doing damage control . 
  they ought to cut him some slack . 
  this is just pathetic . 
  i really doubt the french public that goes to these types of concerts would agree with his views . 
  since more french died ... sorry no slack . 
  people that go to rock en seine tend to be more forward thinking . 
  i know crazy ... 
   say homosexuals need to have their dicks cut off and nobody bats an eye . 
  that 's ** bullshit ** . 
  a rapper black m was called to make a performance at the verdun centenary . 
  but because of his shitarted comments against gay and kuffars he was let go . 
  now he 's playing the racism card . 
  just like you play this card . 
  suez crasis was small fries compared to half of europe . 
  when france uk and israel started messing up the region the quickly got told what to do . 
  you think uk did something so massive without us knowing ? 
   i 've had quite bad experience pretty much anytime i had to talk with british physicians . 
  do they call you trash and stuff like that ? 
  or do they seem superior . 
  because those things are similar . 
  not even by a long shot . 
  ah yes . 
  much important , great value . 
  the guy never even visited hungary . 
  why do they both ( and especially her ) have a face that says `` this is my life now '' . 
   london might as well be a different country nonsense . 
  i 've been to london and i must say i love uk . 
  yeah but still 16 is high man for a lot of europe . 
  / r/nambla / s please do n't put me on a list guys . 
   what a devastating news to see a young person like dagmara gone , prematurely and undeservedly darn , i 'm about to make you [ depressed ] ( http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/les-news/actu/detail/article/polytechnique-deux-eleves-se-donnent-la-mort-a-a-quelques-jours-d-intervalle-19451/ ) but [ it happens ] ( http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/societe/article/en-roumanie-le-malaise-des-etudiants-francais-en-medecine-683941 ) all the friggin [ time ] ( http://www.dna.fr/actualite/2016/03/09/suicide-d-un-eleve-de-l-ecole-militaire-de-saint-cyr-coetquidan-l-enquete-requalifiee-en-provocation-au-suicide ) . 
   in our society , boys are supposed to prepare for this sad truth . 
  men should n't cry . 
  or do n't be a minger . 
  [ source : ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4k7s0g/polish_girl_who_complained_of_classroom_racism/d3czmif ), 
   it 's like a nice face is an even better marketing ploy than a dead child face-down in the sand . 
  we should have a subreddit that matches attractiveness to the sort of gruesome death needed to achieve national paper appearance . 
  mine would be `` lone engineer only casualty of the failed first launch of ariane 6 . 
  the failure was caused by another coding error ... produced by the same engineer '' . 
  i do n't work even work as an engineer not at arianespace but i write shitty code . 
  i 'm sure a death like that would get my face plastered on one or two papers . 
   without the help of the united states during the cold war , poland and hungary would not be free . 
  kindly forgetting [ why they were under communist rule from the get go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percentages_agreement ) and it 's obvious us opposed the ussr because they wanted to free hungary and poland . 
  that what the cold war was all about . 
  they are enabling such a system . 
  and most definitely they are financing the nk regime with fresh foreign money . 
   because it 's not stopping people to kill , rape or steal things ... 
  here 's the thing . 
  they sometimes do catch those people . 
   but for exemple , it make it easier to prosecute people who are making racist comment on internet . 
  yeah it will totally stop / u/niqtamer from being a racist asshole on reddit and youtube . 
  a law that bans racism ? 
  why did n't we try that before ... 
   all you need to do is drag a child from the street into a van , and they disappear forever . 
  taken was n't a documentary , you know . 
  the majority of cases do n't happen like that . 
  it 's like / u/caffeinatedt said . 
  it 's mostly poor/destitute families on the fringe of society that sell their kids . 
  there is n't some mega wide european child stealing ring . 
   with the prevalence of destitute foreigners parading through anatolia and the mediterranean and no browns are stealing kids . 
  they 're more likely to sell theirs probably . 
  but hey : fear amirite ? 
  wtf poland ? 
   i know this a political event and not a football match i know you 're sarcastic , but they do n't have much going for them man . 
   i wonder why french government is so in a hurry to fight internet racism omg . 
  yeah man . 
  a twitter hashtag and a ridiculous campaign will fight racism . 
  get real dude, 
  i am simply stating that internet comments are hardly relevant . 
  it 's like reading youtube comments to find out how a society is ( `` if they write that , they must be thinking it deep down '' ), 
  isolationism . 
  i mean lets go the whole way man . 
   i 'm sure the greeks and frenchs are feeling very smart right now , with the left and ultra-left party you have ** no idea ** what you 're talking about . 
  so poland wants to leave the eu ? 
  darn not bad . 
  yeah they do it on versailles . 
   `` babtou fragile '' yeah cuz we never see people being called bougnoule . 
   oh and most of the graffiti is done by the same group . 
  not graffiti . 
  yeah . 
  im sure braun had plans for space walking ... 
  a few regions in romania remain unspoilt ( which is pretty amazing considering 50 years of communism ) . 
  i fail to understand why having droves of tourists messing everything up is a desirable thing . 
  those tourists will be interested in nature etc since urban tourism is shit in romania . 
  so why invade the few regions that are actually awesome like the danube delta . 
  because having droves of tourists fucking up the landscape and throwing snicker wrappers at pelicans in the danube is a desirable thing . 
  you people also say belgium is a real country . / s, 
  vlc just cuz one of my alma maters . 
  not a jet though . 
  things are wrong . 
  but europe and france has been through worse . 
  i know it 's weird .
