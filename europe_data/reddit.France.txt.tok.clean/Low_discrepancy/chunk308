  there would be restaurants with menus not in spanish . 
  again . 
  let 's take the law . 
  the official languages in that area are spanish and catalan . 
  so if you speak one or the other you should be fine . 
  if catalonia becomes independent will you still force everybody to show stuff in both catalan and spanish ? 
   i just ca n't see why it is suddenly problematic if a law in catalonia enforces labelling in both its official languages . 
  because it 's just nationalist circlejerking since the law only forces catalan . 
  that 's `` the course capitalism would run '' . 
  * facepalm * . 
  capitalism works when things have equal ** laws ** . 
  in this case spanish and catalan have equal ** legal status ** . 
  while english or fucking polish has ** no legal status ** in spain or catalonia . 
   it is certainly a hassle . 
  yes a stupid hassle since almost every catalonian understands spanish . 
  ** and it 's a friggin logo ** . 
  again your examples include ** foreign ** languages . 
  spanish not being one in catalonia . 
  it is another official language . 
  there are also ** very few ** catalonians that do n't speak spanish so the point is a bit moot . 
  it seems like a hassle to translate ** everything ** . 
  in this case it is n't a health warning but a logo , it seems . 
  they are not vital . 
  while in france you have to translate english * mottos * that 's normal since english is a * foreign * language . 
  but spanish is n't . 
   are in hebrew . 
  are you saying hebrew speakers are just as often as spanish speakers in catalonia ? 
  and they have the same legal status ? 
   i ca n't see why the catalan government ca n't require that for both languages since both are official . 
  so , for the sake of simplicity one could choose to use just one language sometimes , right ? 
  it just makes sense , does n't it ? 
  also  but replacing the three-metre spanish logo at one of his shops with one in catalan could cost him $ 18,000 . 
  it 's a logo for crying out loud . 
  how many catalan monolinguals do you have ? 
  shit happens . 
  if no agreement is reached of course . 
  heck even in the eu , i expect us to treat uk citizens like any other non eu meaning : stay in line to get a residence permit . 
  okay i am looking for sources . 
  like in france we have the french academy that states what is correct and incorrect french . 
  thanks . 
   while the directive does allow eu citizens to be expelled due to unemployment and poverty , this is subject to tight substantive constraints , procedural rights for the persons concerned , and a case-by-case analysis . 
  unemployment does not mean poverty . 
  that being the reason why no french or spaniard has ever been expelled from the uk on unemployment . 
  but that will become the norm after uk leaves the eu . 
  so yeah it is a ** significant factor ** and the article stands . 
  humans are beautiful creatures . 
  they 'll try to extract meaning from everything . 
  i believe it to be correct . 
   france is different to the uk so should n't be used as an example of what might happen in the uk . 
  in this cas they work the same . 
   as stated in a different reply , uk law very rarely applies retrospectively . 
  it 's not abut applying retrospectively . 
  it 's about applying ** current law ** . 
  no longer part of the eu ? 
  then eu laws do n't apply to you . 
   eu citizens can already be deported if they do n't find work citation needed . 
   it 's likely eu citizens will keep their current rights whilst they remain in the uk . 
  so if someone loses their job the current rules will likely apply ; they 'll have time to find a new job before being deported , no different to the current system . 
  ** citation needed ** . 
  out a friggin link after making big statements ... http://www.biduk.org/sites/default/files/bid%20factsheet%206%20deportation%20appeals%20deportation%20of%20eu%20nationals_pdf%20version_0.pdf it seems that only eu citizens that pose a security issue ( read offenders ) can be deported . 
  if you had n't had a job in x years you can not be deported . 
  there should have been a comma not a full stop . 
  yes for the first , no for the second . 
  implicitly the eurovision is the former . 
  exactly . 
   looked at teh french language protections lately ? 
  if a shop in bretagne has only breton writing why should i care ? 
  more power to then . 
  till furthe rnotice spanish and catalan have equal footing over there so you ca n't really find comparable examples . 
  why not let capitalism run its course . 
  no like , no buy . 
   now broadcasting in usa why is that so amazing about that in the age of internet ( that came after the age of hundreds of channels cable tv ) ? 
  i think europe 's most popular event is the champions league final . 
  eurovision apparently have 200m viewers . 
  the later 360m, 
  the english seems spot on for the eurovision . 
  you seem to miss the point that while genetics ca n't be influenced atm , nutrition and education can . 
   if you 're here before brexit then you have a legitimate right to be here . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  your right to be in france is based on the diplomatic agreements that exist between our countries ( in this case through the intermediary of the eu ) . 
  once those diplomatic agreements cease to exists , all rights offered through them also cease to exist and new ones have to be made . 
  if uk will treat eu countries like it treats any foreign country , i have ** no ** reason to believe that right will be extended . 
   if you 've just finished your studies , you 'll have all kinds of documents showing you were legally here on a degree , so establishing your right is easy . 
  no because you normally go from a student residency to a worker one . 
  your situation changes therefor if you do not find any reasonable employment before your student residency expires , you shall become an illegal because * the agreements that would have prevented your entering into illegality * ( namely the country of the student being in the eu ) will ** no longer exist ** . 
  the rights of eu citizens ** will default ** to the rights of any foreign national unless uk+eu sign quickly agreements ( which lets face it , wo n't happen in the span of ** 4 months ** according to uk law ) . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/02/get-a-job-or-get-out-the-tough-reality-for-international-students  all easy proof that he has a right to be here . 
  for how long ? 
  that is the main issue here . 
  ** in conclusion ** : yes things will change and yes a chunk of people ( unemployed looking for jobs , students that have finished their studies ) will have to look quickly for employment or they will face deportation . 
  it is ridiculous to claim otherwise . 
  but that 's okay . 
  the eu can also play ball . 
   you need to be convinced that was `` really on the table '' . 
  i 'd like definite proof that von cooltits himself was actually willing to carry out that plan . 
   yes , there is a whole book about it and it was called sippenhaft for high ranking army men the punishment was imprisonment of the family : like it happened when koningsberg surrendered or like we 've talked about in the case of paulus . 
  the death penalties you mention were ... after the assassination plot against hitler failed . 
  the fact that nothing happened after he did n't flip the switch against parisian landmarks is proof enough that nothing would have happened . 
  it was the end of the war man . 
   oh it really was and it 's actually quite well documented .
