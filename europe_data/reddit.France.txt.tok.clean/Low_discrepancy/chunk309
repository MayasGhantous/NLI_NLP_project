  i mean really in the table . 
  like something that would actually happen . 
  and the guy needed convincing cuz he was like soooo close to flip the switch and blow the louvre . 
  doubt that ever was the case . 
   as hitler ordered for all officers who refused to obey him . 
  do you have any exemples ? 
  paulus ' wife did n't get shot for example , she died in 49 . 
  hess ' family did n't get shot though his leaving really infuriated hitler . 
  if this were stalin , yes i 'd give that theory some backing , but it 's not the case here . 
   hitler was completely insane at the end and many of his collaborators realised it , no doubt about that . 
  but the old army guard was n't one of the collaborators . 
  choltitz was part of that old army guard , having served in ww1 also . 
  i really doubt the destruction of important parisian landmarks was ever on the table . 
  not to mention that a destruction the the level of warsaw or dresden was ** never ** on the table since it would have been impossible without massive aerial bombardment . 
  and the nazis had bigger fish to fry . 
  it was the allies that heavily bombarded france . 
  i doubt the destruction of important landmarks would have ever happened either way . 
  by the end of the war hitler was hardly popular in the wehrmacht . 
  his orders started getting ignored : see paulus who was ordered to never surrender and to kill himself . 
  paulus just yeah no and surrendered and did n't kill himself . 
   tory mp jacob rees-mogg added that it was `` really grubby politics '' to worry people who had ** established `` a legitimate right to be here '' ** emphasis mine . 
  this means if you 're a spaniard that has just finished your studies in june and got your degree , you 'd have about several months to find a job , if not bye bye . 
  if you 're a frenchman between jobs , better be fast with finding your new job or else bye bye . 
  also ** every ** foreign citizen from the eu should go and get his residency permit that will be issued for you ( so new paper work etc etc ) . 
  but that 's a-ok . 
  i highly expect to treat brits in france and the eu the same way . 
  meaning all brits should immediately go and get residency papers that before they did n't need bug now they do . 
  ** that ** makes sense to me because we have no deals since you 'll just be leaving . 
  can i haz sum context plz ? 
   neither are things you want from politicians . 
  i also do n't want politicians that are proud of whatever religious beliefs they have . 
  but hey , what can we do ( well i generally do n't vote for them , like i 'll never vote for sarkozy ) . 
  is there any context ? 
  because jimmy carr made fun of the holocaust and joked about raping kids and women . 
  ( see no context it 's awful ) . 
   i know already that almost nobody in the nordic countries would vote for their own country , so there would be a clear disadvantage . 
  they already vote for their next kin , so that would hardly make a difference . 
  nope they got 360 points . 
  ukraine 330 . 
  i do n't know whether to be salty or suicidal after this eurovision and its winner . 
  * no more jury voting * no more * not voting for your country * * implement * one vote per phone number *, 
   you know that the juries still had their say previously , right ? 
  you got ta fix these issues . 
  the jury giving 7 the public 222 . 
  you got ta fix brigadeering . 
  and the fact that the jury seems completely out of touch . 
  you got ta do some sort of smoothing out . 
  ** improvements ** : * honestly i 'd remove the retarded * do n't vote for your country rule * . 
  fuck it . 
  if every country votes for themselves , then so be it . 
  i do n't give a shit . 
  everybody will have +12 so it evens out . 
  * 1 vote per person/phone number . 
  if retarded people wan na vote for their country then so be it . 
  brigadering would be reduced because of that . 
  and you 'd be left with immigrants that will vote for their country ( always happens ) and people who actually give a shit . 
  * remove calling each country one by one . 
  it 's pointless because the jumps are too high . 
  ** nobody ** wants to listen to the * omg you made an amazing show , wow it was so amazing , congratulations < organising_country  *, 
   that new voting system is pretty interesting is that british speak for `` retarded '' ? 
  because i 'd agree with you . 
  it gave me cancer . 
  poland : jury 7 , public 222 . 
  not to mention the huge jumps . 
  ianal though . 
  it 's shit . 
  so utter shit . 
  poland got ** 7 ** from the juries and ** 222 ** from the public . 
  what is this shit ? 
  apparently there 's a clog for uk . 
  8 pts from the public . 
  the chick got asked what would it mean for her to win . 
  and she blocked . 
  :d she was probably * meh *, 
  you 're amazing . 
  no you 're amazing . 
  we 're all amazing . 
  his show was impressive though . 
  song was shit . 
  i 'm going austria . 
  it 's because she speaks french . 
  yeah not because she 's smoking . 
  you 'll have to jump backwards to win at them . 
  i hope that water does n't break while she 's walking on it . 
  god people are childish . 
   commodifying water no child slavery ? 
  that eagle is screaming [ to feed it ] ( https://youtu.be/l7skryf8lcu ), 
   the hammer needs to come down hard yes but there will be many hurdles to jump before that happens . 
  very interesting that erdogan separated them in two groups gay right and animal rights . 
  maybe he is warming up to the idea of gays ? 
  germany is taking it like a champ . 
  and esti is about to get teabagged . 
  and denmark is getting bifled . 
  turkology . 
   it made a whole generation dumber and more ignorant , that 's what i meant . 
  check literacy levels before and after communism . 
   the abuses we were subjected to are countless and for many many years after the war was over . 
  the abuses were mostly and primarily done by romanians with no input from russians . 
  which is kinda silly since the obstacle was in the lower part . 
  you can see at 9s that only the window broke .
