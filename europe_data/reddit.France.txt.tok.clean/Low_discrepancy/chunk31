  if de gaulle had authoritarian backward thinking fuck me , i guess i do too . 
   google udhr you mean the declaration that is n't actually international law ? 
  awesome . 
   while not a treaty itself not a treaty . 
   in addition , many international lawyers [ 26 ] believe that the declaration forms part of customary international law [ 27 ] and is a powerful tool in applying diplomatic and moral pressure to governments that violate any of its articles . 
  uuu many lawyers . 
  omg awesome . 
  why do n't you call me back when it becomes a treaty . 
  heck the aussies will help you out https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/what-universal-declaration-human-rights  the universal declaration is not a treaty , so it does not directly create legal obligations for countries . 
  well look at that . 
  well the bakraoui dudes were already being searched by the police because they rented the apartment in forest where abdeslam was hiding . 
  his name was in the press since then ( a week ago ) . 
  dude :d shit your comment made me laugh !, 
  hey . 
  do n't judge . 
  it was erasmus jihadium year . 
  we 've all done crazy things in our youth . 
   international law and human rights international law and human rights ? 
  where 's that so i can read it . 
   yes , that makes you very much very similar to a neo-nazi , and invokes similarities with various extremely repressive and authoritarian trends throughout history . 
  uuu . 
  you have convinced me . 
  i see the light . 
  wait no , not really fuck terrorists , they can go rot . 
  we removed citizenships of nazi collaborators we 're removing it from binationals now , in the future i hope we 'll restore equality . 
  can you not insult others , or is that too complicated for you ? 
   i know you thought you would leave me stranded after switching to french sources , but i 'm european , so it 's not going to work . 
  deal with that :d how about uk ? 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/world/europe/britain-broadens-power-to-strip-terrorism-suspects-of-citizenship.html?_r=0  britain has passed legislation that allows the government to strip terrorism suspects of their citizenship ** even if it renders them stateless ** , at least that is in english . 
  : / here 's a few french http://www.slate.fr/story/112291/droit-creer-des-apatrides http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1760211-20160105-decheance-nationalite-si-souhaite-france-pourrait-creer-apatrides surely they 're all wrong . 
  even uk   ready to become what you fought in wwii , hmm ? 
  oh scary words . 
  petain . 
  fear . 
  fear . 
  :d removing the citizenship of terrorists makes you a nazi . 
   sure his electors are totally in favor of an eternal state of emergency !, 
    sure the left wing voters are totally supportive of his actions !!, 
  did you miss the polls i showed you ? 
   he is the most impopular president so i 'm not sure he us currently doing what the people want him to do . 
  ** and his popularity has risen after the state of emergency ** . 
  now it is at his precrisis levels . 
   it is , we ca n't make people apatride it 's impossible to implement . 
  uhm yes it is possible . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/01/04/decheance-de-nationalite-aucun-texte-international-empeche-france-rendre-personne-apatride_n_8911140.html there are a few more . 
   it 's a placebo measure for when the harm us already done . 
  it 's a symbolic measure.you country also has it http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/world/europe/britain-broadens-power-to-strip-terrorism-suspects-of-citizenship.html?_r=0  britain has passed legislation that allows the government to strip terrorism suspects of their citizenship even if it renders them stateless ,  . . you would implement death penalty again if you had direct democracy . 
  does democracy bother you ? 
   you 're having a confrontation with the voices in your head . 
  someone that compares mafia with terrorism and says the gypsy mafia has killed as much are terrorism . 
  brother . 
  gypsy mafia in romania has killed 0 people . 
  frate educatia in romania a lasat studentii in urma . 
  i do n't think you speak french . 
  here 's the part you want :  \u00c9tendre la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de nationalit\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les fran\u00e7ais est donc th\u00e9oriquement possible sans se mettre en retrait des engagements internationaux et par la seule modification du droit interne . 
  i 'll let you google translate it . 
   now we have nothing . 
  neah man . 
  i have a vote in the matter . 
  you do n't . 
  i hear human rights and my mind just beeps out . 
  and heck , look at that , we are free to create stateless people http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/01/04/decheance-de-nationalite-aucun-texte-international-empeche-france-rendre-personne-apatride_n_8911140.html tell me moar about those human rights . 
  it sounds juicy . 
  here in france we do n't even have rule of the law . 
  we 're barbarians . 
   french savaged algeria and therefore their laws are hypocritical and moot . 
  exactly , bringing up the udhr right now is pretty moot . 
   you do n't have a clue . 
  most people do n't , these days . 
  even among demographies such as reddit 's . 
  you seem bothered that france removes citizenship . 
  darn i 'm sorry man , wish i could help . 
  i just have a vote here in france . 
  and i tend to vote with whom agrees to removal of citizenship for terries . 
  i agree with you . 
  i mean some might have family . 
  but if you 're a 27 yo french with algerian roots and try to play the `` muh family is there '' that should n't fly . 
  yeah i 'd rather not have 1500 people that are battle hardened , know how to manipulate arms and make bombs roaming freely through europe . 
  what a joke man . 
  god . 
  well the udhr was heavily promoted ( heck the mother of the udhr if you will ) by someone that was the wife of a guy that sent 100k americans to camps because they had japanese roots . 
  `` but that was 70 years ago / u/low _ discrepancy '' i hear you say , before udhr . 
  yeah , what about gitmo then ? 
  `` do you want france to torture people ? 
  omg you brute '' . 
  uhm no . 
  i 'm simply saying that the udhr is n't the corner stone or a law system . 
  it 's just a series of recommendations . 
  in no way removing citizenship is a moot point for human rights ... heck we alreay do it now . 
  but i do n't see people complaining . 
   not if such desires by the people violate human rights a politician ** should ** respect the law . 
  that 's it . 
  human rights are nice . 
  you know what 's not nice ? 
  [ a huge mass of people rioting because they had enough . 
  ( a couple of firemen were attacked by some `` young people '' . 
  the corsicans then burnt a muslim prayer centre in retaliation ) . 
  the logical maghrebins are for more security measures . 
  i see it around me . 
  it 's the free souls that complain about them .
