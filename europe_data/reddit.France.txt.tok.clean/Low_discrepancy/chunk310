  it 's a train after all . 
  i like how the reporters say he saved people from dying . 
  wtf ? 
   when reality becomes propaganda to a removed kid from the west incepi sa o iei pe aratura . 
  cut the propaganda , people are n't stupid . 
  40 + mentally retarded because of communism . 
  wtf ? 
   the 40 + ones , are seriously emotionally and intellectually retarded god , i 'll stop this convo here , cuz you are spewing way too much propaganda . 
  cheers . 
   nice justification you have there for the occupation of romania do you understand the concept of war ? 
  when you lose a war as badly as romania did , you stfu . 
  i do n't see germany complaining omg we got split how unfair that was.no . 
  they know why the things that happened , happened . 
  if we were talking about poland , sure they got fucked up . 
  but romania ? 
  sorry buddy you lost , you do n't get to choose . 
  france lost and it got the vichy regime . 
  that 's it . 
  case closed . 
  iraq lost and got a pro-us regime ( that is no democracy that iraqi regime , through its abuse of sunnis created isis ) . 
  that 's what happens . 
  romania won ww1 and it got many regions that did n't have romanian majorities like the cadrilater , crisana ( big cities like oradea had hungarian majorities ) , budjak and northern bukovina ( that had ukranian majorities ) . 
  no one is complaining about those , is there ? 
   and the implementation of 50 years of dictatorship . 
  unlike the ottoman empire and its 500 year rule , russia left after 14 years . 
  since 1958 romania became basically independent . 
  all the subsequent communist rule and oppression was done by romanians . 
  so if you want to blame someone you know who to blame . 
   romanian nazi 's did after forcefully taking over power from king michael i what ? 
  you do realise that carol ii was the ruler of romania when antonescu took power right ? 
  romania 's democratic regime was constantly eroded by carol ( and there were n't that many civil protests , just the usual legionary marches ) . 
  once romania became dismantled , carol simply gave his power to antonescu . 
  michael was never involved in any way . 
   how exactly do you think communism was implemented in romania ? 
  sphere of influence . 
  let 's face it . 
  romania did attack russia . 
  but i guess we choose to ignore history . 
   were you purposely lying or did you honestly did n't know ? 
  the second can be fixed , the first , not so much . 
  dude , sorry . 
  i realise you skipped a few history lessons . 
  ** the soviets invaded garble garble garble ** . 
  actually romania was on a losing side of the war . 
  i realise for you history started on the 23rd of august 44 . 
  what happened before ( killing a fuckton of jews , the worst progrom in history was in iasi :13 k jews killed in just 2 days , killing a fuckton of gypsies : does bug ring a bell ? 
  and was given to russia , ** by the allies ** . 
  you should check your history . 
  wow . 
  so the politics will be in the balkans this year ? 
  well i did . 
  for women it 's :  once you go black , you can never come back . 
  they have a good football team . 
  * shrug *, 
   how the fuck do so many people buy into russian propaganda ? 
  is syria a big power ? 
  cuz they fucked up europe . 
   actually invests in our safety safety for what ? 
  romania has this irrational fear of russia . 
  ( i 'll detail later , calm down ) . 
  romanians still think omg what russia wants is a port warm seas and that 's it 's greatest ideal . 
  the ** only ** thing russia wanted that was n't its , was bessarabia . 
  the wanted a multi-ethnic empire in 1772 and a multi-ethnic state in 1940 . 
  but they never expressed interest in anymore . 
  in 1940 , russia could have annexed up to bucharest . 
  in 1945 they could have integrated romania in the ussr . 
  why did n't they do it ? 
  listen to hitler 's conversation . 
  the only normal recording he has . 
  it 's famous . 
  he said he feared that in 1940 the russians would get the oil fields in ploiesti , ** yet ** they never did . 
  they stopped with northern bukovina ( which certain parts did have an ukranian majority ) and bessarabia . 
  stalin stopped there . 
  the oil fields were friggin [ mega-important ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tidal_wave ) and during romania 's communist regime , russia didnt get involved in romania 's politics . 
  apart for maybe a suspected poisoning of dej . 
  but ceausescu was utterly independent from russia and actually downright opposed : see the visit of nixon in 69 , in 68 romania condemned the occupation of czechoslovakia by warsaw countries following the brezhnev doctrine :  when forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism , it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned , but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries . 
  romania did n't get invaded . 
  ** in conclusion ** russia actually could n't care less about romania proper and the is little to no proof that would contradict this . 
  they wanted bessarabia but their interested stopped there . 
  this `` attack '' of romania is just propaganda peddled by nationalists ( like basescu ) that want to obtain political gain . 
   psd might be a corrupt piece of shit political party with authoritarian tendencies , but they never managed to quite grab a hold of power in the way that putin has , why not ? 
  because of the eu . 
  because they were told hey it you can manage your corruption you can get into the eu . 
  there was a goal to achieve , a hope for a better life for people . 
   it was n't just because of people on the outside that they lost , in 2004 they lost fair and square and if the eu had told romania , yeah you guys will never get it . 
  romania was limping to the get in the eu , it did n't fulfil many criteria and romanian politicians were already saying that if romania is n't let in 07 , they 'll start getting closer to russia . 
  you absolutely can not ignore the whole political context and why people were motivated to vore for change . 
   authoritarianism did n't really take a good hold of romania after 1989 and that allowed for change to happen the communist regime was so much more restrictive in romania yet for a long period it still was an oligarchy made by former communist leaders . 
  i have this impression that you think russia is some kind of shithole and you 're surprised as to why when romania would have very easily been the same if for not eu help . 
  i am simply explaining that romania is poorly prepared for a ** real ** crisis . 
  romania wo n't get invaded by russia , that wo n't happen . 
  the real issues are moldova and transnistria and any cyber attack romania might suffer not a friggin invasion by russia . 
  moldova is a failed state and transnistria is armed by russia and little green men . 
  they already fought a war and you ca n't really ignore the full picture , can you ? 
  is romania prepared for any of that ? 
  for maybe a few hundreds of thousands of refugees ? 
   conventional wars from big powers are dead who 's romania 's neighbor ? 
  and who 's moldova 's neighbor ? 
  have fun when that war starts . 
   our ex-president said a long time ago that `` we tried to negotiate with russia for a long time , but they care only about their interests '' .
