  basescu was the most anti russians leader since ceausescu . 
   you have nothing to worry about then nope . 
  what i 'm waiting is for russia to start shit in transnistria . 
  moldova will go down that rabbit hole and romania will suffer . 
  there 's only a bit of luck : it does n't have access to the sea so the break away republic will have problems to get supplies . 
  putin is leading an oligarchy . 
  just like the romania in the 90s and 00s . 
  do you recall the local barons , the total corruption , how people would still vote for the psd and think iliescu is jesus on earth ? 
  and that 's romania , a country that did n't achieve greatness like the ussr , they could n't promise to come back to the good old days . 
  romania might be still even in the same shit if not for the fuckton of people that left ** and push to change from the eu ** . 
  lets recall that both in 2009 and 2014 , psd lost because of romanians abroad . 
  where can russians go and meet new people and get new ideas ? 
  everybody thinks russians are dumbasses that believe putin shills . 
  much like everybody believes romanians are gypsies but that 's another story . 
  maybe you can do the first step and stop believing propaganda . 
  and remember the country is also suuuuper huge . 
  140 million people . 
  [ how wude !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndwqj64upfq ), 
   aggressive marketing and cut price deals saw them grow so uk 3 is french free . 
  got it . 
  good old divide et impera, 
  monaco ? 
  i 'd expect it to be somewhat large actually . 
  a party destination , on the med . 
  nice area . 
   big difference between `` my dog is a nazi , lol '' and waving a flag of a terrorist group . 
  nope . 
  there is n't really . 
   difference between being a terrorist and having fringe political views . 
  waving a flag doesnt make you a terrorist . 
  you know that right ? 
  dumb things happen . 
  i do n't get the outrage . 
  a ton of movies got banned ( life of brian ) for a long time . 
  in uk people that write dumb tweets might get visit from the police . 
  dumb shit happens but i believe we 're blowing it outta proportion . 
  hey cops are pricks . 
  but it 's not some massive conspiracy . 
   and i just type that out , because for a long time i thought myself , that it somehow meant to split up land or nations . 
  well divide et impera in this case involves splitting up germany in its subgroups . 
  this creates rivalry between each group that can be exploited by a larger power . 
  bismarck used this in reverse , trying his best to provoke france in a war . 
  once the war was started , it was easier to see a common larger enemy and easier to connect groups . 
  my comment was an anti-bismarck another example mitterrand was n't exactly thrilled about germany uniting . 
  back in ancient times , divide et impera involved creating frictions between different tribes , wasting more resources in small fights , giving an advantage to larger powers . 
  your criticism is n't exactly valid . 
  also it was just a joke . 
  it was a joke not meant to be taken seriously . 
  indeed . 
  germans love humor . 
   my point was that prayers in such cases can well have a measurable effect . 
  you can simply relax and meditate . 
  no religious experience . 
   incidentally , deep prayer shares many properties of meditation , which has been shown to be effective against some psychiatric problems . 
  prayer is just repeting a script trying to enter some trance . 
  it has no magic thing . 
  you can pray to the spaghetti monster . 
  it 's either placebo or something you can achieve throgh other means . 
   but religious practices ** again ** it is not the ** religious ** part that makes them effective . 
  it is not the saint a vs saint b. 
  it is the ** practice ** which can be achieve without any religious bs . 
  i think you completely missed the point . 
  all the things you mentioned can be achieved though a lot of non-religious means as they do not involve any specific religious activity . 
  ( for example prayer to saint a when youre travelling and to saint b when you have itchy crotch , i dunno . 
  that 's all bs ) . 
  in this case , islam would friggin cure psychiatric problems . 
  that 's massive . 
  if a tough flies an isis flag and puts the video on youtube , i want the police to detain them and ask them some questions . 
  same thing here . 
  the dude might have been a neo-nazi . 
   did indeed have a reason to suspect that he has posted a funny video on youtube if a youth posts a video playing around with the flag of isis would n't you want the police to detain them and question them ? 
  same thing here . 
   detained by police without charges by definition being detained means no charges have been brought to you . 
  the police suspected something and they brought him in . 
  that 's it . 
  if a bunch of youths would play around with the isis flag i 'd want them detained and the police to investigate them , would n't you ? 
  til :p, 
   unless he is a convert , that was probably just some freak-out . 
  you know being converted does n't automatically cure your psychiatric problems right ? 
  if so , that would mean islam ... kinda works and is the only religion that has an actual measurable impact on an individual . 
  aka religion is real and from all the religion islam is the one that is the real one . 
  your point being ? 
  hey i 'm sure people know i 'm the first to bitch about islamic attacks but this is your random crazy drug addled german native . 
  let 's tone down the xenophobia/generalisations/fear mongering/shit slinging down a notch ? 
  crazy idea i know . 
  him needing psychiatric help is waaaaay vastly waaaaay more relevant to the issue than him shouting shit . 
  but hey , i guess it 's too tough to admit when people are full of shit . 
  convince them of what ? 
  that drug addicts with psychiatric issues are dangerous ? 
  did n't people know that, 
  now native germans are immigrants ? 
  is anyone german in your country ? 
  edit : welp i know very little about you germans . 
  but hey i do n't want to mess with your habits which apparently are very different from region to region . 
  extremely different and if i were you i 'd think about consider independence . 
  but hey do n't let me tell you what to do . 
  but sometimes when the marriage is n't happy ... ^ ^ ^ ^ divide ^ ^ ^ ^ et ^ ^ ^ ^ impera . 
  well what 's a german mindset ? 
  was it bismarck 's nationalism , was it the nazi ultra ltra nationalism , is it the current `` yeah let 's not try to draw too much attention to ourselves '' a nation is n't a single brain .
