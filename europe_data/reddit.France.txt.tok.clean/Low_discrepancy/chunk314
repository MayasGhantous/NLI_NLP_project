  you have the same speech putin has . 
  also italy is a democratic country , they do n't friggin need help from any idiot . 
  putin what are you doing on / r/europe ? 
   so much for your right to self determination , truman . 
  the guy that participated in the partition of europe and germany you think was in favour of self determination ? 
  really ? 
  wilson was generally thought to have been an advocate for that . 
  but self determination in our times makes little sense if the constitution of the country does not allow it . 
  a century ago , you had colonial empires and other empires that treated the people who lived on their soil like second class ( austro-hungary , russian empire ) so self-determination made sense . 
  now you have democratic nations where everybody is treated equally . 
  `` self determination is a whim rather than a necessity '' . 
  you 'll have a hard time convincing me south tyroleans are treated like the algerians 80 years ago . 
  because 9/11 + attacks since are religiously motivated ? 
   was not motivated by islamism . 
  but it was orded by one of the biggest pan-arabians out there . 
  because us interference or whatever . 
  it was confusing . 
   for example , the palestinian thing , that was about israeli and palestinians , but not about muslims and islamism , correct ? 
  it is a complicated issue . 
  we had other islamic type attaques in france : for example by the gia that were connected to the situation in algeria . 
  we should n't over symplify the issue . 
  sure in the 60s-80s the main problem was the cold was and terrorism was just another front for some : russia for the plo , the us with israel . 
  the arab world kinda splitting up accordingly : egypt going to the us which results in wars and the assassination of its president sadat by the muslim brotherhood . 
  terrorist attack in mecca in 79 because ksa was starting to follow the evil west . 
  there were a lot of problems brewing in the whole area . 
  and the current islamisation and its problems do stem from the 50s from people like qutd . 
   or did it really get reported as such ? 
  i dunno , but would you trust any news reports from any point in time to convey reality ? 
  but hey at least there will be pop corn to be had . 
   honestly , this ` muslim ' thing in europe is only ` muslim ' since 9/11 . 
  before that it was purely an ethnic/cultural thing ( in the media and politics that is ) . 
  child of the 80s-90s ? 
  did we forget all those plane hijackings ( too many to count but they forced the creation of european swats ) ? 
  lockerbie ? 
  germany making deals and [ freeing those munich terries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lufthansa_flight_615#allegations_of_a_west_german_government_involvement ) so that they 'd be left alone . 
  it made israel pretty darn pissed . 
  ` muslim ' since 9/11 is kinda not accurate ... at all . 
  that 's simply when the us began suffering from muslim terrorism ( and the biggest terrorist strike to be fair ) but europe had issues for a long time . 
  well that should be up to them to decide not some random politician willing to score cheap points . 
   why should german speakers live in italy ? 
  that ... that does n't make much sense . 
  you do n't see why a foreign politicians should n't intervene in the local politics of another country ? 
  really ? 
  because i can make a list that starts with putin and has many great names on it . 
  also check about the troubles . 
   harassment and the like is n't that an issue with the police ? 
  if it happened to you , i 'd suggest calling the appropriate authorities as you were a victim of a scam . 
  be careful though , if the cops you go to do n't offer you an immediate anal probing , they are most likely fakers . 
  yes . 
  the big bad plot from the white male to rule the transportation board . 
  he who controls tfl controls the [ wooooorld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0syvg97mmgc&amp;t=0m21s ) honestly you can put only lesbian pansexual mtf ftm black transexuals . 
  who gives a crap . 
  it 's about buses . 
  that 's where the major discrimination is ? 
  the guy took rosa parks ' example a little too literally . 
  one could ask : is it in the interest of nato to let them join ? 
  either way the point is moot . 
  the us will slowly get out of europe . 
  i hardly think that clinton will stray away from the path designed by obama : focus more on the economy and internal politics and on the pacific . 
  [ meanwhile in spain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/not_what_you_may_think_-_these_are_nazarenos_%28hooded_penitents%29_in_the_holy_week_parade_in_granada_%28img_5519a%29.jpg ), 
   if `` white men '' are 30 % of the population but 90 % of the london transport board , then there 's probably something going on . 
  who gives a flying crap about who 's on that board ? 
  it 's public transportation . 
  you do n't need gender or ethnic roles for it . 
  they do n't measure your penis and how white it is before getting on the bus . 
   positive discrimination . 
  still illegal in uk . 
   thats why voting oh man . 
  to be young again ... 
  i 'm thinking of the poor scratched tables . 
  this is what they celebrate in [ catalonia ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/image/7552kuhdy-50d0/1200/825/6468733.jpg ), 
  so the eu ca n't survive in the long run that 's why you got ta kill it quickly ? 
  so hungary 's main exports are porn , memes and rubik ? 
  those people were made for the internet age . 
  omg . 
  you mean to say it was a nuclear device ? 
  millwall, 
  sometimes you occupy , sometimes you just visit . 
  that 's just italian economics . 
  : o you commented in a thread that does n't deal with brexit ? 
  welcome !, 
  i was kinda worried about that too , then i checked the stats . 
  france is the most visited european country . 
  4 million american citizens . 
  german citizens ? 
  30 million . 
   the 11 old girl is missing . 
    interesting how the media never shows her dead body , torn apart limb from limb just because it does n't fit the narrative . 
  if she was a drowned syrian kid carefully aranged by the photographers , we would n't see the end of it . 
  omg what a caring individual you are :') . 
  i bet you already went to the swedish embassy in prague to put some flowers and a little word for the victims . 
   what a nice , empathic and all around lovable human being you seem to be . 
  i bet you 're also kind to animals . 
  be prepared for a ton of these `` caring '' individuals that will shit on your country because of bullshit reasons or because they wan na rile up people . 
   britain and france shit for libya un mandate . 
   they do . 
  they are a strategic location that russia used for many decades as a buffer between themselves and western europe by taking over romania part of the carpathian mountains . 
  they actually do n't . 
  see how romania 's oddly missing from your map ? 
  romania was actually the first that effectively broke off from the warsaw pact back in 1966 with ceausescu .
