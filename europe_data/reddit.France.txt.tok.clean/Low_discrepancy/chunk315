  in 68 ceausescu condemned the occupation of czechoslovakia and said that any country that crosses the romanian border will be attacked . 
  you know what ** the first ** ee country to be officially visited by a us president ? 
  take a wild guess . 
   why do you think stalin wanted to take over romania after world war 2 ? 
  well romania did cross over and fought with the germans at stalingrad . 
  starting from around 1956 , romania was essentially independent as dej started to follow a more and more independent route . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._bartholomew%27s_day_massacre i mean really we can go on and on . 
   romania is not standing in any way in russia 's path . 
  but if nato gets attacked , finland does n't need to go to war . 
  yeah . 
  and back to the main toppic , there 's reasons why finland is n't in nato . 
   that i have to pay for . 
  you pay for your wifi at home too ... 
  100s of millions suffered from the various christian ideas that were circulating , yet the bible 's still there and not many people say fuck jesus . 
  ideas are ideas . 
  unless someone says : oh kill those people etc , then it should be fine . 
   when 6 months ago most of them where vehemently in the `` the only solution is diplomacy '' camp . 
  well 6 months before that they were in the assad must go , even by force , then isis happened . 
  in reality no one knows what to do with syria and there are no goog plans . 
   but they almost defeated the russians in the winter war it 's basically the other way round . 
   the only reason i do n't use more than 1 gb per month is because i 'm always on wifi at the places i frequently visit ( work & home ) . 
  at the same time , you 'll have wifi at hotels or restaurants . 
  let me just say she did * not * age well . 
   you forgot to say that the last bit is nothing new . 
  there are reasons why finland is n't that willing to join nato . 
   as if these are not just as important as calls and texts now - more so if anything netflix and youtube is more important than email , calls and text ? 
   thanks eu tl ; dr : / r/thankobama  and now telecom operators have started hiking their prices to cover the cost of `` no cost '' roaming . 
  you have shitty telecom companies and you blame the eu ? 
  we did n't have ny price hike in france . 
  you sound like those people that bitch that obama increased their insurance costs when it was their insurance companies that did the increase . 
   snapchat , youtube or netflix when they 're on holidays . '', 
  you do n't need that . 
   gmail if you 're using more that 1gb of gmail per month , something is odd . 
  i do n't even use 1 gb per month as is . 
  even in map intensive environments etc i barely use 500 mbs . 
  just download the map and you 're set . 
  fuck me , we 're a bunch of consumerists . 
   brussels is bilingual . 
  if you call brussels francophone , the flemings will murder you in your sleep . 
  bruxelles is francophone , the ring of small towns around it is flemish . 
   4x larger than the next biggest cities ( manchester and birmingham ) 5x larger than the 4th biggest ( leeds ) 8x larger than the 5th ( glasgow ) yeah population in cities follows a pareto distribution . 
  that 's no surprise there . 
   especially the flemish diamond bruxelles ... what ? 
   fighting climate change that 's negated by the methane from all the bulls needed to produce that much bullshit . 
  eu is the closest we 've ever been to a european identity * in the history of european people * . . 
  your nordic union that you had/have going is not a european identity it is a scandinavian identify . 
  same goes for benelux, 
   however , notice how the ballots are unfolded and unwrinkled . 
  goddamit they did n't use iron staples that would rust !, 
   australia social democracy ? 
  really ? 
  i no filthy socialist menshevik . 
  i glorious bolshevik . 
  did anyone go to / r/russia to see how much they 're in the nile ? 
   putin is in almost direct control of chechnya where is proof ? 
  no proof !, 
  gay propaganda from vest !, 
  you did n't reply to any of my present remarks or comments . 
   is treating it as a german aberration just because it was so big . 
  it would also be ridiculous to claim that france would have had its own holocaust if germany had not won . 
   but the ones rounding up the jews to send them there were the french - which is what we 're all talking about in the first place https://books.google.fr/books?id=ow6pdgaaqbaj&amp;pg=pt158&amp;lpg=pt158&amp;dq=les+juifs+a+partir+de+16ans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l61veeaehb&amp;sig=q7zxvrl7fgk1wpi5uk4sgzzpqz0&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiyypc32zntahwl0ymkht7edbkq6aeihjaa#v=onepage&amp;q=les%20juifs%20a%20partir%20de%2016ans&amp;f=false there was a deal between laval and dannecker . 
  they offered children of foreigner jewish and the french police to gather the jewish in exchange for leaving the french jewish alone . 
   talk about saving the french state at the expense of the nation ... myes . 
  you 're the one to judge . 
   this is how you get people like le pen saying things like she did . 
  i 'm sure you do n't have any neo-nazis or negationists in germany . 
  i am also sure germany removed all nazis from power after ww2 . 
   the schengen area . 
  because the schengen area would be pointless to them . 
  guyane and r\u00e9union are not in schengen . 
   it was also agreed that the french police would only deport non-french jews , so they were protecting french citizens and at the same time sending non-french innocents to death . 
  no shit nazis are bad people . 
  it 's just that it 's not like / u/mainstay17 said that french went above and beyond what german nazis demanded because hey why the fuck not . 
  and it 's not like german nazis were completely oblivious to the fact that they could also kill children . 
  it 's not like the went back to berlin and told himmler omg did you hear this new french invention ? 
  killing children !, 
   anne frank was later , the vel d'hiv was one of the first big round ups anne frank was an example . 
  vel d'hiv was in 42 when the final solution started and when they also started picking up children . 
   for example nazis intended to deport only jews above a certain age https://books.google.fr/books?id=ow6pdgaaqbaj&amp;pg=pt158&amp;lpg=pt158&amp;dq=les+juifs+a+partir+de+16ans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l61veeaehb&amp;sig=q7zxvrl7fgk1wpi5uk4sgzzpqz0&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiyypc32zntahwl0ymkht7edbkq6aeihjaa#v=onepage&amp;q=les%20juifs%20a%20partir%20de%2016ans&amp;f=false seems to me it 's not an obvious point . 
  laval offered jewish children of foreign citizens and having the french police to catch them , instead french jewish would n't be too affected . 
  for christs sake it 's nazis ( on both sides ) . 
  but it 's not like french nazis gave a nudge to german nazis and told them , you know ... you should try and kill kids too and germans going ov korze fritz , vhy didn we zink about that . 
   they officially went for people over 16 . 
  how do you explain anne frank that died at 15 then ? 
  drancy became a transit camp towards extermination camps outside france by 1942 . 
  and auschwitz did n't discriminate based on age . 
   of course , that 's a very intellectually dishonest thing to say omg , people are intellectually dishonest when talking about the war ? 
  : o say it is n't so . 
  should we make a list of all the dishonesty that came after the war ? 
  poles ignored by churchill , nazis still in position of power in germany and france , allies that killed as many french civilians during the war as the germans killed british during the blitz , the us taking scientists and offering comfy positions , the us using former nazis to fight communist in south america , the us sponsoring former fascists in italy against the rising extreme left . 
   quite a lot of french people collaborated and sometimes went above and beyond what the nazis required of them yes french people collaborated , yes they captured and turned in jewish people , yes the acts in occupied france were horrible but what exactly do you define as above and beyond what nazis demanded ? 
  heck , the heads of the drancy camp were germans . 
   de gaulle was particularly important in helping this spread . 
  it was impossible to talk openly about the crimes of vichy in france until the 70s . 
  after the war there was a massive effort of removal of those that collaborated with the germans . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89puration_%c3%a0_la_lib%c3%a9ration_en_france ** 11000 french were executed after the war ** which amounted many times to witch hunts . 
  about 1.8 k seemed to have been without any reason . 
  the war and aftermath left significant scars on french society so of course de gaulle did n't want to bring it up again . 
  germany fought a war and lost . 
  france fought a war , lost , was occupied and fought something that at times amounted to civil war .
