  rome to firenze . 
  not that expensive i remember ... 
  i was buying to leave in the next hour though so maybe that 's a factor . 
  included a little dry snack in a bag and a cup of some refreshment of your choice . 
   we send back all muslims and we send back all europeans who want to send back muslims with them yeah . 
  let 's send back french muslims where they come from ... uhm ... what ? 
   actually many right voter , myself included , could vote le pen in that case . 
  the logic would be that at least since everybody hates le pen she would n't be able to get a majority while m\u00e9lenchon could be supported by the center-left . 
  it 's not just that . 
  le pen wants a clean frexit ref . 
  that means no bs negociations . 
  and polls show people generally want to remain in the eu . 
  also she said she 'll step off if she losses the ref . 
  meanwhile meluche wants to pull a cameron . 
  he wants negociations and ** after ** a frexit ref . 
  that means that if negociations fail ( and they 're designed to fail , he 's asking too much ) he 'll then have the frexit ref and can play the `` see evil europe that doesnt want to change for us ? 
  we have no business being here , we have no power , no voice '' . 
  heck , for someone that really likes the eu , the options seen * very * weird . 
   melenchon is by far the best candidate out of the first 4 . 
  if you want the best way to kill off the eu , yeah . 
   he thinks the financial market is unfair and he wants to regulate it financial markets in france are n't that significant since france is n't a major trading market . 
  usually it 's more m&a et al. 
  markets would be wild because the eu and eurozone would be in danger . 
   also , i 'm betting for a lot of people `` paralyzing government '' is a good option especially if le pen or meluche win . 
  this means eu might not be killed off . 
   from a ux standpoint . 
  frankly libreoffice is just fine for these people . 
  it 's not like they have word macros or whatever . 
  do n't think that 's a law though . 
  actually the ecj stated you can not arrest illegal imigrants simply because they 're illegally in your country . 
  yes !, 
   that 's a pretty extreme stance to take and definitely wo n't help the eu 's image in any way . 
  how about at random , every year you do n't pay the eu and you do n't get any funds . 
  and you make the random draw 1 week in advance . 
   seems the most democratic to me . 
  and indeed it is !, 
   that sounds like a terrible idea . 
  that 's the law . 
   he was from an albanian no wonder he was so violent !, 
   for the general public , as i still bump into rather frustrating bugs and issues from time to time . 
  well the article is about administration that normally also hire it staff . 
  the reason why linux is n't more widely available in these case is because some people flat out refuse to learn new stuff . 
  we all know a secretary or two that has been at her job for 20 odd years and only knows word . 
   linux is in no way innovative . 
  it was conceived as a copy of unix that runs on cheap hardware . 
  ever since , it has focused its energy on implementing `` free '' versions of already-existing commercial software . 
  dude go back to t_d . 
  you 're embarrassing yourself . 
   sorry communists damn communist google and fb and every company that use openssl . 
   the big issue europeans had was that these rules were not very well enforced indeed . 
  but that does n't mean that the rules do n't exist . 
   they should n't be allowed into the general population & nbsp ;  and work in france which is it because you 're contradicting yourself ? 
   france are allowed to freely live well according to the ecj you can not arrest an illegal immigrant simply because they 're do n't have any papers to be in europe . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2011/12/06/la-justice-europeenne-s-oppose-a-l-emprisonnement-des-immigres-clandestins_1613841_3214.html  if 2 million african migrants decided to come across this year would you really offer no resistance ? 
  if they arrive in france ( or the eu actually ) , they 'll have to either be asked to apply for asylum or if not , eventually they 'd get deported . 
  but they wo n't be imprisoned . 
  there 's no push to change it actually . 
  our prisons are already ** beyond ** full as it is too . 
   but they can not have the same freedoms as the rest of us . 
  they do n't . 
  they can not leave the country where they are applying for asylum . 
  and after they 're refused , they can be deported at any time . 
  that does n't seem to me like the same rights . 
   they should n't be allowed into the general population until their application is processed . 
  based on what law ? 
   they are not being arrested , if they want to leave and return to where they are from then that should be arranged . 
  fine detained . 
  based on what law do you want to detain them ? 
   i think after a short while of strictly adhering to this policy according to french law , it is an illegal policy . 
  you sound zesty . 
  good luck with the kurds then , 
   fuck off with your geneva convention bullshit , people with intentions like this deserve no rights and no freedom . 
  what intentions ? 
  are you implying all asylum seekers should be locked up ? 
  i 'm sure people here like / u/xeno87 would agree that radicalised asylum seekers should be sent home . 
  but others ? 
  why lock them up ? 
  based on what rules ? 
   refugees have no right to walk around freely in the territory they arrive in before their application is processed . 
  you want to arrest them based on what law ? 
  why do n't you give the kurds a country and call it a day ? 
  that 's what we did in algeria . 
   made healthcare more accessible . 
  privatized the economy . 
  western media rarely , if ever , mentions his achievements as leader of turkey eh the image of him was kinder a few years back . 
  you ca n't really say : oh he arrested the opposition ... but 10 ago he made some good stuff . 
  yup . 
  italian anarchist killed a french president . 
  sadi carnot never forget !, 
  worst day of my life . 
   comparing catholic/protestant irishmen in the us to muslims from mena in the eu is a gross oversimplification . 
  do you want to me to get some french articles from 1900s that shit on italians ? 
  about how they 're lazy , noisy , violent , later how mussolini was n't sending the best italians but people who committed crimes ? 
  ( that 's no joke btw ) . 
  we also killed a few ... 
  i bothered to check meluche 's program and indeed ** you were wrong ** . 
  https://laec.fr/section/51/plan-a-proposer-une-refondation-democratique-sociale-et-ecologique-des-traites-europeens-par-la-renegociation  en cas d'accord , le r\u00e9sultat des n\u00e9gociations sera soumis \u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum au peuple fran\u00e7ais qui d\u00e9cidera souverainement de sa participation \u00e0 l'union europ\u00e9enne refond\u00e9e ou de la sortie it is meluche ** that defines what succesful negociations are ** since he says * en cas d'accord * . 
  of course he does ** not say what agreement means ** . 
  here 's / u/executivemonkey [ fishing ] ( https://bg0lden.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/gollum-biting-fish.jpg ), 
   before dialing up prices and become more expensive than regular taxies ever were .
