  the day uber raises prices , people will pick up their own car and start doing their own independent uber . 
  see , unlike facebook that has a network that you can not replicate , amazon that has warehouse that you can not replicate , uber has ** nothing ** but an app . 
   uber runs a 2 billion deficit with a 10 billion revenue ( in 2015 ) and stays afloat purely on venture capital . 
  perfect . 
  free money for us . 
  let us take advantage of it . 
    after all , the vc gangs that financed billions of operational losses will want their money back . 
  perfect . 
  we agree . 
  the worst thing you can do to uber is actually use uber . 
   when children in the west die then there 's `` respect for victims '' and other lies . 
  would the parents agree with having the media plaster images of their children run over , mangled etc ? 
  would n't it be more beneficial to have the media show images of their kids when they were alive , happy etc ? 
   do you have a problem with the french people deciding its future ? 
  if we 're to decide our own future we should have a referendum on the death penalty too . 
   i do n't think that 's their only reason to cancel the visit goddamit . 
  why did n't bojo consult with / u/patnau before changing schedules . 
   at the moment every ride is subsidised by uber ( ~ 40 % !!! ) . 
  all that sweet venture capital money so we agree . 
  a very basic microeconomic analysis shows that yeah you 'd be stupid not to pocket those 20 euros . 
  i perform an arbitrage . 
   the more uber i consume , the less money uber will have . 
  and france and germany are making money off the greek debt . 
  hurray !, 
  reddit is full of her fanboys . 
  a 6km taxi ride costs me 33 euros by tax , 13 euros by uber . 
  if wanting to keep 20 euros makes me an ayn rand fanboy then that means i can use that money to buy a kindle version of atlas shrugged and still have enough left for an espresso . 
   let 's stop asking taxi drivers to get licensed , and stop asking the cars to have a medallion . 
  if you suddenly say that taxis no longer will need medallions , you know who 'll riot ? 
  taxi drivers . 
  the state basically gives the medallions for free but they are n't a ton of them . 
  medallions allow you to pick up people that flag you or allow you to stay at airports or stations . 
  it 's the black market taxi drivers buying and selling medallions that made the price super high : 400k in some parts of france for example . 
  if the state tells them no medallions will be necessary these people will start rioting . 
   i can confirm that they are in romania . 
  they are subhumans who assault and insult people , take the scenic routes oh man i 've got a story about that . 
  i was in bucharest and got in a cab . 
  i was tired from my flight and stuff and only after a few km did i notice that he did n't turn on any taximeter . 
  so i start complaining , dude this is bullshit , why did n't you turn it on ? 
  how much will this cost me and he gives me some bullshit amount and i start getting annoyed . 
  and that 's when he tells me : `` are you annoyed because i 'm gypsy ? '', 
  `` no dude , i 'm annoyed because you 're ripping me off '' . 
  dickhead trying to play the race card . 
  f\u00e9nelon . 
   i 'm stunned you made that statement . 
  i 'm now imagining someone gasp in shock at their screen , paralised for an instant then slaming their laptop closed . 
  after pacing nervously through the room for 5 minutes , typing while shaking `` how could you say uber drivers are former taxi drivers ? '', 
  you keep insulting . 
  i 'll keep reporting . 
  you should stay off the internet if you ca n't control your temper , 
  condescending behaviour and cheap attacks are against reddiquette . 
  you should bother getting a proper education then and revise your behaviour . 
  you 're bringing `` civilised behaviour '' in a discussion about lawful actions . 
  i fail to see how it is relevant to the discussion . 
  what 's civilised is to respect the rule of law , by regular people , heads of state or prosecutors . 
  end of discussion . 
   in the cases it would be possible we often do not do it , because we choose to get along with each other in a more civilized way . 
  prosecuting those that commit crimes is not civilised . 
  interesting view on it . 
   they would need to actually violate the law in a given country , and you would still rely on the hungarian government actually extraditing him/her . 
  since hungary is surrounded by the eu except through serbia , that would essentially mean that those people targeted are basically stranded . 
   regardless this is not something for others to be involved in and would set a really bad precedent , we do n't prosecute fillon or sarkozy either even though they 're criminals . 
  so we agree . 
  it 's not a matter of being possible but of matter of wanting to actually do it . 
  it 's sufficient to prosecute those around orban . 
  state corruption like this is n't just orban and the govt . 
  heck probably he 's smart enough to not come close to this and just have henchmen do the dirty work . 
   eu member funds where do eu member funds come from ? 
  also some countries take more than they give . 
  hungary is one of them , 
  why do n't you go back to t_d ? 
   you can prosecute hungarian criminals in different jurisdictions if they commit crimes in different jurisdictions , like you always can , but that 's not what you said . 
  maybe eu funds used the euro . 
  and as such extend the jurisdiction similar to what the us does . 
   those are two different promises , no point in arguing over it so he promised to leave the eu unless he gets everything he wants . 
  we 're back at the beginning . 
  awesome ! . 
  he promised a credit ref if he does n't get everything he asked for . 
  it 's not complicated man . 
   that 's the position he takes for his electorate but i do n't think he 's actually going to push to leave the eu vote for m\u00e9lenchon . 
  he wo n't do what he promised to do !, 
   melenchon is just sceptic of the liberal eu , not really eurosceptic i did n't see any other projects for the eu . 
  his strategy is : give us everything i want or we 'll leave . 
  not exactly how one negociates for a europe with vastly different sensibilities , is it ? 
  i see melenchon complaining about how factories are moving in eastern europe but i see him offering no projects that would raise the standard of living there . 
  eh , i can make popcorn comments and still be fine :p, 
   not supporting strikes is not the same thing as supporting assad using chemical weapons . 
  i hear no alternatives . 
   it 's like watching jacob rees-mogg discover reddit . 
  / u/finndacool gives / u/trucidator the most epic putdowns . 
   thing in question is a speeding ticket that you are currently fighting casier judiciaire should be only for penal condamnations . 
  at least that 's the case for france . 
   he leaves that to the french people to decide via the referendum , that 's in the video you posted . 
  how will he campaign ? 
  i have ** no ** idea what he 'll campaign . 
  he 'd be the president . 
  how will he lean ? 
   a referendum on whether he should accept the results of the negotiations or not , to be clear to anyone reading us , not on france 's membership . 
  a referendum on accepting the results that will result in a ** no ** will mean a frexit referendum and from the momentum of the first vote will mean a ** yes ** on frexit . 
  c'mon man , we 're not stupid .
