   this is speculation and you should phrase it as such . 
  true . 
  melenchon put his finger on the nuclear button ** and we have no idea what will make him not launch the nukes ** . 
  that 's the state we 'd be with melenchon pr\u00e9sident de la france . 
  kinda weird for such an important issue to not know what will make him happy . 
  i saved your comment and will reply in a month to rub it on your face , 
   i feel like le pen will be far less interested . 
  i follow people that have a high chance to win . 
   and even then they have totally different goals and strategies for what to do . 
  yes , one is honest about wanting a frexit referedum , the other has said that if he does n't obtain ** everything ** he wants from the eu , he 'll have a frexit referendum . 
  one is honest about putting only french people first , the other claims to care about all people but his people ( like francois ruffin ) non stop shit on the fact that companies are moving factories in eastern europe and that they should stay in france . 
  ( they also shit on eu and claim to care about the poor but forget to mention how minimum wages doubled in romania and poland since joining the eu ) . 
  edit corrected . 
  hollande wanted to start an intervention with the us after the first chem attacks but obama was n't too cool about it . 
  now hollande is a lame-duck , and while he still says he wants assad to step down . 
  the likeliest to win the elections , macron has said that if there is a un campaign in syria , that france will intervene with boots on the ground . 
  let 's hope . 
  you can see ** all ** the polls give him more than his actual result . 
  and i also named a country . 
   he 's not against the idea of eu , which still appeals to a lot of people , but wants to change what many french people think is wrong in the way it currently works . 
   ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) hon hon hon. 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/640j16/french_presidential_election_tightens/dfyx157/  he wants peace and negociation when the other candidates are leading us to open conflict with russia ... http://europe.jean-luc-melenchon.fr/2015/04/13/les-sanctions-anti-russes-sont-illegales/ you 're on / r/europe . 
  you should tell the ukrainians here that melenchon has said this : article with the title ** anti-russian sanctions are illegal **  la rupture avec la russie est insupportable par l\u2018\u00e9conomie ukrainienne actuelle . 
  tl ; dr : ** sanctions should stop in order to help the ukrainians and their economy ** . 
  see how kind melenchon is ? 
  how thoughtful !, 
  think of the poor ukranians and stop the sanctions . 
  he wants peace and the price will be ukraine . 
  he also polled 17 % in 2012 and got 11 % . 
   do you not mind when your government attacks another country ? 
  if it means that chemical weapons wo n't be used , then no i do not mind and i 'll more happily pay my taxes . 
   he wants to use it as leverage in negotiations , after analysing why tsipras failed . 
  tsipras failed , cameron failed . 
  if melenchon is elected : you can say goodbye to the eu . 
  why ? 
  because he has said that he will negociate to change the eu [ ** and whatever the outcome of the negociations he will ask for a referendum . 
  ** ] ( http://www.europe1.fr/politique/jean-luc-melenchon-sortir-de-leurope-et-de-leuro-ce-sera-tranche-par-le-peuple-francais-3003080 ) let 's say the negociations are fair and he obtains 50 % of what he asked . 
  he 'll have his referendum and since he * only * got 50 % of what he 'll campaign for ** out ** . 
  it 's not polite to lie to our fellow europeans . 
  melenchon : * does ** not ** have a clear statement of what he wants to obtain from the eu * does ** not ** define what successful negociations will be * does ** not ** understand that the result of any negociation need to be ratified by all eu country parliaments since all that melenchon does is define precisely what failure will entail ( frexit ref ) and does ** not ** say what success will be , it is clear that only one thing will happen . 
  has no clear defined perimeter but he has his finger on the nuclear button . 
  say bye bye europe . 
   because my country just started another conflict . 
  are you syrian ? 
   people who wave the eurosceptic card to get votes are terrible leaders , and it is n't sure that they wo n't call a referendum on it . 
  lookin ' at david cameron dude do n't go to / r/france . 
  you 'll see the most dilusional people ever . 
   free baguettes for everyone !, 
   to my great dismay . 
  why would be saddened by the fact that people who used chemical weapons get their just deserts . 
  mattis seems to have taken issue . 
  and trump . 
   it 's only a treaty obligation . 
  it 's a soft promise . 
  sometimes in the future we have to disarm ... sometime ... 
  in the future . 
   france has an obligation to try to dismantle its own nuclear arsenal along with others . 
  that will never happen . 
  how is it relevant to mention poland though ? 
  i never heard of any recent terrorist attacks in morocco for example . 
  or brazil . 
  we can list countries to our heart 's desire . 
  how is it relevant though ? 
   all part of life in a big city of course , nothing to see here . 
  drunkards driving ? 
  yeah it happens sadly . 
  i have no idea . 
  you made the comment . 
  tell me . 
  hmm that one had 300 votes ( 96 % ) . 
  this one has 15 votes ( 86 % ) . 
  there 's a discrepancy and i do n't know why . 
  the vast majority of french know and have muslim friends . 
  some are the nice friends i have . 
  8/10 would recommend muslim again . 
   exposing your country to it i exposing the country to what ? 
   i feel like the chances were a bit higher than let 's say for poland ... 
  so you 'll take orban 's offer and move to hungary . 
  wow . 
  respect man . 
  send back some kurtos . 
   seems like a wise and not too expensive way they 're putting them in nice . 
  it 's expensive , like all public works and kinda ugly too . 
  they static . 
  i shall read the un report when i have some time . 
  see . 
  it 's possible to provide sources . 
   plus you do n't seem to realise what the word negotiate means . 
  yeah you offer something you have . 
  we do n't have anything in syria . 
   damning feature that they are indscriminate . 
  so are nuclear bombs . 
  i still think it 's great france has them . 
   white phosphorous ? 
  is used as an incendiary weapon and not for its toxicity . 
  as such it is still allowed by the un . 
   clusterbombs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_cluster_munitions you 'll notice that neither the us nor ksa signed this convention . 
  nor yemen nor russia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_weapons_convention syria has acceded to this convention . 
   we have no source that was assad using the chemical weapons on 4th of april we shall wait .
