   especially if the consequence of such a measure mutilates the legal landscape of a nation forever . 
   confining people at home without accusing them ... democracy and human rights . 
  yeah yeah . 
  we heard the propaganda . 
  2 years after that declaration 60k french were having their heads detached from their bodies . 
  5 years after 170k french vedeens were massacred in various wars . 
  it 's bullshit . 
   apartheid works , but is it a solution ? 
  ah yes . 
  scary words . 
  add in segregation and muslims ca n't marry white women . 
  that 's what we 'll do . 
  be afraid ... boo ...  firstly , there 's no gypsy terrorism , but there 's gypsy mafia we do have maghrebian mafia but that 's beside the point . 
  how can you even compare mafia with terrorism ? 
   coming from a neighborhood in romania that had it : muta-te in ferentari , ce-mi pasa mie . 
   and i 'm pretty sure the mafia kills more than terrorists in europe . 
  yes i too have an ass i can get stats out off . 
   i know what does n't work ... what does n't work ? 
  ignoring the problem ? 
  * saying oh they 're young , * oh they 're from a different culture , * oh they just love their religion and one should n't criticise religion , * oh israel is bombing after all an apartheid state that segregates the palestinians , this algerian is free to okay to hate them , * no no it 's okay if [ they do n't want to respect a minute of silence in the name of their fellow citizens murdered by cowards ] ( http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/1306128-minute-de-silence-pour-charlie-hebdo-refusee-par-des-eleves-on-est-tous-responsables.html ) * it 's okay if a major rap star said that [ if you play with fire , you 'll get burnt ] ( http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/charlie-hebdo/20150413.obs7120/booba-sur-charlie-quand-on-joue-avec-le-jeu-on-se-brule.html ) about charlie hebdo * the number of cars burnt on ny eve has decreased by 14 % . 
  what a success . 
  [ it 's now at ** 800 burnt cars ** !, 
  ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2016/01/01/97001-20160101filwww00125-nouvel-an-en-france-804-vehicules-incendies-en-baisse-de-145.php ) i can continue with ways the french govt , political class and organisations have let a big part of france rot and drift away from society . 
  ignored and left alone to fester . 
   you are just further proving that he panders to the right wing . 
  if doing what the people ask you to do is pandering then every politician should be a panderer . 
  we 're a democrary not an elightened dictatorship . 
   withdrawal if citizenships is impossible no it is not . 
  there is simply no * political will * to do it . 
  legally we could do it without any problems . 
  either way the senate voted a law to make it legal to withdraw for binationals . 
  heck i 'm a binational and i support that law . 
   i really do n't understand what you tried to say in the end . 
  a politician should listen to the people . 
   and for far too long the right has taught the public that bombing , surveillance , anti-privacy , racism and profiling are the solution . 
  you should tell the israelis that cuz that 's what they 're doing , and sadly ... it works . 
   where disenfranchised morons kill their co-nationals in the name of a religion that they do n't understand . 
  ah yes , the no true scotsman fallacy . 
   the real solution is difficult to implement and demands to review most of the things we 've done in the last 60 years . 
  and what is that solution ? 
  solving poverty ? 
  poland is waaay waaaay poorer than france yet one of the safest countries in europe . 
  and do n't talk about `` discrimination '' , because i 'll point to the gypsies that everybody shits on yet oddly no gypsy terrorism . 
  how odd . 
  no really . 
  what 's the * real * solution you 've got ? 
   so for me it is only normal that people support right wing actions ( the same that the americans have been implementing since 2001 ) : there are no other actions that are being discussed . 
  yeah cuz we really wan na invade a foreign country now . 
   do you mean ibrahim el bakraoui yup . 
  his name was already given last friday as the guy that rented the forest apartment they were hiding in . 
  but they were at 3 before the attacks . 
  what taxi drivers ? 
   what is needed is a change of laws for these extreme situations ... 
  i agree with you man . 
  that 's the correct view to have . 
   has pandered to the right because there 's support for right wing type actions ? 
  since when is doing what people ask you to do , pandering ? 
   investing in the poor banlieues yeah , we 've had 40 years of those : http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/02/20/01016-20130220artfig00388-40-ans-de-plan-banlieue.php  and then 13th november happened and they went all george w. bush on us . 
  are you comparing iraq which was athreat to no one with isis ? 
  mkay man . 
   after the attacks on charlie hebdo i heard some real leftist proposals : republican and secularism education - or more of it , yeah , because those young french people that [ refused to respect a moment of silence after charlie hebdo ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/01/09/01016-20150109artfig00338-ces-minutes-de-silence-qui-ont-derape-dans-les-ecoles.php ) just actually need a secular education guys . 
   so : no lesson learned . 
  move along people . 
  nothing to see . 
  increased spending on intelligence , better management of prisons ( i gave the link in a different comment ) , creating databases with those involved , border controls . 
  it is not nothing . 
  in terms of education you can also point to polony that suggest enforcing the position of teachers and increasing their powers . 
   but how will any of this prevent the next attack ? 
  not much , but our nerves are stretched to the maximum . 
  the right already dominated the left by 2 to 1 votes ( that 's friggin huge ) . 
  if things get worse the left risks becoming the 3rd option . 
  the main battle ground is the economy and the left is getting clobbered worse than those baby seals . 
   security failings - people who should have been flagged at borders were not identifieid that and the fact that one terrorist had his papers confiscated by the police because he wanted to go to syria . 
  he went later to a police station saying they got lost . 
  they made him new ones . 
  and he left . 
  he did enter back in france and killed a bunch of people at bataclan . 
  darn what a success story for our police . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2016/01/14/terrorisme-les-objectifs-ambitieux-des-quartiers-dedies-aux-detenus-radicalises_4847214_1653578.html they 'll start changing that . 
  and the most radical prisoners will be isolated . 
   she was right . 
  debatable . 
  she went to a foreign news organisation and gave information about the govt decisions that were factually wrong . 
   they tried to pander to the right wing with the current state of emergency lets look at the last french elections : * 32 % of the votes for the left wing parties * 40 % for the right wing parties * 27 % for the extreme right ( fn ) you can see that the left wing is in a bit of a pickle ( ** for the first time ** fns result was consistent , it did n't decrease ) . 
  hollande is doing the only thing he can do , try to appeal to the center . 
  he is a political animal and he is letting go of the extreme left wing policies . 
  the extreme left wing knows very well it is irrelevant . 
  they can either go with hollande or they can sabotage him and end up with a second round sarkozy-le pen . 
  they actually chose to sabotage hollande . 
   they just took a big shit on their principles and did nothing else . 
  [ 85 % of french are for the withdrawal of citizenship ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/12/30/selon-un-sondage-85-des-francais-sont-favorables-a-la-decheance-de-nationalite_4839945_1653578.html ) [ 79 % were for extending the state of emergency back in january ] ( http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/79-pourcents-francais-favorables-prolongation-etat-urgence-jerome-fourquet-2568017.html ), 
   this is what i do n't understand about the ` cancel their citizenship and kick them out ! ', 
  line of reasoning so many on here prescribe to . 
  uhm you also imprison them . 
  when they get out of jail ( hopefully only when they become senile ) you can deport them to any country that accepts them.for a bribe , we 'll find willing countries just like australia found . 
   they both commit illegal acts of terrorism , hence my comparison ... did anonymous commit genocide ? 
   european intelligence likely already knows . 
  just let me say these : all the terrorist that attacked france and had lived in france ( the abdeslam 's while french never lived in france ) were know by the secret services . 
   intelligence needs to do what it was originally designed to do and keep an eye on high risk people . 
  they are .
