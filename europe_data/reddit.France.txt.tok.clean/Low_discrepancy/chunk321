  very wise decision russia has to be convinced assad can not stay . 
  let the syrian people decide what they want to do . 
  wait till assad starts mowing through the kurds . 
  we 'll see you talk then . 
   so is melenchon . 
  yeah . 
  vote for the guy that wants to leave the eu . 
  good luck with that buddy . 
   let 's be selfish : syria is in a mess , but the only alternatives to assad are islamist parties that intend to do terrorist attacks in europe . 
  we never managed to buy peace by dealing with the devil . 
  charmberlain with hitler , churchill with stalin in his percentage agreement , schroeder with putin . 
  time and time again we tried negociating with the devil and we lost . 
   i prefer that syria stays a dictatorship and does not become a permanent base for islamic terrorists . 
  actually , you 'll end up having both , just like it is now . 
   i hope the largest part of the german and french population think like we do . 
  macron is favourable for an intervention better vote fillon and le pen . 
  they be your friends . 
   unfortunately a large portion of the population who are seemingly willing to aid and abet terrorist groups so we must kill them all . 
   french bashing with muh algeria and muh colonization is always so funny dude the amount of butthurt from french people that still get miffed when someone talks about how horrible the algerian war was handled really shocked me . 
  i mean wtf ? 
  even yesterday during macron 's show on france 2 was disgusting . 
  you have this supposed history teacher shitting on him for wanting to deal with this issue . 
  and regarding syria , hollande did want an intervention back in 2013 . 
   i hope france does n't consider getting involved in this . 
  i hope it does . 
  any syrian opposition is getting mowed down and now we have assad that wants his regime to continue and has the full support of russia . 
  that is not possible . 
   no work permit , no recourse to public funds etc etc. 
  well yeah . 
  you 're not in the eu . 
   well there 's no proof it was assad and no reason he would do this . 
  what do you mean no reason ? 
  he could have tested trump 's resolution in not intervening . 
  he could be running low on bombs . 
  he 's already using friggin barrel bombs because he ran out of ammunition . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_syrian_civil_war_barrel_bomb_attacks if you have a general that 's asked to find a quick solution and he has some chemical weapons about , well congrats ... 
   replaced by who ? 
  by a guy who does n't use barrel bombs to kill people ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_syrian_civil_war_barrel_bomb_attacks look how many people killed . 
  we managed to find a replacement for p\u00e9tain , i trust they 'll be able to find something too . 
   thank god you have no power here . 
  like you do . 
  it 's nice that there are leaders out there that are responsible enough . 
   i think it 's because there might be a civil war in syria and every death is justified amirite ? 
  no war crimes were committed ? 
  this shit never happened : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_violations_during_the_syrian_civil_war#syrian_government_and_allied_forces right ? 
  in the other threads people have a full on boner for assad . 
   we do know why , it 's called war . 
  blaming a specific side or the other is non-sense at this point . 
  okay it was war guys . 
  nazis kill a bunch of people ... meh it was war we ca n't condemn anybody . 
  serbians kill 8000 people , hey war amirite ? 
  we can not pass blame . 
  leave assad alone :'(  al nusra received chemical component used for weapon coming from the turkey border a few days before the attack . 
  sauce . 
  also you mean to say that turkey gave them the chemical weapons needed for this attack ? 
   regardless , of this specific event nobody get batshit crazy when the us vaporised 200 civilians a few weeks ago . 
  muh whataboutism . 
  syrian regimes kills 100k people . 
  but omg did you see us ** vaporised ** 200 people : o, 
   trump 's airstrike benefits the rebels and is and will prolong the civil war . 
  so lets leave assad to his chemical weapons . 
  im starting to wonder where did all these people supporting assad using chemical weapons come from . 
  edit correction . 
   until there is a real independent investigation yeah . 
  350k people died in syria but we still do n't know why . 
  must have been islamic state , amirite ? 
   support the people attacked by the regime how exactly do you help those people , out of curiosity ? 
  everybody says assad needs to go . 
  and assad needs to go . 
  beauty is in the eye of the beholder . 
   but the proportions are a bit odd , the bow being so much lower than the stern makes it look like its sinking . 
  that 's what i like about it . 
  [ looks slick . 
  ] ( http://pop.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/1600x800/landscape-1445543607-yacht.jpg )  that 's cos you 're french . 
  / jk well the designer was french apparently so i guess :p, 
   i did n't think he was bitching he says it himself that he was bitching . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63sapb/leaked_document_theresa_may_sabotaged_a_plan_to/dfwramh/ for a democratic lad as yourself , you sure love to put your own words in other people 's mouth . 
  to end this discussion . 
  no uk was not forced to do anything it did n't agree to prior . 
  i 'm sure we are all fervent defenders of democracy and rule of law here . 
  and as such , it is plainly obvious to see that uk and the eu respected both democracy and the rule of law . 
  there was no obligation aspect unlike what / u/ineed3quid claims to have existed . 
  nobody forced uk to do anything and uk was in full control of what was happening . 
  why would you want british immigrants to be kicked out of france : s, 
  just do n't bitch about how the uk must do this and must do that like / u/ineed3quid . 
  uk agreed to it , that 's the beautiful thing about democracy . 
  nobody forces you to do anything . 
   over exaggerating it 's okay though . 
  french words be tough . 
   the eu makes it so that the uk must accept all eu immigrants uk agreed to that . 
   uk must accept all refugees that the other eu countries let in uk has a veto on who enters the eu . 
   why should we turn down people with good degrees from outside of europe for anyone who feels like it that is from europe ? 
   rutherford got a nobel-prize in chemistry though later , which is exactly why i love this quote . 
  when you 'll produce work worthy of a nobel prize , we 'll let / r/iamverysmart comments slide . 
  how ? 
   ( ernest rutherford ) when you 'll get a nobel prize like him , you 'll be excused from making / r/iamverysmart comments . 
   but lets be honest ... thats how the eu authorities would react to it eu is not academia , so i do n't really understand your point . 
   mechanical engineer and medical scientists if you believe that people in academia in stem are not concerned about ** all funding ** in ** all academia ** , lem me ask you , have you actually interacted with anyone involved in any type of academia ? 
   closing down bme ( budapest university of technology ) or semmelweis university of medicine would be a loss for the scientific community .
