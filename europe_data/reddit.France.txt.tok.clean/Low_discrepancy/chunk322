  closing down ceu ? 
  i do n't like this action , but no one should believe that ceu is irreplaceable powerhouse of actual science . 
  ** muh steeeem ** ( and i say this as a stem educated individual ) . 
   russian trolls woke up early  i have noticed lately some russian troll activity . 
  i wonder if it 's just selective bias from my part or if it 's actually happening . 
   i meant courses in the eu , dear depends on the class . 
  just going : `` oh putin sponsores it . 
  omg kill it with fire '' is unacademic . 
   so basically , the study of how feminist movements operate in developing countries and specific branches that try to push for a modern and feminist version of islamism . 
  but why do we need to study societal changes and trends . 
  and why do we need to study non european societies ? 
  we all know they 're backwards . 
  indeed so many of the comments on / r/europe are full of it . 
  weird . 
  i think it 's [ stunning ] ( http://cdn.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/yachta.jpg ) . 
   you only need a few whores and a close liaison with uncle vlad for a final touch lol [ boom ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dominique-strauss-kahn-dodo-the-pimp-and-the-carlton-hotel-frances-major-trial-of-2015-10004172.html ) and [ boom ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/24/europe/putin-le-pen-kremlin/ ) brother !, 
   but we feel we have a more egalitarian relationship with the spanish . 
  aww . 
  so you think of us as a sort of a role model , a bigger cousin you should follow and has better wine ? 
  it 's okay italy , you can go on play dates with spain . 
   he knows he ca n't win so he just says what he wants without consequences . 
  there 's a difference between saying whatever you want and having the skill to say the exact correct phrase . 
  and especially to make it seem natural and not like a rant . 
  we do n't have worker immunity is an epic phrase . 
  i thought you were talking about france . 
  basques :p, 
  :'( you do n't ever share separatist groups with italy ps i appreciate that someone got the joke, 
   we 're cousins you guys do n't even share a border . 
   it 's not * companies * that are their advising . 
  it 's a representative of the company well here 's the thing . 
  * companies * per se do n't exist . 
  they 're just the ceo and board of directors . 
  and in matters of secrecy and importance , the board entrusts the ceo . 
  and that 's it . 
   been called to share their expertise , and who is n't allowed to relay what 's going on back to the rest of the company . 
  the rest of the company is the ceo . 
  there 's the guy who has the info : the representative that was sent . 
  and there 's the ceo so you 're telling me that the representative of the company does not talk to the ceo . 
  i find that extremely unlikely . 
   but almost anyone that actually takes an interest knows more than the average joe . 
  you seem to have an interest . 
  in the tpp deal did you know more than the few ceos of the major industries ? 
  i doubt that very much . 
  again we deal with an actor with great influence , great power , great capabilities of manoeuvrability , unified and in little numbers and put it against a domestic player , that is slow , dispersed and fractured . 
  and you 're telling me that this model does take into account this asymmetry of power , information , rationality , reaction time ? 
  i 'll assume that it does n't since these things are barely being understood in mathematical models of game theory . 
  so if they 're not taken into account , how can you say that they do n't really matter ? 
   but just as representatives of key sectors are given some access , so too are environmental groups ( under the tepac ) , labour groups ( under the lac ) , consumer groups , etc. 
  they 're all under strict ndas and security clearances . 
  if they talk to people about it , they 're going to prison for a long time , as well as paying a huge fine . 
  it makes sense to have representatives of those most affected taking part . 
  seems to me that a major issue is asymmetry of information and power . 
  you said it yourself , it 's sufficient for the dairy industry to find out and create havoc . 
  it is sufficient for a few key players in major industries ( since all major industries are dominated by a few key players ) to be in the know and that 's it . 
  the domestic player gets shafted . 
  ( of course it 's a slight exaggeration , but the domestic player would get a worse deal ) . 
  we 're dealing with a domestic player that has very little information and works on democracy so inertia and the decision process is slow . 
  and put it sometimes against private interests which do not work on democracy , where the leader can set the goals and everybody immediatly follows making it a very potent , nibble , fast and powerful player . 
  in a deal regarding financial services , do you mean to tell me that the heads of gs and jpm do not know what the details are ? 
  that they discover everything at the same time as everyone else ? 
   red white and blue ? 
  what have the french got to do with it [ ** this ** is the french flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/flag_of_france.svg ) . 
  you can see that it is blue , white and red . 
  really awesome trains , loved it . 
  once i took the prima class . 
  much better than tgv first class . 
  but goddamn those leather seats made me feel like in that seinfeld episode where you could n't stay on the seat and just keep sliding down . 
   if then, 
   we do n't , they do n't list what they did . 
  you sound like trump . 
  you state something false : it 's a twitter poll and when you 're told that yeah dude , you 're wrong , you just say `` we just do n't know , guys '' . 
  oh , i thought you were talking about deez nutz, 
  if they give 2 billion , they 'd only have 0.5 more to give . 
   nuts-2 i think the proper phrasing is 2 nuts . 
   real guyana happens to me all the time when i google the real saint martin . 
  i was confused how for apparently a region with high unemployment , a metric fuckton of people were out shopping at all times of day ( and night ) . 
  and by god i need a bottle of pedro ximenez . 
  am confused . 
  one 's for grave accent ` , the other for acute ' and circumflex \\ ^ . 
   to everyone who will cry : it is nothing to do with this sub , it is local crime -- try to think why they bury her in israel . 
  she is french . 
  her family members are french . 
  they are doing it because their france is no more . 
  so that 's how some jewish people live ? 
  they pass around news about how omg people are out to kill them ? 
  then again i assume a lot of people from many minorities do that . 
  heck even / r/the _ dodo is full of people that live in fear and under assumptions that everybody outside their little sphere is out to kill them . 
  a crazy person killed a woman . 
  that is very sad . 
  very sad things happen . 
  let 's hope that people stop living in fear too . 
   i think brexit was a bad decision , but trade is a net benefit for both parties involved even if one of them never exports anything , free trade may be a net benefit but it may not be a benefit for everybody . 
   and even if that were n't the case , why should a first-world nation waste its comparative advantage in services and high-end goods to satisfy a manufacturing fetish ? 
  i reheheheally doubt this free trade agreement will include services . 
  and generally high end goods tend to employ only a small number of people . 
   a mcdonalds cheeseburger cost ~ 1 $ , same as in germany  a cappucino is about ~ 1.50 $  just ate a doner kebab today for ~ 3 $ cheeseburger in france is [ 2.3 ] ( http://www.fastfoodprix.fr/mcdonalds-prix/ ) , a cappuccino is somewhere around 2.5-3 euros . 
  a kebab is somewhere around 6 euros . 
   i think if you combine everything if you want to live the same lifestyle in eastern europe as in western europe it 's going to cost you about 70-75 % of the western cost . 
  you 're comparing with germany that is known for its very low prices and not with other countries . 
   the entire point of lighting up the tower would be to show solidarity with the russian people .
