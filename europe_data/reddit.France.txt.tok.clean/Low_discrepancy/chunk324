  i am so annoyed by this push to render old city centers lifeless . 
  where the aesthetics for tourists matters more than the practicality of people living there . 
   turgut is paying the price for something that he says has not previously been a problem : his german remains rough at best , more than 25 years after he came to austria from turkey . 
  mayor klaus schneeberger says that makes him someone `` we do n't need '' in what will soon be the refurbished market area . 
  well it 's also this quote that apparently the mayor said so if he did say that , that 's kinda shitty . 
   1106 persons polled , 769 persons who are certain to vote , 586 who know for whom . 
  and this is just the result for the 589 people then ? 
  ungrateful cunts !, 
  yeah i heard you all when eder scored, 
  i can swear that the first image on top says 586 r\u00e9pondants . 
   morco  catolonia  gibaltar dude i 'm amazed you spelled correctly basque . 
  do we have to give back our seat ibizas : s, 
  reading the text : number of people polled : 585 that are certain to go voting . 
  that means about a 4 % margin . 
   do n't go there for holidays do n't go to spain , go to ibiza !, 
   so what exactly is xenophobic lumping all spanish speaking countries into one entity . 
  trying to pretend that what happened in the falklands has by any stretch any connection with the situation in gibraltar because `` oh spanish speaking '' . 
  * how to do jingoism 101 * the guy : * 1 / talks about war ** when he is not asked about war ** * 2 / talks about protecting the ** freedoms of another small ** group of brits * 3 / introduces an irrelevant foreigner concept in the mix : spanish speaking countries . 
  so as to suggest that there 's once more a small group of little defenseless brits out there against countries of foreigners out there . 
  and his jongoism worked marvelously . 
  you went in full ermergeerd we gots to defend freedomz of porz britains !, 
  as per your previous comment . 
  instead of saying , yeah he 's needlessly belicose . 
  huh ? 
  wtf are you talking about . 
  talking about how you totally kicked ** another spanish speaking ** country 's ass when a reporter does ** not ** talk at all about war is xenophobic . 
  bringing the fact that both argentina and spain speak spanish is ** completely irrelevant ** to the discussion so that insertion seems very very odd . 
   this is exactly the issue , your empahsis ( which is exactly what the media is doing ) . 
  so no jewish person was ever a xenophobic idiot ? 
  how did i not know that ? 
  next you 'll tell me he has spanish friends so he ca n't be xenophobic ? 
  but you got ta check their peepee man to see if they 're actually mosleeems . 
  every bad thing came from mosleeemz . 
  plz sweden . 
   some old fart that old fart war former tory party leader just before cameron . 
   answers a baited question in a way he would , & nbsp ;  i admire your optimism there . 
  one of the perhaps more serious things that 's been in the news in recent weeks has been the future of the union because of course we have a situation now where the scottish nationalists want a second referendum in scotland , the future of power sharing in northern ireland hangs in the balance , even gibraltar now appears to be on the table . 
  how worried are you about it ? 
  notice ; ** no mention of war ** . 
  answer :  i 'm not concerned . 
  if we take gibraltar first , i think there 's no question whatever that our government will stand by gibraltar . 
  35 years ago this week another woman prime minister sent a task force halfway across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of british people against another spanish speaking country and i 'm absolutely certain that our current prime minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of gibraltar . 
  i 'll quote fawlty here : [ do n't mention the war !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 )  another small group of british people against ** another spanish speaking country ** also he sounds like a xenophobic shitbag . 
   why we have n't just incorporated our overseas territories like france has done . 
  not all our overseas territories are incorporated . 
  some have a great deal of autonomy and are not even part of the eu . 
   someone was asked a hypothetical question , gave the only answer you can give `` we will protect our territory if attacked '' . 
  what exactly is wrong here ? 
  when someone asks a hypothetical question , you do n't have to answer . 
  ** and ** you do n't fucking mention a war when ** the question does not mention war ** :  i admire your optimism there .

  emphasis mine . 
  dude sound like quite a xenophobic retard . 
  also : do n't talk about the war !,

   is language considered ethnic based in france ? 
  http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ethnicity  an ethnic group ; a social group that shares a common and distinctive culture , religion , language , or the like : & nbsp ;  as a german , i tend to think of germans as people whose native language is german , that includes volga germans and children of immigrants . 
  what you consider and what * is * are two different things . 
  you consider children of immigrants as being germany only if they were born after 2000 . 
  otherwise you would not be able to deport those german born radicalised people . 
  you do not consider those people german because you had no jus soli prior to 2000 . 
  you consider volga germans , danube swabians , transylvania saxons as germans because germans have an ethnicity based view on the construction of the state . 
  french do n't consider quebecans as being french . 
  it is milti-fold but the main current reason is because in the construction of the french state we do not recognise ethnic groups . 
  we consider french citizenship to be a universal thing not an ethnic based thing . 
  someone from french guyana is just as french according to the law as someone from paris . 
  another example : we had jus soli ( giving citizenship for people born on french soil ) under certain conditions since 1804 . 
  germany since 2000 . 
  you do realise there are far more regional languages than breton right ? 
  it probably has an even larger variety than germany , we have here german languages ( alsacian ) , celtic , romance and basque ( who knows what that kind is ), 
  the german flag is leaking .

  je comprends pourquoi on a perdu la guerre des m\u00e8mes . 
  all engineers left so there was nobody that remained to design a brain plug ? 
  31 mars ? 
  je comprends pas . 
   unlike catalonia which is constantly told no you 're staying no matter what . 
  i fail to see how that 's relevant to the discussion since spain has one constitution and uk ... does n't have one . 
  are you saying spain is doing something unconstitutional ? 
   different circumstances stop stretching . 
  you should respect your own advice . 
   though it seems some spanish politicians are pushing for a chance of circumstances when it come to gibraltar . 
  you should talk to some israelis man . 
  they 're the most helpless of people under siege from those fierce palestinians . 
   that 's interesting because i voted remain did you vote for trump though ? 
   though i guess just making assumptions is easier than actually asking someone their political stances now days .
