  neah . 
  i still think i got the trump comment right . 
   but they agreed to be with us on foreign policy decisions . 
  that is what they voted for by voting to be a british overseas territory . 
  it 's part of the deal , they can handle many of their own affairs but foreign policy and defence are decided by the uk as a whole . 
  that 's like a dude giving a slap to his wife and saying : well she did n't divorce me so she agrees to this !, 
   for now ah yes . 
  i forgot , you 're under siege . 
   spain has n't disrespected this yet . 
  but the spaniards who suggest annexation here do . 
  because those people commenting on reddit are rajoy right ? 
   letting spain annex gibraltar i did not know we had torries in france . 
  in your imaginary world spain annexed gibraltar ? 
  fascinating shit right there . 
   it was a typo and how is spain not respecting gilbratarians and their wishes ? 
   but we are but no you are n't . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_ ( referendum ) _ act_2016 _ ( gibraltar )  they voted to remain a british overseas territory . 
  and spain respected that . 
  case closed . 
   why would you assume that ? 
  gilbratarians [ 95 % remainers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_\\ ( referendum \\ ) _ act_2016 _ \\ ( gibraltar \\ ) ) this is the [ result ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8399036-3x2-700x467.jpg ), 
   which referendum ? 
  well / u/fatortu lives in an imaginary world where spain did n't respect the wishes of the gibraltarians and i brought him to the current world where it is uk that is not respecting the wishes of gibraltarians . 
  one hautvote for the master troll . 
  you masterfully triggered quite a few anglos :'), 
   my problem here is that some spaniards do n't want to respect the gibraltarian referendum . 
  well uk will ignore the gilbraltarian referendum that is the most recent . 
  that being said , people bitching about spain wanting to annex gibraltar are ridiculous . 
  they surely do n't like a tax haven at their doorstep just like we do n't really like it when monaco or switzerland do it . 
   i find it very concerned when the government does illegal things , thankyouverymuch . 
  the govt ca n't send you to jail . 
  prosecutors can really eff your day . 
  better 10 guilty men go free etc etc etc. 
  but then again you excused the dna from doing unconstitional actions based on `` well the govt deffo lied '', 
  nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie is supposed to have an indyref in 2018 . 
  here , have a [ consolation 3rd place prize ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wriidp93yp0 ), 
   however , what the dna investigated was the legality of the procedure for passing the emergency ordinance . 
  and the constitutional court declared that it mounted to intimidation . 
  https://www.ccr.ro/files/products/decizia_68+opinie.pdf  point 121 . 
  ** dna extended their area of competences beyons its legal right ** ... their put pressure on the members of the govt and intimidated the people delegated to the ministery of justice . 
  moreover the act of starting a massive inqueiry , interviewing a large number of public workers , state scretaries etc creates a situation of tension and might create blocks in the process of legislation . 
  romania 's ** highest court ** said that what the dna did was excessive . 
   the lies and tampered papers that sneaked the ordinance itself on the order of the day . 
  again the cc court said it 's not the job of the dna to question if this happens . 
   point 125 , ** dna does not have the competency to perform penal enquiries regarding the legality and opportunity of a law-making act . 
  & nbsp ;  this is a big one . 
  if i as a person were to lie in official government papers the dna ** dropped ** their enquiry . 
  ( probably because it was illegal but that 's neither here nor there ) . 
  i find it very concerning that romanians are n't concerned that their prosecutors do illegal things . 
  any european prosecutor should ** respect the laws ** of the eu and the nations that comprise the eu . 
   this ? 
  they can do that ** and ** [ win ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6b7bhgkkqa ), 
   france has 7x inhabitants . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  they can create niche industries where they excel . 
   france has much higher visibility than denmark ( therefore higher attractivity ) . 
  they can also implement scholarships to attract the best and the brightest . 
  since they 're not a huge country , they do n't need hundreds of thousands of foreign citizens . 
   yes , but it 'd make us a technological backwater in regards to international education . 
  a lot of classes in france are in french . 
  we 'll give you a call when we become a technological backwater . 
   by asking us to provide it for all who come they 're asking us to get rid of it . 
  we 're telling you to not discriminate based on nationality . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/denmark/balance-of-trade see that nice positive trade balance ? 
  would be a shame if every country would start again to discriminate based on nationality , would it not ? 
   i hope that by now dna is a solid institution and no longer needs a strong chief-prosecutor did n't the dna get condemned by the romanian constitutional court because they started a penal procedure against those that wrote the govt decree ? 
  it amounted to intimidation so it was deemed unconstitutional ? 
   short version of the article is that education given in english to foreign students means the vast majority leaves after graduation . 
  the minister is therefore restricting the number of educations with english as the teaching language there ya go . 
  i oppose offering different rules for different people . 
  once we start a single market then we need convergence . 
  we should treat nationality as we 'd treat skin colour or gender but i have absolutely no opposition in offering jobs or benefits to people who speak the language for example . 
  uk makes divided by zero better tv than the rest of europe !, 
  what 's your most selling papers ? 
   i wonder if it 's really possible to bike from moscow to minsk . 
  from milan to minsk you deffo have a journey . 
  if you 're biking with cars going 90km/h just 1 m away from you i 'd recommend that you buy a pair of gloves too . 
   marseille to monaco they exist only on small stretches of road . 
  from cannes to toulon there 's almost no bike path for example . 
  and from nice to cannes they 're not securized , they 're just the shoulder of the road . 
  people in this thread or the turks this chick is talking about ? 
   not really going to convince the uk that returning to a union where there is such clear contempt for democracy would be a good idea . 
   cleaner not anymore :(, 
  i 've prepared all my life for this . 
  i 've stored so many kebabs in my love handles . 
  they can bring on the embargo . 
  my sweat pores ooze kebab , i wo n't suffer . 
  they can into greece . 
  great song . 
  thanks . 
  an unplugged version of this song would be awesome . 
   me too , and i have a feeling it will probably need it . 
  the only ref on the horizon is the scottish one . 
   not the kids you get in the guardian or mail message boards !, 
  no more prosecco !, 
  we should make a nice playlist of songs of some european songs about saying goodbye . 
  french entry would be daniel balavoine 's [ au revoir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-dwbc72nuw ) main lyrics   au revoir au revoir   faire la part des choses / setting things straight   se dire que l'on ose / telling ourselves that we dare   tout remettre en cause / questioning everything   et partir / and leaving i 'm curious what other countries have out there . 
  [ bye bye baby ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvrrle4lihy ), 
  what current afd voters used to vote for . 
  do you have any stats where they take votes from ?
