  they are part of their country . 
   you 're comparing apples and oranges no no . 
  some on / r/europe is comparing people they like vs people they dislike . 
  those they like : give'em all the rights . 
  those they dislike : let 's make excuses why we should n't give them their rights . 
   there is no protestant islam to go hand in hand with secularism well that would mean that protestant societies would be more secular , and that 's not true . 
  secularism is not an x then y process . 
  i do n't feel particularly safe when i see some old dude that 's mumbling to himself , walking around nervously in the bus station and the barrel of his handgun can be seen under his coat . 
  nor do i feel particularly safe when there 's an x-ray control at every bus and train station . 
   i hope they find their new home safer . 
  israel safer ? 
  [ makes sense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vercingetorix#/media/file:cesare_prima_gallia_58_a.c._jpg.jpg ) that vercingetorix was quite a wino was n't he ? 
   chilean [ chile makes way more wine though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wine-producing_countries ), 
  some spanish wine for my italibro here !, 
  nice to see we left a mark of [ our passage ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/allied_occupation_in_germany_%281945-1949%29.png/250px-allied_occupation_in_germany_%281945-1949%29.png ), 
   people will think of america almost all romance speaking countries from europe and sa have an upper chamber called senate . 
   senate is american what ? 
   i do n't think germany wants to ** deport people who have german citizenship . 
  i am willing to go the extra mile for raspies . 
   no one cares ( legally ) about the echr . 
  i doubt germany will be willing to ignore a ecthr rulling . 
   so deporting people who are n't german can you read ? 
   presumably they could deport people who hold dual citizenship i do n't think germany wants to deport people who have german citizenship . 
  it would be a nasy repeat of a precedent . 
  italibro , let 's have a drink . 
   i bet you that the investigators there wo n't be half as eager to announce or investigate any problems next time something like this comes up . 
  then the investigators in europe will catch them and it will be much much worse for them . 
  ( see the diesel scandal where regulators in europe were absolutely shocked ... shocked to find out what car companies were doing ) . 
   i wish they 'd give some concrete examples of biased reports . 
  ca n't you see that they suffer particular pain when they check bbc . 
  do you want them to suffer more . 
   people forget that such attack are as much a victory for the far right as for the islamists . 
  i 'd say it 's a victory for both . 
  both want a polarised society . 
  and people stuck in the middle that just want to live their lives have to bear with their shit . 
   i think europe was safer in the period between the end of the yugoslav wars and 2003 . 
  we russia was bombing chechnya and nato was bombing serbia ? 
  if you say so man . 
   to them terror attacks are a pr victory , no , no . 
  they are sad :( they celebrate with sadness in their heart . 
   france and belgium on the other hand are bombing syria . 
  we 're at war . 
  neo nazi parties , islamic groups , etc. 
  innocent until proven guilty . 
  innocent until proven guilty . 
  that 's how the law works . 
   dost does n't give a fuck about human rights do you have proof they do n't intend to respect human rights ? 
  would you define de gaulle as a dictator ? 
  edit : in '67 de gaulle went to canada and proclaimed [ vive le qu\u00e9bec libre !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vive_le_qu%c3%a9bec_libre ) which greatly upset the canadians . 
  the pm declared that canadians do n't need to be liberated . 
  meanwhile , the bulgarian tukish party dost was n't allowed to form at the beginning https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ruyez/bulgaria_denies_registration_to_dost_party_over/ because apparently dost means friend in turkish and bulgaria does n't allow ethnic based parties . 
  and now erdogan is complaining because some turkish people were n't allowed in bulgaria . 
  so i 'm kinda curious if you think that what de gaulle did was acceptable or if you think he acted like erdogan ? 
   it 's easy to say such things when you 're france . 
  it 's not easy to protect human rights . 
  it is hard . 
   they have rights , http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/  everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association . 
  prove that bulgarians turks are not peaceful . 
  so because turkey has a big military , that means that turkish minorities do n't deserve to get rights . 
   hungary is nothing like turkey . 
  then you proceed to say how hungary is exactly like turkey . 
   other countries do n't border turkey so turkish minorties do n't deserve their rights ? 
  you could read from / u/mihnea100 that romania has a hungarian party and romanians and hungarian animosity is a long history . 
  one of the most common complaints from hungary is how they lost land like transylvania . 
   it 's an issue of national defence other countries have parties for minorities or regional parties . 
  it 's ridiculous to claim that it 's a national defense issue . 
   but why should the government give housing to some random people ? 
  it 's not random people . 
  it 's poor people . 
   will tell you why yeah ... fascinating tell me more, 
   do you know the laws in romania right after communism ? 
  here you go dude http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=31856  even if the government had to maintain them , why did n't they found somewhere else to live 12 after their housing was deemed as unlivable ? 
  major victim blaming here . 
  why did n't poor people find housing even though their govt refused to give it to them ? 
  why are romania and bulgaria super poor countries ? 
  why are the majority of hookers one meets on the streets romanian ? 
  why does bulgaria have so much organised crime and political killings ? 
  shit happens , people are poor . 
  what 's your point ? 
   scare turks in thinking they are attacked from every side . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ruyez/bulgaria_denies_registration_to_dost_party_over/ seems like bulgaria banned this party because dost means friend in turkish and bulgaria does n't allow parties based on ethnicities ... which kinda seems like a human right though . 
   that 's because the country was transitioning from communism to democracy , and these building were asked to be returned to the owners from whom they were seized the govt didn '' have any problems to collect rent though , meaning they were still the owners of the buildings and as such had an obligation to maintain them . 
   bulgaria also expelled a turkish citizen and banned two others from entering the country , after reports a turkish minister had campaigned for the dost party that represents bulgarian turks , the country 's largest ethnic minority . 
  what 's the dost party and why were the people banned ? 
   these buildings are deem dangerous and you refuse to understand that these buildings became dangerous because the govt did n't maintain the for 2005-1989 = 16 years . 
  keep renting a house for 16 years without any maintenance and come back and tell me in what state you find it . 
  there 's nothing i can do for you . 
  if you refuse to understand that the landlord has the obligation to maintain a house , then you might not fully know all the rights of a person that rents . 
  cheers . 
  why would that make sense ? 
  yes . 
  what makes sense to you ? 
   yeah the people in the article lived did you read the full article :  before 1989 , the communist state re-located roma families from the outskirts of bucharest into the city , closer to factories and schools and often placing them in older houses . 
   after the fall of communism , the state continued to rent the buildings to roma families but maintenance work stopped . 
   but it 's the sensical thing to do what 's sensical ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  can you lay it out ? 
  the govt that 's collecting rent . 
  did you bother reading the article ?
