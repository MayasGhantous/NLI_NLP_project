  yeah . 
  we should stop feeding the troll . 
   why not terrorise his own country ? 
  do you think tunisia or france are lacking in terrorists ? 
  if you offer any time of housing so people can live in , you must respect certain conditions that make it liveable . 
  you ca n't ask people to pay rent for a box . 
  or if walls fall apart . 
  but putin never killed anyo ... actually nvm . 
  okay . 
  we did have a former vichy policeman [ kill some 30 algeriens ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_du_17_octobre_1961 ) , put a nice huuuge banner on a parisian bridge saying [ here we drown algerians ] ( https://www.cairn.info/loadimg.php?file=gen/gen_049/gen_049_0140/gen_idpas_d_isbn_pu2002-04s_sa09_art09_img001.jpg ) and fished out of the seine 300 algerian bodies only in 1961 . 
  so i guess you 're right . 
   if god forbid , war ever broke out between turkey and a european state . 
  when war happened in algeria we did n't have any significant problems from the algerians living in france . 
  so not sure what your point is . 
   stop pointing out statistics , i am talking real life over here . 
  when data disagrees with us we bury our head and shout : i know how real life * is * . 
   why ? 
  no go zones mate . 
  evil moslems out to kills us . 
  we 're turning arabic as we spea ... 
  god dammit . 
  see !, 
  i 'm turning mosl ... salam alaikum, 
  no go zone . 
   pockets of people which ones ? 
  radical islamists ? 
  old timey italian anarchists ? 
  german / italian marxists ? 
  italian extreme right ? 
  i see you do n't understand . 
  one 's when you want to send us your own citizens , the other is when we send them back to you , 
  i do n't think you understand the difference between deporting and expulsing . 
  did you fix the bug / r/melenchon, 
   we should send them to you cuz we do n't want them here , there is no reason to treat them better i bet you 'll stay for very long in the eu if your plan is massive deportation . 
   precisely in order to assimilate . 
  yet they retained their polish names . 
  that 's quite a shame . 
  you demand full assimilation . 
  go for it . 
   we have n't converted because we are atheist . 
  only a tiny percentage of people are [ atheists ] ( https://i.redd.it/shyvnpt2kamx.png ) . 
  the vast majority either believe in god or believe that there is a life force out there . 
  also communism did have an impact . 
  you should revert to the traditional bulgarian ways which are orthodox . 
  it 's weird that you want to deviate from what is traditionally bulgarian and choose to take the lifestyle and ideas propagated from communism or other non-bulgarian sources . 
  i think a bulgarian romani that is orthodox ( and the majority are ) [ is much more assimilated to bulgaria than you are . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people#balkans ) . 
  they actually have a fair claim to demand that you assimilate . 
  it is absolutely weird for someone that demands assimilation to not fully immerse yourself in what is bulgarian and had a huge influence on bulgaria . 
  especially when you chose to identify as a pole in your first comment . 
   all five `` terrorists '' were taken in for questioning . 
  they said that they only wanted to make a joke , without realizing that it could turn into something serious . 
  they used the `` it 's * just * a prank bro ! '', 
  defense . 
  nothing you can do now , you got ta release them . 
   no one forced my family to assimilate in bulgaria . 
  no one forced my two half brothers to assimilate in austria , where they live as almost indistinguishable austrians despite their polish surnames . 
  then i am afraid you did n't understand the difference between assimilation and integration . 
  had your family taken an austrian surname as per tradition and culture in austria , had you converted to the orthodox church as per tradition in bulgaria , you would have assimilated . 
   the 96.4 % number is not the number of romanians owning a house it 's holy fuck dude . 
  in a family of 4 where the parents own the house , you 'd have a 100 % home ownershp . 
  it would be stupid to say that the home ownership is 50 % because the kids do n't own the house . 
  read the debate before commenting or do n't bother to comment . 
   / u / - runis - claimed that so many romanians live in rented places and that 's just bs . 
  in romania if you live in a home it 's extremely likely that you/family own that home . 
  that means that so so so many romanians live in housing they/their family do n't own . 
  but that 's bs . 
  where would so many homes that are rented come from when 96 % of homes are lived by their owner . 
  now again , go back and ** read ** the discussion . 
   if i actually did write that ( i wo n't dig back now to check ) you are entirely correct to point it out as wrong well then what i wanted to point out is that `` origin '' is a pointless topic . 
  i 'm sure you realised it by now . 
  and the assimilation you mention is a process imposed by force . 
   it 's thousands you think they can watch every single one 24 hours a day ? 
  you 'd be amazed what some people think . 
  be prepared for people that 'll demand the deportation of people known by the mi5, 
   the 96.4 % is not the percentage of romanians owning the residence they inhabit , but its the percentage of residences inhabited by their owners . 
  what kind of idiot would think that ? 
  if a romanian kid is born the number of romanians increases but it 's not like you give them a home . 
  / u / - runis - claimed that so many romanians live in rented places and that 's just bs . 
  in romania if you live in a home it 's extremely likely that you/family own that home . 
   never claimed the bulgars were thracians , & nbsp ;  bulgars , the people themselves have never been replaced from the land , merely conquered . 
  they are thracians with a different language and identity, 
   romania has been by far and away the most tolerant country in the world to gypsies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_governorate#the_holocaust_in_transnistria_under_romanian_occupation so the 20k gypsies romania killed , that was generosity ? 
  fuck me , i could do without romanian hospitality . 
  how about the roma slavery before 1850s ? 
  and do n't start comparing it with serfdom . 
   and as long as you abide by the laws of the land , you can live how you well damn please . 
  what do you do when the govt does n't abide by the law and gives you improper social housing . 
  i feel that you still do not understand the difference between travelling and right to settle . 
  if you 're confused , lem me help you : the eu is not a country . 
  and with the multi-speed eu that can not come fast enough , it should be obvious that the eu is not a country . 
   no one advocated for this here or claimed they should n't be accepted to assimilate . 
  so besides the fact that you do n't understand the difference between bulgarians and bulgars ( which you claimed were thracians , lel ) , now you do n't understand the difference between assimilation and integration . 
   in 50 years it will be your kids making excuses on reddit , about why their french government failed to integrate them . 
  i think the french gypsies are okay in france happy to be here.they 're not moving to other countries . 
   is like me fucking with you over your extensive muslim problem , by saying , `` well , if you 'd treat them better , maybe they would n't have killed so many of you at the bataclan '' i see my flair triggered you.the muslim problem has very little to do with their treatment . 
  they commit far more terrorism acts in iraq or syria . 
  also our treatment of muslims is far better than romania 's treatment of gypsies . 
  we never sent muslims to extermination camps , unlike romania and their gypsies . 
   that 's what makes them racists . 
  and what makes you racist is claiming that they do n't wash , that stinking is part of their culture .
