  that 's what makes you racist buddy boy . 
  do n't try and pretend you 're not because you listen to gypsy music and you appreciate a gypsy if they work hard and wash . 
   the fact is that before mass immigration that started in 1991 roughly 99 % of the population of italy was italian . 
  if you say so . 
  are you denying that bulgars were turkic even though that 's a historic fact ? 
  mkay . 
   we just got to be the eu whipping horse i cri evertme :'(  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/610ill/roma_fear_there_is_no_place_for_them_as_romanias/dfavrq7/ myes . 
  anecdotes . 
  you sure closed that debate . 
  you need better standards if yours is france in the 1800s . 
  wan na start colonies and claim blackies are inferior ? 
   when so many romanians live in rented places and do n't own anything . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate romania has ** one of the highest house ownerships in the world ** . 
   but they do n't need one to go to extremely hospitable france we have our faults . 
  no one is perfect . 
  but we 're trying . 
  thank you . 
   what was changing all the time and being replaces were people 's identities , languages , cultures and loyalties due to the changing ruling classes and states they lived in . 
  so what you mean to say is what matters is the identity and culture of a person not their genetics . 
  and if a person chooses to be defined as bulgarian , they should n't be asked to go back to india because 1000 years ago their ancestors left there ? 
  they 're bulgarians because that 's what they are ? 
  i am shocked . 
  shocked . 
   about `` mistreatment of ethnic minorities '' and how our communist ways have to change if we are to be allowed in the eu . 
  if you 'd treat them better maybe we would n't have so many all over europe . 
   should i say it in arabic ? 
  perhaps you misunderstood me . 
  arabic is a beautiful language . 
  i guess that people speaking multiple languages bothers you . 
  does culture bother you ? 
   italy italy ? 
  a people of blonde lombardians in the north that have german roots and dark haired people in the south ? 
  a country with hundreds of dialects and tens of different languages . 
  they speak germanic languages in aoste valley and greek languages in the south https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griko_dialect that 's homogenous to you ? 
  not sure what triggerd you , but yeah you 're triggered . 
  oh we deport them . 
  we just do n't bribe them to leave . 
  we used to give them 300 euros when they left ... for the inconveniece . 
  but that was before 2012, 
   at some point of the history , yes hey if we cherry pick enough we 'll get our homogenous societies . 
   it leaves a bad impression mate , tone down your arrogant attitude on topics you clearly are n't versed in . 
  no need to get salty . 
  you claimed :  bulgars , the people themselves have never been replaced from the land , merely conquered . 
  they are thracians with a different language and identity you claimed bulgars are thracians . 
   i wo n't bother giving you however numerous studies of the genetic of balkan people you can easily find online that show the extreme closeness of all balkan nations . 
  oh got a genetics person . 
  okay let 's dive in here . 
   the bulgarian people today are no different genetically than the population here for thousands of years , t did you check the title of the map ? 
  it says ** predominant ** haplogroup . 
  it 's not the distribution of the haplogroups , just the one that 's most predominant . 
  if one haplogroup is at 33 % while the others are at 30 % , 30 % and 7 % , they 'll show just the 33 % . 
  pretty ridiculous to ignore the 67 %  there is no genetic connection with turkic people , there is with all the other balkan people . 
  did you actually check the pie chart of haplogroups ? 
  because you 'll see that the greeks and turks are super close . 
  and you 'll see that both greeks , turks , bulgarians and romanians have a significant haplo group j. 
  so much for no connection with turkic people . 
  and as a side note , very little slavic . 
   of course i do do you really ? 
   strategically placed political correctness . 
  well let me help you while being also pc . 
  a french gypsy has a french citizenship meaning they 're in schengen and they can go to the us without a visa . 
  a romanian gypsy has a romanian citizenship meaning they 're not in schengen and they need a visa and pass interviews to go to the us . 
  that 's the difference . 
   well in a free travel union like the eu you understand what travel means right ? 
   diversity was actively cracked down upon so france was homogenous and we needed to crack down on diversity ; very interesting concept right there . 
  a country that has german dialects , catalan speakers , basque speakers , breton speakers ... is suddenly homogenous ? 
  a country where one of the group of people would constantly berate and insult other groups like the bretons was suddenly a bastion of homogenity ? 
  a country where corsicans want their independence ? 
  seems like you are cherry picking because you do n't like history . 
   poland you mean the region that had 10 % jewish not too long ago . 
  that 's homogenous for you ? 
   how is that a fact ? 
  i can give you even modern examples of homogenous societes . 
  have a go at it buddy boy . 
   most are breaking the law sauce for that . 
  thank you   45 % unemployment for the roma community , 16-64 age group taken into account - out of education . 
  how dare they be unemployed . 
   65 % roma community living in improper living conditions yeah . 
  the govt is n't providing social housing . 
     hmmm . 
  do n't discriminate over here . 
  please . 
  they 're all european gypsies . 
  do you understand the concept of french gypsies and the concept of romanian gypsies ? 
   where did i disagree with any of that ? 
  you state  bulgars , the people themselves have never been replaced from the land , merely conquered . 
  they are thracians with a different language and identity no . 
  bulgars are n't thracians . 
  they 're turkic . 
   he man who declared that there never were ( overwhelmingly ) homogenous societies historic facts bother you ? 
  bus arrived late ? 
  yeah i agree , we must halt the refugee intake . 
   they created the state , its culture , its language and writing , its identity . 
  here on this land . 
  it 's theirs . 
  & nbsp ;  bulgarian culture and identity is a mix of slavs and bulgars , the people themselves have never been replaced from the land , merely conquered . 
  they are thracians with a different language and identity & nbsp ;  i am polish a\u00efe . 
  no wonder you do n't know the history of bulgaria . 
  the bulgars that founded the first empire were a [ turkic people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgars ) . 
  they defeated with the help of the slavs constantine iv and formed their empire .
