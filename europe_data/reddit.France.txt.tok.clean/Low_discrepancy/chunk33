  the problem is it takes about 10 people to follow one guy . 
  there are 600 people that went to syria . 
  800 that wan na go . 
  you can see the problem . 
  unless we do some quick arresting : oh you joined isis did you ? 
  well we have a nice warm cell just for you alone that you can occupy for a long long long period , we wo n't solve these problems . 
   veryone would 've been complaining about the incompetence of the authorities again in a manner reminiscent of the disappearance of salah abdeslam . 
  how is no one complaining that the two most wanted men in belgium casually walked in a major airport with massive bombs and an ak ? 
   the fact that one of the terrorists used automatic weapons in a burglary back in 2010 dude , it was because he faced discrimination . 
  gah , heartless people . 
   exterminating islam . 
  why such an extreme action ? 
  why not simply monitor who enters your country ? 
  why not send to jail those that came back from syria ? 
   your country is in in state of emergency and people are protesting against it . 
  79 % are ok with the state of emergency . 
  http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/79-pourcents-francais-favorables-prolongation-etat-urgence-jerome-fourquet-2568017.html the french are stupid . 
   they sometimes make a mistake mistakes were made , lessons were learnt , innocents died . 
   it was rented by him , but under a false name . 
  did n't put his real name there , obviously . 
  i read that name in the press a couple of days ago . 
  their identities were fully known . 
   and they were looking for them , though did n't find them in time . 
  why did n't belgium go in the highest state of terrorist alert ? 
  we can resume this story in 3 phrases : ** the 2 most wanted men in belgium and europe took a taxi from the center of bruxelles to the airport . 
  they entered the airport with 2 big bags of explosives and an ak 47 and blew themselves up . 
  again , the most wanted men in belgium and europe . 
  ** belgium knew they were planning a terrorist attack since they caught their accomplice that told them ** they were planning a terrorist attack ** . 
  and still did n't go in the highest state of terrorist alert . 
  * hope for the best , plan for the worst * anything less than that is incompetence . 
  well when our some 1500 isis freedom fighters come back home , we will have a nice ol' time then . 
   and they already said they did n't planned to attack brusel but they had no other choice because they ran out of time . '', 
  first and foremost , ** that is a lie ** . 
  abdeslam said : http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2016/03/21/2308439-abdeslam-preparait-une-nouvelle-attaque-contre-la-ville-de-bruxelles.html you are staying bs . 
  ** abdeslam was planning an attack on bruxelles ** . 
   maybe because they wanted to keep low profile on it ? 
  what 's the point of having terrorism alerts if you always `` go on the low '' ? 
  belgium govt did n't go on the highest alert . 
  what did they expect ? 
  that they 'd make plans and not go with them because terrorists do n't terror ? 
  did they expect that they 'd wait until they get arrested ? 
  your logic makes no sense to me . 
  keep it on the low , wow . 
  they arrested a very important guy that said : `` yeah we 're planning terrorist attacks in belgium '' . 
  the guy was found in an apartment rented under the name of el bakraoui . 
  el bakraoui still was n't under arrest and never will be since he blew himself up . 
  the million dollar question : why did n't the belgian government put the country in the highest state of terrorist alert ? 
  well let 's roll out some facts . 
  * we have a terrorist cell that causes a massive terrorist act in paris . 
  very brutal . 
  * one of main people remaining is arrested after they check an apartment rented by someone named el bakraoui . 
  * that main dudre arrested says they were planning a terrorist strike in belgium . 
  * 4 days later , the el bakraoui brothers ** which were still in the wild ** blow themselves up . 
  what did the police expect they 'd do ? 
  what would you expect they 'd do ? 
  * wait until they get arrested or * go down with a bang . 
  personally , in the light of the paris attacks i would lean towards `` down with a bang '' . 
  the govt did n't call the highest state of terrorist attack so i think they leaned for '' wait until they get arrested '' . 
  * hope for the best , plan for the worst . 
  * we can play the over stretched game , but even the actions needed were not taken . 
  that being said , removing pressure in france and border controls would be a bad mistake . 
   the comparison would be with per capita per muslim citizen/inhabitant . 
  30 % of those who leave are muslim or smth like that . 
  but what you are saying muslims are a problem so mo ' muslims mo ' problems . 
  or we look at societal problems so per capita overall rate would make it a problem . 
  either way the message that / u/damir33 and / u/vujkepg try to send : that the west has some problems while the balkans is contradicted by facts . 
   you have millions of people who do n't want to see themselves as `` french '' where did you get that from bud ? 
  but nope , no problem at all , bud . 
  did i say there are no problems ? 
  i simply said you have big problems too . 
  larger than what you 'd want to make us believe . 
   worry more about the millions of unintegrated muslims in france rather than secular muslims in the balkans . 
  cheers . 
  dude do statistics bother you ? 
  it 's a fact . 
  bosnia and albania send waay waay more isis fighters per capita than france . 
  france sends 18 per million . 
  bosnia sends 92 per million and albania 48 . 
  i 'm sorry that does n't fit your secular narrative . 
  but thanks for selling aks to those terrorists in belgium . 
  super kind of you to supply them . 
   no , it 's not a `` moot point '' as these people live side by side with christians and others in the same neighborhoods and intermarry . 
  wow . 
  what a fucking success . 
  30 % of my colleagues at a top french engineering school were muslims . 
  big friggin deal . 
  do you believe it 's some kind of segregated society here in france ? 
  `` un integrated '' muslims . 
  what a joke . 
  omg christians marry muslims . 
  what a success , we have so much to learn from you . 
  yeah . 
  here no one does that . 
  we put our muslims in ghettos behind bars man in far away towns . 
  but they live together over there . 
  that 's unprecedented ... / s, 
   at the same time muslim leaders the world over will condemn the attack muslims leaders will come to the commemoration march and once the journals publish a new mohammed caricature they 'll flip their minds . 
  been there done that . 
  yes prosecuting for making a drawing isstupid . 
  romania lives in religious lala land where schools have icons of imaginary beings , religion classes are opt out and the church has waaay too much influence to the point of building a mega church .
