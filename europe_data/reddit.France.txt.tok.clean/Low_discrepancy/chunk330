  while the first ruler of the second bulgarian empire had [ vlach , bulgar and cuman origins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_ii_of_bulgaria ) . 
  cumans were also a turkic people . 
   we 're talking about washing yourself , holy fuck what 's with the ignoramuses here . 
  hurr durr gypsies dont waaash . 
   what i know your governments are paying gypsies to leave the country . 
  it 's good to know that you 're not only ignorant in gypsy matters . 
  you 're also ignorant in french matters . 
   with such conditions the conditions are for our own gypsies . 
  we 've got 500k french gypsies . 
  can you tell me how many french gypsies came to your country and caused problems there ? 
   you guys seem to have it all figured out over there i like how your solution to the problem seems to be : we 've made it so that it really sucks for roma to live here . 
  well it 's a bit harsh to say no one gives a fuck about romania . 
  we all know how rampant corruption is there . 
  i guess it 's the fault of the dirty gypsies too . 
  as a mix between slavs and turkic people , should n't you be in anatolia and the caucasian ? 
   basic laws then they should n't expect to have a `` place '' in our cities * 1 / what basic laws are n't they respecting ? 
  seems to me that the ** romanian govt did n't adhere to basic laws ** . 
  they rented out social housing without maintaining it . 
  they rented out social housing that became unfit for use . 
  * 2 / in france any town , city with over 5000 people must provide space in case gypsies with caravans want to pass through and stay a bit , like travellers do . 
  not saying all towns and cities respect this law but it exists and a lot do . 
  also social housing is up to snuff . 
  so i 'm confused here . 
  romania tried nothing and they ran out of ideas on how to deal with the roma problem ? 
  if all you 've got is a hammer , everything is a nail . 
  your football team lost ? 
  we must halt the refugee intake . 
  there 's no more milk in the fridge ? 
  we must halt the refugee intake . 
  stubbed your toe on the coffee table ? 
  we must halt the refugee intake . 
   it 's the power of the decision this agency hold that is at stake . 
  the agency is supposed to be independent of the country it is in . 
  if the country wants to use it as a measure of wielding power , the eu is very much fucked . 
   ing what we can to non-violently correct demographics what measures to `` correct '' demographics are you proposing ? 
   a less than 100 percent success rate is not evidence of a faulty system fine . 
  show me correlation between snooping and security . 
  if you want to implement a procedure , let 's see how valid it is . 
   if my choices are having my porn preferences snooped through by the government , or getting blown up next time i 'm on the metro , then by all means the government can go nuts . 
  so a country with a ton of snooping like the us sees no terrorist attacks ? 
  if you say so . 
   the one where people care more about security than freedom of religion meh . 
  we all have away our right to privacy for security . 
  what 's the final cost of that security if i 'm not too nosy . 
  maybe we can buy it online , might be cheaper ? 
  would you like your national symbols to be associated with ryanair ? 
   the harp being the main national symbol of ireland why does ryanair hate ireland so much then ? 
  it 's almost like it 's an extreme punishment . 
  i know ... crazy : o, 
  weird how i do n't see france in those examples . 
  you did n't give me examples of people that went to jail though : /, 
  all the ww1 vets died and i dislike canadian woodchoppers so yes !, 
  let 's get to it man . 
  also people who wear fedoras . 
  and people who try to enter the subway before you 've exited . 
  i hate those people . 
  how about we deport citizens that do n't shave their beard ? 
  you did n't tell me what procedure to check for radical islamists that wan na kill people . 
   man not shaking hands with women so deport citizens because the do n't wan na shake hands . 
  this makes sense to you ? 
   already jail people for wrongthink can you give me a few examples ? 
   i agree it would n't be perfect so your solution is to expulse citizens without any real basis and without them ever committing a crime but only on their perceived intentions . 
  this solution is dumb . 
  ** next **, 
   to expel anyone that wishes to remain fundamentalist muslim . 
  how do you identify a fundamentalist muslim that wants to kill people and how do you expel citizens of your own country ? 
  so what 's your solution ? 
   to begin with , that 's how you get `` winners keep winning , loosers keep loosing '' systems and over-centralization . 
  to be fair , this is just an agency , 890 jobs ... that 's peanuts . 
  it 's not ema that will make out of romania a winner or a loser . 
  i 'd say stuff like the eli is much more important . 
   having the regulator 's office workers have lunch right across the industry 's i 'm pretty sure underhand deals do n't happen over a work lunch . 
   our major economic engine in europe is a country who is heavily into decentralizing . 
  is n't romania suffering from extreme inequality due to excessive centralisation ? 
  bucharest 's gdp is friggin 2 times larger than the average gdp . 
  that 's huge and besides london , it 's probably one of the highest levels of inequality in europe . 
  since you 're complaining about centralization , how would putting ema in bucharest work towards solving the issue ? 
   actually , they have hope it will one day stop . 
    but until then ... partaaaay, 
   t ~ ~ h ~ ~ eor ( r ) ists this writing gave me cancer . 
   one of the two options ends with our people continuing to be killed every 48 hours . 
  oh you have a solution for the terrorism that is hitting europe ? 
  did it take you longer than solving cancer or not ? 
   very poor timing . 
  is there ever a good timing to say : you people will never be safe !, 
   people are suffering and frightened , and some are just glad at the opportunity to make a political point . 
  you must be new to reddit . 
  the amount of gloating , `` i 'm better than you because people were murdered in your country '' and rubbing it in your face from after terrorist attacks goes over the roof . 
   just speculating based on what lol . 
  how about you just wait before speculating . 
  well it 's not like we all remember that the brussels attack happened a year ago . 
   stromae he 's not french though . 
   she is a minor local performer that 's kinda the point of eurovision . 
  so you 're talking about stuff that is irrelevant to the article and thread ? 
  mkay, 
   if they are in the country illegally , nowhere does it say that they 're illegally in the country either . 
   his is something that should have been done on a yearly basis bunkers change significantly from one year to another ? 
   that is extremely worrying . 
  yes . 
  it 's a big bad scary cartoon :'(,
