  the embargo favoured the serbs and the croats . 
   left jna as the only prepared/functional army in ex-yugoslavia in the early 90 's are we forgetting that croatia also attacked the bosniaks ? 
  it 's interesting how it presents the different types of behaviours of the young maghrebins that are doing the their service ( some consider themselves french , others have issues with a defined personality , others seem too susceptible to comments ) . 
  it also talks about the different expectations that this induce ( some expect the army to give them a job at the end , other want it to be the final proof that yeah they 're indeed french , some want to be treated equally others want to have their diversity respected ) . 
  and sometimes they compare it with the expectations of the military ( the army does n't really inform the muslims about their rights with can make it seem that they 're discriminated against , at the time they did n't really serve halal food etc. , it also recognizes that some military have a difficulty dealing with maghrebins , are judgemental , there was n't any imams back then but there were priests and jewish rabbis etc ) i think the short report is quite interesting and it kinda shows that the army is n't an easy place . 
  the young people coming in have certain expectations , the army that manages them focuses a lot on quick results and might not have the eagerness to iron out integration issues because that 's not exactly their job . 
   what facts exactly ? 
  http://www.ina.fr/video/cab90028763 http://www.persee.fr/doc/homig_1142-852x_1990_num_1138_1_2855 here are facts . 
  national service did n't work in 1990 , it did n't create unity , it did n't help integration . 
   it come back regularly during the elections ...   no it does n't . 
  sarkozy did n't mention it in 2007 . 
  hollande did n't in 2012 . 
   poor and rich shared the same experience without any regard on their background , and a lot of people liked that idea ... 
  even in 1990 we knew that the `` integration '' thanks to the national service was bs http://www.ina.fr/video/cab90028763, 
   it could improve national unity that 's for the propaganda . 
  but what about the actual facts ? 
   then why even do it at all ? 
  beats me . 
  got ta seem tough on those youngsters that have it too good ? 
  `` joker '' it 's for people that make shitty pranks that can go wrong . 
   i was quoting the bbc article . 
  well take news that drop so quickly with a pinch of salt . 
  he did n't even have a fiche s. 
   how can he just take the gun ? 
  apparently he did n't . 
  he tried to get it but did n't manage , said the interieur minister le roux . 
  you 're claiming he was on a watch list . 
  no we has n't since the fiche s is n't a watch list . 
  but hey it 's your right to remain ignorant . 
   i love that you 're deflecting the salt to me   top bants mate very relevant comment , very useful to the debate . 
  is this the famous british debating culture ? 
   why are you taking it as a personal attack seems that you 're taking is personal . 
   and a response of where isis fighters come from is n't the same as where attacks are happening so if isis people kill others in syria that 's nonyaproblem but if they do it in europe that 's a big problem ? 
  i 'd say that every time a european kills someone , that 's a big problem . 
  no need to get salty about this shit . 
  we 've all failed . 
   i never said britain was perfect but if you consider that having a brit go and join a terrorist group as worst than having trucks plow into people then be my guest so if one of your british chops off heads in syria that 's peachy . 
  but if a terrorist attack happens in europe ermeergeeerd !, 
   he was on a watch list of radicalised people . 
  he was crazy , but was n't just ` some dude ' . 
  dude if after all this type you do n't know what a fiche s is , i 'll help you . 
  he was ** not on a watch list ** . 
  fiche s does n't mean you get surveillance on you constantly . 
  there are 10000 people with a fiche s. http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2015/08/31/terrorisme-peut-on-sanctionner-les-personnes-faisant-l-objet-d-une-fiche-s_4741574_4355770.html it 's a list of people the secret services might think you 're a danger . 
  it does n't mean you 'll get arrested or anything . 
  and the most useful thing about it is when you do identity controls , that 's basically why it exists . 
  it can include hooligans , anarchists that caused problems etc etc. 
   more of a problem for these countries mkay https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jihadi_john http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11660487/islamic-state-one-year-on-where-do-its-fighters-come-from.html seems that it 's a bigger problem in uk than in germany . 
  but that 's alright . 
  we all know uk is perfect , 
   and poor security planning/training allowed him to grab a gun yeah shit happens . 
  calm down it happens everywhere . 
  the brits shot a guy that [ was simply running away ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_jean_charles_de_menezes#shooting_2 ) . 
   they can look over the water and see the results of when these efforts fail . 
  in the us ? 
   not trying to create a dick measuring contest but france ( and germany ) really need to improve their intelligence and domestic security . 
  neah , no dick measuring , you 're just ignorant . 
  this is just some crazy dude . 
     what 's the highest degree in biology that you obtained ? 
   so a social construct has made 10 % of `` europeans '' god why did i bother with people like you ? 
   someone needs to shut this research down , it seems racist . 
  what 's the highest degree in biology that you obtained ? 
   what 's a european ? 
  i thought race was a social construct exactly . 
  for example , americans did n't consider italians to be white for example . 
  and now americans consider people from north africa , middle east and europe to be white . 
  very scientific is n't it ? 
  economy should be picking up . 
   birthrate of turkish women in germany is 1.87 but but muh grand remplacement :(, 
   seems to be a reasonable solution at each step . 
  the problem with gradient descent algorithms . 
  the party that calls a ban on building minarets and made [ this poster ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/lead_image_svp.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all ) is n't far right ? 
  has a leader involved in [ antisemitic rants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christoph_blocher#controversies ) yeah ... riiight . 
   the oligarchy is really going out on an all media war to win fillon just received as gift 2 suits that cost ** 13000 ** euros . 
  nice to know he 's not connected to the oligarchy . 
  what a relevant and useful comment . 
   all they would like you to do would be to work in an office for some other already rich guys till you are old as fuck . 
  yes i 'm sure in the us no one wishes to work for google , fb , apple , gs , jp morgan , exxon . 
  to each their own , i do n't get this attitude of spite against people that wan na work in big groups . 
  big groups offere certain opportunities start-ups can not and it 's silly to ignore that . 
  why is the title editorialised ? 
   there are advantages and disadvantages everywhere . 
  exactly and it 's up to each and every society to make their choices . 
  i do n't understand why people want to transform every country according to one single model . 
   so , i think its not the best idea to compare how hard someone works based on the hours they work . 
  fine , then let 's look at productivity gdp ppp/hour worked . 
  well it seems that the us and germany [ have the same productivity rates ] ( http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/files/2017/01/pikettybloglemonde03012017dataf1f9fr_page_7-768x543.jpg ) so no , one does n't stay with their dick in their hands while the other work their asses off . 
   become a buchhalter and work your ass off till you die . 
  [ germans work ** 400 ** fewer hours per year than americans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_time ) i would n't call that working your ass off [ they also retire at 65 and 3 mo compared to the us ' 66 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retirement_age ) . 
  the german life expectancy is [ 81 vs 79.3 for americans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy ) i would n't call that working till you die either . 
  in fact , if we do the maths , the average american works ** 30 % more ** per year , retires 9 months after and dies 1.7 years before the average german . 
   we do n't want to end up like greece . 
  in what way would poland become a new greece . 
  that seems like poor economics . 
   someday and this is why a two speed europe is a good thing . 
   but on more fundamental issues . 
  yeah too many eastern europeans . 
   why would it stay ? 
  well when poland joined , it knew that the euro existed and it 's supposed to join . 
  when will poland join the euro ?
