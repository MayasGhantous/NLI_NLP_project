  does it have a road map ? 
  any projections other than sometimes in the future ? 
   poland does n't owe you anything . 
  poland should stop shooting itself in the foot . 
   its a experiment . 
  [ gone sexual ] [ gone wrong ] in the hood  to see if you could bring a country to the same level as the other western european states by giving them a lot of cash . 
  in 15 years we 'll get to see if an economy that 's brought to the level of western europe actually wants to remain in the eu . 
  we 're very scientific people . 
   done exactly because a majority of scots do not want another referendum how do you know that ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that you favor parliament being the highest authority . 
  and as such the scottish parliament should decide if and when to have a ref . 
  or should countries be led by polls and not parliaments ? 
   so no ... it 's not about fondly remembering the nazis , this is not a type of '' victory day '' event like in russia or something , it has completely different meaning and mentality that outsiders cant understand if they do n't understand our culture . 
  it 's cultural guys . 
  you simply would n't understand . 
  are you sure you people are n't related to the japanese ? 
   v4 are in eu and i 'm talking about eu ? 
  so is estonia in the eu . 
  how can estonia stop islamic terrorism in western europe . 
   i do n't think he got a permit for his rifle . 
  he could have gotten a rifle from his parents entourage . 
  the point is that it 's not incredibly difficult to get a gun or a hunting rifle . 
  how much salt can we collect from / r/t _ w ? 
  how is v4 relevant to the discussion ? 
  you made a stupid comment , own up to it . 
  yeah . 
  but the media might have an impact on why these acts are happening . 
   people hunt with grenades in france ? 
  are you involved in the case to know what type of grenade the dude was using ? 
  could be anything from a shitty home made plaster grenade , or a frag grenade . 
   is `` imported '' and could be cut off if eu had will , that 's one stupid comment . 
  the type of `` will '' you 're mentioning would only lead to more terrorism . 
   at least nowadays movies , books and videogames are n't blamed anymore by every media outlet ... 
  someone in the police said that he was watching school shooting videos . 
   how did he even get a gun ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country france has high gun ownership about 30 per 100 people . 
  and the region here is very close to the alps and natural parks so people tend to hunt a lot . 
   does n't exactly look like your average school shooting either . 
  are you sure about [ that ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/columbine_shooting_security_camera.jpg ), 
   they did vote against the eu well they 're not in the eu and recently they had no join the eu ref . 
  so i 'm not sure what you 're talking about . 
   in the referendum to join the eu/euro , the eu is n't the euro and you 're for all intended purposes in the eu . 
   switzerland 's manufacturing is so expensive ( due to currency/high salary levels ) and high-end that additional tariffs are unlikely to have any substantial effects on exports i like claims that involve accounting where no numbers are presented . 
  all based on feelings . 
  heard the same from brexiters . 
   you do realize that i 'm french too ? 
   for a very advanced economy we could do better to fend off corruption : bof , corruption ** perception ** index . 
   does n't do much other than bitch about how the world will end if we leave schengen . 
  landlocked country surrounded by eu countries which are also the biggest trade partners . 
  neah ... i 'm sure you 'll do juuuust fine all alone . 
  cern might need to move a little bit because going through customs is n't that fun and switzerland only constributes 3.3 % of its budget . 
   since ferrari is controlled by fiat . 
  actually it 's not . 
   i think public funds embezzlement is a very latin disease bullshit . 
  emirates arena cost [ 390 million pounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emirates_stadium ) . 
  millenium dome cost [ 1.2 billion pounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_dome ) . 
  esprit arena : [ 240 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esprit_arena ) stop the circlejerk about how crooked us latin we are . 
   one could have thought the romanians might have learned something from the palatul parlamentului we spent [ ** 1.6 billion euros ** ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/france/2016/06/10/les-tres-chers-stades-de-l-euro-2016_1458439 ) from public funds on a bunch of stadium . 
  are we really the ones to judge ? 
  heck , allianz arena in nice cost ** 50 ** million more that this church that is meant to be the main cathedral of their religion . 
  i do n't know about you but i do n't feel ogc nice is the main football team in france . 
   how the romanian state could do a better use of their money instead of partly funding such gigantic church ... that 's kind of a silly argument . 
  romania built their main stadium and it end up costing 30 million more than this [ church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arena_na%c8%9bional%c4%83 ) . 
  the funding for that came fully from public funds . 
  honestly , nowadays it seems that you can not build any big structure without spending 200 million . 
  allianz arena in nice : [ 250 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allianz_riviera ) - mind you , it 's some 30 % smaller than romania 's stadium , nouveaux stade de bordeaux : [ 168 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nouveau_stade_de_bordeaux ) , stade pierre mauroy : [ 282 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stade_pierre-mauroy ) . 
  if you wan na embark on a big project , shit seems to cost a lost of money nowadays . 
  the church just got 10 feet higher . 
   yep , would very happy to . 
  your fellow citizens do n't seem so keen about that little thing . 
  it 's almost like you 're not the only citizen in switzerland . 
  i know ... it 's a very weird feeling knowing you 're not the only person in the universe . 
   there is also a question if germans trust others with with enforcing the standards . 
  [ i feel i must appologise for the high standards my nation is applying ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwezt9p5scm ) . 
  next you 'll tell us how strong german banking regulations are ? 
  i do n't feel i can trust german authorities to check that german car makers are applying said strong standards . 
   got ta love people who say they disagree but do n't state their reasoning . 
  we 'll look at his flair , check his country 's birth rate and try to figure out why in france we 're doing much better than in germany ( that has the same birth rates as friggin japan ) . 
   would kill all villagers if single one would help nazis would kill a whole village if a jews was found being helped to hide ? 
  do you have any sources for that ? 
  so no ferrari ff ? 
  countless sidewalks are expected to turn green too , right ? 
  [ nuff said ] ( http://www.helmut-kohl.de/hp_images/galerien_biographie_neu/internationale_beziehungen/prev_14.jpg ), 
  did you actually bother reading the pdf / u/alxzen66 posted ? 
  sounds like your run of the mill brexiter talking points :  the uk can offer either to carry forward current tariff free trade with service sector passports , or to fall back on the world trade organisation standard tariff trade . 
  the uk would recommend the former , but could live with the latter . 
  rather than negotiate , it is just a question of which the rest of the eu will choose . 
  whilst the eu commission is likely to threaten the imposition of wto rules , the member states are likely to opt for the status quo of tariff free trade given business lobbies in their own countries . 
  yeah uk will just present their offers and the eu can either accept or not . 
  no skin off uk 's back . 
  hahaha . 
  also the eu will certainly accept status quo . 
   the balance of trade and tariff rates under wto rules is more damaging to the rest of the eu than to the uk , given the uk 's bias to services which are all tariff free , and given the devaluation of the pound which has already made rest of the eu products less price competitive without extra tariffs . 
  well of course uk has the upper hand , anyone 's stupid not to see that . 
   he pointed out that the article 50 two-year period is a maximum period for negotiations -- unless all 28 states want to take longer -- but there is no reason why it need take that long . 
  of course there is no reason . 
  i have no facts to base on why there 's no reason , but yeah believe me . 
  there is no reason . 
   there was a general welcome for the idea that the uk should be willing to participate in many research projects and funding schemes without being an eu member . 
  no shit .
