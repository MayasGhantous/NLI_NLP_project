   a common myth is that the single market has predefined rules that are immutable ; there is no such thing as a clearly defined single market distinct from the eu at large . 
  i heard many a brexiter say that . 
  and the answer from merkel ? 
  [ nein ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/merkel-no-single-market-without-free-movement-for-eu-citizens-10723535 )  by ruling out free movement of labour , we have closed off the unattractive option of joining the eea . 
  so then the myth of a single market is n't exactly a myth . 
  color me surprised . 
   the value of passporting rights , though worth keeping , should not be exaggerated . 
  yeah of course . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : after reading 6 pages quickly , uk totally has the upper hand and even if they get no deal , that 's totally fine . 
  no biggie . 
   i find this odd , are we expected to cherish losing most of our country ? 
  and this is why a project like the european union could never have come from eastern europe . 
  `` you mean i got ta be allies now with the people that occupied my country and wanted to annex parts of it ? '', 
   to get a fair comparison to the us . 
  any comparison with the us would be on an individual basis . 
   minimum wage in massachusetts is $ 11 per hour and $ 5.15 in wyoming . 
  fine then take the minimum wage in luxembourg which is 1998.59 and the minimum wage in bulgaria which is 235.20 . 
  heck back in 2015 when the minimum was 216 euros , 30 % of romanians were living on minimum wage . 
   we might be worse than the us if the s80/s20 comparison would compare the top 20 % eu citizens to the bottom 20 % eu citizens , regardless of their residency . 
  why would you do that ? 
  it would make no sense . 
  minimum wage in romania is 320 euros , while it 's 1400 euros in france . 
   it 's a mess for all concerned . 
  i 'm sure multinationals love it though . 
  i thought nato was the organisation that deals with military issues . 
  well surely once everybody reaches 2 % , russia will give south ossetia back . 
   even when they effectively fight everybody including isis , for example ftfy, 
  so not every christian society then ? 
  so political campaigns are big troll fests and you should make comments only if it gets a reaction ? 
  how interesting and useful, 
  at times the debate will be passionate but nuanced and we 'll learn many a thing about history , religion etc, 
  we do n't deport our citizens :( sux i knows . 
   it 'd be like saying `` we ca n't have a justice system , since people who commit crimes would never choose to identify themselves '' . 
  a justice system = innocent until proven guilty . 
   and accepting a certain error rate where some who have committed crimes will escape punishment and some who have not will be punished . 
  again , only ** 1 ** terrorist was non european . 
  so i fail to see what significant criteria one could propose to weed that particular guy . 
   rejecting people who get entry to france in order to lower the rate of violence . 
  of all the terries that attacked in france , only 1 was non european ( 2 others were syrians/iraki but they blew themselves up in an alley ) . 
  so what criteria are you suggesting ? 
   although it was a guy dressed as a woman that claims to identify as a woman . 
  did he say he identified as a woman or was he simply a crossdresser ? 
   or you could just stop letting people into europe who carry out attacks like this sadly they refuse to declare when they enter if they 're willing to carry out attacks or not : s, 
  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/gang-found-guilty-of-uks-largest-known-gun-smuggling-operation  a british crime gang bought the largest haul of automatic weapons ever detected by police on the uk mainland from the same source in eastern europe as terrorists behind the paris attacks of january 2015 , it can be revealed . 
   he did n't control it and could n't get control of it so he did n't give anything away . 
  again why did he feel the need to draft that agreement if he has no control ? 
  you fail to understand how he completely fucked any negociation capability the us might have had . 
  the poor fat fuck acted without telling anything to the americans . 
  stalin performed divide et impera to perfection . 
   while the stricter rules for deactivation is literary the only peace of the passed legislature that nobody has any problems with . 
  i 've seen people here comment that terrorists bought their guns on the black market . 
  that was false . 
   cheers, 
   truck attacks have more victims per one terrorist than firearms . 
  yeah and on the promenade in nice they put metal barriers so trucks ca n't pass . 
  see ... change , 
   possible due to outdated slovakian legislation ah okay so it 's just slovakians ? 
  i saw this on the bbc and thought you should see it : pictured : huge weapons haul seized by spanish police - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39264664 are these 10k guns all from just slovakia ? 
   what 's there not to get ? 
  you 're telling me that this type of law wo n't stop terrorism . 
  but i 've gave you examples upon examples of people that have obtained guns that were improperly de-activated . 
  how can you claim that creating an eu wide standard of deactivation that is irreversible would not impact gun trafficking ? 
  are you absolutely sure all the other 27 states have deactivation standards that would render every weapon impossible to activate ? 
  dude i 'm explaining you that churchill ** gave away ee without ** us approval . 
  it was fucking crass to decide the fate of entire countries on one piece of paper . 
  the fact that us and the ussr completely defanged uk ( and france ) during the suez invasion was a good thing . 
  we finally became irrelevant on the international scene after so much crap we pulled . 
  i like how you assume that the eu would still be a thing if france exists . 
   ( illegally ) re-activated firearms how is it possible to reactivate weapons that have been deactivated ? 
  do you have any relevant comments or do you enjoy trolling ? 
  do you have any relevant comments besides trolling ? 
   meanwhile france undermined nato . 
  percentage agreement : oct 1944 nato : 1949 where did get your history lessons ? 
   the shoddy slovakian deactivation was banned later that year well / u/petr0101 is bitching about how the czechs will hate the eu even more . 
  sad . 
  yet we have no comment on the slovak guns that were used to kill people . 
  slovakian secret services have no possible way of determining how many weapons caches there are out there in the wild . 
  slovakia did n't close the loophole for a very long time it just benefitted from these kind europeans coming to buy these guns . 
  do you really want us to think that the people who were selling those guns had no ideas how easy it is to reactivate them ? 
  only the baddies knew ? 
  where 's the hate for that criminal irresponsibility from slovakian authorities ? 
  polxit , 
   a deactivated gun is a prop , a toy . 
  well people got lead poisoning from those toys . 
  so they generously offered their agreement ? 
  how kind :'), 
   i am giving a fair analysis . 
  should i cite you again ? 
   this will do jack shit to prevent terrorism . 
   make a law concerning deactivated guns and real guns and then you have a problem to the point where i do n't give a shit about the original issue . 
  fine . 
  just do n't pretend you 're giving a fair analysis and do n't get pissed when your bs is called out on . 
   to real guns i 'll assume that a gun that was used to kill people is `` a real gun '' . 
  it was n't a finger gun was it . 
   gain , nobody protest against more restrict deactivation laws oh really ? 
  but he polish that actually fought in the rfa and built the first enigma cracking computer ? 
  fuck them . 
   no , you are just using the excuse that deactivated guns should be more restricted no . 
  i am calling bullshit where i see it . 
  and i 've seen it here .
