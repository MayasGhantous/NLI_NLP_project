  you claiming that this law will have no impact on terrorism . 
  / u/petr0101 claiming that terrorist [ only buy guns on the black market . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zbyj3/parliament_approves_revised_eu_gun_law_to_close/deww0h1/ ) so they wo ` nt be affected . 
  / u/arnold _ layne claiming that this law will have no impact on terrorism . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zbyj3/parliament_approves_revised_eu_gun_law_to_close/deww1q8/ / u/k890 claims that these guns are all from the black market . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zbyj3/parliament_approves_revised_eu_gun_law_to_close/dex09xc/ only / u/legalassassin _ swe mentions that yeah some loopholes are indeed closed . 
  he dislikes other parts of the law . 
  if you want to be fair , you should take what is good and say yeah this is good , and what you think is pointless , you say it 's crap . 
  but when you and several others say that this law is an utter turd and wo n't do `` jack shit for terrorism '' , we both know that it 's a lie . 
   problem was n't with better pan-european gun deactivation standards , well / u/zorthianator is constantly bitching about this law . 
  and at no point do i see him mention that stronger standards on deactivation need to be implemented . 
  after i called him out , did he start to say : okay yeah deactivation laws need to be stricter . 
   that various governments fail when young guys start radicalize and start plan terrorist attacks https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/gang-found-guilty-of-uks-largest-known-gun-smuggling-operation here 's a crime gang that smuggles guns into the uk from ... you guessed it * slovakia * damn radical islamists . 
   you would agree on full nazi or full communist country because majority of french would want it ? 
  yes . 
  i heard the constitution of weimar germany or the constitution of czarist russia really helped . 
  lel  what if people like you were targeted , persecuted or even exterminated ? 
  what if random people get sent to a random island to be tortured , waterboarded , etc ? 
  yeah i kinda think that a constitution wo n't help me much . 
  you are claiming that this law will do nothing to prevent terrorism . 
  and i called bullshit . 
  this is one of the things this law includes :  the revised directive also strengthens the rules on marking firearms and clarifies the status of `` deactivated '' weapons ( newly deactivated guns will have to be declared to national authorities ) . 
  following pressure from parliament , the eu commission pledged to adopt , by the end of may 2017 and in collaboration with national experts , revised deactivation standards and techniques for ensuring that deactivated firearms are rendered irreversibly inoperable . 
   it wo n't help fighting terrorism because terrorists buy all equipment on the black market , what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/gang-found-guilty-of-uks-largest-known-gun-smuggling-operation http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11420946/charlie-hebdo-shootings-automatic-rifles-used-in-paris-attacks-traced-to-shop-in-slovakia.html see [ this photo ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/01/08/09/charlie%20hebdo%20killers%20policemanv1.jpg ) . 
  that ak pointed to the policeman 's head , about to get executed . 
  you see it ? 
  that ak comes from * slovakia * , bought as a `` deactivated '' gun . 
  instead of talking bullshit , why not admit that slovakia fucked up by selling guns that could be easily reactivated . 
  i 'll take my chances . 
  uk is not exactly like france , where the police come and arrest you cuz they did n't like your tweets . 
  but thank you for presenting us other examples of beautiful free speech https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/03/four-chelsea-fans-to-go-on-trial-over-paris-metro-racism :'), 
   are going to hate eu for a bit more . 
  maybe if your former bro slovakia did n't bother to sell rifles to terrorists that could be easily reactivated , you would n't be in this shit . 
  they can come and take my guns . 
   this will do jack shit to prevent terrorism . 
  seems to me slovakia has problems with its deactivation of rifles . 
   `` security loopholes '' ... yeah , right . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11420946/charlie-hebdo-shootings-automatic-rifles-used-in-paris-attacks-traced-to-shop-in-slovakia.html https://www.wsj.com/articles/slovakia-shop-believed-to-be-source-of-guns-in-two-french-terror-attacks-1448629216 i 'm sorry . 
  you were saying ? 
  from the article  the revised directive also strengthens the rules on marking firearms and clarifies the status of `` deactivated '' weapons ( newly deactivated guns will have to be declared to national authorities ) . 
  following pressure from parliament , the eu commission pledged to adopt , by the end of may 2017 and in collaboration with national experts , revised deactivation standards and techniques for ensuring that deactivated firearms are rendered irreversibly inoperable . 
   and if le pen wins in france the same mechanism can be used to keep quiet other gits . 
  if a majority of french want to change the law , then so be it . 
   yeah - but we stopped fighting those borders still pretty shitty of uk to split europe in spheres of influence . 
  i 'll protest laws i wan na change . 
  like you know ... how it logically works . 
   i 'm also paying taxes in eu , just like many many millions of other people the many millions of europeans have decided to not pay that git . 
  that 's it boys . 
  break her legs !, 
   the precedent is the problem . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39152562 guy was already fined before . 
  him and another were fined for doing a nazi salute . 
  there 's rules and regulations even in the european parliament and no it did n't turn into a commie censurised den . 
   i guess voltaire words where does voltaire say that i have to pay the guy to spew bullshit ? 
   typical french nationalist : kinda ironic when you also said this https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5z0ja8/the_latest_french_candidate_macron_condemns_turkey/deucuny/ i 'll just tag you as salty , 
   imo no speech should be disallowed unless it calls for direct action to perform acts of violence . 
  that 's nice . 
  * 1 / why do n't you start a political party then to change the laws . 
  * 2 / why do n't you move to the us where they 're more accepting to your views regarding free speech ? 
  the problem would be immediatly solved . 
  people who like it here , stay here , people who do n't , leave . 
   try again . 
  someone who claims great success at the city but does n't know who introduced the pricing methods for ir options . 
  neah . 
  you 're too succesful  ), 
   what about french french guiana ? 
  what 's your citizenship ? 
  not french ? 
  then do n't tell my country what to do with its territory . 
  cheerio . 
  honestly all threads related to refugees on / r/europe are shitshows and extensions of / r/european or other extreme right bullshit . 
  i admire anyone that has to guts to take on the specimens seen here . 
  not guts as in strength but guts as in capability to hold their food down . 
   no , i used to work in the city . 
  the city still needs hr . 
  and you were most likely bad at that job too . 
  many parts of the city was built by students and by reseach produced by nek or geman . 
   where i could justify paying someone more because they output more no one contradicts you here . 
  and we can talk about how foxconn and other big industrial giants that prefer to hire women because they can focus better , easier to manage and more dependable than men . 
  that 's neither here nor there . 
  these are jobs do n't pay well at all . 
   how many women are qualified/capable for those ? 
  3 % at best . 
  i see you work in hr . 
  you 're salty against women cuz a ton of them are your coworkers ? 
   what a victory for the eu parliament !, 
  indeed . 
  my tax money should n't go to this douchebag 's pockets . 
   i n't no way a twiggy blonde mary unpacks palettes of stuff as fast as beef swoleson . 
  those jobs usually do n't pay the most , 
  that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  god job european parliament . 
   so are cows . 
  whales as intelligent as cows ? 
  where the hell did you get that ? 
   the killing of one pregnant whale as ` two whales ' oh man . 
  i can already hear the pro-lifers, 
   to all expressions of religion actually all expressions of religion , philosophical , political ideas etc.
