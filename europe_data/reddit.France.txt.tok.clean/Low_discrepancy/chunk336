   as long as you are banning `` symbols '' then people should just ban what they see things as symbols . 
    i want to ban all symbols of the extremist far-right parties in europe . 
  pvv fn etc. 
  all fascists need to be banned . 
  ** holy fuck did you read the rulling ? 
  ** http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-03/cp170030en.pdf it 's in the ** fucking title ** :  an internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political , philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination, 
   but what 's to stop campaigners putting pressure on companies to stop allowing the wearing of headscarves . 
  well the rulling says it must appl to all religions and not just muslims . 
   look it up , people have argued exactly that . 
  no offense dude , but you sound liek trump and his muslim ban . 
  to paraphrase : i have friends from that community that have called me and told me , donald , you 're right , there 's a deep problem . 
  you 're the media , you should check this out . 
  many , many people agree with me . 
  now i do n't mean to doubt your honesty , but c'mon man . 
  it 's not hard to make a little girl believe that there 's an imaginary man up in the sky that cares deeply about hair . 
  two opposing views are clashing : egalitarianism vs libertarianism , it 's pretty clear that europe is on one side of the aisle . 
  that photoshop doe . 
  why did n't they stage live photoshoots, 
   you 're going to need to step one higher than that . 
  you want me to read this :  chapter i : purposes and principles and  to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace ; can you point to me where it says :  right to self determination like the exact phrase you 're quoting . 
  because it seems like they 're really striving to not call it a right , but a principle . 
   un right to self determination http://www.un.org/press/en/2012/gashc4051.doc.htm press release irrelevant . 
   http://www.unpo.org/article/4957 i 'll give you a quote from this press release :  the principle of self-determination is prominently embodied in article i of the charter of the united nations . 
  earlier it was explicitly embraced by us president woodrow wilson , by lenin and others , 
  i 'll give you a call when we 'll have a problem with them syrians . 
  up to now , none . 
  thanks for caring . 
   duh , you want to run the eu in factually democratic way ? 
  i 'm sorry but since the syrian refugee problem is not a french problem , then i do n't see why france should have a say in this issue . 
  unless they promised visas for turkey or whatever , i do n't really care . 
  eu should n't just be centralisation centralisation centralisation . 
  i see it as a regional issue mostly . 
  just like, 
  i see your finland and raise you [ france ] ( http://img.20mn.fr/r_y0qq09tpyx5j2c3we_wg/648x415_20mn-40404.jpg ), 
  can some do the maths on this thing ? 
  because apparently this will produce [ 4.8 gigawatts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogger_bank_wind_farm ) . 
  which is a fair amount , but that 's the same amount the [ one nuclear plant can produce in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cattenom_nuclear_power_plant ) . 
  and one nuclear plant ** can not ** supply energy for 80 million people . 
  so what gives ? 
  the title seems ** very ** misleading . 
  so the european version of american pie is german beach ? 
  who authorised you to mess up the meme ? 
  speak for yourself !, 
   if so how fast is fast ? 
  they 're scottish for fucks sake , do you even need to ask ? 
  [ they 'll go ` to plaid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7vwcuvof0&amp;t=2m22s ), 
   if we are so bad , stupid and ungrateful why wo n't you give us independence ? 
  maybe just like us europeans with the eu , he has a dream of unity :'), 
   1664 that number speaks to me and i do n't know why . 
  nope . 
  trump admin is waking up . 
  :d what new wacky adventures will we see today ? 
  obama was spying on trump by hacking his toaster ? 
  trump spends another 10 million dollars from us funds at his hotel in palm beach ? 
  trump tries for the 3rd time his muslim ban ? 
  the wall gets 30 ft taller ? 
   nice misdirection though . 
  oh the misdirection is all from the previous dude who wants to claim that self-determination is a right like freedom of speech or assembly which are personal freedoms . 
  in reality some concept of freedom of self-determination does exist but its explicit implementation ( unlike what you or other people here think ) it is not really that clear . 
  what seems clear is that unilateral self-determination which amounts to secession is not at all well viewed and the vast majority of countries disagree with it . 
  now if the majority decides to let you have a ref , sure , knock yourself out . 
  but if by your own , you decide okay guys i 'm leaving ... you need some very serious reasons for that to happen . 
  and shouting seeelf determination ya basterds ... well that 's going to get you as far as shouting heil hitler in germany and claiming you 've got freedom of speech . 
   ireland is already worried about the uk and uk is worried about leaving the eu . 
  and the eu is worried about uk leaving and scotland is worried about leaving the uk and uk is worried about scotland leaving . 
  of course . 
  for unilateral self-determination . 
  dude i would really like to see that charter . 
  can you link it . 
  i am only half sarcastic . 
  better nuke this convo again because you can not stop insulting others . 
   fuck me i 've got higher standards than that . 
   go learn what `` rights '' and `` freedom '' mean . 
  well you 'd be surprised to learn that there are n't any universal rights to unilateral self-determination which amounts to secession . 
  the nation of venice might not be allowed to secede . 
   do you understand why the uk gave scotland a referendum ? 
  calm down of you 'll get pissed like the last time buddy . 
   law denies the right to self determination . 
  it 's like denying other human rights like freedom of speech or assembly . 
  ok buddy , here ya go . 
  show me where the right to self-determination is in the udhr . 
  http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/  denying them the right to self-determination is oppressing them . 
  that 's not how it works since there 's no universal right for self-determination . 
  sux, 
   huh , til math can be racist . 
  nope . 
  your presentation of facts has a racist bias . 
  why ? 
  * 1 / instead of giving raw numbers you give a range . 
  `` germany has a fertility rates of 1.3-1 .9 '' germany has a fertility rate of ** 1.38 ** https://www.google.fr/search?q=fertility+rate+germany&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=sslgwjufjkozjwsozr94 poland has a fertility rate of ** 1.3 ** . 
  https://www.google.fr/search?num=30&amp;q=fertility+rate+poland&amp;oq=fertility+rate+poland&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30k1l2.82401.83050.0.83931.6.6.0.0.0.0.85.368.5.5.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..1.5.364.wguctxafsgg how do you explain that a country with 5 % muslims has the same fertility rate with a country that has 0 % muslims but a country with 7.5 % muslims has vastly higher birth rates . 
  * 2 / your mathematics is utterly wrong . 
  https://www.ined.fr/fr/tout-savoir-population/memos-demo/faq/fecondite-france-sans-immigres/ the birth rate in france is 2.0 . 
  without immigrants it would be 1.9 . 
   does that mean that they should have never gotten a referendum ? 
  scotland gets a ref if the uk parliament decides to give them a ref . 
  if the uk parliament does n't want to give them a ref , scotland has to show that they have good reason to not respect the law of the land . 
   why is that in any way a requirement ? 
  because the vast amount of constitutions declare that countries are indivisible , and the same goes for spain . 
  the spanish constitutional court has declared a catalan ref unconstitutional so the catalans need some pretty strong arguments for why they wish to not respect the constitution .
