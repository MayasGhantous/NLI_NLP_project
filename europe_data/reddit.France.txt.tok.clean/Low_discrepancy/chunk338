  http://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/world/europe/mark-rutte-netherlands-muslim-immigrants-trump.html https://www.wsj.com/articles/dutch-leader-takes-populist-turn-to-fend-off-far-right-party-1489314781 seems like it does though   , i think it 's more about the turkish government trying to ignore the dutch one , while being in the netherlands of course it 's a complicated issue . 
  but i do n't think anyone handled it particularly well . 
  you have serious self confidence issues if your pride hinges in whether some turks are allowed to gather up in a city in the north of france of not . 
  so unemployment , state of the economy , dwindling influence in europe , terrorism ... those are n't the topics people will vote on ? 
  people will just care about the fact that some turks held a rally in metz ? 
  as a frenchman , allow me to doubt that . 
  wednesday netherlands has elections and well wilders is n't doing too shabby so rutte is forced to go hunting on extreme right territory . 
  this is the result : yurop stronk, 
  smth smth not a monarchy . 
  so you 're saying we should kill these sorcerers ? 
  who the heck says thank you darling at the border police ? 
  when hollande gave a 20 billion tax break to companies , i did n't hear you people complain . 
   it was n't the people who decided to join https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 alternative history ? 
   who even managed to sell an illegal war war is the easiest thing to sell to a population . 
   opportunity to do something we should have done 60 years ago uk the 51st state ? 
   ) ) do n't do it just now though . 
  i 've had way too much popcorn this past year : s, 
   he could n't get the uk to stay in the eu we could n't get to uk to stay out with two [ non ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/27/newsid_4187000/4187714.stm ) . 
  who knows ... 
  if it helps , someone shot and killed a rhino in a french zoo and stole their horn . 
  so you can imagine how much shame i feel . 
   i mean do you pretend nice , berlin , cologne , rotherham , bataclan and such never happened ? 
  did anyone say that ? 
  calm down you sound salty, 
  looks like you 're back in business under trump , 
  / u/executivemonkey you got kindling for a nice bbq, 
  poor poland . 
  :( always left out the loop . 
   and a bunch of other more northern states what bunch of northern states are you talking about ? 
  netherlands ? 
  because denmark ... not in the euro . 
  sweden . 
  not in the euro . 
  finland ? 
  they 're going through a crisis atm . 
  the baltics ? 
  really ? 
   much as i would like it . 
  did you write him a stern worded letter ? 
  yes, 
   everyone else : why exactly should we care ? 
  ftfy . 
   so who gets first dibs shotgun , 
   they are simply foreigners you should google the definition of the word foreigner . 
  if they have citizenship they are no longer foreigners . 
  being spanish is n't just a legal status ; it 's far more than that , that is something you were taught to believe . 
  but in reality being spanish means just that . 
  a legal status . 
  if you wan na talk about being catalan or being andalusian that 's a different story . 
  but again , usually do n't involve a legal status except if they 're a recognized minority and have special rights for example to have schools in catalan or others . 
   intellectual property which is property . 
   they are borderline lying in advertising . 
  no they are not . 
  you misunderstand things . 
  sprite is n't a * standard * it 's a * product * . 
  that means that someone owns the product sprite and they can do whatever they want with it . 
  if sprite were a standard , i 'd agree with you , they 're not respecting the standard . 
  but it 's not . 
  it 's something someone owns . 
  are you telling people what they can and can not do with stuff they own ? 
   for these individuals it 's no birthright : i do n't know how it works in your country , but it seems that you do not consider certain citizens are actually fellow citizens . 
  just lesser individuals of some sort . 
  also it seems odd that you 'd consider someone that actually had to conscious make efforts to become a citizen as a lesser compared to someone who came out of a spanish vagina . 
  pretty sure this rulling is for dual citizens . 
  if that 's the case , then one citizenship can be dropped . 
   or you do have a m\u00fcller , but there 's only one or two of those in your city , and you wo n't go there for your day-to-day grocery shopping , none of these products are day to day stuff . 
  nutella , sprite , fish fingers are not day to day . 
  go there each weekend and buy in bulk what you need for that week . 
  * explode the profits of stores you like * and you 'll get many many more stores built and consumers will get their high quality produce . 
  done !, 
   coca-cola should be free to sell sprite with different recipes in czech republic and in germany - they just should n't be free to call both of them `` sprite '' . 
  but the receipies from us differ from those of france differ from those of poland . 
  so which one do you call sprite ? 
  sprite is the name of their product . 
  they can label a piece of wood as sprite and sell it like that because they own that name so they can do whatever they want with it . 
  or you can read the label . 
   electronics we do n't even make electronics in europe anymore . 
  thought he just played football . 
  did n't know he started other ventures . 
   `` ban the robots '' tax the robots . 
  something this nerd suggested as well https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/19/bill-gates-calls-for-robot-tax/, 
  allowed for the rebirth of poland , for the dismantling of the austro-hungarian empire , dismantling of the ottoman empire and creating of a modern turkey . 
   based on the ** legend ** of cossacks sending a reply to an ultimatum of the sultan, 
   those pol generally have 30 % to 40 % of french anwsering they wont vote for anybody . 
  first round elections always have 80 % of the people willing to come out and vote . 
   bloody scots are so anti-english they could n't even bring themselves to name syphilis after them !, 
  dude this is a map of people who fuck . 
  english were never that high on such a list . 
   so in conclusion : it 's all france 's fault . 
  < conspiracy hat on  unless italy got away with starting it all !, 
  one theory is that is brought to europe by spanish sailors and the first outbreak happened during the [ the war over naples ] ` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_war_of_1499%e2%80%931504 ) . 
  french soldiers got it from hookers there . 
  erosion giveth , erosion taketh away . 
   who is to say what the right strategy is ? 
  it 's all theory at this point . 
  what 's less theoretical is that i 'm sure you 'd get a positive correlation between size of the defense budget as percentage of gdp and probability to go to war or start shit up . 
   for example why did n't russia just invade ukraine outright ? 
  again you 're mixing stuff in order to extract the arguments that you need . 
  russia invaded ukraine because they could . 
  if ukraine had nukes , i would guarantee you that the story would be very different now .
