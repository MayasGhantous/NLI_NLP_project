  and the fact that it 's fighting the eu in order ** to not receive 12 billion ** euros is disgusting right ? 
   the eu ca n't integrate if it means it 's going to become more centralised then so be it . 
  i 'd rather have a strong nucleus of countries committed to a common project than a weak eu . 
   your people were n't forced , your democratically elected governments agreed to accepting the new member states . 
  well if someone does n't accept a multi-speed europe , that amounts to forcing other countries to maintain the situation as is . 
  the czech republic seems very very fine with a two speed eu . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_republic_and_the_euro they already fulfilled all the conditions to joins the euro in 2014 , with only the political conditions needing to be met . 
  yet here we are 3 years later , with the czech republic not presenting any timeline for when they wan na join . 
   the eu itself to explain why it 's important for us and why we should care . 
  that is not the eu 's business . 
  eu is not a teaching institutions . 
  it 's a common project . 
  and if you do n't bother to check what the benefits are , you wo n't see a frenchman or a spaniard coming to the czech republic to explain you people why the eu is good . 
  the days of colonialism when western countries went across the world to `` educate '' them are over . 
  eastern europe does not need more education , does not need spanking when it crosses the line ( romania on corruption , poland on constitutional crisis ) etc. 
  ee needs to participate on the politics of the eu . 
  ee needs to start proposing stuff . 
  you do n't get to be a passive party in such a political undertaking . 
   however it worth pointing out that the low turnout also has its benefits for the eu korwin , the party that sent the crazy dude in the eu parliament benefitted from low turnout . 
  with 23 % turnout , they crossed the 5 % boundary to get in the eu parliament and now we can hear wonderful speeches on how women are inferior on my tax money . 
  with 48 % on polish general elections , korwin did n't get over the threshold of 5 % . 
  so no !, 
  low participation is the worst thing that can happen . 
   the pied-noir community accounts for 12 % of the electorate in languedoc-roussillon , 15 % in provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur , 12 % in midi-pyrenees and 11 % in aquitaine . 
  and ? 
  turnout at the regional election was about 45 % . 
  fn got a about 40 % of that vote . 
  so that 's about 20 % of the population . 
  and it 's not like the pieds noirs stay just in their own little community and talk only with themselves . 
  they 're part of the whole french community and their ideas dissipated in their surroundings . 
  this created the conditions of a historic fn vote that continued to propagate . 
   our people are n't obliged to spend their free time educating themselves on the complicated affairs of international relations . 
  and our people should not be forced into a union with other people that frankly can not be asked to give a damn . 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/turnout.html the czech republic had ** 18 % ** turnout . 
  the czech republic had the ** second lowest ** turnout at the eu parliamentary elections . 
  a country that fucking wanted to leave had a turnout that was 60 % larger . 
  i do agree that the moralising tone is n't good . 
  the eu is not some neo-colonial project where we got ta force countries and people to do something or not . 
  if you want to give a shit and be involved , a country is welcome , if not , we 'll part ways . 
  dude having a common tax policy would be amazing . 
  enough of that dutch over irish double whatever . 
  having countries like netherlands , luxembourg , cyprus , ireland that fuck over the corporate tax rates and just create a shitty race to the bottom . 
  we 're even fucking the us over and that should stop . 
  one corporate tax rate should be across the eu . 
  in fact one common tax policy should be implemented, 
   but the local czech company dies i doubt one really regrets local companies actually . 
  i 'm sure people still buy from amazon and that 's not a eu company . 
  we 're on reddit with chinese made computers . 
   but in the cee the scale of this in the 90s and 00s was so massive that we were left with a massively skewed foreign-owned to domestic-owned ratio . 
  a lot of the stuff made by cee was inefficient , was not sufficiently productive , lacked proper quality to be suitable for exportation , did n't benefit from economy of scales . 
  look at dacia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automobile_dacia#figures the most popular model under romania ownership was a car that was a copy of the renaul 12 . they made the same car with only minor changes from ** 1969-2004 ** . 
  that 's friggin 35 years with no big changes . 
  when renault bought dacia in 2004 , it created a brand that in 10 years has made as many cars as in the previous 35 years . 
   they 're transfering it back to their home countries in the form of dividents . 
  nothing stops you from buying stocks from skoda and other czech companies   the overall sum of money taken away from the czech republic in this form is much bigger than the overall sum that we get via eu funds . 
  the sum of money the czech republic gains from making german cars that are sold outside of the country , the sum of money generated by the whole trade , the sum of money generated by german tourism and eu tourism , the sum of money invested by eu companies far far outweigh and profits obtained by companies . 
  you mean to tell us that skoda could have produced the quality of cars without vw ? 
  the quality of manufacturing and quality control , of machinery to build cars without ? 
  look at those nice sales figures https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0koda_auto#sales_figures, 
  if that 's a traditional venitian costume , here 's a traditional [ french building ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/tour_eiffel_wikimedia_commons_%28cropped%29.jpg/240px-tour_eiffel_wikimedia_commons_%28cropped%29.jpg ), 
   for free is also a consequence of having a common currency eh . 
  the major ee countries do n't have a common currency . 
  and in fact they do n't seem that willing to join the euro . 
   the fact is that richer countries benefit a lot from opening new markets if carrefour sells cheaper goods than a local polish supermarket , then the polish costumers are at a win . 
  add to that the fact that labour in ee is much cheaper so a ton of companies are moving their manufacturing over there . 
   in fact the eu funds in total are lower than what is taken away from our countries in the form of dividents back to the western european economies . 
  the famous markets that open argument ? 
  if on an equal market , you get cheaper goods from carrefour than from your local supermarket , how is that not a benefit for you ? 
  you just paid less for something . 
  and the fact that labour is much cheaper in the east means that many goods are cheaper in the east that are in the west . 
  it 's much cheaper to build dacia 's in romania , skoda 's in the czech republic and to hire polish lorry drivers . 
  not really . 
  the south east has been the place where the former colonials of algeria came back after algeria became independent . 
  fn is founded by people who strongly fought against algerian independence so that 's why people vote traditional fn . 
  also they hated de gaulle since he basically gave them independence so that 's why they do n't vote regular right wing parties . 
   anti-establishment rhetoric and in some cases they 're the biggest immigrant areas . 
  yes . 
  many immigrants in aube . 
   the fact that the south of france has strong national front support really speaks volumes and it 's certainly not just related to unemployment . 
  that 's because you have no clue how the support for fn works or about population demographics in france . 
   22 pages sorry man . 
  that 's still a fucking lot . 
   but do her supporters care ? 
  well you 're claiming that le pen will win based on the fact that her supporters are dillusional . 
  no french presidency has been won just by getting the vote of your supporters . 
  she has to convince others that she 's not corrupt . 
  good luck with that . 
   they all migrated south . 
  nope . 
  they all went to the us . 
   yea , they have a reputation for cutting costs ( = firing lots of people and closing factories ) well they saved the company . 
   `` corrupt establishment '' . 
  le pen ... not corrupt ? 
  fillon said that the parvis des droits de l'homme had 80k people . 
   given that jupp\u00e9 is more moderat yeah , he wants to suppress 250k govt employee jobs , and not 500k . 
  myes . 
  very moderate . 
  https://www.gralon.net/articles/commerce-et-societe/artisanat/article-le-costume-nicois---origines-et-traditions-1932.htm because apparently an association picked it . 
  they say it 's the traditional costume for a fisherman and the traditional costume a flower saleswoman .
