   then that would probably ruin the european union . 
  for ee maybe . 
  for we , nope we 'll do fine . 
   eu ca n't impose how this nations should govern . 
  exactly . 
  that 's precisely what 2 speed europe is . 
  telling ee okay guys , you do your own thing , we 'll do our own thing here . 
   anyone who doesnt see that the mass immigration leads to a disaster ... well , read the news again . 
  the major mass migration we 're saying across western europe is coming from eastern europe . 
  she 's not a shothead though . 
  something one can not say about this dude . 
  poland obstruction of the constitutional court , hungary and obstruction of the press and opposition , romania and corruption . 
  ee and their feet dragging when joining the euro or their reaction to the migrant crisis . 
  you asked on what basis should meps see their right to allocated speech time reduced . 
  i answered on the basis that they broke the law . 
  you answer that you ca n't prosecute them is they break the law i answer that i 'm not saying we should prosecute them just reduce their priviledges . 
  just because you ca n't prosecute them , that does n't mean they did n't break the law . 
  well then a two speed europe will be to the liking of these people since in they 'll be in their own sphere where they can decide for themselves . 
   eu has n't done anything to change this perception . 
  that 's not the eu 's business . 
   he 's free of legal restrictions legal restrictions are not all types of restrictions . 
  i am not asking for him to be sent to jail . 
  i am asking for his right to express any opinion be severely reduced and if he continues to express such opinions for his salary to be cut and finally for poland to have a reduction of budget . 
  i fail to see why you 're talking about different topics . 
   they do exactly what france does . 
  france had a fundamental role in creating the eu . 
  what did poland do ? 
  and if some ee countries continue on the path they 're going , i hope france will have a fundamental role in creating a two speed europe . 
  you did n't answer the question i am asking . 
  what beneficial political contribution is poland making to the political eu project ? 
  well nowadays we have before us the option of a two speed europe . 
  and we have to wonder what is the political contribution of some eu countries to the political eu project ? 
  if polish citizens feel it is not worth their time to go out and vote for the eu political project , what political contribution are they willing to make ? 
  if he made that speech in the parlament in strasbourg then yes he did break the law in france https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/lois_contre_le_racisme_et_les_discours_de_haine#france, 
  that 's a very poor excuse . 
  and if you admit that poland has very poor politicians and since the eu has become a political organisation , do you not then admit that poland 's part in the eu is very problematic ? 
  i find it very amazing that the people who joined the eu the soonest also have very very low turnouts . 
   since the people who have the power to set the laws are the government in power , that 's effectively entrusting the government that makes it into power . 
  the govt does not set any laws . 
   if , say , le pen somehow wound up controlling france she has to respect the laws in france . 
   surely if anyone is to challenge the laws of europe , it should be a legislator ? 
  you do n't change a law by committing an act that breaks that law . 
  it 's an expression not meant to be taken literally . 
   mate , look around at home and sweep up the shit i ca n't do that because that would imply me voting for le pen and i do n't want a death penalty in france . 
  the moment she agrees to not implement the death penalty , yes i might become much more likely to vote for someone like that if the eu does not express any desire to change . 
   after that you still ca n't tell me what to do . 
  maybe you 're confused . 
  i am not telling you what to do . 
  i have no control over what happens in your country nor do i wish such a control . 
  i have control over what happens in my country through my vote , 
   hmm . 
  so extremists tend to vote in less-intelligent people ? 
  why are you bringing the topic of intelligence in here ? 
   about irrelevant eu elections nearly as much . 
  that two-speed europe will happen and parliament will be a witness to it , 
   i 'm assuming that he was n't just randomly ramblin what makes you assume that ? 
   that this related to some sort of eu initiative on mandating equal pay for different genders . 
  the laws in europe already stipulate that you can not give a different salary based on gender considerations . 
   provides immunity from slander laws to their legislators in the legislature . 
  immunity is immunity . 
  not just immunity from slader . 
  it covers all areas of life in ** penal ** matters . 
  i am not talking about sending him to jail . 
  i am simply asking for his right to allocated time be reduced since he expressed a belief that goes against the laws of european countries . 
  and that his country get a reduction of funds if he continues being disrupted . 
  i do not think you want your money to pay for texan schools that preach creationism . 
  then why are you forcing me to give my tax money to someone that preaches illegal acts ? 
   what 's the basis for believing that higher voter turnout in poland would make for more-intelligent legislators ? 
  simple logic . 
  the fewer the votes the more likely it is for extremists to win . 
  extremists tend to be much more political than regular people . 
   so what does your criteria for acceptable speech derive from ? 
  does the person express an idea that is actually illegal under current laws ? 
  neah . 
  the finance ministers will once more gather behing close doors and save europe for the umteen time . 
  http://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png?fb you sound like those people that kept saying after the vote the surely brexit wo n't really happen , 
  so you 're telling me he 's ... jesus ? 
  suffering for the sins of others ? 
  true . 
  the other plan is a multi speed europe http://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/junckers-real-scenario-is-multi-speed-europe/ , 
   i was n't commenting on poland 's specifically well you should because that is the result . 
  when only just some people turn out to vote and others do n't bother , it is an unhealthy regime . 
   the people in charge are not as deranged upstairs like you . 
  http://www.france24.com/en/20170203-merkel-says-europes-future-could-be-two-speed , 
   see that 's where we also differ ; no we differ because i explained to you how employment law works and you 're telling me about your hopes and dreams . 
  it is not a healthy parliament . 
  poland had only a 23 % turnout for this election . 
  it is a diseased parliament . 
  no no . 
  the difference is that jupp\u00e9 actually ** was convicted ** for creating fake jobs to siphon money . 
   has the turn out ever been significantly higher ? 
  turnout in france is 50 % higher . 
  that is * significant * . 
  and we 're not the ones claiming that we love the eu so much and making nice little human flags . 
   you 're not in charge of anything so you ca n't say that seriously . 
  oh my friend . 
  it 's the general sentiment . 
  look at uk , they left with immigration issues being one of the highest problems . 
  and when they 'll start imposing visas and restrict the right to live or work in the uk , who do you think will be first affected ? 
  romanians , polish or french ?
