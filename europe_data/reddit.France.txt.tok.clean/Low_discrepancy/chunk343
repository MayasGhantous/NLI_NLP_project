  i 'm just noticing the general mood . 
  he was voted into the eu parliament . 
  why ? 
  because no one bothers to vote in poland . 
  so only extremists show up and they elect shitheads like this . 
  yeah . 
  ever heard of voter fatigue ? 
  35 years of voting . 
  in 3 elections poland has not made higher turnouts than france . 
  nor has romania . 
  we have one of the largest anti-eu sentiments and ** still ** get higher turnouts than romania , where people love to say how much they love the eu . 
  if you love something , participate . 
  if not , two speeds it will be . 
  do n't complain when bad things will happen to the eu then . 
  that 's what you do in order to block out parliament debates ? 
  because i do n't try to do that . 
  i actually believe parliament is important . 
  exactly . 
  you do n't understand the importance of parliament . 
   we wanted to get rid of him by sending him abroad ... did n't work well ... how about you get rid of him by actually going out and vote . 
  poland has the 3rd [ ** lowest ** ] ( http://www.ukpolitical.info/european-parliament-election-turnout.htm ) turnout at 23 % . 
  just behind slovakia and the czech republic . 
  go out and vote . 
  france had a turnout for eu elections that was ** 100 ** larger . 
  that 's the actual thing poland should be ashamed . 
  are you telling me that i do n't need to listen what 's happening in my own eu parliament ? 
  well of course you 're saying that . 
  you 're forced to block out the parliament because wilder 's party will be the second largest . 
  why is there a retard in the eu parliament ? 
  ** answer ** : turnout for the eu elections in 2014 : * poland [ 23.83 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_ ( poland \\ ) ) * romania [ 32.44 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_ ( romania \\ ) ) * france [ 42.43 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_ ( france \\ ) ) . 
  * germany [ 48.1 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_ ( germany \\ ) ) eastern europe has no desire to participate in the eu , eastern europe should be left behind . 
  http://www.ukpolitical.info/european-parliament-election-turnout.htm fucking croatia a country that just entered is at 25 % while uk a country that 's leaving had 35 %, 
   no speech should be blocked in parliament . 
  we do not have infinite time to listen to all types of speeches . 
   bigoted speech should still be classed under free speech . 
  free speech ** does not mean no fucking consequences ** . 
  free speech just means that you should n't go to jail for saying shit like that . 
  go to your workplace and start saying women should be paid less . 
  you ca n't shout : freeeee speeeech while you 're getting fired . 
  he can sit on a soapbox in warsaw and speak shit to his heart 's delight . 
  but that does not give him the right to speak in one of the highest institutions of the eu . 
  sex is a protected class and he called for something that is illegal . 
  as such the eu parliament should and must sanction him . 
  what education did you receive in genetics ? 
  what 's your higher degree in that area ? 
  honestly this type of speech should be blocked by whomever was controlling the mic . 
  it is a disgrace to the whole of the eu parliament that such a thing can carry on . 
  it is not a stage for ranting or expressing their idiotic beliefs . 
  the eu should start implementing sanctions , reduction of salary etc. 
  it 's not a friggin youtube comment section . 
  a two speed eu can not come fast enough . 
  shame they do n't use lead in pencils anymore . 
  early onset dementia . 
  i do n't remember it looking this nice . 
  neighbours just across the borders : enemies for life . 
  country on the opposite side of the globe : omg bros < 3, 
   no , i am saying that the expected inflation in 2017 will not be in line without the eu expectations , and that that was known in 2016 . 
  inflation rate is estimated at 1 % . 
  the recommended inflation rate to join the euro is around 2 % . 
  where do you get your numbers from . 
   so joining the eurozone while knowing fully well that you are going to break the engagement necessary for joining right away is disingenuous . 
  what are you talking about . 
  you 're giving me an inflation for 2015 when romania was supposed to enter erm ii in 2016 to get into the euro in 2019 . 
  romania could have very well entered erm ii back then but decided neah it 's fine . 
  no pressure . 
  and there are no signs of them joining this year in order to enter the euro in 2020 . 
   romania , bulgaria and croatia will join soon enough , in my opinion . 
  more actions would be nice . 
  if countries do n't want 2 speeds they should n't take advantage of the two speeds . 
   hy did they choose the us deal , do you know ? 
  they chose the airbus deal then decided actually noooo us is better when poland changed govt . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/poland-cancels-multi-billion-euro-airbus-helicopters-deal/a-35967557  and imposing visas does n't even have to mean less tourists for france . . 
  if you make it harder for people to do something , fewer people will do it . 
  it 's just logic, 
   the target for the hicp inflation rate was only reached in 2016 . 
   also , romania will need to secure entry to the erm ii area yes the plan was for it to join in june 2016 in order to join the eurozone in 2019 but romania 's central govt decided it 's okay . 
  there 's no hurry . 
   so the 2020 target looks achievable o paper , but i have serious doubts it will be achieved . 
  exactly . 
  romania is happy with a 2 speed europe . 
   `` what benefits the eu also benefits my country '' well poland decided to give the finger to a very generous airbus helicopter deal in favour of the us , and now we 're imposing visas on american citizens even though they 're big tourists in europe and especially france . 
  sorry ... what ? 
   we should get rid of national passports . 
  that 'll happen when the eu will be a federation . 
  we 're not there and so nope . 
  exactly . 
  romania has fulfilled ** all ** the economic conditions to join the eurozone . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_and_the_euro heck , with a little control of the inflation rate , they 'd would have respected all the conditions in 2014 . 
  they could have joined erm ii in 2015 but the romanian central bank said meh , they 're fine . 
  they 'd rather be out of the euro for the time being , no pressure ... 
  but hey maybe 2020 ? 
  no one really knows when romania will join the euro . 
  so indeed some countries are indeed more equal than others . 
  holy fucking facepalm we 're racking in shit logic today . 
  `` if gay people stop acting gay then they 'll be equals '' . 
   because people think that hairy men in my experience they seem quite well groomed . 
   if so , then why not support getting it over with now because until a formal declaration is made , it 's an internal issue of the uk . 
  if trump declares nato obsolete , should we leave nato ? 
  uk 's pm declared that he 'll call for brexit immediately then he reneged . 
  so wtf do you want from us ?
