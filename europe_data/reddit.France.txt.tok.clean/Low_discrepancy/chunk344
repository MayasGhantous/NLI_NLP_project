  make a formal statement and we 'll reply with a formal statement . 
  if you do n't want a formal statement , then ok : we promise brits wo n't leave . 
  there ya go , you got an unofficial comment from a frenchman , 
   i can understand the want for a pride parade when it was first legalized in estonia you do n't have the right to full adoptions if you 're a gay couple . 
  so no , gay people do n't have the same rights are hetero people . 
   also i think that most of the gay community agrees with me * 1 ) it 's something you think and not know . 
  you did n't poll anyone . 
  that 's quite arrogant to claim something in the name of a whole group . 
  * 2 ) if gay parades are still taking place it means that some gay people still want to parade . 
  * 3 ) even if only a * minority * of gay people want parades , do you think the * majority * of a sexual minority that has been historically oppressed will go around and impose restrictions ? 
  * 4 ) suicide rates tend to be higher in the lgbt community so claiming that now everything is fine because the law makes them equal is ridiculous , they still suffer from stigma . 
   however , that does not mean that france should n't do the same . 
  i do n't think the french government thinks that the status quo is an option any more !, 
  when uk will trigger art 50 then i 'll expect the french govt to do the same for uk . 
  until then i fail to see why france should meddle in the internal affairs of uk . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/01/french-more-keen-on-brexit-than-british-says-major-poll/  are proof of your bitterness . 
  i 'll tell you what de gaulle told you twice : non . 
  a frenchman to be sad seeing the british leave ? 
  that 'd be a first , 
  you sound salty , 
  fine . 
  uk does n't have to act first ... meaning they wo n't trigger any article , 
   they wanted we are happy with the status quo . 
  uk is the one that wants to change the status quo , uk is the dynamic party and so uk is the first that is meant to act . 
  under the current status quo , all british have the right to stay and work in the eu and ** no ** eu country expressed ** any ** wish to change that , 
  sangria is what you make when someone gifts you spanish wine . 
  you get your wines from languedoc ? 
  you poor soul you : /, 
   i do n't then okay . 
  i gave an example of type promotion . 
  it 's far more common for the programmer to not know what they 're doing than for the language to not be `` sensible '' . 
  you do n't code do you ? 
  again why do people get their news from twitter . 
  why do people get their news from twitter ? 
  now lets talk about macron and his anti-gay marriage people were humiliated . 
   i absolutely do . 
  criminalizing any opinion is wrong . 
  the start a political party and get votes to change your laws . 
  good luck , 
   , though the french do like claiming sk\u0142odowska-curie for themselves that 's because if curie had stayed in poland she would have been a nurse or something like that . 
  france gave her the means and environment to achieve greatness . 
  well you 're contradicting yourself . 
  you claim power to the people yet refuse to give them that power . 
  you claim the people do n't want a new referendum but for example the scottish parliament is largely in favour . 
  makes no sense . 
  not to mention that the uk parliament : 36 % of the votes gave 51 % of seats . 
  wtf ? 
  how is that power to the majority ? 
   it seems most scottish people do n't want a referendum . 
  so you should change the legal system that says that the parliament is the highest authority . 
  decisions from referenda should be the highest authority then . 
   the ball bullet . 
   this needs at least a `` little `` intent it probably depends a lot on your local laws . 
  because as per the wiki definition , you do n't really need premeditation/intent . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder heck if i go stabbing people on the street should i be accused of murder ? 
  it 's not like every stab results in death and i 'm just stabbing at random . 
  when you hire people , do you turn them off because `` i 'm sorry you 're not the correct age '' or do you hire people that are the most competent ? 
  wtf is this shitty article ? 
   he says he will not change the infamous 35-hour week , will not repeal the wealth tax created 35 years ago when the socialists ruled france together with their communist allies , and he will not raise the official retirement age , currently set at 60 , one of the eu 's lowest . 
  besides completely backpeddaling later on their statement that macron does n't wan na change the 35 hours and the isf tax , the french retirement age is at 65 now . 
  potatoes are n't a dish though . 
  it takes preparation to make mayonnaise and it takes preparation to make fries . 
  slapping both together and saying : we made this guys is not exactly the pinnacle of ingenuity . 
   and she is far more extreme than what the uk wants . 
  said the country that 's leaving the eu . 
   in case you did n't notice the uk is a country with a common culture in the case you did n't notice , the eu is a single market . 
   i do n't think you understand economics . 
  http://www.igmchicago.org/uncategorized/igm-launches-new-panel-of-top-european-economic-experts me and this panel of economic experts that agree or strongly agree that freedom of movement has made the average western european richer . 
   to be fair , fries with mayo is famously dutch considering that neither fries nor mayo are considered to come from the netherlands ... that 's odd . 
   40 % of the french want to vote for le pen in the 2nd and 50 % of british voted to leave the eu . 
   she is even worse than ukip well considering that we 've had the worse terrorist attacks since ww2 , i think we 're doing pretty well at 40 % . 
   seem kind of absurd and also undemocratic to ignore that people dont want unlimited economic immigration . 
  well 60 % of the votes will go to a pro-european candidate , be it fillon or macron . 
  you were saying ? 
  no you did n't . 
  you would have read that adam smith was in favour of worker mobility . 
     london is full of eastern european homeless . 
  considering that the immigrants you get are more skilled than your average population , then on a per capita basis , i 'd be pretty sure that you have more homeless british than homeless europeans . 
   what is your point ? 
  willkommen to the free market my friend . 
  you do n't want a free market ? 
  then goodbye , 
   well the far right keeps growing and mass immigration is the main cause . 
  spain , france , germany have the same number of immigrants . 
  and no country is exiting . 
  it 's just that uk is extremely unequal . 
  gdp of uk is the same as france 's . 
  but look at productivity rates , you have the same productivity rates as friggin italy . 
  look at poverty rates . 
  for 50 + yos it 's 50 % higher and 100 % higher for 60 + yos compared to france . 
  far right is rising because you have a shit system that did n't protect the poor . 
  you should read some adam smith . 
  turns out when lesser people come to those in power and tell them : hey lets be equal ! ... it does n't turn out well . 
  well that 's why you had to leave . 
  eu is n't made for you guys and you simply had no power to change it . 
   but the point that eu2 countries are a vastly disproportionate source of immigration stands i understand that you , as a british person are new to the innerworkings of the eu and its previous iterations . 
  but the freedom of movement was by design to allow people to move from areas where there are no jobs to areas where there are jobs . 
  it 's not unique at all to eu2 ( whatever that is ) . 
  it happened with for the portuguese that came to settle in france , italians that came to france and germany . 
  we 've had mass migrations in the past and we 'll have them in the future .
