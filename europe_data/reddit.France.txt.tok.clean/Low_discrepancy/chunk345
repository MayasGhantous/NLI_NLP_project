   there is no reason why the eu should allow this mass immigration that adds no economic benefit . 
  do you track the number of non-london british people that move the london every year ? 
  what do those numbers say ? 
  still salty because of [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/luxembourgpartitionsmap_english.png ), 
   cus the dumb thieving gypsies are easier to pay to vote , than the ones with proper education . 
  yeah . 
  you 're not a racist, 
   the problem is the attitude of most of those gypsies as they break the law numerous times and the police does n't really react same speech we hear from trump concerning mexicans and blackies, 
  this is a brilliant design . 
  this shit can make a turn faster than any other . 
  but if they change too much of it , will it still remain the same ship ? 
  but before jadot went to hamon apparently . 
  if that 's your president at the helm , then that 's actually your flag ship . 
  she can still give people a lot of wood . 
  kinda like how alexander identified as both greek and slavic ? 
   tesla was croatian by birth/born in modern day croatia and was serbian by language and culture , his ethnic ancestry was wallachian and he was a proud usa citizen for 50 years . 
  the inventor of pc culture and multiculti . 
  -- this will make quite a few people dislike him . 
  friggin thieves man . 
  just like some people like to national credit for the famous french scientist marie curie . 
  so you do n't have the right to full adoptions . 
   what makes piketty so special he gives facts and numbers . 
  great work debunking what he said  you 're right . 
  the world is doing just fine . 
  brexit and trump show that just fine , 
  what 's the roi of saving african babies ? 
   a loan is expected to be repaid by the money it helps the receiver make . 
  did you earn anything when taking a loan ? 
  other than sweet promises that you 'll pay back ? 
  / u/solewanderer only understands salary , he does n't understand lending . 
  when you give money , you 're expected to pay back that money and also * interest * . 
  the value of that interest is more or less the value of ** risk ** the lender is willing to take . 
  risk because not everybody will pay back their loans . 
  in this case europe is not giving money just because why not guys . 
  the roi is much higher when the people are very poor than when they 're rich . 
  that 's why with a reasonable amount of money in africa you can save millions of lives like gates did , while at san francisco you just get an app that calls a car easier . 
   and let 's start something fresh honest and new . 
  said the guy from the country that wants to reactivate the commonwealth . 
   a weak organization called olaf not just powerless , olaf 's suicidal !, 
   germany is also going to have shut all of it 's nuclear plants by 2022 ah yes , the country that produces 80 % more co2 per capita , than i do . 
  indeed amazing model . 
  tell me more about them , 
   i was taught from the childhood that money needs to be earned . 
  giving is for the beggars and the disabled . 
  do you understand the concept of lending money ? 
  so you do wan na have the gdp of costa rica i see since you no longer want any of that heavy industry you have , or big cities that consume a ton of electricity . 
  here buddy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption if you wan na be costa rica , be ready to consume ** 60 % ** less electricity  . 
  turn off your computer , you already consumed too much :d, 
  you can have costa rica 's gdp if you want to , 
   nuclear power is not a panacea to climate change , nor is it even the only solution . 
  said the person that produces 50 % more co2 emissions than me . 
   the us and france are not comparable in that sense you said that macron is bernie which is bullshit like i said . 
  cheerio man . 
   nationality and not a citizenship map would n't change for france since they 're the same thing . 
   i 'm not sure if bernie would be against lowering the rates that france currently has , let 's see the [ coporate tax rates ] ( https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/tax-rates-online/corporate-tax-rates-table.html ) . 
  * us : 40 % * france : 33.3 % and 25 % is macron is elected you were saying ? 
   i think bernie is a realist good for you to think about stuff , but try checking out facts  . 
  cheerio, 
   apparently , even people from other eu countries have it harder in sweden to get a job and integrate . 
  language , networking etc. 
  http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking 70 % -80 % of new job offers are never published , simply given through networking . 
  someone who did their education in sweden has a higher network of contacts in sweden that someone that did their in malta . 
  the very low eu unemployment rate would probably be because i assume anyone who goes to sweden is quite more qualified than the average immigrant towards other countries . 
   but what about the productivity of existing employment ? 
  like per link that i showed you , we 're more productive than * all * the nordics , except norway . 
  but norway with it 's 5 million population , has an export map that looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/norwar_exports_tree_map_%282009%29.pdf ) while france 's looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/france_export_treemap.jpg ) . 
  i kinda think it takes more human work to make an ariane 5 than to make crude oil . 
   macron decides to try the bernwagon are you comparing bernie with a guy that wants to tax companies and rich people * less * ? 
   really ? 
  france did n't fail during the economic crisis ? 
  oh , we had to bail out banks ... that shit tends to cost money . 
  long live private enterprise . 
   there 's overbudget and then there 's 300 % overbudget and 8 years late , and counting . 
  well lhc went over budget by 200 % . 
  iter is also very much over budget . 
   sadly our government is more interested in giving state aid what state aid are they being given ? 
  edf+c hina are building hinkley point and the uk govt is insuring a cost of a certain price . 
  the fact that the cfo of edf resigned over hinkley is proof enough all the risk are in fact with edf + chinese . 
   flamanville 3 and olkiluoto 3 provide great examples to not support more nuclear plants in the uk . 
  uk is producing 50 % more co2 per capita than france . 
   did n't germany also try something similar almost 10 years ago ? 
  we 're not germany and we have no means to become germany . 
  this : oh i wan na be country x is just some feel good bullshit . 
  yeah he needed several months for a project that basically is : we 'll cut public spending and help companies by lowering the corp tax rate . 
  oh and my rich friends , also more money to them !, 
  dude 's dead in the water . 
   ) edit : oh oh , i dared insult / r/europe fav candidate . 
  never mind that thomas piketty said that the tax cut for the rich that macron is proposing would be a huge mistake to implement http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/06/14/repenser-limpot-sur-le-patrimoine/ we 'll favor nice eu flags and young faces over economic arguments . 
   they do n't really connect it to the flexicurity model ( which is more typical of the danish system , right ? ), 
  in france a few economists came out with statements that increasing job flexibility does n't really correlate well with decreased unemployment . 
  in fact , if someone wants to hire someone and not have to worry about firing them , they 'll just sign fixed term contracts and extend the period at the end . 
  honestly any comparison with the nordic model is kinda pointless and just macron promising stuff that sounds good on paper but is hollow . 
  we have much higher population than the nordics . 
  much less freedom to act since we do n't control our currencies . 
  different educational systems . 
  higher productivity rates of all nordics except norway https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_hour_worked unemployment is mostly people with little skills looking for a job ... 
  you maybe not want that but the romanian central bank does and it slowed down implementation so that instead of romania joining the eurozone in 2019 , it 'll do it in 2021-2022 ( maybe ) . 
  yes . 
  a two speed europe . 
   of course you like a two speed europe when it benefits you and you dislike it when it does n't benefit you .
