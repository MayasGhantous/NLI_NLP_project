  first major project in history that has exceeded the budget and time . 
  lhc had a total budget of 7.5 billion euros . 
  experiments and all . 
  it ended up costing 13 billion to find the higgs boson . 
  total failure . 
  sad . 
  so called accelerator . 
   assuming current trends continue when flamanville 3 will get online in some 3-4 years , 1600 mw will be added , that 's 8 % of what you see in a year . 
  finland will be another 8 % . 
  hinkley point will be some 15 % ,, 
   for example , in romania fulfills ** all ** the economic conditions to join the euro . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_and_the_euro there only remains mostly political ones : legislation and entering the exchange rate mechanism ( basically starting to peg the currency to the euro ) . 
  romanian central bank instead in 2015 that neah they 're cool not being in the euro , it 's too troublesome to join , so they 'll try to join in 2020 instead of 2019 . 
  now talk is about 2021 or 2022 . 
  romania seems ** very ** happy with a two speed europe , so they 'll get just that , 
   much worse than trump . 
  no she 's not . 
  she can at least hold a coherent speech . 
   doubt le pen will gain power le pen wo n't have control of the parlament unlike trump . 
  so even if she wins , it wo n't be like a brexit where the parlament is useless or trump that has full control . 
  tons . 
  every banlieue has tons of them . 
  they 're not soviet-era just brutalist buildings . 
  signs of authoritarianism buddy . 
  got ta stump the weed as soon as you see it . 
  nazi germany was n't built in a day . 
  i really hope we could do this with in france . 
   what a lot of people believe , is that the few who are terrorist are evidence of islam and western culture being incompatible . 
  weird . 
  that 's ** exactly ** almost word per word what the french believed about the italians 100 years ago . 
  did n't help that italians committed terrorist attacks in france , even killing one president . 
   and muslims were involved in a number of actual terrorists attacks . 
  and italians were involved in terrorist attacks in france . 
   everything you said can be criticized , but not on the ground of it being nazism . 
  he constantly works to discredit the press and the justive system . 
  `` so called judge '' . 
   but oh of course it 's just the fascists , we all know how free speech was under stalin , pol pot & mao . 
  can i assault liberals because i decided they are associated with these movements ? 
  such tolerance . 
  where did the guy even talk about stalin , mao etc , let alone defend them ? 
   in any progressive country . 
  secular country . 
  iran is not buying any 380s . 
  just 320s and some 350s . comac already makes competitors for 320s . 
  that being said if airbus does n't wan na play ball , boeing will ( which they did also by selling 80 ) . 
  but from conferences airbus people participated , it 's very obvious they 're willing to play ball . 
  money beats veil . 
  you 'll realise it when/if you 'll have to make that choice, 
  yeah . 
  just boeing . 
  yes . 
  if only airbus made planes ... 
   facto so it 's not mandatory . 
  dude mandatory means they 'll fuck your day up if you do n't have it . 
  mandatory means you 'll get a fine if you do n't have it . 
  identity controls are n't some type of common procedure and you can show even your carte vitale or your student id . 
  and if you wan na really fuck with them , the only thing they can do is take your fingerprints and release you after at most 4 hours . 
  so no , ids are not mandatory in france . 
  end of story !, 
   both macron and bayrou want proportionnelles though . 
  yeah . 
  but they wo n't trigger a referendum between may and june to change the system . 
  so what they want and what they get are different things . 
   unless so it 's not mandatory . 
  thank you . 
   but because of the party that 's backing him . 
  you have to remember that should macron win the presidency , he would need to have a working parliament , myes . 
  currently the national assembly has 1 deputy from modem out of 577 . 
  doubt they 'll gather any significant majority . 
   especially when it 's a topic the far right loves and we know that they keep using this tactic . 
  dude , have you actually met a muslim in your entire life ? 
   this ban is pretty much like banning crosse answer : no , no you have n't . 
  but continuing your noble fight for people you have n't really entered in contact with . 
   `` i am usually a left winger but even i have enough of those muslims '' . 
  do you imagine arguments in your own mind , only to contradict them and pretend that you 're superior ? 
   refusing to show your face to the police is already illegal in germany to my best knowledge well in france you do n't have an obligation to have any id on you . 
  and when identity checks happen , it 's simply sufficient for someone to testify that you 're so and so . 
  see how laws differ from country to country and have different impacts ? 
   as an example ; beating my wife is illegal anywhere . 
  now , i stop beating her when the police come over , and then start again as soon as they leave . . that 's very different from the act of beating my wife being `` illegal anywhere '' . 
  if you beat your wife in a forest , did she make any noise ? 
   if it is illegal to have the face covered when driving , then you can be retro-actively charged for commiting the crime of driving with face covered . 
  depends how the law is drafted . 
  in france is it not drafted like that . 
  in france you simply do not have the right to hide your face . 
   it is illegal to cover-one 's - face-when-asked-to-reveal-it-by-a-police-officer , that is an entirely different activity and an entirely differnt law . 
  yes . 
  it 's almost like it depends a lot on how the law is made and people get carried away for nothing . 
   also notice that this proposal by bavaria is most likely goin gto be scrapped by the federal court as it seems to be unconstitutional . 
  this is also what chancellor merkel thinks . 
  it depends on how it is drafted . 
  the french law passed the ecthr because it is drafted not to target muslims but all people who want to hide their faces . 
  and again hiding one 's face means having the right to now show your face . 
  in france you do n't have that right . 
   what 'd sad is that you did n't see that i was being frivolous . 
  you raised concerns that are n't there and you were told that your concerns are not valid  . 
  i 'm sure you learnt something from this . 
   `` and while driving '' - this means it would apply whether or not one was in a government institution . . at least that 's what the media are claiming . 
  and do you know how the law works ? 
  let me tell you how it works in france where it 's illegal to cover your face anywhere .
