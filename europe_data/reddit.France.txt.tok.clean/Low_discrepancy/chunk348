  i wan na sell out airbuses . 
  more jobs in france . 
  if you do n't wan na do trade with them , that 's perfectly acceptable , less competition for france . 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about , nor do i care . 
  what would be comparable : do i think that western europe should stop discussing with trump ? 
  no because that 's not how diplomacy works . 
  now fellow arms seller , lets go suck some saudi arabia c * ck and pretend we have morals . 
  hey if it worked on / r/europe i wonder what magic it did on t_d or l_p ... 
   his country also needs us much more than we need them ? 
  they 've got money , we have airbuses . 
  you do the math , 
   they could have declined to visit , like le pen did . 
  that 's not how diplomacy works , buddy . 
   whether a publicity stunt or not , this should be the default action of any western politician asked to wear a hijab if she does n't normally wear one . 
  as a greek why are n't you sending your sisters to mt athos . 
  come on , lead by example buddy, 
  i doubt there are people out there that regularly have 1k saved up for emergencies but can not afford to spend 100 euros on a washing machine, 
   not affording a car not affording a car means you can not apply for certain jobs . 
  it means you 're serverly restricted to find work close to public transport and renting places close to public transport at well ( which means rent is higher ) . 
  it makes it much more difficult for to pick up your kids from school , drop them off , take them to do nice things with their colleagues , meaning they also get isolated . 
   yet this person could still afford rent , utilities , a warm home , and to eat well . 
  what if someone breaks in their house and steals some of their shit ? 
  they have to fix the lock and call a locksmith . 
  insurance wo n't cover any basic stuff and will start paying only if the damage is larger than 100 euros . 
  what if the stove breaks down or the fridge ? 
  here 's at least 200 euros you have to pay . 
  what if a pipe breaks . 
  you still have to pay and insurance might not cover it . 
  oh you got ta not forget to pay insurance ... yearly or annualy . 
  living on a paycheck to paycheck does n't mean it 's just a `` not nice situation '' , it means you 're a few bad events from not paying rent and getting evicted ... 
  ever heard of the word nuance ? 
  / u/glarbung is presenting different nuances of communism : stalinism , maoism , trotskisme , bolshevism , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communist_ideologies, 
  check ukraine for what happens when you shoot to kill . 
  hitler stash and twitter handle mocca master ... some stuff you simply can not invent .

   i could n't be outside , climbing mt. 
  olympus . 
  i do n't always stay outside . 
  sometimes i 'm inside ... heck i even prefer it for that type of activity . 
  do you not understand that if the black player would play at the other team he 'd be their black friend ? 
  how can you be racist if you have a black friend ? 
  it 's okay . 
  she loves the police , law and order in general . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_let_pobedy why was it launched in 93 but had its maiden voyage only on 07 ? 
   who 's stronger ? 
  the french ? 
  well one has a nuclear powered aircraft carrier , the other has some in the works . 
  until then ... it 's too complicated to say . 
  the only thing the uk has more is destroyers to the tune of 1 . 
  but they have different goals . 
  russia might have a more powerful fleet though . 
   can blockade the mediterranean in war with gibraltar . 
   ) yeah man sure . 
   that 's ridiculous . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's a method of analysing how resources are used . 
  the number of hours worked is a resource and the us uses it much more heavily compared to a german for example . 
  it is simply the major difference between a us worker vs a german worker . 
  on a per hour basis they produce the same amount . 
  in the us they do n't work smarter they just work longer so they earn more . 
  in germany or france they prefer to work less and do something else with their time . 
   we produce more , so yes , we 're more productive . 
  productivity is output divided by input . 
  one of the inputs here is number of hours spent . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/productivity  productivity is an average measure of the efficiency of production . 
  it can be expressed as the ratio of output to inputs used in the production process , i.e. 
  output per unit of input . 
  so your higher gdp is just a result of the fact that you work more . 
   the point is that there are too many people employed by the state yes . 
  romania has too many doctors . 
  that 's why it managed to lose 1/3rd of them since 2011 . 
  right ? 
   doctors do too much administrative work -  have less time for patients romania lost 1/3rd of its doctors to the west . 
  no way they 're doing too much admin work . 
   mississippi 's median income ( not average , not gdp ) is $ 36,919 . 
  it 's the lowest in the country , and yes it 's higher than the uk or sweden . 
  you do know that for example an average american works 400 hours than a german or 300 hours more than a frenchman per year . 
  that 's where you get your higher gdp . 
  you 're not more productive , you just work more . 
   the median gdp ppp per capita in mississippi , the poorest state in the us , is higher than in the uk that because everybody looks at gdp per capita type of stats . 
  look at productivity ppp and you 'll see that germany , france , us are n't that different for example . 
  an american works on average ** 300 ** hours per year more than a french and ** 400 ** hours per year more than a german . 
  so your quality of life comment seems kinda bullshit ... 
  it 's all fun and games until someone loses a toe . 
   they complain a lot . 
  so you 've been complaining for 6 comments now that the greeks are complaining too much ? 
   i expect to explain us all greece and greeks do n't have to explain to you shit . 
  you 're not in the eurozone and the amount of greek debt you own is probably 0 . 
  so get off your high horse and mind your own business . 
  not really a conspiracy theory . 
  / u/ilymperopo is talking about quantitative easing and / u/masquechatice is presenting his understanding . 
  qe is proping up the prices of financial assets that should have been worth 0 so he is n't too far off . 
  qe has been shown to increase inequality . 
  the extra liquidity also made financial players take on more risk than they should have : https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2408174 https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15211.pdf, 
  so are you the expert ? 
  care to explain what quantitative easing is ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative_easing  central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions , thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield , while simultaneously increasing the money supply . 
  this is what the central bank is doing .
