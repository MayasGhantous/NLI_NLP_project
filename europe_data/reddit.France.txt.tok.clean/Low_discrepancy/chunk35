  we need local policing when those 2000 jihadists return to europe . 
  that 's what 'll solve the issue . 
  you know what ? 
  all those terrorists that attacked in france and lived in france , they were on a file . 
  they were known to be extremists . 
  we need to help the intelligence services . 
   `` we 've been preparing for this sort of thing since 9/11 , horrible but unsurprising , and certainly a case to be learned from '' the us had it bad in size but you know what ? 
  it was n't local terrorism . 
  this is local terrorism and we 'll have more until we become disgusted and start doing real change . 
  local police work , that 's not friggin change . 
  honestly , i 'm against any terry leaving jail before they become s\u00e9nile . 
  ca n't help it if i 'm bilingual . 
  trilingual actually . 
  why would terries target jewish targets when others like that bataclan would cause more victims ? 
  it 's about spreading fear . 
   because of the small wages , noone really cared up until now who these people are and how they feel about our laws , our ways and our values . 
  what 're some of the safest european countries ? 
  poland . 
  what country has n't had a terrorist attack in 20 years ? 
  romania . 
  those countries are ** poor ** . 
  what is the european community that is most despised in europe ? 
  the gypsies . 
  2 million in romania . 
  both a lot of romanians and a lot of gypsies live in dirt poor conditions where they take their water 1 km down the road from fountains . 
  * yes * is it a hard life , but ** terrorism is 0 ** . 
  enough with the retarded propaganda : poor people cause terrorism, 
   he might not have known any exact details , and you ca n't lock a city down for days/weeks with no concrete details . 
  the police were still looking for a couple of guys . 
  guys that again were part of a terrorist plot that killed 130 people in france . 
  they were dangerous . 
  honestly man . 
  they were making their explosives in belgium . 
  they had hideouts . 
  what warrants a lock down then ? 
  sadly , after all these attacks , the bar for `` sensational '' attacks starts being pushed higher and higher . 
  il collabore . 
  il ne maintient pas son droit au silence '' translation `` abdeslam gives auditions for 2 hours and after the info is in the press . 
  i think he is of vital importance in this investigation . 
  i 'd even say he 's worth his weight in gold . 
  he 's collaborating . 
  he 's communicating . 
  he is n't maintaining he 's right to remain silent ''  j\u2019ai dit qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait des informations d\u2019une valeur inestimable pour l\u2019enqu\u00eate mais je n\u2019ai jamais dit qu\u2019il voulait devenir un repenti translation :  i said that he has invaluable information for the investigation but i never said he wants to repent . 
  so take what you will . 
   problem is one of those options sells a lot better than the other . 
  if you know there 're a couple of terrorists on the run , and the situation is serious , why did n't bruxelles go in lock down mode ? 
  well we knew too late for bruxelles . 
  that 's not very helpful . 
  his lawyer also blasted about how much he was cooperating . 
  but the thing that is odd : the belgians knew the he was planning an attack , why did n't they go in full lockdown ? 
  makes me think abdeslam was n't / is n't really collaborating . 
   prosecutors might have been better served to not say whether he was cooperating or not . 
  well his lawyer said to the press that he was fully cooperating and he 's not maintaining his right to remain silent . 
  let 's face it , he 'll play the `` i did n't know anything about it '' card . 
   a lot of dodging and nonsense replies , you should be in politics . 
  no , no . 
  he 's my idol . 
  1 point if you figure why . 
   look up what a hypothetical is , it 's a waste of time talking to you when you 're purposely ignoring what 's being stated and instead imagining something else . 
  can you point to such a case without insulting ? 
  thank you . 
   this is one of the most inane argument i 've ever seen someone try to make on reddit . 
  i started half assing it 30 mins ago . 
  i 'm [ falkenhayning it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_verdun#aftermath ), 
  in france there was a debate about binationals having their citizenship revoked for terrorist reasons . 
  many people ( the former justice minister ) thought that french with north-african nationalities will feel targeted unjustly . 
  that is dumb . 
  i am a binational , the law would apply to me too , but i do not feel targeted since ... well it 's obvious why . 
  this is a law for those convicted of terrorist charges . 
  that is by no means scalable . 
  norway has a population of 5 million . 
  that 's about 1/3 of the parisian region . 
  can you not insult people ? 
  i explained why lybia was n't the cause for terrorism since other countries were there and had no problem . 
  there is no political will to act . 
  to give proper financing . 
  but we all know these are n't random attacks from random people . 
  sometimes i have to struggle to produce them . 
   okay let 's say someone disagrees with france 's actions in libya for example and is radicalised by that . 
  uk participated in lybia . 
  so did the us . 
  there were no terrorist strikes in the uk . 
  so ** no ** . 
  lybia did n't create the current french terrorism . 
  just like belgium did n't intervene in lybia . 
  so if your question is : has the intervention in lybia create terrorism then the answer is ** no ** . 
   i disagree . 
  i 've never once in all my political activism seen a single person fear that anti-terror action will have that effect . 
  you do n't know france and the recent debates we had i see . 
   t . it can be genuinely hard to tell the difference , and there are super sensitive is our former justice minister super sensitive ? 
  maybe . 
  but let 's not say she 's a minor figure . 
   the issue is that a lot of them only become known after the fact , so instead of focusing on the problematic group they blanket the entire population under draconian surveillance and security laws for fear of being discriminatory . 
  everyone loses . 
  ** every ** terrorist that has hit france and was living in france had a file from the secret services . 
  there are about 10k people on that file . 
  sure not all are terries , not all will commit a crime and some are on the list for random reasons . 
  by 10k out of 65 million is sure narrowing it down . 
  if it was created by a random phrase generator i wo n't answer it . 
  i refuse to talk to a robot .
