  as long as the enemy wo n't ever bother attacking you 've won . 
   and still russia has a stronger and better organized military . 
  quite embarrassing . 
  do they now ? 
  they lost how many planes because they could n't land on their wacky aircraft carrier ? 
  they 're fine against weak adversaries like ukraine , georgia or rebels that ca n't be bothered to fly a plane . 
  and all your articles exclude the parts where the germans really excel like submarines or special forces or small arms or the leopard tanks . 
  did n't moldova just vote a president that is basically putin 's puppet ? 
  how is that possible ? 
  i 'll just save your comment if i ever need it and say it was i that wrote it . 
  suck it : o, 
   well , not really , i just denied them  i 'll try to read better in the future next time  . 
   i ca n't seem to find anything about the quote online . 
  well i 'm interested if you ever find something . 
  / r/dataisugly besides that , number 3 baffles me . 
  we 're so in favour for abortion yet fillon voted no in many laws regarding [ abortion ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/12/02/avortement-non-francois-fillon-n-a-pas-vote-toutes-les-lois-qui-ont-permis-l-acces-a-l-ivg_5041905_4355770.html ) like extension to 12 weeks to ask for one or it being reimbursed by the social security . 
  and le pen 's niece is very much for restricting abortion . 
  we 're so for it yet have high chances of having a leader like that . 
  see . 
  that 's the problem with chatting on reddit . 
  one makes a dumbass comment and you have to write a friggin essay to properly disprove it . 
  i gave up . 
  ( not that i ever tried ), 
  are there any yes `` yes-stop '' zones ? 
   but the crucible steel theory is n't widely accepted anyway what are other variants ? 
  and what other sources could have produced the high quality steel that comes from certain ulfberhts ? 
   not only are ulfberht swords frankish were n't some of the ulfberhts actually forged ? 
  who made these forgeries ? 
   ... it is a primary source , a 12th century letter . 
  so a trace should exist of it . 
   http://library.philadelphia.edu.jo/scripts/minisa.dll/144/libcat/en_detail/accession_number+83219?sessionsearch uhm . 
  fiona macdonald is a children 's book author . 
  you can see it in your link :  subject headings saladin , sultan of egypt and syria , 1137-1193 -- juvenile literature crusades -- juvenile literature and here 's a website that talks about her : http://www.babelio.com/auteur/fiona-macdonald/130639 i tried to google it but could n't find it . 
   you are the one with the claims . 
  we both made claims here . 
  and you either want to go to the bottom of the stories or you wan na swing dicks , holier than thou , and sling shit . 
  it 's up to you . 
   the issue in the original statement was between japan and europe , not china and europe . 
  well i 'm sure this thread was instructive to many people as it was for me . 
  one should not fear knowledge . 
   europe had a mass of blast furnaces since the 13th century and produced enormous amounts of high quality product considering that the oldest blast furnace is in china some 1000 years before the first ones made in europe , i wo n't start to assume we had some exceptional steel that other regions of the globe did n't have . 
   you do n't have to , you still provided nothing , neither have you . 
  you claim that saladin said that . 
  give me a link to the original document saying that . 
  sauces , 
   you have to beg on the streets dont you dude , you need a little bit of hunger . 
  did you see how many of you are obese ? 
   you wear rags hey do n't get salty cuz we 're more fashionable than whatever crap ivanka makes . 
   we have thousands of brands lol yes . 
  all in size xxxl, 
   about 99.99 % of swords forged in europe at the time were not made out of that type of ingots . 
    heck , the majority of swords made in india or the middle east at the time were n't crucible steel either . 
  of course not . 
  it was n't an easy procedure to produce great quantities . 
  i was contradicting this quote from / u/dyki _ tantsi :  european swords were superior in quality at this time because they had access to better quality materials and europeans already made swords for several thousand years in reality , european steel up to the 1750s was run of the mill and had nothing special compared to other parts of the world . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2lx0za/was_medieval_europe_able_to_produce_exceptional/ but in many places in india , central asia , they produced crucible steel which was quite exceptional . 
   like seriously , can anyone actually source any of that bullshit ? 
  that damascus steel was made in syria before the crusaders came ? 
  https://books.google.fr/books?id=x7e8rhl1lf4c&amp;pg=pa80&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false also this article with these sources : http://materials.iisc.ernet.in/~wootz/heritage/wootz.htm  there are numerous early literary references to steel from india from mediterranean sources including one from the time of alexander ( 3rd c. bc ) who was said to have been presented with 100 talents of indian steel , mentioned by pant [ 1 ] . 
  bronson [ 2 ] has summarised several accounts of the reputation of indian iron and steel in greek and roman sources which suggest the export of high quality iron and steel from ancient india . 
  srinivasan [ 3 ] , biswas [ 4 ] and srinivasan and griffiths [ 5 ] have pointed out that the archaeological evidence from the region of tamil nadu suggests that the indian crucible steel process is likely to have started before the christian era from that region . 
  zaky [ 6 ] pointed out that it was the arabs who took ingots of wootz steel to damascus following which a thriving industry developed there for making weapons and armour of this steel , the renown of which has given the steel its name . 
  in the 12th century the arab edrisi mentioned that the hindus excelled in the manufacture of iron and that it was impossible to find anything to surpass the edge from indian steel , and he also mentioned that the indians had workshops where the most famous sabres in the world were forged , while other arab records mention the excellence of hinduwani or indian steel as discussed by egerton [ 7 ] . 
  & nbsp ;  strange and quite contradictory , is n't it ? 
  * 1 ) bullshitting . 
  * 2 ) the source does n't actually exist . 
  unless you can provide to me a photo with the letter . 
  i 'll ask some arabic friends to help in translating . 
   the crucible steel imported by the vikings has nothing to do with the development of metallurgy in europe and further swordmaking yeah . 
  the highest quality ulfberhts were made from very high quality steel . 
  and we know that they traded with central asia through the volga . 
  and once that trade route was closed , the high quality ulfs stopped getting made . 
  clearly we have no ideas . 
   both are inferior to scandinavian tech . 
  the scandinavians did n't have any crucibles so they could n't make crucible steel . 
  the metal they had was inferior . 
   just the usual website blabber . 
  https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328502-600-lost-treasures-miraculous-damascus-steel/  european crusaders returned home with tales of islamic warriors wielding blades that could slice through a floating handkerchief , bend 90 degrees and flex back with no damage . 
  they called the metal damascus steel . 
  despite centuries of advances in material science , exactly how the islamic swordsmiths created it is still unknown . 
  we can play this game all day long . 
   utterly ridiculous statement deserving of mockery . 
  that was part of the myths created around the metal . 
  you understand the differences ? 
  at least we have multiple brands . 
  you just have one and your supreme leader cheeto in chief told you to buy that . 
   no evidence of it being appreciated in europe at the time . 
  http://www.claysmithguns.com/knives_history.htm  damascus steel was the name that the crusaders gave to the steel that they had witnessed slicing through their own , lesser quality swords , cutting the sword in half in a single swipe without ever losing its edge . 
  the next swipe would do the same to the body of that less fortunate crusader . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/29/science/the-mystery-of-damascus-steel-appears-solved.html  the remarkable characteristics of damascus steel became known to europe when the crusaders reached the middle east , beginning in the 11th century . 
   no evidence that the ingots were from india or even central asia , it is mere wishful speculation . 
  so we have no evidence that vikings or frankish had crucible steel . 
  and we know that they did trade with central asia . 
  we also know that damascus steel was very appreciated ( missnomer here , that steel also came from india ) . 
  so i guess that indeed , it 's a huge unsolvable mystery . 
   also , there is still no evidence of that viking crucible steel was imported from india in the first place , there is ** no ** proof that vikings had crucibles while there is sufficient evidence that they had trade with central asia , through the [ volga route ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_trade_route ) . 
  and some of the ulfbert swords show very high quality steel produced in central asia . 
   you cant afford either oh , they president the new ivanka collection during spicey 's press conference ? 
  how nice is it ? 
  what will you buy ?
