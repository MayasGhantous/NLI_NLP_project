   rapey sheep . 
  i 'm sure you think they asked for it . 
  i tried to extend an olive branch by repeating what your cheeto in chief is saying : buy ivanka crap ; it 's awesome . 
   bretagne , elsass , corsica , catalonian and basque regions . 
  i like how you wanted to seem edgy by giving the corsican name of corsica but did n't bother putting in breizh , els\u00e0ss , catalunya or euskal herria . 
  just makes you look like a lazy troll man . 
   what people do n't know is that already the vikings used this smithing technique , making japan about a thousand or so years behind europe in the development . 
  i think / u/narwi is saying that the technique was simply used to remove impurities . 
  and once the vikings had access to good quality steel , they did n't need any type of folding techniques anymore . 
  the high quality steel was obtained from the indians since they invented crucible steel . 
   we own you . 
  go buy some crappy ivanka shit . 
  you ca n't afford french stuff . 
   they had access to better quality materials and europeans already made swords for several thousand years . '', 
  yup . 
  thanks to the indians for inventing crucible steel . 
  nice little doc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftlmrah1ohi, 
   but ps , ump and modem deputies were interviewed during the 2010 crisis and they did n't exclude the possibility , even if a united belgium is more realistic to their eyes . 
  what ? 
  fine give sources . 
   in what it 's `` extremely different '' ? 
  look at : * / u/grelow https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtfuhe/ * / u/bittersweet-world https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddthinv/ * / u/a-sa-la - ma https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtevik/ * / u/piekenier https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtkohc/ all dutch flairs that are clamoring on how awesome a union would be with flanders . 
  how they should totally do it because they 're totally just brothers temporarely separated but they 'll just unite . 
  feelings also expressed by other dutch like : * / u/dvtxc https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtlutn/ * / u/stuijfsande https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtpblc/ * / u/nabulionebuonaparte https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtr066/ the only belgian that speaks favourably is / u/iamagermanshepherd https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtigmv/ while also admitting that there is no actual support in flanders for that . 
  the rest of the few belgians that do speak actually point out the differences between the countries saying they can not go over those differences . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtoouv/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtfno5/ only french that did talk about it is / u/kerankou https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ue792/unified_benelux_oc_fictional_map/ddtovnz/ of course this is banter , but even banter creates a state of mind . 
  the dutch on this thread seem to be fixated on flanders ( because how big bros they are , how stronk of an economy they 'd be ) , the flemish are like , neah we 're fine we just want more autonomy and we 're in the eu anyway . 
  and in france ... this topic is non-existent . 
  except you claim it 's this thing that exists , even though you 're not french . 
   maybe you should change your attitude about the very serious problems facing your country oh man . 
  we 'd get some pretty fine cured meat with the salt you 've got . 
  well i 'd also be salty with a laughing stock president like cheeto benito . 
   thank you for trying to talk like an american  least common denominator . 
   good luck with all the african and arab muslim migrants raping the young girls of your country , though . 
  damn . 
  you salty boy . 
   your military is a joke finally we 're at the level of your president we tried hard . 
  congratz on winning iraq and afghanistan btw . 
  great success 2 trillion dollars , 5000 us soldiers dead . 
  but the world is much safer amirite , 
   french politicians are not against rattachism you use french politicians very freely . 
  except some extreme right politicians that may at one point or another talked about it , the french population does n't really care . 
  heck extreme right politicians even bitch that algeria was let go ...  france is not against to welcome this new region . 
  well the dutch i hear in this thread are actively campaigning for a dissolution of belgium ... so it seems extremely different than what you 're talking about . 
  mmmm . 
  i love that nordic sea salt . 
  now shooo , you got ta vote for trump nb 2 . 
  maybe for 2016 it would have been useful . 
   language is considered useless . 
  who even speaks the 5th most spoken language ? 
   french politicians are not against since when ? 
  why did nobody tell me that ? 
  for a free qu\u00e9bec sure , but wallonie ... meh . 
  they seem happy that way . 
   secret eu pipes the channel tunnel is n't exactly secret man . 
   to avoid nuclear war ( or conventional war ) . 
  yeah . 
  that 's why we nuked algeria . 
  get real buddy . 
  i 'm the islamist : /, 
   the previous guy is complaining about the european allies free-riding the nato aliance and basically not being able to even so much as patrol their own near-abroad without us help . 
  nato is a military cooperation . 
  and ** the only country ** that has ever invoked art 5 up to now was the us . 
  have you ** ever ** heard of a frenchman complaining before about the dead french soldiers in your afghanistan war ? 
  how about all that french equipment that was used in the afghanistan war ? 
  so why are you bitching about 5 kcs and 5 c130 you supplied in mali . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_forces_in_afghanistan how about the aircraft carrier that participated in afghanistan , how about the 4000 soldiers there , how about the 1700 sorties ? 
  seems to me that the us participation in libya was absolutely dwarfed by the french participation in all the operation the us organised post 9/11 . 
  so it 's pretty dumb to hear cheeto benito fans scream about how they want their money back . 
   not only is this generally the case , but it 's also the case that washington has been complaining about this for at least 10 years , regardless of administration . 
  ever heard of low-hanging fruits ? 
  i 'm sure that the spaniards saw it that way , 
  goddamit , you and your stupid facts . 
  i wan na bash on some europeans and muslims, 
  yes i 'm sure spaniards at the time was quite happy with the moor occupation . 
  that 's how they saw it , as enlightened foreigners bringing them money , nice buildings and culture . 
  do you often think your own opinions are historic fact ? 
  dude you could have said gypsies and it would have fit what you 're looking for . 
  the you 'd get a ton of replies how huge thiefs gypsies are and how they do n't work at all only expecting benefits . 
  that would deffo convince you there 's no anti-gypsy stigma . 
  dude , let the dude overreach . 
  do n't block that with logic and shit . 
  aww . 
  you salty :d . are you salty cuz cheeto benito has made you the laughing stock of the world ? 
  i ca n't wait for cheeto 's show to start in a few hours . 
  i wonder what crazy stunts he 'll pull  ) maybe drain the swamp a bit more by putting another gs exec in his administration . 
   that is why you have to provide reimbursement to us . 
  when you 'll pay a pension to the wives and families of the dead french soldiers in afghanistan , we 'll reimburse you . 
  until then , go back to your cheeto benito shit show . 
   american achievements provided 5 kcs in mali . 
  hardly an achievement . 
  but if you want to take glory for libya , you can . 
  apparently everything the us touches turns to shit . 
   and what would you want your country to do if russia nukes , say , poland ? 
  that 's a different problem and raises the bar for nuclear war . 
  but if the war is conventional and france is n't threatened ... no nukes . 
  if russia does n't use nukes , we wo n't use them . 
  it 's a normal attitude . 
   russia from annexing a nato country and putting it under nuclear protection if the nuclear powers in nato wo n't react ? 
  so ... you want france to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on bucharest ?
