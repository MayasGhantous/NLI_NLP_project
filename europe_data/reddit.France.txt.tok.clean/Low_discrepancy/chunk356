  romania 's minimum wage since the 2nd of fev 2017 is [ 320 euros ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/salariu_minim_pe_economie#salariul_minim_pe_economie_.c3.aen_rom.c3.a2nia ) . 
  in 2008 it was 139 , the change was of ** 130 % ** . 
  the highest rate of change in europe . 
  the minimum wage doubled and then some in 9 years . 
  let 's see if the economy will crumble . 
  i doubt it . 
   a trade agreement would be great we would buy cheaper , win win that 's up to us . 
  we can lower any tax we want and raise them at will if there 's dumping . 
  in an fta we lose this freedom . 
  that 's because you do n't know how the fn works and the different branches corresponding to the different areas of france . 
  you 're still presenting the view of fn from 20 years ago . 
   this is the perfect time to force more of your crap on their markets i 'm sorry to break this to you but : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/vietnam/  the ** eu has a negative balance of trade in goods with vietnam . 
  ** in 2014 , eu-vietnam trade in goods was worth over $ 28.3 billion , with $ 22.1 billion in imports from vietnam into the eu , $ 6.2 billion in exports from the eu to vietnam . 
  emphasis mine . 
  we have a trade deficit of some 22-6 = 16 billion euros . 
  we 're buying far far more than we 're selling to them . 
   he said something like `` if hamon and melanchon get together , i would vote for them without any doubt , unfortunately it 's not going to happen so i 'm voting to leave the eu '' . 
  for someone whose main goal is to leave the eu that seems like a type of a strategy . 
  hamon basically is the only one that gives a palatable vision for the eu in mi opinion . 
  * ending austerity by massively investing in renewables , * social and fiscal convergence that will also help stop the race to the bottom that we see with countries like ireland , netherlands and others regarding taxes * a new agreement on asylum since dublin is ridiculous * removing the defense budget from the maastricht criteria . 
  he has a vision because the eu needs reforms . 
  and if reforms are not carried out ... maybe it 's time to pull the plug and do something new . 
  one has to be nimble in today 's society . 
  so peugeots that cost 4 years of the average salary , snecma turbojet engines and fine bordeaux wines that cost 5 days of the average salary ? 
  i 'm a bit skeptical about that ... 
  okay ... so we can be certain that this fta wo n't pass . 
   not that i think it 's bad , the eu needs a policy like that , just like it needs one for the east . 
  congratulations , we have it already https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_neighbourhood_policy and that 's enough . 
  the eu is not in the business of proping up dictators . 
   great . 
  tunisia is probably the best investment in na . 
  just like i think belarus is a great investment for poland . 
  but the eu has no business there . 
   we would sell things to them too yes ? 
  german cars ? 
  french aerospace tech ? 
  what exactly can you sell them ? 
   she is the presidential candidate of her party , she is the party 's core beliefs , personified . 
  what ? 
  ps had hollande as a candidate . 
  now they have hamon which could n't be more different . 
  hollande actually ruled even though the party was split in two . 
  no she is n't the personification of ** all ** the beliefs in her party , just like trump or clinton were not . 
  we did n't offer any of those countries some `` offer that they can not refuse '' like / u/kternic mentions . 
  these are simply agreements to stem the migrant flow and that affects all major eu countries . 
  and france does give tunisia money http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20160122-france-pledges-one-billion-euros-aid-troubled-tunisia-essid-meets-hollande if poland can offer them a cool billion ... go for it man . 
  speaking of fn , its senior staff is still heavily connected with vichyist `` elite '' , that 's irrelevant . 
  fn does not exist beyond mlp . 
  they will never achieve any sort of majority in the parlament . 
  with mlp president , she 'll have to cohabitate severely hindering both president and parlament . 
  otoh she can launch refs . 
   stop being ridiculous . 
  https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf here 's a few researchers from my institute that discovered this problem https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/https-crippling-attack-threatens-tens-of-thousands-of-web-and-mail-servers/ nice to know the ethics presentations i had when i began my phd do n't apply to germany . 
   i wish polish foreign relations with belarus were based on actual interests fine . 
  but we 're talking about the eu . 
  if poland can foot the bill , give lukashenko that offer he can not refuse , be my guest . 
  that 's what france is doing with algeria . 
  but the eu is not in the business of sponsoring dictators . 
  nice to see that the police and intelligence forces are more pro-active and efficient in dealing with these problems . 
   it is n't like we should close the door because he is a dictator because ? 
   if he moves towards democracy i would n't mind if eu was in talks with him . 
  if he steps down and a democratic election happens ... of course . 
  dgse does not subcontract others to spy on the french citizens because of hypocritical rights . 
  and there is a political party on the horizon that does want to cut military cooperation concerning these matters with the us . 
   unless you are doing it on behalf of your govt . 
  some colleagues are doing work in internet security , cracking crypto systems etc. 
  they 'll be happy to know that the playing is larger than previously expected . 
   you are not a government . 
  govt worker . 
   and lucky i work at an institute that just does that . 
  i 'll tell some of my colleagues that it 's okay to hack german computers . 
  no bad will come of it . 
   they only apply on german soil . 
  yeah . 
  we know germans like to export their problems to neighboring countries . 
  we had to visit some . 
  nice to see old habits do n't die out . 
   if you want to bring belarus to the western club , you should support lukashenko and just make him an offer , he ca n't resist . 
  if poland want to make them an offer they can not refuse , then the country is free to do so . 
  we 're not asking the eu to give algeria an offer they can not refuse ... so do return the favour . 
  if it 's in your benefit ... go for it . 
   and getting access to the asian emerging market we make high added value goods that are quite expensive and vietnam with a gdp per capita of 5000 ppp dollars are not exactly a very capable of market to buy our goods . 
  the only reason for this fta would be to maybe get lower prices on shoes , clothes and some other stuff . 
  i hardly think that 's essential really . 
   it helps to improve the position against china china has a gdp per capita of 11k ppp dollars . 
  that 's twice as much as vietnam and with a population of 1.3 billion ... we 'll have to make china our partner . 
  really do n't see much of a benefit from this fta other than vietnam selling more goods and making more money . 
  that is an expression of values . 
  as uk has shown countries wo n't disintegrate once they 're out of the eu . 
  and even out of the eu , france will remain pivotal to europe . 
  see ... 
  there 's reasons on both sides of the aisle . 
  yeah . 
  it 's a none . 
  we baaaarely wanted to do a fta with canada and they 're a country that is quite small and has about the same labour standards as europe . 
  maybe i 'm following different news , but the mood in europe is not towards more ftas , especially with countries that can undercut the europeans through weaker labour laws . 
   it was just the common market yeah where workers from one country could go seek work in another ... 
  it 's bull because you seem to not understand politics . 
  a politician has an implicit contract with the people so that when elected to try and perform the promises made in the campaign , if they wish to continue remaining a politician . 
  just because something is not law , does n't mean you can ignore it .
