  if it was a question produced by the human mind , i want to know what were the reasons for such a question . 
  what created that `` if '' . 
  did a random phrase generator create it ? 
  you are being asked how the french state is reponsible for creating terrorists . 
  you claim that is possible . 
  state your reasons . 
  wtf are you talking , are you xenophobic or something ? 
  a french is not more likely to commit a terrorist attack than an irish , a british , an italian whatever . 
  since when it xenophobic speech allowed here ? 
   if a french citizen becomes a terrorist , for whatever reason , do you not believe france has a responsibility ? 
  why would france have any responsability ? 
  state your reasons . 
   so if a french citizen ( for example ) becomes a terrorist , you do n't think france has some responsibility there ? 
  how ? 
  state your reasons . 
  inline you , i do n't projet so i have no clue what you 're talking about . 
   why should that be legal ? 
  again : i stated my reasons . 
   that 's not doing anything except trying to absolve yourself of any responsibility . 
  what responsability ? 
  40 years is the facto . 
  life is de jure . 
  let 's be honest no one stays for life . 
  which i agree , why should i pay for an old dude that can barely hold himself . 
  let him out in the world , make a living . 
  the `` without trial '' is ** all ** in your head . 
  ** all ** . 
  why do you expect a conversation with people if in reality you 're projecting ? 
   and they should n't . 
   and it 's illegal right now and should remain so . 
  because ? 
  other than it gots to stay like that ? 
  i doubt it . 
  he said he was planning attacks in belgium . 
  might be parallel construction also . 
  who knows . 
  `` generally '' means nothing when law systems are involved . 
  it 's either illegal or it is not . 
  in the case of france it would be legal if the parliament passes a law in that respect . 
  neah in the case if france , sarkozy `` re-organise '' the services . 
  it was a mess . 
  well the act has been done . 
  of course no . 
  we should punish hard terrorists not muslims . 
  people tend to confuse the two on both sides of the spectrum : oh if we punish the terrorists too hard the muslims will think we 're focusing on them . 
  and on the right end of the political spectrum it is the same thing . 
   treat them as the murderers and shit sacks that they are , and properly apply the full weight of the law . 
  they are not simple murderes or sacks of shit . 
  they are not simple serial killers . 
  they have an ideology backing them . 
  he is a military man after all . 
  you can also mention sven mary ( the lawyer of abdeslam ) that said that his client is fully compliant and has not renounced his right to remain silent . 
  yeah ... apparently abdeslam forgot a few things . 
  thanks mary . 
  heh , you 're right !, 
  we should then also stop any of the policies and politicians that will result in us seeing our isis fighters returing home peacefully . 
  france has the highest number of isis fighters from the western world . 
  belgium beats france in per capita numbers . 
  we 'll have a fun few years in europe . 
  he was right just once . 
  if we stop erdogan we 're increase his accuracy by 100 % . 
   abdelsalam was found through a suspicious pizza delivery . 
  crazy times we living in . 
  that 's a bit too quick . 
  the chain of events : * 6 policemen were checking an apartment they thought was abandoned ( rented by someone suspected to be a terrorist ) . 
  * abdeslam was in there , shootings start , he escapes . 
  panicked he calls friends to a hideout . 
  * one of the friends he calls informs the police of his phone number * the police use that to track it to several possible locations . 
  * in one area , someone makes a large pizza order , so they suspect more he 's there . 
  if you read the news , you 'll see they raided other parts in brussels like jette . 
   removing one 's citizenship is not doing anything to adress the problem itself no one believes that citizenship removal would solve terrorism . 
  people are just saying that citizenship is an important aspect , it is something you strive for , it is not just a piece of paper . 
  if someone commit an act of treason , they can get the worst punishments . 
  terrorism should be considered as treason . 
  you desire the destruction of your country . 
  if there were a button a terrorist could push to destroy his or her country , that terrorist would push it . 
  symbols are important . 
  we fight for flags . 
  100 years ago people died to put the french or german flag on a piece of muddy land . 
  for that tiny symbol . 
  why do terrorists burn their passport and film it ? 
  it is a symbol . 
   for real , how can people still not see that taking everything away from a person only helps extremism . 
  i am a binational . 
  i would also risk being deprived of my citizenship if i commit terrorist attacks . 
  you ** can not ** render a terrorism more extreme that he or she already is . 
  and a binational like myself does not feel more inclined to terrorism . 
  heck i even support that measure . 
  man do n't you know . 
  the san bernadino terrorists were like suuper poor . 
  they only had iphones . 
  that 's cheap-ass poor man . 
  also look at the spike in terorist attacks in poland , romania . 
  it 's obvious : poor leads to terrorism . 
  how can you not see it ? 
   the end result in this case i think , leads us to poverty . 
  okay let 's start here . 
  what is the group of people that are the poorest and most descriminated against in europe ? 
  okay okay i know the gypsies . 
  they even went through the holocaust .
