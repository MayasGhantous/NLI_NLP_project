  the only major power the french president has it to disolve the national assembly ... so he can time it and hope the people will vote for a parlament that is more like him . 
  otoh , the us president has the power to veto laws , basically blocking congress . 
   j'attends des \u00e9l\u00e9ments plus concrets . 
   does n't write she wants to send leftist teachers to be `` re-educated '' . 
  well i mean melenchon does n't talk often about how the medias need to be reigned in . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gspzxqgraxw here 's a guy from le diplo telling melenchon that the big mistake of govts in ecuador , venezuela and greece was to not have `` a strong '' media reform policy . 
  he also says that any critique of these govts was not true criticism but a way for the neo-liberals to undermine and `` fragilise '' these govts . 
  that 's what you get with extremes . 
  they 're slimy things but sometimes they can be useful to tear down the current establishment when it is no longer effective . 
  you can see it for yourself when you said you wan na vote melenchon to tear down the 5th republic . 
   you think she wo n't immediately ` change her mind ' ( let 's be honest , she has n't changed her mind in the first place ) if she gets her hands on power ? 
  what 's the reason to vote then ? 
  what makes you think any candidate wo n't change their opinions once they get in power ? 
  what 's the reason to vote ? 
   farage claimed to have stopped wanting to privatise the nhs after there was a video which leaked showing him saying as such , then the day after the referendum he 's back on tv talking about a privatised nhs . 
  trump ... well , trump says a lot of things , but i do n't personally consider ` draining the swamp ' to include hiring exxon officials and repealing dumping measures . 
  well farange is a former trader with a lot of business ties . 
  trump is a businessman . 
  between le pen and the french business world there is little love . 
  if you 're bothered about business getting access to power , you 'd be more bothered by macron . 
   i 'll recant if anything nasty turns up about marcon http://www.ledauphine.com/france-monde/2017/01/25/macron-accuse-d-avoir-utilise-des-fonds-de-bercy-pour-lancer-sa-campagne, 
  she already backed down on the death penalty which was , at least for me , my number one reason for not voting for her . 
  another 5 more years like the previous and she 'll get 45 % at the second round . 
  another 5 years and she 'll win . 
  it 's a watershed moment for the eu , with uk leaving . 
  we got promised massive reforms . 
  let 's see them delivered . 
  would we want to become like italy with 17 years of zero growth ? 
   and while i 'm ok with vat that 's because you do n't pay fucking vat . 
  only end consumers pay vat . 
  so the desire is for the other branches of the party to manifest themselves ? 
  okay . 
   psd will go from 45 % to 15 - 20 % guaranteed , no matter what will happen until then . 
  eh , there was the mineriad , there were the 90s with huge inflation , disastrous privatisations , the early 00s with the corruption of nastase and the local barons , colectiv scandal , etc etc etc. 
  who would have guessed that after colectiv , psd would get 45 % ? 
  until romania does n't get an actual very much needed left wing party alternative ... psd will still be there , strong and lurking ... getting power from time to time . 
  someone should make a bot that tracks your cummulative karma levels over time as i am curious . 
   about the parties and parliament govt resigning is about parties and parlament . 
  how 's your karma evolution before and after brexit ? 
  with a majority of the parlament psd & com the new govt will just be a rehash of the previous . 
  why would they trigger snap elections when they 've got 3.5 + years to make people forget this fuck-up ? 
  i 'm answering to / u/linknewtab who was talking about some really exciting reforms macron is proposing ... let 's wait for him to post them before we get excited about how great they are . 
  [ but did you see how many eu flags < 3 . 
  so ... what are the reforms precisely ? 
  you gave me his desire for reform ( which is a given in the current political climate ) and areas where reform should be carried out ( which basically include all areas ) but the only thing you did n't give me are the actual reforms . 
  heck , look at his websites : https://en-marche.fr/en-marche/ no reforms !, 
  the issue was taxation without representation . 
  nowadays though , i bet americans would be happy to pay to not be represented by trump . 
   it was leopold 's personal property after all . 
  i am glad to see the belgians have a strong respect of private property . 
   this could actually lead to real reforms and accelerate the integration process in the eu . 
  you know macron 's policies ? 
  cuz we 're kinda left in the dark here in france . 
   that is what you get for sucking up to autocrats . 
  you understand that you 're talking about lukashenko here , right ? 
  we love our politics and our presidential elections . 
  we regularly hit 80 % turnout which is quite high indeed compared to other countries . 
   erm , is n't the job of those destroyers to be a gigantic target to protect more important ships ? 
  why did they design it with features meant to [ reduce the radar signature ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_45_destroyer#/media/file:hms_daring-1.jpg ), 
   warships are not meant to be stealthy/silent . 
  you should tell these guys that they have no clue what they 're doing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stealth_ship looking at the ship in question , you can see that they 're doing quite a bit of work to reduce [ radar cross section ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_45_destroyer#/media/file:hms_daring-1.jpg ), 
   and it 's just not possible , says whom ? 
  did you actually do the macroeconomic studies that showed that a minimum wage increase would be impossible ? 
   it took 6 years to go from 130 euros to 260 , which is double , but it started from a very low base . 
  260 is a very low base for a european salary . 
  and when you see that unemployment is low in romania , a minimum wage increase is totally feasible . 
  psd promised a minimum income of 388 . 
  that 's a very feasible goal to reach in 4-6 years . 
  have another party promise the same thing and you 'll see votes going to those people . 
  i see very little facts or studies behind your claim that rising minimum to 350 euros for example in some time would destroy the romanian economy . 
  and concerning this little lady , remove the flat income tax because it just creates inequality , and with the money obtained , you pay better pensions . 
  flat taxes favour the rich that hoard money . 
  poor people like this woman are too poor to hoard money and they directly inject it into the economy . 
   is n't enough to double them & nbsp ;  destroy the macroeconomic stability of the country and then be forced to cut them . 
  [ romanian minimu wage doubles in 6 years ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=ml9s8a132hlg_&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;idim=country:ro:bg:hu&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr ) . 
  did that destroy the macroeconomic stability of the country ? 
   not accepting a letter of credence of a foreign dignitary would afaik be an unprecedented move in diplomatic circles and would certainly lead to some interesting outcomes . 
  vatican did n't accept a french ambassador because he was gay . 
   if i had the luxury of choosing my opponent , ambassadors are not meant to be opponents . 
   the best of people it seems often come from humble , pious , and unfortunately perhaps miserable backgrounds . 
  they learn to find joy in other people . 
  [ here 's a rank of empathy by country ] ( http://www.sciencealert.com/the-most-empathetic-countries-in-the-world-have-just-been-ranked ) . 
  seems that besides several exceptions , being in a developped country does help with empathy . 
   while she likes working and is proud of doing it because she likes to be useful to society , she 's forced to do it because her survivorship pension is n't enough to survive . 
  raise the level of the goddamn pensions . 
  romania has one of the fastest growing economies in the eu . 
  if you 'd have a different political force than the psd woukd strongly go after the poor people vote ( increased pensions , increased minimum wage ) , maybe you would n't have such a big psd vote in the parlament . 
   if only some footage existed !, 
  yeah . 
  bbc does tend to peddle nazi propaganda . 
   does this mean belarus is moving more towards the eu ? 
  what move can there be as long as lukashenko is in charge ? 
  [ they 're not even part of the ecthr ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/council_of_europe_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg ), 
   what about rotterdam ? 
  really restraining . 
  britain was no netherlands nor poland and hitler had different plans for each . 
  in the case of uk , they wanted them to be part of the new european project the nazis had in mind as they were allies . 
  churchill did n't order the bombing of berlin because of rotterdam or warsaw so it 's pointless to talk about them . 
   it was a legit military target . 
  and it was daring raid .
