   good intentioned progressivism from the torries and may that wants to pull uk out of the ecthr ...  but it 's not so much the government does n't respect free speech so you agree people should be arrested for saying : `` i asked a muslim woman to explain the brussels attack '' . 
  noice  heck i really hope uk will get out of the ecthr . 
  the amount of pop-corn ... 
   however , that is a free speech issue , rather than a privacy issue . 
  so we 've established that : * 1 ) your govt does not respect your free speech * 2 ) your govt does not respect your privacy but you think that they wo n't use your private data against you ? 
  are n't you an optimist . 
  what if you write a tweet like say `` i asked a muslim in croydon to explain the terrorist attacks '' ? 
  should you get arrested for that ? 
   they 're only looking for terrorists and serious criminals , they 're not spying on everyday people . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/arrests-for-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-in-london-a7064246.html be careful what you say on reddit . 
  i wo n't want you to get arrested , 
  i have no idea why you 're getting downvoted man . 
  uk has a history of arresting people for their tweets or fb posts .

   oh no the government is compiling all of the pepe memes i use for when the illegal pepe act of 2018 is brought into effect so that they can arrest me straight away with all of the evidence they 've gathered on reddit . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/arrests-for-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-in-london-a7064246.html  ) oh man . 
  i did n't know you had deserts in uk . 
   they care about the ones planning mass murder that 's why they got ta read every email ...  ) oh man ... to be young again . 
   it 's the national health service , not the international health service . 
  well do n't they still have rights ? 
  confidential info should remain confidential regardless of the status of the person . 
  an illegal immigrant has the right to confidential legal counsel , why should that be different for medical data ? 
  but you told me that you 'll do better in all stats . 
  i feel lied to . 
   okay , let 's do top 20 eu vs uk : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nobel_laureates_by_university_affiliation * eu : 5 * uk : 3 to cut the crap short , academia is all about connections , building networks in order to exchange ideas . 
  that 's the most important aspect . 
  the anglo world can share to the level of 450 million . 
  french can share only about 80 million , germans about 90 million . 
  i guess we 'll have to send m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res to uk . 
   we should not be finding the worlds healthcare . 
  if you do n't want to look for good healthcare , at least go look for a good spellchecker . 
  getting 500k in 8 years for no work ? 
  that 's extremely convenient yes . 
   if they chose any other ranking type fields medals . 
   or how about we do it the other way round . 
  fields medals by institute of graduation so we can test teaching too . 
  i 'll also wait , 
  thatcher famous for her no no no . 
  european unity famous for [ this ] ( http://www.lamontagne.fr/photosrc/w1ztj1fdutgibhvogwyshgynqduvgfdfvv9fwkm-/francois-mitterrand-et-helmut-kohl-le-22-septembre-1984-a-do_2653188.jpeg ) . 
  i know which one i 'd pick . 
  they have the best arguments :  mr malloch added that any attempt by the eu to block britain beginning negotiations with the us would be `` absurd '' and like a husband `` trying to stop his wife having an affair '' . 
  but you lost the karma : o, 
  they actually do n't !, 
   care to address my point ? 
  if not , i 'm done here . 
  i 'll simplify my comments here . 
  european defense army will have to be the original 6 + spain . 
  this will create a core group that is independent from us influence and can act independently from whatever the wishes of the current president are . 
  this needs to be done in order to deal with the unique defense needs of europe . 
  all the other countries are not really relevant here , since they can not either : offer any amount of support that is actually noteworthy , do not exactly have a mic so they can not contribute in terms of r&d , or are too susceptible to us soft power . 
  see , it 's easy . 
   if anyone is not a big power can join as vassals . 
  welcome to the eu/nato any type of organisation really . 
   well that is , like , your opinion , man no . 
  it 's fact . 
  sweden and ireland would not joing a military union . 
   would freedom of movement also apply to the future harkis and pied noirs ? 
  does it apply to people who obtained asylum ? 
  yes . 
   why on earth would would this have to be a single thing with a binary decision ? 
  they can collaborate but then again we can collaborate with a ton of people . 
   sweden you do realise that they 're not even in nato , right ? 
  why would they join a military alliance when they 're very happy where they are . 
   f portugal , the czech republic , greece , belgium , netherlands , hungary and austria have a cumulated contribution to the eu army that is larger than france 's , okay . 
  they way it looks now with defense budgets that does n't seem to be that case http://www.globalfirepower.com/defense-spending-budget.asp  the eu is built on dialog , a european defense army would not be based on any eu framework . 
  it would n't make any sense to do that . 
  that 's why consensus does n't work here anymore and the amount of power you have matters . 
  case in point : nato goes wherever the us wants it to go . 
  okay . 
  so that 's your plan on projecting power . 
  a few dummies with suicide vests . 
  that 's a great example . 
  scales really well . 
   even isis as you may have noticed . 
  so the portuguese plan is to strap on some suicide vests and blow yourself up ? 
  yup . 
   given that french and france are irrelevant . 
  are they making the pasteis salty these days ? 
  cuz they seem so delish . 
  what do they put in ? 
  tears of portuguese ? 
   so , you believe that those with little \\ no power should have no voice . 
  i am confused . 
  what word as a portuguese do you want in the matter on eu defense ? 
  if it were spain sure , that 's a big country with many capabilities . 
  but portugal ? 
  i 'm not trying to be obtuse or stand-offish . 
  i am genuinly asking . 
  in what shape or form could or should portugal comment on military matters when its military is so small ? 
  the army is n't about consensus . 
   f you are not hot for the principle of consensus - fair enough . 
  a european defense army would not be attached to the eu . 
  we already made mistakes by growing past our means with the eu meaning old members decided to leave . 
  a few core countries like the first 6 + spain would be plently enough . 
   but then you 'll have to explain to me why the ees should not heavily prioritize territorial integrity . 
  ee can do whatever it wants with their army . 
  but i 'm guessing they 'll rather be in the european defence program than outside it ... with you know ... trump and all that . 
  chile got attacked by al qaeda ? 
  damn boy . 
  you sound salty as fuck .
