  of course . 
  we would n't be able to trial our french djihadists . 
  they committed their crimes outside of france ... 
  and that 's fine . 
  we do what we can . 
  we wo n't start a war for this . 
  and it sends a message . 
   it 's more the absurdity of the law that i 'm challenging . 
  not at all . 
  we have the same law in france . 
  i am all for justice and letting it do its business unencumbered . 
  dude . 
  the estonian was talking about ** western values ** . 
  that 's the context . 
  a country like uruguay that has gay marriage and legal marijuana has a much much better understanding of western values than poland , romania , greece , russia . 
  of course ee does better economically . 
  czech republic has for a neighbour the 3rd largest economy in the world with the 3rd highest number of nobel prizes per capita . 
  germany is one of the most innovative countries out there . 
  coupled with france , uk and some other , ee benefits immensely . 
  heck skoda is owned by vw one of the largest car manufacturers in the world and benefits hugely from their r&d , capabilities to open foreign markets etc. 
  without germany you would n't be anywhere close to where you are now ( how many science and med nobel 's did czech republic win ? 
  how about poland ? ) . 
  of course you 're doing better from an economic pov . 
  if we 'd put you in sa , yeah you 'd decrease quickly to your 1990 levels . 
  so the czech republic is eastern europe . 
  glad we settled that . 
  this is a discussion about western values . 
  we 're comparing a country that has allowed gay marriage since 2013 ( uruguay ) with a country that added in its constitution that marriage is between a man and a woman ( poland ) and we 're saying that the latter has a much finer respect of western values than the former . 
  sorry but uruguay gets it , poland or romania do n't . 
  and let 's not open the racism discussion ... how gypsies are treated in ee vs how black people are in south american . 
  es delicioso . 
  hey do n't forget dismantling the iranian deal ... so a war with iran in 2 years . 
  because iraq went so well . 
  atencion , ay demasiodo idiomas et debe hacer gaffe quand tu changes . 
   op can you drop some more info ? 
  [ touch here ] ( https://www.pharmabraille.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/braille-alphabet-and-braille-numbers.png ) if you wan na know more . 
  do n't be shy , 
  i can not see any problems . 
   for the most part the dreams of a young boy or girl in chile are indistinguishable from those of a child in canada . 
  beautiful :') . ^ ^ god ^ ^ you ^ ^ sound ^ ^ like ^ ^ a ^ ^ wuss . 
  but in all seriousness i fully agree with your analysis . 
  i could talk some more about how the various waves of colonialisms and immigrants created some sort of european society ( like you said very well ) how the chicago boys created a mini us in chile etc etc. 
  i work with some chileans , have some friends from there . 
  and in terms of values , ideals for their life , hopes and wishes for their kids , how they spend their family evenings , you could have told me i 'm in spain and i 'd not be surprised ( except they speak a weird spanish ) . 
  of course there are differences , the mapuche etc. 
  but i mean c'mon . 
  thanks for taking the time to talk in detail about these things . 
   it is a commercial construct . 
  no it 's not . 
  if you offer people opportunities , they 'll take it . 
   weeding out crime is n't . 
  you assume that sending people to jail is an easy process , always fair and always obvious , always consistent . 
  it 's not . 
   that 'll work for minor offenses . 
  also for people who present little to no danger to society . 
   how about building new ones , with decent standards ? 
  does n't really work , just like building more roads does n't reduce traffic , building [ more prisons ] ( https://blogs.mediapart.fr/sylvain-lhuissier/blog/100816/lutte-contre-la-surpopulation-carcerale-la-fausse-bonne-idee-du-gouvernement ) does n't reduce [ prison population . ] ( https://books.google.fr/books?id=7rvpg3f19cyc&amp;pg=pa37&amp;lpg=pa37&amp;dq=induced+demand+for+prisons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ail22guhyy&amp;sig=a2bnbksb7y8-m0egbehtx-smacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiqxervrnnrahwjcrqkhd2lbicq6aeinjad#v=onepage&amp;q=induced%20demand%20for%20prisons&amp;f=false ) . 
  judges will be more enclined to send people to jail . 
  welcome to the world of [ induced demand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/induced_demand ) . 
   converting old military garrisons into detention centers , like someone from the opposition proposed ? 
  how about letting people serve their sentence at home , electronic bracelets etc. 
   you know from where manel valls is from , right ? 
  goddamit you 're right . 
  the guy has a screw loose , he ca n't keep his temper : o we 'll send in the breton nationalists to [ control him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mcca7owom&amp;t=47s ), 
  oh boy , i have the impression you wan na invade france . 
  luckly the train 's slow . 
   we 'll invite people from perpiny\u00e0 man all 3 catalans ? 
  so it 's gon na be wild : o, 
   these countries are usually with powerful and corrupt central governments and civil liberties are often ignored . 
  i 'd advice you to go visit some . 
  uruguay is more advanced than any eastern european country . 
  chile is quite a stable country and argentina used to do quite well and they will . 
  claiming that their people do n't value these `` western values '' is absolutely ridiculous . 
  get off your high horse , estonian . 
   keep going , afd , maybe your result in september becomes single-digit as more people wake up to what you really are . 
  please staaahp . 
  that 's what will make them elected and become the new chancellors of the universe . 
   the fact that in this case it 's for foreigners and in a foreign country [ yeah !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statue_of_liberty ), 
  hey . 
  if you get a nice party and some pop-corn moments , all 's good . 
   outside the western world these ideals and morals have no value . 
  yeah south american countries and eastern europe could n't give a shit for those . 
   here in catalonia our referendum is scheduled for 2017 i think we 're talking about real refs here . 
   i 'm wondering if the people , who accuse le pen of being a pawn of moscow claim the same thing about fillon now too . 
  during the french debates he constantly got accused of being putin friendly ... 
   macron - charismatic upstart whose platform most closely aligns with most redditors ' views . 
  sanders sanders like macron  ) ) . 
  macron an upstart ... man thanks for the laugh . 
   this guy is not enough conservative to be compared to fillon . 
  http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/12/13/john-kasich-acts-on-abortion-bills.html fillon has been a classical french right winger concerning abortion ... meaning a center politician in the us . 
  kasich is in favor of the death penatly http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/john_kasich_crime.htm fillon voted to end it . 
  http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/peinedemort/scrutins.asp you clearly know extremely little on french politics . 
   if only the ecb had n't taken away that power from us with the euro we could have got over 2008 much faster as well * sigh * . 
  i 'm still hopeful in 2 years maybe ? 
   a person putting the good of the country before the ruling party . 
  he 's from the opposition of the ruling party . 
  think jospin/chirac . 
   and why minsk 1 was n't implemented ? 
  russia had n't finished conquering .
