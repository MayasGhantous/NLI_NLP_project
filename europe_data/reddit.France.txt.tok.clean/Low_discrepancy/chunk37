  yes yes . 
  holocaust , you have policitians from france , hungary , romania etc saying they 're annoying and start petty crimes . 
  they 're also so poor they live in literal shacks with plastic as a roof . 
  so * poor ? 
  check * descriminated ? 
  check * terrorism ? 
  not check . 
  ** i ca n't think of one gypsy terrorist attack ** . 
  wtf man ? 
  can it be that poverty does n't explain everything ? 
  yes they can .

  cayenne maybe . 
  we had good prisons back then . 
  great prisons . 
  some would say the finest prisons . 
   not all of the nazis . 
  the ideologues , yes . 
  they either stayed in europe and were still given positions of power . 
  the military arms were coopted by the cia in operation gladio . 
  the more extreme ones were given rat lines to south america . 
  they were now also given important positions eichmann was some sort of factory supervisor when he was kidnapped . 
  others participated in armed operations against south american commies ( operation bloodstone ) . 
  klaus barbie , the lyon butcher participated in catching che guevara . 
  the important scientific figures were coopted by the us ( operation paperclip got ta catch 'em all them nazi scientists ) and its ussr counterpart . 
  we can see that those who were nazis for comfort got comfortable positions , those who were nazis for scientific process/money ( von braun admits it ) still were after , and those who were nazis to kill , well they still were . 
  what about the ** islamists ** ? 
  they 'll be left to roam in their disenfranchised communisities . 
  poor , uneducated people + destructive ideology = ? 
  idiots will look up to them . 
  and they will continue the islamist propaganda because unlike the nazis that got validation from their new masters , these terrorists will remain again poor and ignored by society since they have no valuable skills , except their capacity to spew shit . 
  we now have a retarded ump senator shitting on the belgian police . 
  sigh . 
  sorry man . 
  god these people should shut the fuck up . 
  it 's pathetic . 
   france : ` hey guys , anyone want an islamic terrorist ? ', 
   entire world : crickets eh . 
  70 yo islamist wo n't be much of a threat . 
  offer 1 million for each held . 
  we 'll find someone willing . 
  if not , we have some nice islands in the south atlantic . 
  we have clipperton island . 
  where there is a will , there is a way :p and who would n't watch survivor : old terrorists edition ? 
   to be fair , a lot of nazi and/or soviet war-criminals after the nazis got nice comfortable lives too . 
  so ended in high echelons of power . 
  these terrorists will come back and will spew their hatred and twisted views in their disenfranchised community . 
  i talked about this so so so much . 
  i talked about layered security , i talked about the fact that one small breach in one single point in a large border can bring so many sweet benefits ( access to the whole of europe ) but i was told it 'll cost too much , that people do n't want to wait 1 hour to pass the border , that bad guys will always go through so why make it harder ? 
   as for me , the blame gaming seemed like a giant waste of time . 
  exactly . 
  it 's high time it ends . 
  we 're all in this together . 
  th\u00e9 blaming game ** must ** stop . 
  except firing those people in the intel services that absolutely are incompetent . 
  we also ** must stop ** the `` well all the problems are in belgium/france/tierra del fuego/insert the country you hate '' we need changes in our policies . 
  http://mobile.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/03/01/ce-que-savait-la-police-belge-sur-les-freres-abdeslam_4874375_3214.html listen some people ** inside ** your police saying that they were amateurs . 
  listen them saying they simply did n't have the means . 
  enough . 
  we erase everything . 
  it wo n't bring back the dead but now that there are explosions in the airport and in the subway , maybe ** both ** countries should do something . 
  let 's ** re-organise ** the intel services . 
  let 's fire those incompetent , and let 's fund them correctly . 
   i 'd rather we just locked up anyone who tried to join isis . 
  you jail them for 40 years then send them to any foreign country that accepts their old asses . 
  it 's simply . 
  i do not want to share the same citizenship with a mass murderer . 
  uk is great at this : they even create stateless people . 
  bravo uk . 
  fuck sharing your country with people that wan na destroy . 
   because , at the earliest opportunity , people shifted blame to belgium . 
  dude hearing your pm that criminality and banlieues are in france . 
  that there is no marseille in belgium . 
  ** fuck that ** . 
  when i pointed out that belgian intel services were just as shit during the 13th of nov attack , just as much as the french intel services , i was kindly told to shut it up and mind my own business . 
  the terries were french it was the fault of just france . 
   http://mobile.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/article/2016/03/19/a-molenbeek-qui-a-vu-quoi-qui-a-entendu-quelque-chose_4886058_4809495.html look at the your molenbeek citizens saying : `` the banlieues are not here , they 're in france '' . 
  your prime minister said the same thing . 
  ( also try to ignore those citizens that say the terrorists did n't kill anyone , it was the sionists and the secret services ) . 
  we all live in our little bubble without realising our action or more precisely inaction affects others and also hits back . 
  our blinding patriotism kills innocent people . 
  france , belgium , sweden , denmark send per capita the highest number of terrorists in syria . 
  it 's a wake up call because those people ** will ** come back once the war is over . 
  these people killed , decapitated , tortured , raped over there . 
  what will they do when they come back ? 
  get a little house with a nice small garden and tend to it ? 
  pick up cooking and pottery classes ? 
   no it is not . 
  it is about 20 % of economy if you include veterans pensions . 
  you ca n't really cut off the pensioners can you ? 
  we 're good at technology : check out the exocet , 
  i agree . 
  and with expulsions if you do not make the target . 
  heck maybe even increase the target to 3 % . 
  us medicare spending is the same as the army spending . 
  but now you have to add medicaid , teachers , policemen , firemen , etc etc etc. 
  military budget is 4.5 % . 
  sure they can drop it to 2 % . 
  but it 's not like a miracle will happen . 
  their healthcare system is the most costly in the world , yet the results are not up to par .
