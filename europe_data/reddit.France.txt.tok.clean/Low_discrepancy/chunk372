  china 's people are used to suffering . 
  are americans used to ? 
   their economy is wobbling just on the threat of trump 's policies . 
  myes . 
  it 's not like china has all the manufacturing the us needs , detains 7 % of us debt etc. 
  he wo n't do shit . 
  it 's because we 're belgium + + . 
  we at least it 's obvious you 're no german . 
  i 'll get occupied by the italians . 
  crazy hijinks will ensue . 
   we 're justified in condemning islam at every step because of isis and boko haram . 
  are our muslims voting for isis candidates in europe ? 
  or are you saying some people in fn and afd are just like isis ( here we can agree ) ? 
  your little mme le pen on roids frauke petry said police should use firearms to stop border crossings . 
  that 's not inherently wrong ? 
  orly ? 
  how many deserts does germany have ? 
   or is it globalism which is in its death throws ? 
  yeah china is cowering in fear now that trump got elected . 
  i thought the eu was merkelistan caliphate . 
   intellectually idiotic that there are laws against those who `` deny '' something supposed to be an objective fact . 
  here ya go buddy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-semite_and_jew, 
   hes comparing something that is not inherently wrong here 's a map of fn candidates that had homophobic , racist , xenophobic statements http://www.liberation.fr/apps/2015/03/carto-fn/ but that 's freedom of expression and that 's not inherently bad amirite ? 
   yeah , everyone right of center uhm . 
  no gwb and the old republicans are right of center . 
  ump , cdu and the torries are right of center . 
  fn , the north league , wilders are all extreme right . 
  http://www.liberation.fr/apps/2015/03/carto-fn/ there are people in fn calling on retarded restrictions on muslims , le pen father said that the gas chambers are simply a detail of history , invited a jewish reporter for a few oven-baked goodies ... 
  it 's stupid to claim they 're just a few confused children . 
   with that kind of arguments you will only push more people to the right side of the spectrum . 
  breaking news : popes gets le pen elected !, 
   they most certainly want to eradicate certain demographics do you want yurop to become a muslim infested , islamo-fascist caliphate ? 
   usually in these sort of cases , it 'll turn out to be ' 5 burglaries and losing their id card ' well losing your id should n't be illegal therefor these people should n't be detained under immigration laws . 
   100 % correct laws i 'm happy we agree   any law anywhere in the world in france we respect french law , 
   im supporting peoples ( yes , both parents ) right to abort a baby . 
  so if the man does n't want a baby but the woman does , he can force the woman to ? 
  did i read this right ? 
   hahaha . 
  so funny . 
  almost like dancing on jewish graves : / hahahaha . 
  so funny . 
  almost like masturbation . 
  like if a woman drives a car in saudi arabia then returns to france ? 
  1 ) why would net figures matter ? 
  if more british leave does that mean there are fewer eu citizens in britains immigration detention centers ? 
  that makes sense to you ? 
  2 ) the yearly migration does not answer the question ** how many migrants are in uk now ? ** . 
  basically you claim that someone that arrived in 2015 can not be in a british immigration detention center . 
  3 ) ~ ~ where are you getting your numbers from ? ~ ~ got it . 
  so , even by assuming that only immigrants from this year will find themselves in a detention center ( a ridiculous claim but i 'll play ball ) . 
  the increase is of order 3 while the people in detention centers are 5 times as many , it 's kinda ridiculous to claim it 's not a policy issue . 
  they could have pressed charges in 77 . 
  in reality the judge seemed to run his own shitshow and everybody got pissed even the victim and the da . 
  am not even american . 
  but this might explain why the americans never bothered . 
  http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/eu-migration-to-and-from-the-uk/#kp1 number of eu born people in uk : * 2008 : 2.1 million * 2016 : 3.5 million . 
  what kind of revolutionary maths are you doing ? 
  they thought children of men was a documentary ? 
   perhaps the french justice system should not claim jurisdiction to block the american justice system over crimes committed on american soil . 
  he 's on french soil currently  the man raped a child in the united states . 
  the americans should have pressed charges to the french  . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_polanski_sexual_abuse_case#conviction_and_flight he could have been charged even following cali law . 
  in fact even in the us he was supposed to be sent to a psychiatric unit for 90 days , then deported forever , that was the plea brgain . 
  but the judge , changed his mind and wanted to convict him for a long time ... so he left . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/roman-polanski-the-truth-about-his-notorious-sex-crime-949106.html  in the documentary , geimer says of rittenband , `` he did n't care what happened to me , and he did n't care what happened to polanski . 
  he was orchestrating some little show ' that i did n't want to be in . '', 
  even gunson comments -- and this is the prosecutor , mark you -- `` i 'm not surprised that [ polanski ] left under those circumstances . '', 
  geimer was the victim , reittenband the judge and gunson the da . 
  why the americans never pressed charges in france confuses me though . 
   that does n't seem to be an accurate representation of what the page says us claims jurisdiction over the dollar even if the crime is happening outside of the us . 
  http://cblr.columbia.edu/archives/10853  the united states not only may order the freeze of u.s. dollar transfers but also the seizure of dollar accounts that are maintained by foreign banks outside the united states . 
  furthermore , french banks have been fined by the us for dealing with sudan , iran or cuba . 
  while i do n't know how it was for sudan or iran , for cuba we had no blockade . 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/r-bruised-and-grumbling-foreign-banks-bend-to-us-rules-2014-13?ir=t so we bow to the economic might of the us . 
   if the french citizen committed the crime in the us ? 
  yes . 
  no , france demands that you bow to the french justice system on french soil . 
  that expensive army of ours should count for something . 
  heck , you claim so much power that you 're ready to invade [ netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_service-members'_protection_act ) if an american citizen will face the international criminal court . 
  no charges were brought to him to the french authorities . 
  ask the americans why they never did that . 
   laws can be changed . 
  true . 
  well at the next assembl\u00e9e nationale \u00e9lections this june , you can vote for the d\u00e9put\u00e9 that promises to change this law . 
  are there any in your circonscription ? 
  laws are made to be applied to everyone , even for child molesters . 
   especially since he 's a citizen of poland too . 
  are you sure you 're french ? 
  because you should know that we treat people with double citizenship the same . 
  yeah but in france we respect the law . 
  the americans should have pressed charges against polanski in france . 
  they decided not to , oddly . 
   you can get away with murder ( or rape ) if you are french and commit it abroad i think you completely misunderstand the law in general . 
  the jurisdiction of a country does not apply only to that country . 
  usually countries extend their jurisdiction to every citizen . 
  if a french citizen commits a crime abroad , then the french justice system claims jurisdiction . 
  if the person returns to france , you have to press charges in france and let the french justice system carry it 's judgement and punishment . 
  the french justice system considers that is has supreme power on the french soil and no others have the right to meddle in it . 
  you know how the us can claim jurisdiction over any crime that involves even us property , like the dollar ? 
  http://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/how-us-laws-can-apply see how jurisdiction is a complicated matter ?
