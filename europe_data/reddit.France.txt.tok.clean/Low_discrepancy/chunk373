  well then if a crime involves a french person , the french claim jurisdiction . 
  many times they can not apply it , but in certain cases they can , for example if a french person committed a crime abroad . 
  if that happens , and the perp returned to france , what you are supposed to do is press charges to the french . 
  if you americans convict a french citizen into the electric chair but in france we do n't have the death penalty , why should we send you our citizens to be killed ? 
   by the way emiting lasers you can not seriously be concerned about interfering optically independent lasers . 
   ll cars emiting ultrasounds , would be on itself an interesting problem because self driving cars would have the potential to interfere with other selfdriving cars . 
  that again is a concern that has been already fixed since about the 1940s by using random frequency hopping . 
   , except self driving cars are awesome and have no problems i did not say that . 
  but you claim that some stuff are problematic when in reality they are not . 
   and the analysis of that guy killed in a crash with a trailer the guy was killed while driving a tesla using mobileye . 
  mobileye is only a range of tools and it does n't really come close to the type of complexity that companies like google are offering . 
   google ( and not only them ) is full of hype about their own projects the fact that you conflate mobileye 's level 3 and google level 4 of car autonomy speaks volumes about how much you bothered with the topic . 
   he world is still waiting for google glass . 
  or amazon drone deliveries yeah and google circles failed . 
  clearly that is a bad sign for autonomous cars ... 
   what france should do is let him sit on that panel , and then arrest and extradite him to us . 
  what we do is read french law . 
  france ( and a great deal of many countries ) do not extradite their own citizens . 
  ( minor exception : we do to the eu ) . 
   wont extradite a child rapist for whatever reason . 
  serbia would n't be able to extradite him either if he were a serbia citizen . 
  https://www.loc.gov/law/help/extradition-of-citizens/chart.php we only extradite french citizens to eu countries . 
   bad lighting https://www.national.co.uk/tech-powers-google-car/ humans are not capable of emitting lasers out of our eyes , nor do we have radar , or ultrasound . 
  google car has all of this and much more . 
  lasers do n't give a shit about bad lighting . 
  they are light . 
   black ice , aquaplaning . 
  so you turn traction control off because fuck it !, 
  a computer does n't know how to drive better than you do . 
   ai would have a really difficult time trying to reach that decision . 
  do you work in such a field to be able to claim this ? 
  ... that name sounds vaguely familiar . 
  but i ca n't seem to remember why ... guys can you help me out ? 
  what did he do , this farange guy ? 
  there 's no separation between religion and politics in france, 
  what a sham of a subreddit !, 
  they claim to make maths jokes yet the [ second highest thread of all time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpectedfactorial/comments/49tvjf/expensive_tickets_theyre_1010103392866570225016/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=unexpectedfactorial ) shows they 've never heard of multifactorials . 
   eastern european countries will start to grow again at some point , have you seen birthrates by european countries man ? 
  http://www.ouest-france.fr/monde/etats-unis/donald-trump/sondage-75-des-francais-ont-une-mauvaise-opinion-de-donald-trump-4606996 75 % of french have a bad opinion of trump . 
  thank god !, 
  i 've always voted for the winner . 
   i have a strange feeling this was the conclusion you were gunning for all along . 
  myes . 
  everybody 's gunning for romania 's finest institutions . 
  we 're putinbots after all . 
  up until now i was quite admirative of romania 's anti-corruption efforts . 
  but your source shows how it 's just a political institution like all others . 
  talking about a law and giving `` the example '' of the fire . 
  why is a anti-corruption organisation concerned about the fact that a doctor forgot to turn on the barometric chambers at a hospital ? 
   do n't want all 60 yo fat cat corrupt politicians or business men having half of their sentence pardoned . 
  yeah . 
  you got ta act tough on crime , amirite ? 
  better think about the criminals abroad buddy . 
   none of them of any proven urgency romania got convicted by the european court of human rights and it also had laws shown as anti-constitutional . 
  yeah no urgency ... no wonder we have to solve your gypsy problem for you by sending them back home . 
  schengen seems to be the only urgency concerning romania . 
   this is completely false . 
  ugh you are forcing me to repeat myself . 
   of the decree was to simply pardon some 60 + yo offenders , which is blatantly false that is the ** second ** decree . 
  that 's the only thing it states . 
    i wrote decriminalize , in english , which in romanian means a `` decriminaliza = a scoate de sub incidenta legii penale '' . 
  that is the ** first ** decree . 
  that is * different * from the other one i just mentioned . 
  and you are right . 
  acts of abuse where the damage is under 200k are removed . 
  this is art 297 acts of corruption where you gain any amount are still the same , though . 
  so they 're a different law . 
  art 301 art 297 was declared ** unconstitutional ** by the constitutional court because it 's too vague , it talks about damage ( if i forget to wake you up and you lose your train and then your job , i caused you damages of x euros but there was no corruption for example ... so just because i caused damage , does n't mean i gained something ... if i do , it 's also a different law -  301 ) . 
  also the constitutional court said that ** any ** action or inaction can fall under this law because a minimum for damage was not established . 
  are you an state employee and you blinked ? 
  ok you cause me a damage of 0 euros , so you should go to court . 
  so yeah man , you 're protesting the constitutional court for making sense . 
   the decree proposed to decriminalize any fraud under 50k let us read everything from the hourse 's mouth http://www.just.ro/referitor-la-aparitia-in-spatiul-public-a-unor-luari-de-pozitie-cu-privire-la-procesul-de-elaborare-a-unor-acte-normative-ministerul-justitiei-face-urmatoarele-precizari/ * 1 ) the pardon decree applies for people over 60 , pregnant women , those not condemned of violent acts or those not condemned for acts of corruption . 
  in a country with 150 % occupation of prisons ... you people are idiots . 
  * 2 ) is a law proposition to change the penal code . 
  let 's take a reading * * art 297 ) if through action or inaction , you commit a faulty act , then you will go to jail 2-7 years . 
  * * art 298 ) if through action or inaction , you commit a faulty act through neglijence , then you will go to jail . 
  * * art 301 ) if you commit or not commit an action and you ( or your family up to the second degree ) gain advantages from that , you will go to jail . 
  http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-penal/art-297 on june 2016 , the constitutional court decides that article 297 is ** anti constitutional ** https://www.juridice.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/decizia_405.pdf because the phrase `` faulty act '' sounds too vague and you might do it by mistake , because it sounds too random there is no cutoff , because it sounds too subjective , because the law should be predictable and that law is n't . 
  ** emphasis from the contitutional court of you mother fucking country . 
  ** you read it right ** . 
  your mother fucking constitutional court told you that ** any active human being ** can be convicted of corruption because any act can be concieved as committing harm if you define harm as anything about 0 lei . 
  your own constitutional court called you people a bunch of idiots , and that you should put a starting limit for the damage . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : romanians are protesting that 60 + yos and pregnant women will be released from jails where you reach 200 % occupancy . 
  also romanians are protesting the constitutional court . 
  romania has laws now where if you do ** 0 damage ** to someone and are living , you can go to jail . 
  in that case i appologise . 
  but nope : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/21/theresa-may-to-offer-business-an-olive-branch-with-hint-of-futur/ may wants to offer the lowest tax of the 20 largest economies out of the gate , without any threat from the eu . 
  simply to please business . 
  they promised 15 % before http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36699642 at 15 % i am all in favor for setting up trade tariffs for uk . 
  my comment is about you inventing adversity where there is none . 
   if the eu looks to harshly punish britain nope . 
  eu never expressed the desire to punish uk . 
   fords sell very well over here and they come from across the atlantic . 
  * sigh * no dude , they are n't https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_motor_company#europe, 
   holy fuck , thats a bad thing , that 's because / u/pulicafranaru did n't bother presenting the whole story : romania has a degree of occupation of prisons of 143 % . 
  in some areas it 's 200 % ( yeah ) . 
  https://www.romanialibera.ro/politica/institutii/anp--peste-3-700-de-detinuti-ar-putea-beneficia-de-gratiere-438664 it 's fucking inhumane . 
  and they already were talking last year about freeing some people that had light sentences . 
  but apparently it did n't pass through .
