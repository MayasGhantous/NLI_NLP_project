  or you can believe the narrative that they wan na release all crooks ... whichever frightens you the most . . 
  did you bother reading what he said ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/18/not-punish-britain-shed-illusions-eu-fair-deal  but it is an illusion to suggest that the uk will be permitted to leave the eu but then be free to opt back into the best parts of the european project , for instance by ** asking for zero tariffs from the single market without accepting the obligations ** that come with it . 
  i hope that british people will see from the perspective of an eu taxpayer how unreasonable this would be . 
  here ya go buddy . 
  proof 's in the puddin ' . 
  uk can not have fta without ** obligations ** . 
   i think in the context if the eu looks to punish the uk for leaving by imposing very harsh tarifs say what now ? 
  i know it 's an american trait to invent hostility and opposition ( iraq wmds amirite ? ), 
  where there is none , but i mean c'mon !, 
   undermines any kind of effort to improve any give society . 
  seems that it was for anyone that committed a fraud under 50k . 
  sure that 's maybe a big amount for an average person , but it is in no way a significant amount and it 's not what caused romania 's issues . 
  bechtel and other massive contracts were not a 50k problem . 
  probably for very small amouts , judges do n't even give jail time . 
  the fact that those people do n't get to serve jail does not mean that their criminal record is clean , does not mean that they should not be fired from their job , never to be hired again . 
  i fail to see the benefits of sending to jail someone that commits small time fraud . 
  but hey , you got ta be tough on crime amirite ? 
  he wants to remove sanctions for russia , start an eu-russia economic partnership , mps close to him visited assad and are in favour of him continuing to govern syria after that war is done . 
   what obligations does canada have for example ? 
  dude i know that uk wants to follow canada 's immigration model ... but you 're not exactly ... canada . 
  your economic profile is n't the same and in major issues between canada : agriculture and food , things are still controlled but with higher quotas . 
  canada did n't threaten us to become a tax haven , canada is an ocean away meaning it 's not exactly feasible to transport a lot of goods like automobiles . 
  if uk has a 0 corporate tax policy and tons of fiscal benefits , what stops all major automobile manufacturers from setting shop in uk then exporting everything to the eu ? 
  if you 're telling me : well all countries should slash all taxes and let corporations be free , i 'll reply that my vote will go towards blocking such a ridiculous thing . 
  and heck trade with uk is ** 8 ** times larger than with canada . 
   i agree that it is not completely clear to me what he means by `` obligations '' . 
  well verfs talked about security , uk and eu citizens , about not having a dumping nations at our borders , northern ireland ... that should give you some hints . 
   but the uk would not be a member of the single market , so why would it comply with the obligations that come with it ? 
  if slashing taxes is more desirable than an fta ... well ... 
   see you trolls are n't even trying anymore . 
  i was called a traitor all of a sudden by / u/steppewolfro without me saying anything . 
  of course i 'll bite back . 
  pray i do n't bite more in may , 
   but she wants none of the obligations . 
  heck it 's sufficient to actually read what [ verfs ' saying ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/18/not-punish-britain-shed-illusions-eu-fair-deal ) . 
  his obligations seem very well stated unlike what / u/lejeune _ dirichelet claims . 
  security , rights for eu citizens in uk and brits that live here , calm down with the threat of tax dumping , finding a solution to northern ireland . 
   verhofstat 's position seems oh god , i feel like in hs analysing a piece of litterature . 
  what did the author mean to say . 
  this is the interview : https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/18/not-punish-britain-shed-illusions-eu-fair-deal  but it is an illusion to suggest that the uk will be permitted to leave the eu but then be free to opt back into the best parts of the european project , for instance by asking for zero tariffs from the single market without accepting the obligations that come with it . 
  i hope that british people will see from the perspective of an eu taxpayer how unreasonable this would be . 
  the guy is talking about ** obligations ** . 
  after this the next paragraph is about security collaboration , about eu and british citizens and then about uk threatening a tax dumping scheme . 
  it is obvious for me that if uk wants a free trade deal , there ** are obligations ** . 
  one of them is to not become a tax haven . 
  if uk chooses that path , as a eu and french citizen i will vote for anyone willing to implement trade tariffs . 
  i do not see where it is written that verfs refuses the concept of free trade agreements . 
  can you enlighten me ? 
   he is pro russian then what is le pen then ? 
  she 's pro-sucking up putin . 
  there 's a degree there . 
   you 're giving different answers from my questions . 
  the east west divide was from another convo and assumed it 's this one . 
  concerning your comment , you talked about lithuania and how bad russian crimes were there . 
  okay . 
  i wo n't deny it since i do n't know your case . 
  but they 're irrelevant here . 
  soviet crimes during the occupation were not at all significant . 
  no katyn type of events . 
  in moldova they were more significant , but in the same order of magnitude as the romanian crimes against the jewish . 
  the communist oppression in romania was lead in its majority by romanians and there was little influence from the soviets . 
  so your experience it not relevant in this topic . 
  yours is much better for a leaver . 
  i have bel-out for a remainer . 
  you 're talking about lithuania in a convo about romania . 
  you realise how pointless it is ? 
  at least france participated actively in romania 's history . 
  there 's no connection between lithuania and romania . 
   bin laden claiming to promote love , peace and understanding . 
  more like trump saying he wants peace ... by conceding crimea to russia , declaring nato obsolete . 
  i mean , i guess chamberlain also wanted peace . 
   verhofstadt did a pretty big disservice to the eu here in a negociation you start with a very favourable option for you and converge towards the middle . 
  uk threatened to slash corporate tax . 
  eu 's saying fine , well put tarrifs . 
  free trade is fine in an equal world . 
  in a very unequal world with very unequal standards , free trade becomes bothersome . 
  did n't the uk threaten to severely slash corporate tax ? 
  uk having very low corporate tax and 0 trade taxes seems like a very bad idea . 
  seems like everybody is presenting their worst offers , and slowly they 'll meet in the middle . 
   there might be job losses , but there might be jobs gained elsewhere in manufacturing with the weaker pound . 
  so you ca n't make the pound weaker without leaving the eu ? 
  darn i must have skipped that class in uni . 
  onpc . 
  give me a call when you 're contributing to the eu budget instead of taking . 
  i 'll give you call when we have to send your countrymen back home . 
  she 's not fishing for the communist vote . 
  she 's fishing for the disgruntled low level worker than can not find a job vote . 
  once upon a time , communists had that vote . 
  communists nowadays are focusing on helping immigrants . 
  my taxes are paying for your roads buddy boy . 
  now shush . 
  my comments are pointless because yours was from the beginning . 
  romania is n't lithuania . 
  there is no east west divide . 
  every country was different . 
  the fact that you 're eastern european absolutely does not make you more knowledgeable on the situation in romania . 
   us did n't annex iraq or afghanistan . 
  us did n't need to do that . 
  they just named a us friendly govt .
