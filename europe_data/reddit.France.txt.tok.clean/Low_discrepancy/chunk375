  once it becomes non-us friendly , they 'll take them down like it happened in chile , guatemala or iran . 
   if you did n't noticed , this is happening right now all over europe , even in your country . 
  yeah . 
  russian hackers are attacking news stations ( like france 24 ) and americans are reading my emails and hacking my phone . 
  [ hacked my president 's phone ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls ) and forced aother countries to spy on one of the best [ european companies ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/30/airbus-could-sue-following-allegations-germany-spied-on-them-for-the-us ) so what position did you take on the massive espionage the us is undertaking on eu citizens and eu companies ? 
   `` people commit crimes . 
  let 's legalize crimes . '', 
  in france we commute punishments that are non violent and smaller than x months . 
  prisons are overcrowded over here , so if the arguments stand ... meh . 
  and the present shows that the us invaded a country on lies of wmds , destabilised a whole region , etc. 
  what 's your point ? 
  there are about 0 ukranian refugees in romania . 
  crimea is about as relevant for romania as irak is . 
  russia showed as much desire to invade romania as the us did . 
  well irak is a bit more relevant since some 80 romanians died there for no reason whatsoever . 
   he is n't pro russian well i can see there 's one person in the world that believes that . 
  if we did the maths , we 'd find out that about as many romanians were killed by stalin in moldova as jewish and gypsies killed by romanians in moldova , bessarabia , the transdniester republic , odessa ( under romanian rule ) . 
  does that mean that israel should worry about romania invading them ? 
  stalin 's dead so is fascism in romania . 
  how about people focus on the present concerning international politics . 
   under ottoman surezainty https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suzerainty  suzerainty ( / \u02c8sju\u02d0z\u0259r\u0259nti / or / \u02c8sju\u02d0z\u0259r\u025bnti / ) is a situation in which a powerful region or people controls the foreign policy and international relations of a tributary vassal state while ** allowing the subservient nation internal autonomy . 
  ** it had no more internal autonomy since the rulers were established by the ottomans . 
   sians started a war with ottomans on more fronts and got stuck in balkans and caucasus as well so called from help from romania ... help which come . 
  https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c4%83zboiul_ruso-turc_ ( 1877 % e2 % 80 % 931878 ) you got it extremely wrong . 
  the war started on the 27th of april 1877 . 
  before that russia had lost the crimean war , but in the balkans the situation was boiling . 
  in 75-76 bulgarians start revolting against the ottomans and a serbo-turkish war started . 
  russia signs an agreement with romania to cross the military so they can declare war and fight in bulgaria . 
  at the same time the war in the caucasus started . 
  they advanced quite quickly there in april-june as [ you can see on this map ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/fi%c8%99ier:the_russo-turkish_war_in_caucasia,_1877.gif ) . 
  romania crosses the border in the south with russia and attacks some fortifications . 
  russia continues the war more to the south allowing bulgaria , serbia and montenegro to declare independence . 
  romania declares independence on may 1877 when russia was doing quite well on both fronts . 
  later it had some problems on the caucasus front . 
  i fail to understand where you get your impression that russia had started the war before . 
  russia 's fleet was destroyed following crimea so they could only attack by land . 
  that meant they needed to cross romania . 
   his conclusion is that it was much safer to be jew in romania during wwii than in the rest of europe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust#jewish no . 
  in norway , france , bulgaria , italy or russia , they had much better rates of survival . 
   moreover , if you claim that bits of history are forgotten remember holodomor . 
  how is that relevant to romanian history ? 
  we 're talking about romania here not lithuania . 
  these situations are vastly different . 
  romania was never a soviet nor part of the russian empire . 
  also :  between 1941 and 1944 , german and romanian authorities murdered or caused the deaths of between 150,000 and 250,000 romanian and ukrainian jews in transnistria . 
  at least 270,000 romanian jews were killed or died from mistreatment during the holocaust . 
   at that time the principality of moldavia was under ottoman surezainty , with a degree of autonomy . 
  the principality of moldova from 1711 to 1821 ( bessarabia was taken in 1811 btw . 
  was under phanariot rule . 
  that means that greeks from phanar istanbul were bribing the sultan in order to obtain rule of a country or another . 
  once in power , they 'd serve just their own interests , would hike taxes etc in order to gain the money they lost in the bribes and make something on top for their effort . 
  it is widely considered as the period when the romanian principalities has ** the least ** power in some 300 years of ottoman rule since they started to intervene directly in policies . 
  it was a very yoyo period . 
  some werent that bad ( abolishing serfdom ) , others were completely awful . 
   your history knowledge is kind of ridiculous . 
  between 1711 and 1945 , there were 11 russian invasion of romanian territories ( and not bessarabia ) . 
  yeah . 
  a lot of wars happened on romanian soil between russia and the ottomans . 
  big fucking surprise there . 
  they were not invasions . 
  also romania ( or principalities ) were under russian protectorate but russia pretty much retracted . 
  sure they took moldova . 
  and ? 
  do you count the romanian independence war where russia helped out by providing ** 4 times ** more troops than romania as an invasion ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_war_of_independence kinda weird how way more russians died than romanians in the romanian independence war ...  russia did n't invade because it was exhausted of war and romanian army proved itself against turks . 
  romania was quite panicked that omg russia will invade us , they even signed a treaty with russia . 
  and no invasion took place . 
  they took budjak where romanians were a minority and in exchange romania got dobruja , a far better exchange since romania gained constanta which became a massive port in 1878 . 
   you got your history facts pretty wrong and you 're using your arguments in the same manner as a sputnik trumpet . 
  many arguments right there ... suuure . 
   so stop blaming romanian exclusively for the madness of entire europe during those years . 
  like it or not , romania is the sole responsible party for the holocaust that happened on romanian soil . 
  the iasi progrom ... no germans were even around . 
  deportation of gypsies to bug ... well romanian army can be thanked for that . 
  it 's exceptionally interesting how these little nuggets of history are forgotten ( took 2011 for iasi to build its first memorial to having killed 13k jews in 2 days ) . 
  i 'm not sure what the point of your comment is ... we all committed horrible acts . 
  what a list of what acts france committed ? 
  do you think algeria wants to start a war with france because of those acts ? 
   who got to experience the actions of the red army first hand when they were `` liberated '' by it . 
  kinda like how the jews felt when the romania army was around ? 
   romanians tend to not put their hopes and trust in other countries in case of war and are generally scared shitless of anything russian . 
  yeah . 
  it 's much easier to blame the ruskies and the germans than actually make some small effort and realise that the worst crimes during ww2 and during communism , on romanian soil , were caused by romanians . 
  romania has a mini victimisation problem . 
   moldova was part of russian empire ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_moldova#part_of_the_russian_empire here you go buddy . 
   how dodon is dissapointed the russian empire dodon is insignificant to current russian interests . 
   you understand conquest , right ? 
  yeah , we live in 2017 not 1790 . 
  or do you want hungary to ask for oradea back because it was in majority hungarian when it was taken in 1918 . 
   soviet ultimatum on ceding bessarabia and northern bukovina . 
  ** exactly ** . 
  why the hell did n't the soviet union completely invade romania ? 
  do you think anyone would have cared ? 
  it was uterly defenseless . 
  because for russia , moldova is part of the influence sphere while romania proper is n't . 
   what you fail to provide is a context regarding past transgressions of russia towards romania like why do n't you mention axis transgressions ? 
  romania joined the axis even though hungary took nothern transylvania . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award  `` romania did n't fire a single bullet to protect bessarabia '' .
