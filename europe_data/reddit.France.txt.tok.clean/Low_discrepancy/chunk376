  it did n't fire many more to protect what it lost to its own allies , the hungarians . 
   honestly , your style of twisting history brings me the thought that you 're just another putin fanboy , but i will give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume you are only misinformed . 
  no , you simply live in your little bubble where russia is the big bad wolf ready to pounce on romania . 
  congratulations , but that 's not an accurate representation of historic reality . 
   moldova is russian , just like normandy is british !, 
  moldova is as romanian as corsica is italian . 
  my great grandparents were hoping for churchill not to serve their country to stalin on a silver platter and i 'm sure churchill had hoped that romania not join the axis powers ... yet here we are and it 's time to stop complaining about the past . 
  romania feeling threatened by russia is one of the most ridiculous things ever . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il_x6-gynas  because i always had one fear : that russia would suddenly assault romania in late autumn , and would annex the petroleum sources ... and we would have been not finished yet in late autumn 1940 . 
  if russia had occupied the romanian petroleum sources , germany would have been lost ... ( unintelligible one or two words , something with ` need ' ? 
  ) ... with ... with , with 60 russian divisions this thing could have been arranged ; back then we had in romania no task force yet , the romanian government has turned to us very lately ... and what we had would have been ridiculous indeed . 
  they only would have needed to occupy the petroleum sources , i could not have started a war in september or october any more with our arms , that was indeed impossible ... we also had the deployment of our troops in the east not prepared in any way , the units had to be consolidated in the west first , the armament had to be brought in order ... because , naturally , we had also have made our sacrifices during the west campaign . 
  it would have been impossible to line up before the spring of 1941 , and if now the russian , back then in the autumn of 1940 , had occupied rumania , and had annexed the petroleum sources , then we would have been ... err ... helpless in the year 1941 ... we had ... have the large german production , but the amount the air force alone is consuming , the amount our tank-divisions are consuming that is something quite monstrous . 
  it is a ... a ... a consumption surpassing all imagination . 
  and without the afflux of four to five million tons of rumanian petroleum , we would not be able to wage the war ... . 
  here 's friggin hitler saying his ** major ** fear was that russia would invade romania and occupy the oil fields meaning that they would n't have any capabilities to invade russia . 
  and he 's saying that romania was defenseless while stalin had 60 divisions ... yet stalin does n't invade . 
  they could have invaded in during the [ romanian independence war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_war_of_independence ) in 1877 but they did n't . 
  they only got a piece of land that were romanians were a minority while romania got dobruja , a vastly more important region . 
  heck look at after ww2 . 
  hungary wants freedom ... gets invaded . 
  czechoslovakia asks for freedom ... gets invaded . 
  ceausescu effectively separates from soviet block , the ** first effective ** visit by an american president in the ** whole of eastern europe ** was by nixon in '69 was in romania https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_visits_to_eastern_europe_and_northern_asia romania was the first country from the western block that recognized israel , etc etc etc. 
  and what was russia 's reacion ? 
  * shrug * romania simply can not realise that moldova = / = romania . 
  it 's the only thing they wanted because for historic reasons it was part of the russian empire . 
  but romania proper was never so they do n't give a flying rat 's ass . 
  the whole existential fear romania has about russia is so so so blown out of proportion by romanian war hawks , that it 's getting ridiculous . 
  as long as you do n't put american nukes russia wo n't give a shit about romania . 
  in my fields : mathematics ... australia does n't really matter that much ( i bet terrence tao would be considered us by now ) but russia is hugely significant ... 
  yeah i 'm sure haarp and other military institutions produce a ton of research that is easily accessible to be referenced, 
  it 's very easy . 
  she speaks [ american ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/sep/07/sarah-palin-tells-immigrants-to-the-us-to-speak-american-video ), 
   you just declared that law was abused in some anecdotal cases stop bullshiting http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-opinii-5597630-basescu-pozitii-antagonice-uniunea-europeana-privind-acordarea-cetateniei-romane-mai-multor-moldoveni.htm http://www.investigatii.md/ro/investigatii/coruptie/traficantii-de-cetatenie-te-fac-roman-cu-acte-masluite people from the national authority for citizenship have declared that moldavians just use it to move easier to the eu and get a job . 
  even basescu said that few actually want to stay . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8029849.stm the eu even had to intervene and ask for harsher conditions in obtaining the citizenship ... 
  the situation is rife with abuse . 
  and you 're wondering why romania wo n't get into schengen soon . 
  oh and once uk leaves , between you and me , who do you think will have a harder time to go there ? 
   de gaulle must be spinning in his grave . 
  no no . 
  you misunderstand . 
  her supporters and other idiots will claim that she is very much a gaullist . 
  look at her how brave she is , france under le pen will become again a bridge between the east and the west . 
  it will be a balanced policy . 
  of course they 'll forget that he condemned the invasion of czechoslavakia for example . 
   so russia can just occupy any territory , fill it with russians , and then call it their own ? 
  apparently only if russians really want it . 
   self-determination is a cardinal principle in international law . 
  respecting international agreements is a cardinal principle of international law . 
  russia did n't by invading crimea . 
   eu politicians were immune from kosovo/rep . 
  srpska-like independence poo flinging ... she 's as much an eu politician as farange is . 
   it might look like that to you , it a provision to disqualify people , not to qualify them , it is a condition to disqualify people . 
  it is up to you to prove that you are willing to become a citizen , that you are integrated in society , that you have no desire to move somewhere else . 
   i think there were some cases when people declared that afterwards a ) normally there is a x year trial period where you can retract the citizenship . 
  b ) it shows how sloppy they were ( of course , they were on purpose sloppy ) . 
  normally you have to prove you are integrated in society by having a stable job and means to live in the country , that your center of interests lies in the country you wan na obtain your citizenship , that you actually live in the country . 
  that 's how it works to obtain the citizenship in a country where it is not just a political tool to be wielded by idiots . 
   i think it all comes down to this , you think it 's a bad idea , i think it 's not . 
  no , i have proof it is a bad idea and it was abused . 
   but it 's not arbitrary `` i do n't like your face , you wo n't get citizenship '' , `` your romanian has too much moldovan accent you do n't get citizenship '' , wtf are you talking about ? 
  b ) - e ) . 
  you have to prove that you are loyal to the romanian state though actions and attitude , through their behaviour . 
  that is a completely random concept . 
  it is not based on actual provable facts and it is up the people deciding of my nationality if i respect that . 
  the fact that this law was in practice in 91 but was only massively implemented since basescu , shows that it was used in a bullshit manner . 
  they gave it to people who friggin publicly declared that they wan na use it just a means to go to western europe . 
  the conditions were watered down , citizenship was used as a political tool and not as a consacration of the fact that you worked had to show you 're part of a new home . 
   it was founded and christianity was founded by a hippy ... your point being ? 
  afd in its comments is just as bad , if not even worse than current day fn . 
  you understand the difference between `` can be given '' and `` will be given '' ? 
  so which one of your points applies to people with romanian parents . 
  because no 40-30-20 yo moldavian had romanian parents . 
  you shout how it 's the law . 
  show me where 's the law that says if you had romanian grandparents , you 'll get romanian citizenship . 
   even afd is somewhat light , in comparison to fn , not really no . 
  le pen father became a complete buffoon after his `` the crematories of auschwitz were just a detail of history '' ( notice he did n't say they do n't exist , just that they 're a detail , something very similar to the current afd comment ) . 
   normalising germany 's history through a just revisionism , w it is part of german history . 
  there is a german holocaust museum in berlin , just like there 's a holocaust museum in paris . 
   would mean current generations are n't ridden with guilt of actions done by the nazi regime . 
  the germans i know do n't seem particularly guilt striken and paralised with shame . 
  if i were german , i 'd be more pissed about the shitty jokes we constantly see . 
  in fucking 1975 we had jokes that mocked idiots that can not stop `` mentioning the war '' but we still have family guy and sausage party . 
   hate their own german roots weird . 
  the germans i know are the cockiest bastards you 'd meet . 
  they 're unbearable about how much better germany is at everything yadda yadda yadda . 
  maybe it 's a question about personal characteristics and not general crap . 
   yes it does , there are laws about that . 
  no there are no laws . 
  literally there is no obligation to give someone citizenship . 
  look at the swiss that do n't vote that chick for citizenship even though she grew up there . 
   why is that ? 
  was it not according to the law ? 
  just because there 's a law , does n't make it a stupid . 
  it 's stupid . 
   it 's lesser benefit than before , but yeah it 's a benefit , so what ? 
  yeah ... a lot of romanians left romania after it joined the eu ... 
  i 'm sure it was all a coincidence and that a eu passport has little benefits . 
  getting the right of work or not needing any visa for longer than 90 days must be really not important,
