   we ca n't keep have major mission components fail , and then comfort ourselves saying that not everything was a loss . 
  everything working as expected should be the norm , not a major victory . 
  you sound ignorant af concerning space missions . 
  yeah dude shit happens . 
  the first ariane 5 blew up because a floating point error . 
  columbia because rubber band got brittle . 
  hubble was sent into space with a faulty fucking mirror . 
  shit happens with cutting edge technology you put on a rock far from any maintenance and i can spend all day talking about them . 
   the citizenship is a right sure . 
  i 'll come to romania and ask for my right cuz fuck it !, 
  you have no clue how citizenship works ? 
  a country has no obligation to give you citizenship . 
   if the law allows children of romanian parents to get citizenship these are people that got citizenship because their grandparents were born in romania . 
  that 's wrong . 
   nowadays moldovans can travel freely in europe with their moldovan passports , so that 's a moot point . 
  they are not eu citizens so they do n't have the right to work or claim benefits as eu citizens . 
  any eu citizen with insufficient means can ask up to 550 euros per month to study and have 20 % of their rent paid by the state . 
  a romanian can claim those benefits , a moldavian can not . 
  claiming this is n't a massive benefit is ridiculous . 
  yes . 
  we all know how [ space missions are so easy . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_shuttle ) . 
  get over youself . 
  seems that mommy may got to keep the crying baby . 
  well about thaaat ... there was this austrian student that was a bit of a cocky dick throughout the year and once when he presented a team project , he was talking to their proposition as the `` ultimate solution '' and well ... 
  i just could n't not do it . 
  with the germans though ... 82 never forget !, 
  [ punch was served , check with poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qshcc-py6s ), 
   it 's obviously that us , the elites , are vastly out of touch with the regular citizens ' wishes and worries . 
  please staaahp . 
  your mockery is the reason that le pen got elected :'(, 
   `` germans are the only people in the world who plant a monument of shame in the capital , '' til that [ we 're germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c3%a9morial_de_la_shoah ) :'), 
   why would they not be entitled to get the citizenship back ? 
  because the vast majority of them have not lived 1 day in romania ? 
  because they know next to nothing about romania society , romanian laws ? 
  because you do n't give citizenship so easily ? 
  because there 's more to citizenship than the fact that your grandparents were romanian and you speak romanian ? 
  because a ton use it just as a quick passport to western europe ? 
  do you want more reasons ? 
   hm , surprised that they picked paris over amsterdam . 
  you need people to hire and let 's look at two rankings : http://www.best-masters.com/ranking-master-financial-markets.html here out of the top 10 , the first 8 are american and the rest are french . 
  and http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-finance-pre-experience-2015 number 1 , 3 , 6,7 , 8 are french . 
  in 2016 this was http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-finance-pre-experience-2016 number 1,2 , 4,7,10 . 
  and these only include the business side of things . 
  the quant/maths side of things with the likes of polytechnique , centrale , ens are not included . 
   as for bessarabia there 's nothing that us romanians can do , now . 
  out of the last 200 + years we 've gotten hold of it for only 25 years or so or over the 500 years , it was connected to romanian moldavia for 325 years or so ? 
  maybe romanian should stop giving citizenship to moldavians that are susceptible to not vote retards , so they can leave the country ? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38649169  i find it hard to imagine he ran to a hotel to meet our girls of ` low social responsibility ' ... though they are of course also the best in the world . 
  but ** i doubt trump took that bait ** . 
  emphasis mine . 
  so was bait offered then ? 
   new york times published an editorial titled `` romania 's anti-corruption mania wut ? 
  ny times publishes bullshit [ opinions ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/18/opinion/our-war-with-france.html ) and [ biased ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/world/europe/burkini-ban-muslim-women.html?_r=0 ) articles ? 
  no waaaay man . 
  ny would never publish faulty [ crap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judith_miller#the_iraq_war ), 
  yes . 
  that chain link fence will last 1000 years  . 
  how na\u00efve can one be ? 
   you argue that there has been a monotonous trend towards unification no . 
  i am arguing that the current structures that we see and assume that will last of millenia ... will actually not and they 're just a stepping stone to something different . 
   but you also say that europe went from empires to smaller , split up nation states . 
  you 'd understand my comment better if you read it and not assume that it means what you think it does . 
   the european union was n't originally a threat to self-determination , it was simply a customs and passport union with some shared regulation . 
  and the french revolution started because bread was expensive . 
  you of all people should realise that your borders wo n't last for long . 
  did you read the article?the vote may 's talking about is concerning the brexit deal ... 
  up is relative . 
  http://www.xe.com/fr/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=1y here 's the one year graph . 
  brexit clearly affected it , no doubt about it . 
  it had a major slump in oct/nov . 
  and now they 're going over the second slump , less sever than the oct/nov one . 
  but worse than dec. . let 's stop looking at 1 day trading events with high volatility products . 
   we should bend over and allow frau merkel to fuck us over . 
  i 'm sorry what ? 
  uk wants to change how foreigners are treated . 
  frau merkel wants ** everything to stay as is ** , meaning people like / u/caffeinatedt living life as before . 
   unity good , division bad . 
  yes . 
  eu good , ww2 bad . 
  it 's not hard to understand . 
   the eu will need to retaliate to stop the unfair practice . 
  the eu needs to strenghten its bonds . 
  we had a europe of tribes , then a europe of feudals , then a europe of empires , then a europe of nation-states , now a europe of multinationals ... the next step is breaking the barriers and create a united europe . 
  that is the future of humanity . 
  we will tend towards one , be it tomorrow or in 1000 years . 
  but it will happen . 
  just like country x y and z did n't exist 1000 years ago , it will not exist 1000 years from now . 
  but we have the power to decide where we go . 
  we have on this continent some of the most inovative and productive people , some of the most diverse mindsets . 
  we can either forge our own destinity together , or be bothered by petty squables and minor details . 
  edit : because some people seem confused about my message . 
  it is n't about any particular specific thing , form or political entity , but about realising the greater long term trends . 
  like it or not , the universal trend is about considering more and more people when one person says `` we '' . 
  stop being bogged down by particular events and local realities . 
  yes there is a distinct possibility that the eu wo n't exist in some years , that the euro will be taken down , that schengen will disappear . 
  but there are points of * no return * . 
  we do n't realise it , but we wo n't return to bordered up europe . 
  that 's it . 
  it 's gone . 
  the days of franco-german wars are done .
