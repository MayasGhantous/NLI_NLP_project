  okay fine . 
  i believe / u/jtalin was in the right because all that / u/stuijfsande did was some stupid ass sound-bite with no real substance to it . 
  if a pidgeon shits on your hat , you do n't start a philosophical debate , you just say it 's a shit bird and move on . 
  heck look at this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ngb5c/austria_to_ask_eu_for_right_to_hire_locals_ahead/dcbrcia/ guy drops a shit comment `` oh we 're democrats here and over there you 're terrorists '' then proceeds to complain that others are self-righteous and lack arguments . 
  the dude does ** not ** understand the irony of his own comments . 
  he acts self-righteous and he presents 0 arguments to the debate that is happening . 
  he only helps to poison the debate and make the thread a shit slinginging match . 
   your fact is ` treaties are made to be followed ' , while your opponent says ` treaties are made to be amended ' . 
  treaties are amended is a consensus arrises . 
  the fact that uk tried to achieve a consensus and it was blocked by the vast majority of countries shows that there is no consensus . 
  in the case of the eu , you actually need unanimity . 
  austria wants to unilaterally change fucking agreements . 
  heck take the agreements : `` guys let not invade sovereign countries '' . 
  surely you agree that you 'd need an unanimous decision to overrule said agreement . 
  and if one country decides unilaterally to break that agreement , that does not bode well for said country . 
   that 's a difference in opinion between you as an authocrat and him/her as a democrat . 
  what if tomorrow people of country r decide that hey all previous agreements they signed are pointless and that if they want region c that belongs to country u , they are free to invade it . 
  claiming that asking to respect agreements is autrocraty is plain stupid . 
   also , one wrong does not justify another wrong , irrespective of whether the word ` autocrat ' is a negative term . 
  well ignorant should not be a negative term either . 
  i am ignorant of many a thing . 
  what should be the negative is perseverence in ignorance . 
  i think you 're overestimating the amount of eu infrastructure investments . 
  in ee there is a massive catch-up and you could say that it 's a boom but i do n't think it 's due to eu spending but actually increased commerce . 
   but not their surplus workforce . 
  and sadly there might not be a surplus workforce for long , since birth rates in the south are [ dwindling ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38582100 ) . 
  but people want their cake and eat it too . 
  and who wants some crumbs can fuck off . 
  no no . 
  you do n't understand . 
  we * need * to discriminate against the people we dislike . 
  western europeans are fine because their rich and their home country can fuck us up . 
  eastern europeans ? 
   , it need n't be discriminatory on paper it is discriminatory because it seems that the employer must prove they did not find someone in their own country for the job, 
  i do n't ruby on rails but i assume that does not know the difference between knowing and `` knowing '' a language as demonstrated by the fizz buzz test . 
  well poland has the support of saint kitts and nevis , san cristobal y nieves , saint christophe et ni\u00e9v\u00e8s . 
  that 's 3 countries right there . 
  if `` ifs '' and `` buts '' were candy and nuts , we 'd all have a merry christmas . 
  the left is divided this year sadly since everybody and their mother want to be president . 
  is the smile extra ? 
   usually of some mystery `` meat '' ftfy, 
  she campaigned against circus animals and against church bells banging away ( bit ironic that that bothers the swiss ... which voted to no longer build minarets ) . 
  perfect example of insular communities . 
   the blue banana is a zone of widespread economic activity myes . 
  wallonie and nord pas de calais . 
  dude if you wan na keep parroting poor geography and economics , be my guest . 
  well i think the gdp of paris is still larger than that of a sea . 
  it 's just a bullshit thing made by a dude that reeaaaally wanted to stand out . 
  and in france , the way to stand out is to say that paris sucks ass . 
   you moved once , why would n't you move again ? 
  yeah but now you get unemployment benefits . 
   the thing with migrants is they go as easy as they come if things are not good . 
  here 's the number of romanians in italy ( there are more than polish in uk even though the pop of poland if about 40 % larger than the pop of romania ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_italy hardly any decrease at all . 
  wtf is this article . 
  has zero proof of its claims ... -1, 
  guardbart is n't bad either . 
  rhymes with fart . 
  read the article . 
  they adjust for that . 
  picketty is n't an idiot . 
  fascinating recital of tier 2 stereotypes . 
   as part of the blue banana the blue banana is bullshit . 
  you have a sea in there for christ 's sake . 
   ( especially when you 're a manager or an executive ) that 's because you 're not paid by the hour . 
  sucks for spain and italy that absorbed the flow of romanians . 
  books are not just information . 
  articles are meant to be pure information so yes . 
  but books also contain the style . 
  the work the author puts in to present the topic in a creative and useful manner . 
  that 's not information , that 's not data . 
  that 's the personal input of the author . 
  and i 'm sorry , that should be valued . 
  some do get paid a fee but two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  a book ( even in science ) is very much a creative endeavour . 
  that should be acknowledged . 
  i 'm sure on sci hub you 'll only find books by dead authors . 
  if the author is dead i mean yeah . 
  concerning berkeley physics books i do n't know how that works . 
  if they agreed to it maybe . 
  well it 's the same reason why i do n't agree with pirating windows . 
  there 's a free available os . 
  articles have stuff that you can not find anywhere else . 
  by and large books generally have the important concepts from elsewhere . 
   white female americans still kill more people on average than most european countries it 's because of you know ... that time of the month problems . 
  check out the origin of the word hysteria ... 
   checks at distribution that make the difference in gun violence rather than gun laws themselves are n't checks at distribution part of gun laws ? 
  and you got ta think that other types of laws such stand your ground do appear to increase raw homicide rates .

  except when there 's school shootings . 
  have n't seen professional darts players have you ? 
  i dislike it because they also offer books ... 
  articles i understand , but books , sorry i do n't agree with offering them for free . 
  you might enjoy this article from a [ french economist ] ( http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2017/01/09/of-productivity-in-france-and-in-germany/ ) that shows that france and germany and the us have the same productivity levels . 
  so the us is only richer because they work more . 
  france dips a tiny bit when factoring in unemployment . 
   but the conclusion remains the sames : the us is crazy rich even by european standards . 
  that 's because you 're doing poor stats . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_time the americans work 1,789 h per week , the french work 1,473 h and the germans 1,371 h. 
  when you adjust for this factor , you obtain the amazing result that the productivity : gdp/hour worked is ** the same ** in france , germany and the us . 
  so americans are richer , but that 's cuz they work much more .
