  http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2017/01/09/of-productivity-in-france-and-in-germany/ and [ this graph ] ( http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/files/2017/01/pikettybloglemonde03012017dataf1f9en_page_1-768x543.jpg ) we lost * a bit * of the productivity wrt togermany and the us when we adjust for higher unemployment . 
  not really no . 
  uk was an outer element . 
  continental europe is much much better off within the eu . 
  i think this is best for both . 
   it got back up , of course did it now ? 
  http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=1y looks like there 's a dip in there at the middle of the year . 
  why oh why ? 
  http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=1y dip still present against the euro . 
  leaving the eea is pretty significant . 
  uk will have to negotiate a new free trade deal with the eu . 
  also pasporting rights will go out the window :p, 
  not really no . 
  the persian empire was known to be tolerant towards other religions . 
  and that 's 200 years before the romans even appeared on the map . 
  the romans were kind of a dick . 
  going about and conquering other people . 
   a proposal to be accepted by the other side uk is in the eu . 
  and eu citizenns can stay in other countries as much as they want . 
  why does n't uk pass the law regardless ? 
   once the uk leaves , uk citizens would no longer be able to live in those country 's and could be deported under existing laws . 
  how would i know that uk will leave ? 
  only a non biding referendum ? 
  no law was passed . 
  no art was triggered . 
   seems to me that the status quo still stands . 
  and it 's a good status quo . 
  we do n't need to do anything . 
  also seems to me that you want to * negotiate * since you wo n't pass laws stating eu citizens can stay . 
  holding people hostage it seems . 
   the uk parliament ca n't prevent france or germany from deporting uk citizen living there did the french of german govt express such a desire ? 
  seems to me that the * only country that wants to change the status quo * is uk . 
    so it needs the approval of the rest of the eu for a reciprocal agreement . 
  that reciprocal agreement exists already . 
  it 's called the eu . 
   because the uk ca n't pass a law saying uk citizens in the eu can stay it needs the eus approval for that do n't be ridiculous . 
  the uk parliament is the highest authority in uk . 
  and they can pass any law they wish that 'll grant more rights to foreign citizens . 
  just like it can pass practically any law that restricts rights . 
  ( which it wants to do apparently , if not we would n't be having this convoy ) . 
  why does the eu need to give approval if uk wants to pass a law ? 
  the parliament is the supreme authority . 
  how is uk doing what it set out to do , namely triggering art 50 equate bending over and getting fucked . 
  you must be a brexiter . 
  it 's like talking to a wall . 
  freedom of movement has existed for a long time . 
  even ** before ** the eea . 
  freedom of movement of capital and pasporting rights are more new and need common laws and standards . 
  you confuse what 's possible and what 's probable . 
  it 's possible to convince the eu to pay you . 
  it 's not probable though . 
  and i 'm done here . 
  cheers . 
   yet suddenly we 're offered one of the four freedoms on its own !, 
  astounding !, 
  how did that happen ? 
  maybe they 're not so inseparable after all . 
  do you understand that you are ** not offered the 4 freedoms ** ? 
  unless you 're capital . 
  are you made of money ? 
  are you a british pound that obtained sentience ? 
   `` all the ~ ~ uk ~ ~ eu had to do was bend over and get fucked !, 
  what was the problem ? '', 
   so in effect britain would have access to freedom of movement * sigh * read again . 
  this proposal creates a class of citizens that have freedom of movement . 
  we never had a problem with freedom of movement . 
  again the eu ** does not want to punish british citizens ** . 
  we lived very well together up to this point . 
  we will manage after . 
  uk on the other hand has a chip on its shoulder and wants to leave . 
  if uk wants to leave the eea then uk ** companies ** wo n't have free trade or passporting rights ( give or take certain precautions ) . 
  tl ; dr : eu is happy to give uk ** citizens ** any rights they wish . 
  for uk ** companies ** that 's a different story . 
   do you understand the issues at play here now ? 
  the eu put the offer on the table but uk wo n't trigger art 50 . 
  again uk wants to change stuff , so uk should comply . 
  we do n't want to change anything . 
  we 're happy to way things are . 
  if uk wants to implement laws saying they 'll kick out eu citizens , well good luck with that , 
   why would arabs control it ? 
  they do n't . 
   ... but only it 's a proposal and is n't a guarantee . 
  all uk had to do is trigger art 50 , 
   may 's proposal it 's a proposal and is n't a guarantee . 
  it would help if you re-read what the proposition is . 
   interesting that this guy would offer the same to those of us not living in the eu , though . 
  you are living in the eu . 
   so freedom of movement can be separated from the other famous pillars of the single market after all ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
   it 's possible to pick from among them like this ? 
  you are an eu citizen and the eu will want to extend that for those that are willing . 
  but since eu citizenship it not like any normal one , it might not extend to your children if they 're born after this proposal ends , etc etc, 
   's a proposal and is n't a guarantee . 
  so may passed a law saying that eu citizens can stay ? 
   the uk government was willing to let people know their future was secure right away . 
  so that was a proposal not a guarantee . 
   the official position on the future of eu citizens in the uk is ` lol no negotiation yet ' . 
  of course . 
   you are not leaving yet . 
  you 're the third butthurt brit i 'm posting this to :d http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-citizenship-keep-freedom-of-movement-guy-verhofstadt-chief-negotiator-opt-in-passports-a7465271.html,
