  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-citizenship-keep-freedom-of-movement-guy-verhofstadt-chief-negotiator-opt-in-passports-a7465271.html offering eu citizenship is n't telling people to fuck off , regardless of how little you care for it . 
   corrected dacian to thracian , although there were a few dacian as well now it 's renaultian, 
   well , emperor constantine decided to take a barbaric cult , which his vulgar mother ( a tavern wench and possibly a prostitute ) was following and to make it into the official religion of the roman empire well you 're pretty darn ingorant . 
  the edict of milan only meant that christianity became a tolerated religion of the empire . 
  it was theodosius 1st who made christianity the official religion of the empire by the [ edict of thessalonica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edict_of_thessalonica ) in 380 . 
   they were perhaps too tolerant . 
  well considering that it took christianity 250 years to become ** tolerated ** and the fact that roman emperors would regularly expel jews from rome [ like claudius and tiberius did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/claudius'_expulsion_of_jews_from_rome ) or building temples to roman gods on the temple mount in jerusalem then when revolt insues , they banned all [ jewish from jerusalem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bar_kokhba_revolt ) i would n't call them too tolerant . 
  yeah . 
  it was more interesting to see / r/israel at the end of december . 
  that was a real shit show . 
   area c which is technically israeli controlled land . 
  well they are not meant to control all of it buddy . 
   eu is both anti-izrael and anti-uk . 
  how is the eu any of those ? 
  we do not offer unconditional support to israel . 
  does that make one anti-israel ? 
  did they change definitions on words ? 
   everyone employed in any country get registered automatically by the employer i 'm pretty sure the employer would be pretty pissed if someone they deemed worthy of being hired now has to leave work to go to mandatory classes . 
   you can target this kind of policy to communities for which it is really becoming a problem so who decides what a problem is who causes said problems ? 
   those who are not employed are registered for the unemployment benefits so the government know them too . 
  if you 've never worked in a country , you really wo n't receive unemployment benefits . 
  if you worked in that country , then the employer knows better what his needs are . 
   registration certificate for stays longer than 3-6 months ( in almost all european countries ) even if you are an eu citizen .

  http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/10930 not to mention that in no shape or form is a 3mo ` th stay a long term immigrant . 
   should have mandatory language classes . 
  for whom ? 
  there 's no means to detect who 's a temporary migrant and who 'll stay on for years and years . 
  are the italians the only ones with a male performer in top 3 ? 
  ( we 'll assume kim kardashian is a female for the sake of a debate ), 
  most do take on their own accord . 
  others feel it is useless . 
  it would have been pointless for me to learn flemish . 
  and quite a few students here do n't bother learning french and make do . 
  why do people get hard-ons on pushing stuff on other people ? 
   intra eu migration is a different issue and frankly does not need `` forced language classes '' because it comes natural . 
  so is it all immigrants need mandatory classes or only immigrants i feel like screwing over . 
  because i 've heard of brits might complain that quite a few poles did n't learn the language . 
   also there is a difference between a `` temporary '' migrant and a permanent one . 
  what is the difference ? 
  how would the state identify me if i 'm a permanent immigrant in the eu for example ? 
  because the state has to identify me in order to force me to attend language classes . 
   it 's a measure to help integration i 'm pretty sure grown ups know better what 's good for them , 
   that immigrants should take lessons in ( one of ) why not all ? 
   also , you still have n't told what are the incompatibilies . 
  you are the one that talked about incompatibilities . 
   beyond this , i really do n't see europeans as immigrants when you move from spain to germany . 
  you may not see them as such , that does not make them any less ( more ) of an immigrant . 
   i feel like there 's a difference between a mandatory course for pupils and it being mandatory for everyone to speak it . 
  i feel so too . 
   such a course does n't necessarily apply to expats and immigrants and it 's really up to them to learn it . 
  of course . 
  but the british proposal is on all immigrants to go to mandatory classes . 
  yes . 
  and english is mandatory in english schools . 
  and bright heads think that ** all ** immigrants should take mandatory classes in english . 
  by extension , then all immigrants to belgium should take mandatory classes in french and flemish . 
  you want to know the differences between the jewish culture and the french culture ? 
  * language , customs , beliefs , cuisine . 
   could you elaborate ? 
  better ask / u/kapom what he meant by adopting `` local culture '' . 
  http://www.enseignement.be/index.php/index.php?page=25228&amp;navi=3128 it is mandatory as second language for pupils . 
   immigrants usually stay for undefined time . 
  that is not the definition of an immigrant . 
  if you live in another country , you are an immigrant . 
   what 's incompatible here ? 
  just as many incompatibilities as between the french culture and other semitic cultures . 
   bruxelles has 2 official languages and the second is french . 
  flemish is mandatory in the 19 communes of bruxelles as the second language . 
  some people might find it * obvious * then that immigrants should also have to have mandatory flemish classes . 
   and more importantly , do n't prevent your children to learn the language well the proposition is about mandatory classes for immigrants . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chuka-umunna-immigrants-should-be-made-to-learn-english-on-arrival-in-uk-classes-esol-social-a7509666.html and unless you wan na spend your life there , i frankly do n't see why immigrants should be forced to take classes . 
   and adopt the local culture . 
  so how will we make the jewish adopt our culture ? 
  cuz i bet they 'll be thrilled . 
   at least he is not the one who did `` quantitative easing '' aka let 's print money and give them to banks . 
  i 'm sure he 'll be very different  ) ) ) ) . 
  drain the swamp !, 
   this comes one day after a brit politician said migrants should learn english when arriving in the uk . 
  what is it ? 
  the week of the obviousness ? 
  how is it obvious that immigrants should learn the language with mandatory classes ? 
  i 've lived for 5 months in bruxelles and i had no desire to learn any flemish . 
  again , if they live in said country , they 're not tourists . 
  you understand the difference between tourist and immigrant ? 
  tourists stay a few days or weeks then leave . 
  british pensioners are ** not ** tourists . 
   sure , the only thing they are afraid and concerned about are eastern european thieves and burglars . 
  well i 've been burglarised and many of my friends and colleagues know at least two neighbours that have been burglarised , also have a friend that had his car stollen . 
  and despite living in nice , only a friend told me that they kiiiinda knew a couple that was killed . 
  i mean yeah terrorists attacks are more gut wrenching and on an emotional level they do feel much much worse . 
  but in terms of stuff that will actually affect me ... 
   i feel safe , but my life has changed . 
  yeah man . 
  ` member the roaring 60s and 70s and [ how safe they were ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-03/hijackings.png ), 
   did i get that right ? 
  goddamit , it 's cucks . 
  that 's the word you 're supposed to use . 
  at least it has the friggin definition of immigrant . 
  go read a dictionary .
