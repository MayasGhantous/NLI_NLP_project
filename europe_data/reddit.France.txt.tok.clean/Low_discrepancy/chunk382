   if they have a valid passport and can freely return home , then they are not immigrants . 
  holy fuck . 
  you do n't know the definition of immigrants . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration here you go dude . 
  read . 
  do they live in said country ? 
  then they 're immigrants . 
  again how is that different than ump bending down to sarkozy or cdu/csu to merkel etc etc etc ? 
  immigrants have to integrate, 
  barron who ? 
  barron trump or what ? 
  if i knew anything about him , yeah . 
  so who 'll give lessons to those british pensioners living in spain or south of france ? 
  this is about immigrants and not refugees . 
  he 's the leader of the party . 
  how does it surprise you that he has the highest influence in said party ? 
  how are your twitter skills ? 
   liviu dragnea , the leader of the social democratic party , and the speaker of the chamber of deputies . 
  so the leader of the party controls the party : o. omg that 's unheard of . 
  weird . 
  we have the chicks but not the black dude . 
   black people are in no way a beauty standard in eastern europe because we have little to no exposure to them . 
  yeah . 
  i bet ee think halle berry is meh . 
   special czech leaflet the czech treatment : whiter !, 
  atms are n't hospitality . 
  for hospitality jobs , you need people ... 
  if i go to a hotel , i 'll need a real person to clean up the rooms , if i go to a restaurant i like it when my food is actually prepared and when it 's brought to my table . 
  this are services for which i am glad to pay more . 
   , but a part of forces would go from balkans to cut them off earlier . 
  a part of what forces ? 
  sounds like extremely wishful thinking on your part . 
  the soviet forces were about 6 million in april 1945 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_front_ ( world_war_ii ), 
  berlin was conquered on may 2nd . 
  first nuclear test took place on july 16th . 
  so no , the americans did n't have nukes . 
   churchills plan was allowed to cut off ussr armies before they went past their borders how would one go about doing such a thing ? 
  a superpower being blocked by ... well ... definitely not a superpower . 
  edit : heck the race was to berlin and the soviets won that . 
  uk was not even close to poland when the ussr was crossing the border . 
  let me help the putin bots : america does it too , and far worse !, 
   because they came as asylum seekers you can not be an asylum seeker and a eu national ... 
  that 's because you grew up in a no-go zone . 
  we got ta nuke our own countries too . 
  in case the terrorists already crossed the borders . 
   is willing to cooperate in protecting the external border . 
  no terrorist has swimmed across the med to cause a terrorist strike then left by hiking through russia . 
  all the terrorists were either locals or known by the authorities . 
  and terrorists have crossed borders in europe for a long long long time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans-joachim_klein but we can also include the basques or italian leftist terrorists that came to france . 
   it just makes it more difficult for terrorists to move around , in certain situations . 
  so for an event that happens twice a year they decide to fuck up everybody 's travel plans . 
  makes sense . 
  the paris attacker left france by car . 
  friends picked him up . 
  a terrorist can rent a car before a terrorist attack and move around europe as much as he wants before his identity is revealed . 
  honestly it 's bullshit . 
  what they should do is close the borders when there 's a terrorist attack . 
  do n't be silly . 
  i suggest we nuke every neighbouring country . 
   we can make things harder for terrorists . 
  at least , that is the main idea . 
  i 'm sure it 'll work !, 
  but they 're also unlikely to get automated very soon ( at least not more than they already are ), 
  i was based on this https://www.justlanded.fr/english/denmark/denmark-guide/jobs/danish-social-security  the benefits received can be up to a maximum of 90 % of the member 's income from their previous job , and are paid out around every three or four weeks . 
  all members are entitled to receive unemployment benefits for a maximum of four years in total , and membership automatically ends when a member reaches the age of 65 . 
  probably an old website . 
  denmark has unemployment benefits for up to 4 years , spain up to 2 . 
  ca n't really compare the two . 
   the moment they pull the plug a lot of our conforts will be gone . 
  yours yes ( see migrant crisis , though eu collapsing would result in the same thing if turkey opens the flood gates ) . 
  but us here , meh we 've still got nukes . 
   europe is superior to the us when in reality the us leads the worlds in almost every aspect . 
  from geopolitics to economic influence etc. 
  that 's because you 're in greece . 
  but in normal countries , geopolitics and economic influences does n't put food on the table or pay health care . 
   an suv brand which won paris-dakar more than once . 
  romanian mathematics 0  1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dakar_rally#list_of_winners feel free to check if any romanian car has won even a stage at paris dakar . 
   the most notable one of which is the aro oh which the aro 10 had a renault 12 engine . 
  not to mention that aro no longer exist . 
  you 're welcome for renault . 
   and renault can go fuck itself after taking our dacia brand and sucking that moroccan dick by making almost 70 % of all dacias outside romania . 
  without renault you 'd make 0 % of dacia 's . 
  romania has yet to produce an original home made car . 
  you were building renault 12s until 2004 . 
  a car introduced in 1969 . 
   contribute well is n't it odd that you consider these people as contributing to the gdp of their country but when a foreign company like renault heavily invests in dacia or carrefour opens up cheap supermarkets , magically it becomes a `` the evil hordes of foreigners are taking our moneys '' . 
  we should not forget the * [ 1.15 m romanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_italy ) living in italy , up from 350k in 2006 ( and 75k in 2001 ) . 
  * [ 750k romanians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_spain ) living in spain , up from 400k in 2006 ( 31k in 2001 ) * [ 220k romanians in uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_the_united_kingdom ) ( up from 7.6 k in 2001 ) this means that in 2013 alone , they sent [ 4.2 billion euros ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romanian-migrants-send-home-more-in-remittances-data-show-that-romanians-working-abroad-sent-home-10-per-cent-more-money-last-year-than-they-did-in-2012 ) back home . 
   but at least ** part ** of the difference is due to the subsidy . 
  ftfy , 
   and was independant for a long long time . 
  gaul was conquered between 58-50 . 
  and massalia was conquered in 49 . 
  1 year is hardly a long long time . 
  smth smth roman empire . 
  let the italians have it . 
  you can have it for free . 
  heck , we 'll pay you !, 
   we consider eastern europeans culturally compatible yes .
