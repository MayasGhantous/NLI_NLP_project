  sawlty much , 
  sawlty much , 
  salty , 
  you are a lefty . 
   it is wrong to suggest a class specifically refers to only about 25 people . 
  are you french ? 
   that is your job and duty . 
  my job and duty is to respect the law  . 
  i suggest you do the same if you visit france . 
  or you will go to jail, 
  you do realise fdsouche is extreme right rag , huh ? 
  what next ? 
  sturmfront ? 
  it 'll survive you just like it survived your parents and grandparents , 
   bobos bien-pensants you forgot bisounours , gauchiasse , bleeding heart and leftard . 
  i know you can do much much better . 
  do n't hold back . 
   , i do n't think he should be prosecuted for that call the judges then . 
  i 'm sure they 'll listen to you , 
  now that 's melodramatic, 
  i have no idea what is in the mind of that dude or what he means . 
  in france you can not make statistics based on ethnicities ( except in some extreme situations so mayors can not do it ) , we do n't know where he got his numbers ... 
  but he has the weird belief that the french are being replaced by mooooosleeeeems . 
   ump has million of debt for age and still manage to get credit again , banks have started to refuse giving out loans . 
   but when it comes to the fn , bank do n't want to lend anything . 
  did you not read how in 2012 socgen gave them a loan ? 
   also his country , where he can campaign to change the rules good luck to him  . 
  until then , he respects the laws of the french republic . 
  as / u/stuckinsocks has difficulties understanding basic english , he is free to ask a french person what menard meant by his line instead of jumping to conclusions . 
  that seems like the most reasonable thing , does it not  ? 
  wtf are you talking about !, 
  school = hundreds of people . 
  how is that difference `` irrelevant '' . 
   `` class '' is a noun that can be both singular and plural . 
  the plural of class is classes . 
  learn to read buddy . 
  it 's a useful skill . 
  he said is `` class '' . 
  singular . 
  that means about 25 people . 
  i think we 'll survive the fact that somewhere in france there are 24 students with a foreign sounding name . 
  if you do not think that that situation is bearable , go to magnan and wait there . 
  maybe you 'll get lucky , 
  m\u00e9nard is a citizen of france . 
  as such he has to respect the laws that are in france . 
  if that bothers him , he can leave . 
  our country , we set the rules , 
  it 's not possible  in a ** class ** in the city centre in my town , 91 percent of the children are muslims . 
  / r/europe just upvotes people who ca n't read . 
  and we complain about post-truth and fake news . 
  people ca n't even read ** real ** news . 
   the proportion of muslims in that school go from 0 to 91 % can you read ? 
   in a ** class ** in the city centre in my town , 91 percent of the children are muslims . 
  learn to read buddy . 
  it 's an essential skill nowadays . 
  can you read ? 
  it 's certainly higher than / u/stuckinsocks 's reading skills  in a ** class ** in the city centre in my town , 91 percent of the children are muslims . 
   let 's find a common ground , shall we ? 
  is de gaulle palatable to you ? 
   here is a quote from him : in what grand speech did he make this quote ? 
  oh that 's riiiiight . 
  it was just a random conversation presented in a book that he did n't write . 
   greek and latin culture , yeah . 
  bretons and basques i 'm sure really appreciate this quote . 
  they 're discovering that they 're not actually french . 
   so yeah , this is what french people proud of their roots have to deal with in the core of france nowadays . 
  no buddy . 
  you are not a person proud of their roots , you are a person that uses their make belief origins to shit on others . 
  you are the type of person that hates the other french . 
  today those with foreign `` roots '' , yesteday you would have hated bretons and called them ploucs ( yokels ) https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/plouc you are the type of idiot that suppressed proven\u00e7al language decades ago . 
  they were a bunch of xenophobic idiots that destroyed a lot of culture in france because they decided what was french and what was not . 
  and you are their heir . 
  luckly , we know better to not give people like you any power . 
   for the english readers here the little boy that cried wolf . 
   by that time 2014 election were over and ps & ump both got bank loans ) you should have voted for the regionals buddy . 
  they were in december 2015 . 
  and regionals actually do matter . 
   should they have organised like ump and you had to pay to vote or like the ps witch got a very nice loan from the state . 
  both primaries , you have to pay . 
   by the way , is n't primaries what your charles degaulle your ? 
  you 're not even french ? 
  no wonder you 're lost . 
  and i do n't live in 1958 . 
  i live in 2016 ... 
  things change in 58 years buddy . 
   lepen political party is stating for 2years now , that no french bank accepts to give them funds for political campaigning bullshit . 
  http://www.europe1.fr/politique/pourquoi-les-banques-se-mefient-des-partis-politiques-1366506 ever since the ump scandal , banks have started to refuse giving loans to political parties . 
  ( in fact fn got a loan from socgen in 2012 , but now banks have said fuck it , not worth it ) http://www.politico.eu/article/national-front-marine-le-pen-far-right-groups-ordered-to-pay-european-parliament-e800000/ fn have already been shown to do weird stuff with the funds they get . 
  if they want money for their campaign , maybe they should be organising primaries like every other party did  ump got a massive amount of money . 
  they should also ask for donations . 
  i have an ancestor who at the age of 6 was spitting in the soup that was meant for the occupying prussian soldiers . 
  what did your ancestor tell them ? 
  [ gardes votre or je garde ma puissance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlogkjhigoq&amp;t=2m18s )  ) ) ) dude , i think you got told bullshit stories from propaganda songs . 
   except one who is swiss - nobody is perfect - . 
   the political pressure we can exert as one bloc is far higher than any individual country can muster , thing is ... we 're not a block . 
  how could the guy serve time in italy then find himself in germany ? 
  we just pass the problem to the country next to us , whatever country that might be . 
  we do not have block like reactions , as we can see in the paris attacks where one country went into freak out mode and the other was meh ... it 'll pass guys . 
  we created schengen but it was like putting the cart in front of the horse . 
  we used to have borders inside countries but unified police force , unified secret services etc made it possible to remove those borders .
