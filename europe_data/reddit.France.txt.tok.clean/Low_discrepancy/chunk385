   we do n't like le pen 's euroscepticism , but she 'll make do are you aware how french elections work ? 
  do you know anything about france or have you spent too much time on l_p and t_d ? 
   anyone with unproven names , origin and past is a potential threat and should be treated accordingly . 
  how many people is that ? 
  the dude left after one year of highschool ? 
  nor a [ nobel prize in science ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/claude_cohen-tannoudji ), 
   you 're exagerating quite a bit . 
  true . 
  you can get arrested for having the wrong wifi name http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/frenchman-given-suspended-sentence-for-naming-his-wi-fi-network-daesh-21/, 
  you must write a full paragraph or it 's not fun :(, 
  you sound like the greeks that start mentioning ww2 when germany talks about debt . 
  top kek :d, 
  paging / u/relnor because he thinks romanians like you do n't exist . 
   to be fair , our minorities are n't like france or germany 's minorities yeah . 
  none of your minorities won a [ nobel prize in science ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_curie ) , nor a [ fields medal ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ng%c3%b4_b%e1%ba%a3o_ch%c3%a2u ) , nor a [ fields medal ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/artur_%c3%81vila ) , nor a [ fields medal ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/maxime_kontsevitch ) , nor a [ fields medal ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandre_grothendieck ) , nor a [ fields medal ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/wendelin_werner ) . 
  someone should have told him that people are not sent back home by truck . 
  put your glasses on friend . 
  salt will fly high . 
   only europe is allowed to commit atrocities sprinkle some of that salt on muh popcorn friend . 
   britain was the first . 
  uk left because of sovereignty issues and polish romanians and bulgarians . 
   this chain of replies started with me telling people that are not affected by the refugee issue to mind their own business . 
  if having an open border with germany , they are free to leave like uk , 
   dude you just said to him that it will not affect him whatsoever yet you 're now suggesting they shut off their country from everyone else . 
  well that 's the best way to deal with irrational people and cry babies . 
  you think your country is under threat ... act like it buddy . 
  i do n't give a shit   freedom of movement was one of the greatest things the citizens of eu had for quite a while . 
  getting rid of it apparently is a fucking grade a idea . 
  well if people are so paranoid . 
  it 's their country , they 're free to put up borders . 
   i 'd imagine it would work the same way . 
  i 'd like actual proof of the procedure . 
  because in france it 's more like : yo mec , this dude ... i do n't like him ... he might be a terry , he might be too much of a leftist , he might be too mch of a neo-nazi . 
  put 'em on a list . 
  that 's why that list is 10500 names long . 
  some deserve to be there , but it 's not a justice system thing . 
  go on a wrong site and you 'll be fucked . 
   we 'd like it officially recognised so we can surveil him/her . 
  so this guy was under surveillance?where did you read that ? 
   they are just too gleeful that they can finallly go arond and shout told you so ; merkels fault !!!, 
  ; all refugees out eh . 
  after the attacks in france the critical comments were from : * serial racist : 3rd generation mosleeeeeeeeems . 
  omg !, 
  see !, 
  they 're eviiiiil . 
  kick the mosleeeeems outs . 
  * serial complainers : why do you constantly talk about the attacks in france ? 
  10000000 people died yesterday in beirut . 
  is it because it happened in a western country ? 
  is it ? 
  i 'm a child of humanity i care about all humans . 
  i am great !, 
  a murder is an act that has been committed . 
  and that would be the justice system . 
  i am asking to see who determines who 's a terrorist threat in germany . 
  who are they ? 
  name names . 
  it 's not hard . 
  if you feel that your country is under threat ... border controls !, 
  no one 's stopping you , 
   individuals classified as terror threats should be given some some `` special treatment , '' i hate to be that guy ... but who does the classification of terrorist threat ? 
  yeah . 
  let 's fly them to the moon . 
  1 / i 'm french . 
  / u/octave1 has a belgian flair and talks about `` authorities saying everything 's a-ok '' . 
  what authorities is he talking about ? 
  2 / did this guy come with the refugee stream from syria ? 
  well you complain how awful this problem is to you . 
  how severly affected you are . 
  do your homework , 
   he supposedly more developed and relaxed tunisia ? 
  http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2016/12/20/david-thomson-tunisie_n_13747056.html guy 's an expert on these issues . 
  basically tunisia ignored the rapidly developping extremism . 
   saying everyone 's benign and everything 's under control who 's saying that ? 
  are your politicians telling you that ? 
  because our politicians are n't . 
  calm down hawkey . 
  no one 's sending no one to guantanamo . 
   but these people may be helped outside europe too . 
  with less money per person helped well buddy , get your german citizenship and start voting voting voting . 
   be sure to tell us the results . 
   the problem is that nobody controls the internal borders . 
  put border controls if that bothers you then . 
  goddamn undemocratic eu !, 
   that would discrupt our economy enourmously . 
  czechia is highly dependent on exports to germany ( +30 % of gdp ) , german tourists are by far the biggest group here too then enjoy the ride , enjoy the money and stop telling germans what they should be doing . 
    not to mention the more and more xenophobic view of germans on all foreigners/immigrants . 
  when germans move in that direction , they won \u00b4 t make a distinction between east euros , muslims or afrikans . 
  they will be aggressive to all of them . 
  we might become collateral victims . 
  wow . 
  `` fuck people leaving war zones because germans might become refractary to us ! '', 
  wonderful mentality . 
  by that logic , we should kick romania , poland ee in fact out of the eu because uk got in a hissy fit . 
  tl ; dr : stop being so self-centered for a bit . 
   it 's the old british habit of exposing someone 's alleged deficiencies while ignoring their own ( it 's from 2013 , try to read the part about italian politicians and then remember the blonde chimpanzee boris johnson ) nothing to see here folks . 
  move along . 
  move along . 
   once you 're in schengen you can travel everywhere you want . 
  since you 're albania you do n't know how schengen works : http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/free_movement_of_people_within_the_schengen_area.html  ** asylum seekers in one participating country are not entitled to travel freely to another .
