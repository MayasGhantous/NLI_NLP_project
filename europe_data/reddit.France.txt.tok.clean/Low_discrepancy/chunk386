  ** they are subject to the rules set out in the dublin iii regulation on the country to which their application for asylum must be made . 
  but sadly people like / u/trax1 have no idea how the procedure works so that 's why populist statements work with them . 
  yes, 
   just like any citizen of france , england , finland , sweeden ... or germany i will help by working in my job and pay taxes . 
  vs not paying your taxes ? 
  is that legal in cr ? 
  and how much of your taxes goes to helping asylum seekers ? 
   we are part of the eu and our country is located in center of the europe , ofcourse its our issue when in germany are people with free movement , which nobody know where they are come from . 
  how many problems did you have from refugees that left germany ? 
   the way those people come to europe and the way we checked them no . 
  these people came to germany and sweden mostly ( and a few other countries but cr is ** not ** one of those ) . 
  there is no * we * . 
  your country did not do anything . 
   is responsibility of eu which means its responsibity of every country in eu . 
  so let 's go back to the original question . 
  how much of your tax money goes to helping refugees ? 
  what do you do for that ? 
   how is that relevant ? 
  i am following your logic . 
  locking up people that did n't do anything illegal , 
   protects the local population from extreme elements within refugees what about the extreme elements within the local population ? 
  we should lock up the local population too !, 
  my oh my , deep learning has made significant progress . 
  you really pass the turing test . 
   jullien ciolos ' parents are hicks that ca n't spell a french name correctly ? 
   seems the optimal solution locking people up is the ideal solution . 
  any self respecting ai would realise that sooner of later . 
   just because you allow people into the country does n't mean you need to let them roam freely . 
  [ british confirmed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_boer_war#concentration_camps_.281900.e2.80.931902.29 ), 
   you know it 's bad when an oligarch formerly connected to secret police sounds sane . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/may/11/which-eu-countries-receive-the-most-asylum-seekers you have one of the lowest asylum seekers per capita in europe . 
  he does n't sound sain , you 're just paranoid . 
   migration is problem of eu , not only problem of germany how do you , as a czech citizen plan to help ? 
   i am not his fanboy but not everything is populism and collecting votes . 
  well in this case , it is populism . 
  how are you or your country affected by refugees ? 
  https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/no-country-for-asylum-seekers-why-they-shun-czech-rep/r~i:article:776816/?redirected=1482317084 czech republic has ** one of the lowest ** asylum applications ** per capita ** in europe . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_seekers_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states , _ 2014_and_2015 _ ( thousands_of_first_time_applicants ) _ yb16.png stop pretending it 's a huge problem that affects you , it is not . 
  i ca n't even see you on the chart in global numbers . 
  heck i bet even france has way higher numbers than czech rrep , yet by and large refugees are not a problem in france . 
  now chill and let people that are actually affected by this issue , deal with it . 
   no sketchy looking middle eastern men , no african male groups that looks like thugs . 
  did you have slavic men in leather jackets and low cut hairdos ( or even worse tracksuits ) ? 
  those people also freak me out . 
  [ wan na hear a joke ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ombwwqcenw ), 
  my condolences !, 
  what language is that ? 
  go my child , claim those lands . 
   it is not the company management deciding to put the eastern european trucks last - it is the employees . 
  have you ever worked in a western company man ? 
  because that 's nonsense . 
  they know when shipment arrives . 
  and no , low level workers do n't try to fuck eastern europeans at every turn . 
  yeah what part confuses you . 
  `` i ca n't wait for x '' means `` i really want x '' . 
  `` it does n't mean berliner ca n't wait for x '' means `` it does n't mean berliners really want x '' . 
  i was replying to this :  maybe because you do n't want to get your ass kicked by random people just because you are n't white ? 
  i really can not understand what part you do not get ... what 's your reading comprehension level ? 
   you are right i should have said because he was brown uhm what do you call beating people ** just because they 're brown ** ? 
   ass kicked by random people just because you are n't white ? 
  what do you call beating people ** just because they are n't white ** ? 
   broadly claiming that berliners as a whole are racists - as you did - makes you a first rate asshole . 
  can you read ? 
  do you know how to read ? 
  reread what was written !, 
  read . 
  it 's not hard , 
   the company is required to spend as little as possible so hires polish/romanian/bulgarian lorry , but at the same time people do not like the fact that competitive carriers are growing and thus make it harder for them . 
  it costs money to not receive the goods asap . 
  it means that the workers in the company that ordered do not work . 
  why would a company waste money just to fuck with people ? 
  and do n't say xenophobia because that reason is bullshit . 
  i would know . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jcdee/lkwattacke_in_berlin_verd%c3%a4chtiger_soll_23j%c3%a4hriger/dbf3x7v/ it says that he was n't allowed to unload until 8 pm . 
  which might actually be a restriction ( i do n't know how these things work in germany ) . 
   as a native berliner : after a night like this it surely feels great to get your support . 
  if you had family , friends that were killed or hurt in last night 's attack , maybe it is not a good moment to be on the internet . 
  i suggest you read what i actually wrote ( it 's not what you believe i wrote ) . 
  * please stop reading here * . 
  if you have n't actually been affected by the attacks , man the fuck up . 
  you do n't need any support , you cry baby . 
  85 people got run over 200 m from where i live ... who gives a shit . 
  other than a stained street and an area blocked for a few days , my life was just the same . 
  it 's the people that actually have had deaths that need support , not you . 
  also , learn to read . 
   ass kicked by random people just because you are n't white ? 
  what do you call beating people ** just because they are n't white ** ? 
   of course you run if a mob thinks you are the guy was he chased by a mob ? 
  did other brown people get beaten ? 
   try to lower their throughput and morale with discriminative and humilating practices . 
  & nbsp ;  from what i read here and there , it happens in warehouses and factories . 
  so a company or a factory hires a polish lorry ( when they can hire french or germans ) to deliver them goods , but will make it such that they receive the goods later all in order to spite the polish ? 
  that does not make ** any ** sense to me . 
  i 'll have to wait till an actual article explains what happened or explains the current situation . 
   also , the truck was rejected and then parked at the outskirts of berlin , not in the centre of it where the attack took it 's place . 
  ah so it was supposed to deliver stuff in the outskirts of berlin . 
  how the hell did the terrorist manage to drive a lorry from the outskirts to the center without alarming people ? 
   so how are the french trucks allowed in france and german in germany at the time of polish trucks rejection ? 
  the article clearly states that polish , romanian and bulgarian drivers are always thrown to the end of the queue of native ones ?
