  this is how far we 've become . 
  europe is not canada . 
  we are not surrounded by cold oceans . 
  edit : we 're more similar to the us ... bordering poor regions . 
  how many illegals does the us have ? 
   post the recording not an article that i ca n't even read a google translate . 
  and it 's evidence for the court buddy . 
  maybe you should google how a proper justice system works because living in turkey has skewed your opinion . 
   isis would look like puppies near the original pkk . 
  did turkey torture her ? 
   nice conspiracy theory . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2015/08/13/assassinat-de-trois-militantes-kurdes-a-paris-le-suspect-renvoye-aux-assises_4724149_3214.html the guy had numerous made numerous visits to turkey and there was a voice recording between him and two agents of mit . 
  also there was a project to help him escape with the help of an mit agent . 
   also since when being a co-founder of a terrorist organization makes you an activist ? 
  once you start torturing the accused , you any right to claim you are better . 
  do it right once , and you never have to do it again !, 
   these people would have a group behind them , family and friends who knew what was going to happen but stayed quiet and even covered for them . 
  one of the main organisers of the paris attacks and thalys train attack was caught because a woman called the police http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/attentats-de-paris-la-vie-du-temoin-qui-a-balance-abaaoud-est-elle-en-danger_1760499.html, 
   there 's no way any type of screening would prevent underlying thoughts from progressing over years/months/weeks that could lead to a similar situation given the correct circumstances go ask people who actually are in charge of your nuclear arms program , see how it works , 
  any policeman with a gun can come close to any diplomat in your country ? 
  it 's a very small number of people that carry out these acts . 
   invest in renewable energy . 
  that 's not what car companies do , though . 
   to try to force car companies to pay fines for what ? 
  hey . 
  lagarde got convicted because of negligence ( but no fine or anything ) . 
   i 'm saying people seem to be pretty `` meh '' about it , and that surprises me . 
  not sure what you 're expecting ? 
  paris mayor said she 'll work to ban diesel [ inside of the city by 2025 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/four-of-worlds-biggest-cities-to-ban-diesel-cars-from-their-centres ) cars made before 97 are no longer allowed to circulate between [ 8 am - 8 pm ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/pollution/article/2016/07/01/tout-comprendre-a-l-interdiction-des-vehicules-polluants-a-paris_4961651_1652666.html ) renault said they 're thinking of [ stopping producing diesel in the most popular cars because of regulations ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37287129 ) can you be more precise on what you 're expecting ? 
   a few germans were talking about feeling safe in their christmasmarkets . 
  i walk everyday on a promenade where 85 people got run over just 5 months ago . 
  i have n't thought about the attack in 2-3 weeks at least . 
  people move on . 
   so he probably just got in with his police badge because russian ambassador do n't use guards . 
  when i mean pratically was his bodyguard , i mean that he was the only person with a gun anywhere close to him . 
  the guy made a 1min speech after shooting the ambassador . 
  wtf ? 
   he donned a suite and flashed his standard police badge around to pretend to be a part of the protective detail . 
  that 's why in a normal country you have security clearances . 
  and even though you 're a cop , because you have n't been cleared to be having a gun close to the guy , you wo n't be able to do that . 
  someone was an extreme amateur in this situation . 
   the eu propaganda machine buys a lot . 
  i kinda think the agro and car lobby are behind this . 
   what i do n't get is the lack of outrage about this by the population in europe . 
  is there any outrage in the us because of climate change ? 
  sure there is a bit ... but then you voted a guy that thinks it 's a chinese hoax . 
  people are n't protesting because well ... it 's difficult to protest against your own car . 
  companies are switching from diesel so it 'll take time . 
   yeah , but from the transcript he seemed more moderate than most . 
  yeah . 
  clearly he was very moderate . 
   yeah buddy , clearly reddit turks are the reason for that . 
  so it 's not the fault of turkish people ? 
  who else then ? 
   yes ... remember how the first world war started ? 
  til that the ambassador to turkey was the next russian president . 
   abdulkadir selvi ( pro-goverment journalist ) said he had al-nusra links.and he could be a islamist who is in the police force ( thanks erdo\u011fan ) . 
  and he was basically the bodyguard at that moment , since no other person seems to be around the ambassador ... holy crap what incompetent people /, 
  in any normal country , he would n't have passed the screened even in such a scenario . 
   my guess is that he had family or friends in syria that were killed by russian/syrian troops . 
  usually bodyguards are screened for stuff like this . 
   was shot while at an art exhibition considering how shitty this new art is , the shooting was probably part of the exhibition . 
  kinda hard to feel sorry for the dick that brands a whole nation as racist even though they bothered to actually house tens of thousands of their friends . 
   more sensible to climate changes and the gulf stream . 
  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-simulations-question-gulf-stream-role-tempering-europes-winters/ the gulf stream might not be that important . 
  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-simulations-question-gulf-stream-role-tempering-europes-winters/ meh . 
   1981 - 1996 . may 1995, 
   it 's very common here and part of our tradition . 
  think in france it 's illegal to buy live pigs so you can slaughter them yourself . 
   we have a special police force , nas , the pigs are protected by ... the pigs . 
   the importance became clear only after french and belgian citizens started buying these defunct firearms . 
  and how did you think they found out ? 
  criminals and people in general are n't stupid . 
  they know which countries have lax laws . 
  you must either be na\u00efve or have ill intent to think it only happened the few times these guns already surfaced . 
   mr. gajdos said that before the slovak gun laws changed in july , afg sold decommissioned weapons to individuals in `` many countries in the eu , including belgium . '' & nbsp ;  prior to that thousands were sold over the years to slovak citizens with no issues whatsoever . 
  do you know of all the gun caches that are in europe ? 
   would you go through 10 months of national legislation process at a moment when higher legislator says he will do so , and when you would need to redo your own process once the higher rules are known ? 
  if it is a matter of extreme importance ** yes ** . 
  legal voids are ** extremely ** dangerous . 
  case in point ... 
   btw slovakia changed the law after paris attacks fucking finally . 
   as they did n't want to do it twice an waiting for the commission to do so ( even though they knew their rules were inefficient ) yeah . 
  that inefficiency resulted in dead people . 
  but why do your job as a lawmaker when pushing the blame on the eu is much much easier . 
  there 's no political risk in doing nothing . 
  omg , how could i be so stupid . 
  of course it 's the eu 's fault . 
  always is :d . stupid me, 
  that 's some breaking news . 
  the shop was legal, 
  were n't some of the guns used in terrorist attacks obtained from slovakia ? 
  i think arms can be obtained fairly easy in many parts of eastern europe ... as we can see during the recent french terrorist attacks . 
  if we could manage the problems we have now it would be nice , rather than focusing on making things bigger and bigger . 
  you must be quite powerless irl since you need to pretend you 're the absolute ruler of uk or something . 
  quite sad . 
  quite sad indeed . 
  art 7 . 
   he tried to shoot down a civilian plane and say multiple time that he will do it again . 
  the guy 's fucking old .
