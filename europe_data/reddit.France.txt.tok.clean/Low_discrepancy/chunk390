  we beat germany and uk to gay civil unions and gay marriage . 
  suck it ( after you put a ring on my finger of course ), 
  spoilt food = people who no like putin . 
  \\ #putinmasterrace, 
   why does it have to be one or the other ? 
  less electricity on heating . 
   second of all the toddler would shit in a potty like all others and how do you clean said baby ? 
   you seriously have no arguments , just because you think it 's better it does n't mean it is . 
  yeah running water is n't better . 
  * facepalm * bye troll . 
   the meat industry , from farms to processing , is the one of the main contributing factor to carbon and methane emissions if by one of the main factors you mean the [ * 4th * largest polluter ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_economic_activity,_eu-28,_2008_and_2013_\\ ( % c2 % b9 \\ ) _ \\ ( % 25_of_total_emissions_in_co2_equivalents \\ ) _ yb16.png ) , yeah okay . 
  the same pattern is in the us where agriculture is also responsible for only 10 % of co2 emissions . 
  electricity or manufacturing ... them be the big ones . 
  instead of eating less meat , people should move to the south . 
  yup . 
  great sitcom , a must see, 
   man , i am not talking about the elected persons , but about the appointed ones which are mostly trash with no real qualifications . 
  you 're arguing that mitrea , a former union worker does not have qualifications for politics ? 
  or what ? 
  so he 's corrupt . 
  that sucks but in what way was he not qualified beforehand of the position he occupied ? 
  since he was a senator , that means he was elected too . 
  people do n't have a magical crystal ball to see who will end up corrupt and who will not . 
   and others would n't pay for not needed things . 
  so a young mother raising a toddler does not running water and they can very well shit in the back yard . 
  are you for real ? 
   mitrea engineer that graduated from bucharest polytechnic and worked as an engineer at a bus depot . 
  he was also a unionist . 
  wtf are you bitching about ? 
  this guy that got 4.5 % at the first round of the french presidential elections in 2002 is an actual post office worker https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivier_besancenot he delivers mail . 
   i 'd like a professional , someone with a strong background well ciolos is an agro engineer . 
  basescu is a former ship captain on the largest [ oil tanker ] ( http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/mrimage/2015/05/08/554cb4a8cfbe376e35fbb4e1/646x404.jpg ) romania had . 
  dragnea graduated from bucharest polytechnic , iliescu was a geotechnical engineer , nastase and ponta were lawyers . 
  seems to me you do have people with strong technical backgrounds . 
   the state collected more wage contribution after they implemented flat tax . 
  i 'd like a source for that . 
  meanwhile other articles show that they increased inequality http://wiiw.ac.at/the-impact-of-the-flat-tax-reform-on-inequality-the-case-of-romania-dlp-3217.pdf  also did u know at that time they where taxing everything above around 500 dollars ( we did n't have the euro then ) salaries with 45 % tax ? 
  and ? 
  the average salary in romania was 250 dollars in 2004 when psd lost to pd-pnl http://www.pensiiprahova.ro/salariile-medii-lunare-pe-economie-utilizate-la-calculul-pensiei/ http://www.cursv.ro/bnr/2004-11-01/,

  \\ #notallfrenchimfdirectors, 
  let 's see . 
  romanian pm 96-98 ciorbea pntcd https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/victor_ciorbea romanian pm 98-99 vasile pntcd https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/radu_vasile romanian president 96-00 emil constantinescu from cdr ( pntcd + pd ) seems * preeetty * close to me . 
   platforms mean nothing in romania is just populist overbid . 
  t well it does matter . 
  http://www.evz.ro/psd-ia-in-calcul-schimbarea-cotei-unice.html http://www.evz.ro/pnl-ar-da-cota-unica-pe-paritatea-cu-psd-918821.html one party wants flat tax rate , the other does n't . 
  that 's a reality . 
  politics ** is ** being done in romania . 
   the only reason some of us endorsed pnl was because they were backing up ciolos romania has a hard-on for technocratic govts . 
  for romanians that 's the best thing since sliced bread . 
  well reality does n't work like that . 
  politics should rule a country not a technocracy . 
  would you be happy with a govt made out of people from petrom , renault , bcr-gsg , rosia montana gold corporation ? 
  maybe you would , but the vast majority of people obviously wouldnt . 
   misplaced belief that their in it for anything else but the votes politicians want votes : o. 
  what vile people they are . 
  gah they disgust me . 
   do you really think psd will remove flat tax http://www.evz.ro/psd-ia-in-calcul-schimbarea-cotei-unice.html http://www.evz.ro/pnl-ar-da-cota-unica-pe-paritatea-cu-psd-918821.html, 
   they had an alternative : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democratic_national_peasants'_party pntcd had their chance in 96-00 and blew it amazingly . 
  see that huge inflation peak of 170 % in 96-97 ? 
   using their manifesto , which is laughably naive and the whole water thing . 
  yes . 
  i follow politics by looking at everybody 's manifesto . 
  that 's how voting is done . 
  is that a surprise ? 
  i compared the project of pnl to psd the two biggest parties and like it or not , politically they are different . 
   do n't you get that we need infrastructure then raise taxes . 
  tax tax tax tax . 
  who 's doing that ? 
  seems like pnl reduces all taxes , while psd reduces them for pensioners and poor people , not great when you have flat tax rate , but better than pnl . 
   they give you money now , so you forget how they steal from you later . 
  well it 's better than parties that never bother giving you any money , is n't it ? 
  flat tax rate is money for the rich . 
  the office . 
   it sounds harsh to call so many people uneducated , but it 's simply reality , and the first step in solving a problem is acknowledging it . 
  all sides seem profoundly uneducated to me . 
   it might seem surprising to you that when you have a well ... well , you do n't really need any extra water . 
   ) i 'd rather not store my water in buckets and have to shit in the outhouse . 
  the communist system is directly responsible for them . 
  and after communism , the only political party that even bothered to mention 50 % of the romanian population were psd . 
  like it or not , it 's reality . 
  go to / r/romania and tell me how psd voters are considered : * wife beaters * rednecks * idiots that ca n't be bothered to bathe * drunkards that 's the idea romania has of a country ? 
  37 % do n't have fucking running water man . 
  running water . 
  these are treated like `` idiots '' . 
  if i would n't have running water , i 'd vote for le pen 's racist anti-semitic , xenophobe uncle to get it . 
   when that tax was implemented the gains from wage taxes they rose for whom ? 
    your economy becomes mature one can go on taxing income discrepancies . 
  so that 's why poland for example does n't have a flat income tax ? 
  pretty sure poland is kicking romania 's ass . 
  you ca n't even pay your docs because you have a flat tax rate and well the budget suffers because . 
  stop worrying about capital consolidation , this is income tax . 
  you claim there is no debate on ideas and i 'm calling bullshit . 
  you also claim that hurr durr people be stoppid and no read campaign promises . 
  and that nothing matters they 're all corrupt . 
  well ... no .
