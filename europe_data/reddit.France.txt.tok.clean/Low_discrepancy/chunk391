  and what 's different from 20012-2015 when psd had a pm ? 
  surely people do n't think that pnl kept psd in check . 
   i 'm sure more than 1 % of psd voters actually took into consideration tax laws i would most definitely . 
  when they increased pensions , the central bank was talking about a catastrophe : http://www.digi24.ro/opinii/seful-consiliului-fiscal-cresterea-pensiilor-e-catastrofica-efortul-va-fi-de-23-de-miliarde-de-lei-pe-an-608101 well turns out , when you have a flat tax , you have a small budget and not a ton of free range ... 
  kill the flat tax , let the poor breathe a little . 
  start creating an actual left wing party if this one bothers you ... 
   no , idiots who fell for populism did . 
  what idiots ? 
  * [ 37 % of romanians do n't have running water ] ( http://www.mediafax.ro/life-inedit/romania-tara-unde-internetul-este-mai-accesibil-decat-apa-curenta-15332767 ) * [ 28 % of romanians work in agriculture and they make 4 times less than those working in computer science . 
  ] ( http://www.zf.ro/profesii/evolutia-salariului-mediu-net-pe-economie-in-principalele-industrii-romanesti-13052574 ) * 45 % of romanians are rurals and since romania is drastically affected by doctors fleeing , it 's the rural regions that see that suffer the most . 
  [ urban areas have twice as many doctors even though they have about the same population ] ( http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/serviciile-medicale-sanatatea-populatieiprecare-mediul-rural-1_55817133cfbe376e3560f410/index.html ) which has a signficant impact , infant mortality which is the highest in the eu is much higher in [ rural areas than urban ] ( http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/document-2013-10-9-15765618-0-mortalitan2012-2013.pdf ) ( about 50 % higher i 'd say ... pdf ) so yeah which one of those idiots man , i 'm curious . 
   it 's not like one side was for gay rights and clean energy and hatespeech laws and the other for low taxes , gun rights and whatever else . 
  one side if for flat tax , simplified tax system , that vastly favours the rich , the other wants higher pensions and minimum wage ... yeah dude , it is about views . 
  pnl or usr might not have been perfect but anything is better than this travesty . 
  the people that put in place the flat income tax ? 
  if you make 1 million euros , or 100 euros ... you pay the same 16 % ... smaaaart move . 
  surely the poor benefit greatly from this . 
  other parties were proposing more than the usual : lower taxes for everybody ... yeeey !, 
  i make minimum wage , i already pay a pittance in taxes meanwhile rich people get gifts handed to them ... yeeey !, 
   looks like we just elected someone who committed voting fraud . 
  anymore than cameron was elected ... he was not . 
  it 's a parlamentary election . 
   is that not 2016 enough for you ? 
  electoral fraud is a serious issue . 
  but it 's not exactly a unique thing in romania or europe for that matter . 
  we had a former president that was [ convicted to jail for fraud ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2011/12/15/verdict-attendu-dans-l-affaire-des-emplois-fictifs-de-la-ville-de-paris_1618652_3224.html ) and we still kinda think fondly of him . 
  dragnea 's declarations though are serious and he should n't become pm . 
  then take it from the horse 's mouth : http://pnl.ro/despre-noi/angajamentul-nostru/programul-de-guvernare it 's a copy paste of their major points . 
  i get it that you love right wing govts but hey get used to the new reality man . 
   that 16 % income tax might not last too long . 
  poor people want some scraps on the table too . 
   do n't be fooled by the name , there 's no such thing as a left-right scale for parties in romania . 
  just corrupt and slightly less corrupt . 
  * they had the steepest increases of minimum wage in [ romania ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=ml9s8a132hlg_&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;idim=country:ro:bg:hu&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:ro&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) in the past 17 years...2011-2015 period ( though they also ruled between 00-04 . 
  * they were discussing on [ removing the flat income tax rate ] ( http://www.gandul.info/financiar/guvernul-vrea-sa-renunte-la-cota-unica-impozitare-progresiva-de-pana-la-35-13550677 ) , which favors the rich and screws the poor and was introduced by a right wing govt some 10 years ago . 
  and a special increase for old timers that worked in communist style farms ... wow ... those are the people that get the lowest pensions in romania nowadays ... good job . 
  meanwhile lets look at the [ campaign promises ] ( http://www.romaniatv.net/alegeri-parlamentare-2016--ce-promisiuni-electorale-fac-partidele-politice_327377.html ) : psd : * increasing minimum wage * increasing pensions * special tax abattements for farmers ( very helpful considering that 45 % of romanians are rurals and 37 % of romanians do n't even have running water ... the vast majortity of those being rurals , 28 % of romanians are working in agriculture ) * 75 % of utilities will be guaranteed by the govt for the poorest people . 
  * tax abattement for people with low pensions * 18 % vat meanwhile pnl , the major right wing party : * 50 % reduction on all taxes * tax abattement for all pensions * 16 % vat tax and in general full stream on this tax * some fund to help rural development ... but since it 's a fund , you most likely have to make a project , which poor farmers making a day by day living ca n't really do . 
  all in all , one seems like a left wing , the other a right wing . 
  in their promises ... * but also * in how they governed . 
   post-communist cronyism is not the same as being left wing . 
  how about debating the actual topics and not shifting the goalpost ? 
  we 're talking about romania . 
   i 'm more of a leftist , and i agree with this , but as far as i know , no member of the eu from the former warsaw pact has this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates well a few countries have the income tax rate in a range , except romania . 
  so why go with parties that have such a huge boner for it ( pnl wo n't admit to being wrong about smth they introduced ... and for rich people it 's heaven ) . 
  how about having debates on actual political programs . 
  at some point , you people should start doing actual politics and not emotional voting . 
  a left wing and a right wing party will have to exist , no matter how much you dislike it one or the other . 
   believing impossible things ( repeatably ) is no exactly a sign of rational thought . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  romania has single taxation rates at 16 % . 
  that 's killing the budget . 
  psd is the only major party talking about stopping this stupid procedure . 
  will they do it or not ? 
  who knows but they 're the only major party talking about this . 
  like it or not , they 're a geniunly left wing party ... about the only one in romania . 
   you do n't win the rural vote with good policies , you win it with promises of pension/salary raises when people live in such abject poverty ... yeah it matters . 
  and heck even in france , the most left wing parties want to increase minimum wage ( which is at 1200 euros ... give or take ) while the fiscal conservatives/business types want to see it reduced . 
  like it or not , the left wing party in france did help increase some benefits here and there . 
  and for people living in poverty , it matters . 
   so much so as to waste your time arguing against the reddit hivemind . 
  because a debate is to be had and on / r/europe it 's possible . 
  it 's not t_d, 
   also please stop talking about the campaign promises , because in romania they are completely irrelevant . 
  uhm ... did n't i show how one is ? 
  the increase of minimum wage . 
  http://www.digi24.ro/opinii/seful-consiliului-fiscal-cresterea-pensiilor-e-catastrofica-efortul-va-fi-de-23-de-miliarde-de-lei-pe-an-608101 besides the doom and gloom , the pensions were increased . 
   that is probably the only good thing he did , but at the end of the day it makes sense , he wanted to become president , so he just did the easiest thing he could do to bring him votes , increase the minimum wage and reduce the vat how about instead of having one tax rate that fucks the poor , how about you put in progressive taxation ? 
  that would increase the budget and shut up the pencil pushers that bitch about omg the buuuuudget . 
  http://www.gandul.info/financiar/guvernul-vrea-sa-renunte-la-cota-unica-impozitare-progresiva-de-pana-la-35-13550677 oh look psd was thinking of removing it ( though things have changed since ) . 
  but i guess it 's easier to talk about corruption and local barons than an actual friggin debate about what 's killing rural romania . 
   the government does not make laws who suggested the budget ? 
   i think the state should increase investments , even if it means taking on some loans , as our foreign debt is under 40 % of gdp , quite comfortable . 
  okay . 
  austerity except for when helping companies . 
  :p  with a fixed budget , you need to make some choices . 
  so i favor the long term solution rather than the short term approach of increasing benefits and doing the same old thing . 
  well what party actually wanted to do all of that ? 
  and how would a small farmer that has 5 ha in the middle of nowhere benefit from better irrigation equipment ? 
  romania is too parcelled to do much advances . 
  any type of such thing would benefit the rich , large land owners . 
  which might not be a bad thing ... who knows ... 
  it 's not my area of speciality . 
  it 's always a difficult choice . 
  http://www.digi24.ro/opinii/seful-consiliului-fiscal-cresterea-pensiilor-e-catastrofica-efortul-va-fi-de-23-de-miliarde-de-lei-pe-an-608101 but heck you ca n't always say fuck the poor , let europe have them . 
   or whatever other metric you want . 
  https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=ml9s8a132hlg_&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;idim=country:ro:bg:hu&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:ro&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false looking at the data , it seems that the highest minimum wage increases happened during ponta . 
   the truth is that time will again show that psd are a bunch of pieces of shit not saying magic will happen . 
  but just look at what everyone suggests . 
  the same tax rate for everybody is killing the poor people , fuck that . 
  that way too low minimum wage is killing people . 
  reducing taxes for everybody is shit for poor people . 
  it 's time to think of those people too . 
   but i am not blaming the poor people for their votes not saying that you are . 
  but the narrative from the well-to-do romanians ( those on reddit , i doubt from the shittier parts of the country ) is how awful and stupid and dumb the people who voted for psd are . 
  huh til . 
  they have interesting projects ( connecting moldova to the transportation grid ) but seem kinda light on poor and rural people . 
  we 'll see , good luck . 
   according to the imf the deficit for 2017 is projected to be 3.5 % of gdp with a ciolos govt , right ? 
   it could .
