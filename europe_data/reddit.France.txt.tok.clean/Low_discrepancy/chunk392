  vat tax reduction , 50 % tax reduction across the board etc wo n't reduce the state budget ? 
   psd 's economic practices made it a whole lot worse for romania , then we got the right-ish to implement imf-imposed austerity in order to weather out the crisis so you favor austerity . 
  tell me more how you 'd not dream to have a merkel or fillon run govt ? 
  that 's fine , more power to you . 
  but different people have different needs . 
  and considering how poor some romanians are , how extremely poor ... telling them to suck it up and have everybody at the same tax rate ... you 're really fucking the poor , man . 
  i like how you present deep arguments that do not dare beyond : oh they 're all corrupt , fuck 'em . 
  my guys are the good guys . 
   also , do i need to remind you that romania had the highest economic growth in the eu this year ? 
  just this , by itself , is a remarkable achievement . 
  ** exactly ** . 
  how was that growth shared between the rural and the urban ? 
  i wan na see some stats on that . 
  or show me where in his program he plans on tackling this issue . 
  how does he plan to take on the problem of docs and teachers living the country side for the eu ? 
  how does he plan to increase development ? 
   i am involved in a telemedicine startup that ( we hope ) will help a lot with this issue , if we do n't go bankrupt  so i can 100 % see why a right wing , fiscal conservative , pro-business govt is extremely appealing to you . 
  but surely , you can understand why a poor schmuch living in bumfuck vaslui making probably 70 % of minimum wage , with a parent that barely makes the minimum pension is inclined to voted psd . 
  and that inclination is not solely due to what the priest said and the kilo of flour they got . 
  i mean c'mon ... people are n't brain dead zombies with only the young urbanites that really understand what 's going on !, 
  look at the programs : http://www.romaniatv.net/alegeri-parlamentare-2016--ce-promisiuni-electorale-fac-partidele-politice_327377.html pnl proposes lower taxes for everybody ( which is actually better for the rich ) , psd wants to increase minimum wage . 
  read the program with a mentality of someone on minimum wage in romania and tell me what you think . 
  if you people would be in france or uk . 
  fillon , thatcher , cameron would be your friggin idols . 
  and that 's telling . 
   burden on the budget and cause non-compliance with eu deficit rules . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/romania/government-budget the budget deficit is 0.7 % . 
  very low . 
  considering that the gdp is projected to increase , they have quite a bit of wiggle room . 
  and pnl 's proposal to reduce taxes by 50 % will not hurt the budget ? 
   not to mention crash the economy within a few years and cause going back to austerity , which would hurt the poor the most . 
  am i talking to fillon ? 
  on reddit ? 
  you have right wing , fiscal conservative views . 
  good for you . 
  but surely you can see why poor people do not share your views , right ? 
  37,5 % do n't have access to running water . 
  that 's quite close to the 45 % that are rurals ... also i highly suspect that the huge amounts of docs that leave romania come from the country side ( or were meant to go to the country side ) . 
  like it or not , a certain class of people are getting fucked but they have one great equaliser , the vote, 
  why not look at psd 's and pnl 's program : http://www.romaniatv.net/alegeri-parlamentare-2016--ce-promisiuni-electorale-fac-partidele-politice_327377.html with the mentality that you are living on minimum wage in romania ? 
  which would you more likely vote ? 
   we will never gon na have a pm like that technocrats , that man was the real mvp , i 'm gon na go drunk and cry a little what successes did ciolos have during his term in terms of reducing the rural/urban divide which is * extremely * large in romania ? 
   i do no such thing . 
  / u/nothrowaway4me is the butthurt one . 
   i agree with what you say about the existing issues , but have no idea how psd is supposed to help those people http://www.romaniatv.net/alegeri-parlamentare-2016--ce-promisiuni-electorale-fac-partidele-politice_327377.html let 's look at their promisses . 
  like it or not , between pnl and psd , psd seems clearly like the one that targets the poorest of the poor : * increase minimum wage * if small pensions : no more income taxation , * increasing pensions * no more taxation of farm land * 75 % of rent and utilities will be paid by the govt pnl has a general system : * 50 % reduction of taxes for everybody , * same tax rate for everybody , * creation of a fund to help develop the rural world ( because [ anca and petrica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae51upr2u70 ) have the capabilities to start projects and ask for money when they can barely live from day to day ) . 
  besides the corruption , priests saying how to vote and other bs , the programs are clearly different . 
  tl ; dr : poor people will vote programs that favor poor people . 
  news at 11, 
   their interests are aligned with keeping those people in the conditions they currently find themselves in . 
  fine . 
  start a party and start campagning to those people instead getting butthurt and calling the voters stupid . 
  why not bother educating those people , why not make those people profit from that gdp growth romania has ? 
  https://www.realitatea.net/cifre-soc-despre-accesul-la-apa-in-romania-8-650-000-de-locuitori-nu-au-apa-curenta-in-locuinta_1703378.html ** 8.5 million ** romanians do n't have access to fucking running water . 
  but hey ... high speed internet amirite ? 
   or for the ones who practically bribed them with flour , sugar and vegetable oil . 
  that 's what happens when the benefits always go to some people and not others . 
  if people in rural romania ( who make up 45 % of the population , about the second highest rate in the eu ) were n't so poor they would n't have to be bribed with some flour and sugar . 
  people who do n't agree with my views are the absolute worst and so stupid !, 
  45 % of romanians are rurals ** 30 % ** are working in agriculture . 
  meanwhile ~ ~ fence ~ ~ france , a major agricultural producer ... only 3 % . 
  romania has in total 3 times more people working in agriculture than france . 
  sure sure local barons , corruption etc etc. 
  psd is bad , awful etc. 
  but maybe it 's time to understand why psd still wins votes . 
   fbi could n't contain the situation any longer and had to reopen the case . 
  and what did the find ? 
  a big nothing ? 
  green at your faucets . 
  because apparently that 's not obvious from context . 
   i did n't make the `` red = bad '' association at all , just higher , as it is often used in density maps . 
  google colour signification . 
  http://www.color-wheel-pro.com/pics/gsinfographic1 ( color ) large.jpg a green red combination is a go-stop safety association . 
  a safety-danger association . 
   but the whole place needs to run to conform to your perspective because it 's the natural one . 
  just because you do n't know something , does n't mean others do n't . 
  if you associate red with high density , then you use a heat map and the opposite would be blue . 
  go check your faucets . 
   it 's a heat map , the higher the density the warmer the color . 
  so red hot , green cold ? 
  do you have greed at your faucets ? 
  wow . 
  that 's so nuts . 
  amazing video, 
  so that 's where slough is . 
  never bothered googling it . 
  and swindon, 
  if it was intuitive everybody would be doing it . '', 
  any fool can complicate things ; it takes a genius to simplify them '' woody guthrie, 
   someone else can interpret it as cool/hot green being hot or cool ? 
  if you use a heat map , then you pick blue - red . 
   color coding of charts is inherently arbitrary and that 's the reason legends exist . 
  you 're probably the type of person that does n't understand why apple is succesful . 
  good design is intuitive . 
  and intuition should be the main drive when designing something . 
  there 's a reason why there 's a very popular sub called / r/dataisbeautiful, 
   red is used for higher numbers/density usually . 
  then blue should be used and not green . 
  poor design is poor . 
  and ireland and malta and cyprus .
