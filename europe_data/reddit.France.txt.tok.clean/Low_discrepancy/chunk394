  i 'm confused on what your train of thought is, 
   more people have died thanks to the response to the introduction of the naval taxi service and it 's this attitude to shout down discussion by branding it far right/racist that is getting people killed . 
  dude stop complaining . 
  it was germany that pushed for the deal with turkey to stop the refugee flow . 
  germany said they 'd accept those refugees already in europe not all syrian refugees . 
  and concerning libya , need i remind you what countries are responsible for the fall of the libyan state ? 
  france is one . 
  can you name the other ? 
   i merely explained why some people will still feel this is a political trial . 
  and some people feel that climate change is a hoax by the chinese and that obama was born on the moon or something . 
  some people have jumped off the deep end , what can we do ? 
   for his international fans . 
  who would those people be ? 
   i dont think anyone who follows wilders identifies as a part of an american neo nazi internet movement . 
  i dunno what / u/10ebbor10 wrote , but clearly wilders is appealing to american/english speaking idiots . 
  he wrote his tweet in english ... 
   i think he does and i actually think there will be people who will see him now as someone unjustly condemned by outoftouch judges . 
  so judges should bend their ruling based on politics ? 
  one question : * are you out of your mind ? 
   though geert is already on the attack unsurprisingly as you can see on his twitter : https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/807175994809401344 so now dutch politicians communicate with their electorate in english tweets ? 
  where is proof ? 
  show proof !, 
  no proof , west lies, 
   uk to migrants and instead to spend large sums of money supporting foreign aid so yes seems like you give about the same amount as germany . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_development_aid_country_donors and when you factor in how much germany helps people also at home , that really dwarfs whatever uk is doing . 
   to paraphrase , you do not fix a leaking pipe by just collecting all the water that 's leaked out . 
  people is n't water . 
  anyone who sets foot on european soil / waters has to be properly treated . 
  gday . 
   but the consequences have to be divided by the whole eu . 
  yeah . 
  it 's the eu . 
  a community of countries . 
   supermarkets ' sales tax we do n't have sales tax but vat tax . 
  and i have no idea what you mean . 
  vat is 20 % ... what ? 
  gchq spying on americans ? 
  yeah sure ... 
   i would actually be fine with freedom of movement of people who work freedom of movement for those seeking work , surely you mean . 
  there never was a forceful quota . 
  just maybe tying up the eu budget with how willing countries are to give a hand . 
   they are your responsibility now . 
  yeah . 
  i highly doubt many go to poland either . 
  get outta ` ere with your international law . 
  feelz know no international law . 
  here in europe we wan na live in the days before we used to respect international law . 
  those were the good times . 
   why do you insist on allowing them to try to float on dangerous boats in the sea ? 
  what a generous soul you are :'( . 
  i did n't know you cared so much for them . 
  so are you going to go build houses in africa ? 
   allowance of 11.45 euros a day or 343.50 euros that 's 1/3rd if the minimum wage . 
  it 's peanuts . 
   we could help 3 or 4 ppl in syria for the same amount . 
  in poland you do help 3,4 people for the same amount . 
  so poland can take them . 
  access to transport ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  housing ? 
  do you wan na live in containers or youth hostel like conditions ? 
   can not take the entire third world and let them live on benefits edit : you are an especially ignorant person . 
  an asylum seeker gets about 300 euros per month in france . 
  that 's nothing . 
  stop getting your info from extreme right propaganda . 
  seems that the concept is copied from another dude http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/16/technology/youtube-fast-food-reviewer/, 
  write me on the 8th of may because i 'm done with it . 
   that question is beyond being informed and no amount of education can tell you that . 
  let me rephrase that : while voting , being informed does not help you make a better decision . 
   i am very educated and voted leave i just ate , so there is no global hunger !, 
  did you really just say that ? 
  do you understand the purpose of statistics vs anecdotes ? 
  this discussion is going nowhere because i can not not suspect you of intellectual dishonesty . 
  no one should ** ever ** ** ever ** say that voting goes beyond being informed . 
  you are using personal bias to discredit any effort of creating informed voters , your personal bias to affirm that a better educated mass of people does not create better voters , etc. 
  cheers, 
   just as it was unthinkable that britain should vote to leave the eu and unthinkable that the us would elect donald trump . '', 
  i stopped bothering , really . 
  * french person ( even friggin extreme right wingers ) : they wo n't win . 
  they lost at the regional elections even though it was after a terrorist attack . 
  fillon is sucking them dry and he managed to achieve exceptional turnout at the primaries , the voting is geared to leave her out , she is only supported by the 3rd largest party her etc etc etc * random person : but trump won hurr durr ; * fp : it 's not gon na happen , she 's too crazy . 
  everybody but her party will just gang against her like it happened before . 
  be niiiice , < 3 love . 
  i give up . 
  i 'm waiting till may so i can tell everybody : told ya so fuckers !, 
   how is poverty measured in france out of interest ? 
  same measurement . 
   do you think the way it is measured is useful ? 
  yes because inequality breeds discontent . 
  we do n't have starving people , but we do have social exclusion . 
  we do have people getting priced out of their neighborhoods where they grew up , we do have young people who can not afford to buy a home in paris or any major city . 
  and like it or not , inequality is a factor in the success of brexit or trump . 
  it is a reality when you see that the more educated voted to remain or hillary . 
  unless you believe that the more educated people are , the less informed ... and i 'm sure we can quickly find a bunch of sociologists that can show with relevant arguments why high relative poverty is a bad thing . 
   numbers are useful if they are measuring something useful . 
  that 's clear as day . 
  something is useful because it is useful . 
   but not all data is equally useful . 
  of course . 
  something that is less useful than something else is less useful .
