  maybe you missed the point that since the germans have no yet proposed any law regarding a face covering ban , this discussion is purely based on theory . 
  and speaking of theory , / u/marktplatz said that such a ban would be perfectly fine apparently in public closed spaces . 
   i posit that a general ban on public face covering is an infringement on religious freedom as understood by german law and likely unjustified but that 's a different matter . 
  then a bad on nazi symbols is infringement on religious freedom as well . 
  there might very well be some neo-nazis that think hitler was a god . 
   personally i think that anything above 2 % for a developed economy can be considered strong . 
  it used to be 3 % . 
  everybody knows that any alcoholic minor up to 17 and 364 days ( 365 on leap years ) should get significant help and once they reach 18 , they should be thrown out of the clinic . 
  everybody knows you stop suffering abuse at 18 . 
  remove burka ban and start talking about face covering ban in public spaces . 
   are you just articulating your personal opinion on the matter ? 
  no you are by refusing to understand vital differences . 
   there are some strongly growing economies in the eu at the moment , e.g. 
  uk http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-growth/forecast if 0.7 % of strongly growing ... yikes . 
  i fail to see in what shape or form she 's significantly different from hollande . 
  they 're both let the chips fall where they may , reacting to situations instead of influencing them . 
  were any of the comments obtained under duress used ? 
  it 's like i 'm talking in circles . 
  there is no ban on muslims . 
  i 'm no muslim but if i wear a burqa i 'd still get fined . 
  so what 's your point ? 
   i would be interested to see the aftereffects of such a law . 
  one would have to see that the actual effects of such a law would n't be too massive . 
  if they see you with a * face covering * veil you get a 150 euro fine . 
  again this is not some kind of fascist regime where you are killed or sent into debtor prison because fines are so high . 
  it 's a `` be reasonable '' type of thing . 
  there 's a dude paying 250k per year to cover the fines these women get ... and that 's cool . 
  well has the german court prevented degrading treatment ? 
   it 's irrelevant whether the law specifically targets religious face covering or if it is phrased more generally . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  it is ** essential ** . 
  again if the niqab becomes a transparent veil i will not care one yota . 
  but having people you can not ever see walking down the street ... that poses issues . 
   arguing that the purpose would be to ensure security and the public order is more plausible but i doubt it would meet the proportionality standard . 
  you made this long speech about irrelevant issues . 
  the law talks about hiding your face in public spaces : in the case of france , this is the law . 
  ctrl+f burqa see if you get any results . 
  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=jorftext000022911670 you are discussing from the legal stand point something that does not and should not appear . 
  if a person decides to wear a transparent burka ... for me that is perfectly fine . 
   who was suspected of having abducted a boy ( a suspicion that was later confirmed ) , with torture unless he reveals the location of the boy . 
  they found the boy dead . 
  oh my : o well then i guess i 'm happy the law was broken . 
  / s the law is the law no matter how gruesome , disgusting or vile the accused or the act they committed is . 
  i just simply explained that the echr is not some pointless court that exists in a void . 
  it has made significant improvements in how the justice system and in how our govts function in the eu . 
   how about we ban the bible because it says that you should kill gays and infidels ? 
  ban the bible from where ? 
   he far right values are just as bad as `` muslim values '' . 
  so because the niqab is a disgusting thing , i am a far right ? 
  you are very confused or very young and impressionable . 
   but in time for the ban hitler was not a religous symbol so there is a pretty big difference ... it 's pretty logical that we would protect religious rights if you consinder what happened in ww2 . 
  can you stop being ideological and start being logical and consistent for a second ? 
  no one stops anyone from declaring hitler a religious figure . 
  if one person believes he is magical , then he becomes a religion . 
  there is no standard for when a set of beliefs become religion . 
  do you think pastafarians actually believe in the fsm ? 
  they are pushing the limits . 
  pastafarians should make you think about what is allowed behaviour and what is not . 
  today pastafarians tomorrow hitlerians . 
  you either go the way of the us where all speech is basically ok , go the way of france : all speech based on imaginary beings is bullshit or maybe some other variants . 
  but what you propose here where some extremists are good while others are bad it total bullshit . 
   if their freedom is to waer a burka whatever , i do n't care , as long as they accept my freedoms too . 
  so why ca n't they wear a swastika or ss symbols ? 
  they do not infringe upon your freedom , do they ? 
   security inspections at courthouses work similarly . 
  in the courtroom , it is also expected that defendants or witnesses remove their veils , but there are no clear guidelines in place there ya go . 
  you 'd have a federal guideline  again i have the impression people are claiming that it can not be done for ideological reasons . 
  there seems to be ** no ** explicit reason why such a ban would fail . 
   the ultimate authority is the constitution and not the echr , even though they have n't publicly dissented from the echr in a major way so far . 
  of course . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:european_court_of_human_rights_cases_involving_germany one of the cases germany lost involves :  germany was convicted for violation of article 3 echr ( prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment in 2010 . 
  that 'd be a wee bit weird for the german justice system to throw a fit ... 
   can i have a conversation with someone that knows the german legal system and not someone wanting to get cheap shots in ? 
    is that too much to ask ? 
  again , read what / u/marktplatz your lawyers did n't say anything because no draft the law was presented . 
  can i have a conversation with someone that knows the german legal system and not someone wanting to get cheap shots in ? 
  is that too much to ask ? 
   i do n't care what the echr does . 
  i care about my courts , and i fully trust them to do their jobs right . 
  that is an extremely dangerous type of behaviour to have . 
  here is what the echr has previously condemned germany on :  partially won in 2010 : germany was convicted for violation of article 3 echr ( prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:european_court_of_human_rights_cases_involving_germany i find it particularly worrysome when someone does not care that their court system as not prevented degrading treatment for prisoners and an international court had to put their country back in place . 
  torture , threat of torture , degrading treatment ** are ** important things . 
  and why would a ban on face coverings in public spaces because of security reasons be deemed unconstitutional ? 
  this is n't at all immediate . 
  this is not a burkini ban . 
  can i enter with a balaclava in any public building in germany without ever revealing my identity ? 
  if i am refused entry , i can immediatly sue the german authorities and drag this to upper courts ... 
   just because the human rights court did n't repell it does n't mean ours wo n't , the consens of lawers that were asked until now is , that it 's not possible . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_human_rights#national_courts national courts integrate the decision of the echr . 
   nazi symbols are not religious for one and these laws are still there because they where necessary after ww2 , i do n't think anyone will change them tho because there is no interest or necessary . 
  if a spaghetti monster can become a religion , so can hitler . 
  you have this neo-colonial attitude : oh let the inferiors have their fun now but sooner of later they 'll realise our society of freedoms is better . 
  usually women in the west who wear niqabs know ** perfectly ** well why they are doing what they are doing . 
  they have significantly weighted everything out . 
  they are not dumb , stupid ** desperate for our integration ** , they do it because that is their desire after significantly weighing pros and cons . 
  you should start treating humans like humans . 
  and humans have different values and goals in life . 
  a face covering ban simply lets this people move in a country where their values are honoured . 
   me and you have different constitutions & political traditions . 
  that 's why it would be nice to actually hear from an expert in constitutional law on why germany would ban it while the echr would allow it .
