   but it does n't help to integrate people maybe you are confused since 2015 , but the job of a country is not to integrate people . 
  that is not the purpose of existence for the french republic nor is it the purpose of the german federation . 
  our countries have for purpose to create a community of like-minded people that respect certain values etc etc etc. 
   i ca n't imagine that many people woud just leave . 
  it is always a case of very few people that live according to these norms . 
  do to their extremist behaviour , they either change or they move out . 
   would n't be repelled from the courts immedatly . 
  well the european court of human rights did n't repeal the french ban on face coverings : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/france-burqa-ban-upheld-human-rights-court  maybe it solves a few single cases but i do n't believe it helps integration at all . 
  well okay . 
  maybe you do believe that your most important goal is integration as a nation . 
  that 's why germany exists on this planet : to integrate people . 
  then why are you banning nazi symbols , nazi propaganda etc ? 
  next the_donald will want to ban city dwellers from voting . 
   that a straight up `` ban '' would likely be considered unconstitutional . 
  what particular parts would be unconstitutional ? 
   `` religious freedom '' it is ** not ** a ban on religion but on all face coverings . 
   `` no credible threat to security '' https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/france-burqa-ban-upheld-human-rights-court why would the european court of human rights be ** less ** respective of human rights than a german high court ? 
   does n't really work on problems or is a good solution for anything . 
  i beg to differ . 
  the more crazy people that could not live without wearing a niqab or whatever simply moved out of france . 
  i believe that is a wonderful solution for us . 
  people getting to live in societies that they 'd feel comfortable living in . 
   it 's kindaaa anti-constitutional , as i say in my comment , why is it anti-constitutional to ban face coverings for security reasons in germany ? 
   which do n't get me wrong is important , however this tends to suppress the rankings of institutions in eastern europe who were mostly cut off from western academia during the soviet period . 
  so ... the most important factor for a society ? 
  teaching is fine and dandy but by and large everybody does the same thing . 
  research on the other thing determines who flies the best planes , who sends rockets into space , who has the most innovative tech , who has the most research in medicine ... etc. 
  but in th\u00e9 case of iter i fail to see what problem money would n't solve . 
  i find this analysis a bit pessimistic . 
  graphene was practically discovered 12 years ago . 
  nothing becomes a huge hit in a decade . 
  a lot of ideas/research opportunities stay in development hell : look at vr or deep learning ( which was developped in the 80s and only now we see amazing results ) iter took a long time because there was no international body ready and willing to develop it . 
  and well 20 billion for a reactor that will only work for 50 seconds to test and idea that if it goes perfectly to plan will result in actual reactors in some 50-60 years from now does n't sound especially sexy . 
  it 's include the 1 billion eu funded human brain project as an actual bs project . 
   a bit misleading heading . 
  it works for its intended purpose . 
  and as such it 's a great thing . 
  to discuss  talk or write about ( a topic ) in detail , taking into account different issues or ideas . 
  what idea or issue did you write about in detail ? 
  that the british isles are not drifting away from the continent ? 
  you were just acting dumb and you received the appropriate answer a meme , 
   hey now , the ~ ~ justice league ~ ~ suicide squad trailer looks pretty good, 
   ca n't people just discuss things you were not discussing anything . 
  you were acting dumb and you got treated as such , 
  ] ( https://gfycat.com/spotlessinfatuateddowitcher ), 
  it is sad , but then again , at least for europe , i think there is immense opportunity here to be had . 
  i really wan na be around here to see what europe becomes in the next 50 years . 
  does it matter ? 
  the main problem with the eea is freedom of movement . 
  and the efta also has that ... 
  switch roma to romanian and i 'm sure that score would rise , 
   thanks to dc for the referendum . 
  you do seem like the type that 'd enjoy the crap dc is releasing . 
  okay i 'll say it . 
  unless it 's in the spritz which i love , i really dislike prosecco . 
  : / i hope the italians can survive this crisis that i have pushed them into . 
   but i do n't think that 's what it shows at all . 
  i feel these conspiracy theorist muslims are actually broadly expressing the same inner feelings many of the terrorists have : a complete distrust , if not hate , for the western country or government they live in . 
  so you 've been on / r/the _ donald lately ? 
  is that full of musleeeems ? 
   do they stop if somebody/thing gets caught between it ? 
  [ if they need this sign ] ( http://imgur.com/r3bmsd9 ) i do n't think so . 
   the problem is the difference of mentality between north and south . 
  this is a chicken v egg story . 
  is there a difference of mentality created because of inequality and lack of investment , or the other way round .

  is russian orthodox not the true religion ? 
  what double standard ? 
  we also had stories like that when trump got elected . 
  and the markets bounced back and no one has been mentioning it again . 
  if the euro will continue to fall and remain for a long time at low levels compared to pre italy ref , then i 'll get worried and i 'll expect stories about this . 
  i mean they 're nice for the historic commentary . 
  but now the gdp has been at very low levels for quite a while . 
  you just addressed strangers * twice * today . 
  and once with you being the one that started it : o, 
  a central govt allows for better allocation of resources . 
  sure a larger share will go to the center ... but that 's good because rome is in the middle . 
  what you 're doing now is clearly not working . 
  you do n't have a two speed europe but a two speed country . 
  is there any massive investments plans ( infrastructure , start-up environment , tech , factories etc ) that will be rolled up for the south ? 
  i then also fail to understand why such a thing is impossible . 
  heck inequalities are * increasing * between north and south . 
  you ca n't just go : oh it 's the people , man . 
   ah yes , every day italians wake up and think ` man i hope some day we can be in the same league as germany and france ! ' . 
  well everyday french people do wake up and think what can we do to reduce the gap between france and germany ( unemployment , gdp , etc. ) . 
  the fact the fillon stands the most likely candidate to win the next elections is proof enough of the sacrifices we 're willing to endure to change things . 
   the more local government , the better . 
  is n't that type of view screwing the south ? 
  i really fail to see why italy 's number 1 priority is n't to reduce north-south inequalities . 
  i 'll choose blocking you man . 
  same thing . 
  it 's literally the next comment down . 
  and also in the same friggin comment :  i know it 's not the same you 're on reddit . 
  friggin read it . 
  ah the sweet taste of salt :d, 
  you 're a special kind of special are n't you ? 
  you can friggin bother to read the rest of the comments in this thread , you know !, 
   yes , because before 1960 , the western world was like sharia law . 
  are you saying it was n't ?
