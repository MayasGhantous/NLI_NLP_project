  http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/local/cache-vignettes/l530xh494/graph4-6e28f.jpg for over 65 , twice as many poor people in uk compared to france . 
  relative poverty counts no matter what people will try to make you believe . 
   in france also for example 2 out 3 young people would vote for le pen . 
  ** wrong ** . 
  http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/elections-regionales-2015/20151208.obs0971/elections-regionales-qui-a-vote-fn.html of those who vote ( since turnout at the last elections - regional - was some 48-50 % ) , 1/3 or 18-24 voted fn and 1/3 voted the left . 
  think it 's a wealth gap of sorts . 
  at least that would explain france . 
  fn does really poorly with older people because ... well ... old people do n't wan na rock the boat since they 're relatively well-off . 
  going out of the euro or eu would significantly make them poorer . 
   the fn in france do n't show the generational divide that ukip and particularly brexit do , for example . 
  yes they do . 
  namel older people absolutely hate them . 
  younger people do n't really love them , only the militant ones . 
   neoliberal laissez-faire market capitalism is the ( only ) way to go . 
  it has helped you profit from the eu by giving low taxes ... 
  there 's a reason companies like airbus group or renault-nissan and others are in the netherlands . 
   comes to environmental , ecology the netherlands is one of the worst per capita co2 emitters in the eu so yeah that 's something to worry about . 
  yeah did n't realise you have so many . 
  / u/versooo said this is a pretty high turnout . 
  i assumed that he meant wrt to regular elections and not other refs . 
  i know it 's not the same , but if you get 69 % turnout at french presidential elections , you 'd have an * unprecedentedly * low turnout . 
  edit : because people have trouble reading comments / u/versooo said this is a pretty high turnout . 
  i assumed that he meant wrt to regular elections and not other refs . 
  how is it undemocratic ? 
  if a party does not gather 50 % +1 seats , they do n't get to rule unconditionally . 
  why is the system ineffective then ? 
  also the turnout seems low ( though i 'll want confirmation ) . 
  what 's the turnout ? 
  honestly i had to stop reading this article for it is too dumb . 
  yeah , telling kids scientific facts like evolution and you need a woman and a man to make babies is definitely harmful to children . 
  / s poor dude , he 's getting punished for wanting to leave that a religious fundamental community and teaching his kids scientific facts that are absolutely benign . 
  https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2016/02/01/48-of-serbian-citizens-in-favor-of-joining-the-eu/ this is why serbia should n't join . 
  only under 50 % of the people want to join . 
  we do n't need one more country that does n't even want to be part of the project . 
  if the difference times 300 dollars is smaller than the price of a hair cut or meal , it could make it worth it . 
  but as / u/dogrulukpayi said , those prices are ridiculously low . 
   it goes without saying that afghanistan is considered safe enough yeah . 
  it 's * obvious * all of afghanistan is safe . 
   many of the reasons for expulsion is that the men are older than they themselves have specified and that they are given an age over 18 years . 
  only five of the detainees had entered a date of birth before 1991 , writes dagbladet what 's the big deal that only 5 said they 're born before 1991 . 
  someone born in 92 would be 23-24 yo now . 
  is 23 a minor in norway ? 
  that 's one expensive hair cut on the long run . 
  then again if the buy sell spread is small enough , you just exchange to liras , get your haircut , then change the money back to dollars . 
  great idea for the company to get some dollars instead of the liras it receives from its costumers . 
   when it comes to freedom of speech , the us is doing it better than france for sure . 
  luckly you 're free to move  let us live in the country we want to live in . 
   but a woman will not die because she choose to continue pregnancy . 
  your spelling killed me . 
  am dead . 
   it 's wrong to have a nanny state policing add gauchiasse/leftard in the mix because it 's mixing . 
  you 're hitting all the lingo man , do n't sell yourself short . 
   this is n't done anywhere and society works well if you give medical advice , that advice needs to be accurate with respect to widely held practices and knowledge in society . 
   if some people are dumb enough to fell for these websites , it 's their own fault . 
  again , are you acting dumb on purpose . 
  go to ivg.net and tell me if it 's obvious to you that it 's an utter bullshit job . 
  if you tell a cancer victim to not seek help cuz praying to god is better , you can expect to charged with not helping someone in danger , abuse of trust and other charges . 
  you seem to completely misunderstand how french society works . 
  we 're not the us buddy . 
   trying to prevent people from lying , or honestly holding and expressing mistaken opinions goes too far they are pretending to offer medical information . 
  if you do n't know , in france you need several degrees to be able to do that . 
   cheers . 
  it 's wrong to not expend wrong medical advice ? 
  you must not know how society works . 
   if you think that somebody else deciding it for you is better spoken like a true antivaxxer . 
  do n't act dumb . 
  the purpose is to target sites that are high visibility and spread harmful anti-medical advice . 
  if an idiot will believe it , its on his/her head . 
  how do you decide what to believe and what not to believe ? 
  imagine that in the spirit of freedom of expression we teach kids that homeopathic theory in schools ? 
   democracy is an opposite of such primitive thinking : its a way we , the people organize ourselves . 
  responslible beings with free will yeah no, 
  http://treatment.hpathy.com/homeo-medicine/homeopathy-diabetes/ try these homeopathic treatments for diabetes . 
  they work !, 
  if you ever get cancer just use homeopathic medicine . 
   no chemotherapy , nothing . 
  just homeopathic . 
  really it 'll cure your cancer . 
  http://treatment.hpathy.com/homeo-medicine/homeopathy-diabetes/ here 's homeopathic treatment for diabetes . 
  i really hope you 'll pull a jobs if you 're ever in that situation , 
  [ he did n't mean that * literally * . 
  he was talking about all the russia 's of the world , not * that * specific russia . 
  heck he ca n't even remember saying anything about russia and putin .

  1 german euro = 3 french euros . 
  more like we like our own french made slbms, 
  iron sky 's a documentary, 
   removing their names from the honor of having them on streets is n't denying or whitewashing . 
  no no . 
  you misunderstand . 
  / u / _ hopped _ learnt history in the streets . 
  cooking in trash cans and cpr next to glory holes ( one stroke , two stroke , 3 stroke breathe ), 
  the women are very patriotic too . 
  but they should name them only after worthy people like it 's the case now . 
  and not just women . 
  diesel cars emit a ton of particle pollution which is the worst type of pollution in cities . 
  considering that paris is full of diesel cars ( it did have quite a few days these past years where they had to impose restrictions because particle pollution was reaching emergency levels ) i can guarantee they wo n't be able to implement this full by 2025 . 
  8 years is deffo not enough . 
   my account is even banned from r/islam i can see you mean business, 
  yeah man .
