   thing to act on the integration of people . 
  so france was poor at integration . 
  who 's doing a great job at integration , huh ? 
  show me an example . 
   i live in canada and my city is over 50 % foreign born and i do n't see the sort of downward spiral of civil engagement h uuu . 
  tell me about the native canadians . 
  i heard they live a wonderful life , 
  so it is removed or not ? 
  i 'm confused . 
   swedes are living just fine as always and yes , most cases of violence and rape are carefully cherry-picked to support an agenda , which is not to say that these cases are n't bad or do n't deserve attention . 
  yes . 
  there are two parallel societies . 
  one living just dandy and the other also . 
  sadly they collide from time to time . 
  see ... well france . 
   then they wonder why the roma hate the majority population or refuse to assimilate . 
  it 's kinda amazing . 
  the hatred towards them is open , direct , forward . 
  yet they still did n't friggin riot or whatever . 
   you 're just jealous we gave the italians the top spot instead of you !, 
  nope , cuz frankly i agree with that choice . 
  france has a larger variaty in cuisine and i believe much better cheese and desserts . 
   was trying to keep it as short as possible , but yeah , that 's true . 
  well you missed the most important aspect of his presidency . 
  before him , there was a transition of power , but there was a tacit agreement to keep the corpses buried . 
  who went to jail once the iliescu ( and his fsn/pdsr clique ) was replaced by emil constantinescu . 
  maybe just miron cozma . 
  who went to jail once constatinescu and his clique was replaced by iliescu/nastase and his psd clique ? 
  he refused to play the game that was played for 15 years before him ( you do n't send my guys to jail when i 'll get to power and i wo n't send your guys once i get to power ) . 
  romania was and still is crippled by corruption and local barons but finally he got it in a nash equilibrium if you want . 
   the thing happened . 
  the thing happened to the roma too . 
  gitanes in french . 
  and the chelsea fans being racist in a parisian subway last year http://www.lemonde.fr/football/article/2015/02/18/enquete-ouverte-apres-un-incident-raciste-impliquant-des-fans-de-chelsea_4578782_1616938.html, 
   ... has the best food ( top 5 ) ? 
   italy 33 %  united kingdom 24 % uk second place ? 
  you guys really lack taste buds . 
  is it because you made one good dish ; chicken tikka masala ? 
   who would you put top ? 
  honestly ? 
  germany . 
  the irish one ? 
  poor irish , you brits can not stop stealing their stuff . 
  especially since the answer is germany . 
  seems so . 
  on frech tv we got that he was turned in by a friend who gave his number and also the phone number he was using . 
  they used the phone number to track his whereabouts . 
  i usually put tabasco sauce . 
  anchovy pizzas too . 
   ' i was going to kill myself but i changed my mind '   fucking coward . 
  because he did n't kill more innocents ? 
  are those terries that blew themselves up brave souls ? 
  neah he did the right thing for once in his life . 
   it still is very strange that he could live in the open for such a long time . 
  i mean , the normal thing to do is to report him to the police immediately . 
  why did so many people allow him to go free ? 
  that is a real question . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/article/2016/03/19/a-molenbeek-qui-a-vu-quoi-qui-a-entendu-quelque-chose_4886058_4809495.html some believe he is innocent and it 's a conspiracy from the secret services and the sionists ... that they did n't kill anyone . 
   l\u2019islam , c\u2019est la paix islam is peace and since it is peace it can not kill . 
  they can not kill in the name of allah or mohammed , it was the jews . 
  simple . 
   yup , there even was a woman from molenbeek who claimed that many people knew all along that he was in that house . 
  he was turned in by a friend . 
  he was turned in by a friend . 
  that 's unacceptable and must change . 
  bombs romania . 
  so he did n't get it legally , that 's what you mean . 
  i ask the hard questions . 
  darn this story is crazy . 
  great job on the security guards . 
   the attacker was janos b. 
  ( criminal suspects ' family name ca n't be published in hungary ) . 
  he became briefly famous in 2012 , when he blew up his shed accidentaly , while he was working on a tube bomb . 
  well safe to say he was a crazy person . 
  but my question : why is the attacker 's face blurred while his mom is shown in full ? 
   this is a terrible person that tried to kill people . 
  ** but ** because we 're good journalists we wo n't show his face . 
  here 's his mom though . 
  edit : missed this part  additional ammo in his backpack , altogether 240 rounds , beside a knife and a ** great amount of chocolate bars ** . 
  will he play the [ twinkie defense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twinkie_defense ) :d, 
  i 'm a sovereign citizen . 
  your country 's laws do not apply to me . 
  am i being detained ? 
  did n't know bernie was butthurt . 
  why did n't they close that airport ? 
  in bad weather you just shut it down and tell everybody to find another place to land . 
  goddamit why do i always end up talking to 16 yos . 
   `` the economy '' being the reason really shows which ideals are really important . 
  yes . 
  turns out unemployed people are n't happy people . 
  weird is n't it ? 
  if you think poor people make for good people , try reading up on the french revolution . 
   naughty list pitching tents . 
  i thnk these people also work a lot on hunches , rumors , word of mouth info that might not be accurate at all . 
  but their plans might not fit reality . 
  while i agree with your sentiment , there are also a few organised panhandling schemes around europe that exploit people and send them across the continent to beg for money . 
  there are people with small children out in the cold . 
  that 's not a safe environment for them . 
   i would find that quite legit ( pkk case ) . 
  what a ghandi and non-violent civil protests ?
