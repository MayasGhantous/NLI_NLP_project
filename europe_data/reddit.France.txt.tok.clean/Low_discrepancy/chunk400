  but i 'd always expect russia to be the last to pull this kind of crap :(, 
  neah . 
  putin 's using this excuse to limit free speech . 
  never let a good tragedy go to waste ... even if it happens in another country, 
   i do n't honestly trust anyone making a prediction either way , so it 's 50/50 for you . 
  care to make a 100 euro wager ? 
  i was starting to think isis were the good guys . 
  so we 've been bombing is for nuttin ? 
   no , that 's why they have an office building in paris , but the actual work in other countries . 
  til i never actually done work at airbus ... you do n't even understand the difference between airbus group and airbus . 
  * sigh *, 
  i am french so when i say listen to the brit . . you can bet i know what i 'm saying . 
   not the system that allows him to do it !, 
  i wonder how legal such a thing it . 
  when i sign my employment contract , i sign with my name . 
  i do n't create a front company based in bahamas that signs my employment contract for me . 
  and how can he get the money out of that company ? 
  listen to the brit . 
  they know how terrible bland food is and how valuable spices are . 
  panettone means diversity people . 
   the netherlands has the largest space center in europe a what now ? 
   makes sense to have operations here . 
  there are operations there because of fiscal reasons but that 's another debate . 
  there are airbus operations in netherlands and airbus is the biggest military tech in europe . 
  so yeah ... pretty dumb to say european defense just means funding french operations . 
  but then again the dutch are quite a salty people ... they bitch about the eu yet they 'd be pretty screwed without the fiscal advantages the eu gives . 
   he had time to analyse it that 's stupid . 
  no country has done well after the recession . 
  not us , not uk , not germany . 
  growth rates are low as hell for every country . 
  you are asking blood from stone in a country that refuses any type of reform whatsoever . 
  whatabout !, 
  :'( world no fair, 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia because google is too complicated for you, 
   we do , but all the money will be going to dcns . 
  you 're free to compete with the dcns . 
  do you make any nuclear subs  ? 
   not we , there 's no we . 
  france will lose another industry , which is how it should be , as with an open economic system you need to be competitive or do something else for a living . 
  airbus is also located in netherlands buddy . 
  http://www.airbusdefenceandspacenetherlands.nl/ ignorant people ... ignorant people everywhere . 
   france has history of `` betrayal '' . 
  look up how france `` betrayed '' israel , which had to look for other sources of weapons . 
  let 's rewind here : * [ france pushed for israel to be included in the attack on egypt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis#the_franco-israeli_alliance_emerges ) . 
  this war almost caused france getting nuked by the ussr and us asked for economic sanctions . 
  * france helped greatly israel to achieve its nuclear goals . 
  * de gaulle wanted the nuclear plants to be [ checked by international experts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_israel#rift_between_israel_and_france ) . 
  the israeli were n't super keen on that and that created problems . 
   education is `` free '' up until college , which is about another trillion dollars , mostly funded at a local level . 
  if college would be free ( essentially free ) would n't that mean the 1 trillion in student debt would be part of the us budget ? 
  0 comments ... seems about right . 
  also vlach comes from the celtic wales . 
   france offers hard power , humanitarian , military and security assistance you fight fire with fire . 
  in an economic debate , you fight with economics . 
  we have to be ready to foot bills if we give up austerity and want to impose our will . 
  and france is absolutely not capable of doing that . 
  yup . 
   from what i 've seen online until now , she has even more potential for her political career than her aunt does . 
  restrict abortion rights , full on catholic . 
  on the public scene she 'd soon be irrelevant . 
  she lost the regional election against a buffoon . 
  ok ` im done with this ridiculous convo . 
  cheers, 
   is it because every few months a few dozen frenchmen yeah not refugees . 
   but remember that he denied having ever said it before acknowledging it in his own book should he admit to private conversations ? 
  since when ? 
   he did n't even try to deny it , which makes him look even less trustworthy . 
  that 's bs . 
  he managed it very well by not discussing it . 
   france has a very decent military with nuclear capability and a seat on the security council so we 'll threaten to nuke germany ? 
  it 's germany not russia we 're talking about . 
  when we do n't fulfill ** any ** condition ( debt larger than 60 % , deficit larger than 3 % ) when unemployment is at 10 % we do n't have many chips on the table . 
  we have to show we 're ready to foot bills ... and we 're not, 
   if france were to leave the eu the project would be dead ... 
  carrot and stick , you have leverage . 
  that 's not a carrot and stick that 's a '' if you do n't do what i say , i 'll kill myself ! '', 
   neither are millions of socially/financially costly refugees . 
  we do n't have that problem . 
   i think it was in a text he sent his wife at the time you should tell / u/rinasciment the whole truth . 
  his gf was a completely crazy and manipulative person . 
  the comment ( either true or not ) was made in a private setting and we do not know the context . 
  he probably wanted to dump her before the election but couldnt . 
  you can see the guy does n't even want to [ kiss her ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvychmqh1o&amp;t=1m13s ) at the night of the election , he 's super reluctant to , after she orders him to kiss her on the lips . 
  also imagine if your exes go through all your former private emails and texts and publishes the worst stuff ? 
   - he had years to prepare alternance , four years to prepare a counter to the crisis the main left candidate was ** not ** hollande , but [ this dude ] ( http://www.actuanews.fr/photo/art/grande/8147816-12714331.jpg?v=1439802034 ) . 
   he underestimated the crisis , for the first two years he thought it would quickly solve itself , and did n't do much except increase taxes ( despite promising in campaign not to do so and antagonized a lot of french ) i 'm sorry but how is it his fault ? 
  the * whole * of europe has ridiculously low levels of growth . 
  what do you want him to do ? 
  if he had done 0 hour contracts like uk has , he would have been eaten alive . 
   the french president really has the potential to be a counterbalance to merkel . 
  based on what ? 
  what forte do we have ? 
  until the economy does n't pick up , we have no strong arm . 
  okay so netherlands up to 1919 , us up to that period or switzerland up to 1970 ( and in some cantons 1993 ) were not democracies . 
  good to know, 
  ah , so you agree then that immigration does not supress wages . 
  cheers . 
  you already have puddin ', 
   peed at which it is happening . 
  ah yes .
