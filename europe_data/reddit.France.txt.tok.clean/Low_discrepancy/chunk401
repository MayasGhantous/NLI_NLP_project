  we got ta look at the first derivatives . 
  maybe check the acceleration and jerk too . 
  let 's analise the vega , vanna and vomma of this stochastic process . 
   by 2080 the uk is predicted to grow 30 % , to have a population as large as germany 's ( in 2016 ) , but in a country 50 % smaller . 
  whilst germany is predicted to have shrunk 19 % to 65.4 million . 
  fine take france then . 
  we 'll have significant growth too and we have significant foreign population . 
  the current one . 
  how immigration suppress wages . 
  present your peer reviewed articles . 
  this is the argument you were debating with / u/abstractlemgth, 
   yet the eu has been so ineffective in dealing with the problem . 
  dealing how ? 
   most europeans do n't want a mass influx of migrants from the middle east you 're speaking for whom ? 
  the germans ? 
  seems that they , despite the crisis are not rebelling, 
   ou linked the exact article i did . 
  oh god  ), 
   i follow arguments rather than experts . 
  present the arguments . 
   how on earth is this level of immigration sustainable in the medium/long term ? 
  same way we have 1.2 million portuguese in france https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_people_in_france you survive and move on . 
  so they have the same amount of foreigners ... is germany planning on leaving the eu because ? 
   as an individual you still need to consider whether or not someone really is an expert . 
  amazing how in some topics you follow experts and in others you go the full on sceptic route . 
   blindly following an expert is profoundly anti-intellectual . 
  it 's pure intellectualism to bow down to those that have ** more ** knowledge than you do . 
  it is an essential aspect of science . 
  to admit hey i was wrong because other people 's arguments are better than mine . 
  present your own studies if you want a debate . 
  do not go : `` oh make your own mind according to what you think '' , because that 's exactly anti-intellectualism . 
  it is ** exactly ** the same thought process that drives anti-vaxxers , creationists etc. 
  they say hey who cares about the experts , make up your own mind . 
  do not blindly follow blah blah blah . 
  you are just using mental gymnastics here . 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy government by the people ; especially : rule of the majority that 's the definition that is widely accepted . 
   protection of the human rights of all citizens is woman suffrage a human right ? 
   talk about `` tyranny of the majority '' then , not democracy . 
  democracy is something different . 
  that depends on the definition of a democracy . 
  is the us in 1900 a democracy ? 
   the rule of law is important but it is n't even a form of governance . 
  it is a restriction of pure democracy . 
  let 's take an actual case . 
  death penalty . 
  the majority of french are in favor of it . 
  but the people in power who actually have to trigger the process find it morally reprehensive . 
  so that 's why ( though it 's more complicated than that ) we do n't have a death penalty . 
  people who have to apply the law do n't want it . 
   ~ ~ complett ~ ~ complete moron it does n't even make ~ ~ sence ~ ~ sense ftfy  now move on, 
  a long and stable political process . 
  not what 50 % +1 people decided today . 
   rule of law but which laws ? 
  human rights but which ones rules determined by a long history , laws determined by trial and error . 
  just because 50 % +1 of people decide on one thing today , that does not make that thing just , fair , good on the short or long run . 
  i 'm sure to bet that the most significant of our laws were made before we 've become democracies . 
  heck women could n't vote till 100 years ago . 
  so claiming that our countries were democracies when 50 % could n't vote is ridiculous . 
   but democracy is based on rule of law and human rights . 
   you say that like the end goal of a democratic system there is no end goal to a political process . 
  it 's always a work in progress . 
  your thought process seems to be rather simple for someone who goes around and call others ignorant so liberally . 
  i did n't start the bullshit insults . 
   that is what we call a democracy , even if it is not the technical meaning of the word , but this merely a semantic argument no it is not as my argument shows . 
  politicians and law makers use this as a bait and switch . 
  every time they wan na pass a law to erode the system in place they just say : oh i got the majority of votes , so i rule . 
  we 've seen exceptional erosions like this during the war in iraq or during the brexit debate . 
  and again when trump was elected . 
  lies upon lies upon lies . 
  but that 's okay because polls say people wanted the war on iraq ( well of course when you trumpet all day long how iraq has wmd 's how can you not want war ? ), 
   the majority takes back control with more or less violence that 's simply not true . 
  see capital punishment in france . 
   authoritarianism often comes with corruption . 
  that 's a false dichotomy . 
  this is n't a binary choice here . 
  you either accept the tyranny of the majority or you get authoritarianism . 
   where did i claim that ? 
  when you said  other forms of government have much worse conditions where you said that . 
   is just dodging the spirit of the question no it is not . 
  it is essential to distinguish democracy and the current systems we have in place . 
  the current system of balances , checks , super laws ( constitutions ) , separation of the 3 powers , independent press , election systems that are significant are all important to the functioning of society . 
  by putting democracy on a pedestal , we start ignoring the others . 
  and the canary is the press and investigate journalism . 
  we live in a post-truth political system but we 're still told everything is fine because it 's the result of the vote . 
  well that 's utter bs . 
   other forms of government have much worse conditions i believe a country based on rule of law is better than a purely democratic country . 
  a country that values human rights is better than a purely democratic country . 
  oh and the fact that you think all philosophical ethical moral etc issues are solved simply by saying the magic d word , kinda shows ignorance on your part . 
  democracy is rule by majority . 
  if you have no system to overrule the majority when the majority is wrong , you will find yourself on a slippery slope . 
   intelligence agency has spied on french public 's phone calls literally the first phrase . 
  i told you of examples of france spying on us citizens . 
   i 'm not french so i do n't read french news , but you 're being naive if you do n't believe it happen in some form or another . 
  i 'm pretty sure if france was spying on you , you 'd know of it by now ... just like we know the us can gather all our data . 
   well that 's . . terrifying . 
  why ? 
  democracy in its most pure form just means rule of the majority . 
  surely an idea does n't become magical if 50 % +1 think it 's good , right ? 
   let 's also not pretend that other western nations are any better . 
  ok . give me examples of french spying on us citizens .
