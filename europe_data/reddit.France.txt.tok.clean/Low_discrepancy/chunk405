  just like vergetures gland also means acorn in french so that 's the most likely origin of the word . 
   netherlands not too familiar with that history . 
  but i can easily imagine the dutch being a subfamily of germanic tribes  uk anglo-saxons so not really . 
   bulgaria slavic so they came after rome had fallen and the connections with the byzantine empire are kinda well sketchy ... 
  using the eagle is emulation of the roman empire ( as it was used proeminently by the holy roman empire or the russian empire - which liked to believe they 're succesors ) . 
  the lion though ... meh . 
   if small states could just be drowned out by the larger population states , they would have good reason to leave the union . 
  well let 's see , shall we . 
  http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/campaign-events-2016 all these states had ** 0 ** campaign events . 
  * alabama * alaska * arkansas * delaware * district of columbia * hawaii * idaho * kansas * kentucky * louisiana * maryland * massachusetts * montana * new jersey * new york * north dakota * oklahoma * oregon * rhode island * south carolina * south dakota * tennessee * vermont * west virginia * wyoming are you saying montana , tenessee , north dakora , idaho , west virginia and wyoming are huge states ? 
  the us electoral vote = us swing state vote . 
  only swing states matter so one should be extremely careful with electoral college vote . 
   lions were an animal of prestige to romans , and people everywhere in europe thought anything that the roman empire thought of as cool was cool . 
  well besides belgium and spain , none of the countries colored have a history related to rome or the roman empire . 
  so that ** is odd ** . 
  whereas there were lions in ancient greece , and ancient greece was revered by romans the lions the romans were likely from africa or the caucasus since lions in greece had been extincted by 100 bc . 
  still does n't explain why the north is so fascinated with lions since they never had any . 
   as for the aero - portion of aerospace , we did have that , until our economy collapsed after the wars . 
  aww . 
  sux !, 
  apparently rich economies have good things . 
   the whole society should n't have to bend over to accommodate this unfortunate minority of individuals . 
  oh do n't worry they leave . 
  why do you think people like tesla left ? 
  but hey being poor is better cuz damn you vegans . 
  but that 's like putting a mammoth on your coat of arms . 
  and none of the nordic countries ever had lions on their territory, 
   those fancy jobs ? 
  they are just ways to afford fancier things yes . 
  working on some of the most interesting projects in the world is just to pay for vacations  . 
  tell me what aerospace industry you have in serbia . 
  it means that i can go to a university that has enough money to do top quality research , so being taught by some of the best people in their fields . 
  and when i go get a job , i have a selection of some of the finest industries in the world in areas like airplane manufacturing , nuclear industry , train industry , military high tech , satellite industry , banking etc. 
  when i vacation i can go to a ton of places on the globe and if i 'm sick i do n't have to bribe the doctor . 
  but you 're right , being in a rich country or a fast developing country is all about veganism and weak moral values  ) . 
  it 's good to know you have your priorities straight . 
  higher standards of living , better quality of life etc should always take second place to fewer vegans . 
  or something like that . 
  ruuuuun, 
  sarkozy the socialist ... reddit -  you read it all here . 
   thatcherism is on the extreme edge of european economic politics , even more so in social-welfare oriented countries . 
  reality and dreams are two different things . 
  proof : he was pm for 5 years . 
  unless you people think sarkozy fought to save the social welfare of france ... 
  and honestly , between fillon and jupp\u00e9 , there is n't a huge difference . 
  the both wanted to slash budgets left and right . 
  it 's just that fillon is moe cosy to russia and that he wants to slash 500k govt employees to jupp\u00e9 's 250k . 
   france falls from one extreme into the other . 
  first the socialists with exorbitant tax rates and now a hard-core neocon . 
  none are extremists . 
  who are these hipsters ? 
   seeing belgrade turn into an internationalist city of foreigners and hipsters is about the last thing i want to happen . 
  yup . 
  that 's the eu . 
  that shit is pathetic . 
   the quality of life in yugoslavia prior to the fall of the iron curtain was much higher than in most ( if not all ) of those nations higher than cechoslovakia or hungary ? 
  you got ta be kidding . 
   due to foreign imports being banned well we no longer live in such a world . 
  now serbia has a lower gdp per capita than any eu country . 
   worked for yugoslavia define work ... because up to 1980 ( tito 's death ) , yugoslavia was the 3rd crappiest country [ wrt to gdp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia#/media/file:eastern_bloc_economies_gdp_1990.jpg ) . 
  wtf is that ? 
   30 to 40 % of the voters . 
  must be joking man . 
  `` cities '', 
  stop fucking feeding the troll , goddammit, 
   breivik was a direct consequence of muslim immigration . 
  so if norway never had had muslim immigration , i do n't think he had decided to kill those people . 
  and if germany did n't have jewish , there would n't have been any holocaust . 
  it makes perfect sense . 
   i believe denmark would be a lot safer place if we had taken in more christian refugees and less muslim . 
  someone send in some ugandan xtians and some srebenica xtian serbs to denmark . 
  because we 've had laws against discrimination based on religious beliefs for a very very long time ? 
   i see russians everywhere ... you 're not crimean so i doubt that 's real . 
  is it bad that i laughed out loud at that story ? 
  it 's just so ridiculous . 
  i can imagine a dude coming in with a 10 yo girl to talk to the mall santa . 
  joy all around , kids are cheerfully running about the mall , parents are carrying big shopping bags stuffed with gifts , xmas carols are blasting through those shitty mall speakers . 
  santa says : '' ho ho ho you have a very beautiful daughter , sir ! '', 
  she 's my wife . 
  honest mistake . 
  :d '' o_o, 
   he just could n't think of anyone besides her and putin . 
  yeah . 
  he can only remember people who saw at least semi nude . 
   he 's not threatening baltic countries but is threatening germany, 
   `` you were right : bipartisanship has died . 
  it is now a single party , ppsoe . 
  we 'll always help you . '', 
  so the dude talks like fn propaganda ... 
  if you know any information , call the police . 
  thank you . 
   many french people have foreign origin . 
  they do n't really speak the language of their ancestors though . 
   to compare , you can look at the dental market in the us which is much less regulated and a much more efficient private market and you find that prices are pretty in line with rich countries around the world . 
  & nbsp ;  another example of a good private medical market in the us is eye surgery . 
  and here i am thinking that dental and eye care are usually the most expensive stuff in our system . 
   informal payments is that how the call it nowadays ? 
   would be interesting to see the heart diseases rates within france and see if there is a visible split between north and south ( although i have heard that the frenchmen 's love of red wine somehow makes up for the dangers of animal fats ) . 
  https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortality-cardiovascular-disease-europe.jpg no divide and we 're doing better than italy . 
  how does that work when no country takes into account negative externalities ?
