  how does it work when a country is dumping prices ? 
  it can very well wait until all other countries lose the industries and capabilities to produce and start rising prices . 
  and how about defense industries ? 
  would you let china make your slbms ? 
  459 million a week for job creators , that 's good news . 
  it 'll trickle down !, 
   in the 250 years that the usa has been in existence , france has had multiple periods of revolution and anarchy , and germany went bonkers and invaded the rest of europe twice and mass murdered millions . 
  that is real anarchy , trump being elected president is just an election of a guy who will be constrained by congress and the usa will still perform better than both france and germany . 
  france and germany shared a continent with uk , spain , autro-hungary , ottoman empire , italy , etc all vying for power . 
  the us had only to fight the indians and a few mexicans and the brits but they got help from the french just to screw with them . 
  comparing history does n't work like that . 
  it seems that people in favor of the electoral college are just using the bullshittiest excuses . 
  it 's not a state vote , it 's not a vote that gives more rights to rural people , it 's not a vote that favours the disenfranchised or disadvantaged . 
  it 's a swing state vote . 
   the us has a diverse demographic and letting one group of people from particular regions decide the election is hardly democratic . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization_by_country germany is more rural than the us . 
  france is more urban . 
  yet they did n't descend into anarchy . 
   otherwise people in states like iowa or ohio would n't have their voices heard because of high population states new york and california that are overwhelmingly liberal/democrat . 
  http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/campaign-events-2016 well how about the mighty states * alabama * alaska * arkansas * delaware * district of columbia * hawaii * idaho * kansas * kentucky * louisiana * maryland * massachusetts * montana * new jersey * new york * north dakota * oklahoma * oregon * rhode island * south carolina * south dakota * tennessee * vermont * west virginia * wyoming that saw ** 0 ** ( ** zero ** ) campaign events . 
  90 % of the states i gave in this list are rural as fuck . 
  or should only ohio and iowa count as rural . 
  to me it seems you are confusing swing states with rural states . 
  huge mistake, 
   the states are there for a reason it 's not a fucking state vote . 
  you can still win an election with a minority of states . 
   it 's called the united states of america , not america . 
  well apparently your elections are the * united states of florida , ohio , illinois and other swing states * . 
  fascinating . 
   if you want to tell me that public health care in eu is of higher quality than private insurance in the us then i will only laugh , sorry . 
  buck for buck , we 're doing better at almost every major statistic . 
  thing is , us health care is like a ferrari . 
  it 's fucking brilliant ... but few can afford the brilliant part . 
  the majority are stuck with walking . 
  europe is more like nice public transport . 
  sure you wo n't see it on top gear , but it 's very cheap , well maintained and it 'll get you from point a to point b. 
   happy she looks pretty [ serene here ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2477470/images/o-merkel-facebook.jpg ), 
  how 's hanna ? 
  eh it 's pretty obvious what he meant . 
   personally i m not convinced that alternate systems are better enough to make a substantial difference . 
  you seem to think so , that 's fair . 
  there is no cultural difference why americans vote in far fewer numbers than other western democracies ... except fptp and electoral college system that means people have no reason to come and vote unless they 're in a swing state . 
  that 's a reality . 
  large numbers of people are completely ignored and that ** is objectively a bad thing ** . 
  and before that the ukrainians took sloviansk http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28174104 point still stands : russia had no intention to respect said agreement . 
   your leaders are smart enough to realize that they need to talk to russia , and so they do . 
  do i live in bizzaro world where russia is sanctioned while in your universe it is not ? 
  i doubt that is the case . 
   russia being special and having more rights than most is enshrined deep into the international law , by them being unsc permanent members . 
  when 2 members of the unsc invaded a some random country , they were told to fuck off immediatly . 
  and they did . 
  russia is being told to back off with sanctions . 
  because that 's the only lingo they understand . 
   i 'm talking about both ceasefires which came after russian military victories . 
  there were advances made by the ukranians in july 2014 . 
  in sept they sign minsk 1 but the russians never had any desire to respect it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_protocol#efficacy let 's not do a russia and rewrite history to fit our narrative , mkay ? 
  a fptp in popular votes which is still retarded . 
  if you want to see some logical voting systems go to cgpgrey . 
  do i have to spoon feed you everything ? 
   i remember russia not blocking france 's intentions vis a vis libya in the un thus giving a tacit approval well there ya go !, 
  no one gave any approval for little green men . 
   how will you negotiate with them in that case ? 
  talking saved ukraine for example . 
  are you talking about minsk 1 that was aborted because the russians did n't feel like making peace ? 
  if russia only understands sanctions , then so be it . 
  we 'll speak russia 's language / . 
   lepen wins the `` poppular vote '' in the first round if there is no second round . 
  t you just described fptp . 
  nope . 
  cgpgrey was already shitting on the electoral system before this election . 
   because she won the popular vote in the democratic primaries . 
  primaries are not official elections . 
  they could decide who represents their parties by who gives the best hand jobs for all i care . 
   its funny how you think international law matters anymore has the us renegade on an agreement they signed in the last 30-40 years . 
  i 'm being generous , should ask since 94 . 
   keep your blinders on some more , sooner or later they 'll get taken off in a nuclear blast . 
  russia 's such a poor country , it 's the only way they could hope of ever reaching the level of even italy . 
  ever . 
  if russia likes to be free regarding previous agreements , russia can be free regarding trade . 
  we wo n't bog it down with any west trade . 
   keep your blinders on some more , sooner or later they 'll get taken off in a nuclear blast . 
  if russia wants frozen conflicts in europe , russia can continue being poor . 
   budapest memorandum is tantamount to a promise i 'll leave with you this : russia does not respect signed ** agreements ** . 
   , brexit and trump , also syria cool they can jump start trade with syria , 
   lepen is winning the popular vote vs any single candidate ... remember fptp and second round are the most retarded thing ever yes fucker . 
  le pen ** losses ** the popular vote against jupp\u00e9 or fillon . 
  french electoral system is 2 rounds . 
  thank you for proving to me that fptp is retarded . 
  it 's a numbers game . 
  and le pen 's are smaller than fillon 's or jupp\u00e9 's, 
   you already have it , in a form of `` refugees '' and rising nationalism leading to weakening of your main alliances like eu and nato . 
  yeah . 
  60k refugees we have in france will destroy us . 
   do n't underestimate other countries just because they are not like your own country . 
  you do realise that russia hasthe gdp of italy while having * twice * its population ? 
  russia is poor as fuck !, 
  so russia does n't respect ** agreements ** and it wants fair trade . 
  russians must be living in their own poor bubble . 
   moody 's forecasts that the 1 % economic contraction in 2016 will be followed by a modest 1.5 % real gdp growth in 2017 wow . 
  1.5 . much large .
