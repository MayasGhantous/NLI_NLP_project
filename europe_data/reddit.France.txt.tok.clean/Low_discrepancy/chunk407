  from a country ** twice ** as big as italy but the same gdp . 
  russians will graduate from shitting in the outhouse and whipping with leaves to shitting in the outhouse and whipping with tp ? 
   but with the recovery , trump and brexit ? 
  russia has * minimal * trade with the us and uk . 
  it 's with continental eu . 
   that 's putin 's ticket out . 
  russians live in their tiny bubble where they think they ca n't act like toddlers and still demand respect . 
  they 're clueless to how global politics works so they keep voting for the same idiots in some masochistic tendency . 
  so be it !, 
  no sanctions will be lifted until donbass is left alone . 
  that is obvious to everybody . 
  once ukraine can freely go from lvov to donetsk then maybe we can start negotiating . 
  does it bother russia ? 
  then let russia impose sanctions on the eu !, 
  we 're all so scared of the giant with an empty stomach, 
   and lepen wins the popular vote by very secure margin in france for now . 
  are you interested ? 
  are you interested in maths lessons ? 
   by france from times of charlemagne france ... charlemagne ? 
  come again ? 
  you do understand that france has nothing to do with what was happening during charlemagne . 
  but hey , if russia has balls , let it start economic sanctions for france for that . 
  i 'm sooo scared of a country so poor, 
   but you know that if the eu integration will go further in the future , the elections in europe will work similarly , and let say , the baltic countries will be able to outvote germany . 
  none of that makes any sense . 
  you inventing systems does n't make it real . 
  it does n't even work for the current eu parliament . 
  the baltic ca n't overrule romania . 
  if a federation will ever be on the plate it 'll happen like for the eurozone or the european army . 
  strong core countries form together and other might or might not join . 
  but the system will be proportional . 
  frankly having small countries is basically irrelevant . 
   sure , and there were also no russian soldiers in crimea . 
  but there 's poverty in russia . 
  i guess sanctions are n't so fun , are they . 
   , and most populous 40 equal to close to half . 
  so they 'd have to campaign in 40 areas instead of 5 . 
  that 's a huuuuge plus . 
   nothing more than a promise . 
  i can sign a memorandum with a friend to agree that the colour of the sky is blue , it does n't mean anything since it 's not legally binding . 
  it is an ** agreement ** . 
  they agreed to respect ukraine 's borders and sovereignty . 
  let 's see if their new found poverty is legally binding . 
  the ruble has taken a dive , the deficits are sky high and they spent 20 % of their monetary reserve funds to prop up the system . 
  if they do n't like the rules of politics , let 's see if they 'll enjoy the rules of economics . 
  so if your imaginary cia coup happened , that gives you the right to invade territory that you should n't invade ? 
   new york metropolitan area alone consist of 25 million people . 
  so that 's 10 % of the voting population . 
  do you think you 'd win an election just talking to 10 % of the people ? 
  i find it amazing how much of sticklers americans are to traditions . 
  if the founding fathers did it like this , then we should all do it like this . 
  ( what about slavery ? 
  okay everything like them except slavery ) . 
   nothing more than a promise do you understand the ** signed agreement ** ? 
  it 's not difficult to understand really . 
  not difficult at all . 
   lown turnout in american elections has more to do with american political system in large being a steaming pile of shit well unless you 're in a swing state , you do n't matter . 
  here 's the spending per state http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/10/26/bbstates_custom-e0c6c871e5a185100d0be94271fba73c0a365998-s900-c85.jpg huge parts of the country do n't matter and that is utterly ridiculous . 
  well bush and trump would n't have won . 
  that 's 2 prez in such a short period . 
   retarded does not mean illegitimate . 
  of course . 
  i mean illegitimate but i was using an epithet . 
   also claiming that clinton won if us only decided with popular vote is stupid , since there are a lot of republicans in highly blue and red states that did not vote too . 
  it does n't matter . 
  what matters is that the popular vote disagrees with the electoral vote . 
  that should * not * happen . 
  electoral voting and fptp produces a 58 % . 
  that 's laughably low . 
  they 're from barcelona though : /, 
   that argument would have a basis if no . 
  the argument ** has ** basis . 
  fptp and electoral colleges are retarded . 
  can you think a little bit bigger than clinton and trump ? 
  it 's not hard to . 
   yeah 3 densely populated cities should totally decide who becomes president of half a continent , disregarding the vast majority of states that disagree with the decision . 
  electoral vote is ** not ** a state vote  . 
  you can win the election without winning the majority of states . 
  did it work ? 
  `` milk left in the heat curdles '' . 
   aka why you should hate russians . 
  we should n't hate russians . 
  we should completely remove them from any international treaty , meeting etc. 
  and saction their asses off because they [ reneged on an agreement they signed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) . 
  that is absolutely inadmisible . 
  put yer us fair back buddy to not confuse people . 
  sarcasm , like it or not , does not translate well over text, 
   whatever , `` whataboutism '' , but we hear about russia every single day while little attention is paid to these openly neo-nazi groups marching around cities in ukraine . 
  here 's the thing bub , russia ** reneged ** on an agreement it signed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances what / u/freegeeks says is serious business . 
  what you 're saying is well sucky but on global scale of events pretty pointless . 
  clinton 's winning the popular vote by 1.7 million now ... fptp and electoral colleges are the most retarded thing ever . 
   lol , and you 've been providing insight after insight ? 
    muh currency quite relevant comment . 
  you show your british debating skills . 
   germany wow germany has had better growth ? 
   spain , portugal , finland , and france arent the only members . 
  you mean spain , italy , france , portugal , finland and greece , cyprus ? 
  we could also lump in belgium . 
  yeah .
