  the eurozone is n't just about 60 % of its population . 
  i 'll stop talking here because once again you 've reached your limit and you 're looping the same comments . 
  cheers . 
  one of the largest aerospace , 4th largest pharma group , largest euro insurance group , 2 of the largest euro banks ... we 'll survive ... 
   other countries have managed decent - solid growth . 
  yes . 
  spain , portugal , finland ... 
  they 're doing smashing ... look at romania and poland ... they 're so keen to join the euro . 
  http://www.curs-valutar-bnr.ro/curs-valutar-mediu-lunar-2007 * 1 euro = 3.1 ron may 2007 * 1 euro = 4.5 ron today that 's ** 50 % ** . 
  i 'll let you do the math and figure out if having control of your currency helps or not . 
   there are other countries in the eurozone that have performed like such a festering turd what are you talking about exactly cuz am confused, 
   the average growth rate in france over the last 10 years is less than 1 % . 
  if france had the ability to control its currency uk and france would have the same growth . 
   not sure why the uk keeps getting brought up though , why are we talking about thatcher ? 
  if france implements the thatcherite reforms fillon wants to implement , i expect a frexit in 20 years . 
  again look at the relative poverty between fr and uk . 
   considering the low levels of growth . 
  uk is n't exactly cruising by with 3 % growth is it ? 
   and i doubt that the up and coming new automated enterprises will choose france good job on missing the point buddy . 
  it 's not about picking france . 
  it 's about france being the correct model . 
  unless you think brexit and trump election are wonderful events that show how sturdy those two countries are . 
  is that what you 're trying to say ? 
  france has many problems , but for all its problems we still did n't go full retard . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  i that okay ? 
   i mean , you think sarkozy was elected on an economic program or on a `` french identity restored '' program ? 
  you mean the `` french identity restored '' `` we 're all gauls and eat french fries '' that did n't even make it past ** the primary ** ? 
  the guy that got * half * the votes of fillon , that in * his own party * only convinces 1 in 5 people to vote for him ? 
  yeah `` french identity '' totally works . 
  we 're actually the future . 
  french economy exports goods that are high added value . 
  because of that we have one of the highest productivity rates in europe ( higher than uk ) http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_395943.pdf in a future of high automatisation , be ready for high unemployment . 
  it will be a future of few workers that have extremely high productivity and added value . 
  you will need a strong social net to reduce inequalities : http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=en and people willing to contribute to them ( not like some border jumpers that get paid in one country and move to another to pay as little taxes as possible ) . 
  or we can go the thatcher route . 
  reduce the social net , reduce the number of govt employees ( teachers , doctors , police ) and wonder why in 20 years we 'll have a frexit . 
  because you remove teachers from shitty areas and not paris ( london ) ... lo and behold it 's those people that vote fn ( brexit ), 
  for all our unemployment , we 're not doing that poorly in terms of inequality http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=en, 
   they still show the direction its headed . 
  and they did show it well . 
  before the primary fillon was predicted to come on top , jupp\u00e9 second and sarko 3rd . 
  it also correctly predicted jupp\u00e9 crashing badly . 
  the only thing not predicted : sarko crashing as well . 
   fter all , most of eastern europe is in the eu , only ukraine and belarus are not . 
   but his pro-eu proposals wo n't happen . 
  i can see the military proposals happen most definitely . 
   a week ago fillon was polling third , at 20 % , for the primaries . 
  and right before the election ? 
  http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/2016/11/15/25001-20161115artfig00384-un-sondage-donne-francois-fillon-vainqueur-de-la-primaire-de-la-droite-et-du-centre.php oh that 's right he polled as coming on top . 
  guess we 'll ignore that and start bitching about how polls are unreliable . 
   sure , there are nuances . 
  but the essence is the same . 
  yeah ... that 's what i do when i do n't understand an issue and try to act like a know-it-all . 
  i pretend all things are at their core similar . 
  pizza and pot-au-feu ? 
  just meat and veggies !, 
   london terrorrists . 
   getting a job because of connections / networking despite lacking the experience / qualifications . 
  are you comparing a model that has ** no ** connection with diplomacy with a yale graduate with family former ambassadors ? 
  really man ? 
   it 's also not really relevant what his father did . 
  yeah we all know that family does n't matter when you network . 
   the us ambassdador before that among other things was known for having `` served as ceo of wildbrain where he won a bafta award as executive producer of the hit tv series yo gabba gabba ! '' . 
  you could have also said that he graduated from yale , his father was ambassador to ghana . 
  but i guess it 's better to mention stuff that is n't relevant . 
   eat a dick wankstain , you seem to be mentally unstable . 
  http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/banana-republic do you understand that words can gain different meanings ? 
   pr\u00eatre added that an investigation had been launched in order to determine the motivations behind the parents ' name choice . 
  that 's a different topic and of course you turd nugget . 
  we just arrested 7 people planning a terrorist attack . 
  we sent this year 20 people to jail for planning terrorism attacks , we had 200 + people die in the last 2 years killed in terrorist attacks . 
  and you have someone naming their kid after a terrorist that killed 7 people 4.5 years ago . 
  you start an investigation . 
  country thinks person who bangs president of another country would make a great ambassador . 
  nope . 
  banana republic, 
   in all honesty , you might have a better time convincing me that this is n't about bigotry and islamophobia you would n't believe how little i care about your opinion . 
   launching an investigation to find out why some muslims named their kid mohammed . 
  what investigation ? 
  the judge said he needs a new name . 
  case done and over . 
   go find other brave battles to fight on the web, 
  wow you 're a huge perv . 
  stop checking the websites of minors : s. fuck me i need a shower, 
   so are richard durn and eric borel , have those combinations been prohibited ? 
  go check all cases . 
  i 'm not here to do your job, 
   how likely is it , that the french government would ever keep people from naming their kid `` marie '' ? 
  as long as the name has a resonance with the public . 
  merah happened friggin 4 and a half years ago . 
  people have n't forgotten . 
   have the names leopold , borel , \u00c9ric , richard , etc. 
  been recently blacklisted the same ? 
  are you daft or something ? 
  mohammed is n't black listed . 
  mohammed merah is a terrible name for a child . 
  now go mind your own business . 
   an ambassador is essentially just a line of communication . 
  and in 4/8 years when trump will be out the door , how relevant will ivana be to the new administration ?
