  but all is moot , a president does n't change ambassadors when they start their term and anti-nepotism laws might very well apply . 
  they were created by nixon cuz jfk appointed rfk . 
   after that some of our politicians said that she could be a good choice for us . 
  is th\u00e9 czech republic becoming a banana republic ? 
  what 'll happen in 4 years or god forbid 8 when trump leaves office ? 
  ivana 's only skill is having screwed trump . 
  and as great as that might be , that does n't make one a diplomat . 
  it takes time to build a relationship with an ambassador that 's why usually they 're not really changes when new presidents start their term . 
  in 4/8 years you 'll have to ask the us to change your ambassador cuz you 'll friggin have a model as ambassador when the administration changed and her skill of sucking trump off will be irrelevant . 
  not to mention that anti-nepotism laws means the he probably can not nominate her . 
  it 's like people stopped thinking or something . 
   it is the victims that matter , not the perpetrators . 
  yeah i 'm sure you know the names of the victims of raf attacks or of the victims of recent terrorist attacks in germany . 
   the discussion is about selective prosecution do you have proof it 's selective prosecution ? 
  or do you think it is because it 's the only case you ever heard about ? 
   i also do not know how well known mohamed merah is in france though well try some analytical thinking . 
  if someone kills a few soldiers , shoots up a school full of toddlers ( 7 people 3 children in total ) , grabs a little 7 yo girl by her hair and fucking shoots her in the head , you 'd probably remember who that cocksucker is . 
  photo and story cuz the victims deserve to be remembered : http://www.rtl.fr/actu/pourquoi-ont-ils-laisse-mehra-tuer-ma-petite-fille-7745860394 so yeah , we know who merah is . 
   all of these are famous internationally . 
  good thing the story happens in france . 
   merah is not known that well outside of france i think . 
  good thing the story happens in france . 
   if you go around here on the streets i am pretty sure the vast majority could not tell you who the guy is . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5e49ut/french_authorities_intervened_to_prevent_parents/da9srh7/ good thing this story happened in france . 
  just like you know who baader and the other person are , we know who merah is . 
  of course we wo n't know who baader is , nor will you know who merah is . 
  but i do n't go assuming that you people never heard of munich or baader group . 
  you 'll have to remove you for this younion . 
  some retarded shit about ireland being west england or something . 
  not really funny at all, 
   i simply can not openly assume ill-intentions by the people doing so . 
  it is not about ill-intent but about the child not suffering undue hardship . 
   our state does not play the nanny when it comes to things like this yeah ... it played wtf !, 
   i did not know who mohamed merah was do you know who osama bin laden , al baghdadi , or ask your parents if they know who baader-meinhof are or why munich 72 is a significant date . 
  come back to us with the results . 
  cheers , 
   the interpretation and grouping of results of this type is as much an art as a science , so the results involve the analyst 's own judgement ** next ** news story cuz this i 'll safely ignore . 
  if it were the uk flag , you could n't have gotten it [ out of the box ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dludxistcuo ), 
  hey . 
  i do n't disagree . 
  just stating that fn did n't exist in the 50s . 
  if fillon implements his program ( or jupp\u00e9 for that matter ) , i 'll expect a very high score for le pen in 22 if the left does n't produce a candidate . 
   the fn has had support from neo-nazis since the 50 's fn was founded in the 70s though . 
  [ mmm , ratatouille !, 
   i was n't talking about collateral/accidental deaths russians do n't know they 're constantly bombing hospitals ? 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
   i was talking about overthrowing secular leaders and funding corrupt wahhabi islamists like the saudi savage royalty . 
  there are many baddies out there from north korea , to saudi arabia to assad or kadirov . 
  history has shown us it 's not a good idea to invade countries . 
  their own citizens should do it by means of revolution . 
  sadly now the citizens of syria are being bombed by assad and we think that that does n't increase radicalism ... ha !, 
   french people tend to say more they are against something than others . 
   oh , and having jungles around the country is not `` steering away from the refugee crisis '' what jungles ? 
  :d oh man memories and such as . 
  still love how she talks about the iraq . 
  must think the definite article is part of the official names of countries . 
  the usa , should also be the france , the italy , the iraq . 
   please consider sterilisation and in the meantime practise proper use of condoms aww . 
  you especially salty today :d . 
  well you sound salty . 
  sup buddy ? 
  missing our na ? 
  for 20 + years we do n't hear a peep from you hungarians about sarkozy and his roots , now when finally the bomb has been dismantled you start showing up . 
  wtf ? 
   i would have liked him a lot better but the way he acts 99 % of the time makes him pretty unlikeable . 
  so sarkozy would be likeable if he were n't sarkozy ? 
  c'mon this is a man who has such a huge inferiority/superiority complex that will get in an insult match with a poor schmuck at an agriculture fair . 
  that will sit on a little pedestal so he 'll seem taller compared to bush . 
  that has a friggin fascination with money and bling . 
  i mean hollande is kinda full and boring but at least there are stories of him being a funny dude and shit . 
  sarkozy , i ca n't imagine him in what scenario he 'd be funny . 
  he 's married to a brit if that helps ? 
  [ what of it ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_law_%28legal_system%29#/media/file:map_of_the_legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png ) do you wan na start a debate on metric too ? 
  c'mon , i dare you !, 
   france after frequent terrorist attacks yeah http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35088276 fn lost : /, 
   is there any other kind ? 
  yeah . 
  the guy that spread the civil code across europe ? 
  who took a country that was almost in ruins after a bloody revolution and conquered almost all of europe ... 
   of course nobody is perfect but she has clearly governed germany better than hollande has governed france for example . 
  that 's not the topic here . 
  / u/journo127 is claiming that only germany has level headed politicians which is absolutely ridiculous . 
  hollande is very level headed too . 
  he managed to steer france away from the refugee crisis that hit germany , austria , sweden . 
   yes , airbus , because that 's what military solidarity means , buy french or at best german . 
  dude , i wo n't bother reading your stupid circlejerks if you do n't stop . 
  the a400m is assembled in friggin ** spain ** . 
  you should know that , you 're spanish yet your stupid circlejerk clogs your logic . 
   france does n't have to buy from any other country . 
  anti french circlejerk . 
  the ** main rifle will be [ german ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/08/30/breaking-next-french-infantry-rifle-german-heckler-koch-reportedly-wins-french-aif-rifle-competition/ ) ** replacing the iconic famas . 
  stop the anti-french circle jerk , it makes you sound pathetic . 
   italy blocked new sanctions for russia https://www.ft.com/content/1cd7f7dc-9730-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b  spain spain : russia sanctions beneficial to no one . 
  https://euobserver.com/foreign/127940 you 're fucking spanish are n't you ? 
   portugal http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/russia-counts-on-eu-friends-to-avert-further-sanctions/  britain , france , poland , sweden , denmark , the czech republic , lithuania , latvia and estonia have pushed for tougher sanctions on russia while italy , greece , cyprus , bulgaria , luxembourg , austria , spain , portugal and malta have been among the most reluctant eu states . 
  i 'll block all your next comments because frankly i do n't have the time to prove how much shit you constantly talk . 
  dude , do n't bother . 
  i tried that avenue on these people but they 're still talking about some mysterious pivoting or whatever . 
   he wants european migrants quotas .
