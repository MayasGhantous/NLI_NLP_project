  that 's very clear on his pledge.hard to do that without borders for us . 
  dude can you give me the quote in french . 
   he does n't want to create any kind of european strategical aims for all europeans and all the eu countries , only to get the rest of the eu aligned to the interests of the french nation state . 
  that again you are inventing . 
   sorry but i remember perfectly how french state solidarity worked on steelmakers , or trains or . . pretty much everything.we anti-french circlejerk which i can very safely ignore . 
  eu military cooperation involves any type of military cooperation centered on airbus and co. 
  planes , satellites , launchers , radars etc. 
   we wo n't buy made in france tm over our own or the cheaper american while france keeps being a protectionist country you sound like poland . 
  i can safely ignore your comment . 
  france has always had very generous offers exchaging tech info etc. 
  the us only exchanged a bit of tech info so another anti-french circlejerk which i can safely ignore . 
   he just wants that like ecb gave preferential treatment to deutsche bank french ones can also have it . 
  i have no idea what that means . 
   what fucking bridge?they hate us.they want to invade the countries of some of us , dismember others , isolate some so they can be easy pickings . . this is easy , it 's not a us/russia split , it 's a europe/russia one.france should decide if they prefer us or the russians.but like ukraine , you ca n't have both . 
  you sound ** very ignorant ** of the way europe sans uk has carried its policies ... 
   the very title is a eurosceptic pledge.then he goes on about how proud he is about being antimaastritch . 
  which was hardly a large success . 
   - so he wants borders for european migrants ** where ** is that , cuz i can not see it . 
   - he just wants that when france has to do something in mali there are more european countries ready to collaborate.i 'm not against that but that 's clearly not pro eu military . 
  that 's ** clear common ** eu military policies . 
   he also wants us to buy from the french defense industry did you bother reading what he wrote ? 
  emphasis * his * . 
  he wants to create a european solidarity of the military industry . 
   he also wants us to buy from the french defense industry that 's not what he said . 
   he 's against democratizing the eurozone , and against new treaties.he just wants france to be on the same level as germany and bully the rest of us you 're making stuff up . 
   - long term all dead or something like that.we already heard that thing about the long term in 2004 , and in the 08-09 , and in 2011 , so do it or stop with the virtue signaling you 're shifting the goal post . 
  it 's his fucking policy , when jupp\u00e9 does ** not ** want a common fiscal policy . 
   ull on eurosceptic pro russia stance that 's a classic french policy . 
  we want to bridge the gap between russia and the us . 
  we 're in the middle . 
   did i miss anything ? 
  yes , that on european matters he 's just the same as jupp\u00e9 . 
   there 's nothing the left hates more than egomaniacal failed napoleons . 
  hollande is the opposite of this . 
   e admires thatcher.thatcher.in france . 
  you probably do n't understand france . 
  in france ** we love ** strong men . 
  from the sun king ( though that is a bit far ) to napoleon and de gaulle and finishing with mitterrand . 
  we love strong men , we 're disappointed by those who want to act tough but fall short ( sarko ) . 
  fillon is much less of an egomaniac , he 's clean , if he plays the de gaulle card , he 's a shoe in . 
   the vitriol with which every politically savvy leftie despises him online is probably misleading . 
  in the case of sarkozy , it is * underestimated * . 
  the hate is real , deep , permanent . 
  there 's nothing the left hates more than egomaniacal failed napoleons . 
  for us champagne , for you , sparkling wine . 
   fillon is eurosceptic , au contraire than sarkozy , i do n't see anything to celebrate not really , no . 
  https://www.fillon2017.fr/europe/ * triple the budget of frontex * expulsion out of schengen for non eu foreigners that commit crimes that require that * deeper military investement with europe and uk even after brexit and hits of larger eu military cooperation * eurozone govt authority that would manage the eurozone economy * ** on the long term a common euro fiscal policy ** with common debt * no ttip , stricter with china regarding dumping and maybe remove sanctions on russia , anti us stuff * remove certain ( unmentioned ) competencies from the eu commission while enhancing others . 
   i do n't think he was outspoken on the gay marriage issue for example he said he 'd rewrite it , till very recently but the kinda changed his views . 
   le pen was like `` yay to secularism !, 
  no religious symbols on public ground ! '', 
  that 's just bs and trying to put some varnish on a turd . 
  besides the nice one liners , she compares some idiots praying in the streets with the nazi occupation ... and her party has a ton of racists . 
  he is hated because he is the cheating , lying politician by definition . 
  he was absolutely hated because of his megalomania and the fact that he ruled by polls . 
  if the polls said he should say a and b and not c , he 'd praise a and b and shit on c . if the next day polls showed c is okay but not a and b , he 'd change opinions again . 
  towards 2010 and up to now , his main strategy has been to siphon off votes from the extreme right but it no longer works ... 
  he lost the votes of the center-right and the absolute hate of the left . 
  and in terms of actual policies , yeah . 
  for example in 2012 he passed a decree saying that any foreign student who does n't find a job in 6 months , has to leave the country . 
  dude , it 's not like anyone was expecting fillon to get 42 % and jupp\u00e9 27 %, 
  i wan na see the participation at the second round of the primaries :d . i predict far fewer . 
  no to demagogues , no to two-faced politics , no to ruling by polls . 
  okay . 
  he 's a completely clueless dude , that thinks way way way too highly of himself . 
  he think he is a sort of messiah of truth and virtue / also he was the useful idiot sarkozy used on french media to justify bombing libya and since he 's been touring conflict zones like ukraine , tunisia , syria to spread the message of democracy , peace , freedom and other crap . 
  the joke is basically how clueless he is , going to areas where absolutely no one knows him and does n't belong or the fact that he never expressed remorse for the war in libya . 
   there most likely will be an anti-fn coalition that will form , something that does n't exist in us politics . 
  that 's the thing . 
  the us did n't know how to react to trump . 
  they were caught as a deer in headlights . 
  in france we do . 
  like it or not , the gang bang on fn works . 
   hmmm , people quite literally said trump was `` impossible '' during first round . 
  lets present the facts . 
  trump : * backed by one of the two biggest parties in the us and represented all right wing voters * us has fptp electoral and winner takes all at state level systems * lost the popular vote * he 's completely new to polls and us has very low turnout : 50 % le pen : * backed only by the 3rd largest party , she 's blocked by the right wing and the left wing votes . 
  * france has a 2 round system so she ** has ** to win 50 % +1 votes ( the popular vote ) * she 's well known to polls , she already ran in 2012 so she does n't really have many tricks up her sleeve . 
  an archbishop is hardly a remarkable person that had massive achievements ... we still do n't know if god is real . 
   squares are named of earnt this honor based on their achievements and work that contributed to the country 's development and improvement as whole . 
  do you live in europe ? 
  because sometimes it 's just some random dude or another . 
  like an archbishop or whatever . 
   and those rights have been given to them over time through the courts . 
  i 'll quote trump here : ** wrong ** . 
  in germany couples can not have joint adoption . 
   it 's at best a distraction from far more important political areas . 
  that 's right . 
  equal rights for everybody does not matter . 
   i do n't see who the fuck mentioned oettinger here . 
  i do n't see who the fuck mentioned le pen here . 
   it has nothing to do with nationalism , and a lot to do with realism . 
  what 's your brand of realism ? 
  that your own country is supreme while others have shitty politicians ? 
   and there are more important things than gay marriage , what would those be ? 
  austerity ? 
  the refugee crisis ? 
  well it 's good to see that those have been handled so so well . 
  children should only speak when spoken to . 
  now move along child . 
  https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_de_sondages_sur_l'\u00e9lection_pr\u00e9sidentielle_fran\u00e7aise_de_2017 fillon has her * consistently * beat by 60 % -40 % . 
  who gives a shit about the first round .
