  we 're not fptp . 
  nope . 
  / u/journo127 meant that hollande and sarkozy were some type of crazy presidents or some other type of bs . 
  what 's your beef with hollande . 
  at least we have gay marriage ... 
  try it some time . 
  it 's the 21st century . 
  and i fail to see how your idiot oettinger is better than sarkozy . 
  stop being a nationalistic idiot . 
  it does n't usually go well for germans that play that card . 
   le pen ... well she has n't done anything so it 's not like people ca n't hold it against her sh dabbled in fraud of eu funds http://m.20minutes.fr/politique/1952383-20161031-soupcons-emplois-fictifs-ue-reclame-339000-euros-marine-pen, 
   le pen appeals to former socialist voters by promising to rebuild france 's industrial base outside the euro and eu . 
  and the thing that makes her appealing to the poor also makes her unappealing to the older voters . 
   it 's not a coincidence that she is polling well on an anti-immigration and anti-islam platform . 
  so why are jupp\u00e9 or fillon polling better than le pen : /, 
  yeah . 
  we were told that in dec 2015 . 
  fn still lost . 
  : / it 's almost like people do n't just go : argh damn musleeems !, 
   it came as leading french philosopher bernard-henri levy hahahahhahaha :d . 
   whomever writes that turd of a title it 's a turd of an article  it came as leading french philosopher bernard-henri levy, 
  til the world = us , germany and russia . 
  the most widely read newspapers are le figaro and le monde , dailies with 300k for each . 
  they 're normal newspapers . 
  there 's stuff like closer and voici which is celebrities crap . 
  they 're weekly , 300k for each . 
   are you this attached to having a safe space ? 
  now talk about bisounours or bleeding heart liberalsand leftards . 
  you got ta remain consistent . 
   which has a circulation of 300,000 . 
  minute has a circulation of 40,000 . 
  dude can you read ? 
   none of them can shift election results . 
  hahahahahaha . 
  haha . 
  hahahahahaha . 
  will they make le pen be supported by ump because that 's the only way she 'd get elected . 
  fn is only the 3rd largest party in france . 
  the republican party is one of the behemot parties in the us . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_de_sondages_sur_l'%c3%a9lection_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_fran%c3%a7aise_de_2017#sondages_du_second_tour she does n't look too hot , 
   le figaro is a hoax outlet , dude ... why do n't you go back to t_d . 
  it 's your place there , you 'll be happier  back there people like you do believe that right wing = far right . 
  people there are like you , they believe breitbart is n't far right . 
  people there believe like you that main stream media is a hoax . 
   breitbart will have no competition as a right-wing news outlet . 
  finally . 
  they 'll compete with minute and valeurs actuelles ( which has 1/3 of the circulation numbers of le monde ) . 
  how do you define a tabloid ? 
  we do n't have anything like daily mail but we do have celebrity gossip stuff . 
   le figaro is the faux-right it 's owned by dassault , ** senator of the largest right wing party in france ** . 
   le monde , is left-wing . 
  by the same logic , le monde is faux left . 
  and it 's not . 
  it 's a center , somewhat left leaning newspaper . 
  ** stop ** trying to define right wing = far right . 
  breitbart is far right . 
   breitbart did nothing wrong though . 
  breitbart invented news stories https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitbart_news#acorn_undercover_videos, 
   unsc permanent member seat check my flair . 
  breitbart is a ** news ** network not a website . 
  and heck you can go to jail if you check islamist websites so the `` it 's on the internet so no one can know '' rhetoric does n't work . 
   right-leaning journalism . 
  do you know anything about the journalistic landscape of france ? 
  you have right wing conservative papers like le figaro , you have papers that straddle the right wing/far right line like valeurs actuelles and you have far right news papers like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minute_%28french_newspaper%29 breitbart wo n't do anything new . 
  and if they continue their practices as in the us , they can expect large fines . 
   call them racists , call them idiots yes , let 's ignore that at every election fn always manages to present lists of people that made racist , xenophobic , antisemitic , antiarab etc rants here 's a map : http://www.liberation.fr/apps/2015/03/carto-fn/, 
   then why invite bigoted people to your country ? 
  we ca n't exactly remove visas for us citizens . 
  though if trump scraps cop 21 agreement , i 'll favour a high tax on american products, 
  why do you think you hate each other this much ? 
   please point a country in europe . 
  that 's kinda common in europe . 
  disraeli in uk as pm ( ok old but i 'm sure our british friends can help better ) , lauren fabius in france as pm and a ton of other positions ( economics minister , foreign affaires minister , president of the national assembly ) , moscovici as foreign affairs minister and other stuff , cop\u00e9 interior minister and other stuff , dsk economy minister . 
  sarkozy president of france father was born jewish . 
  so if you wan na point a country -  france . 
  next time he should dress up as a jew . 
  big nose , curly hair , act all greedy . 
  shut your filthy whore mouth !, 
  someone is finally thinking of the children !, 
  balearic coast would be the shit !, 
   the uk pretty much defined the single market til delors was british . 
   brexit maybe ? 
  say what now ? 
  uk left because it had no business being in the eu . 
  cameron promised massive reforms , he went to brussels , he went to berlin , he went to paris , what did he get ? 
  basically 0 . 
  the eurosceptics were saying uk will lead the countries that want less of europe . 
  it will be the counter balance to france-germany in the eu leading countries like denmark and netherlands to claw back sovereignty from brussels . 
  who much of that was achieved ? 
  uk was a drag to the eu and eu was a drag to uk . 
  it did n't achieve much in the eu , it did n't make this group of countries change direction , it became more and more isolated . 
  if you want to put all that on juncker . . my oh my , for a guy that ruled a country of 300k people , he sure had a ton of power . 
   trump is an enigma wrapped in a mystery smothered in shit and enveloped in turd, 
  then why not forbid polling ? 
  i 'd love to turn in anyone that contacts me by phone or anywhere in the street . 
   since ruling out a points-based system for screening people heading for britain in september , may has said little new on controlling immigration yet we 're told constantly by brexiters on this thread that uk will become the next australia ... 
  difference ? 
  in what way ? 
   say valls would own the primary though https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/primaire_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_socialiste_de_2017#sondages not really no . 
  it seems too close to tell if he goes head to head with montebourg .
