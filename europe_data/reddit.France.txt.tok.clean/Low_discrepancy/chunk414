   endless wave of mistrust against the country that in not 20 years went ** completely against ** [ memorandums it signed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) ? 
  we 're a pathetic bunch to be skeptical against such a trustworthy partner !, 
   `` damn uk '' `` oh france is the good guys here '' i 'm happy you can look at the shit your people started in iraq and think : we did good !, 
   how about france pushing for syria ? 
  you mean isis , the result of you people destabilising iraq , booting the ba'athist that became the skeleton of isis ? 
  yeah someone has to fix your fuck ups . 
   glass houses have no excuse to be blinded by jingoism ? 
  that 's the thing , i 'm not hindered by the stupidity of blind patriotism . 
  try it , might see the world in a different light, 
  maye we 'll have free energy !, 
   what 's even more costly for politicians is cutting other areas to make room for military spending . 
  in today 's revanchism ? 
  not really , no . 
   but again , lives of soldiers are cheap in comparison it 's very costly in political capital : see war in iraq , afghanistan , vietnam, 
  how about uk stop starting shit in : * afghanistan * iraq * lybia weird how the amount of retarded wars countries start is * inversely * proportional to their `` defense '' budgets . 
   nato countries were not obliged by nato to participate in afghanistan ( and the alliance included some non-nato countries and some nato countries were absent ) . 
  not participating in afghanistan would have weakened the alliance and make it seem it had divergent interests when one of their own was attacked . 
  they all went it together and they showed unity . 
  see two can play this bullshiting game , 
  you 're bitching that romania is asking for troops to defend it . 
  but forgetting when romania sent troops in a war it had no business fighting , you forget that romanian soldiers died in afghanistan and iraq , one time for nato , one time for your retarded coalition . 
  and spain ? 
  how about the 190 people that died because spain was in a war it had no business being ? 
  i love how war just becomes accounting . 
   it 's orders of magnitude easier to deploy some troops to sit around in a low intensity conflict how many died in that easy conflict . 
  you know how much they got ta invest , do you know how many people they 've wasted ? 
  weird how people know how much they 're owed but never how much they owe . 
   this has nothing to do with nato . 
  we 're talking about `` commitment to defend '' which is the principle you were casting doubt on . 
   the purpose of nato is to ensure that nobody needs to die . 
  well you dropped the ball in afghanistan . 
  how many soldiers from `` countries that are not committed to defend '' die in that nato clusterfuck ? 
   i 'm not aware of spain or belgium asking for troops did uk ask for romanian troops in your retarded iraqi war ? 
  ** yes ** yes you did . 
   but that commitment is harder if countries do n't seem to be interested in funding their own defence . 
  i wonder how those countries not `` committed to their own defence '' felt when they joined your retarded crusade in iraq ... 
  were they committed then and stopped being committed now ? 
  how many british soldiers have died defending romanian interests and how many romanian soldiers have died defending us+uk interests . 
  you being from a country `` committed to the defence '' of these poor eastern european nations , you should rank pretty high , right ? 
  yeah i agree with that view . 
  just shitty times and a shitty place to be located . 
   `` obama created so many jobs that now i have 3 of them . '', 
  [ uniquely american !, 
  that 's fantastic !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kijo-dwe1jg )  but not near as good as the numbers make it seem . 
  of course not . 
  but i mean context man . 
  would you rather be spain ? 
  you just have to tell yourself that what sarkozy decides in the morning , he does a 180 by afternoon when new polls are out and by evening he does another 180 in the friggin plane perpendicular to the original one . 
  this guy will find friggin riemannian manifolds in very high dimensions only to be able to contradict himself with his previous statements ... just cuz the polls say something . 
   in 2008 unemployment was at 5 % . 
  oh god . 
  http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm unemployment in dec 2008 ( he took office in jan 2009 ) was at 7.2 % . 
  in one year it went up 50 % . 
  it was rapidly increasing . 
   he returned unemployment to normal levels ** wrong **  cost of spending more money than every other president combined ** wrong ** . 
  obama added 6.5 trillion to the debt of us , bush added 5.8 trillion https://www.thebalance.com/us-debt-by-president-by-dollar-and-percent-3306296 when bush came to power , he had 5 trillion of debt . 
  is 5 + 5.8 - 6.8 larger or smaller than zero ? 
  bush increased the debt by 100 % , obama by 65 % even though obama had to deal with ** the worst crisis in 80 years ** . 
   still barely returned to 2008 levels . 
  ** wrong **  had eurocentric foreign policy so europe loves him . 
  again you 're * wrong * . 
  see obama 's [ asian pivot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_asian_foreign_policy_of_the_barack_obama_administration ) . 
  wow , you got everything wrong today , amazing !, 
   they could have stopped the world war right then in 1939 . 
  yes because that 's how war works . 
  when germany had only poland to fear , france and uk could totally have attacked considering that france had a defensive strategy in mind ... maginot line anyone ? 
   the so called `` betrayal '' - which i do not describe in such terms myself - usually refers to being abandoned to imposed communism , rather than being rewarded for winning the war . 
  betrayal means  breaking or violation of a presumptive contract , trust , or confidence i fail to see what trust or obligation the allies had towards romania . 
  towards poland , yes , but towards romania sadly i can not see it . 
   france and ( part of ) germany were lucky enough to be on the side of the continent that was invaded by the allies . 
  france was also a country that declared war on germany because they invaded poland . 
  nobody forced france to do that , but promises were made by uk and france and they had to be respected . 
   too bad obama was a lot more talk than action . 
  you mean the guy that cut unemployment in half even though he had to manage and did a fucking great job managing the worst crisis in 80 years ? 
  that guy ? 
  how is this relevant to the discussion ? 
   because of a coup in our country the moment that antonescu declared war without the king 's knowledge was there any rebellion of the people or the army because the guy started a war ? 
  no ( exception when he removed the legionnairies but that 's another story ) . 
   to gain lost territory romania also lost territory to the axis yet still fought alongside it . 
  and like it or not , romania lost that war , so it can not claim any western betrayal unlike poland that had regiments fighting with the allies and the largest resistence movement during the war . 
  there is no large romanian regiment that fought for the allies or any romanian resistence because romania was not occupied by anyone . 
  yeah ... romania lost the war . 
  what will you do with half your name in 2 weeks ? 
  wait , your flair says romanian and not polish . 
  why are complaining about western betrayal ? 
  fighting 80 % of the war for the axis then changing sides when soviet forces being invading your territory does not give you the right to claim being part of any allied effort . 
   that 's the difference between legal and decent . 
  you 43 minutes ago :  is having an opinion ** a crime ? 
  ** good bye . 
  i 'll have to go a few decades back for a politician that actually propagates conspiracy theories . 
   but sometimes the will to make it happen is lacking . 
  yeah we just spend it on cocaine and hookers ... 
  does a * privately owned * concert hall have the obligation to accept anyone ? 
  go to your local restaurant and tell them they support isis . 
  let us now the results, 
  can you stop saying that . 
  i am a man of simple tastes and simple needs . 
  and seeing people getting excited and having illusions of grandeur in their own thing bubble , i dunno , brings joy to my heart . 
  centipedes , do n't listen to him .
