  he just wants to reduce the impact and ridicule of this exceptional movement . 
  trump tapped into the rage of people that have been long time ignored by the establishment , that 's why the liberal media belittled him . 
  they feared him and the unprecedented turn out he got . 
  and just like you memed the leader of the free world into office , so can you meme le pen into the elys\u00e9e palace . 
  pepe will bring joy to the little downtrodden old women from l'aisne and eure . 
  because that 's how it works . 
  hahahahhahaha . 
  it 's so delicious seeing how ignorant the crumpets are . 
  it 's so wonderfully majestic to see them rally behind sarkozy , of all people :d . they love saying how they redpilled , how their perfect mix of critical thinking , knowledge and understanding of society/history , human relationships and intelligence etc let 's them have this very fine analysis of political landscapes . 
  i wonder why their redpill did n't help them see they 're rallying behind sarkozy . 
  the friggin master of spin-doctors and corrupt politician  ) i guess the pill was expired because it did n't help them realise sarkozy [ said hillary will win ] ( https://www.google.fr/amp/www.europe1.fr/politique/entre-trump-et-clinton-sarkozy-a-choisi-2856514 ) and declared himself her friend . 
  oh crumpets , merci pour ce moment.keep that ignorance flowing , i like how my week is starting :d, 
  are you 12 ? 
  do you think it 's a game , where a company just packs and leaves one of the two largest markets in the world ? 
  why do you think that since trump got elected , the dollar did n't take a dive ... just like the pound did after brexit ? 
  he 's just a president , he is n't kaiser of the states, 
  be ready for some simple 16 yos trying to `` uncuck '' you or something like that . 
  you 'll get the truth told to you 10 times per day . 
  and also how that fact that your sticking to your ideals and values for society somehow was the major reason trump was voted in . 
  it 's hardly a surprise , moldova has played this double game for 25 + years . 
  i mean yeah but not happily . 
  what were you doing there ? 
   ` it does n't matter who votes it kiiinda does . 
  your former prez gave out passports like he was oprah . 
  now those ethnic romanians left ... how many do you think voted in this election ? 
  [ i beg to differ ] ( http://cdn-lejdd.ladmedia.fr/var/lejdd/storage/images/media/images/politique/hollande-kazakhstan/10361394-1-fre-fr/hollande-kazakhstan.jpg ), 
  what is this madness ? 
  you 're not turkey people !, 
  stop squating . 
  outb4 `` pooping like that is gewd for your colon '', 
  having to take a dump in the middle of the night so you got ta dress up so you do n't die of cold on the shitter . 
  the toilet seat 's forever cold ... 
  ah yes . 
  forgot we 're in post-truth politics era . 
  no indoor plumbing . 
   you ca n't just say no obviously you ... wait , why ca n't you say no to that ? 
  is that something real ? 
  not the chem trails i mean . 
  ok that 's pretty darn cool . 
  now someone please make a sex tape with this vid of [ him breathing heavily ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dhok0qcs-u&amp;t=2m35s ), 
   there is no mutualness in this so called `` mutual defense '' . 
   countries like mine and greece have had numerous economic problems since 2002 are you the only countries that have had economic problems ? 
   there is no mutualness in this so called `` mutual defense '' . 
  tell that to the german troops that fought in afghanistan ( or the french ones but we fulfill our quota ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_armed_forces_casualties_in_afghanistan 57 german soldiers that died . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_forces_in_afghanistan 89 french soldiers in total . 
  show some fucking respect . 
   the usa might grow tired of it and do n't be surprised at the benevolent ally not being a blank check anymore . 
  you really do n't know french people apparently . 
   it is also comical to compare montenegro to rich countries like germany that thumb their nose at nato . 
  you are not answering any questions though . 
   countries that get admitted can work their way up to 2 % even if not doing it this very second . 
  [ here 's romania ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/romania/military-expenditure-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html ) that constantly decreased military spending * since * joining nato . 
  [ here 's the czech republic ] ( http://militarybudget.org/czech-republic/ ) that has had decreased spending . 
   there is no excuse for it other than to call it free loading . 
  listen i 'll stop talking to you because you simply can not answer 3 simple questions : * how can nato force countries to increase spending ? 
  * what magic defence landmark will we reach if each country spends 2 % like in 1990 ? 
  * why did nato accept countries that did not respect the 2 % condition when it is obvious that they wo n't increase spending ? 
  you just like to moralise and that 's fine and dandy , but i 'd rather have constructive debates . 
  cheers . 
  because nato hq is in belgium . 
  * sigh * . 
   there is a reason eu is doomed to fail and it is because all the countries are out for themselves . 
  how original . 
   anything monetary related as well . 
  like the pound/euro or pound/dollar ? 
   is your excuse for countries that do n't follow guidelines to say `` tough shit what you going to do about it ? '', 
  i am asking you , what will happen if every country hits 2 % and how can you force them ? 
  it 's a simple question ... we have obama complaining about 2 % then letting montenegro in ... montenegro spends [ 1.3 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_montenegro ) . 
  germany 1.2 % ... 
  sounds like obama and trump are grandstanding . 
   his main complaint has always been that countries should n't freeload can you please explain to me what happens when countries reach 2 % spending ? 
  why did nato accept countries that did n't qualify with those 2 % like recently montenegro , but we can probably go really far back . 
  i doubt a ton of countries that recently joined respected the 2 % condition , except poland probably . 
  it 's probably germany that could allocate more , so of they do , so what ? 
  does the us think any country would invest in projects like the missile shield in romania-poland ? 
  hell no . 
  would the world collapse if the us removes troops from germany ? 
  hell no . 
  life would go on as previously . 
  and considering that nato can not really kick out countries or whatever , it 's not a lot it can do . 
  they should try to kick out belgium though :d that 'd be funny . 
  kinda like a reverse when france kicked nato out . 
  why would you post that on / r/the _ donald man : /, 
  so why worry then ? 
  these people will be out of a job soon enough then . 
  why do you feel like your country needs to force them out of their jobs ? 
  why not let your employers do that , 
   unskilled migration , since the age of automation , is n't . 
  so in geneva , robots cut your hair and serve you dinner at the restaurant ? 
  interesting ... 
  the dude took someone 's job . 
  such a shame . 
   yes , between man and woman , the other guy actually quoted the human rights convention for you . 
  article 16 men and women of full age , without any limitation due to race , nationality or religion , have the right to marry and to found a family . 
  does it say that a man can not marry another man ? 
  why does it say men and woman and not a man and a woman ? 
  why do you think that 's the case buddy ? 
   read the fucking posts you respond to you 're being aggressive so i 'll ignore you . 
  cheers .
