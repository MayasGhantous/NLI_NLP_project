   gay marriage is n't a human right except that the right to marry is a human right, 
   in london what are you doing in london . 
  you should be in your country . 
  stop freedom of movement . 
   our cafes are often staffed by french and italians oh the frenchies are doing a bit more than that http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/218583/can-you-really-earn-more-in-finance-by-studying-at-french-universities, 
  i 'm also an idiot apologist , so i 'll forgive your remark , 
  like with anything in life , you ca n't have your cake and eat it . 
  maybe you prefer massive unemployment : like greece , spain , portugal ? 
   completely biased sources . 
  the people that survived a terrorist attack are biased ? 
  awww, 
   eurosceptism seems to be more popular with the young in france uhm ... it 's complicated because the main characteristic amogst the young is abstentionism . 
  young people do n't vote . 
   many in the svp are already willing to accept substantial economic pain to leave the free movement area , just like conservatives in the uk  alea iacta est. 
  we can only work with countries that choose to not inflict self harm in order to prove some point . 
   and offer the uk and us a better deal out of desperation . 
  why ? 
  do you have the capability to stop brexit ? 
   and how do we know that switzerland could not supply those numbers , at higher salaries ? 
  and how do we know the swiss will be able to afford the higher prices . 
  if your server needs a higher salary , that means you the costumer will have to pay more . 
  you know ... economic law . 
  also unemployment in switzerland is ** 3.2 % ** . 
  that 's too low . 
   if there were key shortages , individuals could be recruited as the need arises . 
  i am french . 
  i love [ a good guillotine ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillotine_clause ) . 
  do it :d . pull the plug . 
  maybe we 'll for the [ 1 billion euros ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-human-brain-project-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/ ) you spent for nothing . 
   he did apologize then h\u00e9 retracted the apology . 
   you know what they are ( mostly ) ? 
  doctors , dentists , bankers , executives , production managers and so on . 
  http://www.travailler-en-suisse.ch/secteurs-frontaliers-geneve-2015.html  hairdressers from annecy are n't working in switzerland . 
  looks like she is . 
  the largest number of people crossing the border for work are in restaurants , technicians , transportation , administration , manufacturing . 
  the common narrative you see here through is that trump created a massive swell of disgruntled voters . 
  he tapped into the mythical `` poor white people '' that never vote because they 're underrepresented . 
  which is utter bs . 
   the western european working class basically never uses the former , tell that to the 160k french people working in switzerland . 
   it is entirely possible to have free trade without free movement said someone from a country that hosts cern , fifa , uefa , the un . 
  if you 're perfectly fine with them not being there , why do n't we send them to a country that is more open to foreigners like germany ? 
  pretty sure germany puts way more money into cern than switzerland . 
  this is a war fought with feelings . 
  \\ #feelinglivesmatter feelings are dying and only grump can restore them . 
   what facts ? 
  here you go buddy http://m.huffingtonpost.fr/ismael-el-iraki/cher-jesse-hughes-jetais-au-concert-du-bataclan-et-tes-propos/ http://louderthanwar.com/bataclan-survivor-reacts-latest-eagles-death-metal-comments/#.v0iwej2fema.twitter at least 2 people that were at the concert saying he 's talking out of his ass . 
   the man was standing on the stage when this happened and saw it with his own eyes . 
  how the fuck can he be on stage then say oh muslims were told not to enter ? 
  what the fuck does he know ? 
  and how can he say he saw muslims celebrating in the streets ? 
  ** that 's pure and utter bullshit ** . 
   your opinion on the subject is trash . 
  listen to the ** facts ** . 
  they 're there . 
  hughes is an idiot with an agenda . 
   it unfortunately probably does , you can already see a certain sub on reddit pushing her to ` uncuck ' and ` save ' europe . 
  from what exactly i do n't know . 
  thing is , le pen does not have the senior vote . 
  while 27 % of french voted for fn in the last regional elections [ only 19 % of over 60 ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/france/2016/10/20/front-national-vieux-nous-en-gardent_1523295 ) voted fn . 
  old people are much more likely to go voting ( they pushed for brexit in uks case ) but turns out that in france saying you wan na destroy their savings ( by leaving the euro ) wo n't make you very popular . 
  and i do n't know how many old french people are in tune with pepe memes : / . 
  but hey , if 16 yos from dumbfuck tx wan na feel like they 're making a difference and wan na photoshop le pen on shit instead of doing normal teenage crap like watching porn ... who am i to judge ? 
  have a go at it buddy . 
  i 'm sure between lazy sundays spent watching michel drucker , marie-benedicte will fire up reddit and check some dank memes, 
   this will surely convince the french !, 
  as a frenchman reading your comment , i 'm happy people like you are leaving , 
   he really would have the last laugh over the eu ( that 's if he has n't had it already ) . 
  maybe they can share a toblerone . 
  they have normal gapped ones in the us , 
  yeah you can talk about [ how le pen wants to fuck him ] ( http://imgur.com/ipwolv4 ) . 
   he 's actually surrounded by geo-politicians , advisors , etc. 
  who tell him what to do ? 
  so he 's surrounded by an establishment ? 
  by people from the system that advise him ? 
  how interesting !, 
   why i do n't take your opinion very seriously . 
  you also do n't take facts very seriously . 
  i think they should wait with their analysis . 
  the reality is that trump has not done anything and on whatever subject there is , he has said everything and opposite . 
  by presenting the gloom and doom before any action he has taken , now he has the bar set really low for him . 
  in 4 years he can say `` hey they said russia was going to conquer europe and co2 emissions will be 200 times higher . 
  look , that has n't happened , we 're still here , doing * better * than what the establishment media predicted . 
   imagine in 1985 if someone told you the soviet union will fall apart . 
  or in 1915 that bolsheviks will form it . 
  or in 1912 that ww1 will be slow and draining . 
  imagine if in 1999 , [ the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/209559 ) calls germany the sick man of the euro . 
  how do you like them cherries ? 
  apparently a lot because you ca n't stop picking them !, 
   your country is big what part of `` i used to live 200m from bataclan and my former neighbors did n't say anything about what this guy mentions '' do you not understand ? 
  what part of ** people that were at bataclan say he 's full of shit ** do yo not understand ? 
   , 99.9999 % of your country only knows what the media reported . 
  ah yes . 
  media has an agenda to hide the true muslim conspiracy . 
  go back to / r/the _ donald and leave us cucks alone buddy . 
   hughes behavior can be excused no it can not . 
  he has no business spreading ** false ** information . 
  until when he finally admits he was bullshitting he can be excused . 
  until then , he should seek help from a psychologist or something . 
   he was there , after all . 
  there were other people there that contradict him http://louderthanwar.com/bataclan-survivor-reacts-latest-eagles-death-metal-comments/#.v0iwej2fema.twitter  these are things he has heard there himself , undoubtedly .
