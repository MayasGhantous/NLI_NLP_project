  ah yes . 
  undoubtedly ... obviously ...  but these are questions that people in the street have what people what streets ? 
  as a frenchman that has been many many times to paris since and has friends and family there and ** used to live 200m from bataclan ** , please inform me about ** my ** country !, 
  because my former neighbors did n't tell me the crap you 're pretending exists . 
  so tell me , inform me . 
  clearly you know better than people who actually live there and * lived * through the events . 
  was moldova ever in a `` west '' type of sphere of influence ? 
  they were always happy to take advantage of anything romania offers ( like those free 150k romanian passports ) and ignore it when they had other interests . 
  nothing new under the sun here for moldova . 
  dammit , we were so depending on moldova . 
  jupp\u00e9 will . 
  both support gay marriage now ... 
  but then again i do not have a magical ball to predict the future , do you ? 
  what does it say ? 
   and gay marriage is not a human right . 
  let 's look at the [ udhr ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) :  article 16 . 
   ( 1 ) men and women of full age , without any limitation due to race , nationality or religion , have the right to marry and to found a family . 
  they are entitled to equal rights as to marriage , during marriage and at its dissolution . 
  so marriage is a human right only if a man and a woman want to get married ? 
  that makes sense to you ? 
  can you stop peddling the bullshit that gay marriage is n't a human right ? 
  is merkel expect to stand up to le pen ? 
  well when sarkozy is more liberal than you , you probably should re-check that definition you 're using, 
   so you start with labeling me as a trump supporter ok , for you i have removed the trump comment and only kept the / r/conspiracy   then calling eodm idiots they 're idiots yeah   normally during a take over mngmnt stays put for another few months well management has decided to remain another year and has no intention of leaving . 
   i 'm done ` talking ' to you . 
  good debating the differences between owners and managers in this context is the most retarded thing ever ... well hughes is more retarded sorry . 
  fine . 
  change to managers . 
  it means jack shit . 
  ** because the same managers that hired the staff , threw these idiots out **, 
   the original owners were jews of fuck me , i opened a can of nuts apparently . 
  rancid nuts . 
  http://www.lemonde.fr/attaques-a-paris/article/2015/12/02/il-est-necessaire-de-revoir-les-portes-du-bataclan-ouvertes_4822293_4809495.html  jules frutos et olivier poubelle codirigent , depuis 2004 , le bataclan here 's an article saying that ** frutos and poubelle have been managers of the bataclan since 2004 ** # 2004 < 2015 can you like go back to ~ ~ / r/the _ donald ~ ~ or / r/conspiracy, 
   nato will slowly become irrelevant . 
  that 's what i thought until i ound that trump is in favor of some of the suff in obamacare even though during the campaign he said he 'll repeal it all in 100 days . 
  turns out populists ... do n't respect promises . 
  i shall expect tons of butthurt :d, 
  so the guy ** accuses the owner ** that his company has hired people that ** participated in a terrorist attack ** and he expects said owner to accept them with open arms ? 
  the dude 's way more delusional than i thought . 
  also if he fears the staff at bataclan , why the fuck would he try to come back . 
   willing to stand up stand up to what ? 
   equality , human rights and fundamental citizens rights so like gay marriage ? 
  it 's pretty telling when even sarkozy supports gay marriage and you do n't ... also what about : hollande , jupp\u00e9 , rajoy , renzi , the nordic countries , asutralia and canada ? 
  are they chopped liver ? 
  she supported the capital punishment . 
  not a liberal . 
   lot of left in france feel betrayed / u/m0rogfar is right . 
  we so not define liberalism by `` is the far left satisfied '' . 
   universal human values , individual rights like gay marriage ? 
  that thing ? 
   international cooperation like when she signed a refugee deal with turkey without asking anyone ? 
   to bail out greece again in 2015 , which probably should not have happeend . 
  because db would have survived without . 
  a 14 billion fine sent them to the precipice, 
  wisconsin difference of votes : 20k pennsylvania : 60k michigan : 10k iowa : 150k tally : 240k votes difference in those states . 
  voting population in the us : 240m . 
  ** 0.1 % ** of the votes decided an election because * they had too much power * . 
  trump and bush won because the system is stupid . 
  they both lost 2 times the popular vote . 
   well , let 's start with higher healthcare insurance for you after you bought food deemed not ok . 
  i fail to see how that 's a problem . 
   yet here in austria we need coins to unlock carts in the supermarkets wut ? 
  you do n't have plastic coins for that purpose ? 
   not all banks raise fees now because there is an alternative to them - cash . 
  you do realise there 's a fee with holding cash right ? 
  you should read the labels . 
  social sciences do n't atempt to fix anything . 
  they just tell you you have a problem , much like a thermometer . 
   that 's the same academia which failed to make any progress in integration of gypsies over the years and the same which gets funding for large projects like hatefree culture , which does literally nothing to make average uneducated people more tolerant but rather wages social wars against them , making them even more hateful and stubborn . 
  when you have a fever , do you break the thermometer ? 
  as a stemer , your comment is bullshit . 
  but they were not allowed to have a laugh !, 
  [ hmmm ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/131/399/fry.png?1307468855 ), 
   was literary the birth of western culture . 
  and eastern culture . 
  byzantine empire . 
  i see . 
  so it 's kinda like the soviet union that did n't announce chernobyl exploded . 
  they probably had a criminal investigation and did n't want covers to be blown . 
  for me europe stops at the volga . 
  the vast majority of jews are white , also arabs are white etc. 
  but this was n't a racial based question . 
  oh god . 
  i mentioned that little tidbit on / r/worldnews , how according to the us census jews are generally white , especially ashkenazi . 
  and this dude jumped in starting freaking the hell out how dare i tell him what he is , that he does n't feel white etc. 
  i 'm starting to think in the us people think all white people are americans . 
   are just against marriage , in general ... 
  they did n't ask about white people . 
  where is the love slovakia ? 
  just make sure it has no holes, 
  that 's kinda simplistic to say that this affair lead to revolution . 
  the flour wars were far more important for example . 
  or paris or venice or london . 
  i like down-to-earth people as much as the next guy . 
  but we 're talking about the leader of a country here . 
  someone that 's meant to lead a people , set directions , have a global vision . 
  and at least for the eu that global vision clearly is n't there . 
  by the looks of it , something really fascinating . 
  they 're all enthralled . 
  title is bit bullshit .
