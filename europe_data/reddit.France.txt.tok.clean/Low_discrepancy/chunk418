  macron already said it was bullshit that they decided to cut 5 euros . 
  i like though how the article quotes everything from huma to closer . 
   #iamtheninetyninepercent that does not know how to use \\ # on reddit ? 
  did you have a stroke or something ? 
   censorship never works . 
  when 's the last time you saw someone praying to zeus ? 
  i 'd say that in that case censorship worked pretty well . 
   i 'm not condoning this type of behaviour from management did you not understand ? 
  behaviour ? 
  what a nice euphemism for verbal abuse and violence . 
   unlike the people you 're defending i do n't get triggered by mere words . 
  wait till you get abuse at your job buddy . 
   so you 're condemning verbal violence while condoning physical violence ? 
  well the romanian justice system did n't do shit to arrest those that produced the emotional distress of the workers . 
  and the workers snapped . 
  it 's a story as old as humanity . 
   hope they got good healthcare tho, 
  so you agree that if french businesses really were that nice then we woud n't actually need strong unions ? 
  thus not making it ironic ? 
  `` i know you 're not all that bad '' . 
  is the guy a minnesotan ? 
   ironic . 
  why ? 
   so i guess in his deluded mind they should consider themselves lucky ?!, 
  neah he 's the type of shithead that when in the wrong acts twice as violent and annoying . 
   i bet they felt like `` they showed the management who 's boss '' while they were filling out their unemployment paperwork . 
  i 'd happily quote this manager 's lovely comments in this reply thread but it might get deleted . 
  do you understand the concept of verbal violence ? 
  or the concept of emotional distress ? 
  that people can snap under a constant barrage of abuse ? 
   and no , violence is never a good idea last time i 've checked verbal abuse is violence too . 
   beggars ca n't be choosers that does n't mean you can shit on a slice of bread and give it to a beggar and tell him he should be happy . 
  you 're not pc , bro . 
   the study , which took place this march , consists of more than 39,000 ratings by g8 citizens . 
  so just g8 citizens ? 
  i smell a weird bias here . 
   throwing money at a problem does n't automatically fix it . 
  you claim the romanian healtcare system has funds . 
  that 's patently false . 
  then you mention the us , where it 's a case of additional funds where marginal costs get higher . 
  a ferrari is 10 times more expensive than a renault , but it does n't drive 10 faster . 
  sure . 
  but romania does n't have a renault of healthcare , romania has a horse drawn carriage . 
  again bulgaria spends ** 40 % ** more per capita on healtcare . 
   you can do a lot with very little , if you 're driven to do it . 
  of course . 
  or you can just leave the country and move to the west and get insta-gratification . 
  so what did romanian doctors choose between grinding in a system that is severely underfunded and going to the west ? 
  https://www.romania-insider.com/reuters-nearly-third-hospital-positions-romania-vacant-country-experiences-healthcare-exodus/ damn !, 
   the funds are there , are they really ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita romania has the lowest expenditure per capita in the eu . 
  the next up is bulgaria , and the spend ** 40 % ** more . 
  how precocious of you !, 
  6 % of us electricity production goes on ac . 
  the same amount as the whole of africa for all its needs . 
  you people are really doing a number on the planet . 
   not for royalty . 
  specifically not for royalty . 
  even for royalty . 
  case in point : guy does n't want to get buried there and he wont . 
   and please , keep a proper tone . 
  and i 'd ask you to use common sense . 
  but hey ... 
   therefore it is ill-advised to accept the status quo yeah especially since it 's highly likely that a new ref would just get the same result . 
  sweden is going for optimal number of friends : one . 
   one of which is honoring our traditions . 
  it is generally considered that one 's obligations stop at one 's death . 
  grow up dude . 
  really !, 
   not without violating international law , though . 
  akshually , we never ratified that law . 
  so we can legally create apatrids . 
   i really do n't understand your motivation for being so opinionated on a subject that has no relevance to ~ ~ you ? ~ ~ anybody where a person chooses to be buried should be their business . 
  not yours , not the danish people . 
   the people of denmark are expressing their opinions if they do n't want to hear opinions on / r/europe , then they should not come on / r/europe . 
  it 's as easy as that . 
   nah fam  must be that law of jante . 
  you should understand that people are different one from another and even the same individual may change from one time to another . 
   this is getting boring well you keep shouting muh 29 trillion kronen without refusing to understand it 's a personal decision . 
   but him throwing it away because he wants to act like a baby bothers me . 
  is the queen also refusing the get buried there ? 
  again , do n't give royalty money if it bothers you . 
  where people choose to get married is none of your business . 
  if they ask for money to get buried somewhere , then you should refuse . 
  if you accepted to give the money , do n't bitch afterwards . 
  do you understand personal decisions ? 
   please tell me where to sign up . 
   does n't really solve anything at all is there anything to solve ? 
  it 's his decision and ** his only ** where to get buried . 
  there is nothing to solve . 
   all i know is this guy threw away 29 million dkk for absolutely nothing remove the monarchy then if giving money to the monarchs bothers you . 
  it 's as easy as that . 
   as far as i know , he was consulted . 
  he actively helped make the sarcophagus etc. 
    and i do n't care where i 'll get buried . 
  but this point is really dumb though . 
  he should just have said no to start with , instead of throwing 29 million away . 
  maybe the guy simply changed his mind . 
  maybe he realised he dislikes the whole thing ? 
  maybe he 'd love to get a divorce now but the situation is complicated etc etc etc.
