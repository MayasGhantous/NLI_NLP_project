  the previous agreement would have meant a buy-out by the italians . 
  and the italians want full control . 
  how is one country having full control more european than sharing control ? 
   that 's literally what the eu is . 
  yeah it is the heir of the organisation created to intermix french and german economies so much to the point that war between them will be too costly . 
   that 's what military cemeteries are for . 
  on the [ col de la madone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsnaf652bwc ) , there 's a plaque with several us and canadian soldiers that died to protect that area . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_monuments_aux_morts_de_paris#/media/file:memorial_rue_de_rivoli.jpg here 's a memorial in paris of soldiers that died during the liberation . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_monuments_aux_morts_de_paris there are in fact tons of places in paris with plaques where people died . 
  and that 's a good thing . 
  i have never visited a war cemetery . 
  but this , on the roads i walk each day , on the bike rides i take , i can see it with my eyes : people died here . 
  hitler did n't die here , stalin did n't die there , neither did molotov or eichmann or others . 
  it was common soldiers that died . 
  common soldiers like relatives etc. 
   it is more than understandable that someone in that situation wants stability in their life . 
  then they should n't have moved since may said that people that lived for more than 5 years will have permanent residence . 
  these are people that moved without ** anyone ** forcing them to . 
  they had no constraints . 
  also they lived in uk since the 90s . 
  if you want stability , you apply for citizenship . 
  if you want it to be your home , you apply for citizenship so you can vote and have your opinion heard . 
  these are just people that simply moved and that 's it . 
  or i prefer to think about the people that died even though they had no business being there , they being german , russian , polish , etc. 
  because of tyrants or whatever . 
  or you anthropomorphise armies and think they 're a homogenous being that has one mind and it a killer . 
  that could work too , really shows you have family that fought in wars against their wishes . 
   as fun and easy as you try to make it sound moving to a different country , culture and language than your own , with wife and kids the guy is married to a german chick and is moving to germany . 
  what cultural shock ? 
   i 'm not trying to sound demeaning but to me you seem like you 're quite young and do n't have too many attachments/responsibilites in life yet . 
  hold your psychoanalysis . 
  the most i 've lived in one place is 8 years , on average i 've lived 6 years in one place , and lived in 4 countries by now . 
  people are more adaptable than you think ** especially ** immigrants like these people . 
  yeah but that still means / u/piersimlaplace is thicc . 
  but a flying bird with such a large mass and brittle bones would not have any strength to do any harm . 
  a horse sized duck would stop being a flying bird . 
  an ostrich weighs 120kilos and they 're way smaller than a horse . 
  gdp growth . 
  you mean that you ** never ** had grass stains on any of your clothing ? 
  i find that very hard to believe . 
   weight , so it would be horse-sized duck you weigh as much as a horse ? 
   what happens to the pension wait , you think pensions are liveable in eastern europe ? 
  the growth is sufficient to finance the very insignificant pensions . 
   not every german soldier was nazi either , should we erase statues for them too ? 
  i do n't think it would be such an extremely evil thing . 
  people still have statues and memorials during the colonisation period . 
   soviets invaded us first and no they did n't . 
   what about those that have been in the uk for less than 5 years ? 
  what happens to them ? 
  nice goal post moving . 
  so you agree the greek moved for nothing then . 
   but they are n't better than nazis . 
  they killed around 30 million people for crying out loud !, 
  war memorials generally commemorate people that died . 
  someone that died in the liberation of auschwitz would n't have risen to the top of the gulag system and order massive killings , would they ? 
   monuments to people who raped and made us into their puppets for 50 years ? 
  that 's how you read it not how i wrote it . 
  did soviet soldiers that did not rape or kill polish people participate in the fight against nazis ? 
  no one 's telling you to put a statue of friggin stalin . 
  but there is a huge difference between ordinary soldiers that died and the rulers that fucked everything up . 
  well poland was given a shitty hand . 
  should n't the soldiers that helped poland avoid the lebensraum be remembered in some fashion ? 
   the officials say otherwise . 
    brexit : uk-eu freedom of movement ` to end in march 2019 ' did you read your article ? 
   from that date eu workers moving to the uk will have to register , at least until a permanent post-brexit immigration policy is put in place . 
  people coming after 2019 will get no special treatment for being in the eu , which makes sense . 
   where and when did she say this , exactly ? 
  google is your friend you know . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/22/theresa-may-makes-fair-and-serious-offer-on-rights-of-eu-citizens-in-uk  `` theresa may made clear to us today that eu citizens that have been in britain for five years will retain their full rights . 
  that is a good start , '' merkel told reporters . 
  honestly it 's like brexit made people irrational or something . 
  so you think lebensraum would have been better for poland ? 
  and have a memorial for that . 
  unless you think that all the russian soldiers raped all the women and poland would have been much better under nazi rule . 
   that stability is now under doubt because of brexit . 
  the rules that allowed them to stay will disappear in less than 2 years . 
  they 'll revert to normal foreigners and since they 've been living there for more than 5 years they 'll be allowed to remain . 
  that 's what may said . 
  enough with the bullshit that makes it seem like the purge is coming . 
  heck they can apply for citizenship at this point . 
  let 's stop being melodramatic . 
  they moved because they wanted to move . 
   most people want stability . 
  they have that stability since they 've lived for 5 years in uk . 
  honestly there are far worse cases to complain about than this guy . 
   and here you come telling them that they have to start over because it 's fun to `` move around europe '' ? 
  if you dislike one place , you move . 
  this is what they 're doing . 
  ** no one ** is forcing them to move , they 're doing by their own volition . 
   and should be remembered as no better than nazis . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lebensraum for all the bad things communism was , it completely pales in comparison to what the nazi plans were for poland . 
  russian soldiers should still be remembered because a lot of them died and they were n't all evil . 
  let 's remember that the worst camps like auschwitz were liberated by russian soldiers . 
  what 's with the melodramatic article and comments ? 
  this is a friggin inspirational story . 
  if you dislike one place , pick up your shit and just move . 
  greek guy is unhappy with his situation , moves to uk , meets german girl , falls in love , gets married , kids , then moves to germany where he gets double the salary . 
  i 'm supposed to feel sorry that this greek guy moved around europe and hit jack pot after jack pot ? 
  moving is one of life 's greatest experiences , and that 's the beauty of the eu , instead of just moving in your country freely , now you can move on basically the whole continent .
