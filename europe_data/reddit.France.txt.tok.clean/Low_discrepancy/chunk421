  what 's the word for the guy that comes just for the food at phd defenses ? 
  but i mean c'mon a lot of italians defend here and they pick italian caterers . 
  why did i read the youtube comments ? 
  why ? 
   long socks can be rolled up or down / u/artandmath confirmed my doubts that they 're compression socks . 
  i have yet to see anyone wear long socks and short pants because it 's cold . 
  it 's not something done here . 
  yeah i started wondering if they 're not compression socks . 
  did n't know they helped with varicose veins . 
  so when walking through the woods , you should spend all your time rolling up and down socks . 
  and do they have to be black ? 
  at least merkel is making an effort you know . 
  so she 's the risk taker in the family ? 
  * socks not fully rolled up * only one foot on the bar * not clutching on the backpack and sticks like it contains your more valuable possessions ever . 
   practical when you go hiking how is it practical to wear socks that are fully rolled up to the knee ? 
  either wear long pants if it 's cold , or wear short pants and unroll those ugly socks and enjoy the air if it 's not cold . 
  let 's just agree that black socks rolled up are ugly . 
   you are confusing figures that projected power and had great sway ( like mitterrand ) with de gaulle . 
   yet his way of governing was extremely gaullist de gaulle would have had a heart attack if he heard france taking up the euro and france signing the schengen agreements . 
  there was only one de gaulle . 
  all the other presidents that followed were simply faded ( pompidou , chirac , hollande ) or were europeists ( vge , mitterrand , macron , and to some extent sarko ) . 
  you are confusing figures that projected power and had great sway ( like mitterrand ) with de gaulle . 
   for now i oppose it , and advocate that britain , once independent , should have a policy of free trade . 
  so , they 'll remove borders with the eu ? 
  did i read a different article than you have ? 
   what other countries do or have done in the past is quite irrelevant . 
  you did not answer my question . 
  did your country have ** more ** fta before joining the eu ? 
  if not , stfu . 
   brussels has it as a policy to impose tariffs here and now , your country had the same policy . 
   it 's appalling that brussels wants to impose them . 
  so your country before joining the eu had no trade tariffs . 
  in fact , your country had ** more ** ftas ** before ** joining the eu . 
  yeah i 'll call bs on that . 
  so we agree borders suck . 
   and any american customer so aggrieved at their government standing in the way of a trade between a willing buyer and a willing seller should certainly take that complaint to washington , just as i complain that brussels interferes with my own freedom to choose what i buy . 
  considering that they just elected a guy that is going to major protectionist policies and left major trade deals like tpp , i 'm assuming that your example of american consumer is not a majority . 
   but i 'm not trying to sell them things well your countrymen are trying to sell them things . 
  pretty sure americans also have taxes if they wan na buy european . 
  well if you exclude mitterrand , you basically are left with only right wing presidents . 
  neah , mitterrand was never a huge fan of de gaulle . 
   yes because trade is the alpha and omega of all nations . 
  i dunno about you , but borders between equally developped nations suck ass . 
  they get to control their borders . 
  since when are prices on steam different from one eurozone country to the other ? 
  so yorkshire then ? 
  with a population of 5 million the should be super integrated , should n't they ? 
  it 's almost like you do n't understand the connection between commerce and being rich . 
  gibraltar is n't rich because they speak english , but because they 're in a very important region if the globe . 
  heck look at monaco , they do n't speak any english . 
   impossible if they were still speaking regional dialects . 
  so falkland islands is also fully incorporated into the global economy and prosperous ? 
   does n't matter if its english or russian or mandarin for that matter . 
  ok . go learn chinese then . 
  some related statistics . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divorce_demography 53 % of marriages in the us end on divorce . 
  55 % for french marriages . 
  my view precisely . 
  who knows why people cheat and why should i judge what happens in another person 's relationship . 
  why would you need to cheat in the netherlands ? 
  people ride bikes on cobblestone roads . 
  what forces other countries to join ? 
  is poland super bothered it has no voice in the eurozone ? 
  same for romania . 
  both these countries have not presented any roadmap towards joining the eurozone other than `` it 'll happen when it 'll happen '' so if that does n't bother them , why should future franco-german structures annoy them ? 
   t. peter 's and castel sant ` angelo any recreations ? 
  1871s people have sevran , 1940s people have compi\u00e8gne , 2017s people have / r/painting ( or whatever it was called ), 
  the majority were germans though . 
  how come there are fewer germans yet we still got our asses kicked on that drawing april 1st thing ? 
  in next weeks when you ear italy/france , dropping the h ? 
  you sure you 're not french ? 
  neah . 
  central europe . 
  paris or rome have shitty areas as well but the nice areas taper off evenly . 
  you do n't go to champs elysees to the shittier parts of paris in 300 meters . 
  well that happens in cannes . 
  you go from amazing parts to total dullness in 5 mins of walking . 
  and the really amazing parts are just two streets kept nice for the rich . 
  there 's nothing besides that . 
  whereas other cities like antibes just a short distance away is amazing . 
  it has an old historical center , streets you can walk on and want to discover etc. 
  cannes is really shit for the reputation it has . 
  did you actually read the article before commenting ? 
   `` nothing special '' is a bit different from your original `` absolutely ugly '' . 
  is this beautiful to you ? 
   we have n't had good relations with a large portion of the iranian nationalists since we helped the shah take power . 
  now at the time , this was n't terribly controversial - one absolute ruler is overthrown by someone who aspires to be an absolute ruler with the help of foreign backers - yeah mosaddegh was a total absolute leader, 
   being of different government philosophies , never helped trust either . 
  secularism vs islamic government , ect . 
  ah thank you . 
  for a small moment i thought the us would be allied to ksa . 
   he is convinced its a bad deal , and you know how he is about bad deals . 
  yeah . 
  he gets worse deals .
