   o , we should just let it burn and hold sausages on a pike over it ... at the same time forest fires are a natural event . 
  http://news.mit.edu/2013/forest-fire-management-1120 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx1xnwpsjkg shrubbery and dead shit should be allowed to burn off , if not , it just piles on and then you have mega fires . 
  24 or 60 % for me . 
  cannes is beautiful . 
  fine let 's take some examples . 
  avenue de grasse , 300m from the croisette : https://www.google.fr/maps/@43.5548466,7.0155245,3a,75y,262.66h,95.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sltxzck1bqzonrhpqd2qb5a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en wow look at this fine ass beautiful architecture . 
  avenue st jeanne , 400m from the croisette : https://www.google.fr/maps/@43.5572853,7.0146844,3a,75y,306.78h,95.84t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1swkso9c4vh983snss_iap7a!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dwkso9c4vh983snss_iap7a%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d77.503555%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en omg do n't bring any girls there , they 'll immediatly fall in love with you because it 's such a romantic place < 3 and let 's not forget what magical things you can see 100m from the second train station in cannes .

  ** ( which is my favourite game to play btw when i 'm in cannes ) . 
  edit ; the rich get the croisette , the poor , they get fucked and that is why cannes is one of the most ugly cities on the cote , because for a large part it is nothing special than any ordinary city . 
   there was/is a crisis in portugal , was n't it ? 
  and a lot of people have left portugal and moved to other countries during recent history . 
  take the french football player , gameiro . 
  not a very french surname is it ? 
  absolutely ugly city besides one or two streets . 
   i was under the impression that the original poster was citing relevant statistics , and so i replied with relevant statistics . 
  no you did n't reply with relevant statistics . 
  / u/baritbrit gave you the statistics : the results of polls . 
  you replied with the result of numerical simulations . 
  the chance to win is obtained by 538 through monte carlo simulations ** by using ** results of polls that showed that trump was behind 6 pp in the polls . 
  as you can see here : https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-users-guide-to-fivethirtyeights-2016-general-election-forecast/ you should understand what you 're talking about before criticizing others . 
  le pen has no chance to win the 2017 election , says all of the media . 
   except for his stupid remarks of grandeur he apparently made . 
  which ones ? 
   a month before the election . 
    his chances of winning . 
    were 13 % do you understand the difference between chance of winning and results in polls ? 
  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/polls.html in october the largest difference was 6 percentage points . 
  i do n't know about you , but 6 pp is n't exactly huge and impossible to gap . 
  clearly thats what / u/baritbrit meant . 
   the membership will be back on the table . 
  how can you say that . 
  the average turk is as poor as the average romanian and turkey is set to surpass the population on germany in a few decades . 
  in what kind of reasonable analysis would turkey be on its way to joining the eu even with the most democratic govt in the world ? 
  the economics are simply not there . 
  the day the average turk will be as rich as the average italian or spanish , sure we can talk , but that day is definitely not this century . 
   criminals among citizens are also outliers , well the subprime crisis was indeed a criminal activity with a ton of collusion . 
  it 's just that people are too powerful , the banks are too big to fail etc. 
   why did n't these quants and advanced modelling see 2008 coming ? 
  you mean women like brooksley born ? 
  but how do we protect ourselves from ze terrroriiiest . 
   the highest average iqs in the world . 
  why do you think our leaders will be stupid ? 
  wait you think high iq means you can not fuck up ? 
  well i think that kinda explains why the fuck up came to be . 
   but that is public information anyway , though not photos but with the prevalence of facebook that is pretty moot . 
  so everybody has a public fb account in sweden ? 
   i would still fully support this law even with a psd president . 
  better to have these checks and balances a single person ( the president ) can not be a check or balance . 
  for the vast vast majority of history , the fight has always been to take away power from the king . 
  and that has been established with the parliament . 
   i also think it helps reduce polarization what reduces polarization and increases cooperation is having a proportional system . 
  which poland oviously does n't have since 38 % of the votes got them 51 % of the seats . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliamentary_election,_2015#results having an all mighty figure decide that rules shall pass and what rules shall not does not reduce polarization ( as the us is clearly an example of ) . 
   off-topic : we need this stuff in romania . 
  your arguments seem to be that you need this because you dislike the parliament and like the president . 
  now switch it the other way round and try and imagine you like the parliament but dislike the president . 
  in the end , it should always be a matter of principle . 
  and the principle is that the parliament should always be the actual representative of the people ( provided there 's no bullshit like 38 % of votes gets you 51 % of seats like in poland , france or uk ) . 
  well since you , / u/paultheparrot and / u/arlort are against my comment , i shall need two more redditors in favour of what i said . 
  or at least one of you guys will have to change their opinion in favour of mine . 
  i 'll let you decide amongst yourselves . 
  there is no single `` this law is bad '' statement in whole article , and what i did n't include is opinions included in the original article : 2 positive and 2 negative about the law . 
  that 's how every article should be . 
  controversy around vaccination ? 
  put 2 positive comments and 2 negative ones . 
  climate change ? 
  bring 2 people in that think it 's a huge deal and two people that will deny its existence . 
  * always * the middle ground . 
  that 's the hallmark of neutrality !, 
  really wonderful city . 
  had some amazing mariscos but a shame the water had algae when i was visiting . 
   bank account = / = citizenship . 
  a bank account has the same info as a passport . 
  again you just need name date and place of birth to basically indentify a person with very high accuracy . 
   are you saying that the uk will share with the netherlands a list of people who have taken uk citizenship ? 
  it 's not exactly hidden information , top secret information etc etc. 
  these are not secret agents . 
  it is in the best interest of a country to declare when one person is a citizen of theirs since they want to extend the protection to their citizens . 
  heck in france you can freely consult list of naturalised citizens in the journal officiel . 
   the us taxes its citizens abroad but it 's up to the individual concerned to declare themselves . 
  if the us wants to find you , they will . 
  how many people with your name , date and place of birth do you know that do n't have your citizenship ? 
  the us has the soft power to demand that data from any banks that open accounts for people . 
  and in this case , it 's highly likely that eu countries will share this data with the netherlands . 
  if the us can do it . 
  average salary 3k ... :'d is that the guy that tells refugees to come to germany where they 'll get a job a house and a merc ? 
  identity and nationality are two different things . 
  yeah but it 's from their former colonies . 
   what do do with them ... do do joins us on the obscure side . 
  hijacking this post . 
  this news was already posted on / r/europe 1 year ago . 
   responsible for 0.0015 % of all carbon emissions , which , by the way , is n't even the biggest gas contributing to global warming . 
  omg just 0.0015 % for something completely useless ? 
  where can i sign up ? 
   transferring $ 1000 worth of value via a bank wire is more expensive than transferring $ 1000 worth of value via bitcoin . 
  it 's the same process , it does n't have to cost more . 
  it 's still routers sending bits up and down networks . 
  there is no reason for paypal to consume more electricity than the blockchain . 
  paypal simply has one ledger , that 's it .
