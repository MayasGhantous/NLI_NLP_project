  big shit . 
   stop pretending that money just disappears after you pay the banking fees , its exactly the same kind of naive thinking as cloth bags being more environmentally friendly than plastic ones . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  the amount of intellectual dishonesty is over the roof here . 
   neither does bitcoin , you are under the false assumption that mining is for creating bitcoins , it is not . 
  they 're awarde bitcoins . 
  again pow is stupid , incredibly stupid . 
  they consume as much energy as friggin denmark . 
  that 's dumb . 
  but hey , as gw gets worse , you can at least say `` at least we have a descentralised currency ... provided no one has 51 % '', 
   again since it consumes less per worth transferred now , what does that even mean ? 
  bitcoin transactions consume less energy because there ** are fewer transactions in bitcoin ** . 
  if you have 1 million dollar transactions or 1 million bitcoin transactions , the energy consumed is the same . 
   and there you consume the profits to buy fuel for private jets . 
  what profits ? 
  what the heck are you talking about dude ? 
  the central banks do not create profits by creating money . 
  the inflation simply means that the new money is worth less . 
  there is no profit from that . 
  money is either fiduciary ( based on trust ) or pow . 
  fiduciary does not consume any energy as a core principle . 
  pow ** does ** consume energy . 
  stop pretending bitcoin mining is n't just throwing good electricity out the window . 
  it simply is that . 
  you make think that 's fine . 
  but for me the cost of exchanging trust with throwing electricity out the window is criminal in today 's gw context . 
  add to that that you actually need to trust nobody has 51 % and it all becomes pointless since you 're back as square one , where you need to trust someone . 
   first is unpredictable , do you have any idea about what the people in charge of banking are thinking ? 
  do you understand the difference between banking and economic policies ? 
   you are acting as if the money you spend on conventional banking somehow goes poof and does n't contribute anything to global warming . 
  again , if tomorrow the new dollar is the bitcoin , it wo n't consume less electricity . 
  the power consumed is just to connect stuff , move a couple of bits here to there . 
  there is basically 0 power consumption to create dollars . 
  here you consume power to create currency which is the most idiotic thing possible . 
   its no worse than conventional banking when you consider the full consequence of both . 
  in terms of gw it is ** far ** ** far ** worse . 
   i personally have 0 loyalty to the euro . 
  i do because my savings and salary are in euro . 
   you have to consider the effect of the 51 % attack though . 
  you ca n't actually steal anything or profit in any way from the network by doing it . 
  the instant that the attack happens , it will be blatantly obvious to the whole network and will cause an immediate crash of the currency . 
  and so we return to any other currency where we just have to trust a higher power . 
  instead of trusting a government , we have to trust someone with a ton of computing power . 
   if you compare the monetary value of the energy used to conventional banking it is still less than conventional banking in relation to the market cap . 
  what do you mean ? 
  banks move vastly more money than bitcoin can even hope to . 
  if tomorrow the next dollar is the bitcoin , bitcoin will use just as much power but you have to add the power to mine . 
  for me that 's just stupid stupid stupid . 
  in the day of global warming , you 're telling us the future is `` let 's use a fuckton of gigawatts electricity just to show that we can '' can we agree how monumentally stupid this is ? 
  sauce ? 
  you 're bitching about irrelevant comments by making irrelevant comments to the thread or to the discussion . 
  nice trolling dude . 
   if some countries currency goes to shit , the locals are just going to start using some other currency , just like so many underdeveloped countries unofficially using the us dollar for example . 
  there is little desire for a citizen of country a to see their currency go to the shitter . 
  having to use another currency also represents a whole new challenge . 
   as time goes on and they become more mainstream , they will become more stable and might even rival the euro or dollar in terms of stability one day . 
  yeah unless there 's a 50 % attack . 
  not to mention that the current standard is wonky . 
  you do n't really know when your transaction will take place , it can not even come close to processing transactions at the speed of visa for example , and the fact of using as much energy as denmark to mine just bothers me . 
  you are like all these vegans who pretend to care about the animals , but they just want you to not eat meat . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  it 's a fact that france struggled during mali and lybia . 
  and they 're next door not half a planet away . 
   to take irrelevant & nbsp ;  - is it because soldiers are voting right and far right ? 
  borders have always been drawn regardless of ethnic characteristics . 
  did ukraine or belorussia get a country after ww1 or did poland , romania and the soviet union get those regions ? 
  how about szekelyland ? 
  why were cities in western romania like oradea given to romania even though they were a majority of hungarians ? 
  so you 'd rather be north korea with a somewhat strong army and shit economy than netherlands a strong economy and shit army ? 
  having a strong army while the economy is in the shitter is pointless . 
  dude do you realise that 's simply isis propaganda ? 
  syria has been free to follow whatever destinity it wished for more than 70 years . 
  it was only a french protectorate for 30 years . 
  heck it even united with egypt . 
   not the ability to have a quick intervention force read the comment chain . 
  mainly this : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6o7295/french_military_head_de_villiers_quits_over_cuts/dkf4na4/  do you known how many country in europe can intervene anywhere in the world in less than 24 hours ? 
   a myth talk numerous time by pierre servant , the presentator of france 2 every year for le d\u00e9fil\u00e9 militaire du 14 juillet . 
  oh right . 
  no one would dare to bs patriotic nonsense on national tv during * he friggin military march on the national day * . 
   as our troop are now begging for fucking yankee 's planes to transport them in africa . 
  so you agree we can not deploy soldier in africa , but you also think if needed , we can totally deplay soldiers in 24 hours in chile or something . 
   talk about picking bad example . 
  mali is the exact proof of the opposite mali is the perfect example . 
  it 's in our backdoor and we still needed essential help from us and uk . 
  http://breakingdefense.com/2013/06/french-lessons-from-mali-fight-alone-supply-together/  very few nato countries have the capabilities to carry out an operation like serval , but france could not have done it without allied contribution . 
  three allied capabilities were crucial to france : airlift , airborne tankers and isr . 
  we were so deprived we needed to buy in emergency 4 c-130 . 
  imagine france that supports so heavily the a400m having to bite the bullet because the needs were simply too great . 
   i speak about upcoming events that can lead to the deployment of french soldiers whatever in our eez or in a time of a major crisis again , we can not deploy soldiers as is ... see mali where the us contribution in supply planes was very important . 
   the army is the hard power of a country ( next to its other component , soft power ) - by cutting each time in the army , macron is just giving up the residual of french sovereignty we are going under the 3 % that the eu demands . 
  we are a limping military power and an even more limping economic power . 
  it 's time to tell to reel in . 
  * lybia [ cost 300 million euros ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2011/10/21/01003-20111021artfig00508-la-guerre-en-libye-a-coute-300-millions-d-euros-a-la-france.php ) * syria + irak [ 360 millions ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2016/11/17/01003-20161117artfig00340-en-2016-les-operations-en-syrie-et-en-irak-couteront-360-millions-d-euros-a-la-france.php ) . 
  that 660 million right off the bat that were spent stupidly because `` muh frnch sovereiinty '', 
   lol what ? 
  last time i checked all the refugees want to go to germany not france . 
   do you known how many country in europe can intervene anywhere in the world in less than 24 hours ? 
    two , uk and france . 
  that 's a myth . 
  no we can not intervene anywhere in the globe in 24h alone .
