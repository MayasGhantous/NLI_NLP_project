  mali is sufficient proof of that . 
   i want the soldiers , and the gears well prepared for their missions . 
  and i want the soldiers to not be sent to missions that are not essential for france . 
  syria is not essential for france . 
   to send soldiers die in your interest syria is a french interest ? 
  i believe germany and other countries are far more interested in what happens in syria than france . 
  well fiiiine . 
  we 'll only do statistics on stakhanov . 
  you ca n't eliminate all jobs that are under 40h and then calculate the average and say omg see guys we 're working more than 40h . 
   these worthless politicians scumbags . 
  nope . 
  the only change is that exterior operations missions will have to be paid by the defense budget and not by all the other ministeries . 
  which is kinda good . 
  it 's high time france reduces its footprint abroad and let other powerful european nations do some work . 
   not if you go by fulltime jobs ( germany 41,8 h ; france 40,4 h ) why would you eliminate the other jobs ? 
   right-wing politician . 
  far right politician . 
   that 's the percentage of their total gdp i bet , lel what ? 
  you think the gdp of france is 0.85 * 100/1 .5 = 56 billion euros ? 
   35 hours/week the average frenchman works longer hours than the average german . 
  in fact the average work week is about 40h in france . 
  yup . 
  you can use ms paint as you cad tool . 
   but for the average jew in france . 
  do you have statistics that the average jew is less safe in france compared to israel ? 
   cop out attempt . 
  the statistics that show that france is much safer than israel are also cop outs , 
   the woman was killed and the government wont even admit that its a terror attack . 
  n if you have any info that it was a terrorist attack , call the french police . 
  because ... well ... 
  the dude was actually crazy . 
  was rambling incoherent shit when arrested and wasput in a psychiatric hospital http://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75011/sexagenaire-defenestree-le-meurtrier-presume-interne-en-psychiatrie-05-04-2017-6828552.php, 
  did you normalise by the size of the population ? 
  or heck look at this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index but nice circle jerk . 
  please continue , do n't let me stop you , 
   erm , that is still way lower than paris alone . 
  the population of the parisian region is about 50 % larger than that of israel . 
   you completely miss the point , the jew in france before being jew , are french - so are the muslims . 
  those that do not feel french are free to leave . 
  be it to other muslim countries or to israel . 
   like the french muslim are doing on french soil some muslims are doing bad things but the ** vast ** majority are peaceful chaps . 
   michelangelo . 
  you mean the guy that got censored by the pope ? 
  religion did n't create michelangelo , it just so happened that the richest people happened to be religious folk . 
   in fact california has relied on labor from mexico for its agri sector for almost its entire history . 
  and now cali is on the verge of destruction , right ? 
  wtf is happening here ? 
  do they carry flags with them all the time to give as gifts ? 
  did each of the parties prepare their gift in private and by magic discovered they got the same gift ? 
  did one read the amazon emails of the other ? 
  it may be false but i 'm not putin all my chips on it . 
  they can not shitpost on reddit . 
  oh the tragedy . 
  i do n't think one can trump that . 
   it 's not like there 's `` racism '' against japanese or chinese as there is against islamic immigration for example . 
  yes , yes there is racism against asian . 
  chinese are considered hacks that only copy western stuff , have never had an original idea since 1500s , they just stick amongst themselves , etc. 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came_ ... 
   but the problem is that the profits are not here , so they pay no profit tax here . 
  and how much do you think giants pay in taxes in the west ? 
   answer is a huge dependency on foreign investments , build your own companies , factories and businesses owned by an ee nationalities and then maybe you will get the same salaries as germans in german companies . 
  how would that happen ? 
  during communism , the vast majority of companies were state owned . 
  did they offer western salaries ? 
  after communism fell , many companies were owned by either the state or private nationals . 
  salaries still were not exactly massive . 
  if you think a private owner of a company will want to raise your salary because he shares the same passport as you do , i have a huge surprise for you . 
   we do n't have a lot of native industry left after everything 's been sold out to the western companies . 
  in western europe we complain that people who own the companies just move them around the world in order to pay less taxes and cheaper worker force so that the society they came from does n't really benefit . 
  while in ee they complain that ees do n't own the company . 
  interesting shift of perspective . 
  do n't think that 'll stop migrants . 
   i suppose it 's a person whose ancestry is linked to that of france 's , and not a person whose ancestry comes from another place other than france you refuse to understand / u/captainlargo 's point . 
  i live in a region where about 40 % of french people have italian names . 
  then you have alsace lorraine with their german ancestry , basques , bretons . 
  and let 's not speak about guyane , guadaloupe , tahiti . 
  talking about french ethnicity is like talking about united kingdom ethnicity . 
  luckly your brother and sisters have a redditor sibling . 
  that will help keep in check the population, 
   , restore the core european values . 
  myes . 
   we should aim for freedom and responsibility , considering that for basically the majority of recorded history , europe was feudal , i doubt freedom or responsibility were core values . 
   i 'm not to keen on the economist 's title , but the numbers are pretty striking . 
  it 's pretty crazy to think that only four countries on this list ( ireland , the uk , norway , and ireland ) have a positive rate of natural increas also france . 
  however relying on immigration to save europe from demographic collapse is simply an awful idea and what 's the case for the us for example ? 
  so he ** is ** doing his part in the destruction of amsterdam . 
   going around 40km/h 40 km/h with children seats ? 
  somehow i kinda doubt that unless it 's a steep descent . 
  that 's the average speed of the peloton in the tdf on flats http://www.bicycling.com/racing/tour-de-france/you-versus-a-tour-de-france-pro-cyclist/slide/8, 
   plenty of countries in europe select their high court judges through ... goverment . 
  sources for that . 
  in france at least people in the conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la magistrature are named by other juges and not the govt or parlament . 
   i was n't ready for that horse shlong . 
  who is ? 
  you took it like a champ tho . 
   google , facebook and amazon yeah . 
  it 's impossible to find ai labs in europe . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32977242  facebook is to expand its artificial intelligence research , opening its first lab outside the us , in paris . 
   hire new people only through subcontracting/outsourcing you can not seriously believe that only europe does subcontracting and outsourcing . 
   the stream of new migrants having arrived in the last two years are not exactly specialists or even talent .
