  how 's that relevant ? 
  has a a tech talent ever said darn i wan na go to europe but the refugee thing ... meh , guess i 'll skip . 
   so inequality is very high in the us , but so are the incomes of all groups . 
  us productivity ( salary divided by number of hours worked ) is about at the same level as germany or france . 
  one should take that into account . 
  americans simply work more . 
  france offers very generous offset deals http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-france-ink-\u20ac7.87-billion-agreement-for-36-rafales/article14995775.ece  there is a 50 percent offset clause under which french industry will invest half the contract value back in the country which is expected to develop some expertise domestically in the aerospace sector . 
   want to take guesses ? 
    typhoon fms : $ 320m usd - source   rafale fms : $ 245m usd - source   f-35 fms : 186m usd - source did you just look at sale prices , divided by the number of aircrafts sold and call it a day ? 
  wtf dude . 
  that 's not how it 's done . 
  http://www.defensenews.com/articles/india-inks-deal-with-france-for-36-rafale-fighter-jets  of the total reported amount , $ 3.42 billion is for the cost of the platform ; another $ 1.8 billion is for support and infrastructure supplies ; ** $ 1.7 billion will be spent to meet india-specific changes on the aircraft ; ** $ 710 million is the additional weapons package ; and $ 353 million is the cost of performance-based logistics support , the mod official said . 
  also france is very well known for offering very good offset deals with local productions as well meaning the partners have access to the tech . 
  while the us shuts everything down . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-35_lightning_ii_procurement#turkey  defense minister vecdi g\u00f6n\u00fcl said that the negotiations for access to the f-35 source codes , including codes that can be used to control the aircraft remotely , had not yielded `` satisfactory results '' and that under these conditions turkey could not accept the aircraft . 
  that shit has a cost . 
   according to a source in the indian ministry of defence ( mod ) , the order is worth about $ 7.89 billion ( us $ 8.85 billion ) . 
  france is expected to invest 30 percent of the total order cost in india 's military aeronautics-related research programs and 20 percent into local production of rafale components to fulfill the mandatory offsets under the deal . 
  hyperbole involves exaggeration where you take something that is kinda true and blow it up . 
  telling a beautiful woman that she 's the most beautiful woman in the world . 
   americans will have 6th gen fighters already and they will be cheaper than eurofighter 5th gen , i am sure . 
  yup . 
  `` f35 is cheaper than the rafale '' said nobody . 
   with lower taxes on corporations the hope is that they will spend more on r&d corporations do r & d that they do n't share or they patent to the teeth . 
  okay buddy . 
  how is the & d inefficient, 
   they have a bloated an inefficient public sector , yes army and universities are very inefficient . 
   who are often high achievers let 's not forget let 's see them achieve stuff without r&d . 
   hardened criminals is somehow more humane and commendable than giving someone a painless death , a luxury that a lot of upstanding citizens do n't get . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm sure all those condemned to the death penalty are super happy about it . 
   do n't pretend throwing someone into a cell to spend the rest of their life with very few countries actually have an actual ** life ** in prison . 
  in the majority of countries there 's a maximum penalty . 
   it 's the size of a manhole cover well you have a fat ass . 
  so how is trump special compared to any other president you 've elected so far ? 
  do you expect to obtain profits from government services ? 
   time to take some cheap ryanair flight you want to fully experience the raw emotion ? 
  we already have that . 
  we do n't get to decide who represents the american people . 
  they decided and that 's it . 
  plus no matter how it goes during trump , i reheheally doubt he can do worse than people like andrew jackson . 
  donald jr will also show up ? 
  i love your work gauss . 
   the argument however was that the burka should be banned because you are forcing women to dress in a certain way . 
  did you actually bother to read the law ? 
   if someone argued the burka should be banned as it allows us to identify people , then that 's reasonable . 
  hint : that 's how the law is phrased . 
  this is the law . 
  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=jorftext000022911670 no one can hide their face in public . 
  i do n't understand why people do n't bother reading the law then commenting . 
  you wo n't even find the word burqa . 
   10:25 am bst 18 may 2010 do you have more recent shit ? 
  you know like stuff ** after ** the law was signed ? 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/loi_interdisant_la_dissimulation_du_visage_dans_l'espace_public meanwhile 1536 fines were given by the police in 5 years . 
  edit : just because something is illegal , does n't mean you can apply the law by yourself . 
  i wan na see you handing out fines for illegal parking or whatever . 
   the police asking me to show my id is n't the same as being forced not to wear a piece of clothing . 
  the police force you to show your id . 
  in the same vein , the police will force you to show your face . 
  if you refuse you get fined . 
  wait , you think random people run around in france ripping off burqas off of women ? 
   the problem is that if you ban it outright , then you 're replacing one form of oppression with another . 
  is it an oppression when the police asks you to show them your id ? 
  exactly . 
  i fully agree with your comment . 
  i do n't know why it 's such a controversial opinion though . 
  this comment has nothing to do with the thread but since i am asked i shall reply ** but ** one should avoid it . 
   against the retribuntional ( and unlawfull ) killings of french ( alleged ) collaborators ? 
  i believe that a lot of the killing of people after ww2 amounted to a large witchhunt that was never really fully understood . 
  i am against the capital punishment , but it was legal in france back then . 
  if a capital punishment is to be applied , it should be applied according to the law ** after a trial ** . 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extrajudicial  not forming a valid part of regular legal proceedings  delivered without legal authority i believe it is a massive crime against humanity what happened that needs to be judged accordingly . 
  https://clio.revues.org/519#tocto1n1 in morbihan alone , 21 women were executed for having intimate relations with germans . 
  is that what you 'd call a collaboration ? 
  only in 2150 cases , is the gender of the person known ( to show how ridiculous the whole process was ) . 
  and 21 % of these people were women . 
  people were executed in the street . 
  a woman that was a cook for gestapo was executed with 4 bullets in the head . 
  in cor\u00e8ze a woman just eliberated from interment camps was executed . 
  i take accusations of trying to diminish the importance of genocides very seriously . 
   because that is exactly what you are trying to do . 
  so saying it is unhistoric to rank these genocides is `` diminishing the srebenican genocide '' ? 
  okay . 
  we 'll agree to disagree . 
  exactly . 
  / u/buttmaybee [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mklyp/today_marks_22_years_since_the_srebrenica/dk2agph/ ) that replays the experiences of what happened is far more useful to understanding and commemorating than a general comment by the un secgen that does n't really convey any information . 
   seriously , this kind of bashing is totally uncalled for , but this bashing :  it seems to me that you are only trying to downplay the crime using false equivalences . 
  that 's totally called for ? 
  i was being reasonable i did not call out names . 
  it is a very serious crime . 
  it is a genocide . 
  and we should commemorate it for what it was . 
  all crimes should be commemorated as they were and not some kind fucking contest that 's annoying ( and only pushes people into a corner ** as seen in this very thread ** ) . 
  if there a fight to be the worst crime since ww2 ? 
  is there a contest ? 
  and to start accusing others of downplaying simply because you do n't believe that `` ranks of crimes '' is a thing , is not a trollish behaviour ? 
   there were also plenty of acquittals among the accused . 
  do you understand that 8775 people were killed without ** any fucking trial ** . 
  is that such a difficult thing to grasp ? 
   but yes the hanging of poor misunderstood fascist traitors so you know for a fact that everyone of those 8775 killed without any fucking trial were all `` misunderstood fascist traitors '' ?
