   i never claimed to know french history better than anyone seems to me that you are indeed claiming exactly that . 
  you claim you have more knowledge of the 8775 killed than the actual historians . 
  or ... you 're just a troll . 
   but yes the hanging of poor misunderstood fascist traitors post ww2 is as bad as slicing throats of babies and gutting pregnant women in srebenica / yeah you 're just a troll putting words in other people 's mouths . 
  blocked . 
  cheers . 
   it seems to me that you are only trying to downplay the crime using false equivalences . 
  fuck you sound as petty as the serbians that claim it is n't an actual genocide because they just killed men or some other bs . 
  you are just being petty ** absolutely wanting that nice badge ** of the worst single crime since ww2 even though it is just a pointless badge . 
  it has no historic value , it has no meaning either since it 's impossible to rank crimes . 
  it also has no commemorative value . 
  it sounds trivial as fuck compared to the actual crime that happened and you 're just doing unhistoric virtue signaling . 
  i 'll leave you to it since i 'd rather discuss history or sincere commemorations . 
  not white knights . 
   of these 2,853 , 73 percent were commuted by de gaulle , and 767 carried out . 
  in addition , about 770 executions were ordered by the military tribunals . 
  only 770 executions were legal . 
   but idk , maybe you also think n\u00fcrenberg was unlawful . 
  neah i just know that 770 < 10500 . 
  you know french history better than french historians ? 
  they 'll sent casgiu merzu to your family . 
   how can you even compare the trials do you know the definition of extrajudicial killing ? 
   of course , this thread is meant for commemoration well then have a commemoration not some kind of ridiculous unhistoric game of ranking crimes that have no business being ranked . 
  heck go to / r/askhistorians and ask the question of what it the worst crime . 
   srebrenica is the single worst crime on european soil since ww2 the rape of a berlin is a single crime . 
  the french epuration is a single crime . 
   i can agree with 300-500k what 's your methodology ? 
   the methodology that was used to count the victims of this rape was awful russia has experts in rape counting ? 
  why not give them a flair because they have observer status at the un . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_observers and the vast number of european countries voted for or abstained . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_the_state_of_palestine#/media/file:un_resolution_of_palestine_as_observer_state.svg they have more recognition from the un than any regional flag . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/pays_basque_ ( am % c3 % a9nagement_du_territoire ) pays basque does indeed exist according to the pasqua law . 
   corsica will be replaced with corsica ( france ) i think the mods should start paying more attention if they receive a package from corsica now . 
  the un secgen is n't exactly a historian . 
  i would n't call srebenica the worst crime since ww2 , mainly because it 's unhistorical to do ranks but also because a shit ton of crimes have been done since ww2 . 
  the soviet gulags . 
  several tens of thousands died in there . 
  romanian communist crimes that are at least in the high tens of thousands . 
  with labour camps at the danube black sea canal and torture prisons around the country . 
  the rape of berlin also can deffo be included since ww2 un europe practically ended by then . 
  some numbers give 10k deaths . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany edit : and we can also include l'\u00e9puration after ww2 in france where some 10k people were killed in extrajudicial executions . 
   and it was really nice cause of the sand once you get past the rocks . 
  oh man , that 's the main thing i hate . 
  the fact that it 's soil or silt or some other slimey thing . 
   im talking about the actual army , in 1939 sept germany was utter shit but in may 1940 a mere 9 months later it was exceptional ? 
  of course not . 
  you 're just comparing numbers without actually understading the big issue . 
  the french army was not trained as well as the german army . 
  if on a defensive we lost , we would have lost on foreign ground . 
  they had superior tactics and far better resources . 
   france committed to conflict . 
  she declared war on germany . 
  she expected to be in for another long , bloody conflict that ground up much of her manpower . 
  it 's also good to explain why what happened , happened . 
  i mean look at the front in 1918 . http://courses.missouristate.edu/bobmiller/hst/hst122/w_front,%201918.jpg ww1 was never carried in germany . 
  there was no massive defeat of germany . 
  france also has a more casualties as a percentage of the population than germany . 
  now come 1939 , germany had ** twice ** the gdp per capita of france . 
  there were in a much more militarist mindset than germany that had the desire to prove itself . 
  and germany 70 million people while france had 42 . 
   france had the stronger army of europe at the time france had a population of 42 million . 
  germany a population of 69 million . 
  germany had also far better resources at the rhine . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_%28ppp%29 germany also had ** twice ** the gdp per capita compared to france . 
  you ca n't just look at the number of tanks and say oh yeah france would have won . 
   what you argue is understandable from your point of view but you have to understand the polish perspective as well . 
  i understand the polish perspective in 1939 when they demanded that uk+f rance commit to a direct war on germany . 
  it was the only means of survival . 
  i understand the uk+f rench position when they did n't want to fully invade germany as well . 
  you just come out of a devastating war , your strategy is to wait for them to come to you . 
   you ca n't fauilt polish disappointment over this . 
  i do n't fault polish disappointment of the results of ww2 . 
  poland fought against the nazis and got no better treatment than romania or hungary . 
  but for 1939 , i mean what can you expect man ? 
  also weird how no polish is criticizing the winners of ww2 but france gets shit on ... 
  it 's almost like ... almost like people are using current day perceptions on events that happened 75 years ago . 
  this i kinda agree on versailles . 
   one must finish the enemy , france did n't in 1918 and payed the price in 1940-45 . 
  1918 was n't a total victory by any stretch of the word . 
  you can not finish an enemy you did not conquer . 
  so 200k is your goal ? 
  i thought it was how evil the british and their parade are . 
   but now you contradict your other arguments in that thread with the guy . 
  what arguments ? 
  the only argument here is : * did france and uk declare war on germany ? 
  ** yes ** . 
  * did the french and the british ** at the time ** think the only way to win a war with germany is by having a defensive war ? 
  ** yes ** . 
  * if france and uk had won the war with germany , would they have granted freedom to poland ? 
  ** yes ** . 
  omg yes . 
  only 160k polish people . 
  that 's so evil of them . 
   most notably not allying with countries like france and the uk . 
  and that 's not trolling ? 
  how would poland have survived without any alliance from the west ? 
   france never actually planned to go beyond the maginot line . 
  if we 're playing the dishonesty game : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saar_offensive, 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28979789  by 1951 the uk census showed the number of polish-born immigrants had quadrupled since before the war , to more than 160,000 .
