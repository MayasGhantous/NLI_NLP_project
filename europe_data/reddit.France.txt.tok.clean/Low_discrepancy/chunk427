  evil brits . 
   during the war , more than 200,000 members of the polish armed forces in the west had fought under british high command . 
  and those 200k polish were allowed to remain in uk and not be sent back to their homeland . 
  if uk was so evil , why did they remain ? 
  would n't it be nice to thank the uk government and its people for having the kindness to accept them . 
  it 's better to shit on uk because a fucking parade . 
   with that defence you should n't try to silence / u/santo-subito then . 
  i silenced him because of trollish comments \u00e0 la `` cowards ''   the plan is to hide out in a bunker if your ally is attacked  i 'm really starting to understand the defeatist memes about france . 
   did france and uk declare war on germany ? 
   sending a telegram to berlin really deterred their attack in poland . 
  the french are the true heroes of wwii . 
  it is a trollish behaviour since he attempts to raise the tone of conversation with cheap shots . 
  hey i 'm not perfect , but if a comment offers arguments , they should be replied with arguments and not claiming people made statements they never made . 
   i mean apart from this entire apologetic narrative apologetic ? 
  for not wanting a full frontal attack 20 years after 5 % of your population was killed ? 
  yeah i 'm super apologetic about that . 
  they had plans to stick to the maginot line and that 's it . 
  they did their best with the information they had . 
   but once again they got shafted , in the military parade in the uk they were n't even there to be celebrated for their contribution . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_resettlement_act_1947 yeah fucking uk allowing 200k people the right to remain in uk . 
  they 're disgusting . 
   nope , france did n't lost to spite poland , france lost because their command was incompetent . 
  so be it . 
  no one claims competency when they lose a war , do they ? 
  i do not have any doubt that they did the best with the information and the history they had . 
   now stfu stfu because in france and uk polish troops trained . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_air_forces_in_france_and_great_britain i respect the effort provided by all nations that helped fight whatever enemies we faced because some keyboard warrior 's opinion does n't mean shit compared to the men and women that died for france or our allies . 
   what 's your point ? 
  that france and uk were underprepared to wage war with germany and that the type of war that was considered was not an offensive war . 
  that 's a fact . 
   o paint yourselves as innocents . 
  what is this ? 
  a trial ? 
  does the french govt have to plead guilty or innocent ? 
  let 's stay historic here . 
   it was you lot who wanted a tough treaty . 
  again stop using `` you '' it 's beyond stupid . 
  it was n't / u/low _ discrepancy doing shit there . 
   not an argument . 
  saying `` i have history on my side '' is an argument ? 
  really ? 
  what book should i crack open to read it ? 
  what sources ? 
  people lose wars . 
  it happens . 
  but do n't you think it 's kinda stupid to blame your allies for losing a war ? 
  you think france or uk were thrilled to lose the war ? 
  do you think france or uk lost in order to spite poland or something ? 
   yes or no , did you lot let hitler get away with retaking the rhineland ? 
  then you 'll complain how the versailles was too rough on the germans ? 
  rhineland was german territory , was it not ? 
   yes or no , did you lot let hitler take czechoslovakia ? 
  i fail to see how that is relevant . 
  did germany beat france and uk because of the sudeten ? 
   i literally have history on my side here , you have snarky quips . 
  if history is bunch of ridiculous rants with no connection between each other , the yeah , you have history on your side . 
  here 's a fun game : post your comment on / r/askhistorians . 
  let 's see it shot down . 
   heck yeah but they did for several months what i do honoring ai dow requests in games : accept and contribute nothing . 
  russia burnt down moscow so they could defeat napoleon . 
  war is n't just attack attack attack . 
  war can also be this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fabian_strategy the maginot line was based on the idea that the allies had better resources then germany so we 'd just have to wait it out . 
  again https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maginot_line  french planning for war with germany was always based on the assumption that the war would be la guerre de longue dur\u00e9e ( the war of the long duration ) , in which the superior economic resources of the allies would gradually grind the germans down . 
  you declare a war to win it through whatever means you have at your disposition . 
  if your strategy is a defensive one , then that is your strategy and you hope you worked out sufficient kinks for it to be successful . 
  it was n't . 
  on the eastern front it was . 
  are the russians pissed they won it or pissed they beat napoleon with defensive strategies ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  ok , i 'll stop feeding the troll . 
  you can not talk without insulting people left and right . 
  blocked . 
  gday . 
  indeed . 
  but the strategy of the allies was to have a long war with germany where the country with the most ressources would win . 
  invading germany in sept 39 would have rendered all those plans useless . 
  shit happened and that 's it . 
   you lot and the brits let hitler get away with everything , you let the rhineland be retaken , you let all of czechoslovakia be taken and sat there and did fuck all , then you both guaranteed poland and did fuck all . 
  ah the historian of reddit . 
  wonderful job buddy . 
  wonderful . 
  you sound so level headed too . 
   that 's why he attacked us first , but there was no help for us from france and uk . 
  the major strategy of france was a defensive one . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maginot_line  french planning for war with germany was always based on the assumption that the war would be la guerre de longue dur\u00e9e ( the war of the long duration ) , in which the superior economic resources of the allies would gradually grind the germans down . 
  did france and uk declare war on germany ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declarations_of_war_during_world_war_ii yes , yes they fucking did . 
  now stfu and have an ounce of respect for people who died for your country . 
  yeah i wonder why a country devastated by a war just 20 years prior was reluctant to start invading left and right . 
  ya know , a country that put basically all its chips on a defensive strategy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maginot_line but hey , this is / r/europe and everyone 's an expert here . 
   most notably not allying with countries like france and the uk . 
  true . 
  poland is a great team player . 
  they went into iraq and that was a great success . 
  that still beats the russian hipster . 
  penis leg ? 
   `` aquarium la rochelle '' nice touch . 
  aquariums across france have that .
