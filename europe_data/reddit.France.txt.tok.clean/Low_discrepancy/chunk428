  same in monaco . 
  dunno why . 
  shit costs 2 euros, 
     but '' ha !, 
  you 're actually still using cnn as a source '' will definitely get you a ban . 
  yeah . 
  i have no problem with that . 
  they dislike trump and are sometimes very biased . 
  but i do n't think they 'll ban you . 
   you get banned from politics and news if you disagree with the narrative . 
  do you get banned from / r/politics for saying something pro trump ? 
  lakes freak me out which is kinda weird because i love the sea . 
   btw , what is airbnb ? 
  it 's a service used to price out people who actually need to live in cities that have tourists . 
  oh wow 120k likes on fb . 
  my bad . 
  i 'm mistaken it 's a regular army . 
  so 20 idiots = french people ? 
  you should learn how to count . 
  ths very sensual moment in the vid . 
  https://youtu.be/mflagxs0mgm?t=3m17s nsfw, 
  we produce far less co2 per capita than other large countries . 
  and we 're talking about climate here , so that 's what counts . 
  also because something was n't done in the past , does n't mean it can not be done in the future . 
  to think it was just 2 months ago that france was drinking extreme right tears :'), 
   when governments refuse to act people will . 
  what people ? 
  the french and italian people are n't these idiots . 
  much easier to search for mates this way, 
   a medievel french warrior that defended his homelands . 
  you should not impose your 21st century thinking of homeland nation people to 7-8th century . 
  there was no homeland , there was no people . 
  there was a royal family with with complete ** divine ** rights over the lands and those inhabiting it , there was a clergy that was dispensing those divine rights , and there was the nobility with rights to administer in the name of the royal family but with the obligation to defend . 
  the lands owned by a king would be result of divine intervention . 
  either through inheritance , from marriage or from war . 
  that 's why it was legitimate for normand kings to rule england or for aquitaine to change hands according to whom married whom . 
  that 's why it was legitimate for martel to burn down christian cities like niles , b\u00e9ziers , agde . 
  you do n't burn down your homeland do you ? 
   truly one of the greatest belgians in history . 
  you can have him . 
   this seems to imply that if op were french , he would be seen as an alt-right supporter for admiring martel , whilst this does n't have to be the case . 
  what 's so hard to understand . 
  hitler has a weird following in indonesia and south east asia . 
  does that mean that they wan na kill jews ? 
  i do n't know . 
  but if a german loves hitler , i 'll have extreme doubts . 
   admiring the resisting of muslim invasions is indeed extremely islamophobic . 
  they also tend to conveniently forget how he attacked the christian cities of agde , beziers and burnt arenes de nimes . 
   it 's just that admiring charles martel does n't automatically make one islamophobic . 
  what ? 
   in france , he 's mostly admired by the racist and islamophobic far right he 's saying that racists admire him , not that people who admire him are racist . 
   it 's almost like we 're on another continent . 
  guiana ( in france ) and st. pierre and miquelon ( also in france ) have homicide rates 4-5x ours . 
  holy / r/badstatistics batman . 
   can we say his speech was great without being called alt-right ? 
  great speeches that result in shitty policies means shit . 
   in poland he is considered a scientist of jewish origin . 
  in science what * might * matter is school you 're part of . 
  he was part of the german school of physics . 
  there was no jewish school of science at that time . 
  that would be the `` identity '' of his scientific output . 
  it would carry german characteristics . 
  concerning his personal identity , that 's up to him to define himself however he wishes . 
   actually you shame her holy shitsnacks dude . 
  calm the fuck down . 
  nationalism has no business in science . 
  she did have a thing for miniscule stuff . 
  `` i 'm sorry sir , this conference is for people that have made significant scientific advancements '', 
  it 's ironic because induced radioactivity was discovered by irene curie and joliot . 
   just like french flag sometimes i feel like i should pay to be on / r/europe . 
  so many high quality , new jokes , you 'd think they 're made by professionals . 
   nuclear race , space race , you name it . 
  are you confusing science with engineering ? 
  how many nobel prizes were awarded for the space race ? 
  no scientific breakthroughs were made during the space race . 
  the manhattan project . 
  https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/2789/nobel-prize-work-derived-from-manhattan-project-research well yeah some nobel prize worth stuff can arguably be said to originate from that . 
  but even then , the massive massive scientific advancement came from lise meitner ... in nazi germany . 
  but without a trace of a doubt ; the scientific work produced ** after ** the war by the scientific staff , far outweigh in quality and quantity whatever was produced at los alamos . 
  science thrives in open environments where we do n't look at nationality , race etc. 
  proof in point : germany that seppukued its scientifc program by chasing out the jews . 
  her head bobbing up and down can seem like she 's going yeah . 
  they could be talking about a 3rd person that 's unpleasant to both of them . 
  his open hand can seem like he 's saying i had enough , a blocking gesture . 
  and she 's like oh yeah tell me about it , he 's a dick . 
  i 'm making all this up , it 's really impossible to tell from this sequence what 's happening, 
  i also find it weird when people bring in nationality in topics regarding science . 
  everyone benefits from knowledge , not just one nation . 
  it is not a competition . 
  maybe you 're reading too much into this ? 
   talked about more often than the second one . 
  shame the holocaust is not talked more in the media . 
  that makes no sense whatsoever . 
  so antonescu the guy that organised the romanian holocaust is better than illiescu cuz one got his punishment ? 
  and even by your logic , horia sima the ruler of the fascist iron guard , that died peacefully in 93 in madrid , is far more deserving here because he was a main implementor of the romanian holocaust . 
  guess his conscience is still in that jail cell, 
  what i want to know is the quantity of red meat vs white meat , because it 's not the same thing . 
  i thought venice was older . 
  holy crap , i admire your resilience . 
   what can i say that western culture is at stake !!! ...
