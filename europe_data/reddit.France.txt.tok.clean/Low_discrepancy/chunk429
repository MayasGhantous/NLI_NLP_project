  according to the ruler of the free world . 
  i think liking trump so much that you 'd draw him is a far more scandalous thing than doing it because you were paid . 
  i like how she spruced up his [ chin ] ( http://crazyvibezradio.com/images/articles/2016/05/trump3.jpg ) . 
  that 's nice of her . 
  ok that 's good to know . 
  thanks . 
  so many good arguments right here that you 're making . 
  we 're so high because everybody that feared walking home ... ** is deaaaad ** . 
  from ** terrorism ** . 
  also no-go zones . 
   we are preparing for both what massive investments has estonia performed in cybertech ? 
   but one is very much unlike the other . 
  yes , one happened , it caused significant damage , can cause again significant damage and russia simply says : hey it was n't us !, 
   and apparently it 's not seen in the best of light by some in brussels . 
  shame . 
  it would be a wonderful application of a multispeed eu . 
  i wish he would n't write his own tweets too . 
  so you 'd rather prepare for an attack that will not happen vs attacks that are extremelly likely and have happened already in the last decade several times ? 
  okay ... 
  i guess this also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aster_ ( missile_family ), 
  doubt small arms can protect the baltics from the actual largest threat it faces . 
  am too busy spreading islamism . 
   i did n't even implied that you were muslim :  oh wow , you 're so openminded : , 
   it does n't make any less true what i said in your mind , everything you said is true , i wo n't doubt that . 
  it 's just pointless to argue with someone that views french problems only through a specific hurr durr terrorism prism . 
  so i 'll just sit here and enjoy seeing catholics take political blows one after another . 
  hey in vitro will be made legal for gay couples soon enough . 
  i wan na see them rage , it 's fun . 
   mocking anything related to islam ( prophet included ) will face severe and heavy pressure http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-30838667/pope-francis-curse-my-mother-expect-a-punch like pope francis that said ** after the friggin ch terrorist attack ** that if you insult his mother , you can expect a punch ? 
  that kind of heavy pressure ? 
   i was too naive about the entrepreneurs ' pride . 
  well maybe we 'll learn from ukrainian entrepreneurs . 
  i am sure they 're much more moral than any others . 
   i thought european entrepreneurs would show some pride when dealing with russians after the mh17 accident . 
  nice soapbox . 
  where did you get it from ? 
   yeah the great threat of the catholics in france , really they are on the verge of breaking out the power in place like during the ancien r\u00e9gime - the same that have been tamed by the third republic with the army being send to comply / s do we have an islamic party in france ? 
  we do have a catholic party sens commun that almost got into the government if it were not for fillon being a corrupt sack of shit . 
  want to recall the gay marriage protests ? 
  it was absolutely disgusting . 
  do we see such things in germany or uk when those laws passed ? 
  in france ... hell ya . 
   a living proof france ca n't have a proper debate about anything before being called up by silly names https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbrk-fqcntw yeah shouting to a black woman : `` monkey eat your banana '' , that sets a certain bar . 
   dunno about good , but in terms of not being destroyed completely , maybe saudi arabia yeah going full on ksa and constantly shitting on iran is definitely a good strategy and nothing bad can ever come from it . 
   but for pc reasons they chose eastern europeans ( hence eu ) as a scapegoat to vent - and i do n't mean that literally , but it came from kind of social subconsciousness or a zeitgeist . 
  so you majored in psychology or something ? 
   - a matter of years until blasphemy is back in france yeah fucking catholics . 
  we saw their hide appear in comments when simone veil just died . 
  mama merkel bad . 
  get in line with the circlejerk on / r/europe man . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/merkel-backs-idea-of-multispeed-europe-at-versailles-meet/a-37833273 https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/macron-outlines-plans-for-multi-speed-europe/, 
   decades france especially has being picking and choosing what rules to follow the french get all high and mighty again . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  i presented you with the fact that all the major countries did n't respect the 3 % rule ... because turns out when there 's a crisis it 's very hard to do . 
  in your pathetic french circlejerk , you refuse to understand that it 's not by desire that france does not respect the 3 % rule , but by constraint . 
  respecting it would do worse for everybody . 
  but poland , it chooses to not accept migrants , it chooses to not join the eurozone . 
  again it 's all a moot point . 
  we 'll have a multi-speed eu soon enough . 
  it 's not an ocelot but it 'll do . 
   finland did . 
  estonia did ah yes true powerhorses of the eu project that contribute vast amounts of money to the common budget . 
  ya know , if we stop giving to the eu budget , we 'd respect the 3 % clause . 
   when they did join france refused to allow free movement of polish people . 
  the hypocrisy of france is just legendary . 
  how is that relevant to the current discussion of deficit talks ? 
  continue the circlejerk , salty poles are funny . 
   also poland is not in the eurozone and therefore does not have a 3 % deficit rule never said they had to respect it , just said no one did under 3 % in that period . 
  here 's germany https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/government-budget but do n't let me stop your circle jerk . 
  it 's fun for the whole family . 
   the actual status quo is above 3 % for most of the 2000 's did you bother reading my comment ? 
   except during periods of economic crisis , the 3 % rule was respected there was the 2002 dot-com crisis and the 2007 crash . 
  of fucking course the deficit rule was not respected . 
  no one did the 3 % https://tradingeconomics.com/poland/government-budget here 's poland . 
  but hey continue circlejerking about france i 'm sure it 's useful for some reason or another . 
   but that 's the point , the deficit rulles are not followed for decades . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  3 % rule was put in the 92 maastricht agreement . 
  https://tradingeconomics.com/france/government-budget except during periods of economic crisis , the 3 % rule was respected . 
  ok . go apply for asylum then, 
   in practice they 're not . 
  you have to be hella ignorant to say such a thing . 
  asylum is a strict process goddamit . 
   so in practice the refugee process is just another immigration channel and people see it as such because they 're not idiots . 
  no it is not . 
   i would be willing to bet that the overwhelming majority of people do n't know that the concept of ` ever close union ' event exists , let alone what it means . 
  and not just back than in 2004 . 
  they do n't know about it even today . 
  did n't you know about the euro , about schengen , about uniformization ? 
  really ? 
  though that 's no surprise . 
  look at the turnout for ep elections . 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/fr/turnout.html czech republic is at 18 % , lel . 
  i 'd be super ashamed with such results . 
   right now france has once again failed to produce the budget with annual deficit under 3 % it was 3.4 % from 3.6 % so there is progress . 
  if the growth rate is n't happening as fast as desired ... oh well . 
  and are you saying that the deficit will be larger than 3 % next year ? 
  do you know something we do n't ? 
   i wrote that if the eu wishes to succeed as a whole why not add turkey then ? 
  ca n't add random countries and say oh these are essential to the eu project ( we did that with greece ) .
