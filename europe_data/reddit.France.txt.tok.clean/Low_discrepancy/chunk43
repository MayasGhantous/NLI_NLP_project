  their language is related to ancient greek . 
  many customs etc. 
  it is part of their identity . 
   both come out as seeming as they have little else to be proud of . 
  the french hold dearly to calling only champagne produced in champagne , champagne . 
  if you make your bubbly wine in some other area you call it differently . 
   a little bit like salah abdeslam who walked around in paris for 7 hours after the attacks ? 
  yeah . 
  we did n't arrest the whole of paris . 
  weird is n't it . 
  the guy was unknown to ss because the belgians thought neah we do n't need to tell the french about those guys . 
   or how he was stopped ( together with 2 others ) in cambrai but was allowed to continue yes , there was n't an arrest warrant . 
  are you comparing stopping any movement in a neighborhood vs a whole country ? 
  good job man , 
  normally i 'd agree with you . 
  but they are muslims , it 's not like they have a society or anything . 
  turkey slipped and fell into an invasion ? 
   cyprus and the rivalry with turkey in general are also used like this . 
  did greece or fyrom invade one another ? 
  then neah , it 's not really comparable . 
   cyprus was also used as a distraction ? 
  while i 'm no expert on cyprus , the whole turkey invading cyprus and saying : yeah this whole part is mine , deal with it does n't seem super close to the situation ? 
  and if they are so willingfull to give them money ( which ot bring more to budget then they receive ? ), 
  so wallonia should be kicked outta belgium , ey ? 
  this convo is pointless . 
  cheers . 
  oh do n't you italians start . 
  i was at a restaurant in italy we some friends . 
  we argued quite a bit with the waiters because apparently it 's a sacriledge to not put alcohol in a sorbetto . 
  ( they were not having alcohol for religious reasons ) . 
  oh yeah ... they did put alcohol ... `` beut jeust a litl '' . 
  i had to taste it because my friends did n't realise it had it ( they did n't know the taste of alcohol ) . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33542392 italy 's peppered with stories about this . 
  i thought you italians would understand being butthurt about history and tradition . 
   oversea territories are still former colonies former . 
  you got ta emphase that . 
   ( and some of them are still considered as colonies by un ) do they know what the word colony means ? 
   to give away it 's former empire by giving them fundings and representation instead of their independance . 
  huh ? 
  new caledonia will have a referendum . 
  60 % want to stay in france though . 
  http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/11/17/1992805-hollande-en-nouvelle-caledonie-porteur-d-un-message-d-apaisement.html the comore islands had one in 74 . 
  3 out of 4 wanted independence so they got it . 
  french polynesia is in talks . 
  french guyana and martinique refused more autonomy in referendums http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/01/11/01002-20100111artfig00318-rejet-d-une-autonomie-accrue-en-guyane-et-martinique-.php and reunion is mostly french french . 
  so sorry , but facts do n't back your silly claims . 
  but france does have moral imperative and a high stand ... sorry i ca n't say that with a straight face . 
   father you 're a father if you raise children , not if you kidnap them . 
   army had still support among people . 
  not as much as you think after the whole oas incidents . 
  heck not even the whole army wanted the putsch . 
  it was just a part , that 's why it failed . 
   and you can look at a map and see that france is still one of the most reluctant country to allow self governance or independance to oversea territories . 
  what kind of logic is that ? 
  are we talking about 1960 or 2016 ? 
  the way france is governed has no bearing on colonialism . 
   are you actually arguing `` the majority was belgian so it does n't count '' ? 
  neah man . 
  with two terrorists on the run ** after ** they surrounded the whole area and some wounded cops , the mission was a [ great success . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r13riarkgo0 )  i 'm kinda sure the policemen involved were just following orders you know ... those wounded , i think so too . 
  they were probably sent by their higher ups . 
  but this is outta my league , i do n't know how the whole inquiry went . 
  i measure it by how effective they are surrounding an area occupied by terries . 
   ` to sweep one 's own doorstep first ' between you and me , the french police ** when they surround an area it 's done ** . 
  the kouachi 's did n't escape . 
  merah did n't escape . 
  coulibaly did n't escape , the saint denis terrorists did n't escape . 
  only the yamakazis escape . 
  but that 's a movie . 
   preventing a possible attack . 
  did you get the other two ? 
  how do you know it 's all safe . 
   you 're the one who started the argument by calling them shit , despite the facts not really backing this up . 
  guys there 's an appartment . 
  empty . 
  go check it out . 
  nothing serious , be home by 2 pm or we 'll go to lunch without it . 
  oh shit oh shit it 's housing heavy armed terrorists . 
  guys lets surround the area . 
  there 's a school near by , a factory . 
  no one escapes . 
  they escape on the rooftops . 
  are you friggin kidding me ? 
  how is that not shitty police work ? 
  they had one job : stop the terries . 
  they did n't stop the terries . 
  how 's that not shit ? 
  yes , it 's hard to stop terrorist attacks , you do n't have a magic glass ball . 
  but honestly , when you surround a location , friggin surround it . 
  i 'm amased i 'm more pissed off than you are . 
  and i love the mayor of forest : http://www.lalibre.be/regions/bruxelles/fusillade-a-forest-ecoles-et-creches-rouvrent-peu-apres-les-dernieres-perquisitions-56e8115835708ea2d393b4a4 ` it was just a search warrant that went wrong '' . 
  understatement of the year . 
  yes 4 belgian policemen and 2 french . 
  guuuys do n't worry . 
  it 's empty . 
  chillax , routine operation . 
  when you 'll come back we 'll get some fries at st gilles . 
  the mayor of forest said : `` there were n't any specific threats . 
  it 's just a search warrant that went wrong . '', 
  just a search warrant guys .
