   when called out on `` i visited the ee once , i totally know what i 'm talking about '' all you can do is bleat `` no u '' . 
   oh , wow , you ` be been to ee countries ? 
  makes me just as much of an expert as you and your `` ca n't get good food here cuz evil eu takes it all '' . 
   who did n't negotiate better subsidies for bulgarian farmers during our eu joining talks . 
  that 's utter bullshit . 
  i 've been to eastern european countries even * before * they joined the eu and they had really good fresh produce . 
   the `` free market '' 's because our best and freshest produce is exported to western europe . 
  by the time it gets to we it stops being fresh . 
  and no one is selling in french farmers ' market bulgarian produce . 
   we know enough to justify commencing a vast investigation , not to write it off as eastern european paranoia . 
  i agree . 
  but i have the impression we do n't need to wait some major scientific organisation to start taking notes . 
  it 's as simple as comparing a wide array of products across countries to determine the differences . 
  this work should be done by associations of consumers . 
   `` fresh '' produce at bulgarian markets is in various stages of wilted you either buy wilted produce whose fault is it if farmers ' market is n't good enough ? 
   there is a problem as claimed by ee if and only if you can find a non-negligible number of products , which are better there are probably thousands of products sold across eu borders man . 
  stuff that 's the same here might be different there . 
  that means that statistically some will be better here while others will be better there through whatever definition of better you 'll pick . 
  heck , how difficult is it to take a significant list of products and compare ingredients ? 
  do some statistical work on determining how many of the same brand of sausages have more meat here vs there . 
  correct for the price levels and be done with it . 
  is it systemic , is it a just a company that does it , is it just a few products ? 
  we simply do n't know . 
  he 's quoting swedish democrats . 
  that 's like me quoting fn on immigrants or quoting macron on how amazing the current french govt is . 
  if he 'll quote some serious lawyers in sweden , sure . 
  but he 's not exactly doing that , is he ? 
   so change trademark law ( if that 's even necessary ) ? 
  how ? 
  nutella is different in germany and in france . 
  which one gets called nutella ? 
   sweden and france does n't have the same laws ? 
  i realise that . 
  i simply asked if you actually study law or if you 're just winging it . 
  law is very complicated shit . 
  i am not claiming he 's wrong or not . 
  it 's an actual question . 
  does the person study law or not . 
   the protection of trademark is limited . 
  we 're not talking about shoes here . 
  we 're talking about ferrero having the right to call nutella , nutella with 3 % palm oil or 7 % palm oil . 
  well yes , yes they have that right . 
  you can not ask for nutella with only 3 % palm oil to be called nutella since nutella is n't a term that existed before ferrero invented it and trademarked it . 
  same question still applies . 
  the usual really . 
  fb twitter . 
  no special ones . 
  sadly we french hate learning from americans . 
  i believe in the free market , 
  https://www.just-food.com/news/eu-says-no-evidence-of-brands-double-standards-for-now_id137060.aspx this one shows no evidence . 
  how did they select those 31 products ? 
  surely i can find 31 products where there is no difference between what 's sold the we and ee . 
  that 's because milk is not a trademark term . 
  nutella is trademark . 
  so ferrero can sell you friggin lettuce called nutella because they own that name and they can use it for whatever they like . 
   you are not going to hold accountable companies that engage in unethical business model , thank you for using the correct term ** unethical ** . 
  does ubisoft have an unethical business model by imposing very restrictive drm ? 
  yes sir . 
  should lawmakers make laws so that ubisoft stops it 's idiotic drm . 
  no sir . 
  you vote with your wallet and that 's it . 
   there is no `` think '' . 
  it has been proven to be true by several state agencies in eastern european countries do you have any scientific or exhaustive studies showing this ? 
   basically the right to freedom of assembly makes it impossible to sentence someone for `` simply '' joining a terrorist group , so they need proof of them doing something that 's actually illegal . 
  dude , do you actually study law or are you talking our of your ass ? 
  because in french law , there are laws against conspiracy . 
  and that also applies to terrorism . 
   nothing being innocent in those pictures ( notice the rooster and the clock ) and two iphones . 
  what an idiot . 
   after decades during which catalan support for independence hovered between 15 and 20 per cent , secessionist sentiment started climbing rapidly in 2009 . 
  by 2011 , according to the closely followed survey by the catalan centre for opinion studies ( ceo ) , support for independence was above 30 per cent . 
  two years later , it reached an all-time high of 48.5 per cent .

  explain this then . 
   the denial of the estatut started the butterfly effect . 
   maybe so , but you 're always bringing the euro argument , even if it has nothing to do with it . 
  i only bring it when people complain about multi-speed eu and how bad it would be ... while enjoy the benefits of a multi-speed eu . 
   i can . 
   what . 
  france did n't have french citizens committing terrorist attack recently . 
  who 's the ignorant one ? 
  no obviously you can not since you lack the basic skills on commenting on the topic at hand , which is `` this is the reason i have concerns over ` multi-speed europe ' . '', 
   the real answer is when its economy will be as competitive as most of euromembers . 
  that did n't stop romania from joining the eu even though it had lacked in fighting : * corruption * organised crime romania and bulgaria were monitored . 
  http://www.euronews.com/2017/01/26/eu-to-keep-monitoring-romania-over-corruption it also did n't stop romania from joining the eu even though obviously it did n't meet the standards of living and thus created huge exodus of people . 
  the romanian population increased ** 15 ** times in italy in 15 years . 
  from 2006 to 2007 it ** doubled ** . 
  while i applaud your realisation that romania is n't ready to join the euro , i find it very weird that you refuse to comment on how romania was not ready to join the eu . 
   i hope that it will happen by 2030 . 
  of course . 
  and western eu countries will be doing other things by then . 
  multi speed eu is a good thing for everybody, 
  i do n't think swedish people mind a multi-speed eu . 
  they 're doing their nordic thing either way . 
   we get to know when a french terrorist enters our country . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  fuck me you 're ignorant . 
  can you talk about a topic without resorting to bullshit points trying to piss off the other person ?
