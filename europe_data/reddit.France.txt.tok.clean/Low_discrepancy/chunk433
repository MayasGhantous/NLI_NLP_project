   and is not cherrypicking when we say that we will do it but we are not ready yet . 
  romania is ready ** now ** except the political will is n't there to join erm 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_and_the_euro but hey , let 's say that 's the case . 
  when ** is ** romanian ready to join ? 
  has romania offered any roadmap ? 
  any strong committments other than it 'll happen when it 'll happen ? 
   is due to arrive in a few years and it would be a bad idea to switch to euro right before . 
  indeed , romania is much more stable than the eurozone . 
  how much money did romania borrow from the imf ? 
   after next economic crisis i hope . 
  so romania not in schengen ... bad . 
  romania not in euro ... good ? 
  is it because of euro seems to weak for you people ? 
  and schengen that got suspended by a few countries and the migrant crisis ? 
  that thing does n't worry you then ? 
  seems like countries like to cherry pick here . 
   this is the reason i have concerns over ` multi-speed europe ' . 
  so when will romania join the euro ? 
  why do you czechs get so worked up about guns when you have like half the level we 've got in france . 
  honestly you people love making a mountain out of a molehill . 
  can you read ? 
   keep living in your bubble yeah le pen will win any day now . 
  cuz brexit and trump and polls lie . 
   it does n't matter if the far right lost the election this year , the fact is le pen and her party have gained in popularity . 
  macron is gaining popularity even faster . 
   funny you mention unemployment because lack of employment is an issue for these communities in particular . 
  unemployment happens across france , not just in the cit\u00e9s ( though yes they 're more affected ) . 
   it is , undoubtedly , a large issue it is a large issue but not large enough to sway elections . 
  you know why ? 
  because ** everybody ** says terrorism is bad . 
  just because fn says they wan na ban religious symbols and close borders does n't mean it 'll solve terrorism . 
  and guess what ... people know that . 
   you could admit that you know more about france than french people ? 
  are you for real dude ? 
  i 'm not giving an analysis on why serbia elected the same corrupt dude once again . 
  do n't give me lectures on my country just because you read on / r/europe three threads ... okay ? 
   whatever side of the political divide you 're on , it does n't matter , it is surely pretty obvious the far right is making in roads in europe in response to/as a result of economic migration and a perceived lack of immigration and islamist terror attacks are symptomatic of a failure to successfully integrate migrants from predominantly muslim countries in to european society . 
  dude why are you talking about shit you do n't know ? 
  france has had ** the worst terrorist attacks in 70 years ** and who lost all the elections ? 
  you simply refuse to understand that life is more complicated that hurrr durrr terroriztz . 
  a terrorist attack affects 0.00001 % of the population . 
  unemployment 10 % . 
  you do the maths to see what 's the biggest problem for france . 
   then explain le pen 's performance . 
  you mean the fact that she did n't win after a terrorist attack ? 
   they 're french who hate the innate concepts the republic is founded on and realistically have no connection with any past definition of `` french values '' either . 
  you seem to have a chip on your shoulder . 
  like it or not , this shit does not affect french voters that much . 
  we 're much more worried about unemployment or the state of the economy . 
  but hey , feel free to tell me how things are in my country . 
   third-generation north african immigrants at this point they 're french like it or not . 
   this daycare morality has to be dispensed of , it could only be maintained as long as the west was a self-contained bubble of prosperity and will only get more harmful as time passes . 
  yeah the west is indeed a hellhole . 
  that 's why everyone i talk to wants to go to serbia . 
  wow . 
  you totally convinced me with your arguments . 
   if you introduce uncontrolled economic migrants and do n't have adequate plans to actually integrate them what are you talking about ? 
  in no major eu country is `` economic migrants not integrated '' a big issue . 
  germany will vote again merkel . 
  italy and spain are not troubled . 
  france again was not an issue . 
  unless you mean that economic inner eu issues . 
  some problems with the euro , uk voting brexit because they want to control eu immigration , france with jobs going to ee . 
  it 's like people do n't do words anymore , honestly . 
   so now posters here have changed the definition to make it utterly meaningless . 
  british person thinks single market is meaningless . 
  quelle surprise !, 
  it 's more a courtesy invitation and he 's not expected to show up . 
  i mean it 's in 3 weeks , that 's cutting it really short . 
  i wan na see israel giving up the nuke . 
  huh . 
  til bibi spends time on / r/europe, 
   and you know exactly who the terrorists are in iraq ? 
  it 's illegal for french to go to that warzone . 
  so if they 're there , they should n't be . 
  they should call immediatly the french state to get them out . 
  weird how they 're not and that they 're getting killed by iraqi forces . 
   the sudden impact does . 
  so the electromagnetic force ? 
  preeeeeetty sure spitting on people is against the law . 
  user name checks out !, 
  what 25 and what 35 yo looks like that ? 
  and racism is n't a crime because ? 
  so france and germany were n't destroyed by ww1 and ww2 for example ? 
  and belgium was n't exactly a small country ... with quite a few colonies . 
   without destroying their own country . 
  do n't think you 're talking about europe here . 
   kill , plunder , rape , spread diseases , colonize , exploit yeah we are going back to those traditional values . 
  our young lads that join isis are doing just that !, 
  is n't this local news ? 
  you mean companies likes vw , db , bnp , microsoft getting fined for the bullshit they do ? 
  yeah that would be very regrettable . 
   10 years old karambolage video i bet you 're the type of person that sends an email every week to say whether it 's germany or france . 
   if it is profitable to go to germany , buy those products , drive them to poland , rent a shop , hire people and pay other bills then something is not right , do n't you think ? 
  well there 's a french homeopathic `` pharma '' company that made 80m euros in profits in 2015 . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/boiron does that mean homeopathic works ? 
  more like maybe robespierre or andrew jackson . 
   t 's astounding that i have to explain to you that just giving a link to a source does not actually make an argument . 
  you treat people who are not educated as brain drain . 
  that is absolutely ridiculous . 
  especially since in france , you can not refuse anyone that applies for university . 
  brain drain is ** already educated people ** , because the poor countries already ** spent money and ressources ** trying to educate these people , and now they leave .
