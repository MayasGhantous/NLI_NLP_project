   who do you think has a better chance at finding a job in tallinn : an estonian factory worker with basic education speaking only estonian , or an estonian with university degree speaking several languages does tallinn perform a brain drain ? 
  through some weird logic yes . 
  but that 's not the core concept of brain drain ... unless you stretch it out to the point where it just means `` movement of people '' . 
  which you are basically doing . 
   you gave a great example of a brain drain https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_capital_flight  human capital flight refers to the emigration of highly skilled or well-educated individuals . 
   n estonian factory worker with basic education speaking only estonian , or an estonian with university degree speaking several languages ( 3 is n't uncommon for estonians , afaik ) ? 
  how about an estonian student that can study almost for free in germany or france , even gets needs based scholarships to pay for food and a cheap rent ? 
  compare that again to other countries where it is very difficult to obtain an education . 
   does someone try to swim it though ? 
  and why not ? 
  so you wan na offer easily accessible shuttles between africa and europe then ? 
   the roots of the migration crisis are in economical crisis in africa and beyond . 
  which this ridiculous lawsuit wo n't even come close to solving . 
   poorer ee countries with smaller populations lose out regardless whether its a factory worker or skilled worker that migrates as the wages are higher elsewhere . 
  they see their whole population decline but they should n't see any significant shifts between skilled people and unskilled people . 
  host countries can not say no , while us , canada and in the future uk , can say no thus making it a brain drain . 
   people might recognize that it 's impossible to host everyone at the same time that would like to reduce deaths to zero . 
  well you got ta pick your favourite . 
  there are 0 european deaths when going from europe to the us . 
   brain drain is also a huge issue for ee states as western europe is more attractive and as it 's much easier to migrate because of the single market i 'm sorry but is n't brain drain favoured by countries that impose quota systems and points based immigration ( like the system canada , us have and uk wants to implement ) ? 
  a single market means ** everybody ** can emigrate . 
  a worker can go to a country just as easily as a doctor . 
  in a points based system , doctors can leave much much more easily than workers . 
  you forgot the / s ? 
   it becomes even worse if his presence pushed you to do it , while you might not have done it in these circumstances were it not for his presence . 
  should we sue paramedics that tell people to call them if the od even if they consume illegal substances ? 
   not sure your example is good , as swimming in the first place is not illegal fine . 
  paramedics that help out drunk drivers that have crashed or people that oded . 
   so although it has good humanitarian intentions most likely it has the opposite effect of leading to more deaths than there would be if there was no help in the first place . 
  the deaths happen because two opposite groups of people exist : * one group that wants to reduce the flow of people and the number of deaths is secondary * the other that wants to reduce the number of deaths , while the number of people who do cross the borders is secondary . 
  if what you want to do is reduce the number of deaths as your top priority , just put in a ferry link ... 
   that helping this people is an incentive and facilitation of human trafficking and illegal migration ... how can that make sense from a legal point of view ? 
  if i see a lifeguard on the beach , i know i can swim . 
  so if i die , does that mean that the lifeguard can be sued because they gave me an incentive to swim ? 
   it 's about attacking non-military targets in order to provoke a societal response that would undermine a government you ca n't otherwise defeat . 
  where the heck did you get such a restrictive definition ? 
   and in many places it 's not like you can prop up a ladder and apply a quick fix . 
  put the ladder in the gondola !, 
  duh do we have to think of everything here ? 
  that part of venice was probably one of my favourites . 
  not touristic compared to rialto , st mark square etc. 
  yeah . 
  but it 's an italian military base . 
  i totally did n't go around venice looking at towers and thinking yeah ezio would so easily climb that . 
  here 's a ledge , here 's another one . 
  doubt a chocolatine could negociate better than may, 
  reddit 's using https . 
  how would that entail a retrial ? 
  the issue is the length of the sentence , not if the sentence was legal or not . 
   a new trial in the home country source . 
   germany will never extradite them it is according to the law to serve the sentence in the home country . 
   they at max will serve 5 years instead of the 8 and 9 years they were condamned here that is the maximum sentence in germany . 
  you should push for federalisation if you want a common sentence . 
   germany is trying every trick in the book to not extradite them . 
  is germany refusing to extradite him ? 
  it just takes time . 
  the sentence was final on may 12th ** this year ** . 
   or the german managers convicted in italy for involuntary manslaughter for the the fire at the thyssenkrupp plant in turin which lead to the death of 7 people . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  they ceo of tk in italy [ was sent to jail ] ( http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2016/05/13/cassation-upholds-thyssenkrupp-sentences-2_ae513413-ca79-4e82-90e1-f452bdc229a9.html ) . 
  [ here 's him in court . 
  ] ( http://www.businesspundit.com/10-business-execs-suspected-of-murder/ ) how does spreading lies help you ? 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/siemens-corruption-court-idusl8n1bi35s and maybe because the trial has n't ended yet ? 
  http://www.ekathimerini.com/213938/article/ekathimerini/news/siemens-trial-to-start-in-athens-on-feb-24 greece and germany are in schengen . 
  if a german citizen is convicted , he will go to jail . 
  heck france does not extradite any citizen , except to other schengen countries . 
   always wanted a child who browsed reddit . 
  you always wanted a redditor that browsed reddit ? 
  is n't that a pleonasm ? 
   why did they officially registered pussy riot brand in usa and eu , if they are punks ? 
  clearly the worst accusation out of all of them . 
   people from paris ... well ... they just shit on you :d a reverse cleaveland steamer . 
   you 've been saying it constantly whether you 've used the word or not . 
  `` stop being american , '' yeah stop thinking you can invade other countries because muh soverentaaay, 
   `` stupid american '' did i use the word stupid ? 
  how can you say you 're feeling great today ? 
  have you seem how pathetic steam sales have become ? 
  and there 's no more daily specials !, 
  oooohh we 're talking about brexit ?

   idiot can you talk without insulting or is that too difficult ? 
   https://data.oecd.org/pisa/science-performance-pisa.htm what ? 
  hey he reached reason in the end . 
  does n't matter how he got there . 
  holy shit you 're too full up american . 
  uurrrggg gunz are lawz, 
   paris would ... obviously you have n't met parisian women . 
   no , again , sovereign entities are n't bound to any authority higher than themselves . 
  yeah and netherlands is a sovereign country . 
   still , it 's not a good message to people who are not top managers . 
  france refuses to extradite its own citizens ( except to schengen countries ) ... full stop . 
  does n't matter what salary they have . 
   false equivalency . 
  do you understand the concent of examples ? 
  / u/ctudor says one should always extradite to the us because he ~ ~ 's a superior being that ~ ~ hates this `` tribalism '' . 
  well no . 
   you have to agree to extradite someone . 
  and the germans disagreed which they is fully their right to do . 
  us wo n't send amanda knox back , will they ? 
  no they wont https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/31/amanda-knox-not-return-italy-parents-meredith-kercher  the crime was committed in the us , it is their jurisdiction to prosecute those who commit crimes in their country .
