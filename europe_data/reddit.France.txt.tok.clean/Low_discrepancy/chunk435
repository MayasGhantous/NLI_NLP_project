  well they 're free to change their laws and trial people in absence . 
  they have the jurisdiction but they do n't have the accused . 
  that 's pretty pointless then . 
   the basic principle of national sovereignty is that the nation is a sovereign entity - there is no higher authority . 
  yes . 
  ** in your own fucking country ** . 
  do you not understand how borders work ? 
  hint : sovereigty does not extend beyond them . 
   ok , you were talking about french executives , so i did not understand your message the first time . 
  yeah . 
  if dacia starts a new project or use a new clio engine , do you think renault moves all their engineers there ? 
  no , they send them for a few months etc. 
  they become posted workers . 
   we are a sovereign nation . 
  so is every country on the globe . 
  when an american citizen commits an illegal act abroad , they get arrested . 
  in romania they committed illegal acts and since romania is under jurisdiction of the icp they can be tried by the icp . 
   and our government has not only the right , but the responsibility to protect us . 
  and under what international legal act do you have the right to invade another country ? 
  do you have the legal right to invade north korea because they imprisoned a dude that ripped a poster ? 
  does the us recognise the nkorean law stating that people can be sent to jail for ripping posters ? 
  yet here you are . 
  dude stop being american . 
  the us can not protect you in other sovereign nations . 
   for french expatriates we 're talking about posted workers . 
  and i should express my apologies for lafayette invading british sovereign soil in that tiny war of independence the rebels had . 
   america is not one of the fking examples you just threw did you bother to read my comment or did you go in kneejerk mode ? 
  should romania send its citizens to be executed in the us ? 
   the crime itself is not some backwards crappy shit . 
  well this is the part you do n't understand . 
  so what crimes do you extradite and what crimes you do n't ? 
  how do you legally define `` backwards crappy shit '' ? 
   if american high management would fk up smth big in europe and face criminal prosecution in germany we would fking scream the same to be prosecuted here . 
  yeah and ? 
  the us already refused to extradite amanda knox to italy . 
  the us '' '' '' '' '' '' `` tried '' '' '' '' '' 4 soldiers that killed 20 italians through some stupid and illegal shit they did , and they were found not guilty . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalese_cable_car_disaster_ ( 1998 ) drunk us soldier does n't stop at a stop sign and kills a romanian . 
  does n't go to trial https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/teo_peter  high fking management has to start fearing criminal law for their actions otherwise capitalism is doomed !, 
  then the us should send the charges to the german court since germany is n't a `` backwards crappy '' country . 
   if it tried to do so , it would be illegally abducting an american citizen , and yes i would want us to invade any country that did that . 
  are you so american that you do not understand you can not invade other countries without proper reason ? 
  and if you commit a crime in a different country , jurisdiction ** still ** applies for that country ? 
  for example romania and poland ratified the treaty and cia operated torture prisons in romania and poland . 
  just because you 're american does n't mean law does n't apply to you and you 're free to do whatever you want in whatever country you want . 
   it has no legal authority over americans . 
  what legal authority do you have to invade another country ? 
  well when a french goes to work is posted in another country , they do n't pay to the local retirement fund , but the french one . 
  preeeeetty sure poland would love to tax a high french salary . 
  also would you like to be posted in poland and when you retire , your pension to be much smaller because your company sent you in poland for a few years ? 
  all the french executives etc that are working with dacia \u00een romania would immediately want to return home . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_service-members%27_protection_act so when americans pass a law stating that they 'll invade netherlands if the ipc ever thinks about condemning an american citizen for committing war crimes , that 's all a democratic procedure ? 
   i do n't like this form protectionism aka tribalism : they might be crooks but they are ours so fk u murica !, 
  they will not imprison them they will just face prosecution ... wtf are you talking about ? 
  let 's say that one day you 're in saudi arabia and for 5 minutes your wife takes the wheel . 
  you 're not caught but footage of you is taken and when you come back to romania , the saudis start a penal procedure and ask for romania to extradite you . 
  what if you 're in romania and you burn a picture of kim jong un and nk asks for your extradition ? 
  what if you commit a crime in the us and the punishment you got is the death penalty ? 
  should romania send its citizens to be killed elsewhere ? 
  what about when romanians fled communism and were sentenced to death ? 
  should they have been sent back to be killed ? 
   and a judge and jury will decide what happens to them . 
  if you 're a citizen of country a and you 're now in country a you should be judged according to the laws of country a by judges from country a. 
  if the americans want to pursue this , they can send all the information to german police and german judges and let the germans judge the matter , since the person is not a german in germany . 
  edit : at least germany wo n't invade another country if a citizen is under trial . 
   for them to leave the country since most countries abide by interpol warrants . 
  they most likely can travel across the eu . 
   they are not paid french minimum wage . 
  they do n't respect french labor laws . 
  ** false ** http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/posted-workers/index_en.htm  minimum rates of pay : ** your wage may not be less than the local minimum wage or the wage set by binding collective agreements in your sector of employment , ** if these are in force in the host country, 
  what 's with the editorialisation of the title ? 
   towerblocks well towerblocks were designed as shit . 
  they 're not good in winter , they 're not good in summer . 
  higher windows and less roof insulation is n't good in winter either . 
  but that 's a general thing thing across europe . 
  they were designed in a period of time where building quantity was more important than quality . 
   our houses are stuffed with insulation , the heat does n't leave when it 's hot outside , you do n't stop heat from leaving . 
  you stop heat from entering . 
  neah italians have the best high velocity trains . 
  1st class is top notch . 
  am confused . 
  a house designed to retain heat is simply a house designed with good insolation . 
  that means that you block heat transfers so it cools downs from an inside source slower but it also warms up from an outside source slower too , which is a good thing . 
  unless you painted the roof and everything black and have a heat pump you can not turn off ,, 
  wait ? 
  what do you mean exposed ? 
  do you check people 's cocks when they prefer ? 
   even if the pope said there are not true chatolics they would just tell does n't matter what they 'd tell . 
  if the pope excommunicates you , you are no longer catholic by the very definition of catholic . 
  since the vast vast vast majority of muslims and the imams of france the french islamic council declared that terrorists are not french muslims , they are not french muslims . 
  if an imam in syria declares that they 're syrian muslims , then they 're syrian muslims . 
  what you patently refuse to understand is that if you have a muslim friend , he has ** the same probability ** to join isis as you have . 
  because you have the same experiences , same friends , same etc etc etc. 
  it is ridiculous to claim that he has a non-zero probability to join isis , while you have a zero probability because you 're not muslim . 
   that depends on which muslim you ask . 
  the vast majority of muslims in france . 
  since the vast majority of muslims in france dearest that they are not muslim , therefore they are not muslim . 
   white being white is not a set a beliefs . 
  being muslim is a set of beliefs and others have to accept you for being muslim . 
  if the pope states that you are not catholic , that means that you are not catholic , plain and simple . 
   so you concluding that muslims are `` inherently dangerous '' and therefore their countries should n't be allowed in the eu lacks perspective imo .
