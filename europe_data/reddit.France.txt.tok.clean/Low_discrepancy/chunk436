  but that is exactly what you are saying . 
  by looking at number of muslims vs how many joined isis , you immediately assume that there is something ** intrinsic ** in islam that turns people terrorist . 
  be it 1 in 3k or 1 in 25k there is a small probability that ** a muslim ** will turn terrorist * because * they are muslim . 
  it is intrinsic to their beliefs and as such they can not escape it . 
  take your favourite muslim friend and they 'll have a ** non-zero ** probability to join isis . 
  while you being non muslim , have a ** zero ** probability to join isis . 
  i believe that such a belief is severely misguided and severely wrong . 
  ** your muslim friend has the same probability to join isis as you have because you have the same circle of friends , same experiences , etc etc etc ** that is why when i calculate probability i divide ** by the whole population of france ** and not divide just by the population of muslims . 
  the fact that 1/4th of isis french terrorists are recent converts supports my view that is not a muslim community problem as you make it seem . 
   would white people call the kkk `` true whites '' ? 
  if the pope says you 're not catholic , are you still a catholic ? 
  no by the very definition of being catholic . 
   seriously now ? 
  that 's your argument ? 
  yes . 
  no imam in france or albania will call the terrorist muslims . 
  how can they be muslims if the vast majority of muslims declare they are not ? 
   just like any group does when there is a terrorists organization that claims to do acts in their name . 
  unfortunately that is n't enough to stop every fucked up idiot to believe the terrorists propaganda . 
  well they 're french , albanians etc as they have french , albanian etc passports . 
  and as such i judge them as french and as albanians . 
  isis is a radical-muslim movement . 
  the muslim community states that isis is not muslim and are committing unmuslim acts . 
  where as they are french since they hold french passport . 
  they are albanians since they hold albanian passports . 
  how many imams in france or in albania would openly declare : yeah the terrorists are muslims !, 
  you tell me . 
  that 's why i do n't do statistics based on muslim communities . 
  also 1/4 of isis members from france are converts http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/pourquoi-y-a-t-il-tant-de-convertis-parmi-les-djihadistes-francais-de-l-etat-islamique_1624282.html  so ... your stats of muslim/isis muslim look worse than theirs . 
  but obviously , ** since you look at just the muslim community ** that means you believe the muslim community holds inherent danger . 
  and who has a high muslim community ? 
   last time i checked isis is an islamic terrorist group so you 're talking specifically about muslims here . 
  last time i checked the muslim community states that isis are n't muslim . 
  so you tell me . 
   yes , and that 's why i explained that as a percentage of the muslim community of those countries , but muslims declare that isis are n't muslim . 
  and now you 're saying that they are muslims and that they draw heavily from the muslims community . 
  as such , having a muslim community seems dangerous , according to your analysis . 
  sure some may be more dangerous than others , but clearly the fact that the muslim community exists , is a danger . 
   we 're talking about radicalization of muslims since only muslims are dangerous , then is n't it better to not have any muslims then ? 
   stop grasping at straws trying to make it look like albania , bosnia or kosovo are having somekind of major problem with radicalization . 
  well you 're saying it 's a radicalisation of muslims . 
  you know who has a lot of muslims ? 
  albania bosnia and kosovo . 
   , he said that albania has the lowest chance of a muslim radicalising . 
  so only muslims can be radicalised then ? 
  clearly muslims are a danger then if only they can be radicalised . 
  akshually that 's a [ locomotive ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xgd9w ) . 
   i bet there is not a lot of non-muslims who joined isis , lol . 
  a lot of french , albanians , syrians , iraqis etc joined isis too . 
  and between those nationalities , albanians are much more numerous on a per capita basis of their nationality . 
  and inside they 're better than tgvs, 
  again , why are you only considering shares of muslim populations when looking at terrorism in france or belgium ? 
  are you saying that the muslim populations are dangerous ? 
   albania is majority muslim . 
  i 'm talking about terrorists here not muslims . 
   well yes , you look at per capita to see big vs small country in fairer terms , but . 
  albania ( and bosnia and kosovo ) have muslim majorities why are you bringing the fact that there 's a muslim majority in the country in this discussion ? 
  does that make them more dangerous ? 
  well i 'll keep that in mind when and if bosnia , kosovo or albania want to join the eu then . 
   per muslim population the lowest . 
  so you 're saying that a higher muslim population means a higher terrorist population ? 
  is that the argument you 're making ? 
  and a lower overall muslim population means fewer terrorists ? 
  quite an interesting comment from a kosovar which is in its majority muslim . 
   then france . 
  do you have any official statistics about the number of muslims in france ? 
  because i do n't . 
   how 's it irrelevant ? 
  in you just ca n't argue with certain people man . 
  roll eyes and move on because some people dont do logic . 
   ( that last one , well let 's just say that albania is far from the top exporter ) i meant in europe . 
   which is seriously tiny , when looking at a country of 3 million . 
  still large numbers per capita . 
  how else would you compare a huge country vs a small country ? 
   they prefer organized crime over religiously motivated stuff . 
  per capita , albania has one of the highest number of people that went to join isis, 
   tfw when the presence of military in almost every bigger city in europe is normal and necessary , what have you done ... 
  wait , do n't you need nato troops in the east ? 
  like just yesterday there was a thread about german troops in lithuania . 
   he 'll end his life on a wheelchair since then . 
  well that 's friggin optimistic is n't it ? 
   last time i checked poland was no. 1 germany trade partner . 
  dude , no way you think poland is the main destination of german imports and exports . 
  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/ poland is the 10th destination for german exports . 
  about half the size of china . 
   13 billion per year in exchange to free entrance to their market eh . 
  china buys much more france and germany than poland . 
  it is also a much bigger market . 
  they also invest in europe much more than poland . 
  citroen peugeot would have no existed without chinese help , the chinese are working with the french to build the nuclear powerplant in the uk . 
  yeah not like they had the first satellite , the first man in space , the first woman in space , mir and other stuff . 
   i do n't understand why norway is so low ( # 31 ) . 
  i just sent you a letter explaining why . 
  when you 'll receive it , you 'll know how good it is . 
  here we 're talking about russian estonians that decide to start a protest or whatever . 
  if 10 % of your population starts some sort of violent protest , you wo n't put all of them in jail will you ? 
  this is hypotheticals . 
   wannacry was not the result of encryption backdoors or backdoors in general . 
  the `` logic '' behind backdoors is that politicians tells us that only the good guys will have the keys to backdoors . 
  that was the same logic was applied for wcry and we can see that it failed extremelly badly .
