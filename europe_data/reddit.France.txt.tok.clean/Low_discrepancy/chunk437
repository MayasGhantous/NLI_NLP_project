  if you know that the good guy has a masterkey , you wo n't need to crack ** all ** the passwords of all the users . 
  you just need to crack the masterkey and you 'll get in everywhere . 
  inserting a backdoor in encryption algorithms ** is ** inserting an unwanted feature and as such it is hardly any different from a bug . 
   in the same leak that allowed the hackers to discover the exploit microsoft put out a patch , it just was n't applied to all computers . 
  that 's because someone decided to leak the info . 
  how do you know that other agencies did n't already use these bugs that the nsa collected ? 
  that will be unfortunate for those `` locals '' . 
   but russia will deny saying it is a civil war and russia has nothing to do with it . 
  then there wo n't be any russian troops on baltic soil . 
  and if an uprising does occur then the uprising will be stopped and the people from that region will be given some degree of autonomy but still be part of their baltic country . 
  you ca n't start slaughtering ethnic russians . 
  in ukraine it was n't like 3 russians started a war . 
  and heck in crimea not a lot of people complained about russian occupation . 
   very en vogue these days . 
  you know what they say about fashion right ? 
  it 's cyclical . 
  may macron merkel mazi\u00e8re . 
  the 4 ms of the apocalypse . 
  wtf do they have against encryption ? 
   they are only detrimental to our privacy . 
  they 're not just detrimental to privacy . 
  backdoors are bad for * anything * you do on the internet ( online banking , surfing , software installation ) . 
  if you think otherwise , one should check the recent nhs attack . 
  it was the result of backdoors being found out . 
  nothing will be safe because you can never be sure that the site you 're going to is the site it claims to be , the info you send can be easily read etc. 
  guess it got lost in translation . 
  really ? 
  do you have any sources for that ? 
   recreated in its pre-ww2 borders . 
  but it did n't . 
  carpatho-ukraine that was annexed by hungary in 38 went to the ussr , so the full border was not recreated . 
  ( ukrainians sure got screwed after 1918 ) . 
   it would be easier to agree with the french secularism side if it was n't hypocritical when it comes to nuns . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  do you means it 's not forbidden for nuns to take their kinds on school walks ? 
  well it was nice while it lasted lads . 
  gorgeous . 
  hope it wo n't be too difficult to maintain though . 
  see what products are exported/imported the most by state a or state b and put trade barriers on that . 
   i think he wants action , and rightly so . 
  like sanctions for us states that do n't implement the paris agreements . 
  if that happens , does that mean that france can ask for him to be put in the panth\u00e9on ? 
   i just think that people on here need to stop acting like their farts do n't stink . 
  while our farts do stink , we have rulers that wan na make a dutch oven . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/12/may-macron-online-terror-radicalisation your or my enemy is n't some german that thinks their country is better.your enemy is your ruler than wants to fuck over your rights . 
  my enemy is my ruler that wants to fuck over my rights . 
   any way to that german proposal . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/27/downing-street-amber-rudd-authorities-access-encrypted-messages-whatsapp-terrorism https://eblnews.com/video/germany-govt-spy-personal-messaging-stringent-surveillance-laws-announced-130525  in many cases we are dealing with end-to-end encryptions , which means that we need to enter at the end or the beginning of a conversation rather than intercept inbetween . 
  it 's ** exactly ** the same position . 
  but continue believing that you 're special . 
   that 's stasi-tier stuff . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-rudd-iduskbn16x0be  uk minister says encryption on messaging services is unacceptable heil tovarish, 
   not even theresa may has come up with an idea like that . 
  you sure about that ? 
  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/30/investigatory_powers_act_backdoors/ what is `` electronic protection '' and why do you wan na remove such a thing ? 
   , i want them to pack their shit and fuck off . 
  are you spanish ? 
  do you have spanish citizenship ? 
  do you at least pay taxes in spain ? 
  do you pay local taxes in that city ? 
  then stfu !, 
   iraq was a believable one though , lets not forget saddam hussein used chemical weapons and genocide tactics during the anfal genocide and chemical and biological weapons during the iran-iraq war . 
  so there was a track record for the use of wmd used to help burn down some 4,500 villages and 3 cities . 
  halabja chemical attack is the largest chemical attack on a city in history , killing ~ 5,000 and injuring 10,000 . 
  so im not gon na lose sleep over killing that man . 
  we may have gotten it wrong but we got it wrong on the side that killed the bastard . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  we 're talking about ** nuclear wmds ** . 
  collin powell said that in his un speech . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/05/iraq.usa bush made many statements about irak `` nucular '' program . 
  https://www.armscontrol.org/print/1361 even though we knew that it was all bs . 
   so im not gon na lose sleep over killing that man . 
  an american wo n't lose sleep about invading a country and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians ? 
  oh my , colour me surprised . 
   unimaginable you do n't need to try and imagine it . 
  there 's pics of the building . 
   this essentially means scotland 's debt per capita is lower . 
  scottish deficit is at 9 % . 
  so while the debt now is smaller , it is increasing at a way faster rate than uks debt . 
  as is today , scotland would not be accepted in the eu . 
   furthermore , scotland is the only n1 region with a positive balance of trade . 
  yet scotland still spends far far more than it is generating through trade . 
  and before going full on independence ... you should realise that scotland 's main partner by a wide margin is the rest of uk . 
  so be careful how you tread . 
   does imply that the uk is draining the economy of scotland ; so this is all the fault of the uk ? 
  if scotland were independent , it would have no debt ? 
   we 're economically drained now that 's not the fault of uk is it ? 
   lied about syrian chem weapons well the us did lie about iraqi wmds ... which resulted in the destabilization of the region . 
  which resulted in the iraqi shia sunni civil war which helped greatly fuel isis . 
   i checked he and the united states in general have not annexed territory if the us pulls out of the iranian agreement , the resulting war will make eastern ukraine look like a small baby . 
  the us with republican presidents has been generally not really good for global and european stability . 
  27 a nice . 
   while macron 's party will have more than two-thirds of the seats , giving macron the ability to do whatever . 
  stop talking out of your ass dude . 
  macron + modem will get at most 455 seats . 
  so that 's two parties already . 
  to obtain 3/5th of senate + na , he need 555 seats . 
  he 's at a loss of 100 seats . 
   and trump supporters do n't want a police state . 
  so that 's why he 's constantly attacking the media ?
