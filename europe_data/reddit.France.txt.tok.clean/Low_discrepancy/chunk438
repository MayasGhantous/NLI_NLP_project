   part of trump 's job will be to dismantle the surveillance network obama has setup . 
  just like when he 'll drain the swamp and stop selling guns to terrorist states . 
  [ hail big brother ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/12/may-macron-online-terror-radicalisation ), 
   compared to countries of similar wealth the performance is way ahead . 
  there is no obvious pattern depending on wealth or whatever . 
  https://qz.com/931253/the-highest-share-of-women-in-the-workforce-globally-are-found-in-these-african-countries/  and in arbitrary fields and measurements the east outperforms the west in sex equality . 
  so sex equality is larger in ee because more women work in tech ? 
   eastern europe has much higher participation of women overall . 
  any source for that . 
  http://hdr.undp.org/fr/content/labour-force-participation-rate-female-male-ratio ratio of female to male shares in 2012 : * sweden .88 * france .82 * germany .8 * poland .75 * romania .75 * hungary .75, 
   get ready for this , poland and hungary  is that why we 're seeing so many germans moving to poland and hungary ? 
  terrorism comes and goes . 
  russia will be there forever . 
  start ponying up for nato troops . 
   eu sanctions czechs , poles and hungarians over refugee policy , 
   have a nice evening !, 
  & nbsp ;  eu sanctions czechs , poles and hungarians over refugee policy tis a nice evening . 
   tis a very very nice evening . 
  getting closer and closer to multispeed eu too . 
   do n't be surprised we do not want to pay anymore for ee . 
   our economies are so tightly connected , that nobody would make it without significant lossess . 
  china is a more important market for france and germany than poland is . 
   that 's why we 's bragging about unity , solidarity and equality amongst eu member states is a blatant lie and hypocrisy . 
  same goes for ee that demands unity , solidarity and equality while bitching about equal distribution of refugees to help greece or italy or implementing european wide worker rights or european wide minimum wages . 
  it 's all a sham and the quicker it ends , the better for everybody . 
  i can see a union of western countries and a union of eastern countries but the eu in its current form has no purpose of being . 
  we have little common values and ambitions . 
  think the message here is to not start killing muslims because omg mosleeems are terroriztz . 
  the fact that huge crowds can be very dangerous and easily scared is not a new things . 
  we has total domination over the eu . 
  that 's a reality . 
   were 1/3 of population voted for basically france leaving eu if we 'll dislike what the eu becomes we 'll leave . 
  see , it 's simple . 
  france will forever be a minority in the eu just like ee will forever be a minority with respect to western europe . 
  western europe will dictate what the eu will look like because they 're the most numerous in population and they created the eu . 
  that 's simple reality . 
  no need to get emotional or get pissy.it 's reality . 
   but i guess hypocrisy and acting now are eu values . 
  i see you 're polish . 
  you shuld vote to leave the eu then . 
  china buys more from germany and france than poland . 
   what 's wrong with that ? 
  ask your pm, 
   they are not the problem they ** are ** a problem to greece and italy . 
   should we allow them to break the law and do whatever they demand ? 
  you can not refuse people that come from warzones to apply for asylum . 
  it 's against ** international law ** ;, 
   securing the border what about the refugees already in greece and italy and the fact that those countries are strugling with that ? 
   thing is no one can tell how much of an impact it will have . 
  you said you want to solve the problem at the source . 
  the source is syria and other war zones . 
   they offered help no one simply listens so they offered money to syria , jordany , turkey and other places that have refugees and those countries said no ? 
  how much did they offer ? 
   the eu decided to go after the symptoms not the cause . 
  poland hungary and the czech republic are free to go after the symptoms and solve them without the eu holding them by the hand . 
  france will give 1 billion euros to tunisia for example to help development . 
   i 'm sure you would n't like hearing a dutch person saying that about romanians ? 
  do n't you know ? 
  if a wener complains about ee , then that person is a xenophobe . 
  if a eener complains about gypsies , then they 're just using their common sense . 
   greece having too many immigrants is a greece problem , the eu decided to help . 
  again if that 's a problem , countries are free to leave the eu . 
   for not fallowing our own imposed quotas . 
  where did you quote that ? 
  because i can actually spell to follow . 
   i mean , if you keep doing that eurosceptisim will sure reach other countries just like it reached uk . 
  so we should have allowed uk to restrict eu immigrant benefits ? 
  is that what you 're trying to say ? 
   illegal immigrants we 're talking about refugees here . 
   but do n't bitch about us not taking any , neither them nor we want them here . 
  no one 's bitching . 
  we simply implements sanctions . 
  if the sanctions bother ee countries , leaving the eu will mean that they wo n't have to abide by eu regulations , laws and agreements . 
  see , it 's pretty easy no need to get overly emotional , as you seem to be behaving . 
   which by the way is kinda uber democratic . 
  and the democratic rulers of greece , italy , france , germany want the democratic leaders of poland to accept some refugees and unload italy and greece . 
  we takes in refugees wherever they come from . 
  we took hungarians , romanians , russians , polish , after palestinians , kurdish , now syrians and afghans . 
   whatever that means . 
  ask the greeks swamped with refugees what fair repartition of refugees means . 
  cameron sa\u00efd many a thing . 
  that immediately after the brexit vote he 'll trigger art 50 . http://openeurope.org.uk/daily-shakeup/cameron-government-would-promptly-trigger-article-50-in-the-event-of-a-leave-vote/, 
   biological and chemical weapons . 
  how did iraq get its biological and chemical capabilities under saddam hussein then ? 
   you need to fit warhead on modern ballistic missile , design fuse and failsafe systems and myriad other issues - compare it to current tests that north korea is performing . 
  which is no small feat .

  these are countries that have had for a long time slbms . 
  i doubt any of the countries you mentio would be able to have at least a slbm launch capability in 2-3 years . 
  you can elect them for whatever reason you want . 
  the only rule 1 person 1 vote . 
   `` the fact of the commission without violence , constraint , threat or surprise of a sexual offence by an adult on the person of a minor under fifteen years of age is punished by five years ' imprisonment and a fine of $ 75,000 . '', 
  i do n't think this law would apply in the current case . 
  what do you think other barny ? 
  can we negociate with each other ? 
   you should hire the most qualified people . 
  this is an election not a hiring process . 
  mods should put a list of parody accounts on the wiki page so people do n't knee jerk vote accounts like / u/executivemonkey, 
  heck even a carrot guillotine would suffice .
