  i 'll be quite happy if a few ee countries leave the eu . 
   of 10 central europeans that visit france , 9 are sent back ? 
   ut of the money your goverment gives them in order to relocate back to romania . 
  that stopped in 2012 . 
  now they just one ticket home . 
    gotte get all that free money plus they can cough earn more in the west . 
  they do n't get any more money . 
  you should check that cough though . 
   romania for more than a month before they are on the move towards france so do romanians want romania to be left out of the eu because obviously borders do n't work and romanians ca n't be held in their country ? 
  because i ca n't stop seeing ee complaining how they should n't get refugees because they ca n't keep them in the country . 
   yeah calais in pas-de-calais you do realise that calais is just ** one ** part of nord-pas-de-calais , right ? 
  have you ever left your island ? 
   the rural communities in the provence that border the arabized cities ( such as marseille ) are strongholds of front national . 
  up to 50 % of the vote . 
  let 's take the most `` arabic '' city of them all . 
  paris . 
  look at that . 
  no one around paris voted le pen . 
  wtf ? 
   on the other hand , communities in bretagne , which have almost no arabs/muslims around , are voting for mainstream candidates . 
  mind your own country buddy . 
  they were granted refugee status so by definition of what means to be a refugee , they 're refugees . 
   did the comimisision bother to ask if these people want to come here ? 
  they do n't want to stay in greece or italy either . 
  what 's your point ? 
  asylum is n't friggin shopping . 
   what are we supposed to do with them once they try and take a hike to germany ? 
  put a fence , barbed wire ? 
  shoot on site ? 
  you 're not supposed to do anything . 
  germany will send them back home once they 're caught on german soil . 
  that 's what we do with ee and eu citizens we catch in france that do n't have the means to live here . 
  we sent 13k back home just in 2015 . 
   relocating people who do n't want to be in poland they also do n't want to remain in greece or italy . 
  nope . 
  we do n't know it . 
  they 've been granted refugee status . 
  they 're refugees by definition . 
   they are not effectively being forced to do so . 
  again they do n't have the right to move in another country . 
  just like gypsies can not move in france if they have no means to live here . 
  that 's why we expulsed 13k of them in 2015 . 
  you see a polish refugee on your territory ? 
  you send him back home . 
  it works no different to any other system . 
   politics is a tournament of psychopaths . 
  the eu is no exception , neither is my czechia proper . 
  have you seen your president ? 
  the statements he makes ? 
  i 'd really avoid making statements about other countries with rulers like that ... 
  really ? 
  because polls really do n't show that . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/29/did-britain-really-vote-brexit-to-cut-immigration/ * 1 ) sovereignty issues * 2 ) immigration * 3 ) having a say about who gets to join the eu or not . 
  i reheheheally doubt leavers cared much about the eurozone . 
   refugees * 1 ) berlin was n't a refugee but someone that was refused asylum * 2 ) munich was the kid of a refugee iirc . 
  so what are you talking about ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ( dangerzone ), 
  i did n't talk about america . 
  you were replying to a thread replying this :  i do n't know , right now it 's just the u.s. and britain acting silly right now . 
  they french gave me a little hope . 
  okay fine let 's talk about france . 
   the milquetoast liberal 's victory is neither inspirational or a paradigm shift . 
  so the guy that : * never was elected before ** in any position ** won directly the presidency * first president since 1958 ( actually before ) not from a major party * will bring a majority in parliament to a party that ** did n't exist 1 year ago ** * first centrist and first non big party majority since 1958 is ** not ** a change of paradigm ? 
  and : * the youngest president under the french republic ( so 200 years give or take ) , * a party that will win majority and has ** [ 1/3 of parliamentary candidates starting in politics just now ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2017/06/07/legislatives-un-tiers-des-candidats-de-la-republique-en-marche-sont-de-vrais-novices-en-politique_5139798_4355770.html ) ** is ** not ** inspirational ? 
   those problems are still going to be with you in 5 years . 
  maybe yes , maybe no . 
  but here 's the thing , at least we know we have problems . 
  that 's why we 're trying to find solutions and we 're doing new things . 
  you americans still live in a world where everything is fine or if you 're a dem , you probably still think : eh in 3 years will vote him out and we 'll go back to normal , because trump 's appearance on the political scene was totally a fluke , guys !, 
   he only got 24 % of the vote in the first round . 
  yeah dude , that 's how normal elections work instead of your retarded two party system . 
  it was a vote against fascism , pure and simple . 
  not a vote for him you americans did n't even muster to do ** this ** simple thing . 
  we 've been told for ages how wrong us french are doing everything , how great the us is at doing everything . 
  look black president , look how low unemployment after the crisis , look the french have terrorist at , the dumbasses . 
  yet you voted the fascist cheeto benito and 2/3rd of french voted no to that . 
  so no , you do n't get to comment on other people 's politics when you vote in an idiot that does n't know how to shake hands and wants to ban muslims from entering the country . 
  oh , and before commenting next time on a thread about human rights that the usis n'tthat bad , let it sink in that ** even ** marine le pen gave up the promise to implement the death penalty ( only have a ref on it ) while ** both ** us candidates are in favour of it . 
  so yeah , americans stfu . 
  he 's a guy that had no party and was never elected before . 
  how much will he get in the parliamentary elections huh ? 
  and what 's your issue with fillon and melenchon ? 
  at least fillon never said he 'll reduce abortion rights and voted to eliminate the death penalty . 
  while ** both ** major us candidates were in favour of the death penalty . 
  really dude , you do n't get to comment . 
   point : she was both polish , and french . 
  how 's that relevant in a discussion about the greatest french of the 20th century ? 
   and two , her major discovery is in 1898 , so she belong for the greatest of the xix century . 
  said the guy that called de gaulle the most important man of the 21st century . 
   her french heritage is disputed ( see below ) . 
  by whom ? 
  she ' buried in the friggin pantheon . 
   she never lost her polish identity one having a different identity does not mean they 're not french . 
  napoleon was n't french born was he ? 
  she took a french citizenship , a french name that you so kindly crossed out . 
  guess you know what 's best right ? 
  her children and son in laws had a significant influence in france . 
   greatest man of france for the xxth century , and the xxi st , so far . 
  i believe france has had greater people marie curie for example . 
  her work was fundamental in physics and her offsprings and heirs to her intellectual legacy ( daughter and son in law ) were essential in creating cnrs and cea .
