  maybe one of the greatest politicians but france change enormously since his days . 
  no shame in voting for someone that will bring your vision of what your country should be . 
  well keep voting pis man . 
  :d you 're doing god 's work . 
   there are some limitations , yeah . 
  those limitations are for `` reasonable '' job offers and they 're defined by law and quite precise . 
  what macron wants : https://en-marche.fr/emmanuel-macron/le-programme/emploi-ch%c3%b4mage-securites-professionnelles * two `` decent '' job offers ( * he offers no definition for what decent job offer means * ) * job seeking intensity/eagerness is n't sufficient ( * wtf is a job seeking eagerness ? 
  so you wo n't mind we 'll just give eu funds to eurozone countries . 
   for people who refuse 2 jobs offers , not 2 simultaneous jobs . 
  pardon my french but duh !, 
   well , it 's already the requirement at pole emploi for job seekers , currently . 
  https://www.recours-radiation.fr/radiation-pour-refus-de-2-offres-demploi-raisonnables.html currently the system is quite lax . 
  his system https://en-marche.fr/emmanuel-macron/le-programme/emploi-ch%c3%b4mage-securites-professionnelles if : * you refuse two ** decent ** job offers * your job seeking intensity is n't deemed sufficient . 
  wtf is a `` decent '' job offer ? 
  he offers no definition for that there 's a definition for reasonable but decent is something macron came up with . 
  and job seeking intensity ? 
  wtf is that ? 
  the soldiers are fighting under the orders of those politicians . 
  if you do n't like the politicians , of course they should leave . 
  you do realise they paid into the system right ? 
  that they contributed for unemployment ? 
   that 's how it works anywhere else in the world . 
  yeah no . 
  do you actually have a job or are you a typical student that has no idea what labour laws are ? 
   in the ussr for example it was illegal to be unemployed and you either did the job the government gave to you or you got imprisoned . 
  where did you take your history lessons from ? 
  dude . 
  turkey does n't let politicians go visit the troops . 
  wtf ? 
   this is abandoning turkey during perhaps the worst time of its history in terms of terror and regional risks . 
  but i 'm sure that if we ask erdogan , turkey is very powerful now . 
  and well people did kinda vote for him did n't they ? 
  finals are a bitch . 
   eh , not really . 
  stopping unemployment benefits for people who refuse two jobs is quite extreme . 
  what if they 're totally not suitable . 
  givem them full unemployment benefits if they quit work instead of full benefits just if they 're fired for economic reasons . 
   in a mind of every rational human guys pack it up . 
  we found the perfect ration human on / r/reddit . 
   just emotional garbage . 
  sorry to tell you buddy but  french have some kind of odd fetish for socialism , oversized social benefits , oversized working rights , lack of market flexibility and so on is n't argumentation . 
  it 's just your regular knee jerk reactions . 
  good for you for feeling superior but that 's not based on facts . 
  https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=rmw germany has a bit higher minimum wage . 
  in terms of social rights , germans have about the same rights in terms of medical care or university costs . 
  [ germans also work less than french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_time ) . 
  but then again germany has really shitty demographics meaning they do n't really have to care about youth unemployment that much because they do n't really have a ton of youth while in france that is an issue . 
  also it 's nice to see that / u/problemy offered a different yet also comprehensive answer . 
   sweden would n't be allowed to opt out . 
  does sweden have an opt-out ? 
   eu then countries like uk how long will uk remain in the eu ? 
  what 's that proof for you ? 
  a country that did n't commit to the eu is leaving the eu ? 
  wow such a huge surprise . 
   the most important process is entering the single market do you understand the difference between single market and the eu ? 
   when some other alternative than keeping immigrants locked in camps not allowing them to run away west appears , are gypsies kept in camps in romania ? 
  when they come to france , they 're sent back . 
  see . 
  it 's simple . 
   forcing people to stay somehwere they do n't want to be seems pretty inhumane to me . 
  are gypsies forced to stay in romania ? 
  do you understand that the eu does n't mean you can move anywhere you want ? 
  you should recheck what the eu actually is since you have a very mixed up view of it . 
  single market , schengen , eu . 
  it all seems to be one big thing for you when it 's not . 
  after you review these things , you 'll see that indeed poland picks and chooses what it wants ... and that no longer is acceptable . 
   we 'll have a multi-speed eu because we already have it . 
  we 'll just have to push harder for it because people are getting tired of poland 's nonsense . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/merkel-backs-idea-of-multispeed-europe-at-versailles-meet/a-37833273 poland wants the eu to remain where it is , and that simply is no solution . 
   when exactly i have no clue so no clue when poland will engage ** in the most important eu process to date ** ? 
  ok . you really showed me how invested poland is . 
   put your emotions aside , think of countries more like businesses okay . 
  when will poland accept refugees from countries like greece and italy ? 
   you also do n't know multi speed europe will happen okay fine . 
  ** tell me when poland will join the eurozone . 
   but still how 's that namecalling ? 
  answer the question . 
   that 's the main and only needed reason . 
  well that is not a reason , sorry to say . 
  again it is much more important to me and my fellow frenchmen to see italy come out of its struggles than poland . 
   since they are n't in the eu you have no say over how they act . 
  poland does n't even want to join the euro . 
  multi-speed eu will happen because it already is happening . 
  what future projects can we do if these countries do n't want to move forward ? 
  i 'd rather help greece that has shown committment to the european project than poland that decides to bail everytime they do n't like a situation . 
  see euro or the refugee crisis . 
  the day poland will be a net contributor to the eu budget will be the day poland will be thinking about a polexit . 
   so for every euro invested in poland you know for sure at least 75 cents go to benefit you , and you can make that number higher , while investing in china results in 20 cents benefiting you and over 50 cents benefiting other asian countries , holy shit . 
  / r/badeconomics dude . 
  that 's not how any of it works . 
  how 's that namecalling ? 
  dude it 's a reality . 
  we do n't give a fuck about poland . 
  heck we actually dislike poland a bit , so i guess the opposite of not caring . 
  so what / u/towram was correct . 
  if the form bothers you , do n't read reddit . 
  go to bbc where they do n't use curse words . 
  but still ** how 's that namecalling ? 
   how is it relevant to the discussion about eurozone ? 
  how is / u/mysterious _ manny calling / u/towram a drama queen relevant to the discussion about eurozone ?
