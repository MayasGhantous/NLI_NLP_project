  if namecalling bothers you , here 's a hint ... go to the source of the problem , 
   it would mostly benefit asia , their main trading partner asia and china are far larger trading partners to germany than poland is . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_germany twice as larger and the potential is much much larger . 
  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/fra/ from france , china has bought 3-4 times more than poland did . 
   that 's why it 's smarter to invest in your neighbours first , but if that is done then sure go around investing somewhere else , the richer economies are the better for you , it 's not that hard . 
  exactly . 
  portugal , italy , spain , ireland . 
  we agree on that issue . 
   the richer your neighbours are the more they are willing to pay for your work , again , it really is n't complicated . 
  why should france invest so much money in a small partner like poland when it can invest in much larger partners like china ? 
  heck china bothers to invest back , see for example psa ( peugeot + citroen ) that was saved with the help of chinese money , see hinkley point which is a chinese and french project . 
  we either favour local , then again poland wouldnt be the best destination , or we invest where we can get the most money for the amount invested . 
  and that again is n't poland . 
  so what other reason to invest in poland other than well they 're in europe , eu and all that thing ... 
     the good ol' times of that bloody `` austerity '' , pushed really hard by our german friends ... yeah . 
  because usually conservatives are big big fans of govt spending . 
  heck fillon that wanted to cut 100 billion that 's because he was an avatar of merkel or something . 
  not because that 's his ideology . 
   what are you trying to achieve by offending polish people on this subreddit ? 
  how is it offensive to point out that the new king of poland is jesus christ , the fact that poles saw themselves as a christ of nations and that the pm of poland was against naming a polish guy as president of the eu council . 
  tell me did i get any of those facts wrong ? 
  ok . you 're free to negociate a lease with an african country . 
  what 's stopping poland from achieving that . 
   will your inactive mena people start working ? 
  maybe zidane will come back . 
  that 'll be cool , would n't it ? 
   today , the rif is the world 's leading cannabis producing region , fuelling organised crime in the rif , across the whole of morocco , and among the riffian diaspora in europe . 
  once again something that should be legal fuels crime ... 
   this i do not understand and should change . 
  it 's more complicated than it seems . 
  what if you do research on isis and isis related propaganda ? 
  does that mean that if you wan na do research on isis material you 'll need special warrants from the police ? 
  what if you 're a journalist or a writer that wants to publish a book on isis material ? 
  what if you 're a weird politician that posts an isis beheading like marine le pen did on her twitter account ? 
  should she go to jail for that ? 
  and every person that actually clicked on that link ? 
   finding isis material is not something you get by accident either what if you go to a weird site , get a virus and the virus downloads isis material ? 
   it 's proven time and time again that monitoring alone is just not enough when each and every one of them is known and has had isis material . 
  a implies b does not mean b implies a. 
  do you know how many people have isis material on their computers ? 
  how do you define isis material ? 
  a photo ? 
  anything more than 1gb of stuff ? 
  no need to get salty . 
  there is a french system of value and there is a polish system of values . 
  the french system of values is much much closer to spanish , italian , portuguese than polish . 
  that 's why we 're seeing rifts form . 
  wait you mean to say that no french eu money went to poland ? 
  we can invest in brazil then . 
  it has way way more capacity to import than any other european country . 
  but we do n't invest in countries based on their economic potential , do we ? 
   the goal should be to help poland improve to become a richer nation , why ? 
  id rather give my tax money to spain or italy or portugal or heck ireland ( to offset fiscal issues that will appear ) . 
  they are much closer to our systems of values and cooperate much more than countries like poland or hungary . 
  well romania is let 's say twice as small yet it seems to receive 3 times less money . 
  let 's see what the title says : `` eu budget : average net contribution by member state '', 
  you follow me religiously i see , yet i am not [ jesus your new king ] ( http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2016/november/poland-declares-jesus-king-of-the-country ) . 
  how come . 
   germany and france casually forget the eu is n't just them . 
  that mindset drove uk out of the eu duuuuuude . 
  it was poland that drove uk out of the eu . 
  uk was in the eu for decades before poland joined . 
  in 12 year polish people managed to invade uk leech off benefits and of course brits wo n't be happy with that . 
  you think british mind french and german migrants ? 
  you think cameron wanted to reduce benefits for french and german migrants ? 
   germany and france are tone deaf and did n't get the hint . 
  wtf are you talking about . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/12041452/poland-promises-to-stand-ground-with-cameron-over-eu-welfare-demands.html https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/06/poland-warns-david-cameron-over-eu-referendum http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-david-cameron-told-by-eastern-bloc-countries-his-benefits-plan-is-unacceptable-a6877901.html https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/17/four-eu-states-reject-camerons-migrant-benefits-plan http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/12022818/cameron-digs-heels-in-over-plan-to-scrap-benefits-for-eastern-european-workers.html https://www.ft.com/content/ecdc7932-b48a-11e5-8358-9a82b43f6b2f two words for you : ** migrant benefits ** . 
  had germany told uk : ok guys we 'll let you remove migrant benefits then cameron would have returned victorious from negociations to his people and remain would have won . 
  instead cameron got a bashing from countries like poland and the czech republic and of course the brits could n't stand that . 
  we present drama queen country poland . 
  sit back and enjoy the [ christ among nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe ) . 
   of course a sentence by 1 politician did n't trigger a refugee crisis . 
  & nbsp ;  merkel did so which one is it ? 
   you 're quite a drama queen , are n't you ? 
  maybe / u/towram is a drama queen . 
  but you come from a country where the friggin pm opposed an eu position for a person ** from the same country ** . 
   eu not eurozone ... some countries are less equal here ya go . 
   wait you think eurozone countries are as equal as non eurozone countries ? 
   merkel did maybe you should revise your numbers . 
  eastern europe was already sunk in asylum seekers and others ** waaaaay ** before merkel said anything . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/40nru4/dear_europeans_what_are_the_most_astonishing_or/cywinxb/ here you go , an easy to read to show you how things actually happened instead of how you imagine they happened . 
   if we did n't invite people to illegally enter europe how exactly do we invite people to enter illegally in europe . 
  calm down keyboard warrior . 
  calm down . 
   it 's also not a good idea to open borders if borders were open people would n't die trying to cross the med . 
   yeah , and they 're oh so efficient at it . 
  how do you define efficiency ? 
  we do it pretty quickly in france . 
   czarnecki advised britain to remove `` radical migrants '' , saying : `` if a radical muslim leader calls his brothers-in-faith at the mosque ... to fight with the unfaithful then i believe there are grounds to expel that imam '' news flash . 
  ** that already is happening ** . 
   where do you think modern western law and culture comes from ? 
  germanic paganism ? 
  nope , christianity . 
  current human rights stem from a reaction to feudalism or absolutist monarchies ( magna carta , french declaration of human rights ) . 
  it was christianity that gave feudalists and absolute monarchs the `` divine right to rule '' . 
  democracy did n't form at the vatican . 
  you should read up your history . 
  so let poland find where to put them, 
  terrorism does n't really affect 99.99999 % of the population .
