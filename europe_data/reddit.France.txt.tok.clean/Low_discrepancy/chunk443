  unemployment affects 10 % of the population in france . 
  you do the maths , 
  terrorist attacks does n't affect you . 
  becoming unemployed does . 
  but you being a pole will naturally praise the free market since you benefit from it . 
  more like a women 's rights liberal . 
  no politician put his hands inside the vagina of any woman and smother the foetus . 
  he has his religion , we have the rule of law . 
  what do you want to do ? 
  put in job offers : `` no muslims allowed ! '' ? 
  start a trump muslim ban ... that was rendered useless ** in his own country ** ? 
  does n't work like that since those people are nutters . 
   leftist someone called / r/europe leftist : o i wan na meet that redditor . 
  dude since you know so much about their family , you should speak to the police . 
  they might get some useful information from you . 
   they could have european passports for 2 generations and never integrated so do you know they never integrated ? 
  well italy never was a french colony yet italian terrorists still killed a french president . 
  maybe shit 's more complicated, 
  how do you know that none of the parents of these people are n't british citizens ? 
   `` the nation that gave the world the magna carta is dead '' myes . 
  totally level headed people that were banned there . 
  no such thing . 
  you also do n't get infinite refills . 
   it 's a bit insulting for them who actually went through the trouble while others went the low road and do n't even get deported ever . 
  what 's their issue with illegals ? 
  do dey terk der jeerbs ? 
   during a phd application at a state-run norwegian company , my application was rejected . 
  the only reason offered was a clause that required all future phd applicants to speak fluent norwegian . 
  the point : all your experience and degrees count for naught if you do n't speak an obscure language . 
  so you go to a ** state-run ** company and ask for ** tax paid ** phd scholarship and insult their requirements for an `` obscure '' language ? 
  norway tax payers have the right to ask the requirement that they only give phd scholarships to people that are integrated in norwegian society . 
  this also significantly prevents brain drain . 
  if you do n't invest in the country , you 'll bail as soon as you 're offered a better job elsewhere . 
  no one has time for that . 
   i live in the netherlands and dutch is spoken only in the netherlands and a part of belgium . 
  spoken by just 20 million people ... must take like 3 days to get to know all of them . 
  and a country of 20 million people is definitely too small for your ambitions ? 
  is n't it ? 
  you 're already fluent in mandarin and spanish i bet . 
   i would learn the language of the land i live in but there must be a long-term plan . 
  i lose the incentive to learn if i know my investment could be rendered useless by a move to another country . 
  & nbsp ;  at the lower end of the wage and skills chart , eu salaries are higher than in other oecd countries but it is the middle class above that is squeezed well that 's your issue right there . 
  you see any choice you make as `` an investment '' and you hope to capitalise from it later on . 
  learning a language is n't an investment that you hope to extract money from , you do it to better understand a culture . 
  you do n't do a cost benefit analysis for that . 
  moving to a country is much much more than what salary they offer to the middle class . 
  life is more complicated than a bank account . 
   this country had the foresight to acknowledge that people such as myself have skills that they need and can contribute to their economies with near zero investment from them . 
  just in the last few years we gave french citizenship to two very promising researchers that went out to win fields medals . 
  in france if you 're an exceptional individual you get citizenship easily . 
  if you have masters degrees it 's also easier ( only 3 years of residence ) . 
  seems to me like you 're just plain frustrated for your situation ( hence the irrelevant rant about norway ... which is n't even in the eu ) and the reality of your circumstances do not fit your image of them ( `` world 's best and brightest '' ) . 
  it sounds more like a rant , your comment and i can understand why that 's the case . 
  that norway is n't in the eu ? 
  is that your point ? 
  not all planes need windows actually . 
   let me remind you that he faced 20 years yes and the discussion was whether to pardon him or not . 
   he has to serve hard time . 
  oh yes . 
  let 's see how this criminal was received back home : https://youtu.be/ajoomsyuxdo?t=1m49s http://www.timesofisrael.com/soldier-charged-with-killing-wounded-palestinian-freed-for-passover/ such a hard time he 'll have . 
  if there had been no video , he 'd still be walking free today . 
  ** he was not arrested after the shooting ** or stopped by any other person https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keeuerdnl0e he assassinated the stabber and everybody around was \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   if the rest of the arab world recognises israel and stops being hostile , then im sure israe hey guys , it 's settled . 
  / u/giveme50dollars is ** sure ** israel will recognise palestine . 
   is by pointing your fingers at extremists who are shunned by mainstream israeli society . 
  so when the soldier that assassinated the palestinian stabber got only 18 months in jail , was allowed to go home for passover and treated like a hero in his neighbourhood , that 's just an example of `` an extremist minority '' ? 
   right now palestine is just a terrorist state . 
  and israel is a colonial state . 
   if you make it public people can help find their associates we did it reddit !, 
   terrorist attack happens --  `` it was a lone wolf '' --  looks like the westminster attack ** was ** a lone wolf . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/01/all-12-people-arrested-over-westminster-attack-released-without-charge but you probably know something the police does n't . 
  true . 
  i doubt china has anything similar to touquet agreement so we should also stop that . 
   you do know jews were very supportive of soviet occupation and were collaborating with soviets on one side , the jews had people that killed 95 % of them . 
  on thr other , not that . 
   5 $ would get you at least 4 of those , it 's 2.3 euros in france . 
  lithuania was exceptionally efficient in killing its jewish population though . 
  i 'm sure trump will protect you , 
  wait ? 
  there 's a mcdonald 's `` meal '' in paris for under 5euros ? 
  : o a mcfish + small fries is over 5 euros and it 's not at all filling . 
  did op cause the demolition of that church ? 
  then what you 're talking about ? 
  will you also bitch about smoking restrictions because hitler was in favour of those ? 
   young people who can barely afford the trip they 're making and so eat cheaply occasionally . 
  mcdonald 's are never the cheapest option . 
  who goes to different countries on vacation and eats mcdonald 's ? 
  if you 're going to micky d for flavour , you 've done something very wrong . 
  how about uk ? 
  never let a good tragedy go to waste . 
  blink twice if the tories are holding you hostage . 
  remember to not post anything too controversial . 
   so they had a duty towards us anyway . 
  why ? 
   apparently a barrier of a metro stop fell down due to the weight of the numerous people there and the thud scared all the viewers in the square that seems to happen to juventus fans . 
  but then again you got ta beg nato to send troops . 
  so let 's hope you 'll remain cheerful when you 'll ask the brits to kindly send some troops over . 
  you get russians in the east . 
   we 'll how much you support we in such moments when the russians rattle the cage, 
  i 've noticed that that live `` news '' is very rarely accurate,
