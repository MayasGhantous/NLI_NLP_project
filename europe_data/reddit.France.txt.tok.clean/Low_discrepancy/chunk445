  well because a rock falling on your head has no benefits . 
   no , seriously , how is deciding to work in a smoking pub different than deciding to smoke ? 
  you should read the purpose of labour laws . 
  you 're free to enter at your own risk in mines without a hard hat . 
  you ca n't do that as an employee . 
   workers ? 
  at bars ? 
  you choose which bar to work at . 
  again do you get that no matter who works there , a person ** will ** work there ? 
  and that person no matter what , will have a high probability to suffer ** for absolutely no ** benefit ? 
  you can smoke outdoors ca n't you ? 
  why are you submitting other people to suffering simply because `` they choose '' to ? 
  honestly the level of self centeredness of some people . 
   i understand the conversation . 
  well obviously you do n't since you compare second hand smoking with driving . 
   you said the workers do n't have a choice , but they do . 
  do you not understand that second hand smoking is dangerous and has no benefits ? 
  c'mon man it 's not hard to understand . 
  no matter what , you 'll still have to have bar workers . 
  so you 'll still have sick people . 
  ** for no fucking reason ** . 
  do you understand the conversation or do you not ? 
   if i 'm afraid of dying in a car accident an accident is a risk of driving for the benefit of getting to their destination . 
  what 's the benefit of them inhaling your smoke ? 
   get a job elsewhere then ? 
  go smoke outside . 
   then do n't refute or argue . 
  who made you king of reddit all of a sudden ? 
  usually these regulations are n't for patrons or owners but for workers . 
  they do n't really get a choice , do they ? 
   people have the right to question and complain if they feel the laws are being unjustly written . 
  valid complains are fine . 
  bitching about '' mercy of german companies '' is that nonsensical comments that you can not refute or argue . 
  it 's the difference between asking `` so what is the proof of evolution theory ? '', 
  and saying `` evolution is just a theory ! '', 
   on one hand , it should be the owner 's choice whether to allow smoking or not . 
  it 's his restaurant , his decision . 
  what if the owner decides to hire chinese and pay them 50 euros per month ? 
  his bar his decision ? 
  the people who work at the bar are also human beings and believe it or not , they also have health problems . 
  nice deflection . 
  i 'll stop commenting here because this is getting ridiculous . 
   but if you are employed by another company you must respect the minimum wage in the home country . 
  which is respected . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  if you work for more than 3 days in another country , you 're a posted worker and as such ** you get the minimum wage of that foreign/host country ** . 
  http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/posted-workers/index_en.htm  minimum rates of pay : your wage may not be less than the local minimum wage or the wage set by binding collective agreements in your sector of employment , if these are in force in the host country again , if you 're in country a , ** you must respect the laws of country a ** . 
   which is respected . 
  there was a loophole which is being closed down . 
  i do n't understand why you 're so vehement against this eu regulation when you do n't know existing eu regulation . 
   but this eu regulation is unfair . 
  if you work in country a , then you must respect the regulation and laws of country a. 
  and minumum wage is part of law . 
   are you out of your mind ? 
  i just think that in my country you respect my laws . 
  if that means i 'm crazy then so be it . 
  well in that case , they wo n't have to pay higher wages . 
   under the new rules , foreign drivers would be considered a `` posted worker '' - potentially meaning they would get at least the minimum wage of the country they were in - if they spent three days or more per month working away from home . 
  if your polish driver will transport stuff from spain to germany to uk , then he 'll have to a certain minimum wage of those countries . 
  if he transports stuff from poland to romania and to bulgaria . 
  he 'll be paid the minimum wage there . 
  if you work in country a you should respect the laws of country a. 
  and minimum wage is part of the law . 
   how is a polish truck company that is located in poland supposed to pay 2-3 times more money when they are based in a poorer country ? 
  they 're based in poorer countries but they 're transporting stuff in and for richer countries . 
  you work in france , you get paid french minimum wage . 
  doesnt that make sense for laws in france to apply to all people that are in france ? 
  if you come from a country where beating your wife for cheating is legal , does that mean you can beat your wife while you 're in france ? 
  this is eu regulation . 
  if eu regulation bothers you , you can go the way of the british . 
   stereotypes it 's a stereotype that communist industrialism was inefficient ? 
  that 's why poland and romania had to buy car r&d from the west and they made the same type of car for 30 years ? 
   so being at the mercy of german companies is a good thing now ? 
  if being in the eu bothers you so much , you are free to vote to leave . 
  no one is forced to remain ( see uk ) . 
  and with 2004 , poland was given new industrial jobs . 
  you have shitty jobs that made you die earlier , that made you live in poorer conditions etc. 
  since joining the eu , poland has become ** more industrialised ** is the purpose of the polish society to have industry jobs or is the purpose of the polish society to live better ? 
  you can put communism again and have 100 % industry jobs like [ these ones ] ( https://youtu.be/dfgs2y5wj14?t=15s ) . 
  that 's up to you . 
   but last time i checked communist style industrialisation was ** no longer sustainable ** . 
  people starting becoming more and more poor . 
   competition with western companies has led to a massive industrial decline in eastern europe . 
  i 'll write it in bold . 
  ** wth are you talking about ? 
   i have the impression that you are mistaken two concepts : industrialization and productivity . 
  it is not the same . 
  so industrial jobs went from ee to we ? 
  that 's bullshit and you know it very well . 
   watch your stuff mate . 
  especially in that garbage station in the heart of ethnic brussels , the poorest part of the city . 
  not many belgians around there . 
  i was walking by there at night a few years ago . 
  the police stopped in a van and picked us up to warn us that the region is dangerous . 
  after they dropped us at our place . 
  * 1 ) be white * 2 ) do n't be not white . 
  i continued to walk by there at night sometimes , did n't seem really dangerous . 
  heck the most dangerous thing there was dexia hq . 
  there are people that think that slovakia is not in fifa ? 
   but you can also take into account indicators like proportion of people employed in industry .
