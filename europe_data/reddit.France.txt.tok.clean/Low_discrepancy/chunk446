  in this criterion it was 5.2 million of poles in 1980 and 2.8 million in 2013 . 
  and per the comment of / u/thomanou https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6eexx8/eu_proposes_time_limits_on_cheaper_foreign/di9xeyg/ the manufacturing output went from 16bn to 94bn . 
  so ** half ** the number of workers produce ** 6 ** times more . 
  would you prefer returning to 1980 ? 
  i do n't understant your point . 
   so , imho we can call that process as ` decline ' . 
  some of researchers call that changes as ` deindustralisation ' of poland . 
  poland went from being the 31st manufacturer to the 19th . 
  tl ; dr we call all agree that your initial comment  competition with western companies has led to a massive industrial decline in eastern europe . 
  is bullshit . 
   competition with western companies has led to a massive industrial decline in eastern europe . 
  wth are you talking about dude ? 
  did you check any recent statistics ? 
  let 's check some on the two largest ee eu countries poland and romania . 
  ee national industry collapsed for one reason , fall of communism . 
  look at the [ co2 emissions per capita ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:nld&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:rom&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) they collapsed in 2 years from 88-90 . 
  lets look at some cars made by poland and romania before they joined the eu . 
  * from [ 1967-1993 , the polski fiat 125p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polski_fiat_125p ) . 
  * from [ 1973-2000 , the polski fiat 126p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_126#polski_fiat_126p ) ( in 93 , the reached 3m cars made ) * from [ 1968-1972 , the dacia 1100 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacia_1100 ) * from [ 1969-2000 , the dacia 1300 and variants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automobile_dacia ) . 
  2m cars . 
  you 'll realise that the polski fiat sounds really close to fiat , and the dacia 1100 looks really like a renault 8 and the dacia 1300 looks really like the [ renault 12 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/renault_12 ) . 
  i wonder why ? 
  looks like we r&d was sold in ee for a long time so they can build their own cars . 
  now come the years 2000 . 
  [ do you see yourself buying this car in 2003 ? ] ( http://auto-database.com/image/dacia-1410-seriess-20214.jpg ) . 
  let 's get real . 
  no one would . 
  so once more the local markets had to open . 
  and international manufacturers bought local companies . 
  dacia now can export the cars they make out of romania . 
  you can actually [ see yourself buying this car ] ( https://images.caradisiac.com/images/1/1/8/9/111189/s0-essai-video-dacia-sandero-stepway-restylee-nouvelle-recette-prix-inchange-391335.jpg ) . 
  let 's look at polish [ car production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automotive_industry_in_poland#cite_note-paiz-9 ) : * 2002 -  300k cars * 2009 -  900k cars . 
  poland produced ** 300 % ** more cars since joining the eu . 
  romanian [ car production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automotive_industry_in_romania ) : * 2000 -  78k cars * 2013 -  410k cars romania saw an increase of ** 500 % ** increase in car production . 
  in the period 1986-1992 , romania produced [ 6.5 k cars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automobile_dacia ) . 
  ** 560k ** cars . 
  eastern europe has become the factory of europe . 
  https://www.ft.com/content/44c031be-f967-11df-a4a5-00144feab49a claiming that ee had a massive decline in industry is ** ridiculous ** . 
  do n't get greedy . 
  i did n't even want it in the first place . 
  well [ david is 5m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_\\ ( michelangelo \\ ) ) and he was the little guy in the fight against goliath . 
   germany threatened them with economic ` sanctions ' . 
  dude , you should check what the president of france has said concerning that ( hint : he wants sanctions for those that refuse quotas ) . 
  you 'll realise that your views are actually a minority in france . 
   the eu is there to support the general cause of eu member states , not only germany 's . 
  you sound confused af . 
  it was france that wanted the euro , it was france that implemented the 3 % deficit rule etc etc. 
   for example with the refugee question , many east european states do not want economic migration from islamic countries nder the umbrella of refugee shelter . 
  what they are ** refugees ** . 
  they were granted asylum and as such they 're refugees . 
   i love the eu and support eu , but i am not an europhile . 
  clearly since you do n't mind italy and greece drowning out in refugees . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  while germany would have the bigger say ( because of course they would ) the wo n't `` decide for the rest of europe '' . 
  geesh man . 
   and the system would allow for some great mitm attacks to spy on citizens . 
  vpns and https are your friends, 
     this is also why i voted ` no ' , emotional blackmail by using a disaster is pathetic . 
  so you voted with your emotions because people used emotions ? 
  what 's the minimum voting age over there ? 
   it only had a view spelling mistakes top kek . 
  i remember magadan from watching ewan mcgregor do his bike tour around the world [ long way round ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_way_round ) . 
  it was a fantastic show , loved every bit of it . 
  i think i saw this office in one of the backroom casting vids . 
   that those guys should n't be stripped of there citizenship or else we 'll never be able to judge them . 
  just because someone is n't french does n't mean they can not be judged for their crimes . 
   to be declared traitor or accused of so one need to belong to the party being betraid . 
  and that was the case for people in ww1 and ww2 . 
  are you saying people who join isis gave up their french citizenship ? 
  they still use dip pens ? 
  well did n't take long until hitler . 
   well how can you judge someone for treason if you do n't consider him as a member of your nation ? 
  they 're french citizens , then they committed treason by joining the germans in ww1/2 or isis now . 
  it 's a simple cause and effect type of relationship that is n't hard to understand . 
   which is , quite clearly , not compatible with the geneva conventions , as killing pow 's is directly prohibited by article 2 . 
  well then you 're free to file a complaint to the competent authorities . 
   everyone is a soldier since when is everyone a soldier ? 
  civilians in iraq and syria are still civilians . 
   and if there is no rule of law , who could guarantee , that you are not the next target for something you are accused of having said or done ? 
  in a warzone , you are allowed to kill enemy soldiers . 
  how is that a surprise to you ? 
  under what shape or form is that against the law ? 
   this practice violates the universal human rights , the fundamental concept of rule of law and a due process you should check what war is dude . 
  wait ? 
  is that sarcasm ? 
  do they come back ? 
   it denies the states/society responsibility in what she created , rejecting the problem without solving it and therefore continuing production of it . 
  so if a person commits treason and joins the enemy , it is the fault of the country the person initially belonged to ? 
  that 's some veeeeeeerry sketchy logic you have there . 
  it 's not . 
  france never ratified this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_the_reduction_of_statelessness, 
   so restoration is kinda expected well the italians did n't when they had it ... 
  in some cases french govts did allow for the restoration and preservation of villas , see villa medici . 
   and poland and germany and italy and switzerland and france and spain and sweden and russia and . 
  so austerlitz ? 
   no it is very important because anti missile defenses exist . 
  that exists because the us reneged on the treaty it signed with russia therefore undermining the mad policy and starting a tiny a new tiny arms race . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-ballistic_missile_treaty the us knows how to protect its ass , meanwhile the nuclear war will be carried in europe . 
  awesome !, 
  yeah people like / u/sperrel should really be grateful that his country portugal was never conquered by muslims .
