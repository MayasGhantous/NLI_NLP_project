  scientific articles are already very very dry and quite standard english is being used . 
  a minimal understanding of the language is needed to read them . 
   yeah , then why are they studying at a university ? 
  doctors , engineers ? 
  do they do research ? 
  should sick people now have to speak english because their doctors were trained in english ? 
  obviously not and i bet med schools in the netherlands are in dutch . 
  i wonder how they do n't fail miserably despite the severe handicap of teaching in dutch . 
  even the vast majority of phd students do n't go into academia . 
  https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-many-phds-actually-get-to-become-college-professors/273434/  and in my experience , well over half of people in an msc programme , and almost 100 % of people in a phd programme considering that the completion rate for phds in the us is only 40-50 % , you should realise your personal experience does n't match the global reality . 
  https://hub.wiley.com/community/exchanges/discover/blog/2015/05/11/improving-phd-completion-rates-where-should-we-start  universities should only be for people being trained and prepared for academic research or other very high skill professions honestly dude you have a very reduced view of what a university is . 
  i do n't understand the question . 
  can you rephrase it ? 
  french is just an example . 
  the same applies to other languages that are smaller . 
  do you think the vast majority of classes in poland or romania are taught in english ? 
   my current lab for example has 4 dutch people and 14 foreigners . 
  and what do those foreign people do , when they send their kids to kindergarten ? 
  do their kids speak dutch while the parents speak english or native language ? 
  you can not be part of society if you do not learn the language . 
  and what better way to learn the language than at university ? 
   writing textbooks in dutch is financially not feasible . 
  well how do med schools do it in the netherlands , or engineering schools , or law schools ? 
  engineers will need to speak the local language because they build stuff for the local people . 
  i fully expect people who come to france , to study in french . 
  why would you train engineers , doctors , etc if you do n't do it in your native language ? 
  http://cphpost.dk/news/denmark/foreign-students-want-to-stay-but-report-difficulty-finding-work.html  the students in the study pointed to that fact , saying that it is very rare to find job openings posted in english . 
  some 59 percent said that they \u00c2 `` rarely\u00c2 '' or \u00c2 `` almost never\u00c2 '' saw job postings in english . 
  not surprisingly then , 78 percent of the respondents agreed that learning danish was necessary in order to find work in denmark . 
  indeed . 
  in france we also have a large enough pool to attact talent . 
  besides france we have quite a large pool in africa . 
  and also for certain fields in south america or russia . 
  the last brazilian fields medalist for example is also french . 
   us engaged in proxy wars against russia to the extent of sending troops multiple times through last century . 
  every time it did n't went far from main battle zone . 
  so you 're suggesting ukraine become the next koreas , vietnam or afghanistan ? 
  are you suuuure about that ? 
   some stay , some leave . 
  that 's how it is , nothing personal . 
  those that leave : * represent lost investment by tax payers * took the place of a student that probably wanted to stay . 
  actually retaining capable workforce is extremely important , if not you face a small brain drain ( besides the actual financial drain ) . 
  if foreign students were to study in danish , they 'd feel more closely connected to the country , have better chances to join the local job market . 
  it would be a win-win for everybody . 
   how exactly are you going to teach an advanced level course in dutch , when ( like i said ) there are no dutch textbooks or references to look at , no dutch research papers to read , etc. ? 
  ask us french how we do it . 
  the textbooks are in french . 
  actually doing research only comes up in your phd . 
  reading research papers comes up quite late too ( at least in mathematics ) . 
   you mean two people having a chat in their first languages ? 
  sure . 
  the vast amount of research done is between people living in the same country . 
  so yeah ... research is done in the local language . 
   writing grants , preparing and giving presentations ? 
  you do realise that all grants are not just european right ? 
  and for every 1 presentation done abroad , you do several in your home country . 
  it 's quite common to have the slides in english and the talk being in french . 
  many researchers are moving around to a new university every 2-3 years . 
  now i know you 're fully clueless how research is done . 
  the holy grail in research is ** tenure ** . 
  honestly dude wtf are you talking about ? 
   anyway , scientists and researchers are rarely fully integrated in society even if they were born there . 
  * facepalm * mkay dude . 
  besides the fact that the ** vast majority ** of uni students ** will never do research ** so they 'll have to seek out the local job market , you have very quirky views about what research and scientists are . 
  i 'll stop here because it 's getting ridiculous . 
   what is the problem exactly ? 
  weird that you as a danish can not see the problem . 
  http://cphpost.dk/news/denmark/foreign-students-want-to-stay-but-report-difficulty-finding-work.html you have foreign students that study in english , do n't bother to learn danish and when they finish studies , they simply leave because ... well jobs are in danish ... 
   any university that tries to operate a research department not in english will fall behind . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  this is about classes not research departments . 
  and research departments in their day to day workings , perform in the language of the country they are located in . 
  you can be a very successful research even if you studied in a language other than english . 
  and for foreign people studying in a country where classes are in english , they 'll have very little desire to actually learn the local language meaning they wo n't be fully integrated in society . 
  yeah . 
  do you know the difference between a baby and a foetus ? 
   everyone is supporting the two state solution and yet , nothing happened in xyz years . 
  everybody is supporting that crimea should go back russia yet nothing has happened in xyz years.that should tell us what ? 
   if we will support the two state , we will weaken the israel , which will most likely be attacked by its neighbours and destroyed you should call all the major european leaders because apparently they 're not following your advice as they 're supporting a two state solution . 
   i have no idea why any country would willingly join the eu at this point . 
  because getting visas to enter the eu is a bitch ? 
  because getting sent back home after finishing your studies because you have no work visa is a bitch ? 
  and a ton of other because . 
  it 's nice to sit on our golden western european thrown and say ... why would anyone want to sit on this golden pedestal ? 
  it 's so shiny and bright ... 
   1/3rd of babies born in france are muslim and that number rises every year . 
  this is going to lead to truly spectacular problems that the eu is simply not prepared for . 
  did / u/kulaks _ deserved_it say that ? 
  must be brain raspies . 
   what 's with forcing people to squat ? 
  it 's eastern europe . 
  everybody squats . 
   through so they knock on your doorstep . 
  let it be , we have nukes . 
  looks like the priest is held at gun point . 
  all of a sudden he 'll turn around and use the cross as a batman throwing cutter and take out the guard . 
   i am saying is people should be free to chose when 's the last time netflix picked up a show because you wrote them a letter or a nice big cheque ? 
  seems to me you consume what netflix gives you . 
  well netflix will have to add some variety to it . 
  you 'll get to discover new cultures man , stop being so sad about it .
