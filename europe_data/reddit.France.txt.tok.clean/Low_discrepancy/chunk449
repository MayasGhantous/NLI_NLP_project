   it 's unfair of you to ridicule them for that . 
  that avengers n. 38 is n't art ? 
  dude you 're a sensitive soul are n't you . 
  : s i hope you did n't cry too much ;, 
   you 're the king of deciding what people should and should n't like so you tell me . 
  and they wo n't get their avengers nb 25 ? 
  are you suuuuure about that ? 
  you sound a bit too melodramatic , do n't you think ? 
  did you compare bowling with the opera ? 
  are you ok man ? 
  soldiers wo n't make a huge difference , but they do create the symbol of the state . 
  a lot of terrorists ** do ** see it as a war . 
  they see themselves as soldiers . 
  and they seem to choose to fight the soldiers of the other side . 
  we 've had a few attacks on soldiers and policemen . 
  it 's kinda sad , but they seem to attract the crazies . 
  at least they 're better prepared than the random civilian to withstand attacks . 
   but i do n't need the state to tell me what art is is worthwhile . 
  guess what ? 
  the state does n't say what art is worthwhile . 
  the state simply says you have to invest a part locally . 
   for some people the avengers is their art and you do n't deserve to judge them because if that . 
  myes . 
  of course it is . 
  it is in fact the most successful art !, 
  because it has the highest box office . 
  that 's how it works right ? 
  that 's what you 're saying . 
  that the market makes the best choices on what art should be . 
  or do you think that the best art is avengers n. 47 ? 
  because that 's what brings the best box office . 
   my netflix subscription being used to fund greece 's ( other counties in favour of this ) film industry just because they can not produce content good enough for netflix to buy anyway . 
  you get to discover other cultures that you 'd not normally have a chance to discover . 
  you get to see other types of cinemas than typical american ones . 
   tyranny of the majority stops my goal being achieved but my position does not stop your goal being achieved . 
  what is your goal other than complaining ? 
   if you like european support it with your euros rather than the force of law . 
  vote it so . 
  if you dislike eu regulation , vote it next time to not have it . 
  if you disagree with this , you 're free to vote against it at the next elections you have , 
   not wanting to accept muslim immigrants do you understand the difference between ** immigrants ** and ** refugees ** ? 
  you do n't have any conclusions because you offer very little facts , only impressions , feelings . 
   it 's pretty obvious he was talking about his city , not the united states ... stick to not reading correctly dude ... where do you think the majority of muslims live in europe ? 
  http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2010/08/10/america-s-muslim-capitals seems like washington dc has the highest share , with 2 % of the population muslim . 
  compare that to european cities : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_the_european_union_by_muslim_population * paris 10-15 % * amsterdam 14 % * marseille 20-25 % stick to not checking the stats though . 
   the discussion is letting in people who do not even live in that particular country yet the guy that committed this attack was born in uk . 
  the vast amount of terrorists were born in the west or lived here for the majority of their life . 
  of course they 're not the same . 
  that 's why we 're bombing one and not the other . 
  but we 're not new to terrorism in europe . 
  yup . 
  but people on / r/europe know something police working on the case dont, 
  dude ... stick to funny trolling . 
   we have a large muslim community . 
  no you do n't . 
  the muslim community is some 3.3 million people . 
  that 's 1 % . 
  france alone has at least 4 million muslims ( or some 7-8 % of the population ) . 
  add to that the 4 million in germany , 2 million in uk . 
   the big difference , at least based on what i read on / r/europe , is that we do n't have sunni radicals running mosques where they try to radicalize young people , at least not that i 've ever heard of . 
  probably best not to start simplifications . 
  why would i be any different ? 
  having an opinion is perfectly fine . 
  acting like you 're the friggin absolute dictator ruler king of your country is ridiculous . 
  people here are just schmucks with a keyboard ;, 
  yeah you 'll continue to be frustrated man . 
  itt : people that think they have any decision power . 
   but it is not 100 % untouched . 
  show me on this bonsai tree where you touched it . 
   logging of infested spruces does not stop a bark beetle outbreak i 'm sorry but if you cut down all the trees , then you wo n't have any more tree diseases . 
  that 's simple facts . 
  that did n't stop many people , but they still get sent back to their country . 
   they would simply move to germany within a few weeks . 
  the do n't have the right to cross borders . 
  also they would not get any benefits in germany . 
   do you honestly think that `` more cooperation '' would have lead to considerably better performances in these investigations ? 
  yes . 
  abdeslam was identified at the border when he crossed from france to belgium . 
  but because the french border controls had no information on his , because belgium did n't pass them on , then he was let go . 
   i mean this is easier said than done . 
  there is n't a magic `` more cooperation '' strategy that you can employ and suddenly prevent any and every crime . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  what are you proposing ? 
  to sit on our asses and watch the world go by because * it 's too hard guuuuuuuys * . 
   so the left fucked up and now i as a conservative have to behave like i welcome refugees like they do so it does n't get worse ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_chancellors_of_germany the majority of german chancellors since ww2 have been conservative . 
  they ruled for 47 years while the left has ruled for 20 . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
   but part of the blame is on people like merkel that are allowing millions of people unchecked into europe . 
  so the manchester terrorist was a refugee that went through germany ? 
  what specifics do you want ? 
  germany will continue to collaborate with uk in security issues despite brexit . 
  what exactly do you expect ? 
  / r/europe got ta / r/europe . 
   china is extremely competent and capable . 
  chine is extremely large . 
  china is extremely ambitious . 
  china . 
   hell , those who took spanish even traveled to barcelona and visited the camp nou . 
  somewhere in the world there is surely at least one very angry catalan reading this phrase,
