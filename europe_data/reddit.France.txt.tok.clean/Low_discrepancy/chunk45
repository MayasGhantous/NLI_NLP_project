  this seems very costly after one or two messages . 
   i was still being downvoted to hell reddit.com has done you wrong . 
  : / let us all apologise for our behaviour . 
  reuters article said was there . 
  show me proof the recordings were fake . 
  yours too : /, 
  google plus pluses . 
  yt views . 
  360 no scope kill . 
  god man how can you be such a noob . 
  you 're russian . 
  blasik was in the cockpit 15 seconds before the air crash and during the landing phase . 
  in a particularly difficult moment in general but also now since the fog . 
  wtf was he doing there ? 
  he is not a member of the crew , he should have hauled his ass in his seat and buckle up . 
  honestly , did you ever board a plane ? 
  let 's take a random person who had family die in ankara bombing . 
  and let 's tell that person that we 've made a hashtag . 
  oh would n't that person feel so much better ? 
  now take a random turk not connected to the bombings , like you . 
  do you honestly deep down believe that a hashtag would make it all better ? 
  if you do , you 're completely friggin mistaken . 
  it does n't mean squat . 
  changing you fb photo does n't mean shit to any random person . 
  what the french wanted after the terrorist attack is to not have any more . 
  hashtag or fb photo , you can keep i do n't care and ** no sane person should care about social friggin media . 
  ** honestly , you people should work to not have terrorist attacks . 
  that 's the main point of it all . 
  do you think saying `` je suis x '' actually means anything ? 
  stop getting your panties in a knot . 
  it 's been a year plus . 
  honestly some people are such thin skinned . 
  they just look for ways to complain about `` being wronged '' in some way . 
  dude . 
  do you think a hashtag and changing you fb post actually helps anyone ? 
  i 'm confused by this behaviour . 
  the family of the victims would n't give 0 shits . 
  and for a normal french like me : who gives a crap ? 
  that has 0 value . 
  having someone that is not a member of the crew in the cockpit during one of the most delicate periods in a flight , during a special flight when conditions are quite bad , that 's friggin moronic . 
  take a goddamn seat and stop acting like god on earth . 
  why would people mess with their pilots like that ? 
   `` investigators revealed last week that poland 's air force chief , gen andrzej blasik , was one of two non-crew members in the cockpit of the plane before it crashed . 
  they said there was no evidence that gen blasik had pressured the pilots to land in bad weather . 
  i do n't know if you 've ever taken a plane before but you know what you do before landing ? 
  you sit the hell down in your designated seat . 
  you do n't start visiting the cockpit . 
  landing is one of the lost dangerous procedures . 
   but i would not be surprised if this was actually an orchestrated assassination of polish elites . 
  yeah sure . 
  the illuminati . 
  http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskbn0my0uz20150407  the radio station said the head of diplomatic protocol in the polish foreign ministry told the captain : ** `` we will try until we make it '' roughly 15 minutes before the crash . 
  **  ** polish air force commander-in-chief andrzej blasik , travelling on the plane as a passenger , was in the cockpit and told the pilots 41 seconds before the crash : `` you 'll make it easily , '' according to the transcript . 
  ** what 's the commander in chief doing in the cockpit 41 seconds before the crash ? 
  did they magically plant trees over the night ? 
  the pilots were pressured to land by the chief of staff . 
  it 's a n all around fuck up from the polish and the russians for not tending correctly to forest incoming . 
   did n't want me feeling cold [ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/nmmjr/iama_man_who_had_a_sexual_relationship_with_his/ ), 
   it is unworthy to let greece fall . 
  unless we 're talking about the greek economy , then those feta munchers can go screw themselves . 
  maybe because it 's kinda true http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-scientific-reason-cold-weather-could-cause-colds-180953817/?no-ist, 
  women in the workforce stats are 51 % in france vs 54 % in germany . 
  i doubt it 's only that . 
  had he inserted a comment about god it would have been perfect . 
  that 's not french . 
  french would be eee . 
  triple e sounds better than use . 
  they read their minds . 
  or made a poll . 
  whichever you think is more believable . 
  you 're drifting appart :'( . 
  we needed 2 ww to start birthing again . 
  interesting . 
  and germany was killing it before ww1, 
  uk just got in big trouble . 
  they just pissed off a nobel peace prize and leader of the free world . 
  i would n't want to be in their shoes . 
  :( we just take take take and give nothing back . 
  i really am a yeltsinist . 
  well in france 50 % of the police voted fn . 
  so unless they wan na ring him up and invite him for a beer , neah nothing will happen . 
   `` religion growing the fastest '' atheism is n't a religion . 
  what if you believe in a drunkard being the russian president ? 
  no no . 
  must be at the cost of eu membership . 
  article from 2014 . 
  put a flair on this article . 
  :d i hope you have good friends that set you up then . 
  it was about a ww . 
  this is kiiinda different than a referendum . 
  no one will freak out if the head of state says anything . 
  yeah . 
  a nazi . 
  i doubt any new head of state that positions themselves in this referendum will not cause a crisis . 
  such a convention could be broken by a different head of state . 
  convention is n't obligation . 
  unless my english is way way off . 
  is it really an obligation or just habit ? 
  it 's not like there 's some law that says : yeah in case of a referendum to leave the eu the queen must pipe it down . 
  i love how obama is more involved in this than your queen .
