   it is regrettable that few french are fluent in german . 
  it is also regrettable that so few germans are fluent in french . 
  yet such is life . 
   considering that germany is france 's mot important partner , yes but spanish is much closer to french and in terms of number of speakers they 're not even close .

   how can a modern civilization have one birthplace because modern civilization is but there is a birthplace for modern civilization . 
  it happened in belo horizonte , brazil . 
  and the date was the 8th of june 2014 . 
   what would be enough ? 
  calm down buddy , calm down . 
  need i remind you that germany had a terrorist attack and the perp crossed ** 3 ** countries ? 
  or that france had a terrorist attack planned in belgium and the perp escaped there and was not found for months ? 
  current cooperation is not enough . 
  whatever your fantasy is man . 
   because terrorists are rarely just insane if even at all . 
   well , it would make you a bigot , a racist and a nazi , in the present narrative . 
  oh stop the pathetic victimizing . 
  the vast vast majority of terrorists have been western citizens . 
   it 's always a lone attacker , but then in the days and weeks after the attack , dozens of others are arrested in relation to it . 
  like in the last terrorist attack they arrested 12 people .

   the police in europe is forced to do racial profiling , not because they 're racist , it 's simply a reality of living with gypsies in your city . 
  how exactly do you profile gypsies ? 
  this guy [ has gypsy roots ] ( https://www.bzi.ro/public/upload/photos/76/stefan_banica_jr.jpg ) . 
  this guy is [ full on gypsy ] ( http://arhiva.festivalenescu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/madalin-voicu.jpg ) . 
  how do you `` detect '' gypsies ? 
  dude it 's no mistery that criminality benefits from being able to cross easily borders while police etc can not . 
  we need an eu wide police force and intelligence force . 
  i got burglered . 
  neah your comment is dumb . 
  i just go for low hanging fruit : / . 
  lazy i know . 
  how do you define `` thought to be linked '' ? 
  do n't you have a justice system in romania ? 
  and where do you deport your own citizens to ? 
  you did n't answer my questions . 
  how do you `` deal '' with this problem ? 
  so you 'll vote for someone that actually wants to stop selling arms to saudis ? 
  or someone like trump that tells us in fucking saudi arabia that iran is actually the terrorist financer ? 
   i 'm sorry , but wanting someone to deal with this huge problem is n't nazist how do you `` deal '' with this problem buckaroo ? 
  no no no . 
  trump said the global terrorist financer is iran !, 
   to be fair , there are very real practical limits to a government 's power . 
  you can only crack down on people 's civil liberties so much before you start being the cause of their radicalization . 
  and that 's why there is no instant `` solving '' of this problem we 're facing . 
   there were also a certain number of soldiers amongst the refugees . 
  in accordance with international law , the austrian ministry of defence decided to open four internment camps for all refugees carrying weapons and those clearly recognizable as military personnel . 
  by december 1956 more than a 1,000 people were held in the largest internment camp in salzburg , wals-siezenheim . 
  the interned refugees were practically prisoners ; they could not move about freely , and their chances of being accepted by other countries were slim . 
  only 1000 soldiers were held in closed camps . 
   after being in closed camps source ? 
   they did not riot http://www.iwm.at/publications/5-junior-visiting-fellows-conferences/vol-xxv/deconstruction-of-a-myth/  despite all these efforts , doctors detected a `` camp psychosis '' among the refugees , which manifested itself in passivity , depression , and latent aggressiveness . 
  [ 17 ] these symptoms were especially noticeable in the internment camp in salzburg , from whence many of the internees tried to flee in order to sneak into a `` normal '' camp . 
  in mid-november 1956 around 100 internees held a hunger strike to protest against the way they were treated , and later that month disturbances there required police intervention to restore order . 
  [ 18 ] in mid-december 1956 the director of security in burgenland reported that the formerly thankful hungarians had become more and more dissatisfied and impatient . 
  in addition , they demanded expensive drugs and were not happy with the medical care . 
  [ 19 ] austrian officials were of course less than pleased by these complaints . 
  a document from the ministry of foreign affairs noted that the camps were suitably equipped , and more comforts and conveniences would only induce the refugees to stay in austria . 
  [ 20 ] in january 1957 interior minister helmer was forced to make a public declaration that refugees also had duties and criticised those who caused trouble . 
  [ 21 ] seems to me like they did bitch . 
  fuck , the police had to intervene . 
  why would the complain so much ? 
  would they have preferred to be sent back to hungary ? 
  http://time.com/4538652/hungary-refugee-crisis-history/  austria , which received 90 % of the refugees , was still recovering from the devastation of world war ii . 
  like most european countries at the time , it was ill-prepared for the sudden influx , but despite the scale of the humanitarian crisis on its doorstep , austria provided shelter , clothes and food for all who arrived . 
  ** children were given care and access to education . 
  ** & nbsp ;  states joined forces , and over the next year , almost 40 countries came together to help care for the refugees who had arrived in austria and yugoslavia . 
   in europe , most of the hungarian refugees were resettled to the u.k. , france , germany , sweden or switzerland , where the vast majority were later granted citizenship . 
  others were resettled further afield to australia , canada or , like kepecz-hays and her family , to america . 
  looks like the hungarian refugees did get redistributed . 
   the refugee crisis was caused and is still being caused by lax asylum rules . 
  i 'm sure hungary hated those lax laws in 1956 . 
   but you people are incapable of self-criticism . 
  bashing eastern europeans for your failures is much easier . 
  * facepalm * . 
  sure dude . 
  sure . 
   maybe he did n't anticipate that certain countries would openly invite such insane amounts of migrants , who would , of course , tramp right through our country . 
  uhm . 
  you should check your dates . 
  the refugee crisis was in full swing by the time merkel said that germany will accept them . 
   they are bunch of money hungry morons with no knowledge about economy or idea how to rule . 
  huh ? 
  what 's that ? 
   between 5 % and 8 % of uk businesses export to the eu what a pointless statistic . 
  awesome . 
  what percentage of uk business are finance related for example ? 
  would be a very small percentage . 
  does that mean finance does n't matter for uk ? 
  / r/france is actually a great little sub . 
  the moderation is fantastic . 
  it got a bit too politicalduring the election but that 's understandable . 
  finally , important news, 
  yeah . 
  those ~ ~ 37 ~ ~ 1037 votes will propell them to being the top party . 
   luckily i was in front of a vegetable shop mum 's a huge fan of eggplants . 
  you should return it , 
  they wo n't eat you , you know . 
   i support same sex relationships , not my business what 2 woman or man does with eachother , but pls dont call it marriage .
