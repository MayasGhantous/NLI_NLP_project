  ok . then give them the right to adopt or medically assisted procreation like you give other couples . 
  * facepalm * . 
  people do n't really understand what gay marriage is about . 
  it 's not about a friggin name not is it about `` you do whatever you want '' , it 's about ** rights ** . 
  rights for gay couples to adopt for example . 
  rights to medically assisted procreation that heterosexual couples benefit from . 
   the graph you respond to is extrapolating from 15 years of past data no it 's not . 
  it does n't use a regression line or anything . 
   would like to czech it out . 
  czech mate . 
  [ do it ! ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38654176 ) . 
  it 's not like refugees ca n't take boats . 
   i forsee us disentangling defence and intelligence too . 
  i forsee the opening of calais !, 
   he 's talking long term , which he is correct on . 
  that 's some high quality extrapolation . 
  do you not agree that the airplanes were american ? 
  i see we 're discovering now the french legislative elections . 
  it should be full proportional we should have that ... sadly we do n't have mature politicians . 
  macron who was heavily supported by ps now has named a pm from ump . 
  the govt is with people from ps , center and ump . 
  what does ump do when its party members get called in the govt ? 
  * they friggin remove them from the party . 
  * they have no desire to collaborate , to participate in the democratic process . 
  that 's utterly shameful and shows they put party before country . 
  maybe it 's much easier to see when others fault you than when you fault others . 
   romania has gone from a budget surplus to a projected deficit of -3 % in less than a year you should check your numbers https://www.agerpres.ro/english/2017/04/24/romania-has-3-pct-of-gdp-budget-deficit-in-2016-eurostat-preliminary-data--15-21-54 in 2016 romania had a budget ** deficit ** of 3 % . 
  no , it was n't psd that ruined everything in one month . 
  it was the previous right wing pro business govt that * reduced * the vat tax meaning less money to the budget . 
  i wo n't read the rest of your comment since it starts with a falsehood . 
  once you correct that and restate what you have to restate , we 'll continue talking . 
  neah . 
  i 'd be quite happy if poland leaves . 
   until you realize the massive wage hikes come from inflating our public debt and deficit balance . 
  you do realise that wages are paid mostly by the private sector right ? 
  and i 'm willing to bet that it 's almost exclusively the private sector that pays minimum wage . 
  i never said that the soviets did n't commit genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity . 
  of course they did . 
  i simply believe the nazis were worse . 
  i also find it interesting why many ee love to claim that the soviets were just as bad , if not worse , than the nazis . 
   at nazi camps , people at least got a roof over their heads . 
  / r/srs, 
   are the ones causing problems that 's not an actual difference . 
  romanians were and are being expulsed out of france if they have no means to live here or proof they 've entered schengen in under 3 months . 
  see ... that 's a thing . 
  you , i , anyone here , have no means to detect a romanian gypsy . 
  and we 're not expulsing them because they 're gypsies . 
   arguably living through gulag was worse than living through nazi equivalent . 
  kinda evens out okay . 
  gim me the numbers of lithuanians killed by nazis in gulags etc etc then . 
  what 's the difference between a gypsy romanian citizen and a non gypsy romanian citizen ? 
  do they have different passports ? 
  i 'm saying that if a lithuanian got sent to the gulag and then was set free , and many , many were , then it 's not the same as someone dying during the holocaust . 
  you know ... because that lithuanian did n't get killed . 
  that does n't stop romanians from coming to france even though they have no means to live here and therefore have no right to live here . 
  we send them back . 
   does n't count as a crime against humanity comparable to holocaust , neah . 
  being sent to a gulag and being set free after a couple of years does n't count as the holocaust . 
  that should n't come as a surprise . 
   they do n't care that they do n't have the right to do that . 
  well germany will send them back . 
  we do that with romanians in france . 
   no , enforcing quotas , enforcing anything is a problem . 
  so france should give to the eu budget as much or as little as it desires then . 
  why should we enforce any sum to be given . 
  to each their own amirite ? 
  why should the eu enforce the fact that polish are allowed to move freely in the eu . 
  france has high unemployment , then the polish should leave france . 
  to each country to accept as many foreigners as they can . 
   i 'm fine with any commonly agreed solution , not to go `` do it or face sanctions '' - that 's just being tyrannical and not what europe is about . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
   each according to their own or by any other means , not enforcing quotas . 
  did you miss the fact that the eu was going through a refugee crisis ? 
  greece , italy did n't get to choose what to accept . 
  germany and sweden helped out . 
  poland should get off its ass and start acting like it 's in a union . 
   the number is n't the problem , the precedent is . 
  what precedent might that be ? 
  acting to solve the new problems and issues the eu is facing in a cohesive manner ? 
  omg that is awful indeed !, 
   but i imagine something else can be done . 
  we 'll have a multi-speed eu . 
   ohh , so leaving people to starve in siberia and putting them in concentration camps to , again , starve an be worked to death , does n't count as killing ? 
  if they were starved or worked to death yes that counts as killing . 
  so give us the numbers of those lithuanians that were killed in camps and gulags . 
   the people hate their leaders https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_hungary#latest_general_elections his party got 44 % at the last egeneral election ... which is huge . 
  does it matter ? 
   it 's blatantly clear that any migrants who are brought to eeurope will simply move to the west . 
  they normally do n't have the right to do that though ... 
   which is absurd considering the number of romanians is firstly 10 times smaller than the poles where did you get your numbers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_the_united_kingdom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_the_united_kingdom * 220k romanians in uk . 
  * 830k polish in uk . 
   they are only the 11th minority or such http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-an-overview/ it was actually 5th/6th . 
   but not being bullied into accepting people that do n't want to live here is not one of those things . 
  it 's about unloading many of the refugees germany is having . 
  abotu sharing the load and the difficulties one country is facing . 
  it 's not exactly rocket science . 
  polish immigration is not my problem . 
  it 's just more and more obvious that poland is not a trustworthy partner in the eu . 
  the day poland become a net contributor to the eu is the day poland does a polout,
