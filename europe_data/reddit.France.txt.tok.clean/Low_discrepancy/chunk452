   he needs to show that we profit from his plans as well . 
  the president of france is n't some door to door salesman . 
  it is not the job of the french president to convince germans of jackshit . 
  germans do n't elect him , french do . 
  it is up to your german leaders to convince you that the current situation in the eu is untenable . 
  and we french are starting to get fed up : * 2007 elections : 1st place euphile , 2nd place euphile , 3rd place euphile 4th place euphobe * 2012 elections : 1st place euphile , 2nd place euphile , 3rd place euphobe , 4th place euphobe * 2017 elections : 1st place euphile , 2nd place euphobe , 3rd place euphile , 4th place euphobe . 
  do you see a pattern here ? 
  because i 'm deffo seeing a pattern here . 
   i doubt so . 
  you 're talking about cap . 
  well france can leave the eu and dedicate that money from the cap to agriculture directly , and it 'll still be fine . 
   i might even say common knowledge here that france is very adamant in enforcing its economic interests on the european stage . 
  unlike any other eu country ? 
   the most widely known example is the eu 's agrarian policy for example , which france is profiting from a lot . 
  dude , we can leave the eu and still be fine . 
  again we contribute more than we get . 
  again , romania became a dictatorship in february 1938 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_constitutional_referendum,_1938  nazi germany started annexing its neighbors anchluss and sudeten march 1938 . 
  feb 1938 < march 1938 . 
   soviet union invaded finland . 
  that happened in 1939 . 
   that is why even nowadays the presidents of many countries have a special right in case of war to request almost absolute power . 
  ( like romania and france ) myes . 
  political parties in france have been banned . 
   ) ) )  no way to know if the ww2 scenario was not happening if romania would have stayed a democracy or not , historical tradition says it would have , but sadly we can not change the past so it is impossible to know . 
  * facepalm * . 
  dude stop . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  carol had been undermining romanian democracy for the whole of his reign . 
  ** he transformed romania into a dictatorship ** waaaay before any ww2 crap . 
  he started his own personality cult . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carol_ii_of_romania#reign_to_1938 i 'm done here . 
  the level of backpedalling is ridiculous . 
   is n't that a major point of contention in france right now ? 
  it 's a single market . 
   the political scenario of ww2 and our positioning as a state maybe ww2 started in 1939 . 
   ultimatum on bassarabia ? 
  that happened in 1940 . 
  that happened in 1940 . 
   did those hasten the dictatorship or were they also inconsequential ? 
  well they did hasten ... if carol ii was a time traveller . 
   these should be made in germany , certainly not in elsewhere the eu . 
  we do n't owe investments to eu countries , rather we owe them to our own population . 
  of course . 
  investments made in germany . 
  and when the german govt will start the bidding process guess what , ** every eu company ** will be allowed to apply . 
  i wan na see them german construction companies that hire german compete with polish construction companies that hire polish . 
   this will not just be another way to gift german tax money to france but serve an intelligible purpose that germans profit from as well . 
  i must be reading the wrong numbers . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/europe/09/eu_budget_spending/img/graph_total_payments_466x485.gif looks to me that both france and germany are ** net ** contributors to the eu budget . 
  what money are we actually getting from you guys ? 
   international commission for the evaluation of the crimes of the nazi and soviet occupation regimes in lithuania lets go to the source cited : http://www.communistcrimes.org/en/database/lithuania/historical-introduction  lithuania has a glorious history and was among the largest european states in the middle ages , but was later conquered by its neighbors and disappeared from the world map . 
  lithuanians restored their national sovereignty in 1989 and started building an independent state . 
  in 1939 , lithuania fell victim to the molotov-ribbentrop pact between soviet russia and nazi germany , leading to occupation and its incorporation into the soviet union in 1940 . 
  the communist occupation launched brutal measures to destroy civil society , civil liberties , the habitual way of life and economic order . 
  the powerful catholic church was put under heavy pressure . 
  during the first year of occupation , communist authorities arrested thousands of lithuanians and arbitrarily executed hundreds of political prisoners . 
  some 17.730 persons were deported to siberia in june 1941 . 
  during 1941-44 , lithuania was occupied by nazi germany , who initiated another wave of terror . 
  the red amy returned in 1944 and lithuania fell back under soviet occupation . 
  to suppress the lithuanian armed resistance , communist forces murdered thousands of resistance fighters and civilians accused of aiding them . 
  as many as 300.000 were deported or sentenced to prison camps on political grounds . 
  lithuania lost 780.000 citizens as a result of communist occupation , including 21.556 killed in the partisan war and 275.697 deported or sentenced to gulag ; about 25.000 died in wwii battles and 440.000 sought refuge abroad to escape communist persecution . 
  lithuania officially restored its independence in 1990 , but suffered another attack in 1991 when the soviet army killed 13 demonstrators in vilnius . 
  although lithuania was able restore its independence , the wounds of occupation have yet to heal . 
  just because you lost citizens , does n't mean they were killed . 
  the vast majority were deported , some were allowed to come back , others were not . 
  others left lithuania to the west . 
   since it seems i have to remind you that romania before ww2 and the soviet ultimatum was still a democratic country , * facepalm * . 
  do i have to teach you your own history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_constitution_of_romania in 1938 , romania had a coup and it became essentially a dictatorship under carol ii . 
  romania did away with separation of powers . 
  there was ** only one legal political party ** , the national renaissance front . 
  how can a country with one allowed party be called a democracy ? 
   i said in a completely opposite direction , you remind me of a romanian politician , god you are so biased . 
  i put you in front of your own contradictions . 
  romania killed its own citizens . 
  and for a very long period , romania did not recognize it . 
  again there is no holocaust museum where some of the worst progroms happened . 
   i do not understand what is so weird about my pov , where did i say the romanian jews were not romanians or that i do not consider what happened to them horrible ? 
  right here :  but you pretty much prove the point that romanians and many easterners are completely right to consider the soviets worse you assume that for romanian jews , the soviets are worse than the nazis . 
   lso consider that under the communist not only romanians but ethnic gypsies , magyars , germans suffered as well , actually maybe worse than romanian ethnics , but again , that is deviating from the main topic at hand . 
  i you are confusing communism with the soviet occupation . 
  again you show extreme lack of knowledge of your own history . 
  quite regretable . 
  as some from france i hope that the polish govt also stays strong . 
  they 'll only become more isolated in the eu . 
  i want verifiable sources from historians . 
  not a png . 
   lithuanians deported to siberia under soviet occupation : 130,000 your source :  some 60,000 managed to return to lithuania , while 30,000 were prohibited from settling back in their homeland . 
  & nbsp ;  approximately 28,000 of lithuanian deportees died in exile due to poor living conditions . 
   lithuanian political prisoners and partisans deported to gulags : 150,000 it gives the same link as the previous one . 
   fuck you calm down and give proper numbers ** of people killed ** . 
  because nazis and lithuanians killed more jews than soviets killed lithuanians . 
  that seems to become a simple fact . 
   i assure you if you place romania and moldova together , the soviets killed more romanians than the nazis did jews over their rule ( mainly because the soviet rule was much longer , but still ) . 
  well no need to assure me . 
  let 's see the maths . 
  the occupation of romania was between 1944-1958 . 
   but you pretty much prove the point that romanians and many easterners are completely right to consider the soviets worse so the ** 300000 romanian jewish ** killed during the holocaust in romania were not romanian ? 
  very interesting pov .
