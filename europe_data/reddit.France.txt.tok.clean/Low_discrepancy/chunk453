   but what percentage of lithuanians did they kill ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes#lithuania even in absolute numbers , they do n't come really close to the number of jewish killed in lithuania . 
   they surpassed it . 
  just not on jews , but lithuanians . 
  besides use numbers show me the numbers then . 
  you 're lithuanian . 
   soviet union repressed my family , nazi germany did not . 
  sorry , but personally for my family soviet union was worse . 
  by that logic the nazis were great for germans and not so great for others . 
  you should ask a german what he thinks about your theory . 
  history is not the experiences of one individual . 
   i agree that they are both evil no , you are claiming that both are ** equally evil ** . 
  which is flat out wrong and unhistorical . 
   the article starts with `` the baltic ultranationalists rewriting east european history as an equal nazi-soviet ` double genocide ' must be stopped '' . 
  somehow it feels like reading some russian propaganda . 
  well let 's look at the percentages then . 
  nazis and locals in lithuania killed 95 % of jewish . 
  what percentage of people did the soviets kill ? 
   soviet union was an enemy of estonia but that does ** not mean ** that the soviet union was ** equal ** to nazi germany . 
  it 's not russian propaganda to state this obvious fact . 
   why ca n't we just say that both nazis and soviets are evil ? 
  why do we have to love soviets because they killed less people in some other country ? 
  well again that 's explained in the video . 
   you sent me some low quality video with unknown people talking in an empty room , how does it prove anything ? 
  it 's the same guy that wrote this article . 
  enjoy . 
  it simply changed nazi occupation with bolshevik occupation and continued the crimes against the people from these countries . 
  comparing nazi occupation with soviet occupation is a spat on the face of the holocaust . 
  95 % of jewish were killed in lithuania . 
  did the soviets even come close to such numbers over there ? 
  the theories that nazis are just as worse as the soviets simply do n't hold any water . 
  take romania now for example . 
  50 % of jewish were exterminated . 
  were 50 % of romanians exterminated by the nazis ? 
  on 29th of june 1941 , romanian authorities , romanian police and romania army gathered up and killed 13266 jewish people in iasi . 
  when was the first memorial put in place ? 
  of course romanians will think that soviets were just as worse as nazis . 
  from one side they constantly get all the info on the crimes committed by the soviets , from the other side ... a city where 13200 jews were murdered did n't have any memorial and * still * does n't have a holocaust museum . 
  to see pictures of those killed , to see what happened etc. 
  yeah sorry historical and societal arguments can not be made in 5 min videos . 
  : / you are the one that claims the soviets were annihilating just as much as the nazis . 
  well 95 % of jewish in lithuania were killed . 
  that 's a very effective killing machine . 
  did the soviets achieve the same percentage of success ? 
   to become same evil they fought against . 
  are they the same evil though ? 
  the holocaust in the baltic states was extremely effective . 
  90 % of jewish were killed . 
  in lithuania alone 95 % of jewish were killed . 
  that 's extremely high rates of extermination .

   less meat or meat of a different animal is n't the same ballpark as less sugar . 
  can you give any examples of a product at the same price point in ee and we that have less meat ? 
   for example 7 days mini croissants comes in spumante ( sparkling wine ) flavour in poland and \u010cere\u0161\u0148a ( cherry ) flavour in slovakia , but mainly kakao flavour in germany . 
  well that 's plain gross . 
   he 's a social-democrat , like mitterrand was or like corbyn is dude , do you know anything about french politics ? 
  and football and rugby are english, 
  is it the same brand of tuna can ? 
  or just all tuna cans should be the same ? 
  that 's like saying all baguettes should be the same wherever you buy ... not going to happen . 
   it is . 
  this is like saying the people in czech republic are less human than people in germany or have that their live have less value . 
  you enter the thorny discussion about what `` quality '' is . 
  how hard is it to find good baguettes outside france ? 
  should the eu regulate on that so that if you call something a baguette it should have the same quality as in france ? 
  what about croissants ? 
  that i have no doubt . 
  the same goes for berlusconi . 
   but any comparison between him and trump is an insult to everybody 's intelligence . 
  well i guess that 's what it boils down to . 
  omg trump is so bad and americans are so stupid ... at least our leader was n't thaaat incompetent . 
  yeah ... yeah he was . 
  in the 90s , italy friggin mattered at the table of eu politics . 
  it mattered also because it had an economy of comparable size with that of france of uk . 
  in 3 years , us economy will do just fine , at it has been . 
  sure at an international stage , us ' image will be tainted . 
  but it does n't even come close to the ridiculous levels berlusconi achieved in undermining italian economy * and * international image . 
   based on how you 're talking , it seems like you were n't even born when berlusconi left italian politics . 
  let 's just say that i 'm old enough to remember that in the 90s , italy had a stong enough economy to actually matter in eu politics . 
  nowadays ... well , i do n't think i need to continue speaking . 
   gdp growth is not the only indicator of the stability of an economy oh gdp shows that we 're fucked ... welp . 
  better ignore it . 
   but italian economic woes are to be blamed on the public debt the italian governments took on in the 1980s at insane interest rates that forced successive governments into permanent austerity to pay the interest on that debt well by the time berlusconi got to power at the beginning of the naughts , well https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fblogs.ft.com%2fftdata%2ffiles%2f2016%2f05%2fitalian_net_government_interest_payments-column_chart-ft-web-themelarge-600x396.png?source=next&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;width=600 the interests paid stabilised . 
  sure it was high , but it was n't as high as the previous decade . 
  now compare gdp growth in the 90s vs gdp growth in the 00s . 
  [ and you 'll realise that berlusconi did shit . ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=485042400000&amp;tend=1431727200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  he was given a country that was in much better health than in the decades before , and managed to shit all over it . 
  things were starting to be stabilised . 
  meanwhile the us does n't really show any signs of being under threat . 
   actually the italian economy started to sink after berlusconi left . 
  http://www.economist.com/node/18780831  between 2000 and 2010 italy 's average growth , measured by gdp at constant prices , was just 0.25 % a year . 
  of all the countries in the world , only haiti and zimbabwe did worse . 
   with is psd increasing public sector wages at an exaggerated rate , at the detriment of infrastructure investment . 
  you 're losing doctors , nurses and teachers faster than you 're losing quality of roads . 
  the brain drain is something you can not afford . 
   berlusconi on the other hand started as a cruise singer and become a billionaire . 
  who gives a flying fuckaroo ? 
   a guy like trump would have not resisted a week in our politics the fact that berlusconi lasted so long is significative . 
  i 'll leave you with a tiny quote : http://www.economist.com/node/18805327  as our special report in this week 's issue points out , only zimbabwe and haiti had lower gdp growth than italy in the decade to 2010 . 
  in fact gdp per head in italy actually fell .
