  yeah man . 
  italy under berlusconi had gdp growth that surpassed only powerhouses like haiti and zimbabwe . 
  think about that for a moment ... 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  http://www.economist.com/node/18805327  as our special report in this week 's issue points out , only zimbabwe and haiti had lower gdp growth than italy in the decade to 2010 . 
  in fact gdp per head in italy actually fell . 
  dude , berlusconi fucked you up terribly . 
  horribly . 
  so one was a proven incompetent , the other remains to be seen ? 
  okay with that . 
   how do you know that when sweden does n't collect crime statistics with ethnicity of perpetrator ? 
  do you know the difference between ethnicity and nationality ? 
   deciding who is the most competent is an horrible yet easy choice . 
  did you look at the state of the italian economy ? 
  compare that to the state of the american economy . 
  for the majority of the last decade , he was in power . 
  and it was during the last decade that italy simply stopped keeping up . 
   if the millions of ukrainians will continue to move to poland it 's not like millions of romanians and polish moved out of romania and poland . 
  what 's your point ? 
  poor people move out for better prospects . 
  breaking news ? 
   5.7 % yoy growth with a psd government , going to have to call a suicide hotline . 
  i am still expecting the destruction of the romanian economy because minimum wage increased . 
  aaaaaany minute now . 
  aaaaaaaaaaany minuuuuuuute . 
  it 's almost like very poor people when given a little money , spend it directly in the economy . 
   one of them is more competent surely you do n't mean berlusconi ? 
  maybe one day they 'll achieve that goal . 
  * mic drop *, 
   but ukraine did not ban imports from russia . 
  they 're still importing a lot of things from russia . 
  baby steps . 
  baby steps . 
  that could be a branch of the eu organisation that deals with development funds . 
  / u/freespeechiscancer does n't have a half bad idea ... we should innovate . 
  eu is about doing things that have n't been done before . 
  fuck , move it every 10 years . 
  might be difficult with people that have families and homes but if done in a timely manner it could be arranged . 
   or totally ignored . 
  did you not vote for the legislative elections in 2007 ? 
  those were the people that voted for the eu in our name . 
  you should have went out and voted man . 
   make immigrants qualify for becoming eu citizens by becoming self-sufficient , living in the eu for 5 years or so and not committing a crime during that time . 
  you mean like it already is now ? 
   germany is our best eurobro . 
  belgium is our best eurobro . 
  italy is definitely our eurocousin . 
  germany is our workmate . 
   in no small part to retain eu membership but scotland will not retain eu membership . 
  that should be made clear . 
  scotland will have to apply for eu membership . 
   however , no senior eu figure would throw even a crumb of encouragement or do anything other than be purposely vague on the request of david cameron to try and scupper independence . 
  well that 's not eu 's business . 
  uk internal business is uk internal business . 
  that 's something brexiters did n't understand when negociations did n't start before a50 was triggered . 
  and that 's something that wo n't change now . 
   but you would rather throw all of that away * 1 ) i 'm just a common citizen , just like the majority of redditors here . 
  no one 's opinions are actually worth jack . 
  * 2 ) the mood in the eu seems to drift away from `` yeeey let 's make the eu bigger . 
  why ? 
  so the eu can be bigger !! 1 ! '', 
  to `` countries that want to actually get involved in the eu projects and are on the same wavelength as we are , should join . '', 
   it is honestly extremely demoralising to see the same attitude coming in a different form from so many people on this sub . 
  there 's nothing to be demoralised . 
  you are taking things a bit too personally . 
  instead of putting yourself in your own shoes , start thinking what joining the eu is actually about . 
  eu is also a project that is on the verge of changing . 
  yet scotland does n't express any desire or roadmap to join projects ** that are already present ** . 
  what will it do when new iterations of the eu will be put forth ? 
  it 's time to be realist about things and realise how much desire there is to join the current eu and whatever . 
   where is your crusade against sweden or poland or bulgaria or the others ? 
  do you have videos of their heads of state saying they do n't want to join the euro before they got into the eu ? 
   i honestly do n't know what you want to achieve here other than being immensely salty for no clear reason . 
  just explaining things through . 
  people do n't want a new tiny uk or a new orban . 
   nicola sturgeon for not suggesting scotland instantly joints it . 
  she told her voters that she does n't want to join . 
  that 's unacceptable . 
  do n't need to get defensive . 
  there is no obligation to join the eu nor is there any obligation to accept scotland in the eu . 
  if scotland does not want to participate in the european project ... with all the things it implies ( one of the being committement to join the eurozone ) then scotland has no business being in the eu . 
   how many french republicans voted for same sex marriage ? 
  that makes no sense whatsoever . 
  the configuration of the govt and the way bills were passed have nothing in commong between uk and france . 
  in france , it became a partisan issue instead of being up to anyone to decide . 
  by your logic , we can say that france is much more progressive than uk because we had civil unions since 1999 while uk had them since 2004 . 
   they would probably be considered dangerous `` socialists '' in the us eh . 
  wauquiez would most definitely not be considered a dangerous socialist . 
   if you show up late to work and do n't get shit for it , then show up late again and again , it 's sending a message . 
  if you 're late for work because you do n't have enough money to buy a super fast car so you have to take the bus , it 's not exactly your fault is it ? 
  firing someone because of that would deffo send a message : ** do not work at this company ** . 
  and clients ** do not buy from this company ** . 
  france does n't have a deficit because omg it 's so so so happy to see its debt increase . 
  we just love it . 
  the political and economic situation is simply such that it did n't allow for the deficit to go under 3 % . 
  for 2017 , it does seem to be the case . 
  again , you clearly do n't understand the difference between enforcement of a rule ( which can be selection for reasons ) or a rule not applying * at all * . 
   no the facts are nicola sturgeon said she would n't choose to join the euro at this time . 
  that 's not what she said . 
   `` if scotland is independent ... we want scotland to be a full member of the european union , '' she said , adding : `` ** we do n't want to go into the euro .
