  ** no member of the eu can be forced into the euro . '' that is a duplicitous speech that no eu politician wants to hear again . 
  holding one speech at brussels and another at home . 
   i 'm legitimately not understanding where all this hate is coming from . 
  there is no hate . 
  all new members commit to eventually accept the eu . 
  the eu is kind enough to let the countries do it at their own pace , but since sturgeon holds a speech that makes it from the get-go certain that she will fight some things that she has to commit to , then no one forces eu countries to let scotland join . 
  eventually yes . 
  just like the eu should eventually fine germany for its budget violations . 
  that being said , surely you can sense that there 's a difference between a cop that tells you ok , i wo n't fine you today for speeding and the justice system telling you that laws do not apply for you , so speed all you want whenever you want . 
  cherry picking here is telling france that budget regulations do not apply to them . 
  you and / u/europeanman are probably the only ones that actually were honest about the last question and actually thought it through without giving some boilerplate feel-good answer . 
  not political moderation is not possible , but transparency is needed . 
  so kudos for that one guys . 
  i upvote any commentator that can moderate in a different timezone than europe . 
   are we understanding the same facts here ? 
  the facts are that sturgeon holds one speech in front of her voters and will have to hold another speech in front of eu politicians . 
  or do you think eu politicians completely ignore internal politics of countries and do n't really speak english so they have no idea what sturgeon is proposing . 
  that shit matters in negociations . 
  we do n't want a new orban in the eu . 
   force eastern europe to import people it does n't want when there was no talk about this when these countries joined the eu . 
  nobody wants to force ee to do shit . 
  we had to , and frankly no one likes it because we know it 's a temporary patch . 
  do you think we leaders are eager to meet their ee leaders and tell them to continue fighting corruption ( like it happened in romania ) or whatever ? 
  that 's the reason why some eu countries are starting to prefer a multi speed eu . 
  we need not be tied constantly to each other . 
  some come move in one directions others in other directions that will reflect their own views and desires . 
   cherry picking ~ ~ is ~ ~ was a fact of life for the eu . 
  ftfy, 
   this is n't being special , no eu member can be forced to adopt the euro you wo n't get in the eu with that sentiment of entitlement to special treatment . 
  politicians are n't exactly dumb , are they ? 
  the good ol' days of letting everybody in because eu must grow to spread its values blah blah are over . 
   i 'm really enjoying watching this sub turn on scotland . 
  that 's because you people do n't understand one thing : no cherry picking !, 
  fucking jesus can want to join the eu but if he wants to cherry pick , he 'll get told : no !, 
   swedish model is fine thanks . 
  we 'll adopt the euro ... eventually . 
  yeah man . 
  just like you 'll join the eu ... eventually . 
  poland and romania do meet the economic requirements . 
  oddly they did n't start the process though . 
   that 's pretty nice that our export goes mainly within the eu but i am writing about theoretical possibility that in the future no matter how much of our export goes into the eu member states countries we can end up in situation where being a member state of the eu will be problematic/impossible from our side like for example common tax system or common migrant policy which are on the table currently . 
  then what you need is a multi speed eu . 
   what will be this symbolic `` european success '' - french-german car , electric bicycle , frozen yogurth ? 
  european defense ? 
  european scientific achievements like cern ? 
   italy and france playing ping pong with refugees/migrants not really no . 
  merkel did n't have to act because of calais . 
  but i agree in your other analysis . 
  it 's delusional to blame stuff on merkel . 
   no but a lot fewer truckdrivers would be hired . 
  that 's a very strange hypothetical . 
  germany has very strong labour laws , yet they do not suffer from unemployment ...  but they are for sure protected against these terrible jobs thay they want to do . 
  hey even slaves were fed . 
  honestly i 'm done with this / r/badeconomics thread . 
  cheers . 
   he can read from a script when opening international events , like the sochi winter olympics in 2014 . 
  he can say a few words in a conversation , but it 's obvious that he replies in russian because he 's more comfortable with it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usqsnd6mr88 he does n't have at all a thick accent . 
   you ca n't be perceived as a strong russian leader if your english sounds silly . 
  his accent is way better than many many russians . 
  people , people . 
  calm down . 
  / u/executivemonkey is a high quality troll that does some serious wordplay . 
  case in point :  how else are people going to learn not to have accidents ? 
  see ? 
  `` having an accident '' is something that happens beyond your will and capabilities . 
  you can not learn to not have accidents , anymore that you can learn to win at the lottery . 
  what you people can learn is stop being to tightass and dumbass and downvote feverishly . 
   because he is the russian president and his main concern is that his people understand him . 
  so russian people check ** american ** media to read on putin ? 
  yeah right . 
   most heads of states do this . 
  here 's an example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvlgity2tym that 's an official context where you ** do ** check what your heard of state is saying and doing . 
  it also provides high quality translations . 
  omg we tried helping you guys with colonialism and then n\u00e9o-colonialisme like francafrique . 
  why are n't you guys doing better ? 
   why must you be such a totalitarian dictator ? 
  omg i think that ikea is rich enough to pay drivers proper salaries . 
  : o such a totalitarian . 
   how they live their own lives . 
  oh yes , it 's a life choice to live in a truck . 
  stop trying to pretend ikea would go bankrupt if drivers wo n't live in trucks . 
  and stop checking these comment sections feverishly . 
  go outside a bit . 
   i have to correct you , even i am not a big fan of him see . 
  that 's proof that he speaks english . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/putin-comey-firing-trump-russia-had-nothing-to-do-with-it-fbi-investigation-a7728916.html check the second video in the article , not the main one . 
  and here 's proof of him pretending not to speak english . 
  you have the whole fake translation his translator is giving him , even though after hes question , he immediatly starts replying to her in russian ... 
   he most likely earns a higher wage than he would in his home country ? 
  he becomes better off by taking that job . 
  because that higher salary now , can result in a lower quality of life and reduced life expectancy for one simple example . 
  this can influence the quality of their work . 
  no one should be living in their trucks for months at a time . 
  in paris it costs 1.90 but you get access to as many buses and subways you want for some 75m iirc . 
  much better value for money . 
   supported the far-right norbert hofer during the austrian presidential elections . 
  and that did n't tip the balance in his favour ? 
  shocked !, 
   should he pretend he does n't speak russian ?
