  what is he going to do about it ? 
  an eu wide minimum wage that depends on the level of development of each country . 
  http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/02/14/pay-rise-eastern-europe/ i want to see polish people fighting against wage increases . 
  but anti eu are not anti-nationalis . 
  romanian minimum wage increased quite a bit recently . 
  which is a good thing . 
   bnr and isarescu 's fault ... and they 're not romania ? 
  the head of the romanian national bank is named by the romanian parliament . 
   marseilles was made by netflix ? 
  yeah it was made by netflix . 
  he might be a blood thirsty dictator that destroyed half of europe , but he 's ** our ** blood thirsty dictator that destroyed half of europe . 
   it 's a much better netflix show what do people call netflix shows now ? 
  because it was made by arte ? 
  i prefer her daughter . 
  a true leveled headed monarch . 
   romanians care about eu elections relative to national elections as much as french . 
  but romania is : * a ) a much recent addition to the eu project , so it 's all fresh and new * b ) are ** huge ** fans of the eu * c ) due to how seats are given , their vote counts more than a french * d ) as you can see , ee is a ** huge ** fan of federalisation . 
  something does not add up ... http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/turnout.html * slovakia 13 % turnout * cz republic 18 % * poland : 23 % the lowest 3 turnout rates come from ee . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
   iohannis was on point when he said that the only country opposing romania 's schengen entry is actually romania . 
  it 's the same thing for the euro . 
   wrong , eastern countries are one of most pro-eu and pro-federation countries ok . 
  so what 's the turnout for * european * elections ? 
  seems to me ee countries constantly rank lower in turnout that other . 
  god , we people complain too much !, 
  they 're too busy doing whatever shit they 're doing instead of protecting the essential computer grids . 
  afterwards you 'll hear that they maor freedom to trample our rights and weaken our security because of terrorists . 
   my evidence is the fact that leave won . 
  did uk vote to leave europe ? 
  do you hear yourself or are you trolling because you sound ridiculous . 
   why car and mali and not nigeria or other african place that is war torn ? 
  did nigeria ask for help ? 
   it seems as far away to most people as america or asia . 
  part of the island mentality . 
  i did you just assume your feelings apply to a 3 nations ? 
  seems that you can blame your friends from the nsa https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/05/an-nsa-derived-ransomware-worm-is-shutting-down-computers-worldwide/ instead of reporting 0days they 're using them . 
  and when they leak , we get shit like this . 
  exactly !, 
  imagine your medical machinery running on windows me !, 
  well maybe russia can invade finland then ? 
  or you know ... he knows that if he wants qe to stop and the euro to grow against the dollar , he 'll have to offer something in exchange . 
  i thought prick is n't an insult . 
  i was already called a prick by the mods . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5z4jka/scottish_independence_nicola_sturgeon_to_ask_for/devhebs/ i am extremely confused . 
  neah man . 
  they really stand a chance to win the uefa cup in ( floor ( < curreny_year  / 4 ) +1 ) * 4 . 
   `` we 're all europeans united in love < 3 '' i 'll quote your dear maggie . 
  no no no . 
  that 's not having your cake and eating it then . 
  they received far more benefits than other eu net contributers . 
   uk has been a net contributor to the eu for decades . 
  but they received other benefits for being part of the club ... 
  we 'll have more speeds in the eu than a mountain bike . 
   eurofederalist that does n't want to :  this means that i would have to relocate to france after i graduate and work here for two years to get french nationality just in order to get european citizenship , which would allow me to further my career options . 
  i think it 's absolute madness , given that i was born a european citizen and i now have that ripped away from me and thinks :  and equally , regarding my future , i 'm having to make serious lifestyle choices about where to live post-graduation to decide how valuable eu citizenship is to me professionally . 
  i 'm literally having to change my life in order to get around brexit -- it 's madness . 
  what ? 
  she wanted to work for the eu from uk ? 
  of course she 'd have to move ** to another country ** . 
   i do n't get why everyone here is so hostile , it 's not exactly that strange she wants to work for the the eu , it 's been her path for the last few years and all of that is ripped apart , well it 's not strange to want that , it 's strange to think she 'll get that . 
   i can see why one would be upset she should appreciate that people were * honest * with her in detailing what the outlook is . 
  it 's quite rare for a recruiters to do that . 
  usually they go yeah yeah send your resume and they just bin it . 
  they told her : get citizenship and we 'll talk . 
   obviously macron sees this as a european investment program into france , meaning they want outside money and themselves being a benefitor . 
  so you read that somewhere ? 
  you 're full of it . 
   whether you 've got the right to adopt a child or not is a completely different matter no ... it 's part of the principle of marriage . 
   who are being denied the adoption of children ok so you do n't understand the concept of positive rights . 
   obviously holy shit !, 
  you 're macron ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  : o omg that 's awesome . 
  gimmicky yet quickly forgettable ? 
  so all the songs are in english bar 3 ? 
  i wan na hear foreign languages . 
   without significant political integration . 
  that 's awesome . 
  macron also proposes a eu finance minister . 
  that 's political integration . 
   thus `` enjoy '' the same rights as any heterosexual couple holy shit this is annoing . 
  legal partnership ** is not ** marriage . 
  in a marriage , the couple can adopt a child . 
  in switzerland they ** can not ** do that . 
   switzerland was the first country on this planet to allow such gay rights through a democratic vote . 
  yeah partial rights . 
  big whoop . 
  france had the pacs since 1999 . 
   we talk . 
  who the fuck is `` we '' ? 
  your vote is worth jack shit and my vote it worth slighly less jack shit but still jack shit . 
  calm down merkel . 
  why was / r/europe pushing french people to vote ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/ look at ** all time ** top 3 comments here . 
  what would have happened had le pen won ? 
  surely if france is not important then the euro , the eu and schengen can do very well without it . 
   we just want to bring it back on a reasonable/healthy level . 
  what 's a `` healthy '' level ? 
  unemployment in switzerland is incredibly low . 
  i fail too see what issues you have with immigrants .
