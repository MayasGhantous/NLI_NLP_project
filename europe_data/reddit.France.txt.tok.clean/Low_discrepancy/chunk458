  a small country with a ton of international institutions and a banking center ... and you 're amazed that you have immigration . 
  wtf ? 
   the u.s do n't trust europe . 
  i cri evertime :'( . 
   and even if germany were to agree , many of the other members would not . 
  such a change would need unanimity . 
  probably the only other eurozone countries against would be austria and netherlands which should be conviced . 
  on the other side you have france , italy , spain ( and smaller countries like greece , portugal ) . 
  population wise there 's a huge imbalance . 
   when the current policies start to produce results it 's been 10 fucking years of crisis . 
  and germany should offer a counter proposition . 
   yeah , no . 
  that 's not a proposition . 
   switzerland has a better lgbt rights record than ... ireland . 
  you mean the country that had a ref to give gay marriage ? 
  when the us had to pass it through a court of people that are unelected ? 
   france and other countries did n't want any transfer of national sovereignty . 
  france was in favour of eurobonds for a long time . 
  now we 've elected a guy that wants an eu wide finance ministery . 
  but again ... it must be the fault of france . 
  bad people do bad things . 
  let 's get a list of american terrorists , american kkk people etc. 
  well that 's what matters . 
  of course germany as a whole pays more , but you as an individual pay ** less ** . 
  and that 's what matters . 
   will be used as a political/negotiating tool , disappointing hey do n't feel so bad . 
  at least your vote is worth twice as much as my vote at the ep . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_in_the_european_parliament, 
   at the very least that stance is based on facts as we are contributing the most money by far . 
  per capita netherlands contributes the most . 
  ** by far ** . 
   surely you agree that choosing france as the main seat of the european parliament was a way to appease the french ? 
  well the french back then were calling the major shots . 
  so yes , we made a gift to ourselves . 
  [ treat . 
  self !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsabtmt1_m0 ), 
  frankly the only time merkel showed she had guts and leadership was in the refugee crisis and that too happened when ee was swamped with refugees . 
  might it right . 
  germans should surely know that . 
  surely . 
  how about we give them the ep and in exchange we ask for it to : * have full powers of a parliament * be proportional so that each country gets seas proportionally to its population . 
  we 'd just have to wait till 2050 :d, 
   well , yeah , it kinda was a gift . 
  you seem to forget that up to the reunification of germany , france was the powerhouse of the ecsc , eec et al. 
   there is no chance that this exchange happens . 
  maybe they want a frexit ? 
  yeah ... i wonder why the eu was shitting their pants 1 week ago ... 
  said the guy that quoted a comment that was rendered irrelevant 5 comments ago . 
  amazing arguments indeed . 
  we have quality discussions on / r/europe . 
   if french president uses the iphone we are not sure if the us is listening . 
  he uses a phone made by thales . 
   the eu ? 
  the eu 's job should n't be to build industries . 
  and it is not . 
  sponsor research sure , but building industry , no . 
   we need a processor okay ... who 's gon na fork out the money then ? 
   all regardless how effective it will be against multinationals , so it is pretty much terribad . 
  companies should pay their fair share of taxes . 
  anything less is ridiculous . 
   it is like using a baseball bat to do the job of a screwdriver . 
  where do you get these comparisons , because they 're ridiculous . 
   european companies have the money , it is not the job of companies to invest in start-ups . 
   they just prefer it to turn into profits rather than investments or research they do quite a bit of investment and research . 
  airbus , nuclear , trains , etc. 
   she barely survived the whitewater scandal so she 's innocent ? 
   her foundation is a legal corruption scheme legal corruption ? 
  do you hear yourself ? 
   the is completely two faced in her omg , she should go to jail naaao, 
  i think you hit the nail on the head . 
  america is a yuge market . 
  in europe , the best you can do is some 90 million ( the german speakers ) . 
  after you have to chop it down , translate etc etc. 
  there are also different laws regarding privacy etc. 
  and we 're not exactly big spenders eithern unlike the americans . 
   i also know some colleagues from my university who had to go to u.s. to pitch to vc ( venture capital ) companies because nobody in eu was interested . 
  we do n't have money to burn like the us has . 
   and these eu 's commission plans to attack tech industry with their mad plans against apple and other multinationals ai n't helping this picture either . 
  myes . 
  let 's remove all taxes to us corporate giants . 
  that will sure improve our tech industry . 
  that makes 100 % sense . 
   `` an unequal treatment of creditors without clear criteria and a base in the law , and payment of old debt to just one category of creditors , open a possibility of lawsuits , '' fizulic said . 
  well i see this going the route of argentina . 
   she was a crook and hacked . 
  hc a crook ? 
  really ? 
  what did she do ? 
  in french it 's ben . 
  or in arabic , ben to mean son of, 
   once again good luck with that . 
  of course that wo n't happen . 
  no group will leave the eu . 
  either the main eu countries fr and gr strong arm those that do n't fall in line . 
  ireland is also very very dependent on the future brexit negociations . 
  much more than france or germany . 
  or we 'll most likely see a gradual leave from countries . 
  if france leaves , the eurozone , eu and schengen become basically irrelevant . 
  yeah .
