  [ maybe if she 'll do her voodoo ? 
   they will increase even more after one or two more terrorist attacks will happen . 
  where did i hear this again before ... 
  no , no , no !, 
   watch out though . 
  it was 82-18 fifteen years ago . 
  remove another 17 % next time and they win . 
  she was 41 , 1 week ago . 
  depends . 
  the phrase `` values and rules of free democracy are observed in poland . '', 
  is most definitely not what the author meant to say . 
  they used indefinite nouns so it makes it seem like * some * values and rules are respected and not all values or * the * values . 
  i wonder what the_cheeto think : does eating a dick make you more of a cuck or less compared to voting macron . 
   let them vote !, 
    surely our european values have rubbed off on them and they will massively vote against the death penalty . 
  if le pen wins , she 'll want to implement a death penalty referendum . 
  i wonder if belgium would ban french from doing that . 
   the question is , as ever in international law , whether and how it is enforced . 
  they can very well leave the council of europe . 
  they have no obligation to remain . 
   they are not part of the justice system . 
  it 's pretty pointless to discuss something with someone that does n't even know the ** basics of their own country ** . 
  the constitutional court not being part of the justice system . 
  smh . 
   the death penalty is an integral part of islam not just . 
  marine le pen also wants a referendum to put in place the death penalty . 
  are you saying mlp and fn are islamic ? 
   european convention on human rights that was signed in 1950 , and i 'm sure as you know , death penalties were not abolished in 1950 . 
  i think it was amended but baning the death penalty is n't a main concern is seems for the echr . 
  it 's the council of europe that 's very much against death penalty . 
  and turkey is part of it . 
   planned rewrite of history working together with islamic countries . 
  god you people are pathetic . 
   new history books will say that islam has always been a part of french culture , which is a lie are you stupid ? 
  besides the fact that you can not read french , the slides say that history classes will mention the ** common history in the med sea basin ** . 
  a common history of muslims , jewish and europeans . 
  open a geography book . 
   so , you know . 
  no big deal . 
  the fact that your educational system failed you is a big deal . 
   it was about investigating if abuse of influence ( a person that has a lead function in a party uses his influence or authority to obtain unjust advantages or goods ) . 
  do you understand that ** such a thing does not exist ? 
  ** look at what a party whip does : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whip_%28politics%29 the head of the party can threaten the parliamentaries to kick them out if they do n't vote like he says ** because it 's a political process ** . 
  if you dislike it , in 3 years vote for other people . 
  but it 's a political process and it 's legal . 
  tomorrow a politician can decide to put up for voting a law that states that corruption acts can no longer imply prison sentences ... and that 's ok . 
  if it passes the parliament , it becomes law and there 's shit you can do until you change parliament . 
  and ** if ** the law is wrong , it 's the constitutional court to decide . 
  at no point does the dna get involved . 
  did you read the constutional court report ? 
  https://www.ccr.ro/files/products/decizia_68+opinie.pdf  ministerul public nu are competen\u021ba de a desf\u0103\u0219ura activit\u0103\u021bi de cercetare penal\u0103 cu privire la legalitatea \u0219i oportunitatea unui act normativ adoptat de legiuitor the dna ( ministerul public ) has no competency in doing a penal inquiry ** regarding the opportunity or legality ** of a normative act . 
  basically it 's not their business . 
   the dna started this investigation after it received a complaint , which they 're obligated to follow through . 
  check the report , pt 123 . 
  the dna interviewed a large amount of people , they created a situation of stress and tension in the govt impeding their right to carry on their work . 
   also , why do n't you also post what they found in this investigation ? 
  because ** it is irrelevant ** . 
  do you understand what a prosecutor is ? 
  in a penal trial for example , like in this case , the prosecutor * is one side * and the defendents * the other * . 
  * unless the trial is over * , there is a ** pressumption of innonce ** . 
  just because a prosecutor says something , does n't make it true . 
  unless the trial happens and the judge/jury decides in their favour . 
   so i 'd take any ruling they do which favours the rulling party with a grain of salt . 
  you have a very messed up mentality if you take the word of prosecutors and police above the word of the justice system . 
  i read that like ` found the poof ! '', 
   especially since the us legalised corruption and bribery totally not a populist comment . 
   have such low turn out and a people who often believe voting is pointless `` because everyone is corrupt . '', 
  the far simpler solution would be to encourage people to not vote for corrupt people . 
   did n't work for le pen or fillon . 
  that against is a ridiculously oversymplified comment and contradiction . 
  you state that corruption in the political class breeds low turnout , before you mentioned corrupt french politicians . 
  yet amazingly , you fail to see how french turnout is very high . 
  you take one issue : corruption and you claim it is the main evil for everything . 
   erm , no . 
  being against corruption is the opposite of populism . 
  erm , that 's exactly the populist attitude / u/thelastgoodemperor mentionned . 
  populism as we see it nowadays involves simplification of actions and complex processes , exacerbating problems and finding a few simple causes that may or not be factual . 
  saying that you 're fighting the good cause and finding a few good sound bytes that sound well help so much . 
  saying you 're fighting corruption is much more easier than saying the difficult : the rule of law should still stand . 
  you mention the exceptional dna but apparently are ignorant of the faults and abuse of power it involved . 
   similar to the way romania made the dna agency so strong . 
  it 's so strong that the romanian constitutional court had to rule that dna overstepped its constitutional bounds when it started an investigation on the govt decree oug 13 ( the one that dealt with changing the penal code fiasco that happened ) . 
  sources : http://www.romania-insider.com/constitutional-court-finds-conflict-romanias-government-dna/ https://www.agerpres.ro/english/2017/03/10/ccr-reasoning-for-ruling-on-dna-gov-t-conflict-legislator-delegate-alone-competent-to-decide-on-oug-timeliness-17-08-39  the constitutional court believes that by investigating how the bill was adopted , ** dna has disrupted the normal functioning of the government and the relationships that must exist between the judicial , executive and legislative ** , ccr president valer dorneanu said on monday . 
  & nbsp ;  ** all the facts highlighted in the complaint were actually related to aspects intrinsic to the legislation adoption procedure , namely aspects related to timeliness and legality which do not fall within the authority of criminal investigation bodies , regardless of the legal classification established by the prosecutor ** . 
  since , by itself alone , the adoption of regulatory acts can not be a constitutive element of offence , the court finds that the facts incriminated in the complaint that was the starting point for case no . 
  46 / p / 2017 ( ... ) do not fall under criminal law , regardless of their legal classification , '' the cited document reads . 
  emphasis mine . 
  romanian constitutional court press release https://www.ccr.ro/noutati/comunicat-de-pres-238 and full decision https://www.ccr.ro/files/products/decizia_68+opinie.pdf they intervened in a political/legislative/regulatory process and prosecutors had no business being involved in it . 
  fighting corruption and all illegal actions is good but prosecutors and the police should ** not ** overstep constitutional bounds and gain too much power . 
  read the meta data by yourself . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
   if said apparatus loses confidence in a pm , / r/thathappened, 
   a pm can be replaced by the parliament , by that logic the parliament can refuse to follow the president , producing a cohabitation and inducing the country to a hault . 
   also , 49.3 . 
  i fail to see the problem with that frankly . 
  had the ps been so against it , they would have vote the govt out like it is possible . 
  how 's that different from a pm that has control of the parliament ? 
  at least our french president wo n't last for an eternity . 
   he 's also honorary `` canon '' you 'll be disappointed if you click on this link . 
  this is why speaches of `` remember how nice everything was in the good ol' days '' are absolutely irrelevant .
