   besides colonization itself , one of europe 's biggest mistakes was not educating women and bringing birthrates down in our colonies . 
  colonization was never about educating people . 
   it tripled . 
  so did spain , iceland , and the netherlands . 
  nothing too whacky . 
  much more easy to triple when you have a small population than a large one . 
  [ norman borlaug also contributed heavily ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_borlaug ), 
   they are just publisging the stuff . 
  they are publishing the emails and saying they 're probably deffo real totes . 
  after they say , omg do n't blame russia guys and then accusing the macron 's team for saying that some of the mails are fake . 
   paper factory for mein kampf did the paper factory say that what 's written in mk is totes real and please do n't blame the nazis ? 
  if you love the poor so much , how come you 're rooting for a company that makes it impossible for poor people to live in decent areas in big cities ? 
   if the apartment or house is private property they should be able to do whatever the fuck they want with it !, 
  where do you live ? 
  because i wan na buy the appartement above yours and overflow the toilets with massive shit . 
   so it 's not macron 's personal emails or data ? 
  from the many screen grabs i saw , no it is n't . 
  how would you even generate 9 gb of email data from one person ? 
  that being said , are you kidding me ? 
  if it were macron 's personal data it would suddenly be ok ? 
  he has no right to personal information and a personal life ? 
  all in the name of transparency ? 
   the content of the emails are what people are interested in , no one gives a flying fuck about the staff . 
  well the emails are from the staff . 
  do you understand the simple concept that the emails were not sent or received by macron ? 
  it 's not a difficult concept . 
   you seem to think the leak is russian oh wow . 
  you read all that from this :  oh wow . 
  so you know where they come from ? 
  did you get any sources ? 
  the gtfo . 
  you have some exceptional powers . 
  or you 're talking out of your ass . 
  hmm i wonder what 's true . 
   wikileaks does good work uncovering bullshit in our politics even if it is russian aligned . 
  https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/492033939142619136 is this uncovering bullshit ? 
  saying that an ukrainian fighter shot down the mh plane ? 
  are you out of your mind ? 
   when you plan to be the authority the people involved ** are regular citizens ** and should be treated as such . 
  is it campaign staff emails . 
  wtf are you on about ? 
  should we treat people differently because they have different jobs ? 
   if you want to keep your privacy and possible shady dealings ( clinton , fillon , gunnlaugsson , etc ) you should n't get into politics . 
  do you understand the concept of fair trial ? 
  even if by magic something evil is in there , it can not be used in a trial since it 's from illegal sources . 
  this was a means to intervene in the election . 
   again , putin did not take crimea for 14 years . 
  how generous of him !, 
   he took it because the west wanted to bind ukraine closer to itself . 
  fuck it , i knew it 's our fault . 
   i 'm not for his actions but they were not irrational . 
  he did it from a very clear motif . 
  so the plane that was shot down ? 
  the 5000 civilians killed in the ukrainian war , that 's rational for you ? 
  are you some sort of crazy person ? 
   i do n't want to be doxxed but if i run for office you can feel free too . 
  there are fucking emails of campaign staff . 
  they 're not at all running for office . 
  can you post ** all your emails ** here please ? 
  i do n't know if you 're innocent or guilty but something might come out of it . 
  thank you . 
   something tells me this leak comes from the left wing , oh wow . 
  so you know where they come from ? 
  did you get any sources ? 
  the gtfo . 
   and he has still not taken the baltic states . 
  maybe because the baltics are in nato ? 
   the actual madman who really has no clue what he is doing sits on the other side of the world and rules over a military that could pick a fight with the entire world . 
  so not the guy that invaded ukraine and fuels a war over there ? 
  okay ... 
   wikileaks is operating in this too , not just pro-russian hackers . 
  wikileaks is fucking pro russian . 
  https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/860580642014285829 here 's them already covering their boss ' ass . 
   if macron or any politician had something to hide , it needs to come to light . 
  if you have something to hide , it needs to come to light . 
  please give me ** all your emails ** . 
  motherfucker !, 
  still i mean snowden was known to be a boastful dick , and he 's probably salty having to remain in russia . 
  probably just your classical bernieboy, 
  neah man . 
  that deffo ca n't be real !, 
  throw me a bone , please . 
  : s wikileaks ca n't be that retarded . 
  i saw your other post about their ukrainian jet . 
  retarded and shills ok . 
  but surely not ** that ** retarded . 
  good to hear snowden is still good . 
  that ca n't be real . 
  can it ? 
  can you friggin read french ? 
  militant means supporter . 
  http://fninfos.fr/ omg here is an website of people that will use militant tactics for le pen . 
  i 'll give you a message after polls close  . 
  do n't get too saltay . 
   according to the emails macron and the national police conspired to infiltrate protest groups who were against him . 
  what fucking email ? 
  show me the source buddy boy . 
  put up or shut up . 
   lots more details including possible collusion with ministry of interior , 8,000,000 million dollar life insurance etc. . lel . 
  do you understand what a life insurance is ?
