  concerning the emails , fuck me it 's the most boring shit ever . 
  campaign spread sheets , borrowing money for the campaign , managing the staff , reading and correcting stuff . 
  sad . 
   spanish is the `` language '' of one full continent : america a continent with very low birthrates . 
  and as time increases , it will remain the same . 
   united states for instance , is expected to become before 2050 the largest spanish speaking country in the world !, 
  spanish will become a vital language for business . 
  spanish will forever be a second class language in the us . 
  the upper class will forever speak english and as the lower classes will want to be perceived upper class , they 'll have to switch . 
   spanish has official status in countries from america , europe and africa ; myes . 
  africa ... equatorial guinea ... 1.7 m people . 
  the_dumpster is already hedging their bets by saying the election will be rigged . 
  sad . 
  true . 
  seppuku on sunday for everybody !, 
   you were saying that an embassy ca n't be closed , and i was using a historical example where it was done . 
  well closing an embassy is contrary to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_convention_on_diplomatic_relations  the premises of a diplomatic mission , such as an embassy , are ** inviolable ** and must not be entered by the host country & nbsp ;  the host country must never search the premises , nor seize its documents or property . 
  article 30 extends this provision to the private residence of the diplomats . 
  i also assumed that germany does n't want to be sent to the international court of justice . 
  you sign a convention , you stick to it . 
  well i assumed here that germany does n't want to start a war . 
   restricting it to just embassies and consulates makes it just about impossible to have a proper vote . 
  consulates are in all major cities . 
  600k votes in the last ref . 
  it can still be done . 
  there are consulates in all major cities i can imagine . 
  that would certainly ease the procedure since host nations can not enter the consulate without the consule letting them . 
   closing the embassy you 're not allowed to close the embassy . 
   if turkey defies this ban , declaring the embassador a persona non grata , banning him from the country they can name a new ambassador and restart the procedure . 
   but the study is not only about native speakers native speakers is pretty irrelevant and odd concept . 
  english is n't powerful because americans speak it . 
  there are more chinese that speak english than americans . 
  it 's all about the power of propagation . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_territorial_entities_where_french_is_an_official_language and i also doubt that they counted these people that live in countries where french is an official language . 
   anyway we know in the future there will be `` 3 major world languages '' : * english * spanish * chinese spanish ? 
  citation needed . 
  either way it 's impossible to tell what languages will be `` the future ones '' . 
  the population boom is expected to be [ in subsaharan africa ] ( http://www.who.int/whr/whr_map7b.jpg ) . 
  your link does n't factor in african countries . 
  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/05/31/ozy-french-language/9781569/ 750 million speakers by 2050 . 
  how will they stop turkey from putting voting booths in the embassy ? 
  it makes it seem like it will block people from going to the polls or punishing them if they do . 
  they 're free to take a plane and go to turkey or go to another country that allows it , or go to the turkish embassy in germany since that 's generally considered foreign soil . 
  the `` not allowing turks living in germany '' would be quite extreme . 
   i 'm not getting your question , sorry . 
  it 's simple . 
  people wan na invest in stuff that has potential to change lives . 
  airplanes , phones , internet technologies , electric cars etc. 
  that makes these economies grow . 
  you do n't grow with real estate . 
   but it truly is something that is important to us . 
  sure but you did n't answer my question . 
  you wo n't build the technology of tomorrow by painting old houses or building 5 story buildings ;, 
  it 's taxes on profit . 
  and the profits were declared in ireland . 
  why would n't it ? 
   so in the end it is you as the consumer who is paying for the taxes , whether it 's corporate tax or vat . 
  that 's awesome . 
  so i should be free to decide which ones i can pay . 
  i 'll choose to pay corporate tax . 
    i never said that populism bothered me ah my bad . 
  see you in 2022 . , 
   the country needed to have a low corporate tax rate . 
  what was done was done . 
  we wo n't redo the past . 
  we should look at the future . 
  but if we repeat the mistakes of the past in the future , we 'll end up without a eu . 
   the eu should not have control of domestic taxation , but i do think there should be an eu wide corporate tax . 
  of what level ? 
   either make it more attractive or lower taxes , or a mixture of both . 
  macron is willing to negociate by lowering taxes . 
   but if we want to raise economic prospects in the eu forcing france 's model on other countries because people are n't investing in france just does n't seem like the right option . 
  and france is at a point now where if ** no harmonization ** is achieved in the eu , you 'll have a second round melenchon-le pen . 
  good luck keeping your model without the eu ( unless you think that the eu and euro will survive without france ) . 
  the eu should be about cooperation not competition . 
  it 's something you people do n't understand . 
   why are you under the impression that you are not paying for the corporate taxes of coca cola when you buy coca cola ? 
  and i consume less coca cola because i pay taxes to the state . 
  should i stop paying taxes to the state ? 
   if france puts up tariffs with the eu . 
  the eu will stop existing though , same with the euro . 
  a trade deal will be signed with germany and other big countries . 
   that 's funny because corporate taxes are perhaps the most populist idea of all . 
  `` tax the corporations !!! '', 
  you pay what you use . 
  corporations use the work force , use the infrastructure , use the protection of the army . 
  they must pay . 
   uk has what as tax rate , and it 'll go lower . 
  weird how populism does n't bother you there and weird how they brexited . 
  of course . 
  but now with brexit happening , i believe power shifts will happen towards harmonization . 
  it 's always good to resort to the last option . 
  and / r/europe is n't exactly a good reflection of european desires . 
   the taxes raised when those coca cola bottles get sold . 
  why should i pay for the wear and tear coca cola causes ? 
  do you understand the concept : pay what you use ? 
   i 'd say try it and see if you like the result . 
  one should not shy away from democracy . 
   i doubt the effects would be that immense . 
  trade will still happen with germany that is our main partner .
