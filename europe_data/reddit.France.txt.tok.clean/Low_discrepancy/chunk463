  i am amazed that the rise of populism does not concern you at all . 
  that you probably think it 's because the us and uk had too high coorporate rates or something . 
   m\u00e9lenchon is not an eu-skeptic . 
  m\u00e9lenchon 's proposed actual solutions to the problem we 're discussing . 
  no , but melenchon is not afraid of going the extra mile and asking for a ref if changes are not implemented . 
   corporations are just constructs in which people organise . 
  so if a driver transporting coca cola bottles is driving on the road , who the fuck is supposed to pay the wear and tear of that road ? 
  the truck driver ? 
   france made a stupid decision , and they reap the bitter fruits . 
  then we 'll have a referendum and see if we want to remain in the eu . 
   a bottom with `` ireland 's gdp per capita and quality of life , unemployment are vastly superior to france 's '' ? 
  they did not obtain said money because of the quality of the r&d , scientific progress or added value . 
  they obtained it because they 're a small nation with access to a huge market . 
  they profit because companies are going there . 
   corporate taxes should be 0 . 
  do n't corporations use roads to deliver goods ? 
  do n't they employ skilled people that had to be educated by a proper education ? 
  do n't they need medical treatment . 
  those profits do n't come out of thin air . 
  corporations should pay their fair share . 
   corporations pass on their corporate taxes to consumers and workers ( by lowering wages ) . 
  that 's not our problem . 
  taxing people also means they spend less on other stuff . 
  such is life . 
   it is much better to raise the equivalent amount of tax on consumption directly we already pay enough vat tax , thank you very much . 
   why not implement ireland 's successful policies in france ? 
  do you understand the concept race to the bottom ? 
   he should remember he is running for the president of france , not the eu . 
  yeah . 
  he said he wants to reduce company tax to 25 % . 
  you think us french are happy that companies will pay less ? 
  you think macron is happy knowing he 'll have less money ? 
  it 's a compromise . 
   `` i will make poland and hungary behave '' that 's bullshit . 
  he 's saying that we should ** harmonize ** . 
  you know what harmonization means ? 
  it means working together and leveling the playing field . 
  hamonize social needs so that workers from romania and poland are n't [ treated like shit ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39196056 ) . 
  hamonize fiscal policies so that ireland does n't have to refuse to accept money . 
   it will mean those countries with the ecosystem will just get stronger and stronger and leave the smaller countries who 's only advantage was an agile and adaptable tax code behind . 
  but you said it yourself . 
  you have a strong ecosystem . 
  if you wan na compete , you should do it through r&d and added value , not through races to the bottom . 
  heck it should n't be a competition but a collaboration . 
  and if one region is doing worse than another , it should be given aid to develop . 
  develop its economic tissue , develop its r&d , develop social rights for people , develop its scientific output . 
  yeah but uk said they wan na reduce immigration . 
  the tories said it . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/25/labour-leadership-agrees-truce-on-immigration-policy it 's hard brexit because all the politicians except lib dems want it . 
   hello ... ireland form 1980 here . 
  france from 2022 . 
  ireland 's gdp per capita and quality of life , unemployment are vastly superior to france 's even though r&d wise , per capita , they 're about in the same league . 
  i do not find this fair at all . 
  on one side , we 'll have pro-eu candidates that say the eu is still the future despite them not being capable to reform it , on the other side anti-eu but pro-european people that say that the eu as is can not be reformed at all , a new political and economic system needs to be produced . 
  who am i to vote for ? 
  i do not disagree with ireland living as well as france or germany . 
  it 's great to do that , but when you 're living much better and refuse any reform to render things more fair , when you people fight and refuse to receive money , i will begin to disagree . 
  a reform of the eu to render it more fair , to achieve convergence is what is needed . 
  and these are the last shots . 
  unless you believe eu and the eurozone can exist without france . 
   also , a huge welfare state is not necessarily a sustainable situation under globalization . 
  i 'll sooner vote for melenchon/le pen and burn the eu to the ground than give up the welfare state . 
   it 's better for us in the long run if we do n't , as long as we remain in the eu . 
  keep saying that and there wo n't be a eu for long . 
  and when ireland is asked to collect the money , they fight the eu . 
  ** who the fuck fights receiving money **, 
   i am still pro-eu , but honestly , depending on how the 5 next years go , i might change my opinion . 
  exactly this . 
  melenchon is just waiting for this to happen . 
   i can see them deciding to leave . 
  yeah they 'll also have to leave the euro . 
   under one european union every country has the exact same rights as everyone else and compromise has to be reached . 
  well france is willing to lower its tax rate to 25 % . 
  what is the irish compromise ? 
  fighting the eu and refusing to accept 12 billion ? 
  fuck that shit . 
   no , having too high tax is what negatively effect certain members . 
  what is france 's rate - 45 % ? 
  so you do n't know france 's taxation rate and you comment ? 
  fuck me what an expert you are . 
   we were able to boost our real estate market oh yes . 
  major source of r&d right there . 
  real estate market . 
  tons of added value . 
  macron wants to lower france 's rate to 25 % . 
  c'mon people 25 % is n't too much.there 's an effort there being made . 
  and if it 's becoming too tough ... well a multi-speed europe might be the way out . 
  i 've never been so excited about anything in my life as this woman is . 
   i was giving an example heeey . 
  just like i did . 
  i gave examples of russia being shitty and hiding their tracks so why you should have a proper investigation . 
  is n't that awesome !, 
   no country will allow unrestricted access to investigators , and that requests to investigate has to be substantiated before considered . 
  go read up on iran and the vast amounts of access investigators have . 
  cheers . 
   she will get at least 40-45 percent this election , after 4 more years of neoliberal multicultural macron i think she got a good short next time . 
  wow . 
  you must be quite an expert on french politics , considering that you do n't even know how long a presidential term lasts . 
   i suspect us bombed that msf hospital on purpose  you have a serious case of whataboutism ... 
   no sane country would allow that syria has no reason to refuse the release of flight plans and the names of helicopter squadron commanders that were most likely involved in transporting this sarin gas across syria .
