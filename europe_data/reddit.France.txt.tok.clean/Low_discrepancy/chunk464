   wtf does helicopter commanders have to do with the attack conducted by jets ? 
  who knows ? 
  maybe they have information about the army transporting the sarin gas by helicopter . 
  it 's not like you transport this shit by fighter plane . 
   ( they just need to say that they believe that their might have been chemical weapons there ) us claim that they know which base it was . 
  if the police suspects you of robbery and you have two homes , i 'm pretty sure they 'll want to check both homes . 
  and homes of people they suspect to be your accomplice . 
   and hell , syria and russia even confirmed that this particular strike was made from that base that 's like catching a robber . 
  if he shows his pockets are empty , you wo n't send him free , will you ? 
  they have to check all the possible supply chains , production storage of sarin gas , man . 
  syria and russia will only let them see what they want them to see . 
  see this documentary how ridiculous the uk policemen investigating litvinenko 's murder were treated by russian authorities . 
  http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hunting-the-kgb-killers if they get to see only what russia and syria let them see , do you think they 'll find damning proof ? 
  of course not . 
  now russians will have a renewed propaganda tool : see the west did n't find anything !, 
   the current bombing campaigns by none countries are about that !, 
  it puts pressure on assad . 
  it shows that there are limits and he can not do whatever he wishes . 
  it 's very important . 
   if you want that , you 're talking about a full on military intervention with armies on the ground . 
  like the kurds ? 
  i 'm from my part all to tired of foreign intelligence agencies lying to achieve goals . 
  give me proofs that french foreign intelligence lied in the past 20 years . 
  give me proof that they lied in this case . 
  if you  because us requested access and names to every base in syria and names of every pilot ( both jets and helicopter pilots ) in syria . 
  is n't funny that someone that lies , like you are doing now , is also shouting about others lying ? 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-resolution-iduskbn17702k  the draft text , seen by reuters , says syria 's government must provide an international investigation with flight plans and logs for tuesday , the ** names ** of all helicopter ** squadron commanders ** and provide access to air bases where investigators believe attacks using chemicals may have been launched . 
  emphasis mine . 
  of course they wanted the whole shabang . 
  russia managed to hide a friggin buk out of eastern ukraine after it bombed an airplane out of the sky . 
  they 're very gifted in hiding their trails . 
   my suggestion is that : how about we do n't contribute further to the crisis , by bombing an already devastated country ? 
  by letting a dictator regain full control of his country and bombing his civilians his chemical agents ? 
  of course you could say that there was peace in apartheid south africa , but was there ? 
  assad has to be rendered in a position of stepping down and letting democratic elections happen in his country ... and that 's not what assad nor russia want . 
  an investigation on military bombing asks for military information ? 
  no fucking way : o, 
   those syrians who actually take the third choice and get the hell out might very well be the most reasonable of the group that 's why i also support giving refugee status to syrians . 
  that 's what merkel did , that 's what macron wants , that 's what obama wanted ** and that 's what le pen and trump are fighting ** . 
   perhaps there should be a un investigation to confirm it first ? 
  putin refuses to let that happen ... 
  i wonder why ? 
  french intelligence said it was assad , i 'm happy with that . 
  proven . 
   also , obama 's lack of concern for his party 's working class base has resulted in it 's near destruction oh . 
  trump will solve the problems poor people have . 
  he 's already planning to add again preexisting conditions in his health care plan . 
  totally for poor people . 
   then we get le pen in 2022 . 
  yeah ... that 's never going to happen . 
  maybe m\u00e9lenchon . 
  but never le pen . 
  she can not debate , she changes policies from one day to another . 
   ofcourse , lets keep bombing the middle east , killing more people , then , we act suprised when we 've created a massive refugee stream . 
  omg . 
  i did n't realise you 're a pacifist . 
  we totally should let assad use sarin gas on his people . 
  that 's what a true humanist would do . 
  see you in 20 years when france will be even more fucked up than it already is boi ya saltay . 
   the same europeans who are angry at trump for missle strikes ? 
  that 's the one good thing trump did . 
   so the frenchmen who will be killed in the attacks during macron 's presidency will be more happy ? 
  well sadly macron does n't have [ le pen 's supernatural capabilites ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g0hd3ap.gifv ) to stop all terrorist attacks . 
  mmmmm . 
  it feels so good . 
  4 more days till i can rub it in the face of extreme nutters on reddit . 
  oh man i ca n't wait . 
  :d heck i 'm posting this so i can hear more juicy comments about `` bbbbbuuuuutttt trump , bbbbbuuuuuutt brexit !, 
  polls lie ! ... '', 
  give us some of that juicy salt . 
   not to mention there being almost no muslims in poland in the first place . 
  so what 's your solution ? 
  you seem so bright and wise . 
  tell us . 
   saying not to buy british with the galileo system . 
  i never bought british galileo . 
  is it any good ? 
  holy shit this is ugly . 
  what friggin style is this ? 
  looks confused as f. 
  le pen does n't even speak english . 
  when this post is 2h old , prince philip will be launched into space in the spacex rocket . 
  [ go greased lightning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kl8a4rnq8&amp;t=52s ), 
  [ what are you talking about ? 
   they ca n't adopt . 
  as the gay couple . 
  any single person can adopt in france . 
  you understand what `` they '' means right ? 
   wrong great you sound like trump and just like trump you presented bullshit . 
   as if usa would give 3 shits about some small countries imposing visa 's . 
  it 's called reciprocity , if they ask you for visas , you ask them for visas . 
  write your mp ** today ** and ask them to vote imposing visas on the us . 
   `` united we stand '' yeah like in dealing with the refugee crisis . 
  i totally see the 5 countries accepting refugees to unload germany . 
  do n't be a hypocritical . 
   but the parliament shouting a lot , those news blowing up , only for the commission to backtrack , only does this : shows that the parliament is useless shows that the institutions are independent and they both have their own procedures . 
  what do you want ? 
  before acting something , both of them to join up and see how feasible it is for something to pass ? 
   ( and disappoint us 5 - `` we should have known , fooled me again . '' ), 
  why does n't croatia impose visas on us citizens ?
