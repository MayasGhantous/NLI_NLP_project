  you 're not in schengen , you can do it right away . 
   we 're used to shit like this , and the rest does n't care about us , business as usual , move along with your day yes when uk was asking to restrict immigration and benefits and merkel said no , i am 100 % sure they wanted to reduce german immigration and not polish . 
   here 's your new motto : `` money is our god ! '', 
  yeah i 'm sure we is the only ones that care about money . 
  why does n't ** your ** country impose visas on american citizens . 
  romania is n't in schengen , they can close the borders to americans . 
  make american soldiers get a visa before entering . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_united_states_citizens romania , croatia , bulgaria are not in schengen . 
  if they so wish , they can impose visas for us citizens . 
  weird how they 're not doing that . 
   is great and all but he barely mention the core problem which is companies moving somewhere cheaper . 
  i shall wait for an article that points that out too . 
  weird how ee does n't mind when companies move from we to ee but any way to achieve convergence in fought . 
  do n't be surprised if the eu lasts less than 15 years with your type of mentality . 
  you provide a statement with no proof and ask me to debunk it ? 
  that 's not how it works , that 's not how any of it works . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russell%27s_teapot if your famous economists are actually worth their salt , they 'd publish their research in international papers . 
  or do they not go to international conferences . 
  how unfortunate indeed that they never published in international papers . 
   that 's because the economy in most eastern european countries ca n't handle it . 
  do you have any studies for that ? 
   alcohol consumption overall and alcoholism is similiar somehow yes . 
  laughing about drinking 2l of vodka is totally about alcohol consumption and not at all about alcoholism . 
  it 's perfectly normal to drink 2l of vodka at one sitting . 
   instead of bringing the countries closer together is n't the eu funding a brain-drain , and essentially supports the corrupt ruling elite in these countries instead of fighting it ? 
  well is n't it odd that people in these countries fight minimum wage increases ? 
  i have seen so many romanians complain that their economy will go to shit because of minimum wage increases . 
  but it 's so manly to laugh of a friggin epidemic that kills so many people . 
  let us all laugh about something that significantly reduced the life expectancy in russia . 
  hahahahahaha ... ha . 
   there is a very large portion very supportive of right wing , citation needed . 
   for the other , we have decent equivalent they ca n't adopt . 
  so no , it 's not a decent alternative . 
   then cultural change virtually put an end to that . 
  then muslims came and violence returned how many muslims are there in croatia that you 're getting attacked by them ? 
  the bill just got 10 billion higher !, 
   it could still be herding , just that the followed the right one . 
  it could , it could be not . 
  i have n't seen much proof of that happening . 
   they will complain because it 's not something those countries can afford due to lower labour productivity . 
  it was easy for the govts of those countries to say : let uk leave cuz they just want to restrict your rights . 
  i wan na see those govts say : let france leave , they just want to increase your wages . 
  if a factory moves in poland , they 'll have ** the same productivity ** as in france . 
  because they have the same tools . 
  unless you mean to say polish are shittiers workers than french . 
   who does not qualify as a refugee but & nbsp ;  but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned , if returned to his or her country of origin , or in the case of a stateless person , to his or her country of former habitual residence , would face a real risk of suffering serious harm and is unable , or , owing to such risk , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . 
  they get to stay . 
   so it 's the same shit . 
   turkey is not their home country . 
   should be returned to the safe countries of origin ** or transit . 
  ** do you read what you write ? 
   http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:distribution_of_first_instance_decisions_on_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_applications , _ 2016 _ ( % 25 ) _ yb17.png http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:distribution_of_final_decisions_on_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_applications , _ 2016 _ ( % 25 ) _ yb17_ii . png so the majority of migrants coming to germany and sweden the country that welcomed the most were actual refugees and were given asylum http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/glossary:asylum_decision first instance decision . 
  and those denied ( which were a minority in germany and sweden ) went to the final decision court after appealing . 
  thank you for proving my point . 
  i 'm done with this convo . 
   s long as northern europe has very generous incentives to migration , they should be responsible for the mess they invite . 
  so then poland wo n't disagree with accepting refugees . 
   tells them he 'll sanction poland due to `` social dumping '' . 
  that is a meaningless statement . 
  one main argument used in the campaign by various people was to impose a eu wide minimum wage ( indexed on the level of the country ) . 
  the point of the eu is to achieve convergence and we 're falling short of that . 
  http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/02/14/pay-rise-eastern-europe/ central and eastern eu is falling short of that . 
  southern europe is also not achieving convergence . 
  heck ee has high wage disparity even in the country . 
  http://www.euractiv.com/section/social-europe-jobs/news/eu-riven-by-big-wage-disparities/  he ca n't do anything as long as france is in the single market . 
  the single market is not some wild wild west . 
  there are conditions to belong and new conditions can be added . 
  i wan na see romania and poland complain that they 'll have to increase minimum wage . 
  or stopping truckers from having to live for months at the time in their cabins . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39196056  same reason why cameron could n't commit cameron wanted something for uk , people in france want people all over the eu to live better and have more rights . 
  tl ; dr : ** convergence in the eu has slowed down and has to be pushed **, 
   a us official told cnn in february that the terror threat in europe was as high as it 's ever been . 
  no , no it 's not . 
   he has been campaigning to close the balkan route since 2015 . 
  it is essentially closed ...  since it happened in 2016 , in part because of the fence that everyone condemned no . 
  it did n't happen because of a ridiculous fence . 
   illegal migrants ** they are not illegal migrants ** since they have not been processed . 
  the majority were asylum seakers . 
   should be returned to the safe countries of origin or transit . 
  yeah , turkey will say no . 
  what then ? 
   in case you are wondering on `` how ? '', 
  that 's partly the next point ( 7 ) . 
  ah good . 
  so what merkel did by proposing a deal with turkey . 
  honestly it 's like talking to a wall . 
  ** the majority of people that came to europe were asylum seakers ** . 
  if they get asylum , they need to be repartitioned in europe . 
  i 'm done with this convo . 
   the `` sanctions on poland '' comments were in the context of a factory moving to lodz . 
  '' how is he a populist ? 
  obviously he 's talking about sanctions because that 's what people understand . 
  but i 'm quite sure in the long run , he 'll favour a multi speed eu approach . 
   in 2015 he already called for a join solution , including letting member states help protect greece 's border , unifying safe country regulation across the eu , and sorting migrants at the border so we should sort the refugees at the aegean sea ? 
   asylum procedures should be completed outside the eu in closed and protected hotspots before the first entry on the territory of the eu . 
  the eu should contribute to the financing of acceptable living conditions and security in the hotspots . 
  what outside of the eu ? 
  they were already in the eu . 
  and where do you send them ? 
   i 'm not here to campaign for him , but the mainstream media and political status quo is simply lying about him when it comes to migration orban lives in his little world where 1 million asylum seakers are not in europe .
