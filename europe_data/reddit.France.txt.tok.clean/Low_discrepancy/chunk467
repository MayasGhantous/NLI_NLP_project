   it also really hardly matters what happened 30 years later so when west germany pays the polish so they send the germans back ... good . 
  when the polish send the germans back ... bad ? 
  dude , do you not understand they were not welcome in poland !, 
  ffs germany killed 6 million jews based on rummours !, 
  how do you think polish would feel when they 'd have to share their country ** with friggin people that murdered them 3 years before ** and participated in destruction of their country . 
  ** 25 % ** participated in the ** illegal ** dismemberment of their and their polish fellow citizens country . 
  they aided the nazi army . 
  you know what happens with traitors ? 
  what 's the punishment back in the day for high treason ? 
  usually death penalty . 
  stop acting like a friggin virgin and * hurr durr * gim me justice when the germans did far far far worse and were never punished properly . 
  heck under ** current ** french law , if you participate in another army , you lose french citizenship . 
  these people should have lost their polish citizenship then and be deported out of the country ( which most likely happened ) . 
  again ** 25 % ** . 
  thats unbelievably huge . 
   my fellow countrymen not paying or avoiding the vast majority of taxes tend to be rich out-of-touch elite , not common people . 
  yeah sure . 
  i also got receipts when i went to greece  . 
   do anything that betters their condition as workers good . 
  tell your fellow countrymen to pay their taxes . 
  this will vastly improve conditions for everybody . 
   that the polish communist government encouraged the expulsion of all germans from newly annexed territory not at all . 
  west german govt also encouraged that as well . 
   people are now coming from poland at the rate 2,500 a month , largely under terms of a 1975 treaty with warsaw by which bonn provides about $ 900 million to poland in economic aid and credits . 
   it 's also up to them to choose any company which they are free to do as well  . 
  kinda odd that a greek from across the continent is telling them what to do . 
   actually no well it 's up to them to decide if they prefer unemployment to what they have now . 
   towards the german minority ** once the polish regime was stable and put in place ? 
  ** do remain in the current discussion . 
  if we start bringing into topic the russian advance etc into discussion we 'll never reach the end . 
  also the crimes committed by the russians are well recognised . 
   because they do n't have any better options . 
  so let 's not give them ** any ** options . 
  much better . 
   on top of that , one which does n't pay or treat them like shit , per secretive company policy and per exploiting labour law loopholes . 
  so they 're lining up for jobs to be exploited ? 
  wuuut ? 
  you do n't know the french very well do you ? 
   uber is perfectly able to do the firs one , at least here . 
  not in france . 
   i do n't know about your market , but here medallion transfers are legal and have to go through the state , which originally issued them . 
  that 's not the case in france . 
   enjoy being stuck 2 hours in empty taxi and uber-ridden streets and parking spots , for that `` liberty '' . 
  so you mean uber will be so successful that everybody will be a uber driver and unemployment will decrease ? 
  we must stop that . 
   i just am stating that it objectively is matching a lot of definitions of genocide/ethnic cleansing . 
   if it happened humanely or not is also another question . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  it 's the exact same question . 
  west germany started paying to get back its ethnic germans ...  the death toll certainly was way higher than what happened say in srebrenica . 
  what massacres do you care to bring to light committed towards the german minority once the polish regime was stable and put in place ? 
  german minorities committed quite a few massacres , i wonder if and what punishment they received for that . 
   their business model is built around being able to offer lower prices because of not being considered the taxis that they truly are , and also aggressively fighting anyone trying to fix the law and have them considered taxis a taxi can stop in front of the airport or train station and wait clients . 
  a taxi can pick up clients that wave them down in the middle of the street . 
  uber can not do that so they 're not taxis . 
  taxi drivers are salty because they paid ** on the black market ** hundreds of thousands for the taxi medallion . 
  when the state actually the state actually issued those medallions ** for free ** . 
  honestly , you should educate yourself between the different transportation systems before getting all pissed . 
  i will not finance the taxi black market . 
   piggying back of others ' illegal labour lel . 
  you think they 're illegals ? 
  dude i suggest you go read up what uber it , 
  well greeks are the ones that do n't pay their taxes . 
  so it 's kinda funny to see one complain about others not paying taxes . 
  well i wo n't move to greece . 
  you sound salty a bit . 
   go take a ride in the taxi it 'll relax you . 
  big society and all that . 
   you will still have a society to stand on and enjoy all your profits in . 
   why not do the same to the french collaborators https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89puration_%c3%a0_la_lib%c3%a9ration_en_france  ah so 1 out of 4 took some part in it , mind you that the definition for `` participation in the war machine '' is a very , very vague term . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksdeutscher_selbstschutz read up your own history . 
   back to collective punishment hahahaha . 
  punishment ? 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1977/06/12/germans-coming-home/206480eb-4c71-4408-b390-b0177bd6f51e/  people are now coming from poland at the rate 2,500 a month , largely under terms of a 1975 treaty with warsaw by which bonn provides about $ 900 million to poland in economic aid and credits . 
  by 1960s , west germany was paying to get back its ethnic germans and they were leaving skipping . 
  how do you think people herta muller ended up living in germany ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herta_m%c3%bcller leaving the communist block for west germany . 
  god what a punishment . 
  poland should pay reparations !, 
   not that i 'm particularly familiar with the episode . 
  it 's right next with the 25 % of germans in poland that participated in the nazi war machine and did n't go to any jail . 
  one in four . 
  how many killed innocent poles without going to war ? 
  i wo n't cry too hard at night for these people . 
  25 % of germans living in poland participated in the nazi war machine . 
  did they go to jail once they arrived in germany ? 
   sounds like ethnic cleansing . 
  someone should define to you `` humane '' , 
   that 's completely irrelevant with regards to whether it 's genocide or not . 
  they were humanely displaced from a region where they were no longer welcome . 
  no massive massacres like they were involved in just a few years before . 
   also completely irrelevant . 
  justice was not served fully during ww2 so it 's ridiculous to see / u/vertikal19 demand justice . 
  exactly !, 
  so one should profit now . 
   well , i for example avoid the term . 
  color me shocked . 
   of course , but that does not change that what is seen as a genocide is a poltiical decision how do you define a heap of sand ? 
   yet nobody would speak of it as genocide you mean for these people ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksdeutscher_selbstschutz  it is estimated that 25 % of the german minority in poland were members of these organisations .
