  the german minority participated heavily in the oppression of poles , in massacring poles etc. 
  it is only normal they were no longer welcome in poland after the war . 
  the same goes for the pieds noirs which were no longer welcome in algeria . 
  i mean the other option was arresting ** all ** the germans that were involved in the illegal war ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide_definitions  any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : killing members of the group ; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life , calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; [ and ] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . 
  ( article 2 cppcg ) here ya go buddy . 
  do n't get salty that bosnian serbs committed genocide . 
   it simply was not far reaching at least in my oppinion , it could never have achieved a destruction of the ethnic group of bosniak muslims . 
  genocide does n't just imply mass murder . 
   only military age men were targeted . 
  [ those 14 yo military aged men doe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre#separation_and_murder_of_bosniak_men_and_boys_in_poto.c4.8dari ) . 
  and the rape too . 
  let 's not forget the rape . 
   if it really comes to that we should have some politicians exiled on disease ridden islands in the pacific for their incompetence . 
  politicians are just implementing what the people think they want . 
  soon we 'll run out of levels of alert . 
  the suupa duupa high level of alert ? 
  i celebrated by ordering an uber because public transportation is n't working and i 'm not dumb enough to pay 2x on taxis . 
  long live the worker , 
  the only serbian i know is convinced that it 's wrong to call srebrenica \u00e0 g\u00e9nocide , but a war crime . 
  why ? 
  apparently because genocides are done by bad people while everyone does war crimes . 
   the reason why nobody says specifically what is wrong is because the difference between the real severity of the issues of the eu , and the severity which people talk about is massive and is greatly inflated by hot air coming from politicians and the media trying to grab whatever attention they can . 
  wow , you must be super sheltered to think that the eu does n't have any problems . 
  from posted workers to the massive inequalities in the fiscal and social systems that see companies set up fronts in netherlands , luxembourg , ireland and paying ridiculously low levels of taxes , to the east where workers there are sometimes treated like shit . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39196056 for ridiculously low pay . 
  the eurozone 's huge problems where no-one seems to want to join it anymore . 
  not romania not poland . 
  the solution to the refugee problem that was once again ridiculous . 
  the intelligence gap in fighting terrorism that sees terrorist attacks planned in one eu country with guns acquired from a second eu country to attack a third eu country . 
  terrorist that commit an attack and are caught after crossing 3-4 countries . 
  there are things to solve and if they are not tackled , in 2022 the two candidates will be * 1 ) meluche that wants a complete modification of the eu or a frexit . 
  * 2 ) le pen that wants another unreasonable modification of the eu or frexit . 
   but stupid people will buy stupid shit . 
  they probably do n't trust chinese authorities . 
  read the baby food scandal . 
   so any tariffs will hit any country ( or businesses within ) harder than the uk just because of that . 
  if uk really wants to pay more for goods , why do n't they raise taxes then ? 
  [ two ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whhk7l9by6a&amp;t=6m53s ) relevant [ sketches ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5j0s2mc5be&amp;t=14m37s ), 
   so how did op cause faschists to do this ? 
    you know , you can be sorry something happened without causing it ? 
  like : `` oh it 's shitty that happened ! '' . 
   what do you think that is ? 
  people from a country that was ravaged by fascists and communists not supporting either ideology ? 
  some 47 % of people who voted hollande in 2012 , voted for macron . 
  sure people do n't like hollande , but they 're centrists , economic and societal liberals . 
  my bad . 
  i looked at the `` last election '' in wiki . 
   why are you ashamed for the choices of others ? 
  because choices are not developped in a void . 
  they 're influenced by society , people around us , by the failures of the education system , parenting etc. 
  op probably regrets the several failures that had to lead to this . 
  they 're holding flags in the hopes they look less dumb and more numerous . 
  did n't really work . 
  if it helps , they 're not active for your own interest , but for the interest of banks . 
   why ? 
  it should be obvious ... no it is not obvious because you state bs emotional reasons but not ** political ** reasons why non uk people should favour lab vs cons . 
  politics is done with ... political arguments . 
  and i suggest you should not take sides in debates where you voice does not count because you might be seen as interfering in other people 's business . 
   they do , however , wish for the united kingdom to participate in the customs union . 
  i fail to see how that is possible . 
  only eu countries ( plus monaco , you know ) are in the eu customs union . 
  not even non-eu eea countries are part of it . 
  wanting to be out of the eu and in the eu customs union is again a ridiculous demand . 
  out is out . 
  in is in . 
   but obviously , brexit blew some sand in your cracks . 
  i simply do n't care who wins their elections . 
  i 'm french i got french elections . 
  germans have german elections . 
  foreign people should just acknowledge the elections in other countries , get informed if so they wish and not express any desire for one candidate or the other . 
   you are asking a kids question '' why care about politics '' . 
  again you refuse to understand the point raised here . 
  it is a question ; ** why care about labour v torry ** i 'll end it here . 
  cheers . 
   i live here you idiot first learn not to insult . 
   domestic politics still affects me . 
  you are in the uk because of their generosity in letting them open their country to you . 
  if they decide to stop those priviledges , it is up to them and them solely to decide and no foreigner should intervene in their internal affairs . 
  it is a discussion between the british . 
  if you want to have your say , get citizenship . 
   wipe that iraqi blood off your tuxedo yeah i 'm sure conservatives were against the iraq war . 
   even if that were true https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/24/labour-vows-to-rip-up-and-rethink-brexit-white-paper it is true . 
    there are other issues to consider than just brexit yes internal reasons . 
  no foreign citizen should give a shit about the internal affairs of another country . 
   replace it with new negotiating priorities with the emphasis on ** keeping the benefits of the single market and customs union ** . 
  in a speech on tuesday keir starmer keir starmer ** the same guy ** that said this :  `` ** we recognise that immigration rules will have to change as we exit the eu ** , but we do not believe that immigration should be the overarching priority , '' he said . 
  emphasis mine . 
  are you people for real ? 
  you can not have single market and restrict immigration . 
  again read to the umpteenth article about merkel saying once again : you do n't cherry pick conditions . 
   if you do n't care , holy shit dude read what i am writing . 
  the question : ** why care about labour vs torry ? 
  ** this is n't about caring about politics but about ** why ** should you care for one vs the other . 
  they both want hard brexit so it 's the same shit for any european . 
  both labour and torries want a hard brexit . 
  so why would you care for one vs the other . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/24/labour-vows-to-rip-up-and-rethink-brexit-white-paper labour has n't signalled shit . 
  they want to end freedom of immigration meaning they want hard brexit . 
  that does n't answer my question at all .
