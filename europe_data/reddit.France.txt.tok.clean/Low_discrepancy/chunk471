   n anti-war painting inspired by the horrors he witnessed in gernika . 
  he did n't witness it . 
  he just read it in a paper . 
  he never returned to spain since 1934 . 
  so red berets were not serbian ? 
  see how you can present the full context then . 
  a brake on air strikes was agreed by us-fr-uk because there were 300 french and british soldiers were held as prisoners . 
  and from your source :  seasoned diplomats insist the massacre came as a surprise . 
  the us assistant secretary for human rights , john shattuck , said : `` we had the omarska model in mind '' -- ergo , that mladic would imprison men in camps , for use as `` an extremely valuable bargaining counter to gain territorial exchange or even political concessions '' as richard butler -- the us intelligence officer who worked as the srebrenica military expert at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -- put it . 
   a us briefing paper on srebrenica reads : `` we did not have any information on any bosnian serb intent to commit atrocities against the muslim defenders or population of srebrenica . '' hindsight is 20/20 though . 
   if anyone is to blame it 's france for making a secret deal with serbia . 
  sauce . 
  to cover up statues when they come here , but also cover ourselves up when we go there is ridiculous to me . 
  the rules in europe are the rules in europe.thr rules out there are the rules out there . 
  she assumed she did n't need to wear a veil and did n't bother to ask . 
  well if religious authorities bother you , how about not going to see them ? 
  in vatican there 's a dress code . 
   it after an explicit prior agreement she would n't have to .

  it makes it seem that her team assumed she 'd be let in without a veil because in egypt their religious authority let her without one . 
  http://www.europe1.fr/international/le-pen-refuse-de-porter-le-voile-pour-rencontrer-le-grand-mufti-a-beyrouth-2983868 she fucked up then she tried to play the look at me i 'm such an independent card . 
  [ do n't lie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojbr5p4ycmm&amp;t=15m46s ), 
  it 's a stupid poll . 
  australia is 13th but co2 per capita is one of the highest actually . 
  they had ** three ** chips in the race . 
  at one point 2 of them were poised to go to the second round . 
  imagine how salty they must be now . 
  honestly , who here never had a crush on any of their teachers or professors ? 
   i just imagine one must be rich to live in monaco . 
  you still need cooks , waiters etc even in monaco . 
  and up until recently monaco was n't that rich . 
  i am disappointed . 
  i was told by all the french people that ca n't wait to give hj to putin that ukraine is being run by neo-nazis . 
   i can describe reasons for 100 year war no need to go that back far into history . 
  you just need to go to de gaulle and his saying no to uk in the eec * twice * . 
  and concerning eu business , france and germany always felt drawn back by uk . 
   everyone is in the army in switzerland/austria is every male in switzerland/austria getting paid by the army now ? 
  then the ones not getting paid are civilians . 
   on this sub it would be better to be a russian or chinese . 
  have you actually been more that 3 minutes on / r/europe . 
  any russian that does n't quickly start shitting on their own country gets downvoted . 
   same goes for uk btw , from the best buds of france and germany best buds ? 
  you do n't really know french or british history do you ? 
   rifles for service are exluded , so do i commit a crime when i shoot it at a civilian range but its totaly fine when i shoot it at an army range ? 
  by that logic : so it 's fine if the army has nukes but when i try to gather up some uranium suddenly i 'm a baddie ? 
  yes you 're allowed to do certain things at work that you might not be allowed at home . 
  how 's that a surprise ? 
   there is clearly a problem with enforcing the existing rules . 
  again , ** no ** . 
  it is well known that slovakia had shitty deactivation rules . 
   ak47s are n't any less legal now than they were before this ak47s are legal if you have the correct licence . 
  and instead of carrying 30 bullets they 'll have to carry 20 . 
  omg no !, 
   that has n't stopped paris from seeing them used on their streets several times . 
   the guns used in the jihadi attacks recently were manufactured in russia and never legal in the eu . 
  let 's not talk shit . 
  https://www.wsj.com/articles/slovakia-shop-believed-to-be-source-of-guns-in-two-french-terror-attacks-1448629216 the guns were deactivated by slovakians but they could easily be reactivated . 
  the fault is with slovakians . 
   the big problem is n't with the regulations , but with the enforcement of them . 
  & nbsp ;  i mean , do you think the ak47s used in paris were actually because the legislation was poor . 
   though most weapons used by terrorist are illegal . 
  they were bought as decommisioned weapons that were n't properly decomissioned . 
   by the time the deactivation process for slovenian guns is fixed , terrorists wo n't care . 
  darn you 're an expert right ? 
   ( also very caucasian ) omfg you got stopped even though you 're white ? 
  where is the world coming to ? 
  welp . 
  i guess we 're the new czech republic !, 
  it 's yuge . 
  big if true . 
  biggly . 
   noooo ... communism will . 
  between communism and prayin to the gods of the free market , surely there 's some middle ground . 
  surely, 
  i am entertained by this thread alone !, 
   order as in orders . 
  command . 
  dude stfu . 
  it 's not your battle to fight . 
   a capitalist country is the result of individual failure or cronyism do n't be ridiculous . 
  it 's the fault of big government and the fact that free market was n't free enough . 
  because free market will totally solve global warming . 
   le pen won the vote in nice . 
  for some reason i had pegged it as a progressive city hahaha ... hahahaha ... haaaa, 
  so largest numbers in paris and lyon where le pen got 5 % and 14 % . 
  very interesting . 
   but paris makes a huge bulge into the middle you like our big bulge  ? 
   if le pen wants any chance of winning she needs to obtain more votes . 
  no shit sherlock .

   [ the element of surprise , even if it is feigned , plays the same role of accommodating dissonance in accepting a diamond gift as it does in prime sexual seductions : it permits the woman to pretend that she has not actively participated in the decision . 
  she thus retains both her innocence -- and the diamond .

  totes !, 
   but apparently people living in a departement with more than 30 mosques seem to disagree . 
  did you talk to any or is it all in your mind ? 
  macron is n't ps . 
   ( all the indicators show he wo n't ) so changing flairs does not make one more informed . 
  we 're doing science here people !, 
   even if they are french they 're french .
