  on derrida https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sokal_affair on foucault , the fact that chomsky says it beautifully . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63_kaw3wme but i really particularly love chomsky 's analysis ( read demolition ) of french intellectualism and postmodernism https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cqte_bph7m tl : dr : they 're the original circlejerkers . 
  except chile . 
  if they wanted to discredit foucault and derrida , they 'd just need to publish their works . 
  unless you 're good looking . 
  he 'll lose calories crying then . 
  maybe the tears will fall on the cake , making it salty and uneatable . 
  you read the news . 
  the swedes need to eat less . 
  good . 
  maybe you 'll eat less cake !, 
  because the terrorists are weak and we 're strong . 
  no longer do we have bataclans . 
  we just have one retard with a gun or a car . 
  go back to t_d troll !, 
  one by one by one . 
  we 'll chip slowly but surely on the terrorists . 
  vive la france . 
   tired after work , do n't walk the dog as often & nbsp ;  50-100 calorie surplus suddently becomes a 300-500 + calorie supluss walking does n't really burn off calories that much . 
  if you have a 150 surplus calorie diet , you need to walk 30 mins . 
  that shit adds up . 
  if you have a 300cal surplus diet , you 'd have to walk 1h to burn it off . 
  or you know ... avoid to eat that snickers bar . 
  the recommended amount of sport is at least [ 150 min of moderate physical activity every week ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm ) . 
  let 's say 250 mins ( 250/7 = 35 mins ) . 
  this burns about [ 250 cals for your usual activity ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/physical_activity/#howmany ) . 
  so if you have a diet that is 300-500 + cals per day , you 'll have an excess of 50-250 + cals per day . 
  you * will * gain weight even if you do sports if your caloric surplus is excessive . 
  and just to see how easy it is to hit a 450 cal surplus ; 450 cals = one can of coke and one snickers bar . 
  le drian really effed up hamon . 
   those stats are surprising considering i rarely see obese people out and about . 
  [ tofi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tofi ) ... yes i hangout on / r/documentaries, 
   they stopped moving if you wan na lose weight you got ta watch what you eat . 
  sports is only a second order effect . 
   north korea definitely has nukes maybe that 's why it 's a bad idea to launch an attack ? 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af  iran has been similarly persuaded to abandon their nuke program . 
  so persuasion works and there 's no need to invade ? 
  who knew ... 
   hahaha working hard is n't necessarily a bad thing , if you lot manned up and worked a bit harder you might get richer !, 
  have you actually seen french weather and french cuisine ? 
  cuz i 've seen british weather and british cuisine . 
  i 'd work hard and long if i were you too . 
   nah i 'm just fucking with you man , you 're alright for a frenchie only time when brits are sentimental is when they 're plastered . 
  dude weekend is in 2 days . 
  yeah we were told the same thing about iraq and now about iran ... do n't you people kinda get tired of war ? 
  it 's not like it 's been incredibly successful so far . 
   but also 2 million less people , that 's just 0.3 % difference lel . 
  dude do n't waste your break on tea and reddit . 
  work needs to be done . 
  by the end of the year you 'll have worked 13 % more than i do for just 6 % of the money , 
  http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp.php only 6 % richer . 
  ( and that without going into ppp , you 'd be very upset ) . 
  but you work 13 % more . 
  dude . 
  stop hanging out on reddit and go back to work . 
  neah . 
  we 're about as rich . 
  ** but ** you work 200 hours more than us per year . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_time so in essence you have to work much more than a frenchman to be as rich as a frenchman . 
  that sucks does n't it ? 
   the us is much much larger than the uk . 
  * pop us / pop uk = 5 . 
  * pop uk/pop switzerland = 8 . 
  uk is far more larger than switzerland than the us is larger compared to uk . 
  us is much more farther than uk and also french do n't have a greencard so much more difficult to find jobs compared to uk . 
  spoken like a true american . 
  there are french that actually speak without a heavy accent . 
  and there are far more french speakers than speak a different language than english that speak a different one . 
  oh do n't worry . 
  english speakers maintain a heavy accent no matter the language . 
  gg / r/europe . 
  always making it about migrants for some reason . 
  is that a freudian thing for you ? 
   actually having a land border helps having a land border only helps in the sense that 90k people live in france and [ work in switzerland . 
  ] ( https://www.challenges.fr/economie/le-nombre-de-frontaliers-en-suisse-a-double-en-10-ans_17950 ) which would n't appear in your statistic . 
  here 's a stat from 2015 http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/le-scan-eco/decryptage/2016/03/16/29002-20160316artfig00006-expatriation-les-pays-preferes-des-francais.php there are more french in switzerland and the us than there are in uk ( which has about the same numbers as germany ) . 
   yeah , the irish government wants the uk to keep on with this . 
  i do not doubt such a thing for an instant . 
  not many former french colonies want to cut ties with france either . 
  it 's only normal . 
   news at 11 : poor people and i 'll come back to the ethernal / r/europe comment you see when articles like this are published : `` hurr durr that 's just relative poverty , it does n't mean these people do n't have enough food to put on the table . 
  it is n't real poverty '' . 
  well now we get to see once more why relative poverty is n't a good thing . 
   and by the same token it is a strong destination for people from non-english speaking countries yes of course . 
  citizens from india or pakistan will always be far more willing to come to uk than any other eu country . 
  those are pre-existing to the accession to the eu . 
  of course countries once subjugated by uk still get to feel some of its subjugation . 
  we do that with monaco too . 
  there are more in switzerland . 
   we just had someone become a perpetual dictator by popular vote who ? 
   some people are simply wrong , and they occasionally get a majority well you get to be wrong with them . 
  but as a general principle having the prosecutors named independently from the executive branch and maybe even from the legislative branch is a good thing . 
   but so do the other guys . 
  damn those people than do n't vote like you do !, 
   i agree with you that you do n't need to be in the eu to be an attractive destination , of course not . 
  but between non-eu destinations us is much more attractive than uk . 
  the diversity of the country ( people , geography , etc ) and the high level of earning makes it much better ... again look at the levels of productivity . 
  australia is quite nice because it is simply a spectacular continent . 
  uk is particularly attractive for people doing finance and want to remain in europe ... but honestly with the low pound , high rents in london and perspectives of interesting jobs in frankfurt , paris ... 
  i dunno ... sure frankfurt is n't london ... but have you seen the prices ?
