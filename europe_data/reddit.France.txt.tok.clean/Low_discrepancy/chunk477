  i think war in eastern ukraine is the major block in business , not the sanctions . 
  yes . 
  he also wants to sanction poland and hungary for not accepting refugees and reforming schengen and frontex . 
  i do n't know what the reforms will imply though . 
   however it does n't mean he is pro-putin and it 's important to highlight it . 
  he has not expressed any disagreeing view about the geopolitical actions russia has undertaken in the last decade . 
  he most notably calls the sanctions on russia illegal and wants to remove them `` to help the ukrainians '' . 
  http://europe.jean-luc-melenchon.fr/2015/04/13/les-sanctions-anti-russes-sont-illegales/ even though the president of ukraine wants sanctions to remain !, 
   however it 's not against the german people but the politics of germany and merkel has a very high approval rating amongst the germans !, 
   m\u00e9lenchon is hardly anti german and pro russian well let 's just put it this way , he 's against almost anything germany stands for from an economic stand point , and he 's in favour of almost every geopolitical action russia undertook . 
  also , he wants to remove '' ** the illegal sanctions on russia ** '' . 
  http://europe.jean-luc-melenchon.fr/2015/04/13/les-sanctions-anti-russes-sont-illegales/ one of his arguments is that he wants to ** remove sanctions in order to help ukraine ** . 
  so ... at what point do we separate as much as possible from turkey ? 
  frankly , i 'd say evet to that . 
   there 's nothing wrong with having high concentrations of immigrants or minorities , but integration never became a priority yes i 'm sure other countries excelled at integration . 
  like how americans succeeded at integrating black and hispanic minorities or canadians at integrating native americans . 
   managed to insulate themselves from anything belgian yeah that tends to happen when a larger group . 
  you either let in a few trickle and after those are integrated you let another small group and so on and so forth . 
   for turks , the usa and canada resolved it by not taking many to begin with different countries with different needs and different resources and different distances from the country of origin of immigrants . 
  i fail to see why we 're comparing apples and orangers . 
  it 's irrelevant . 
  i 'm quite happy that fewer than 50 % of turkish in western europe went to vote . 
   spanish turks spain has 3000 turks . 
  that 's a ridiculously low number . 
  belgium has ** 45 times ** more turks . 
   there are very few turks in countries like uae canada has 25k turks . 
  so 5 times the number of turks even though has 1/3rd of the population of canada . 
   if you can but do n't vote , your opinion does n't count , and should n't be taken into account . 
  exactly . 
  people not living in turkey do n't care a great deal about turkey . 
  big surprise . 
  turnout does n't take into account underage people . 
  only people that can vote . 
   last year 's usa election , for example , had that turnout . 
  us elections are typically very low turnout . 
  french elections hit 80 , german elections hit 70 + , the turkish ref was 85 % in turkey . 
  and 55 % is for belgium . 
  for france and germany it was 45 % . 
  that 's a very low turnout . 
  if you live in another country , you do n't care significantly less about your home country . 
  the fact that so few european turks actually went to vote is a good thing imo . 
   it is more important to put the money made from exports to good use . 
  so infrastructure spending is n't good use ? 
   it is still nationalist rhetoric , especially since he does n't really specify what should change , and how . 
  well is n't kinda obvious ? 
  germany should start spending massively on infrastructure in order to increase interior demand aka stop penny pinching and start spending a bit which will increase your imports  the ecb is not controlled by germany . 
  what 's that got to do with anything ? 
   and you ca n't complain . 
  they 're not complaining though . 
  they live in another country . 
   said lot of times that he is a comedian and nothing else . 
  yes , but he 's from the school of jon stewart who also liked to say that he 's just a comedian but always commented on serious shit and started to be considered more trustworthy than news organisations . 
  [ so i was n't wrong , was i ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65qsib/someone_corrected_erdogans_title_on_wikipedia/dgcitb9/ ), 
   he needs to use a bit of nationalist rhetoric to stop the rise of m\u00e9lenchon . 
  what nationalist rhetoric ? 
  he 's simply not wrong . 
   it is not germany 's fault if other countries are incompetent . 
  you do n't know how economy works , do you ? 
   but we would like them to experience what they have chosen for us when they only come to turkey let 's put it this way . 
  60 % of the votes from france were yes , but only 45 % of people votes . 
  that means that just 25 % of turks living in france voted yes . 
  compare that to the fact that 45 % of turks living in turkey votes yes . 
  it 's your own fuck up . 
   apparently 77 % of `` belgian turks '' voted yes . 
  https://www.dailysabah.com/election/turkey-2017-referendum/belgium-referendum-results 75 % of 55 % voted yes . 
  so about 41 % of belgian turks votes ` yes ' . 
  ** 59 % ** of belgian turks voted no or did n't care to go voting . 
  [ `` numbers are fragile beings , and by getting tortued , they 'll confess to anything you want them to '' ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_sauvy#citations ), 
   making rather obscure topics palatable to general audience those obscure topics usually regard us stuff . 
  and almost always , he takes one phrase pronounced and shits all over the person * because of that phrase * . 
  when it 's an obscure topic , ok sure , i guess it 's comic relief , but when it 's a really important one , it 's kinda dumb . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_xsiffbxpu here 's him shitting on norway , because the norwegian immigration minister said that `` jesus wanted to help as many people as possible , not as many people as possible in norway '' . 
  and he begins his dumb stupid joke rant on something that is essentially a good message . 
  with 10k euros , you wo n't house one migrant in norway while in jordan , you can help so many more people . 
  in fact , norway * spends the most per capita on international aid * , but he conveniently forgets to mention that . 
  his bias that shows on stuff you kinda know taints any commentary he has on stuff you have no clue about . 
  tl ; dr : he 's extremely selective so consider that when watching his vids , he 's just a comedian . 
  almost all of the western countries had a participation rate of under 50 % , usually actually half the rate seen in turkey : 85 % . 
  in reality , the majority of turkish expats didnt give a shit about the referendum . 
  instead of witchhunts abroad , check the problems inside turkey . 
   i agree nobody eats nails , wait ? 
  what do you eat on good friday : o, 
   each top four instead of being a `` anything but le pen '' piece with topics that one tends to know , john oliver is extremely fluff, 
  i think that 's for those that went the evet way . 
  this looks like what i imagine the jolly rancher story is . 
  we already have footage of [ turkish celebrating ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnttb1ofumc ), 
   eli5 what this does for turkey you know how after you guys voted to leave the eu , we used to say you 're leaving europe ? 
  well this is actually accurate for turkey . 
  democracy will be the thing you 'll get when you take a plane somewhere else, 
  but lost the war . 
  some sprinkled some salt in brazil . 
  this and hide the pain harold . 
  who knew so many memes come from south east europe ? 
   but the eu itself still has a revolving door problem and is still quite amenable to corrupt corporate influences . 
  well eerybody has a price . 
  the eu 's price would just be higher . 
   i actually read this thread about her this morning and she passes away on the same day now we know what killed her :|,
