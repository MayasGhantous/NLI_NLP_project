   80 is octante in swiss no , no it 's not . 
   but have no representatio this is something you must be very proud of . 
   it is also hard to deny that some countries might object having a muslim country ( say , bosnia ) i bosnia can not be in the union because bosnia is not a full country and has severe issues . 
   they do n't have a national language , but hawaiian language and culture were repressed prior statehood . 
  not to mention that native population was replaced with white settlers . 
  so because americans did n't do awful things in puerto rico it can not be a state ? 
   a multi-cultural country to a multi-national one , and many congressmen are not happy with the idea . 
  how about the indians and their sovereign nations ? 
   , if you want to become an `` american '' they 're already `` american '' . 
   but christianity has slowly been kicked out of politics for the most part . 
  good so their religion should n't matter one bit . 
   and speaks spanish by a large margin so ? 
  it 's not like you have a national language . 
   because it is majority catholic is n't the us secular ? 
   working on reducing their population in eu is pretty sensible . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  some people are way too ignorant . 
  do you understand the concept of a secular state ? 
  get ready to be surprised germany !, 
  now i 'm wondering if i 've seen boards like this one written in english , in france . 
  doubt it . 
   the vast majority of christian countries do not persecute gays . 
  that 's a recent phenomenon and only * because we removed christianity * . 
  60-70 years ago it would have sucked to be gay in uk for example . 
  alan turing anyone ? 
   and a free day go to work , ye lazy german !, 
  so in islam they put black tarps on their wives , in ireland they put it on their alcohol ? 
   tee total vegetarian i bet he tells everyone about the virtues of going on a vegan diet . 
   no presidential candidate , however popular , should be beyond the reaches of the legal system yeah but during the official campaign that started on the 10th of april ... meh ... 
  i want her locked up as much as anyone else , but still ... 
   joined a far-right political party which did not get enough votes to enter parliament . 
  now i know where fillon got his strategy from . 
  go to the extreme right and try to get immunity !, 
   de l' u.r.s.s. 
   instead , the argument goes , the eu gave way to the rhetoric of the likes of france 's nicolas sarkozy , who called turkish membership `` unthinkable '' . 
  the little hungarian did one or two things correctly . 
  i 'd say this is more proper . 
  [ l'origine du monde ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%27origine_du_monde ) . 
  ps : do n't click on this wiki link if you 're a prude ... 
  i got banned before for posting this art . 
  you gave one back !, 
  how about all the rest ? 
  just a few in rome . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_obelisks_in_rome you put a friggin cross on it [ even ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_obelisks_in_rome#/media/file:obelisk-lateran.jpg ) . 
  geesh . 
   there is no other language for your first link . 
  :( it 's italian dude . 
  we can figure out the main points . 
   t 's very popular in russia to view russian culture as superior to other , especially american culture . 
  especially popular among lower class people , who are not cultured themselves , but always babble about `` but our opera , our ballet , our dostoyevski !!! '' . 
  i heard from a few indians that this attitude is also prevalent in india , so maybe it 's a defense mechanism for `` great '' but poor nations . 
  every country has it . 
  french , brits , germans , italians , somewhat the spanish , americans and their exceptionalism . 
   they supported anti-colonial and liberation struggles oh really ? 
  i have n't read his letter praising the people of timisoara and bucharest for fighting off communism . 
  can you send a link to me ? 
   the ussr was rather cautious about foreign interventions * korean war * hungarian revolution * czechoslovakian revolution * afghanistan war * financing international terror groups like rfa , plo , italian marxists . 
  ( kinda `` amazing '' how there 's almost no left wing terrorist attacks in europe since the 1990s ) now now , i do n't want a list of `` whatabout the usaaaaa '' . 
  i am just critiquing the image that the ussr is non interventionist . 
  brezhnev 's policy was that any country in the communst block that even thinks about dropping communism will be invaded . 
  i got worried a bit for leaving the eu but it 's nice to see we 'll join another even stronger economic powerhouse, 
  what the article is saying is that there 's less international cooperation than before . 
  and there 's no reason for that to happen . 
  all conditions for scientists in poland are better than 20 years ago . 
   the people i 'm working with are not in this for the money . 
  but they want to have more in life than live below the poverty line . 
  it 's not like in poland 20 years ago scientists were living the highlife . 
  again you 're comparing a scientist in poland vs one in germany . 
  the article is comparing one in poland now vs one in poland 20 years ago . 
  do you not see how these are two different issues ? 
  there 's no shame in wanting to live a better life . 
   it 's curious that the article does n't mention salary or , you know , getting a job to begin with . 
  well presumably conditions in ee did n't * worsen * . 
  is it harder to get a job in poland in science compared to 20 years ago ? 
  i doubt it . 
  is the salary smaller ? 
  i also doubt that too . 
  it 's just that they have the option of making x in poland or 2x/3x/4x in germany . 
  a choice is quickly made , in such a context . 
  barrel bombs are not cluster bombs . 
  but you include arthaud which is crazy ... okaaaay ... 
  yeah if we ignore what we do n't like , we only get what we like . 
  hardly new idea , but not terribly useful ... 
  18.5 +8.5 +1.5 +0.5 = 29 % ump+fn+nda = 19 +24 +3.5 = 46.5 % macron 23 % considered center . 
  there ya go a minorty . 
   it would have been interesting to see just how crazy shit could get . 
  hey . 
  he could always transform into the next dubya . 
  do n't lose faith, 
  ee can breathe a sigh of relax for the next 20 minutes . 
  ** thank you !, 
  ** i 'm tired of this rhetoric about how meluche is really really for a new eu . 
  nope . 
  he made the demands explicitly to fail ( by asking all the german big no no 's ) . 
  germany will have to jump through hoops every time we 're bothered about something . 
  the whole process is made so as to used a cameron like strategy . 
  make france seem weak in the eu in the eyes of french voters so as to push for a frexit . 
  like i said it time and time again , he does n't define what successful negociations are , he does n't understand that the new eu needs to pass through all national ( and some regional ) parlaments . 
   like remove hamon , poutou , arthaud and consorts what consorts ? 
  the main small candidate nda is extreme right .
