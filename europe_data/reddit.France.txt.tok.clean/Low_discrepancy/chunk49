  or having 75 % of your energy from nuclear rather than 50 % from coal . 
  if you remove france , nothing would change . 
  if you remove germany , the average would decrease , yes . 
  why ? 
  france is exactly in the world average in terms of co2 emissions per capita . 
   they 're still only 77 % of kyoto level emissions . 
  if only the world did that ... huh ? 
  if the world polluted to the levels of germany , we 'd be in a dark dark coughy place . 
  i believe it is . 
  germany is the highest polluter per capita in the eu in terms of co2 emissions . 
  that 's serious man . 
   if they got their way there would have been investment in the alternatives much soone if its and buts were candy and nuts ... 
   yeah you probably still buy clothes produced in bangladeshi slave factories that burn down with half of the employees inside once in a while . 
  or smartphones that contain metal from mines with a substantial worker throughput . 
  irrelevant whataboutism that i 'll ignore . 
   but the point stands : nuclear power isnt economically viable without subsidies . 
  same for coal . 
  we simply do not even try to measure how much harm it does . 
   but the new german coal plants are much better than the european average that is used by the site you linked . 
  co2 emissions per country . 
  france is 2.3 times less in total emissions and 1.8 less per capita . 
  germany is the ** worst ** co2 polluter in the eu in both statistics . 
   #worst case nuclear accident costs a you forgot the first part , did n't you  how about the ** normal ** scenario of coal burning . 
  http://www.coal-is-dirty.com/the-coal-hard-facts 22000 ** premature deaths ** in europe alone . 
  yes the eco nuts saved us . 
   economically unsustainable turning off a perfectly functional plant because of crazies is economically unsustainable . 
   the need the store the waste safely for thousands of years . 
  yes . 
  a thousand cubic meters of waste for thousands of years . 
  surely an impossible task . 
  we can not build a 10 by 10 by 10 m safe storing unit . 
  but that co2 emitted in the atmosphere , that will surely be absorbed immediatly . 
   i fing interesting that environmentalists fight against i dude , ecologists are dumb . 
  look at germany . 
  they were fighting nuclear and now germany is one of the top eu countries by co2 emission . 
  maybe they 're building a triangular spaceship for all the poles . 
  so according to / u/roxven89 centre-rght = left ? 
  okay ... what 's extreme left i wonder ? 
  it looks like a snake shedding its skin . 
  that l'oreal aging cream really does wonders . 
   are ideologically left choosen by previous left governemnt was the previous govt really a left one ? 
  but that 's sarkozy . 
   the problem is that the french never sign up when the going gets tough . 
  you mean the whole iraq wmd thing ? 
  neah dude , we 're simply not stupid to go in pointless wars . 
  and by what amount ? 
  condoms are at 18 % . 
  withdrawal at 22 % . 
  while the pill is like at 3 % . 
  did you read the rest of the article ? 
   pills are not really good for all women . 
  there a ton of other non-pill based methods . 
  copper rods etc. 
  / u/unclesneakyfingers and / u/andy18cruz too . 
  did i miss some important stats that came out recently ? 
  the effectiveness off condoms vs pulling out are well about the same irl conditions . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/birth_control http://mobile.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/health/21cond.html?referer=&amp;_r=0 the reason why withdrawal is not really recommended is because well : the chick kinda counts on the dude to do the work . 
  `` trust me honey , i know what i 'm doin ' '' just use the pill , people . 
  is 82 % really pretty close to 100 % ? 
  how about 78 % ? 
  those are the rates for condom use and for withdrawal . 
  how do you define better ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birth_control 22 % vs 18 % is n't exactly a game changer . 
  use the pill man . 
   do n't they have basic sex ed in serbia ? 
  pulling out is way risky . 
  it 's just as risky as a condom in real life . 
   but it 's probably mostly because of the belief that pulling out works almost as good . 
  pulling out is almost as good in real test use . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birth_control but well , you got ta remember to do it . 
  i do n't really think you can qualify germany as a success story if twice is impressive . 
  http://www.inegalites.fr/spip.php?article86 17 % of immigrants are unemployed vs 9 % of people born in france . 
  it 's mostly due to degrees . 
  45 % of foreigners have at most a 10 year education vs 25 % of french . 
   does this mean our foreigners are noticeably less criminal like the french , brit and italian foreigners ? 
  what 's the foreigner incarceration rate in france ? 
  it 's not on his graph . 
   not very good at math , eh ? 
  :d   2x 39,000 = 78,000 the sector that fell had 2.7 times as many bulgarians . 
  it 's in the link i sent   otherwise if we 'd just be throwing nationalist banter at each other by diverting the topic to the whole war or even other wars , i do n't really see the point . 
  okay let 's boil down the facts . 
  romania sent the 1st and 2nd army up north ( about 400k soldiers ) . 
  only the 3rd army remained to protect the southern front . 
  the army was overstretched . 
  that is a reality , like it or not . 
  claiming that the fact that they had to face two enemies and the were flanked had no outcome on the result is a bit unhistoric . 
  the battle is part of a war and you can not focus on one element without considering the rest . 
  if you want , you can consider the same war and talk about the vardar offensive . 
  while the bulgarians held doiran , the dobro pole front completely fell . 
  the doiran defenders had to leave the position and that was it , they lost . 
  this is a case where attacking on multiple fronts over streches the capabilities and they finaly lost . 
  one has to consider a larger view to see why things happen the way they do . 
  that being said , my main point is war propaganda . 
  just as you mention only the victorious moments of the bulgarian army and ridicule the opponents while ignoring less grandious moments and losses , the same goes for your opponent . 
  romanians usually talk about how they kept 1 million central powers stuck for a few months , hopeless in moldova but they had to quit since russia left the war . 
  propaganda is propaganda . 
  of course people will glorify their victories and minimise their loses . 
  you create silly unfactual saying about your opponent , etc. 
  i am surprised you think you are immune to that . 
   usually in history it would take 2-3 times more attackers to take a stronghold good , cuz there were about 2 times as many bulgarians  .
