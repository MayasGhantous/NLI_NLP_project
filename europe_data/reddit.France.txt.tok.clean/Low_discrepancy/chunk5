  seems like obama and trump are using europe in order to score cheap political points . 
  france spends 1.8 % and we still needed some help . 
   we have a much bigger incentive to punish them for that than the usa does . 
  we also have much bigger incentives to work with russia since you know , it 's not going anywhere , anytime soon . 
  just watched john oliver 's recent show . 
  he was bitching how norway 's immigration minister said that jesus said we should everybody but that does n't mean help people in norway . 
  johnny forgot to mention how norway 's one of the highest donors of aid in the world , the second highest donor as percentage of gdp while the us ranks 20 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_development_aid_country_donors but he did not forget to mention how norway had one of europe 's strictest immigration policies . 
  this type of ignoring data , figures and numbers is friggin pathetic and boring . 
  for many countries , cheaper is better . 
  and the grippen is quite a good plane . 
  even though they talk faster they do n't actually convey more information . 
   illegal border crossing must mean nothing then . 
  it means it 's illegal not that it 's lethal . 
  do you understand the difference ? 
   this is correct behavior you do not use lethal power unless your life or the life of others is in danger . 
  wtf ? 
  honestly some people on / r/europe are `` special '' . 
   if it becomes a massive illegal border crossing . 
  so machine gunning them ? 
  yup afd should try that once they get to power . 
  tell me how it goes . 
   but remember , these `` far-right '' extremists are the real danger to our society !, 
  did this ever happen ? 
  just look at good catholic marion mar\u00e9chal le pen . 
  she 's the spitting image of her grand daddy . 
   her biggest problem is her dad , who ca n't be trusted to stay `` on message '' concerning jews . 
  in your comment you make it clear that the party is her biggest problem . 
  her dad was removed but the party remains . 
  the head of the council of jewish institutions in france said that [ while mlp was flawless from a personal pov ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/02/23/pour-le-president-du-crif-marine-le-pen-est-irreprochable-personnellement_4581604_3224.html ) the party is still full of vichysts , negationists , etc. 
  and that fn is a party to be avoided the south of france that is the biggest supporter of fn , still likes the old style fn . 
  no matter how much they deny it , the party is rotten . 
  this comment is also valid for france . 
  [ only paris is worthy of rome ; only rome is worthy of paris . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_twin_towns_and_sister_cities_of_paris ) apparently in shitty matters also . 
  i remember some dude trying to debate me how the slavs were just a linguistic group and had no relation to ethnicities . 
  and that poles are n't at all related to russians for example . 
   irstly , ancient and antiquidated are not synonyms what ? 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antiquated  ** very old and no longer useful ** , popular , or accepted : very old-fashioned or obsolete the very definition of a monarchy . 
   classes are inherent to any capitalist society . 
  we 're talking about political systems not economic ones . 
  yeah i doubt they have fiber . 
  that 's the big thing . 
   visit some other country bring your internet if you 're visiting france ... pls ... 
   money saved to start programs that would lower the costs of health care and college in the usa . 
  harvard has an endownment of 30 ** billion ** dollars . 
  it 's a business now and has no connection to what your military spending . 
  the war on terror ( afghanistan & iraq ) is what sunk your finances . 
  stop pretending it 's nato countries that are sucking up your budget . 
  those missions probably cost next to nothing and are useful to maintain the skills of the us military . 
  besides that , yeah you can do whatever you want with your army . 
  in france the state gives the medallion almost free of cost . 
  but they created a black market by themselves . 
  honestly taxi drivers are a bunch of idiots and they can go die . 
  not my fault they bought into a ponzi scheme . 
   ability to change constitution do n't you need 2/3rds of the parlament for that ? 
   but is a more democratic system automatically better ? 
  we 'll see when charles will be your king .

  not a historian but i 'll give some comments . 
  the area we see today as france was occupied by gallo-romans . 
  come 500 ad , the franks began and managed to conquer it . 
  while under a single kingdom more or less , there still were differences between the north and south . 
  the north got more frankish influences . 
  the two i already mentioned in different comments were : * language : https://slmc.uottawa.ca/content_images/314005e.gif there were two languages langues d'oil in the north with germanic influences and langues d'oc in the south that remained free of those . 
  modern france evolved from francien , a langue d'oil dialect spoken in the parisian region . 
  * law http://books.openedition.org/puam/docannexe/image/903/img-1-small700.jpg : the north became based on common law ( you 'd have things like rachimburgs similar to these guys https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lawspeaker people that would recite the law for you or you 'd the the coutume de paris ) while the south on roman written law . 
  it 's important to mention that these differences remained up until the revolution . 
  that 's when modern french became wide spread ( news from the center of the revolution which was paris was spread to all corners of france ) . 
  and napoleon created a universal civil code ( so not based on common law ) . 
  guess that shows also how important the revolution was in creating the french identity . 
   the french descend from them . 
  the french do n't really descent from the franks . 
  the french are mostly gallo-romans meet franks . 
   thing is they started speaking vulgar latin , which would later evolve to french . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  modern french comes from francien , langue d'oil dialect spoken in the paris region . 
  this is what people spoke up until the revolution https://slmc.uottawa.ca/content_images/314005e.gif, 
   when the merovingians established control on the gauls severals codes of law were exercised , but not depending on the locations but depending on the people you belonged to . 
  and that divide was a north south divide as you can see here . 
  this was a map that lasted up to the revolution . 
  http://books.openedition.org/puam/docannexe/image/903/img-1-small700.jpg  but saying north = franks and south = french seems to me like a nonsense . 
  classifying the south as french seems a bit odd . 
  maybe occitans ? 
  but the divide is there . 
  there is a langue d'oc and langue d'oil regions http://lettres.tice.ac-orleans-tours.fr/php5/coin_prof/usages-tice/hist-lang-franc/histoire_de_la_langue_francaise/oc_oil.jpg i do think a map with even more divides would be interesting and more truthful but on a european scale this is good enough . 
  also it 's important to note the importance of the revolution and of napoleon 's rule . 
  parisian french became standard at the time ( the majority of french did n't speak french ) and napoleon created the civil code . 
  it would be ** very ** wrong in my opinion to merge the franks and the people in the south . 
  i 'm confused . 
  do n't think it is . 
  first linguistically they did n't speak a common language . 
  in terms of law , the north would be in a common law type of system and the south in the written/roman type of law . 
  i do n't think making this distinction between the north and the south would be so far fetched . 
  kosovo probably because quite a few european countries do n't recognize it . 
   consider what , for example , the german president does versus what the queen ( or , in reality , for us , the governor general , the queen 's representative ) does . 
  it 's more or less the same . 
  well at least that president would be elected due to some form of merit . 
  in a republic no child is barred from obtaining any seat in a public position . 
  in a monarchy that is not the case , there are stil classes and as such it is antiquated . 
  not to mention what do you do if your next in line is an inbred/nazi etc etc.
