  they were a force to be reckoned with . 
  the empire was vast . 
  it had a global power . 
  you were the protectors of mecca andattacked vienna . 
  mehmet moved friggin ships up land to conquer constantinople . 
  you killed a 1000 year old empire . 
  and now , the influence turkey has is much much reduced . 
  it is a regional power only . 
  it lost mecca , it lost almost all of its european conquests . 
  istanbul that was at the crossroads of worlds , a central point in economy and of the world : the meeting of east and west is just some city now . 
  huge but no longer at the centre of the world . 
  it happens with the russians too . 
  they enjoy screwing things up just for the fact that their only power they have is to annoy others . 
   there are still around 100.000 armenians living ** living ** #living dude you just triggered the turks . 
  they have n't finished their business . 
   turks gave us some cuisine which is n't really the best imo ( i hate cevapi ) and some of the worst folk outfits i 've ever seen i know this will piss off some greeks but baklava is a godsend . 
  it got accepted up north because of the turks . 
  also nougat and rahat lukum . 
  and sarmas are quite popular in that region thanks to the turks . 
  said what you will , but in terms of cuisine the ottomans have been a benefit to the region . 
  france is n't that talkative either . 
  i think / u/paravin maybe means in comparison to his home country . 
  paris is clean . 
  other cities are not . 
  yes . 
  let 's admire hitler because while his policies resulted in his country being split appart for 45 years , he did get to power . 
  clearly a great politician . 
  that 's a shit type of logic . 
  great politicians are great visionaries that have a vision , execute it and the world is a better place . 
  it 's not just about : yeah he got to power and had 2 good speeches . 
  and at least he was n't a drunk dude that could barely walk . 
  gorbachev is an amazing politician . 
  putin had no vision . 
  his meddling meant that ukraine is forever lost from his sphere of influence . 
  he had his guy as president and he lost that . 
  wtf . 
   meanwhile his actions , although very unsympathetic , have made his country a powerful player on the world stage , it 's time to move off 2004 . 
  things have changed since then . 
  economy in shambles only depending on oil and gas , corruption is high as fuck , rouble lost more than 50 % in the last 2 years . 
  it is bad . 
  the soviet infrastructure has n't been changed and is crumbling but there is no money to do that . 
  russians know it 's bad . 
   he himself has ended up stronger than ever . 
  and i hope he stays until 2025 . 
  if he continues this way , he 'll drive russia into the ground . 
  his actions were destructive and russia is ** far ** ** far ** worse country than it could have been . 
  the sotchi olympics cost about 10 more ( i 'm underestimating here ) than the one in vancouver . 
  his country is on the verge or bankruptcy with the rouble losing more than half of its value in 2 years . 
  the economy is in shambles because it only depends on oil and gas . 
  it is far more isolated now than it has been in the last 20 years . 
  stop jerking off to putin , he was bad for russia . 
  le pen is considered to have personally tortured people during the algerian war . 
  so take that as you will . 
   it 's not zig-zagging to express recognition of putin 's political skills while at the same time recognizing him as an unsympathetic human being . 
  i 'd far more appreciate someone who likes putin as a human being but thinks his actions have been stupid . 
  yeah . 
  no ubs banks in france . 
  nope . 
  ubs is a tiny local bank . 
  family owned . 
  exactly . 
   http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study that 's why eu immigrants are a net benefit to the uk . 
  they are less likely to ask for benefits than the average brit . 
  but hey let 's continue talking about the poor uneducated unskilled eastern european . 
  is n't obvious we have a different view of society and the world ? 
  i believe it is a bad idea to turn down the poor and uneducated and only accept the smart that the former colonies already spent a fortune educating . 
  if we accept only those already fully educated and successful we would have never gotten marie curie . 
  more reason for the uk to take them in and solve the case . 
  the most famous detectives sherlock holmes and hercule poirot were inventions of british authors  you guys love a good mystery . 
  there . 
  i put a sarcasm tag for you  better now ? 
  i 'm sorry i startled you . 
  of course i did n't know anything about the chechen wars . 
  pretty sure a skilled doctor is more useful in a country that has so few of them , do n't you think ? 
  uhm . 
  those people still work and live in france . 
  they extract the money from here . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're trolling or not . 
  it 's soft colonialism . 
  we 're doing them a favour by accepting their smart people to work here in the west . 
  we 're good people like that . 
  if a tax fraudster opened an account in switzerland , and the french fiscal police asks for the info , they have to give it . 
  how is it inneficient ? 
  but the immigrants are n't . 
  it 's a crime in switzerland nonetheless . 
  what ? 
  if the rates bother you , do n't live in france . 
  we 're not racing to the bottom here . 
  how does the eu block uk from having that ? 
  if uk wants to impose a point system on all immigrants then they should leave eea . 
  i 'm pretty sure this conversation has been had thousands of times before . 
   any rumours of kremlin involvement ? 
  when did the kremlin ever get involved in chechnyan affairs ? 
  edit : apparently / r/europe is lost without a / s tag . 
   eu should help to deport those who have no hope for asulym like the moroccon . 
  why should the eu help ? 
  they got themselves into that problem , they should get themselves out of it . 
  maybe he is but that makes / u / - plastic - [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfgang_sch%c3%a4uble#/media/file:angela_merkel,_wolfgang_sch%c3%a4uble_%28tobias_koch%29_2.jpg ), 
  yup . 
  took us two years to find out who we voted for .
