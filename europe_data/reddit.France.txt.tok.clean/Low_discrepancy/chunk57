  well if you issue warnings , what do you expect . 
  unlike you , i take the job mods do seriously . 
  maybe you can learn from your peers how they mod . 
  we 're not the only ones that love to extend our feet beyond out borders :d . 
  i 'm juste saying it 's related to the high mountains in the french-swiss-italian area and not the german part . 
  what 's so shocking about that . 
  adding wine to melted cheese would n't be a german thing . 
  wow a hungarian that believes culture stops at the border and does n't spread to its neighbours . 
  you must be one of a kind in your country , 
   775,000 are from morocco . 
   https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/diaspora_marocaine 1.2 m if you count up to second generation maroccans and 2.5 million up to 4 generations ( a bit wonky if you ask me ) . 
  i am pleased to say that both the raclette and the fondue that / u/tsunamig and / u/thorinar mentioned are from the french speaking areas of switzerland . 
  i could hardly see a german speaker say `` let 's melt some strong cheese . 
  and put wine into it . 
  yummy '' . 
   but tbh we had a similar situation during the last decade , when we got around 4 million extra immigrants and according to the eu it was a local issue so we did n't get any meaningful help that link only talks about immigration rates . 
  i 'm betting the vast majority of those immigrants are eu citizens . 
  for example 730k of those are romanians . 
  i would engage in a battle of wits but i 'm only half prepared . 
   asymmetrically mutually intelligible sounds like a war strategy . 
   when i 'm in italy i literally can stop eating it . 
  you just insulted quite a few italians . 
   swiss dish based on cheese - fondue !, 
  triggered ... 
  this is more like in the region of france , switzerland and italy . 
   it does n't matter what you called him . 
  you are ignoring my main question . 
  what is the ad hominem attack ? 
  can you prove the person is not a minor ? 
  and how is calling someone a minor , an attack ? 
  if you wan na be a mod , act the part . 
  do you have a quota of warnings to fulfill and you 're scrapping the barrel now ? 
  the person asked me if i am dafted . 
   http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/daft meaning :  silly or stupid how is that not an aggressive behaviour ? 
  is it because it is in a question form ? 
  that would be silliest thing ever . 
   it does n't matter what you called him . 
  are you being serious ? 
  what is this ? 
  american hs ? 
  zero tolerance policies ? 
  there 's no difference between calling someone a `` shit stain on the surface of the globe '' and `` aggressive '' ? 
  are you telling me there is absolutely no difference whatsoever ? 
  dude , you dun goofed . 
  spain is neighbours too morocco . 
  morocco is one , if not the most stable country in the region . 
  stable political system , good policing etc. 
  unlike algeria , they do n't really get terrorist attacks -  good secret services . 
  and they have good border protection . 
  morocco has closed its border ( which is massive ) with algeria for 20 years . 
  closed off , no one crosses . 
  this helps a huge huge deal with migration . 
  italy has a problem because lybia and greece because of syria . 
  actually you should . 
  if you do n't the emissions cheat wo n't get fixed . 
  darn that hitler fellow really asks for a high mark-up . 
  can you tell where the personal attack is ? 
   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/12/austria.ianblack in 2000 , the eu started putting in place sanctions because the extreme right party fpo was part of a govt coalition . 
  if one is a moderator in / r/europe one should know the recent political events . 
  or do you mean tyke ? 
   http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tyke tyke = funny child . 
  you should n't be so thin skinned . 
  i have no proof / u/d3adline is n't a child . 
  unless you 're in uk , it 's after midnight . 
  so 9 days left . 
  tick tock . 
  i wan na see some action happening . 
  it 's just common sense . 
  a solution of this problem ** has to involve ** greece . 
   france does n't take much migrants but we do . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 meh about the same size . 
  and year after year we accept about 10k asylum applications . 
  stop complaining . 
  that being said . 
  what a friggin great idea from austria , to not invite greece on the talks . 
  now re-read the title in clarkson 's voice . 
  get outta here with your logic . 
  i do n't agree with their decision . 
  i also think it is silly . 
  but it 's not like they told him he ca n't present his paper . 
  it 's one of those shitty things that happens . 
  i had the impression he would have gotten it , but he also wanted to go to austria . 
  well that 's a good think on the pakistani govt . 
  brain drain is a horrible thing . 
  he states that :  he obtained his masters and phd degrees from austria . 
  his interests include research , writing on social issues and critical thinking . 
  well i 'm sure he can have much more of an impact ( both in research ** and ** in tackling social issues ) in pakistan than in austria . 
  if we take all the resources those countries have , they 'll never improve , will they ? 
  ever heard of a joke . 
  try it some time , it 's not harmful . 
   to visit the same streets in austria where i had walked for five years , to see my tiny writings on the walls in different places at the university campus with the hope that i would still find them well there ya go . 
  now you know why yourvisa application was refused . 
  edit : for the thickos out there . 
  it 's a joke . 
   edit , i was wrong about credit ratings . 
  you may also be denied entry back to europe if the matter is reported to the police . 
  can i see a source for that ? 
  but do n't you know that t mobile will go bankrupt if he does n't pay . 
  he should be responsible . 
  if he is n't able to pay that clearly shows how irresponsible he is .
