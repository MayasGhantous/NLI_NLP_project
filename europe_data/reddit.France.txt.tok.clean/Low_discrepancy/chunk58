  cuz i am a logical being . 
  do n't be man . 
  that drive for logic thinking is getting me a phd in maths now . 
   that is just a terrible mindset and you 'll understand it when you grow up and become an adult . 
  welp guess we got ta wait . 
   you are a prime example of why we can not have nice things in europe . 
  debtor prison is a nice thing for you ? 
  mkay . 
  if he ca n't pay his debt , he ca n't . 
  lets all move on . 
  because not being able to pay your bills = raping and killing . 
  are you friggin serious ? 
  i 'll go to vichy when ill be older . 
  no , in france we think it 's a good idea to get insured . 
  the largest insurance company in europe is french . 
   http://www.relbanks.com/top-insurance-companies/europe insurance is your friend . 
   why are you so defensive about it ? 
  because i do n't understand people talking about dubai expats , about debt collection about multi-billion euro companies having to hike pricess , about the good name of asians being dragged in the mud because ** one ** friggin asian dude left the country . 
  like europe 's problems are because of that ** one ** dude . 
  or heck because people leave with one month 's worth of rent to pay . 
  we 're being over dramatical on such a tiny insignificant thing it 's getting boring . 
  i wo n't waste any more of my govt paid for time talking on this silly issue . 
  cheers, 
  do you honestly believe in china or wherever the dude is from , they check german utility debt . 
  okay fine . 
  then the new landlord should ask for a higher deposit . 
  either way he got one so i do n't see why we 're complaining . 
  and in france you get a tax reduction if you subscribe to a warranty for unpaid rent . 
  so there you go . 
  two different systems . 
   if all chinese did this well they do n't . 
  just ** one ** person did it . 
  one . 
  really it 's just one case . 
  not more . 
  just one single person . 
  trust me . 
  one . 
  a whole number more than zero but less than two . 
  well / u/lolaruns said he should pay his bills or he 'll give a bad name to people from his country . 
  on what type of planet does that make sense . 
  if he ca n't pay his bill okay . 
  what does that have to do with the rest of the people in his country ? 
  if from a single case , we generalise , we call that xenophobia or racism . 
  for example : the greek govt did n't pay its debts . 
  that means all greeks are lousy people that do n't pay their debts and you should never trust them . 
  because it makes no goddamn sense . 
  is the anschluss still a thing , because his case was in germany . 
  if we 're talking about other euro countries , well the landlord received a deposit . 
  usually it 's at least a month 's rent . 
   austria that you can not buy a phone as a foreigner any more unless you have lived here for some period of time . 
  well he was in germany . 
  you just show your id and they give you a sim card . 
  so he wont get a loan in germany . 
  that 's fair i believe and notmal behaviour . 
   you bow down so for foreigners . 
  the hell you are talking about ? 
   no , but they might sell his debt to a collector in his country . 
  is that even legal ? 
   also , not informing and escaping is childish . 
  that 's not a legal issue . 
   still , it needs to be understood that you are very much encouraging him to commit a crime . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  it this 1800s europe . 
  what friggin crime did / u/davidrao commit ? 
  #in europe it is not a crime to be broke . 
  #in europe we dont have debtor prisons . 
  more so : #in europe it is legal to be broke and not have money . 
  he can declare bankruptcy and that 's it . 
  you are destroying 70 + years of social successes that europe has obtained . 
  the op did not commit ** any ** crime whatsoever . 
  you should bother checking a little european history and why we 're in the situation we are in now , where a poor person can still live in europe . 
  we do n't need more people in europe that believe being poor is a crime . 
  that if you 're poor you are dirt . 
  i pay my bills to those multi-billion companies to the price they ask and if someone can not afford to pay them , so be it . 
  before moving to europe , you should understand social europe . 
   ecovering some of the funds that otherwise would 've been frittered away like the rest of it uhm , they 're getting imf loans to pay back the previous loans . 
  it 's dumb as fuck . 
  but we tell them to do it because we do n't want other countries to do it . 
   bailiffs do n't knock your door down to scare other debtees into paying up , they do it to recover lost assets . 
  look at their debt . 
  it increased by 70 percentage points since we started the measures . 
  ** we made it worse ** but they have to pay . 
  not because it 's a hude amount , on the grand scheme of things , it is not . 
  but once you add italy 's , spain 's the portuguese and the irisih debt : wow , good luck surviving that . 
  weird . 
  it does n't surprise me that you think reality is an insult . 
   i had cases were the guy was still there but not paying take 18 months . 
  so my i ask why did n't you take an insurance ? 
  you have a business that gets only 3 % profit , but you can afford 18 months of 0 ** income ** , not profits mind you ? 
  dude you 'd need a decade to get back to positive again . 
   14 days later if i did not here from him i would need to go to court wait a few months to have the court session then get the title to execute against him and then get his contract canceled . 
  that says more about the laws of your country . 
   the guy was still there well / u/davidrao made everybody a favor by leaving . 
  if he also notified the landlord then it 's perfect . 
  it 's not exactly his fault if he told everybody he 's leaving but your country need 6 months to catch up , is it ? 
  in france it is very difficult to evict someone , but if they leave it 's quicker . 
  an official sends a letter to the rented home . 
  if in a months time he gets no reply , the official can enter the house , see if its actually unoccupied and as such he can also seize the goods in the house and auction them . 
  but again that is not the procedure for a normal eviction .
