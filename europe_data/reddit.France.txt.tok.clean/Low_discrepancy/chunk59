   it 's a frikking email . 
  do the standup thing . 
  do n't be an asshole . 
  so we agree . 
  / u/davidrao should tell his landlord he 's not coming back . 
  the landlord gets the deposit everything is fine and dandy . 
  the multi-billion companies like e.on or t-mobile have an insurance so they do n't give a crap about one month 's worth of bills . 
   that 's the way life is . 
  do n't be an unecessary asshole when the price is a frikking email . 
  this is about paying the bills not writing an email . 
   what 's the benefit of being vindictive to the czechs in trade negotiations ? 
  what 's the benefit of bleeding the greeks dry ? 
  so the portuguese and irish et all do n't come later and say they want their debt erased too . 
  if you treat one in a special way , everybody will want to be treated specially . 
  that and of itself is enough . 
  but i agree , if the czechs want to return to the pre 2004 situation , that is a good thing . 
   neither you nor i know when `` one more student with a small amount of debt '' becomes the tipping point for a company to change policy . 
  dude the landlord got the deposit . 
  the multi-billion dollar utility companies do n't give a rat 's ass . 
   if he does n't cancel his lease , legally his landlord will have to formally cancel and legally will have to get a court verdict to have him formally evicted even if he knows that he fucked off back to asia and will never return . 
  okay so we agree . 
  he should tell the landlord he is n't coming back and he can keep the deposit . 
  there now it 's all fair and square . 
  now we hope t mobile wo n't keel over because a student could n't pay his bills : /, 
  good i hope you learnt something . 
  i dislike illogical people that claim to know stuff . 
  dude , you are exaggerating . 
  no one will give a crap . 
  unless he bothers to send a check , no one will bother him because it costs ** waaaaay ** more to take any means to get the money ( and in all likelihood there are n't any ) than it takes to let it slide . 
  the landlord got the deposit , the multi-billion dollar utility companies do n't give a flying fuck . 
  what would you do with the deposit in this case ? 
  it 's not like / u/davidrao 's landlord said fine fine , gim me the key , take the deposit and you 'll pay me when you have time . 
  like it or not we 're talking about ** one ** goddamn student that left . 
   demand higher security deposits or will refuse to commit to a contract . 
  because of one guy that left without pbbly getting his degree . 
  yeah . 
  his burden is high enough . 
   however what he is doing is fucking over others from his country that come after him he does n't fuck over any one . 
  any responsible utility company should have an insurance . 
   because the more people act like him the harder it will be for future students to get contracts . 
  it 's a months worth of bills and rent . 
  honest to god stop making it seem like he bankrupted a small country because he did n't pay his bills . 
  and no . 
  / u/davidrao did n't pay his bills . 
  not all asian students or whatever . 
  stop generalising . 
  you claim that no borders + single currency is awful . 
  well the czechs and ee is in a no borders + own currency . 
  they 're in heaven . 
  the products made there and bought in we get almost nothing extra taxes and they can control their own currency . 
  it 's a wonderful situation for them, 
   what matter is banks , factories , large shops , distribution , services channels and so on . 
  yes it 's all about jp morgan , amazon and google . 
  unless you have these companies , your economy is worth shit . 
  if you want big companies , you have to create them . 
  google or amazon did n't land from thin air . 
  you have to create those companies that propose services and you need people to buy those services . 
  and heck all those companies i 've mentioned are publicly traded . 
  how many poles buy stocks ? 
  how many have a stock portfolio ? 
  how many poles invest in either big companies or start ups ? 
  the deals the czech republic gets after they leave depends in the lobbying power they have and on the political leverage . 
  they 're out of the eu so they have 0 political leverage . 
  and they have no know lobbying power . 
  no major eu company is desperate for the czech market . 
  so if i read you and / u/lolaruns correctly then / u/davidrao does n't really have to pay those bills if he does n't want to return to germany . 
  except for morality reasons , which are a good reason as any , he does n't really have to . 
  how burden is not to be able to go to germany . 
   you will increase the negative reputation of your countrymen so he should pay his bills because of racism and xenophobia ? 
  why would n't those utility companies take insurance in case of unpaid bills . 
  this is a student we 're talking about not a friggin powerplant . 
  dude we 're talking about utility bills of a student . 
  stop being ridiculous . 
  this is n't some high spender . 
  goddamn since when did a student become a dubai expat . 
  no one would give a flying shit . 
  we do n't keep track of fraudsters that cause a debt of 60 billion in france , you telling me we 'll check some poor student . 
  do you understand how lobbying works ? 
  how much lobby power does the czech republic have ? 
   the eu can be as cut-throat with them as they wish and it 's legally fine . 
  we wo n't be cut-throat . 
  just look at greece . 
  quick question . 
  what 's the status of start-ups in poland . 
  how easy is it for a polish to create a start up , fail but learn some new things , start a new venture , fail again and maybe at the 3rd time to be successful ? 
  how many people do you know that created a start-up ? 
  are bright poles likely to remain in poland or do they do n't mind leaving for we where they get paid double or triple for the same work performed ? 
  what about the govt ? 
  how easy is it for it to start massive projects to support the local economy ? 
  and how likely are poles to support innovative new things ? 
  how much of their budget to the save for unnecessary stuff ? 
  some of these answers might explain why poland still ca n't create major companies . 
  ( cd project red not included ) . 
   you have no border with rich countries and share the same currency , meaning your competitiveness against them is terrible . 
  tell me more how the czech republic is in the eurozone . 
  free borders and different currencies is a godsend for poor countries . 
  why ? 
  it 's not like they can come after him and if he does n't plan to return he should be fine . 
   some citizens of those countries feel treated unequally . 
  well some of those citizens voted for a eu sceptic party in poland for example .
