  you 'd still give him a mouthpiece . 
  well unless kerviel is a redditor , no one here had a 7.5 billion dollar fuck up . 
  yeah putin reign # 3 when he should have had at most 2 . 
  ( without the sham one of medvedev ) . 
  he must really suck at building democracies if he needs what ? 
  17 years to build one and he 's still not there ? 
   but not democracies that are willing to reject eu terms russia is hardly a democracy . 
   and if they bribe the `` right '' people , they may even succeed . 
  how ? 
  they 'll simply go out of business if they do n't change . 
  what stops the germans from moving to those countries and getting welfare there , then ? 
  the ones living in france do get their corresponding benefits . 
  well the claim the germans are using for not paying benefits is  unbearable pressure on their finances why do some people cause that pressure while others dont ? 
  ah an anarchist . 
  i 'll ignore your blabbering then . 
  cheers . 
  but does n't that `` put an unbearable pressure on their finances . '', 
  if so , they should pick at random x number of foreigners to give welfare before 5 years . 
  ( where x is the number of orphan broke germans that did n't contribute to the welfare system ) . 
  it 's not like germany does n't benefit from skilled workers moving to germany . 
  everybody wants their cake and eat it too . 
  why not block welfare for all citizens if they have n't worked for 5 years regardless of their nationality ? 
  it 's not like an orphan german teenager that has never worked , actually contributed to the system . 
  honestly the eu is more and more confusing . 
  everybody does as they wish . 
   every economic system had millions of victims so far . 
  well in the case of communism , it was the forced aspect of it . 
  there were forced collectivisations , forced relocations , mass famines that could have been easily avoided . 
   more in the 10-20 million range rather than the 60 million . 
  in no shape or form does that figure include the holodomor . 
  yes . 
  it 's well know that the eu would n't like a democratic russia . 
  we vastly prefer your dictatorships . 
   but if you get caught here , you are in deep doo doo . 
  by `` you '' , you obviously mean foreign companies . 
  because local ones or governement pulling shit like torturing people or toppling democratic governments , they get a free pass . 
  are you saying that the eu and the us behave in the very same way . 
  say it is n't so . 
  say it is n't so man . 
  can we get off our high horses now ? 
  we 'll get hemoroids if we ride for too long . 
   you know , like how filthy nox emissions are legal in the eu , but not the us ? 
  again , i am confused . 
  the links i 've given you show that vw will be fined . 
  so why are you complaining about ? 
   like how filthy nox emissions are legal in the eu how are they legal ? 
  vw will get fined for cheating . 
  and the eu raised the bar . 
  what is your beef ? 
   you seem unable to comprehend rule of law you seem to refuse to understand that laws can change . 
   i 'm saying we respect the rule of law more . 
  says who ? 
  we fined a couple of us companies for their cartel and monopoly positions like google , microsoft . 
  did the us ever bother to do that ? 
  why does n't the us apply the law , maaan . 
   you can say our laws suck , but we do enforce them . 
  dude , do you circle jerk to the anthem , pledge of alliegence , flag , bald eagle or picture of your aircraft carrier fleet ? 
  or is it your constitution ... got ta be the constitution . 
   the us has stricter emissions standards than europe at the federal level , and some states are far more strict . 
  not car emissions , but general emissions . 
  check some graphs on co2 emissions some time . 
   who provided the vast majority of refueling tankers , cargo planes , drones & a fuckton of the intelligence . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval  the us air force has established an air bridge between the istres-le tub\u00e9 air base in the south of france and malian capital bamako , using up to five c-17 globemaster iii transport planes to ferry french equipment and troops to mali . 
  [ 68 ] a small contingent of american troops will provide flight support operations at bamako . 
  [ 69 ] on january 26 , us defense secretary leon panetta informed french minister jean-yves le drian that the `` us africa command will support the french military by conducting aerial refueling missions as operations in mali continue '' . 
  [ 70 ] over the course of operation serval , up to 5 us kc-135 were deployed to conduct air refueling missions with french mirage and rafales including an impressive 100 sorties in less than two months . 
  [ 71 ] wow 5 kc 15 and 5 c 17s indeed . 
  dude without you nothing would have worked . 
  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/op%c3%a9ration_serval the 4000 soldiers , 6 rafales , 8 mirages , 5 kc , 5 patrol planes , those do n't count for nothing . 
  you are indeed pulling a ww2 now . 
  bit pathetic do n't you think ? 
   vw violated eu emissions law , as a result , the emissions standards ( already much weaker than us regs ) were rolled back . 
  so you tell me ? 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/eu-policymakers-seek-power-to-fine-carmakers-for-anti-pollution-cheating http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb962871258174089808  and i 'm not sure what fines they are facing for breaking the rules . 
  darn googling must be hard . 
   as for the eu budget rules , has anyone been punished for that ? 
  well we do like you and raise the limit . 
  lol . 
  dude , moving the goal post much ? 
  stop pretending the us is perfect . 
  it 's the same shit . 
  my bad . 
  small flags , what can i say ? 
   but when they get caught breaking the law , they are punished . 
  and uhm , that does n't happen in europe ? 
   nothing it about morals , it 's about following the law . 
  dude i think you are clueless about the ford pinto incident . 
  let me fill you in . 
  the engineers knew a fault they made would result in a massive explosion with dead people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zknbvvrwos somewhere betwee 27 and 180 people died . 
  ford did n't do a recall because they calculated that the number of deaths * times * the amount of settlements per death would be smaller than the amount of recall . 
  oh here 's another example of how moral and law abiding your car companies are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ford_pinto#cost-benefit_analysis.2c_the_pinto_memo, 
   when we have a law , we follow it . 
  [ you sure follow it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_motors_ignition_switch_recalls ) . 
  to the letter . 
   when i like something , i support it , when i do n't , i criticize it . 
  a rant is not criticism . 
   force his hand on mali https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_mali_conflict france : 3000 soldiers . 
  is this a ww2 `` we beat the nazis '' type of thing ? 
   you 're fucking useless when it comes to military affairs . 
  dude at this moment europe and the us are playing a game of who 's worse at war .
