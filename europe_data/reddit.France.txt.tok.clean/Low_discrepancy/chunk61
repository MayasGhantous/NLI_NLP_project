   how generations were brought up in that kind of atmosphere what atmosphere ? 
  that any type of political dissent was forbidden ? 
  that any small joke to a co worker could see you fired with a permanent criminal record ? 
  that you could only trust your most immediate family , anyone else could send you to jail . 
  heck check romania about 700 000 people were informants for the securitate . 
  there was mass surveillance . 
  it created the most cynical people in europe . 
   the question is why has n't that atmosphere of sudden progression to economical and social aspects of life continued in ee because there was n't such a thing . 
  homosexuality was illegal in the ussr  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_history_in_russia there was rampant alcoholism , etc etc. 
  you have a very skewed picture of what communism was . 
  stopping reading communist reports on what communism was . 
   but got it right on others . 
  there are romanians out there that think that communist romania was a hotbed of equality ? 
  women , just like men were a simple means of production . 
  equality was n't something that started from principles . 
  it was something that started from lack of resources . 
  after the war , the lack of men meant that more women had to work in factories . 
  and the salaries were n't high enough to afford having your wife be a housewife . 
  she had to workin order for the state to allocate you and apartment . 
  but that was n't equality in rights . 
  again women were a means of production . 
  and in 66 ceausescu decided that women had to produce babies so he banned abortion . 
  of course when you ban abortion , those who suffer are women . 
  we still do n't know how many women died because of botched illegal abortions . 
  but the movie 7 4 2 gives a nice view if the era . 
  concerning day to day life , again there was n't that much equality there either . 
  it the country side it was quite common to beat your wife , and unless you put her in a hospital the police would n't bother you very much . 
  and concerning high ranking female communists that had influence ? 
  there really were n't that many . 
  the only one i can think of is ana pauker and that 's it . 
  in 45 years of communism rule , that is n't much . 
  yes because we 're talking about eurozone funds to which uk contributes yet they do not receive anything . 
  the one you cited seems to be open to be used by uk if needed . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stability_facility   and   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism   the uk does n't seem to have contributed to any . 
  what gives ? 
  okay lem me help upu here since maybe you are no proficient in english . 
  by `` any '' i mean those that were cited by myself . 
   have no access to the funds provided by efsf/esm those seem to be the two ones i 've listed . 
  the topic was about uk contributing to funds that are exclusive for the eurozone . 
  paying for something they can not benefit from . 
   aims at preserving financial stability in europe by providing financial assistance to member states of the european union in economic difficulty how is this fund just for eurozone states ? 
  uk can benefit from this if it is ever in a problem . 
   well does it matter which terorist organization ? 
  is that you ? 
  we 've got so many of them . 
  the muslims wrt the jewish : bwaaaa why do you treat the jewish differently from us , bwaaaa . 
   `` avoid the word : immigrant . '', 
  immigrant usually means you 're not a citizen of said country . 
  i prefer the british spelling , usually . 
  god knows they throw a fit if they see color and honor . 
   `` schools have become no more than windowless , airless little basement rooms in the education system , in which children suffocate , '' istvan pukli , god , i hope no one will rip a fart in there . 
  do n't tell your british friends . 
  they 'll be jealous . 
  the brits are a courageous crowd . 
  these people are primed to have for head of state prince charles . 
  nothing anyone can say can frighten them . 
   i can go home to women of any nationality now women of any nationality can feel underwhelmed . 
  truly great times we are living through !, 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stability_facility and  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism the uk does n't seem to have contributed to any . 
  what gives ? 
   my misses is belgian now the belgians will see how proficient lovers the british make . 
  do you really want that type of `` fame '' to cross borders ? 
   wanted to and did . 
  if any non euro country is facing defaulting , do n't you think everyone should help ? 
  they did it for romania for example :  http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/25/romania-bailed-out-recession if you do n't wan na be in a ** union ** , you are free to leave . 
   onable demand in front of the french public opinion . 
  the two most important french papers do not mention this story . 
  lefigaro.fr and lemonde.fr, 
   i think they are more likely to leave europe all together , they 'll jump into that tardis and go 4 billion years into the future ? 
  [ you mean american ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/sep/07/sarah-palin-tells-immigrants-to-the-us-to-speak-american-video ) if you ever have to work with a few bosses , you will realise you got ta dumb it down to the level of the least smartest one . 
  yes man . 
  but in the end of the day , you still have to go home to your british women and eat british food : /, 
  just because we sold a few exocet ? 
  lighten up . 
  romania was the only country to have a bloody revolution because it was n't a communist regime like the others around it . 
  ceausescu split from russia influence to follow china . 
  it became more of a nationalist dictatorship . 
  and since ceausescu visited north korea , he picked up some habits from there . 
  does he have any numbers or sources ? 
  the question is about a ** brother ** nation and i 'm expressing how things are . 
  we are much much closer to the belgians and i 'd think they 're our brother nation . 
  you 'll tell me next that you 've never met a french making a difference between canadians . 
  you of all people , i 'm amazed that would deny the importance of language :p, 
   getting offended simply because of the difference in definitions and i am a we ? 
  no ee would ever be offended by such a difference . 
  that sounds a bit like bs ( and is bs but i wont go into details ) . 
  nationality is basically where you belong . 
  this is what / u/lejankata says when he mentions that they 're guests . 
  they do no belong . 
  the situation is temporary . 
  and they 'll leave soon as good nomads . 
  that is what i am criticising and that is what is n't actual and factual . 
  the gypsies will be there in 200 years in 300 years . 
  they 'll contribute and benefit from your society . 
  they have as much right to the soil as any other person . 
  are you wallon or from bruxelles ? 
   in ee , nationality = ethnicity wut ? 
  ee has minorities , has movements of population . 
  you are trying to define things using your own personal views on the matter .
