  let 's say each border only stop 10 % of the people ( you 'll agree that stopping 1 in 10 immigrants is a pretty useless border ) . 
  well after they pass 6 borders , only 50 % of immigrants that started from turkey will get to their final destination . 
  a series of dumb borders gets you 1 acceptable filter . 
  50 % of immigrants stopped means at least a doubling of costs for people smugglers . 
  they no longer need to pass people from turkey to greece , they need to have rat lines up to germany , across the continent . 
  that means the smugglers will ask at least for double the amount . 
  that means that they far fewer immigrants will manage to pay them and far fewer fake refugees will take such a route . 
  real refugees would want to stay in the first safe place they can . 
  in conclusion , this is all about ** layered security ** , which is a good thing . 
  ps : layered security is why schengen is a bad thing . 
  people who 'll tell you : no it 's good if you actually protect our borders with a good frontex are like people that tell you that if you have a good antivirus you can go download everything you want . 
  and also why a universal backdoor for software is a bad idea . 
  the title read like the title from either a james bond novel or a twilight zone episode . 
  dude put some quotes on that . 
  here i was thinking wow this redditor has a really awesome life . 
  and he may be full of himself but he 's common people . 
  and does what every common people do . 
  pitesti phenomenon . 
  google it . 
  while this dude did n't work there , he was part of the regime that oppressed political prisoners even through torture ( that was applied where he worked ) . 
   the law when he did these stuff was different . 
  you mean to say torture was legal in communist romania ? 
  any sauces for that ? 
  it mostly likely de facto legal but never de jure . 
  and here you are arguing for de jure . 
  i feel that putting him in prison right is bad taste at pitesti , they 'd put the prisoners to clean the toilets and the floors with cloths that they held by their teeth . 
  ** that ** must have been the real bad taste . 
  this is just saying sorry buddy the law applies even if you 're old . 
  yeah . 
  that 's why all those laws are about civil marriage . 
  religious marriage counts for nothing . 
   he gives his views just like any other person . 
  yes . 
  disgusting views . 
  h\u00e9 juste tells catholicos how to vote . 
  orthodoxy was used by russia to impose its power . 
  kinda line it 's doing today with russophile 's . 
  also hating gay people who want to get married . 
  what a horrible person indeed . 
   they have it all fingered out ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  if the great spider wants you to molest children , what can you do ? 
   then you say that fn is racist and fascist , i 've read their whole 110 pages program , the political programming is n't what they 'll implement . 
  let 's take concrete examples . 
  at beziers the mayor ( very close to fn and calls for people to vote marine lp ) wanted to make a list of all muslim sounding names and declared them all muslims . 
  would you like for your givt to make a list of your religion ? 
  he also wants to ban kebab shops . 
  would you like your givt to tell you what food to eat and what restaurants there should be put in place ? 
  let people decide based on tastes . 
  so that 's how the robot revolution started . 
  john connor was a tax man for the irs, 
  i propose an exam like a driver 's licence . 
  you are also explained what routes to take . 
  dead ends etc etc. 
  that 's a good deal . 
  hmm . 
  let 's put a pin on it . 
  maybe we can start differently . 
  how about we give you marseille and ajaccio for genoa ? 
  google ajaccio man , you 'll see it 's worth it . 
  marseille is like that too , trust me . 
  no need to google it , 
  how about corsica for aoste valley and liguria ? 
   no but it 's their legal right as eu citizens to move to france . 
  they are crossing the borders legally and that 's why they can stay for 3 months in france . 
  after if they have no income and no housing and no purpose to be here , they are invited out . 
   it is in fact illegal for one eu member to expel eu citizens to another eu state . 
  well no , no it is n't . 
  countries just dont do it often . 
  romania is n't in schengen . 
  and where do we send those ones ? 
  they ripped their papers and do n't say anything . 
  the romanians have passports and they come from a safe country . 
  they 're not war refugees . 
  we gave asylum to about 13k people from jan to sept 2015 . 
  weird how different situations are treated differently , do n't you think ? 
   dutch ( and german and finnish and other ) popular opinion is against romanian entering schengen so the dutch politicians ignore eu treaties their countries signed and do n't allow romania in because they do n't want to commit political suicide . 
  nobody calls them populists or anything ... well france has to send home 13k romanians because they live in subhuman conditions here . 
  they have no income , no housing and live in tents . 
  it 's not safe for anyone hence why they send them home . 
  unlike syria , romania is pretty safe . 
  we 'll give you corsica for the piedmont . 
   we are n't talking about gun laws , we 're talking about easy access to guns . 
  hence why if you have string gun laws , you can still get screwed by your neighbours . 
  we just have to wait for the british to learn french ... 
   do corporate meetings in france also have to have union leaders in them ? 
  define corporate meetings because it can be very large : from company wide decisions that can impact every employee to 3 dudes deciding on what pens to buy . 
  article from last december . 
  we already saw this news , you editorialised the title :  pour valls , le fn peut conduire \u00e0 la `` guerre civile '' for valls , the fn might lead to `` civil war '' . 
  keep the title correct or do n't bother . 
   and the main reason for that are the disgustingly powerful workers unions which hold france back . 
  goddamn it man , you are slow . 
  about 7 % of workers are in a union . 
  unions are much more powerful in germany . 
  but hey , long live stereotypes . 
  that 's his speech . 
  he had it for the past few months . 
  well if i had to pick one , i guess the louvre . 
  and one i 'd really want to visit would be the smitchsonian national air and space museum . 
  so that it makes better sense . 
  poor russia .
