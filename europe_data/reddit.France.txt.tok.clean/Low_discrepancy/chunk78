  therefore it is newsworthy and not clickbaity . 
  it 's not like denmark or switzerland was criticizing the czech republic . 
  and it 's not like the people that criticized the czech republic can not criticize denmark or switzerland . 
   dude , it 's obviously meant as a deterrent deterrent for what ? 
  asylum seekers ? 
  they come in , apply . 
  if accepted they stay , if not you escort them out . 
  why do you need to have a deterrent for such a process ? 
  do you have a deterrent for people to not go to the er ? 
  applying for asylum is ** a human right ** . 
   i 'm guessing pretty much only cash will be in seized in the end , if anyone is actually carrying a large amount of it . 
  that 's what you say . 
  what the article says :  refugees arriving in switzerland have to turn over to the state any assets worth more than 1,000 swiss francs ( # 690 ) to help pay for their upkeep so * the swiss go full debtor prison . 
  * is the police in denmark going to poor people and confuscating their money ? 
  i think the answer is no . 
   do n't make it sound so much worse than it actually is . 
  how ? 
  i 'm stating what 's in the article and what the danish legislation is . 
  ** confiscation = / = voluntarily selling your things **, 
  out of memory i can not remember when it happened last in france . 
  ( lets not talk about mediator ) . 
   but a state should not put itself in a position where it could be compared to a terrorist organisation has there every been a state that did n't fight fire with fire ? 
  it 's more the ** brain dead because of a trial ** that made me click rather the cannabinoid part . 
  saved . 
  is it higher in brazil too ? 
  cuz they 're number 5 . 
  heck the standard of living is higher in luxembourg than in denmark . 
  how ? 
  do you think that many syrians come with valuables worth more than 690 euros ? 
  used smartphone : 150 euros max . 
  wedding rings : 200 euros . 
  clothes : okay you can take their clothes . 
  i kinda doubt these people come with tons of valuables either way . 
  recently we were told that the danes are the happiest people in the world . 
  is it because you create your own little bubble in which you live problem free ? 
  to the surprise of no one ... 
  of course . 
  she 's old . 
  trust me , if you 'd see her , you 'd start shooting up your school . 
  ca n't be . 
  he 's not austrian . 
   it 's completely normal to enter the bathroom when someone 's showering or taking a bath . 
  i 'll ask the obvious question : does n't anyone beat the bishop ? 
   my mother comes in to take a piss when i am in the shower and she needs too . 
  thats kinda gross man . 
  charles ix ( though his mother catherine de medici was a bigger influence ) and the st. bartholomew massacre . 
  robespierre of course is highly controversial . 
  ( this to change from the classic petain ) . 
   ) i was expecting that from hungary . 
  imagine how many serial killers during medieval times . 
  he stabbed a few chocos in the back . 
  huh ? 
  how old are you ? 
  it was all over the news when it was exposed . 
  well i 'm saying morsi was a democracy elected by free elections . 
  it was still the muslim brotherhood that wanted to install sharia . 
  a majority of muslims do want sharia . 
  it 's only democratic to have it . 
  morsi was elected through a free election . 
  just because it 's free doesnt make it logical . 
   it takes a lot more , checks and balances , human rights , freedom of press , etc. 
  why ? 
   democracy definition . 
  a system of government in which power is vested in the people , who rule either directly or through freely elected representatives, 
   you can not exclude the existence of god , but that the chance of this entity existing as we know of it in the abrahamic religions is extremely slim at best that 's silly . 
  the likelihood of god existing is the same as the likelihood of an abrahamic god existing . 
  the xistance of a soul like in jainism is not at all a more realistic or less realistic than a abrahamic soul . 
  buddhism is in no way more or less realistic than judaism . 
  well you just need to vote for a democracy . 
  thats not hard to do . 
  the problem is what happens when people vote for hitler . 
  that 's why the ideal shouldnt be a democracy but a rule of law state . 
  what we do n't understand is that democracy is n't achieved instantly democracy is created instantly . 
  rule of law takes time to create . 
  i thought paper can be recycled, 
  darn i should have known about wigner then . 
  another interesting mention would be then gelfand and his : [ unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/unreasonable_ineffectiveness_of_mathematics ) gelfand was russian though . 
  honestly if i hear '' phi phi phi phi '' then i assume it 's greek . 
  neah , i 'd get under the bus shelter , looks windy there . 
  and while getting off the bus id shout thank you.goodbye !, 
  so did * you * get one ? 
  also bosnia & h , kosovo and albania before them apparently :p . 
  but i would steal 500 miles and i would steal 500 more just to be the man who stole a thousand miles, 
  per capita the danes have the largest number of isis members in europe iirc . 
  she was using her irish accent to buy hair bleach . 
   every country had its dialects but they are pretty much everywhere slowly dying out in favour of the standardized languages . 
  meh you fail to understand how much the french govts went with a steamroller to remove the dialects . 
  france used to be like current day spain . 
  spanish is just castillan but other langyages are also powerful . 
  erdos is a famous mathematician that went around from house to house of friends and other mathematicians to write papers with them . 
  hugely productive that there 's an erdos number ( from which the bacon number is derived ) . 
  he worked a lot in number theory , szilard worked on the a bomb and told einstein to write that letter to fdr ( saying a program to build a bomb should start ) teller was the father of the h bomb and all around asshole . 
  polya famous mathematician that again worked on number theory , group theory . 
  riesz famous mathematician whose most theorem ( with frechet ) is the representation theorem in hilbert spaces ( how to identify hilbert dual spaces with itself ) . 
  i cant ely5 sorry but if someone can that would be awesome :d the rest , uhm i 'm at a blank, 
  many languages are layered like that in different strata . 
  that is by no means unique to french . 
  spanish has heavy influences from arabic . 
  basically all words starting with al. 
  about 8 % of the words .
