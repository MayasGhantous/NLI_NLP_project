  between large cities though , one would usually take the high speed trains . 
  long distance normal trains are called intercit\u00e9s ( used to be called corail but apparently they changed the name ) . 
  you also have some sleeper trains . 
  regional trains are called ter . 
   it 's the 6 hour lunch break :p excuse us for not wanting to eat a sandwich in front of a computer . 
  instead favoring social connections that create bonds between team members . 
  that makes us have fewer bs team building activities . 
   the state owns all the infrastructure and buildings through network rail and maintains it , with only the actual operation of the locomotives and rolling stock themselves franchised to private companies for x amount of years before being put out to tender again ( and for about 5 years , a state company operate a franchise until the conservative government put it back to a private company to operate ) . 
  that 's what they 're doing in france too with sncf r\u00e9seau managing the network , state owned and sncf that should be a company . 
  but it 's all for show . 
  honestly i very much appreciate our rail network . 
  fast service , good times over large distances . 
  130 euros ? 
  that 's it ? 
  worth it . 
   with the exception of britain , which entirely privatized its railways in the 1990s , most eu countries have limited deregulation to the pace set by common accord at european union level , starting with freight in 2006 and a few cross-border links thereafter . 
  if it goes like anything uk did , then the strike is a good thing . 
   she was brought to the us on a k-1 ( fiancee ) visa . 
  nope . 
  it was a k-9 cuz she was a bitch . 
  no need to be passive aggressive about it though . 
   submarines sous-marins . 
   drogi is expensive and dear in polish . 
  cher in french . 
  but why ? 
  in france only le pen wants to leave . 
  so theresa may = = marine le pen ? 
  what 's the context for this ? 
   if you do that , then you are either saying southern slavs aren ' slavs , or northern slavs are n't slavs . 
  you have to exlude one of the two groups , because they do n't converge genetically at all . 
  bulgarians et all had a long ass period of intermingling with balkan people . 
  same for the others . 
  trade was kinda big in that period , so the genetic diversity increased and they diverged from the slavs in the north . 
   in reality , historically the term `` slav '' comes from word `` slovo '' - literary `` word '' , and denotes simply people who speak the same , who use similar words . 
  yeah it 's well known that people who speak the same language are n't related . 
   ike the hungarians and lithuanians , share more ethnic connection to the northern slav group than those do to the southern slav . 
  amazing , people that are close together share genes compared to people who are apart . 
  strange aint it ? 
   your own data disproves it by showing half of the slavi-speaking nations are not genetically connected with the other half , whilst both groups have non-slavic speaking nations that are close to them genetically , making the use of `` slavic '' for anything other than linguistics a nonsense . 
  dude i 'm ending this conversation because it 's simply silly . 
  genetics simply disagrees with you . 
  the poles are , genetically , more closely linked to belorussians and russians than with germans . 
  that kind of separation makes no sense . 
  between a bulgarian and a portuguese there 's a big difference . 
  and there are way more many connections between a slovene and a polish than between a polish and a finnish . 
  and the irish waaaay more close to the bretons from bretagne than to you guys . 
   how about just leave the term `` slavic '' to linguistics and use what was called on your own map for genetics - central and eastern indo europeans ? 
  well that 's not how it works . 
  you are rewriting history to your own vision of things . 
   in the respective y dna haplogroups , whereas the hungarians and partly austrians and baltic nations are , despite not belonging to the `` slavic '' linguistic group . 
  things are n't discrete . 
  they do n't divide into 100 % austrian vs 100 % polish . 
  that 's why nationalism is retarded . 
  we 're all a mix but the concentrations differ . 
  in this case , the polish are western slavs while the russians are eastern . 
  see : it shows percentages , it 's not 100 % again check this graph https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_r1a#/media/file:distribution_haplogroup_r1a_y-dna.svg, 
  not really . 
  nothern french are non med yet we still do n't call ourselves northerners . 
   this woman has african ancestry , this other european and this third woman has asian ancestry . 
  yes and if you have blue eyes it is super likely that your mom and dad also had blue eyes . 
  that does n't make you a different race , does it ? 
  how is this relevant to the discussion : `` what is race ? '', 
  with scientists replying : ya know it 's not a very important thing . 
  dude , it 's not me , it 's them . 
   `` slavs '' is n't an ethnic , genetic or racial group . 
  well look at the y dna haplo groups in europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y-dna_haplogroups_in_european_populations#/media/file:haplogroups_europe.png  it 's a linguistic one not it 's an ethno-linguistic distinction . 
  ethnic meaning they have common origins . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs and also similar genetics as you can see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs#genetics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:distribution_haplogroup_r1a_y-dna.svg haplogroup r1a . 
  while the scandinavians are l1 mostly . 
  dude let 's not rewrite history now . 
  well when someone tells me northern european i think many do think scandinavian . 
  dude i do n't have a degree in biology . 
  do you ? 
  then let 's let people who know more do the talking . 
  crazy i know . 
  doesnt matter . 
  the poles are n't scandinavians . 
  usually when people say northern europeans they refer to scandinavians . 
  the polish are actually slavs . 
   are n't considered white or european anymore from what i 've learned by whom ? 
  also race ( black white etc ) is n't a scientific concept . 
   ar more than they do northern europeans , as in this case poland . 
  nothern europeans do n't really ressemble polish people . 
  hey we 're not doing as bad as one might expect . 
  score settling . 
   calling the afd far-right is also pretty dumb . 
  they are rightwing at best . 
  you probably consider them leftist . 
  for anyone . 
  what ? 
  that 's not coherent . 
  also at least 2 french terries took the refugee route to come back, 
  eh it 's not like the north does n't often view the south as lazy , loud , in your face , irresponsible . 
   times change and new powers rise quite fast and but decline takes a while . 
  how is that new though ? 
  the roman empire managed to be a world power fairly quickly and stayed for 1500 years . 
   kinda crazy to realize the most powerful country in the world is only just over 200 years old . 
  why is that so weird ? 
  the mongol conquest , alexander 's empire , the roman empire too happened very quickly .
