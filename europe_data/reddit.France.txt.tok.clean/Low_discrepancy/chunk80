  we already let in salty countries ( greece , poland ) that can not stop mentioning ww2 , we should stop doing that . 
   maybe serbs are questioning whether or not the money is worth joining the eu if the only reason you want to join the eu is money , then yeah , the eu is not for you . 
  the laws already exist . 
  we should apply them . 
   do you think france should try to censor the internet like germany does ? 
  do you think we should n't ban child pornography that is on the internet , because it is on the internet ? 
  how about doxxing ? 
  how about slander ? 
  why should the laws that exist concerning child pornography still apply but the laws concerning hate speech should not ? 
   you 'll see stories of people who lost coverage how did that happen ? 
  was is in states where the governors refused to accept fed government money to fill in the gap between those that can not get medicad and those that can not get obama care ? 
  because yeah , you have elected leaders that refused money because it 's dirty socialist money . 
  smart ? 
  very very stupid . 
   . nevermind the fact that the only reason healthcare is so expensive here in the first place is artificial inflation due to federal subsidies from earlier healthcare bills ( medicare and medicaid ) . 
  are you trolling man ? 
  because france has waaay better health care than the us and it costs less ( half as much iirc ) . 
  but hey , for the rich you have the best health care in the world , which i wo ' t argue with . 
  it is true . 
   we still have nothing close to socialized medicine . 
  a step closer is better than a step further . 
   small government , fewer taxes , state 's rights , less government interference in people 's personal and professional lives . 
  yeah . 
  we call that individualism . 
  http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/poll-serbias-complex-attitude-towards-eu-311141 54 % want eu integration , while 40 % have a negative image of the eu . 
  those types of numbers would be normal after 10 years of being in and people taking things for granted . 
  they 're not normal for someone that has yet to go through the hoops of joining . 
  we already have countries that wan na be left alone , countries that are us puppets , we dont want russian puppets too . 
  sometimes enough is enough . 
   but that 's not why the majority of republican constituency votes for them . 
  well what do people vote for ? 
  the amount of sh * t somethi ' g as obvious as obamacare got was friggin amazing . 
  lets face it , for the most part the us sees europe as socialist and europe sees the us as individualist . 
  it 's kinda true . 
  i personally think it would be a mistake to let serbia join the eu . 
  heck even they do n't want to . 
  well they are n't to their pre ww2 levels . 
  i do n't want my country to become like those ee countries where you 'd visit around and say : oh this used to be a jewish neighborhood , this used to be a jewish cemetery . 
  some things are simply not admissible and i do n't care what your beliefs on free speech are , dieudonn\u00e9 and jm le pen can go suck a dick . 
  a lot of extreme right wing people tend to be disenfranchised . 
  they also want a strong powerful goverment ( that 's their main gripe ) they also like social security . 
  in europe we 're not temporarily embarrassed millionaires . 
   is that supposed to be an answer ? 
  well look at the friggin data : http://cahiersdugretha.u-bordeaux4.fr/2010/2010-13.pdf between 1901-1915 there was : * 1901-1905 : 271.493 * 1906-1910 : 301123 * 1911-1915 : 325317 that 's 900.000 italian immigrants in a span of 15 years . 
  that 's pretty significant . 
   one instance . 
  one . 
  oh maybe there were a few more accidents , so what ? 
  it comes to show that no , us europeans we are not equal . 
  our current love we have for each other because we 're all white and christian is just a very recent thing . 
  our grandparents would have very very very different upbringings . 
  the way we see syrians now is the way they would see italians then . 
   did we commit terrorist attacks killing hundreds of french citizens on multiple occasions ? 
  you did kill the french president . 
  thanks for that btw ...

  you dont present facts , you present your impressions . 
   i do n't believe this to be true  they seem to spend most of their time that 's your belief , you are entitled to one . 
  i debate around facts . 
   from their actions i do n't believe this to be true . 
  that 's your personal belief . 
  i dont debate feelings . 
   it matters that italian immigrants had a similar culture and values to native populations . 
  did you miss the part were ** we lynched italian workers ** ? 
   no seriously , how is 1.6-1 .7 million people over 38 years comparable to 1 million in one year with many more to come what was the population of france at the time man ? 
  of italy ? 
   counting that france and italy share a common religion , a border and have a similar culture ? 
  did you miss the part where we lynched italian workers ? 
   remind me again , did italians threaten to come in the millions over a short period of time ? 
  yup . 
  for example the flux of italian immigrants between 1876-1914 is estimated at 1.6-1 .7 million people . 
  when france had a population of 40 million . 
  so imagine the syrian crisis only 4 times as worse . 
  and after 1914 : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/diaspora_italienne_en_france there were 451k italians in france in 1921 . in 1931 there were 800k . 
   did they come from a culture incompatible with that of the french ?
