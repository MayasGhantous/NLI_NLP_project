  it 's not ** even ** one cause . 
  unless you 're a member of isis and think in terms of sykes picot . 
  is anyone here from isis ? 
  how exactly did `` the french '' fuck up in syria ey ? 
  they 're bombing isis . 
  honest to god some people have the wits of a door knob . 
  did hungary express any desire to leave schengen ? 
  yup the french caused syria and they made merkel open the flood gates . 
   then fighting back at any means is the only solution . 
  `` fighting back '' ? 
  or are they lashing out ? 
   i think reality is getting so ridiculous that you 're instinctively calling bullshit , but no , it 's the truth . 
  is it bad to be sceptical ? 
  there are arguments for and against it being real . 
  i do n't mean if the piece of paper exists . 
  it does . 
  i mean if it 's actually from an arab . 
  cuz honestly why would an arab use the latin alphabet . 
  from my experience there are 2 types of news that are always bs : * i am the child of x ( with x ranging from hitler to the romanov ) * i found this amazing piece of paper that explains so much about society ( from the waitress that had racists at her red lobster , to the waitress that had homophobes at her restaurant to whatever ) . 
  the act of sexual abuses and rape were sufficiently despicable . 
  is this in any way factual or is it just some elders of sion thing ? 
  prosecuted not persecuted :p, 
   all in or all out . 
  none of this silly half half thing . 
  kinda like how that scotland referendum solved the issue once and for all and no one is talking anymore about it ? 
  cameron can not get people on board for his `` no moar benefitz for e. europeans '' . 
  doubt he 'll manage to convince anyone for bigger eu changes . 
   i think if the uk votes to stay in the eu after our referendum we need to finally stop tip-toeing around the eu and start becoming a second major voice never going to happen . 
  uk does n't want to lead . 
  it wants to be left alone . 
  so if catalonia becomes independent , do we get to close pur borders with them ? 
   , the humanity is not divided simply into two nations of `` poles '' and `` non-poles '' yes but if the ukranians desire a nation , they should have it , do n't you think ? 
  and the map post 1918 was a bit unfair to them . 
   but let 's not fool ourselves that stalin did those land grabs because he was motivated by some sort of fair distribution of borders . 
  well i was surprised to listen to hitler 's convesation with mannerheim : from this site : http://www.feldgrau.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=13647  because i always had one fear : that russia would suddenly assault romania in late autumn , and would annex the petroleum sources ... and we would have been not finished yet in late autumn 1940 . 
  if russia had occupied the romanian petroleum sources  it would have been impossible to line up before the spring of 1941 , and if now the russian , back then in the autumn of 1940 , had occupied rumania , and had annexed the petroleum sources , then we would have been ... err ... helpless in the year 1941 and now he 's talking about his convo with molotov :  and only on the visit of molotov [ now i 'll skip a few lines ]  ... i said : ` i do not think that it is directed against you , because you do not have the intention to assault romania , do n't you ? 
  tell me ... we never have heard that you have the intention to assault romania , you have always stated that bessarabia belonged to you , but you have never stated that you wanted to assault romania . ', 
  he said that he wanted to know precisely ... '' it is a bit confusing but the reality is that at the time , russia trully believed that bessarabia belonged to them ( which is of no suprise since it was part of the russian empire for 100 years -1812 - and it had been on and off occupied by them since 1711 . 
  why did n't the russians overtake romania fully , they had the power and they did just that in 1945 . 
   when stalin drew a line on the map between north and south bukovina he took in large parts of romanian-inhabited territory . 
  again , its stalin we 're talking about here . 
  between stalin being 100 % in the wrong and 100 % staling being in the right , there 's a just middle point . 
  while he took regions south of cernauti that were occupied by romanians , we can agree that cernauti should n't have been part of romania . 
  and romania also took parts inhabited by ukrainians yet no one is talking about the `` evil ferdinand '' ( nor should they ) . 
  romania also took regions in the west occupied by hungarians in their majority . 
  oradea was a hungarian town at the border , but still it went to romania . 
  there is a belief amongst the romanians that northern bukovina was stolen . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  it was n't fair , but these things rarely are . 
   but that its political leaders , representing the majority of the population , had voted as such . 
  yes the famous political leaders of bugeac . 
  how many of them do you know ? 
   so no , stalin was not in the right to take ** i never said it was a correct move to take bessarabia ** . 
   so now , in the interwar years romania was not a 100 % ethnically pure romanian state and nobody claims that . 
  well in the 90-00s the 3rd largest party was one called greater romania . 
  the romanian national day is the 1st of december . 
  [ long live chubby romania ] ( http://www.realitatea.net/traiasca-romania-dodoloata-relatarea-lui-lucian-blaga-de-la-marea-unire-din-1918_1064258.html ) became part of the mythos and was a cute little expression . 
  yet never is it mentioned the actual demographics was a bit wanky in northern bukovina for example . 
  or that bugeac was n't really romanian . 
  am i wrong to say that in east poland they 're a minority ? 
  in tarnopol there 's a center where they 're a majority , but that 's not the part that is connected to romanian . 
  the map is misleading a bit because unless the poles are under 10 % , everything is a shade of red :p also there'a majority in the north eastern part . 
  in the byalistok region . 
  we can see it closely follows this map : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/poland1937linguistic.jpg and could you confirm that those eastern regions are the ones occupied by the soviets in 39-40 ? 
  i dunno about poland , but romania rarely ever mentions the fact that northern bukovina or budjak should n't have been part of greater romania . 
  it 's obvious that poland also got territory that it was n't its to occupy . 
  check out gerrymandering . 
  it 'll blow your mind : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerrymandering and this : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/malapportionment#malapportionment, 
   apparently russia allways wanted to control mouth of the danube , well that 's kinda pointless since the danube goes right through romania . 
  and russia never asked to control the whole delta . 
  and now the point is moot because of the danube-black sea canal . 
  romania was indeed chubbier back in the day . 
  [ this 1930 ethnic map ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_romania#/media/file%3aromania_1930_ethnic_map_en.png ) based on census data will explain what will happen later : * the cadrilater ( south eastern part ) where the romanians are outnumbered by bulgarians and turks returns to bulgaria . 
  * northern bukovina where romanians are outnumbered by ukranians ( though they do not form the majority , except in the most northern parts ) , goes to the ussr ( in the name of ukrainians ) . 
  * bessarabia is yanked because it used to be part of the russian empire and is split in two parts . 
  the northern and eastern part form the moldavian ssr and the southern part : budjak where romanians are again the 3rd minority is attached to ukraine . 
  * szekely land ( the green part in the center ) currently wants autonomy . 
   well , it 's not really a coincidence that your country and poland are no longer our neighbors . 
  yes . 
  indeed . 
  and the reason it is not a coincidence is because those areas where poland and romania are touching were inhabited in their majority by ukranians . 
  lets take romania : the 1930 referendum shows that romanians are a minority and they 're outnumbered by ukrainians in storojinet and cernauti ( not the most romanian sounding names either ) . 
  and if you go in finer detail , you 'll see that the nothern part of northern bukovina was inhabited in its majority by ukranians . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_romania#/media/file%3aromania_1930_ethnic_map_en.png ( also bugeac - southern bessarabia-was not inhabited in their majority by romanians so why that area got included in romania - besides silly reasons like hey steve the great built a citadel there - but that 's another story ) now lets look at poland : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/mother_tongue_poland_1931_census.png this map of mother tongues shows that large areas of se poland were inhabited in ** majority ** by ukranians . 
  stanislawow ( where poland is touching romania in radauti and storijinet ) is inhabited by in 68 % by ukranians . 
  tarnopol ( where poland touched romania at cernauti ) it it inhabited 49 % by polish , 46 % by ukranians but if you look at the map , you see that only in the cities do polish outnumber ukranians , in the country side and in the south of tarnopol the majority are ukranian ) wolyn ( to the north of tarnopol ) is inhabited at 68 % by ukranians . 
  ** in conclusion ** : the corridor that connected romania and poland should n't have existed because it was inhabited in its majority by ukranians . 
  like it or not ( and as much as i hate to say it ) stalin was arguably in the right to claim that part of romania and poland for the ukrainians . 
  pepper spray yeah . 
  taser too but not the gun , the zapper you hold in your hand . 
  in a large crowd ? 
   ) dude take a chill pill . 
  we says we dont want to ? 
  france together with the uk are insuring the protection of the eu btw . 
  we 're being witty now . 
  so you 're saying it 's a european problem ? 
  huh who would have guessed ... 
   it 's basically escorting them through the entire country . 
  well france is n't a police state . 
  they do n't stop every car on the highway to see if there are any immigrants .
