  we also do n't teach creationism in any public school . 
  so that 's kinda good too , is n't it ? 
   they drive down the road to be a jailable offense . 
  yeah but you would n't give a jail sentence for that . 
  just like you wouldnt for trespassing . 
   why not make ramadan an official holiday then ? 
  because it 's not a holiday ... 
   into lorries and jail them for a year/6 months for committing what is obviously a crime you do n't put people in jail because they were on the motorway . 
  it 's not how it works . 
  you do n't make random laws . 
  plus jails are full atm . 
   i feel i must be missing something obvious . 
  yes you are . 
  we 're not living in a police state . 
   at least 24 hours of constant heavy rain have devastated the camp at grande-synthe near dunkirk , and volunteers say ** local officers are refusing to allow them access to the camp with supplies to rebuild it ** . 
  it 's in the article . 
   religious holidays are ok those are n't religious holidays . 
  they simply happen to coincide . 
  you do n't have to go to church or whatever . 
  i confess i confess , no one is perfect . 
   but the uk doing little is n't a good argument for france doing little aswell . 
  you are stating that france is n't doing enough . 
  i am proving you the contrary . 
  if the calais immigrants were willing to apply for asylum , it would take at most 3-4 months to process them since france does about 64k per year and they 're 18k . 
  but they dont want that , so that 's a bit of a pickle is n't it ? 
  what is the new exams fall during flying spaghetti monster month ? 
  is n't it easier to have a secular state ? 
  everybody 's equal . 
  their religion be it xtian , muslim , jewish etc does not matter . 
  i know uk loves traditions and tons of special rules and complicated stuff but does n't it get tedious at some point ? 
   i think that those need to be processed through the asylum system and should be granted proper asylum in france . 
  look at the 2014 numbers : http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/may/11/which-eu-countries-receive-the-most-asylum-seekers france was processing ** twice ** the number of asylum demands compared to the uk . 
   in the cases where they do n't tell you where they are from you could detain them . 
  okay . 
  now what ? 
  do they stay in prison for life ? 
  they already live in crappy conditions . 
  again it 's not a celebration , anymore than lent is . 
  it is a period of fasting , introspection etc etc etc. 
  if it were a holiday , id understand , but it 's something that lasts a month . 
  and people have been managing before this period . 
  they take it as a personal challenge . 
  they do n't expect being given an easier time . 
   widely celebrated holiday . 
  ramadan is not a holiday . 
  well the state has no business knowing my religion . 
   leave the country ? 
  uhm they do want to leave :p . and btw where do you send those that are syrian , lybian , afghani ? 
  those that say their passport got lost ? 
   these are religious holidays . 
  yeah but europe was pagan for a long while . 
  we ca n't erase that past , can we ? 
  so how is it that my french muslim colleagues managed to do it ? 
  are they some sort of uber muslims ? 
  in general their only request was to not be a dick and like eat in front of them but besides that we were golden ( and still are golden at work ) . 
  the majority of exams for school aged children are in the morning either way and muslims wake up earlier to eat . 
   yeah , secular state . 
  let 's have exams on christmas and easter . 
  i do n't want exams on the 1st of january either . 
  these have become secular celebrations since you are not forced to go to church . 
  churches are n't required to stay open . 
  ramadan lasts a moon month , it 's hardly comparable . 
  i am all for not giving exams on aid el fitr , but trying to avoid a month out of a year ... c'mon . 
   france is perfectly capable of processing a few thousand migrants , whatever the result may be . 
  yes . 
  and we do those numbers on a yearly basis . 
  ** but ** these people do n't want to apply for asylum in france . 
   its quite ridiculous and i really cant imagine something like this to happen anywhere else in europe . 
  well i hope so at least . 
  anti french circle jerking . 
  quelle surprise . 
   here in germany i would n't consider germany a secular state since the state collects religion taxes . 
   and i bet most people would be ok with accommodating the reduced productivity of fasting muslims during ramadan in return . 
  my muslims fasting friends do n't want to be treated differently . 
   france has holidays on easter , pentecost and christmas aswell as other christian holidays that has nothing to do with secularism . 
   it should be fairly doable for france to deal with 18k more . 
  heck even small sweden deals with ten times that france has offered 30k places for syrians in the next 2 years . 
  of course we can process them . 
  ** but ** the calais immigrants do n't want to apply for asylum in france . 
  if my flair bothers you , swap it with any other secular state ', 
  so you agree that until schengen is removed ( or each country deports immigrants outside the eu and does n't pass the peoblem to the next schengen country in line ) one can not actually solve the calais problem . 
  at most one can patch up things . 
   i do n't agree that france is not capable of solving calais though , if the french government were really determined they could how ? 
  how do you stop immigrants going from italy to calais without putting border controls in place at the franco-italian border ? 
  it 's a constant flux of immigrants arriving . 
  you solve the current batch of immigrants and others will arrive . 
  neah man . 
  just like with the thousands and thousands of immigrants that drowned in italian waters , and people told italy : deal with it . 
  no solutions will be given by any single country since the issue is huge . 
  18k people . 
  calais is the result of schengen sadly . 
  they should try a secular state . 
  heard it 's pretty cool . 
  oh my a nitpicker . 
  you guys are so fun ... / s  who is aggressively one is aggressively patriotic when one diminishes people from other countries . 
   comment is chauvinistic . 
  the adjective here means that it displays the characteristics of being chauvinist . 
  why is that the case ? 
  lets see some definitions :  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/-ic so the suffic * ic *  a suffix forming adjectives from other parts of speech , occurring originally in greek and latin loanwords ( metallic ; poetic ; archaic ; public ) and , on this model , used as an adjective-forming suffix with the particular senses ** `` having some characteristics of '' ** ( opposed to the simple attributive use of the base noun ) ( balletic ; sophomoric ) ; `` in the style of '' ( byronic ; miltonic ) ; `` pertaining to a family of peoples or languages '' ( finnic ; semitic ; turkic ) . 
  like it or not , his comment had some characteristics of chauvinism .
