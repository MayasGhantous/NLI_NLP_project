  you do n't get to show how open minded you are by classifying a whole group of people that simply share some origins as lazy , dead culturally etc etc etc. 
  and hey we can be even more nitpicky : are the walloons chauvinist ? 
  does that mean they really really like belgium and all belgians ? 
  why are the flemish complaining then ? 
  walloonia is n't a `` patrie '' so a walloonian can not be patriotic . 
  see , kinda annoying to be nitpicky . 
  well the person that wrote that comment ** is ** chauvinistic . 
  do i need to explain every comment ? 
  but just out of curiosity at what point it becomes treason ? 
  for example the young frenchmen fighting in syria and wishing the french state would disappear and maybe be replaced by an islamic state . 
  they are french just as the minister you cite is belgian . 
  they wish the elimination of the state just like that minister . 
  what is the essential difference ? 
  is it the violent nature of the french islamists ? 
  what if things turn violent in case of an elimination of the belgian state ( lets say the walloons will start to violently oppose the destruction of belgium , who will be the traitor in such a case ? ) . 
  is a traitor simply the person that opposes the majority ? 
   wallonia is one big welfare state filled with ** chauvinist people ** who refuse to work and ca n't or refuse to speak dutch . 
  oh the irony . 
   despite all of this , never in the history of belgium has a single bullet been shot due to the internal conflicts we have . 
  so at what point does a comment of the type :  i wish this country i am governing would disappear forever . 
  go from `` self determination guys yoohoo '' to a treasonous statement ? 
  obvious troll is ... 
   from a cynic point of view the paris terror attacks ** were a good thing ** for charlie ebdo we 're arguing that if it was a good thing or not . 
  since the creative heads are no longer there , that one of the good artists that survived : luz , left , and that the people still left are arguing over money , then no , it was n't a  good thing, 
   why the fuck kids should n't see a porn ? 
  why do n't you try then ... go in a park with your laptop and start approaching kids . 
  cuz it 's not a good idea to show kids porn ? 
  we do n't allow ** any ** porn at all in primetime . 
  i really have a hard time understanding your comments . 
   i know that i never heard well just because you heard about it now , does n't mean much because you ( and people outside of france ) are not the audience . 
  french people buy the newspaper . 
   i never intended any kind of disrespect and i definitely do n't know their current state . 
  if you think my post was anything else than that ... 
  neah i dont care :p . it 's not like i personally knew the guys . 
   sales have tripled their pre-terror levels , those sales come from france . 
  i doubt there are many french people that have n't heard of charlie hebdo . 
  and some buy it to help out i guess . 
  they must have gotten a subscription after the attacks . 
  the point is : no ch is n't doing better and the attack sadly did n't help . 
  i heard that the morrocans did inform french intel that abaaoud was in france but his exact whereabouts was discovered after a phone was found in a bin . 
   very true in the same time have you any idea of the current state of charlie hebdo ? 
  then why comment ? 
   from a cynic point of view the paris terror attacks were a good thing for charlie ebdo , it went from a niche paper with moderate sales to being known worldwide considering that what 's left of ch is breaking up , luz has left the paper . 
  and that many of the creative heads were killed during the attack , what you said is pure bs . 
  it helped for a brief while in order to collect money for the family , but the paper is n't what it used to be . 
  one could mention the effect italian immigration had and the huge amounts of organised crime , mafia etc. 
   what i mind is that the state still takes money from me and that you ca n't buy equipment with bribes . 
  so that 's the problem with ** your ** health system and not with public health system . 
   you ca n't buy equipment with bribes . 
  neither can you buy equipment with a nice salary , but a nice salary is important in order to have a motivated staff . 
   in a globalised world , geography is not destiny . 
  so why are you people bitching about calais and illegal immigrants . 
  good luck to thomas pesquet . 
  what you and / u/eirenarch do n't understand is you guys live in countries with very underfunded medical systems and underpaid medical staff . 
  all your doctors can either stay in your countries and get paid a pittance or they can move to any western country were they 'll be accepted with open arms . 
  that bribe you are paying is simply a way for those doctors to make a semblance of living wage . 
   nor you can 100 % sure who went to middle east because of jihad . 
  as is now , you 'll have jihadists returning what do you mean you ca n't know where someone is ? 
  what are our intelligence services doing but trying to determine who 's there and who is n't . 
  just like with the nazis , you can send them to trial after things calm down . 
   but i 'm pretty sure you ca n't imprison them for going to participate in jihad . 
  so murder becomes legal because jihad ? 
   the government offers free dutch lessons as long as you 're from the eu . 
  if you 're from outside the eu you have to pay . 
  maybe that organisation gets money from the eu . 
  also in the eu , citizens get some priviledges that are shared amongst us . 
  needs based scholarships are n't given to non eu citizens in france . 
   i 'm absolutely not a fan of surveillance and an expanded security state but this is not the only issue here . 
  france seems to have trouble guarding against threats which are already known . 
  did you bother reading what happened during the attack at charlie hebdo ? 
  she was with her child at the time , after picking her up from kindergarten . 
  2 ) charb did have an armed policeman that was with him at all times . 
  he complained about it and did apply for a gun permit so he could be left without the patrol . 
  it is true that another policeman that was in charge with protecting charb was n't present at the time . 
  3 ) they attacked with ak-47 assault rifles and had bullet proof vests . 
  4 ) the guard that was with charb got killed , so did one of the security people in the building . 
  a street policeman was also shot and a police car was also shot . 
  all in all it lasted about 10-15 minutes ( if i 'm not mistaken ) . 
  so unless you put armed military , there 's not a shit ton you can do . 
  but hey , hindsight is 20/20, 
  it 's because they dont put the / s tag . 
  honestly it 's like the internet is full of sheldons . 
   the only difficulties in building it are in creation of isotopes and having access to them and also the technology used for constrution so you know how to build a super fast centrifuge that can separate uranium flouride ? 
  and fission bombs have a maximum yeild of about 700 kilotons . 
  hardly impressive . 
  i call you kiddo because you act immature . 
  you refuse to comprehend a ) the complexities of creating a uranium bomb b ) the complexities of making a plutonium bomb c ) the complexities of making a hydrogen bomb . 
  and even if you go for any of the 3 , you refuse to understand the complexities in delivering such a bomb . 
  you do n't build icbm or slbm in 5 minutes . 
  add to that the fact that you have to develop everything without any actual test , so you need a bunch of super computers to perform all the complex simulations . 
  there 's a reason why the most powerful french super computers are at our nuclear researvh center . 
   i 'm yet to have engineering degree too call me when you get one . 
   we both did n't studied a nuclear technology yeah . 
  but my professors included the deputy director of the armed nuclear program in france . 
  i 'm betting he 's a wee bit knowleadgable than you are kiddo . 
  but i have an engineering degree and by talking to some experts in those fields , i do understand the complexities . 
  unlike you . 
   every 15 year old can build a nuke oh god . 
  dude , your lack of knowledge on this topic is baffling . 
  if you wan na troll , be a little more original .
