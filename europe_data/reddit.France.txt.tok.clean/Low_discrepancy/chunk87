  indeed . 
  those countries have successfully integrate the white immigrants . 
  natives were screwed in both countries . 
  oh and blacks in the us ... that 's a spectacular fuck up . 
  but hey 14 % of the population ? 
   money doesnt really matter for a nation like france . 
  unemployment is at an all time high . 
  trust me , money is a big issue . 
  nobody want 's to live worse than their parents . 
   if keeping your rights isnt worth a few billion to you , well then i really dont know what to say anymore . 
  you are assuming schooling and social programs will help fix the problem . 
  those already exist . 
  if you study well enough you can have a basically free education . 
  the problem happens at home . 
  if your parents dont give a shit about you and you spend all your time with local rift raft , nothing good comes of it . 
  france had a policy of building shitty communist style housing . 
  for the first gen immigrants it worked . 
  they moved from not having even a toilet in their house , to indoor plumbing and heating . 
  their situation improved . 
  for their kids that was n't the case . 
  the problem is that it 's too expensive to build little villas for everybody ( only a slight exaggeration ) . 
  the kids are also left on their own , and we get into situations with poor integration . 
   its done with education , schools , social programs and sensible immigration policies . 
  the reality is : there 's not a lot of money . 
  these are essential to insure the independence of our intelligence/sigint units, 
  i have read good comics in french , though . 
  where do they come from ? 
  if you 're from se or ee , everytime you come back from visiting your parents , you bring a ton of food : salamis , sausages , prosciutto , zakuska . 
  stinks up trains . 
  ps : your mileage might vary depending on how well off your parents are . 
  is that the slovenian cousin of jason mraz ? 
  well only in finland would you not hug santa because that 's invading private space . 
  they 're taking our lottery winnings !, 
  after ww1 ukranians got super effed with regions that were in their majority ukranian annexed by poland or romania . 
   canal + used to be great , even a little subversive , that 's that national tv , that 's cable . 
  france 2 , 5 m6 or arte are ok . 
  should n't you start doing some melting then ? 
  because it just looks like it 's crystallising . 
  this is why you dont ask belgians non-sensical questions . 
  they give non-sensical replies . 
  gim me a call when atheists build camps to pray the gay away out of poor kids or abuse them straigh . 
  you 're just pissy cuz you read a comment you did n't like . 
  nobod tortured you like these gay kids http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1734-5-things-i-learned-at-pray-away-gay-camp_p2.html, 
  duly noted . 
   you have to overwrite the entire empty space on the disk to be sure all your data truly disappears . 
  you have to overwrite it multiple times too . 
  it 's a hassle . 
  i wonder if the linux command * shred * actually helps . 
   i absolutely agree , still `` race card '' is used too often lately , by some people , can you give 5 situations , in your day to day live , where the race card was used and you simply had to say ( at least in your mind ) : geesh enough with this bs ? 
  one of those rare cases when the whole is less than the sum of its parts . 
  why obviously there 's no way to check if former partner deleted the photos , at least someone posting revenge porn can not use the `` they stole it from me excuse '' .

  if a homosexual dies mid co\u00eftus , you can bet the church wont give him any funeral . 
  bulgaria i dunno , but there are problems in the timok valley between the serbian authorities and romanian minorities . 
   this study smells of bias . 
  from my time in romania that dates a decade a go , such a comparison would be factual . 
  there 's no love between romania and hungary . 
  romania and serbia ? 
  there 's the problem with the minorities in timok valley . 
  romania and ukraine ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bystroye_canal that caused a huge fuss . 
  also some island in the middle of nowhere . 
  romania and bulgaria ? 
  i have no idea there . 
  maybe between romania and the black sea there 's some love . 
  romania actually does n't have cordial relations with any neighbors . 
  that 's how a society improves :  hey the last guys did it too !, 
  hey it 's okay if you random citizen get buttfucked , because the previous govt buttfucked you too . 
  it 's only fair to not cock block the current govt . 
  they probably apply the : all males between the ages of 16 and 65 are considered enemy combattants .

  in a formal/formalish setting where saying the name is relevant because you present your full identity ( e.g. 
  business meetings , phone calls to people that do n't know you/don ' t recognize your voice ) , usually it 's last name -  first name ( like the hungarians ) . 
  saying it the other way round would seem too familiar and pretentious . 
  but usually in news papers when talking about well known people it 's the classic first name -  last name .

  it 's like he suffered a stroke or something . 
  say hello to my little friend .

  googled this .

  one of the best types of degrees in the scientific area are engineering degrees from grandes ecoles . 
  ( they even beat any type of masters degrees ) . 
  to prepare of that degree , you go into a classe pr\u00e9pa which is 2-3 years after hs .
