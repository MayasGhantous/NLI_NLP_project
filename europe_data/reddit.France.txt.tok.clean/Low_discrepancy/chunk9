  so uhm ... why is a single organisation handling ** all ** of that ? 
  wtf ? 
  that could be a major corruption/colluding issue/price fixing issue . 
  and considering that romania has n't qualified for shit since 08 ... 
   i personally do n't care at all for this contest but , why does it only have to be about making short-term money ? 
  because romania has bigger fish to fry ? 
  romania bled 1/3rd of its medical workers who left to we . 
  they get vastly underpaid . 
  paying 14 million for something so frivolous as a kitsch song contest ** is objectively stupid **  ( especially if they win , then they can host it and disprove certain stereotypes and make a good impression to the outside world ) are you serious ? 
  fuck me this is ridiculous . 
  yes eurovision dispelled all stereotypes about ee because last year i got to see polish chicks with big jugs singing songs with sexual innuendos . 
  honestly when finland won it was because it was a giant middle finger to how tacky eurovision is . 
  14 million for that piece of stinky shit ? 
  romania got my respect for that . 
  eurovision overbilled . 
  they asked for 14 million accumulated debt since 2007 . 
  14/10 years = 1.4 million considering that only 1.2 million watched the show ... you do the maths . 
  0.5 million of profit would be a wet dream . 
  eurovision better ask for a lot less or they 'll get squat . 
  yeah it 's a national tv station . 
  but still , they overbilled . 
  14/10 years = 1.4 million per year . 
  considering that only 1.2 million people watched the show last year , no way they could generate sufficient revenue from ads . 
  either way , no way romanian tv could ever make that much money from the eurovision . 
  1.2 million watched it last year . 
  that would probably generate 0.5 m from ads ( wet dream estimations ) . 
  and they ask for 14m ? 
  that makes 0 sense . 
  it would take 30 years to pay them back . 
  communism fell 27 years ago . 
  they overfilled their service , so eurovision can go pound sand . 
   1/5 of all romanians watch the show , hahahah . 
  1 in 15 romanias . 
  and that was considered a good score every romanian watching would have to pay 10 euros . 
  good fucking luck with that . 
  they made a simple calculation and realised they 'd pbbly generate at most 500k . 
  why pay 15m and only get 0.5 m out of it ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  think he 's mostly anti-european . 
  ca n't blame him.he grew up in indonesia . 
   bremainer if that 's the word you wan na use , it 's better you leave, 
  he simply understood politics without getting emotional.of course he had the interest of france above all else but his analysis of situations was clear . 
  he was close friends with macmillan yet he still refused him what he wanted even when things got emotional . 
  and do n't think it 's some sort of anti-anglophone sentiment . 
  he was called to fix the algerian war and even though france technically won it ( or began controlling everything ) he pulled out of algeria even though it meant great sacrifices . 
  1 + million french living in algeria that really did not want to leave ( think of it like the afrikaaner ) had to rejoin the continent . 
  they and their descendants still profoundly hate de gaulle and france lost its colonies but darn it was the right thing to do . 
   the cultural difference is far greater , and the uk has twice the gdp/cap . 
  ah yes the famous british cultural products : hooligans , chavs and the magnificent city of birmingham . 
  god man , no ee country could ever hope to top that . 
  it would probably have been from the romanian national tv station budget which is already stretched thinner than french fries in 1870s ireland . 
  they probably calculated how much revenue eurovision would generate , realise it would never come close to 14 million so they passed . 
  seems like the smart idea . 
  honestly , thanks to those american soldiers in the thalis train . 
  they saved ** a fuckton ** of lives that day . 
  it could have been a blood bath without them . 
  per capita ? 
  i think they 're 3rd behind belgium and sweden . 
  and before france . 
  romania had to pay 14 million euros from past debts . 
  no way the tv stations can ever make that much money from ads on the eurovision or whatever . 
  that 's a lot of money for very little value . 
  romania defaulted which was the right thing to do . 
  i hope they wo n't be stupid to pay it in order to participate . 
  / u/copticsnare sounds like someone that never had to balance an account . 
  romania had to pay 14 million euros for that kitsch of a show ? 
  when they 're not even organising it , or anything ? 
  screw that , they made the right call . 
  no way the tv station could ever make that much money from ads to even break even . 
   but i 'm pretty sure she said multiple times that she was opposed to same sex marriage , at the beginning to pay lip service . 
  but considering that philippot , a gay dude , is her right wing man , she has dropped it . 
  heck a ton of `` normal '' right wing politicians like sarkozy , cope i think too were against the law , nkm did n't seem super excited about it ( and shewas running in paris , what \u00e0 dumbass ) . 
  but they was just bs . 
  they do n't give a shit and if they do , they 're for it . 
  and you have people at ump that are way more extr\u00eame on the issue than marine : wauquiez for example . 
  i honestly think she is n't bothered by this issue and she 's more than happy to see it go away . 
   so opposed to same sex marriage eh . 
  marine is n't really . 
  marion is . 
  one 's a republican the other a catholic . 
  marine avoided the manif pour tous like the plague . 
  getting out of europe . 
  massively reducing immigration of any kind ( except `` the qualified '' while ignoring that france has the 3rd highest number of foreign students - behind us & uk ) , national preference : no more aid/benefits/scholarships to foreigners . 
  mayor 's that are in her party have refused to give any more money to many humanitarian organisations , they also started to harass kebab shop owners ( wtf kebab is delicious ) , no drying your clothes outside ( fuck that it 's the south , it 'd hot , you got a free drier : even in friggin venice people dry their clothes in the sun ) . 
  oh and there 's the little matter of making a list of students with arabic first names ( that 's super illegal in france ) and refusing to fund cultural events like shows or concerts because of decadent art . 
  so they wan na regulate your behaviour , your diet , what art is and they make a list of minorities . 
  does that sound familiar to you ? 
   um , i absolutely can . 
  if i 'm paying the same ( or in many cases more ) amount as the us , i should expect a similar quality library . 
  i have no expectation . 
  i simply do n't pay . 
  if you were forced to pay that 'd be a different thing . 
   there should not be a difference that large as us netflix vs non us netflix . 
  different regions , different countries , different laws . 
  you ca n't expect netflix to jump through hoops . 
  resale value takes a bit . 
   i love how european have to spin a germany company getting caught red handed breaking the law as the us bullying the eu . 
  let 's put it this way . 
  gm produces a car with a problem that kills some 120 people . 
  they know the problems there but still do n't fix it .
