  you 're going off topic : namely the us should include romania and poland into its visa waiver program . 
  they are of no security threat to the us ( you can count the number of muslims from both countries that have joined isis on a hand probably ) but chooses to maintain them outside of the visa program simply because they fear some sort of ooooo spooky immigration waves . 
   seems the us is bolstering it 's allies in eastern europe more than most european members of the eu . 
  tell that to the 130 ** b ** illion euros given to poland . 
  ee has vastly benefited from the eu . 
  since joining the eu the gdp per capita in poland and romania nearly doubled . 
  also the eu pushed romania to fight corruption and we can see the results nowadays with a former pm , mps and ministers in jail for corruption . 
   when does france support its allies out of altruistic means ? 
  it opened its job market to ee countries that are in the eu . 
  it opened its benefits and aids to them . 
  a student from romania can freely come to france , apply for a needs based scholarship ( which is always given ) and be given sufficient money to live and study in france . 
  and no polish or romania soldiers died in wars that we 've wanted to wage just for the heck of it because hey we 're a super power . 
  the uk is n't expected to do anything . 
  it can fully close its borders to all traffic . 
  it is a sovereign country . 
   the us is trying to balance russia 's concerns and the fact it wants to move resources out of europe rather than in . 
  poor us . 
  of course you 're ignoring that the us wants bases in former warsaw pact countries specifically to mess with russia and that [ a former agreement between nato and russia ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/2015/11/25/minister-poland-wants-nato-russia-deal-scrapped/76395554/ ) means the us ca n't deploy those bases . 
  it 's the whole all mighty attitude . 
  yeah romania and poland are good enough to send soldiers in iraq to fight in your war and have their soldiers killed , but they 're rift raft and / u/belteshazzar89 is completely against lifting visa agreements for such states . 
  romania ... oh my ... that 's yucky . 
  ** my point is ** : the us likes to play the ally card but only when it 's in their advantage . 
  when not , well those allies can go screw themselves . 
   considering that you put your torture prisons in romania and poland that part ? 
  and i still fail to see how the us doesnt wan na put bases in ee . 
   and in many cases are actively lobbying for them . 
  for torture prisons ? 
  til . 
  and the us reluctantly gave in to the demands of those pesky ees, 
  since when is somalia a safe country . 
  are we being facetious ? 
   why whine about the us not wanting to take a blanket visa-free approach to romania ? 
  considering that you put your torture prisons in romania and poland , that you wan na put bases over there , that you had army stationed over there , it 's a bit of a dick move not to give them a visa waiver . 
   give up more local power to a federal entity and become one sovereign entity . 
  goddam it man . 
  no spoils . 
  thats illegal . 
   put most of them on a plane a plane to where ? 
  say you have a lybian that does n't want to apply for asylum , where do you send him ? 
   of course you can what do you mean ? 
  18k would be 25 % of the total number of prisoners in france atm . 
  where would you put them considering that our prisons are full ? 
   no , if he does n't apply for asylum he can be deported . 
  again , to where ? 
   if he 's from libya and is in danger he can apply for asylum . 
  and if he doesnt ? 
   but is n't the fact that they are on french territory without a visum already a violation of the law ? 
  yes . 
  and they wan na leave . 
  they already passed through italy and were n't arrested . 
  why ? 
  because they wanted to leave . 
  and if you go from italy to france , do you show any id ? 
   how many regions of france did they walk through ever heard of schengen ? 
  leaving schengen for france is a good idea . 
   he refuses he can be deported . 
  to where ? 
  what if he 's lybian or from a country that 's deemed not-safe ? 
  then you 're stuck . 
  uk might be favorable because every once in a while the bbc tells how they had to scramble typhoons because a a tupolev tu 95 is flying close to uk . 
   automatically allowing people to arrive visa-free to the us and then refusing them entry would be a terrible solution well that 's what you 're doing . 
  people whom you consider a threat are not allowed in . 
  it 's a good solution . 
  visa are not in place for security reasons and to believe that is childish . 
  they 're in place to avoid people overstaying their welcome . 
  bordeaux is not land locked . 
  tsk tsk tsk, 
  who 's peeing in its mouth : s ? 
  you can still refuse entry on us soil to eu citizens and you actively do . 
  so what 's the big problem ? 
  deyr tekkin er securiterr, 
  so it 's better for everyone then that europe is not a nuclear wasteland . 
  both were fucked up , one was worse and had it won , more tha ' a few millions would have died . 
  we can both agree that a hitlerian regime would have been far worse . 
  the end to what was a terrible event in the history of europe . 
  i guess we 're too quick to forget what war does . 
   since the only nations disrupting the momvement of eu nationals is france by closing its borders waiting in line a bit and being banned or removed from a country is not the same thing . 
   if you 're talking about eu citizens , then you have no case because switzerland benefits from the eu with erasmus for example . 
  europe 2020 is another example . 
  another example , the largely eu funded , 1.2 billion euro https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_brain_project i gave many other examples on how they benefit from the eu . 
   how to call it [ a bridge of sighs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bridge_of_sighs ), 
   i know , i did n't bother making a new account \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af same problem for / u/poincarre, 
  well hungary wins this roung beating uk . 
  the czech dont seem to care about having a nice building . 
  looks like an egg under a blanket . 
   ah , the bigotry . 
   assume you 're saying this in regards to switzerland , but then you are wrong because switzerland is not in the eu . 
  you assume wrong . 
  i was talking about any eu member . 
  conicidentally , syrian refugees in german care are not eu people and nowhere is it written that they have freedom of movement . 
  who 's talking about syrian refugees ? 
   the eu as a whole is more than just `` freedom of movement for labour and goods '' , and if you 're going to hang a damocles ' sword above the heads of these countries , saying : accept migrants , do x , do y or else , then you 're not searching for a solution , you 're making a threat . 
  somehow you decided that the complaints of these countries are invalid , and that because they benefit from x , that they should shut up and do as told . 
  ** we 're talking about eu citizens ** . 
  put your anti-eu anti-merkel pitchfork away and stay on the point of this thread if you expect any sort of reply . 
  so if you can do without eu workers and r&d more power to you . 
  how many of those efl professors are swiss and how many are foreign workers that appreciate the free movement of professors and students ? 
  how many are happy with having fewer international students come to their classes ? 
  how many are happy that those foreign students will have fewer opportunities on the job market because of the * pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence nationale * ? 
  it 's easy to brush away the foreigner and claim `` omg we 're so good , we can do it on our own '' .
