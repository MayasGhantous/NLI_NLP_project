  heck even your misspelt name : dirichlet was a german mathematician that has studied in paris under poisson and fourier . 
   we can presume that those values relate to science etc as someone that has spent 7 years in academia as a student now a phd student that also gives classes i can tell you that we 're some of the most open and accepting people you 'll meet . 
  any type of legislation that impedes free movement , that reduces the number of foreign students , reduces the opportunities of those foreign students because of national preference or whatever bs affects us deeply . 
   it relates to immigration generally of which r&d workers are part of . 
   there is zero reason whatsoever to think that r&d workers might be impacted . 
  http://news.sciencemag.org/europe/2014/02/swiss-vote-curb-immigration-could-hamper-research these people disagree . 
   this was the case before the referendum . 
  did you actually read the link i send ? 
  it starts with :  initiative populaire f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ` contre l'immigration de masse '  la constitution1 est modifi\u00e9e comme suit : popular federal initiative `` against mass immigration '' the ** costitution is modified with the following ** . 
  if you go to point 3 , it will be the statement i said in previous comments , namely * ** national preference ** * ** reduce immigration in any area they see fit ** i understand you probably dont speak french but at least try to google translate the link i offered . 
  it was their referendum to change the constitution . 
  they can limit in any area they see fit . 
  and i simply said cern should start moving operations abroad on the long term since the values represented by people working there are and of people working in r&d are not represented by the swiss . 
  personal emphasis , you can google translate it but the bold says there has to be a national preference and they can limit worker immigration in any area they see fit . 
  tomorrow they can decide that they dont want any eu researchers since it is not in the interrest of switzerland . 
  there 's no protection offered for r&d in the referendum . 
   would you accept criticism that france should n't be able to close its borders because schengen or that your martial law is undemocratic ? 
  schengen is not an eu project . 
  freedom of movement for workers is a profound eu and eea project . 
   why ? 
  because the countries refuse to ` fall in line ' ? 
  and in the end , why should an eu organization funded by the whole of eu care about a country 's stance on this or that issue . 
  that 's not their job . 
  huh ? 
  poland czech republic and romania are absolutely staying in line with eu policy : there should be freedom of movement for eu nationals and no discrimination for eu workers . 
  if they decide that movement of eu people should be limited ; consequences will happen . 
  you can not have your cake and eat it too . 
   the referendum was not a referendum saying that there should be no foreigners in switzerland at all . 
  it aims to reduce immigration through quotas . 
   the referendum was not a referendum saying that there should be no foreigners in switzerland at all . 
  where did i say that ? 
  are you strawmaning the issue ? 
   switzerland is just one of the vast majority of countries in the world , like france , germany and the uk , that allow some foreigners in but not others . 
  the swiss and uk want to reduce eu immigration . 
  that 's fine . 
  but why should my tax money go on research that will be carried out in switzerland or uk that can later decide okay yeah we dont want any eu researcher cuz `` deyr tekkin err jerbs '' /, 
   can clearly allow people who work for cern . 
  because cern is an international organisation . 
  therefore they can pussyfoot around the issue by saying well the person we 're employing isnt actually employed in switzerland . 
  why not offer more opportunities to countries that need them like eastern europe . 
  i am vastly in favor of opening new research institutes across europe . 
  and there was a referendum to reduce the number of immigrants . 
   the hadron collider 's already in switzerland . 
  it 's not a couch you can move one room over . 
  no but future investments ( consider the extreme light infrastructure that 's buildings some of the worlds powerful lasers in poland , czech republic , romania ) should be reconsidered . 
   these fields are about the betterment of mankind and should n't bow to ** petty politics . 
  ** petty politics like deciding to reduce the number of foreigners  http://news.sciencemag.org/europe/2014/02/swiss-vote-curb-immigration-could-hamper-research, 
   cern is not an eu institution . 
  and switzerland is full and founding member of cern . 
  bad example there . 
  but the vast majority of people who work at cern are foreigners . 
  switzerland voted to reduce the number of foreigners working on its soil . 
  i see a huge problem , dont you ? 
   http://news.sciencemag.org/europe/2014/02/swiss-vote-curb-immigration-could-hamper-research luckly cern isnt affected but other research institutes can . 
  considering that switzerland also voted to reduce immigration , maybe it 's time to reconsider some policies . 
  countries should be free to decide their future and eu nations so realise that . 
  there is no point for example to have cern in switzerland . 
  a country that can not accept foreigners should not benefit from having such essential , international institutions in such places . 
  hey maybe they 'll start debtor prison again, 
  same name different histories behind the terms . 
   has , but a party can win 28 % of the vote in french elections and walk away with nothing ? 
  huh ? 
  they 'll get 30 % of the seats in the regional council, 
  you do realise that ipads arent just a miracle . 
  you still need infrastructure to have a plug at every desk ( ma'am my ipad just died and i have all my hw on it ) . 
  also wifi equipped classroom . 
  and the amount of energy to power those things . 
  but ipads ? 
  how do they not improve teaching ? 
   ( including selling out her entire core grassroots supporters ) the racists ? 
   did n't seem like a very smart move to me . 
  her party is strongly the 3rd political power in france . 
  she threw her crazy dad under the bus and gained more votes than he has ever hoped . 
  ah yes . 
  the fine analyst you are . 
  her niece also lost but she said she is francaise de souche . 
  it 's almost like people dont vote according to one single thing . 
  amazing . 
  you can put lipstick on a pig , that doesnt make it more than just a pig . 
  republican is a common value . 
  it would be like having a political party la r\u00e9sistance . 
  you can think of jmlp and marion lp as being one actually . 
  marine is the politically smart one . 
  the communist party got 1.55 % of the votes last week . 
  how many votes does a communist party get in the elections in the us ? 
  if you check the results last week : the left parties received 36 % of the vote , the right wing parties 32 % and fn 28 % https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lections_r%c3%a9gionales_fran%c3%a7aises_de_2015#premier_tour_2 so it 's a surprise only if you look at the news that only talked about le pen . 
  sarko knows that who 'll be the candidate for the ump will win the election . 
  so either : * a ) sarko by miracle agrees with an open primary and by an even larger miracle outside the party will vote jupp\u00e9 * b ) the party breaks up . 
   so the `` mainstream '' morons do n't freak out , but deep inside they both know that they are on the same page . 
  well marion le pe says she 's francaise de souche ( because she has french grand parents ) . 
  got anymore theories ? 
   i just ca n't comprehend how a people can think that this is okay . 
  the term in question was first used in 1892 . 
  the republic is older than that . 
  also ask an american if they 're ethnically american . 
   to be told they do n't exist . 
  i guess if that 's what they want then they should n't exist . 
  the french exist . 
  if you have french grandparents , they exist , unless they 're dead . 
  then they dont exist anymore .
