   have a good nights sleep in your leftist dreams  well , as the law is now, 
  germany is in the eu . 
  it can not discriminante based on where their workers come from . 
  case closed . 
  we 're talking about the eu . 
  uhm , 36000 doctors left romania . 
  their primary destinations are germany , france , italy , spain . 
  you take the good with the bad . 
  you cant just take in qualified people and tell the unqualified to fuck off . 
  except if they 're pp for immigrants . 
   person of the year ( called man of the year until 1999 [ 1 ] ) is an annual issue of the united states news magazine time that features and profiles a person , group , idea or object that ** `` for better or for worse ... has done the most to influence the events of the year '' **, 
  the regions control some aspects in the financing of transportation , roads , education ( building schools ) , development funds , associations . 
  so they control how the money is spent basically . 
  the most notable thing would be removing the financing of associations . 
  marion le pen said she 'll stop funding lgbt organisations . 
   current president of france is a socialist from the socialist party hahahahaha hahahaha hhaaaa . 
  but we dont bowl . 
  cant be . 
  it 's on a map . 
  maps never lie . 
  are we actually offering those conditions ? 
  i heard only uk is doing it . 
  vs what honest politician ? 
  i didnt say marine was socially progressive . 
  i said that she is for giving a social net just for french citizens . 
  she does n't have a strong critique of the `` assistanat '' ( people on the down low getting help ) . 
  unlike her father for which the poor could go f themselves . 
  i did n't say fn is pro-gay . 
  i said that marine is much more pro-gay than the whole of fn and a chunk of ump . 
  just compare marine with wauquiez . 
  one 's a member of fn the other of ump . 
  since the law has been signed , havent heard many anti gay marriage comments from her . 
  also never seen her in the manif pour tous cortege . 
  lets not get in a debate about french colonialism and the algerian war . 
  have we seen marine ever walk in a protest against gay marriage ? 
  she 's going along the fait accompli line . 
  now compare that with marion 's line . 
  plus lets not forget that philippot is you know gay and very close to marine and the second man in the party . 
   at the last r\u00e9gionales , the socialists did really well and who was at power then ? 
  oh that 's right the populat leader sarkozy . 
   the right wing parties got a significantly higher score ( 27.9 % ) than the socialists ( 23.5 % ) that 's not correct . 
  you 're just comparing lr and ps . 
  thee are not the ring wing parties and the left wing parties . 
  excluding fn , the results are : * right wing parties : lr - udi - modem + dlr : ** 30.46 % ** * left wing parties : ps + communists + fg + greens ( because they have no other options ) : ** 37.18 % ** [ sauce ] ( http://election-regionale.linternaute.com/ ) . 
  considering that ps is as popular as a cold potato , that unemployment has n't been this high since 1997 , that before the attacks hollande was less popular than sarkozy in his worse moments , the left has done a good job per total . 
  france has swung to the right yes , but not to sarkozy 's right . 
  what left-wing propaganda ? 
  the biggest losers from this election were the right wing parties . 
  marine le pen sucked them dry . 
  i 'm telling you , turkey has to stay away from the kurds and all the problems they bring . 
  give'em their own country . 
  problem solved man . 
  did i go to sleep and wake up in 1856 again ? 
  anyone with half a brain would know not to use public networks . 
  they 're a major security risk . 
  there are two fns . 
  one current by marine that is more `` socially progressive '' . 
  pro-gay , pro-govt aids for poor french people . 
  this is popular in the north which is a poor region . 
  the other current is represented by her dad and is more similar to the tea party . 
  fuck gays and poor people . 
  this is popular in the south and now represented by marion , marine 's niece . 
  now lets look at rhe demographics of the south . 
  in the east ( cannes , nice ) you have rich old people moving here to enjoy their retirement . 
  you can guess how they vote in the west ( marseille ) , there are the pieds noirs . 
  these are europeans living in algeria that supported the colonial rule and had to leave . 
  fn was founded by a guy that fought in the algerian war and wanted to keep algeria inside the french empire . 
  so normally , the pieds noirs support fn these two demographics give birth to a big fn vote that has been happened for decades in the region . 
   the map represents every movement , no matter how small or insignificant like every information , it should have some degree of significance . 
  you can not compare separatist movements between them . 
  catalan is significant , corsican a bit let . 
  edit : we 're kind enough to show the reality of the terrain , which most likely you might not be familiar with . 
  yeah . 
  the south `` wanting '' independence is ridiculous . 
   does n't that preclude suicide bombers from being terrorists ? 
  no i dont think so . 
  i 'm no psychologist but for me there 's a difference between someone so indoctrinated that they 'd commit a suicide attack and someone that had a chemical inbalance or whatever that makes them crazy . 
  yup lets compare a country that has 4.5 million people with one that has 320 million . 
  and a gdp per capita 4 times smaller . 
  that 's smart , that 's very very smart . 
  we have the same here . 
  people refusing a minute of silence after the charlie hebdo attacks , saying that they deserved it . 
  people who think it 's a whole complotist plan by the jews . 
  uhm one of the terrorists got his documents taken from him so he does n't leave france . 
  he just went to the police afterwards and declared that he lost them . 
  got new ones and left for syria . 
  we have people coming back from syria and living a nice life here . 
  wtf !, 
  not saying that fn will fix it . 
  they 're super filled with bs . 
  but the whole laid back attitude towards extremists living amongst us brought us here . 
  man , you 're the gift that keeps on giving . 
  you are one funny ruskie . 
  if stating the facts and the obvious is circle jerk , then i am guilty of it . 
   before i grant you response on the subject . 
  if someone starts talking about the poor oppressed eastern ukrainians , i already tune out and stop giving a rats ass about their opinion . 
  they 're just peddling russian propaganda . 
  i am just calling our bluff in case some redditor that does n't know the actual situation starts reading your comment about poor eastern ukranians that wield heavy weaponty and their democratically elected leader . 
  someone should explain reddit to you . 
   every border between any countries what ?
