  in the schengen states , borders do not exist . 
  once you 're in a schengen state , you 're free . 
  that 's why the terrorist that 's on the lam went to hungary to pick up shady dudes . 
  yeah . 
  i sure expect those refugees to come through the bay of biscaye . 
  darn man you sure are reaching hard . 
  too hard . 
   these people in the eastern ukraine were denied their constitutional rights in the worst possible of ways . 
  hahahahaha ... hahahahahaha . 
   their elected leadership was removed by force their leadership should have organised either elections or at least a referendum . 
  not understake pro-russian decisions without consulting the population . 
  yanukovic is at fault for losing popular support and anyone who denies that is out of their mind . 
   it 's their rights that had been denied and no amount of geopolitical acknowlagment can legitimize the current ukranian government in their eyes . 
  yes but putin sending guns , heavy arms and soldier didnt help legitimise the current govt , did it ? 
  so that means turkey supports break away regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? 
  okay good to know . 
  how big is the mexico-us border ? 
  that 's 3175 km . 
  how much is it if you drive from lonon to istanbul ? 
  so you 'd have to build a fence that spans london istanbul and you 'd still have 170 km of fence . 
  how the hell can you compare the us mexico situation with the european one ? 
  open a friggin map from time to tme instead of making ignorant comments . 
  well that 's fine and dandy . 
  how about the spending on the army per country ? 
  the us spends more , percentage wise than france , germany , uk . 
  you ca n't just look at exports . 
   will have a proper military industrial complex . 
  it 's all good for patriotic ( nationalist ) reasons . 
  but when you look at the impact the mic has had on the us , i kinda dont really wish a strong industry in that sense . 
  because m\u00e9lenchon wouldnt get a massive boner seeing germany fail economically . 
  nope , i am against schengen , but not the eu . 
  that would make me maybe some odd mix of extreme left wing and euro-friendly centrism . 
   which is defeatist , imo . 
  there 's a lot of defeatism to go around , not just in the fn . 
   we may as well shut our borders and become isolationist , thats a strawman . 
  we can very well return to pre 1995 eu . 
  i hate this defeatist attitude . 
  omg there 's nothing we can do . 
  it 's all for naught . 
  schengen is not the eu . 
  we 'll just agree to disagree . 
   that is a failure of the italian , french , uk refugee policies , not shengen . 
  so when schengen goes well it 's schengen , when schengen fails , its the individual countries . 
  makes sense . 
  the reality is that now in france we have people who dont want to be here and can not leave . 
  close the borders and have immigrants make a camp at ventimiglia . 
   and that border control did n't catch him , despite the fact that he was checked . 
  there was no warrant buddy . 
  do you arrest everybody in your country ? 
   despite looking for him , showing that that system simply does n't work . 
  ** they were not looking for him ** . 
  there was no warrant . 
   sacrificing that for no gain and populits reasons is moronic . 
  borders are populist and moronic . 
  til . 
  i 'll end this convo here . 
  have a nice day . 
   otherwise , you 'll have to deal with the terrible inconvenience of patrolling a few stretches of passable land along our mountainous and mostly impenetrable shared border . 
  i 'm sure you 'll manage . 
  uhm , they 're taking the train . 
  and buses . 
  they 're not hiking up the alpes trying to get into france . 
  i shit you not . 
   if france wants to pony up the money for a few thousand more policemen yeah . 
  we should hire more policemen to guard the borders . 
  schengen is ridiculous and it 's time france went its own way . 
   being a country in deep financial and economic trouble . 
  it 's the 4th largest eu economy . 
  its the 8th largest economy world wide . 
  c'mon man , you 're not some poor ass 3rd world country . 
   we have insufficient secure processing facilities to keep everyone in , especially since these migrants do not want to stay there . 
  yup . 
  i can see them in nice arriving from italy , thanks a lot . 
   what did france do for you to be able to afford this smugness ? 
  what did italy do ? 
  you 're pointing the finger on how border countries will become refugee camps , well what 's yout proposition , mr 8th largest economy in the world ? 
   france or directly in paris are not eu - shengen related but 20th century muslim immigration to france related ?? 
  lets see . 
   http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34832512 break down * 2 stade de france kamikazes are not identitied ( their names are considered to be almohamad and al-mahmod . 
  they are not europeans and ** they went through the immigration route ** * 2 attackers ( one from a bar another from bataclan ) are unidentified . 
  we dont know shit . 
  * abaaoud , the ringleader ** and belgian ** and he got into europe by using ** the refugee route ** ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/12006892/international-manhunt-underway-after-french-police-let-paris-attacks-suspect-slip-through-their-fingers.html ) * the guy wanted by the police was born in belgium * the guns were not aquired in france * the thalys terrorist was a moroccan living in belgium  and closing wo n't solve it . 
  it cant get worse that 's for sure . 
   the eu hotpost concept is exactly that : a rebranding of the `` let 's turn border countries into giant migrant camps '' idea to make it less shameful to propose . 
  i know it 's a time honoured italian tradition to let immigrants leave your country easily , but what exactly is your plan ? 
  letting those immigrants flow freely is what is destroying schengen . 
  you need to put those immigrants in some place and process them . 
   it 's one of the eus biggest success stories , imho . 
  among it 's successes are the calais camps , because italy does n't give a flying fuck about stopping immigrants . 
  they let them in knowing full well they 'll eventually leave . 
  other success stories : the most want terrorist in europe apparently is in syria . 
  he went from paris to belgium ( and we know he crosses the border because there was a border control ) . 
  and from belgium to syria . 
  that 's one friggin success story we can congratulate ourselves . 
  perception of the eu is n't just for people at the border . 
  what perception should we have if the most wanted terrorist in europe atm went from paris , to belgium to friggin syria . 
  how ? 
  how is that possible ? 
  did he board a flight and for damascus or did he drive cross continent ? 
   if they kill schengen , eu will go with it , at least in the eyes of people .
