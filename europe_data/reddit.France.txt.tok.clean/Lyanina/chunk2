  and i was surprised she had never even * wondered * . 
  i must be super paranoid . 
  there are stis that are n't tested by blood tests though . 
   so it could still be worth it . 
  i 'll have to disagree as well too . 
  i 've lived in several departments ( bretagne , mayenne , doubs , rh\u00f4ne ) and have family in several more , but i would also say no tip is the norm . 
  i frequently tip 1 or 2 $ , but it 's not expected . 
  friends and family are sometimes surprised when i do , especially if service was just okay , not exceptional . 
  i think there 's a belief that it is n't necessary since waiters are paid ( or should be paid ) `` enough . '', 
  was n't there a study saying we are the world 's worst tippers ? 
  i do n't think it 's only because we usually leave `` only '' 2 $ , it 's that many of us do n't leave anything at all !, 
  my parents live in the czech republic . 
  it 's pretty neat , i like the excuse to travel . 
  i have a set of relatives outside europe , too . 
  eh , my friends and i certainly would . 
  i have a grandmother from vietnam . 
  the rest is ... well , french until at least my grandparents , beyond that we do n't really know . 
  no one has ever given me shit about it in france . 
  i can pass for a few different ethnicities . 
  i usually get mistaken for maghrebi or someone from one of the french overseas territories when i 'm in france , but will get brazil or venezuela as guesses when i 'm abroad . 
  in poland my family got a few stares . 
  that 's the only place i 've been where i remember it ever being an issue . 
  thanks , 
  how is that done in germany ? 
  do you get prescriptions from your doctor and then get the results in a lab ? 
  or are there centers for sti tests ? 
  when i 'm abroad it 's extremely easy for me to figure out where hiv testing is done , but for other stis it 's sometimes a bit more complex . 
  i guess if that 's your type ... 
  but there are * so many * hot athletes in the world !, 
   you have the hottest athlete ever they do ? 
  decent . 
  my family likes spices . 
  living in europe , i have n't come across a dish i could n't handle that the person i was eating with could . 
  i 'd definitely be out-spiced in other places though . 
  kids in my neighborhood have a ton . 
  hell , i 've even seen a couple on campus . 
  i do n't get it . 
  * french : * native language * english : * bilingual , learned as a child living abroad * spanish : * conversational , learned at school and university * portuguese : * hopefully fast-learning beginner , learning at university and by myself * german : * abysmal , learning at university . 
  no , but my brother was . 
  1990s , both of us . 
   well , at least first couplet and refrain thank goodness that 's the only required part to know to be french . 
  i used to know more , but ... um ... 
  yes , two actually -- german and portuguese at uni ( and portuguese with assimil as well ) . 
  so about that car ... 
  i think it 's super cute in french . 
  spanish is cuter , but english is cute . 
  sure . 
  i 'm not the poster you initially replied to , by the way . 
  i have n't written anywhere that i think americans `` deserve '' it ; i was just bringing forward an explanation . 
  apparently i accidentally deleted that comment ? 
  adding it here again for context  the thing is these are the ones i stick out . 
  when i lived in the us we had an american couple ask us if paris was `` very far '' from france . 
  those are the ones you remember . 
  no idea what you 're talking about . 
  marc is not pronounced the same way when it 's a first name ( i think ? 
  at least i would pronounce the c ) but yes manuel , i missed that , how did i forget something so similar to emmanuel . 
  female : ang\u00e9lique , m\u00e9lodie , harmonie , constance , cl\u00e9mence ( mildness ) , cl\u00e9mentine , claire , victoire , and a bunch of flowers , colors and stones : ambre , iris , capucine ( nasturtium ??? 
  male : cl\u00e9ment ( mild ) , olivier ( olivre tree ) , auguste ( noble ) ... okay it 's way harder with guys . 
  i met a soledad once , which i thought was a terribly sad name to give a kid but it does sound lovely . 
  and my spanish teacher in high school was an encarnaci\u00f3n , which ... meh . 
  yes . 
  but there 's no real culture problem since we 're both from western europe . 
  the euro cup did make for some conflict though ... 
  age of consent is 15 in france . 
  teens can do whatever they want with each other , but 18 + having sex with a 14 yo [ is actually illegal ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/atteinte_sexuelle_sur_mineur_en_droit_fran%c3%a7ais ) . 
  elections . 
  hopefully our national subreddit will be safe to return to in a couple weeks ... 
  yes , i know the disappointment is very bitter for a few of my friends and they will abstain rather than give their vote to someone they disagree with on almost everything -- but those who do end up casting their vote are much more likely to pick macron than le pen . 
  mine will go to macron simply because i hate le pen more and want her to get a thunderous defeat , and abstaining is n't going to give her that -- even though the thought of macron as my president for 5 years makes me cringe . 
  fluent english and french , conversational spanish , basic portuguese . 
  trying and failing to learn german . 
  i speak english fluently but i 'm still learning/trying to learn 3 * other * languages . 
  why bother , when i already speak english ? 
  it 's not a * need * ; i could get by just fine without it , but it is useful and nice . 
  it 's great to travel and understand what 's going on around you . 
  people always appreciate it when you can talk to them in their own language . 
  i mean , if you do n't want to travel i guess you do n't see the point . 
  but even without that , have you never heard a song in spanish ( shakira , enrique iglesias to name someone you 've certainly heard of ; the song macarena ) , or german ( rammstein ? ), 
  do you not think some literature is worth reading in its original language ? 
  do you not know anyone whose native language * is n't * english ? 
  i know people who speak each of the languages i 'm learning , and again , being able to communicate with them in their language is ( or would be ) great . 
  but i guess personally i just like the idea of learning a language . 
  nice illustration of my point :p, 
  england if we really mean * rival * , germany if we 're focusing on the * friendly * part . 
  many schools offer more language choices than spanish or german , but basically this . 
  aw come on , sure it sucked and some people 's reactions were a bit over the top but you 're being * way * too bitter and hateful . 
  vast majority of descendants of portuguese immigrants in france are pretty cool and very well integrated . 
  ^ i ^ certainly ^ did ^ feel ^ like ^ saying ^ fuckportugal ^ in ^ july ^ though, 
  i know single quotes and double quotes can be used for dialogue ( the former more often by the british ime ) , and what i said was n't a rule ( please tell me where i said `` never ever do x '' ) but as `` usually , '' as that 's what i often come across in novels . 
  most novels are not a bunch of inner dialogue . 
  i could use saramoga as an example as how the portuguese write dialogue and be way off . 
  when you have access to a computer ( so online and in novels ) , in english thoughts are usually written with single quotes or ( more often ) in italics , are n't they ? 
  in french , i 've seen italics most often to mark internal dialogue ( in books ) , or nothing at all : * mary is annoying * . 
  john walked away . 
  mary is annoying , john thought to himself . 
  if i were writing it by hand i 'd use single quotes . 
  using * guillemets * would lead to confusion , and i do n't think i 've ever seen it done . 
  you open and end a dialogue ( the conversation , not just one person 's portion of it ) with * guillemets * , and mark each change of speaker with an em dash , like this : `` hello , mary said . 
  -- hello , said john . 
  how have you been ?
