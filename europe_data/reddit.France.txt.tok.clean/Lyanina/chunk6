  i remember the rainbows across the falls ... and eating at the rainforest caf\u00e9 . 
  as for los cabos , i mostly remember drinking a lot of non-alcoholic * pina colada de fresa * . 
  pina colada is still one of my favorite cocktails , but i take it without the strawberry and with the alcohol these days . 
  oh , and whales in the wild . 
  gods , the whales were beautiful . 
  in my french * marchait * and * march\u00e9 * are basically the same too , i agree with you !, 
  eh , i doubt it , i 've never lived in the south . 
  i 've lived in the northwest and the east , my family is from a northeast-ish department and my friends are from all over the place . 
  southerners do speak weirdly though . 
  i speak pretty standard french , if there is such a thing . 
  and i do mean the english sound in `` hit , '' not a french * i * of course . 
  i guess you could ask another french person , but * \u00e9 * is * \u00e9 * and * \u00e8 * is * \u00e8 * to me . 
  * march\u00e9 * is a definite * \u00e9 * , like [ here ] ( https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/march%c3%a9#prononciation ) , where the * \u00e9 * sound in my ears is quite similar to [ this ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/hit ) . 
  maybe it 's a regional thing ( or maybe we just pronounce - ay differently xd ) , but i 've * never * heard it that way . 
  at least when i speak , * tr\u00e8s * is like * tray * but without the yy sound ( and obviously with the harder french r ) , * march\u00e9 * is like * mar * + * shit * without the t sound . 
  guess you 're not looking for a french lesson , but \u00e9 sounds more like the sound in the english word * bit * or * hit * , \u00e8 is more like * tray * or * say * but without the `` y '' sound . 
   i like it . 
  it 's a decent pilsner . 
  omg a belgian said this about kronenbourg . 
  i should screencap this . 
  i hate it with a passion . 
  i stick to german , belgian , and czech beers for the most part . 
  anyway , kronenbourg is not our best beer ... it 's just the most commercially available one ( though i guess they 're the brewery that makes grimbergen this side of the border , and i do like that one more ) . 
  i like les 3 monts better too . 
  goudale is kinda special but fun and still better than kronenbourg . 
  ninkasi makes some interesting stuff in lyon . 
  i mean , really , we have a ton of beers that are better than kro , they 're just ... harder to get a hold of , and not really worth it when it 's so easy to buy belgian beer . 
  i grew up with american lemonade ... oh , and * pink * lemonade ... xd the first time i got served lemonade in france i was * so * disappointed . 
  i have been tricked so often by this . 
  i still call sweetened and diluted lemon juice `` lemonade '' . 
  but nope , in france that 's called * citronnade * and * lemonade * is a clear , fizzy drink , that i assume is basically sparkling water with lots of sugar and some lemon . 
  * citronnade * tastes way more like actual lemon . 
  i do n't know anyone who calls 7up and sprite lemonade though . 
  ouch , too soon . 
  i 'm a student , renting a fully-equipped 150 square meter apartment in a big ( for france ) city with 4 other people for 1 500 euro per month ( including electricity , heating , water , and i guess the furniture ) . 
  it 's a pretty sweet deal imo because the apartment is fricking awesome and just next to my uni . 
  see , i love the writing style so much . 
  hugo is one of my favorite authors . 
  i 'm not daunted by length , and i love his style , so ... :( that 's sad . 
  * les mis\u00e9rables * by victor hugo is my absolute favorite book . 
  and i usually read foreign books . 
  it makes me cry so much ... and it 's beautiful . 
  when i still lived with my parents and something ( a stabbing , a shooting , anything about drugs ) came up in the national news my family would always joke : `` i bet it was in marseille . '', 
  and , uh , it often was . 
  but to be honest i clicked on this thread expecting the answer to be * saint-denis * . 
  yeah , i grew up outside of france so did n't have that problem . 
  but i wish we did n't dub everything . 
  maybe our english would be better if we did n't . 
  i prefer subtitles . 
  i was going to tell them to take corsica but we 're keeping nice . 
  yes . 
  recently in france [ l214 ] ( http://www.l214.com/ ) has been getting national coverage on the news for releasing videos taken in french slaughterhouses . 
  they are the main organization pushing for veganism ( and , as a stepping stone , more humane treatment of animals and reduction of meat and dairy consumption ) . 
  i would say we have many animal shelters , like [ spa ] ( http://la-spa.fr/refuges ) , society for the protection of animals , or [ 30 million friends ] ( http://www.30millionsdamis.fr/jagis/jadopte-un-animal/ ) . 
  i 'm not too familiar with other organizations . 
  veganism is * not * very popular in france ; our food culture is big on the meat and dairy . 
  that said , i know several vegetarians and one vegan , not including myself . 
  i think vegetarianism at least is on the rise , especially among younger people . 
  human . 
  french . 
  european . 
  lgbt . 
  dunno , maybe `` western europe '' ? 
  let 's just say `` everything else . '', 
  i have no particular attachment to any region or city , having moved around too much to develop one . 
  what ? 
  this is a thing ? 
  are you afraid of anything in particular ? 
  solo travel is a thing for many people , and the cities you intend to visit are very frequented by tourists . 
  there should n't be anything to worry about if your itinerary is mapped out and you know how to get from a to b. 
  ( i guess you need to start thinking about that ! ), 
  i think you 'll enjoy the trip a * lot * , especially if you 've never been abroad before !, 
  the only risk would be feeling lonely and getting bored . 
  personally i * love * visiting places alone , but if 15 days without real company sounds rough to you , look up meetups and couchsurfing meetups in your area , and go to tourist-frequented bars where you 'll find other travellers . 
  i excelled in the junior high/high school system and chose the right section and all , but i would n't say i was `` satisfied '' with it . 
  i think it 's too rigid and does not allow for enough versatility . 
  splitting the `` general '' high school classes into three sections literary , scientific , and economic sucks . 
  it 's asking 15 or 16-year-olds to categorize themselves , instead of , say , taking a math class * and * a literature one , or studying electricity and math but not biology . 
  i do n't think the american system is the solution , but i do n't think ours is ideal , either . 
  i do n't believe it allows to bring out the full potential of its students , and i think it asks for a choice ( that you ca n't easily go back on ) too soon . 
  not to mention the whole `` a * s * can do anything a * l * can , but not the other way around '' thing that was repeated to me throughout my high school years . 
  so if you realize too late that the career you 've just discovered you would like to pursue pretty much requires a bac s , well , sucks for you , mate . 
  wait , the french do this too . 
  ... gee , now i feel bad for belgians . 
  i do n't eat animals . 
  i guess i once killed a fish . 
  used to eat pretty much everything * except * most fish , ironically enough . 
  yes . 
  we also guillotine those who spell `` guillotine '' wrong . 
  personally it was the french boxing that scarred me . 
  xd though i ca n't imagine i 'd have fared any better playing rugby ... oh god . 
  are you telling me you never had football at school ? 
  * lucky . 
  * but yes , this essentially . 
  judo is very popular . 
  i love belgian chocolate way too much . 
  andorra , maybe ? 
  just because i never think about them so i guess by default that makes them my least favorite . 
  i could make a case for the uk though ... but that would be petty . 
  to piggyback on this one because france ...
