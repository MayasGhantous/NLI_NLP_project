  but i 'll start with vienna and bratislava . 
   the first time i went to church on a sunday was there i 'm not surprised and that might be true for me as well . 
  i still joke with my family that if poland did n't manage to make me christian , nothing ever will . 
  lots of lovely places ( and churches ) to see though . 
  do you remember liking it ? 
  i was n't exactly awed by trips in middle school . 
  :p but berlin then poland , that must have been pretty cool . 
  i * loooove * staying in prague . 
  that 's all i had to contribute . 
  where in poland did you go ? 
  i went to the united states . 
  i just realized that was my first experience abroad . 
  it was pretty nice to be honest , i was a kid and the us was like this huge playground for me . 
  an internet test decided i know `` only '' two-thirds of the words of the english language and i used that to play on an extremely common stereotype/joke . 
  i do n't actually believe that i suck at english , but let 's face it , a lot of us do . 
  i refuse to believe that fn supporters * in france * speak english so well that that entire sub is in english . 
  so i still feel okay . 
  yes , please , people who vote fn , tell me who you are and tell me you love donald trump ... ... ... 
  on the basis of your results , we estimate you know 67 % of the english words . 
  you said yes to 67 % of the existing words . 
  you said yes to 0 % of the nonwords . 
  confirming that the french suck at english ? 
  oh , yes . 
  yes . 
  i 'm way too lazy though . 
  bread and chocolate we always have on hand . 
  chocolate . 
  i love chocolate . 
  other than that , good french bread . 
  or better yet , bread * with * chocolate . 
  i am so guilty of this . 
  enchanting . 
  gosh , i ca n't stand his singing ... 
  interesting that he 'd be your example !, 
  he has great songs that can stick in my head forever but i 'm not a fan of his voice . 
  for good reason !, 
   lax culture well , we get [ more holidays ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country#countries ) than americans do ... 
  honestly that probably plays a part . 
  but `` lax '' does not have the best of connotations , you know . 
  we 're not negligent or slackers ^ wedohavestereotypesaboutthespanish . 
  but work is n't our whole life , that 's for sure . 
  prague is an awesome place to visit , but if you work and live there it 's not like you 're on holiday all the time ( source : my parents live in czechia ; i 'm actually typing this from there ) . 
  they work , too . 
  and what the hell is a `` clean history '' ? 
   where people are just very civil and friendly that 's what you meant by `` lax '' ? 
  guess it 's time for me to relearn english . 
  also , americans are * very * friendly in that extroverted , in-your-face kind of way . 
  i can say that french people often seem cold because , while we may be polite , we 're not the kind to strike up a conversation with strangers and show them pictures of our kids . 
   in the whole country sorry , there are assholes everywhere . 
  also , norway is not in the eu . 
  europe ! = eu . 
  i 've found many places in europe to be warm , welcoming , and pleasant . 
  i 've lived in the us and enjoyed my time there , too . 
  i have no idea what you 're looking for . 
  i 'm terrible with music , but since french is so lovely i guess even if i mess up horribly these will do : [ le vent l'emportera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgcrvbjybe ) -- from a phonetic perspective , i really like how he smothers some vowels and brings out some nasalized endings of words . 
  [ caravane - raphael ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhjoy0osd_y ) -- i think it 's a good example because the instruments , the voice and lyrics are allowed to shine through . 
  [ de temps en temps - gr\u00e9gory lemarchal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47gcsombz1u ) -- a voice every french person will recognize [ je l'aime \u00e0 mourir - cabrel ] ( https://youtu.be/bmzvtfcu0zq ), 
  interesting question . 
  * i 'm french , that was bound to be my answer . 
  beyond that , though ... 
  i seem to recall a civics class in high school that was about * europe : identit\u00e9 et diversit\u00e9 * . 
  which is exactly what it sounds like . 
  it 's hard to say there is a common european culture , or a single european `` identity . '', 
  despite that , i 'm inclined to believe there is * something * , because i feel strongly european , not just french . 
  so what the hell makes me feel that , if european culture does n't exist ? 
  maybe it 's the fact that i feel that way that creates a sense of european culture . 
  that , and the ease of travel in europe ( even outside of schengen ) , and how common it is to come across expats from another country and their children . 
  i went to school with miguels , wosinskis , traczyks , bauers , et caetera . 
  they were french . 
  they were european . 
  of course this this is not common to all of europe , but this coupled with the fact that i 've lived in other european countries and traveled to more has instilled me with a * sense * of europe which i 'm incapable of rationally defending with actual examples of common culture and values . 
  i 'm reading these comments with interest . 
  do n't we all use the metric system at least officially ? 
  ( i mean , i thought even the uk is supposed to be trying to move towards it ... ), 
  not europe in general . 
  messenger and regular text messages seem most popular . 
  i personally also use whatsapp . 
  jesus , you ca n't just ask a french person that . 
  i 'm so torn right now . 
  i was going to answer `` no , '' good thing i checked the comments beforehand . 
  all of this is true , plus the perceived elitism of s classes versus the other ones in high school . 
  also , in middle school , the `` bilangue '' and `` europe '' sections are sometimes used the same way you described parents using greek . 
  there 's no * official * splitting by level , but both parents and schools try to get around that . 
   weird languages like german hihi . 
  from what i remember ... * lots * more driving involved in the us . 
  no , we just wish parisians were . 
  typo , private school , or business school . 
  but i had the same mental reaction . 
  i think they just wanted to reinvent wwi . 
  ( yes , i admit it , i was kind of pissed . ), 
   that the french hate everybody . 
  they do n't . 
  nah , only the british . 
  i 'm still a student , so no career to speak of . 
  no debt and i should graduate with none . 
  i 'm so very thankful for that when i look across the pond , so to speak . 
  tuition costs around 600 $ per year where i study , but my fees are waived because i 'm * boursi\u00e8re * , which is the term for student who are on government scholarship based on how much ( or how little , really ) their parents earn in a given year . 
  there are different levels : some people only get free tuition , others receive money to help support themselves during their studies . 
  another government entity also helps pay for part of your rent . 
  i do n't think i know anyone who is getting into significant debt to pay for their studies .
