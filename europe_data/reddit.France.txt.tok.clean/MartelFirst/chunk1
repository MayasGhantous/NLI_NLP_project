in france we have `` le petit journal '' which i guess can be said is kind of in the daily show format , as in it 's humorously commenting actual news or social subjects . 
  i 'm sure now that there are other shows taken straight from the daily show style , but i have n't watched tv in years . 
  but otherwise we 've had fake comedy news like [ les guignols de l'info ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/les_guignols_de_l%27info ) ( puppet news ) for decades now , and [ groland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groland ) in a more burlesque style . 
  just throwing this out there : i 'd like to take this opportunity to mention `` planet of the apes '' by pierre boulle as a french book to read . 
  short , page-turner , classic , modern , easy to get a hold of in any language , and relevant considering the movie is about to come out !, 
  french guy talking here . 
  i fucking love blind guardian . 
  i used to play warhammer or dungeons and dragons with geeky friends when i was younger , and we 'd always put in some good old blind guardian on . 
  good memories . 
  edit : i got ta say though , [ curse of feanor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfaskjn4yke ) is definitely my favorite song of theirs . 
  * all hope is gone but i swear revenge !, 
  [ ... ] after all i 'm still aliiiiiiive !, 
  i always thought that the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia was one of the reasons stalinism fell from favor among the far left in western europe , along with the release of `` the gulag archipelago '' in the early 70s . 
  not sure i 'd want a president chosen solely because they 're minorities ... 
  lingerie , haute couture , fashion , beautiful buildings and monuments , great museums , bakeries , and of course , rude people . 
  paris . 
  there 's no way he 'd be reelected . 
  if he tried he 'd be humiliated even more , whereas here at least he appears to be taking the high ground by stepping down in favour of a better candidate . 
  also , seeing how everything he does receives criticism , he even gets booed on the bastille day parade , and you can see it makes him uncomfortable , i do n't even think he 'd want to be president for 5 more years . 
  the bretons and normans fight over whose culture/history or whatever is responsible for the [ mont saint michel ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/mont_st_michel_3,_brittany,_france_-_july_2011.jpg ) . 
  as it stands , the mont saint michel is in the current administrative division of normandy , but it 's practically right at the border between brittany and normandy . 
  bretons argue that its construction and whatnot is a result of their culture , whereas the normans are glad that the mont-saint-michel is in its rightful place in their turf . 
  it is a debate which has torn the country for decades :(, 
  exactly what i thought . 
  plus the guy keeps repeating `` you should n't have gotten the euro '' , all the while clearly demonstrating and admitting his total ignorance of the most basic irish issues . 
  yet he has the arrogance to state his uninformed opinion ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  france gets the most shit from individual people all the time . 
  in most surveys here france is inexplicably among the `` most hated '' countries . 
  i think it 's mainly due to british and us cultural influence being so strong , that you export your francophobia and bad jokes pretty well . 
  you better not even trianon , or we 'll kick your austerlitz !, 
  are their chances so low ? 
  i thought they could obtain a majority without the intimidation being * that * blatantly obvious . 
  especially considering chances are pro-ukrainians would boycott the referendum anyway . 
  it 's like pro-russians get a thrill showing the world how authoritarian they are . 
  and is n't the region not inhabited by a majority of finns/karelians anymore ? 
  i 'm not sure , but i thought i read that with the soviet deportations , colonizations , russifications and whatnot , the region pretty much ca n't be considered finnish in identity anymore , so if it were returned to finland that would be quite a big problem , demographically . 
  stop being so paranoid , or clinging on to its old empire 's `` client states '' and whatnot . 
  stop being stuck in a cold war mindset . 
  accept that the cold war was lost , and seek a friendly relationship with both the eu and the us , who i sincerely believe would welcome it with open arms . 
  no one 's going to attack russia . 
  you do n't need buffer states . 
  if russia were n't so aggressive there would n't be a weapons escalation in eastern europe , and russia would be perfectly safe . 
  by all means , it can protect its economic interests and special relationships with neighbors , but i feel this could be best done if russia tries to be liked by its neighbors , rather than feared . 
  fear just drives its neighbors closer to the eu and nato , and then russia complains . 
  if it opened itself to a friendlier relationship , it could be a special partner of the eu , and would profit economically . 
  we 'd buy its gas and resources without thinking twice about it , we 'd send more students there to learn russian , and we 'd include it more openly in international affairs ... 
  some people say that in order for russia to survive considering its size and regional diversity it needs a dictatorship-like rule . 
  i do n't think that 's necessarily the case . 
  sure , there may be more separatism under a moderate democracy , but democracies have managed to deal with that sort of thing , like canada with quebec , or even like france with a fairly strong presidential republic whose identity is based around a republic one and indivisible . 
  russia is a federation of autonomous republics , and this could be accepted as a good deal by the regions . 
  now sure , places like chechnya may be more of a violent problem , and russia would get international condemnation for trying to quell separatism , but it would still be better for its image than bullying everyone and appearing to be an unflinching quasi-dictatorship . 
  defending its internationally recognized borders and sovereignty is , ultimately , according to international law , justifiable . 
  so it would n't necessarily explode if it were less aggressive internationally . 
  pretty neutral , though the eu is n't covered a lot . 
  mostly just hear about the eu during eu parliament elections , and if there 's a really special circumstance . 
  yeah , i see what you 're saying . 
  the tipping culture is just awkward here . 
  we do n't really know what to do so we leave some change as a gesture . 
  but it 's true that i work in a hotel in paris , and i do feel almost insulted when i get tipped . 
  so maybe i should reconsider tipping in restaurants too :p, 
  * pinches poland 's cheek *, 
  my life long experience in france always included tipping , but tipping not more than some left over cent coins . 
  i 'd never tip more than a euro , but i 've always left something as a gesture regardless of the quality of the service . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  she almost looks scared . 
  the moment when the old guy comes in the frame and starts dancing reminded me of [ the dueling banjos scene ] ( http://youtu.be/mpl0q2osrwq?t=3m25s ) in `` deliverance '' , where some random old hillbilly dude starts dancing . 
  anyway thanks . 
  i love irish music . 
  those are absolutely ludicrous ideas your friends have . 
  asians are much better off than other minorities in most of the western world when it comes to discrimination . 
  one thing 's for sure though , it 's certainly not a thing to call asians `` ugly '' . 
  otherwise , of all things asians are stereotyped as hard working and intelligent , which could be advantageous to find a job , especially for companies which need to fill in their diversity quotas . 
  asians are trusted to be more law abiding and less likely to be violent or criminals than other minorities . 
  they 're probably viewed less likely to be criminals than whites even . 
  the only `` bad '' stereotypes i can think of for asians in france , is that they 're perceived as sticking with eachother , keeping to themselves , not integrating much in society ( which i believe for the asian community as a whole is mostly true ) . 
  this does n't result in scorn or hatred against asians , but rather in them being simply ignored by society . 
  people may be intimidated to approach you in a friendly manner , because they assume that you 're not interested in people who are n't your kind . 
  also , if you interact with people you may find that they 're ignorant of asian cultures , they may say stupid things , they may consider that all asians are basically the same , or confuse cultural aspects of other asian countries to yours , but overall they do n't mean any harm . 
  asians are just somewhat rare amongst non-asians so people are ignorant about them . 
  a few years ago , the chinese community in paris has protested in the streets to complain about rising physical assaults and robbery against them . 
  to be honest and without wanting to sound racist , they 're mostly assaulted by arab hoodlums ( according to the chinese themselves ) . 
  but this is a special case , since many in the asian community are illegal immigrants and thus do n't dare go to the police , which makes them easy targets for criminals . 
  i do n't think it 's a rampant problem though , and if you 're just some asian with a normal status , there 's no reason for you to be assaulted more than anyone else . 
  asian tourists are said to be robbed more as well by hoodlums because the stereotype is that they carry a lot of cash or expensive camera equipment on them , and that they 're more naive . 
  i do n't know about changing names . 
  i know french people can change names , but they have to pay a significant amount of money to legally do so , for the trouble . 
  and there 's no need for plastic surgery or trying to make yourself look less asian . 
  you 'll still look non-white , and i 'd argue being asian in a western country is the next best thing . 
  yeah , i knew you were american , and for that matter , i thought that post was a pertinent one to have . 
  could also be that we had a few threads like that recently for other countries/nationalities ( [ ireland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kl4ei/what_is_your_opinion_of_ireland/ ) , [ russia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kla4u/what_do_you_like_about_russiarussians/ ) , [ bulgaria ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2knryw/what_do_you_like_about_bulgaria/ ) ... etc ) , and that overall it 's a pretty self centered subject ( `` tell me what you like about me !, 
  lol , i had no idea . 
  so the two most prominent asian people in french politics ( asians are very rare in french politics for some reason ) , are adopted . 
  maybe that 's why they 're into politics as asians are stereotypically quite discreet . 
  for the scots too yeah , but i do n't know if the welsh and cornish are famous enough to the french people for them to include them in all this . 
  it just seems everyone loves the folklore surrounding the celts . 
  in france for example , everyone likes brittany . 
  it 's like a big fad . 
  i 'm more into arkona myself . 
  the french have no reason to dislike the irish , and with the current celtomania , i 'd wager most people like the irish for that alone .
