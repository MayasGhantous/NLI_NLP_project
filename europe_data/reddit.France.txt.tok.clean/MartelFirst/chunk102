  dual citizen and bilingual since infancy , and i ca n't think of anything more annoying and incomprehensible than the overuse of `` like '' . 
  very touching and well done . 
  also , he should try to not say `` like '' in every sentence . 
  whenever i see american chicks in the paris metro , not only can i hear them from the other side of the wagon , but they use `` like '' so much that it 's ridiculous and annoying . 
  `` it 's like , i was with amber the other day , and like , we went to this , like , typical french caf\u00e9 , and like honestly the food was n't that good . 
  it 's like we were expecting like a good french restaurant , but like the portions were like so tiny '' . 
  you have three black guys in parliament ? 
  that 's like half of poland 's black population !, 
  what a successful community !, 
  i wonder also if this technology could be used eventually against the sea level rising . 
  would have to surround the continent with those , 
  huh , that 's actually a pretty good idea , it 's like a dam for sea tides . 
  and if they look like they do in those reconstruction pictures , they look actually quite nice . 
  my french uncle ( father 's side ) was a pilot during the blitz and got shot down and died . 
  my american grandfather ( mother 's side ) was a medical officer in the philippines and pacific theater . 
  his wife , my grandmother , was a nurse there too and that 's how they met . 
  true , but iraq was so unprepared that iraqi government soldiers just ran away at the mere sight of isis combatants , and it 's ultimately pretty much accepted that the early people eventually involved in isis were waiting for the us to leave to get a chance to start their thing . 
  now i 'm not actually trying to spit on the us out of some stupid anti-americanism . 
  they were right in afghanistan . 
  they were wrong in iraq , and have left it a total mess . 
  the blame goes to the islamists , for being islamists , but it 's also fair to say the us royally fucked up . 
  and considering they gave france and germany a tremendous amount of shit for not supporting their invasion of iraq , justified with lies , it 's hard to not look back and say `` we told you so '' . 
  well they 're still in afghanistan , and there was no * need * in iraq in the first place . 
  isis took over a good portion of iraq as soon as the us left , so thanks for that . 
  ^ we ^ told ^ them ^ so, 
  i know i should understand their ignorance considering they 're north american and are thus quite far removed from these things , but i ca n't stop just hoping these videos just chose to display the most ignorant answers . 
  asian guy was the least ignorant about it , which is a surprise . 
  my oh my , are you guys obsessed with us  jk, 
  in paris , a rather big , famous square is called `` place d'italie '' , because it used to be the departure point from paris to go to italy . 
  there are also the luxembourg gardens . 
  do n't know why they 're called that . 
  there 's a metro station called argentine , but i do n't know why . 
  we also have a metro station called stalingrad for obvious reasons . 
  naturally , there are other stations or streets named after towns and cities where battles were fought , like austerlitz , bir hakeim , or named after foreign people like george v , roosevelt . . 
  well that was anticlimactic . 
  well that 's most definitely the number 1 main point i 've heard , and it would n't be so much of a problem unless you agree with the negative point number 4 in op 's link . 
  that 's a pretty good and objective summation of the main points . 
  they come in all colors , but to be honest , they 're overwhelmingly maghrebi and black . 
  it is quite something though , that many of these racaille groups are n't divided by race . 
  there are however instances of racism between blacks and arabs here and there . 
  there 's still plenty of wide open spaces . 
  now when it comes to flat land suitable to build a city , we might need to kick a few farmers out though . 
  a good monetary compensation should do . 
  `` racaille '' ( which means `` rascal '' ) , or `` caillera '' which is the [ verlan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verlan ) form . 
  or otherwise called `` wesh '' ( which is like `` yup '' , as in a stupid way of saying `` yes '' , as they typically say it that way to sound cool - though saying `` wesh '' can be used by them as an equivalent of the english greeting `` oi '' ) . 
  [ example ] ( http://a136.idata.over-blog.com/3/39/92/02/racaille-raciste.jpg ) [ example 2 ] ( http://www.islam-et-verite.com/medias/images/islamo-racailles.jpg ), 
  most countries have a lower gdp per capita than norway * yes that 's true . 
  i just found it humorous that this swedish add boasts about this , when it 's just the big mac index indicating how richer norwegians are . 
  but i get it . 
  sweden surely benefits from norwegians crossing the border and purchasing things cheaper in sweden . 
  `` welcome to sweden !, 
  look !, 
  we 're poorer than you are ! '', 
  maybe they 'll get 21 points this time . 
  that subreddit will have a field day . 
  `` the nato '' , `` the ukraine '' . 
  geeze , you really like articles do n't ya ? 
  uh , that 's napoleon iii , not the `` napoleonic wars '' . 
  and we crossed the world to invade another country without fear of retaliation . 
  means we were stronger . 
  like the us and vietnam . 
  yeah , i intended to mention this in the end of my comment , but i forgot to do so . 
  if marine le pen looses that trial , she 'll get sympathy votes . 
  it 's a win-win for her . 
  many , if not most people * will * consider her a victim of political correctness gone wild . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure we can all agree the napoleonic wars were certainly the most embarrassing time in our history !, 
  sure , we 'd be happy to just [ unify catalonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/map_administrative_divisions_of_the_first_french_empire_1812-en.svg/2052px-map_administrative_divisions_of_the_first_french_empire_1812-en.svg.png ) under the same flag . 
  yeah but at worst , all i can imagine is , if it gets bad , spain sends the army or police to restore some government order , catalonians would complain loudly , and no other country would intervene , because i ca n't imagine a situation in a western country getting as bad as say , the ukraine crisis . 
  then , from there , i guess i do n't know . 
  things would calm down at best . 
  get bloody for catalonians at worst . 
  just to be clear though , i 'm agreeing with you on that non sequitur argument . 
  so , was that first paragraph sarcastic ? 
  sorry , we never know with internet comments . 
  cause they can . 
  just saying for those who might not know . 
  nah , we here in france have been taking spaniards since the late 1800s . 
  even our prime minister , manuel valls , is some catalan immigrant . 
  okay , guys . 
  we still like you . 
  you can come once you realized you fucked up :p < 3, 
  it 's just like when vercingetorix fought julius caesar !, 
  hey guys , calm down , she 's not going to jail . 
  at worst she 'll be fined . 
  and that 's bad enough . 
  in france , in the mid 90s , after the 80s/90s skinhead movement boomed and was making headlines back in the day , and the front national was starting to get some decent numbers in elections , politicians in france were starting to worry . 
  and thus they decided to do the stupidest shit one can do while simultaneously thinking they 're doing the right thing : limit free speech to make it illegal to say things they do n't agree with . 
  in this case , it was racist speech . 
  racist speech became illegal . 
  this is fucking idiotic for one basic reason . 
  it * is * completely subjective . 
  what 's racist or not ? 
  i may say i 'm not attracted to asians ( that 's not true , just an example ) . 
  is that racist ? 
  maybe most of us here will agree it 's not racist . 
  how about if i say i 'm against interracial mixing ? 
  ( again , not true ... just example ... ) is that racist ? 
  perhaps it is . 
  but should i be punished for saying that ? 
  for now i do n't think i would be punished , but who knows how this law can be interpreted .
