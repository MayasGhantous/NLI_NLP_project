  it 's real in france too . 
  i 'm not coming at you in any way . 
  just giving a longer , perhaps more brutal opinion . 
  i mean you started your comment with this :  what they need are jobs , middle class jobs yeah sure . 
  some do get middle class jobs . 
  you know who else would like a middle class job ? 
  not everybody can get one . 
  i have a university degree , am perfectly bilingual , white , blond , and i have a minimum wage job . 
  i 'm not saying racism and discrimination does n't exist . 
  it surely does . 
  but the job market is hard for most . 
  i suck it up and hope i can gather experiences and eventually rise up . 
  i do n't burn cars and break stuff though . 
  kids in the country , who are poorer than they are , do n't break stuff either . 
  where 's our news article ? 
  i do n't want to be a complete dick , but your painfully naive comment needs something to oppose it . 
  have you ever experienced recruitment with some people from these neighborhoods ? 
  i 've seen some job `` candidates '' . 
  some of them are * not * recruitable , you would n't want them near you , and it 's not because of their skin colour or whatnot . 
  they 're not recruitable not because of lack of education ; they went to the same obligatory public schools as those who managed , those who know how to respect others , but because of their own completely toxic attitude . 
  though i have personal examples , the best example i have comes from my brother . 
  he went for a few days in recruitment for the french military . 
  you 'd think that to become a soldier , all the candidates would understand that they need to be in their best behaviour . 
  it 's the military for fuck 's sake . 
  but fuck no . 
  they were around 30 candidates , about 20 of them were basically these hoodlums . 
  they 'd answer back to the officers , would drag their fucking feet like they were in kindergarten . . etc. . needless to say , they were progressively all kicked out until of the 30 initial recruits , there were only 5 left at the end . 
  decent people , from diverse backgrounds , be they upper class , to farmer kids , to people from overseas territories . 
  but people who gave a shit . 
  people with the basic social skills to understand where they were and how to act accordingly . 
  now certainly , `` society '' must have created a mentality where a bunch of these kids are not recruitable , and they will never be functioning members of society . 
  however , i do believe they 'll never be functioning members of society until they themselves decide to change their attitude . 
  i do think much of their attitude is deliberate . 
  it 's a shit attitude . 
  and thankfully , many grow out of it , a little too late to become `` middle class '' , but at some point they do grow the fuck up . 
  yeah , it 's not like we spend millions on these suburbs already . . oh wait . 
  well actually , my grandmother * was * walloon , so yeah kind of . 
  in france we have a few public tv channels owned by `` france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions '' ( france 2 , france 3 , france 4 , france 5 , france \u00d4 , arte ... ) , which i would say lean slightly to the left , or would be center-left perhaps . 
  especially the channels which delve in more political/social subjects ( france 2 , arte ) are rather left leaning . 
  the private channels ( tf1 , m6 , direct 8 ) can be rather right-leaning , though some ( canal + ) are left-leaning . 
  i do n't know much about radio , but i 'd say it 's pretty much similar . 
  public radios may be rather left-leaning whereas private radios owned by large private media corporations may be rather right-leaning . 
  newspapers , however , are quite clearly defined on the political spectrum , and people here buy their newspapers according to their political views . 
  even a big well known newspaper like le monde , to maintain its reputation as a prestigious news source would rather present itself as neutral , is pretty much known to be leaning to the mainstream left . 
  i 've been to spain many times during my teen years . 
  stayed about a month in each ( summer `` linguistic trip '' as we call them ) . 
  loved them , had a great time ( malaga is hot as fuck though , i 'd take siestas myself ! ) . 
  another time i was in the french pyrenees , and with my family we hiked over a mountain to the spanish side , no biggy . 
  and like a mirage , we encountered a sort of chalet , which was a spanish restaurant just alone there in the middle of nowhere , on the mountain , held by a family . 
  the little girl had the deepest blue eyes i 've ever seen . 
  just a random memory for ya . 
   to actively pursue that kind of bloodshed beyond just controlling borders thing is that it was n't that simple , though . 
  i was talking about the 1600s , that was n't under napoleon of course , but under cardinal richelieu and louis xiv . 
  there were many dynamics which go beyond just wanting to invade other people . 
  of all things actually , france was so overpowered it could have gone on to do much more damage . 
  but it was a game of alliances and balances and diplomacy . 
  no leader actively sought to massacre other people . 
  napoleon gets an unfair rep , especially in anglo countries . 
  after the french revolution , most european countries attacked france to counter the dangerous revolutionary ideals ( which arguably were the right ideas compared to most other countries ' systems , despite the revolution having gone badly eventually ) . 
  whenever france won , the other european countries regrouped , reformed alliances and attacked again . 
  when napoleon got to power , because of the constant war by other countries and thus the need for a powerful leader , he inherited that state of affairs . 
  i wo n't say napoleon did n't himself sometimes seek conflict , but the dynamic in europe was set , that france wo n't be left alone as long as it does n't have a king on the throne . 
  so there was hardly any other way it could have gone . 
  but ultimately , what 's funny is that you 're reacting to me saying that france was strong at the time , instead of reacting to those making fun of france surrendering , despite hundreds of thousands of french dead . 
  why do n't you get all flustered about * that * ? 
  you only seem to be focused on one side of the issue . 
  well , we 're pretty well placed nowadays , so pretty far . 
  oh yeah , it 's definitely traditional of brittany ( bretagne ) . 
  you can get them elsewhere though , in breton restaurants which are popular enough , but i guess you need to know where they are . 
  it 's true that a basic take-out or caf\u00e9 in the rest of france , will rather serve white-flour cr\u00eapes , usually for a [ sugary desert ] ( http://www.fresh-kreps.com/wp-content/uploads/photokreps/crepes1.jpg ) ( but sometimes as [ a salt main course ] ( http://p6.storage.canalblog.com/67/22/1016167/77785784_o.jpg ) ) . 
  i wish it were true :p i 've heard it already , but i remember researching it and not finding anything serious in that regard , so i 'm assuming it 's just a legend . 
  would be cool though . 
  5 years ago i had a manual labour job in the french countryside and we were housed in tents and had to make our own food after a hard day 's work . 
  we were mostly french , but there were a few foreigners , so as a little joke to the foreigners we decided to cook some frog legs once . 
  it was the first time most of us french people had eaten some ourselves ( including me ) . 
  that 's the first and last time i ate frog legs . 
  they were good enough . 
  they seriously taste like chicken , with the texture of fish . 
  but i 'd rather buy chicken or fish . 
  i must have eaten escargots a year ago . 
  however , i used to buy some frozen escargots much more regularly ( every other month ) , as they 'd be ready in 10 minutes if you pop them in the oven , and they 're pretty good as a snack with some fresh bread . 
  but i guess that was a `` phase '' for me . 
  i figured they were an easy/good snack to make . 
  most french people hardly ever eat escargots , perhaps just occasionally in restaurants or during specific settings ( like new years , marriages or something ) . 
  it 's really easy as fuck , to be honest . 
  i just cheat because i buy premade dough . 
  in france , in every supermarket you can buy [ these sorts of packages ] ( http://media.simplymarket.fr/photo2/3596710/364435.jpg ) with premade cr\u00eapes . 
  you just pop one on a buttered pan , [ throw in a slice of ham , sprinkle with grated cheese , and break an egg on top ] ( http://recettes.viabloga.com/images/galette_de_sarrazin_complete.jpg ) , salt , pepper , i like adding some parsley on top , then when the egg looks cooked enough some 5 minutes later [ you fold that bad boy ] ( http://www.ouest-cornouaille.com/upload/ble-noir-complete_creperie-menlanndu-xl.jpg ) with the yolk in the middle , and [ voil\u00e0 ] ( http://cdn.recettes100.fr/v/fr/4/4893ae7c73432fb03a49f77c46639b4d.jpg ) . 
  huh , i actually ate two cr\u00eapes for dinner yesterday . 
  i bought a premade dough , to be honest ( cause who has time for that ? 
  ) , and then put in some ham , grated cheese and egg . 
  i made a certain type of cr\u00eape called `` galette '' though , which is more traditional with dough made of buckwheat . 
  [ that 's ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/galette_compl%c3%a8te_in_annecy%2c_france_-_20130714.jpg ) what it looks like . 
  the way i see it is people joke around that we had a white flag as our banner and they find it ironic , but the actual irony is that we probably slapped them around at the time when we were flying the white flag . 
  which is ironic because the 1600s is a period in history when we kicked the most amount of ass for the longest time . 
  a couple marks & spencer supermarkets opened in paris in the last few years and they seem popular because the products are so adorably british and whatnot . 
  anyway , british musical bands have been popular here of course . 
  often enough , a british film will be mainstream in cinemas here . 
  as someone else said , british-style pubs exist in touristy areas . 
  tshirts with the union jack , or doc martens .
