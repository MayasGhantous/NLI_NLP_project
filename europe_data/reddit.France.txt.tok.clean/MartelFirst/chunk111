  yeah , that 's what i was referencing ^ ( other than my personal irredentist ideals :p ), 
  i prefer [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lawijgwdese ) to be honest . 
  is it always the same voice actor who does these kinds of videos ? 
  we 'll take the blame if that 's the price to pay to love cheese . 
  that 's cause you have no manners . 
  da vinci was a free man , and brought/finished the mona lisa in france , when the french king fran\u00e7ois 1 paid to support his work . 
  when da vinci died , fran\u00e7ois 1 legally bought his paintings , including the mona lisa . 
  there is literally no legal dispute about it . 
  also , everyone agrees da vinci was italian , but also that the mona lisa is the most famous painting in history not only because of its famous author , but also because of it 's history in france . 
  just saying , cause many italians often jokingly claim it back . 
  you have no claim to it . 
  :p but otherwise , if i were italian , i would claim [ carla bruni 's ass ] ( http://p6.storage.canalblog.com/62/39/119589/51141665.jpg ) . 
  be proud of dat !, 
  the only reason england beat us is because we 're humble and they are n't . 
  of all things , apart from the 2 disliked countries and the us , france seems to have a more positive view of everyone else than of itself . 
  england , however . . likes england the most , and more than anyone else ... 
  i 'm guessing the catalans , and basques and some other regionalists or separatists there make spain look self-loathing . 
  if only the castillan ( aka the spanish-spaniards ) answered , it would probably have a positive score like every other country . 
  uh , italy ? 
  seriously ? 
  i thought we were bros :( how does england like us better than you do ? 
  if north africa had european culture , it would probably not be called europe , because it 's clearly a different continent , but these north african countries may have been considered `` western '' countries , or any other term which is n't associated to geography , but rather to culture/civilization . 
  perhaps , in such a case , we would have invented a whole other word to include them . 
  perhaps a word derived from `` mediterranean '' . 
  i had a similar kind of logic . 
  i mean the question is `` what are the most positively viewed countries ? 
  '' , not `` what are your favourite countries '' . 
  so i picked the least controversial countries i could think of , basically those on the sideline . 
  though of the countries you mentioned positively , i did n't pick sweden because everyone is sick of their smug progressiveness and metrosexuality . 
  :p more seriously though . 
  i have nothing against germans , on the contrary , but i 'm always surprised at how they 're always among the most positively viewed . 
  i mean germany does n't stand for any principles on the world stage , hardly participating in anything beyond european economic issues ( at least comparatively to the size of its population/economy , it seems to have a very limited diplomatic reach ) . 
  i feel they get top billing all the time on the sole fact that they 're a successful economy , and though they 're a famous country , the average guy does n't know much about germany at all . 
  twas just one of the first results on google image . 
  [ actual best plug ] ( http://www.qiao-pu.com/upload/photo/5e1668cb34b2b329902cd71fb0d7482b.jpg ), 
  oh yeah , for sure . 
  especially considering he 's a public servant , so administration is basically his job . 
  i was just saying , i kind of see where he 's coming from . 
  i get in some trouble for things like that too . 
  it just stresses me out so i delay it . 
  i kind of have that phobia too though . 
  sometimes i do n't open my mail box for weeks . 
  i do n't know why . 
  and then it 's even worse because i know there must be tons of shit in it , which makes me delay it even more . 
   a french lecturing about the evils of nationalism ... as socialist frenchman lecturing about the evils of nationalism . 
  that 's pretty damn basic no matter where you 're from . 
  please do n't make ridiculous generalizations on nationality . 
  it 's not at all the same thing though . 
  charlie hebdo has mocked judaism plenty of times with no problems . 
  implying that jews run global finance and politics , however , is something an antiracist far-left magazine does n't condone . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  or cd ( i googled the roman numeral way , but it does n't seem right . . i do n't get it ), 
  all young , able bodied men ... running away from the civil war in their country ... giving it away to the extremists ... leaving those who fight behind ... 
  lol , i know everything there needs to know about normandy . 
  my question was rhetorical because i was answering someone who did n't know what he was saying . 
  `` french in some parts '' . 
  i did n't know the vikings had exterminated the native population !, 
  lol, 
  how did the french language and rock castle building come from norse lands ? ... 
  it 's pretty much my impression as well . 
  we can have skyscrapers , and they can be built in new cities or districts in a coherent fashion . 
  but also , i would n't be against high rise buildings inside paris . 
  i mean , there are areas which have tall ugly buildings . 
  i 'm thinking of [ the 13th district for example ] ( http://www.urbanews.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/vue-du-13%c3%a8me-arrondissement-de-paris.jpg ) . 
  it would perhaps be nicer if those ugly tall buildings were replaced by more esthetic modern ones . 
  plus there 's some near-eastern religious sect about some `` saviour '' which is starting to gain followers . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 're going to start becoming a problem at some point . 
  agreed . 
  it actually makes me rage . 
  that people ca n't get off their damn phones , even when watching something they do it through a phone . 
  also , with the amount of people filming , surely they could easily find a shit copy of the same event from one of the other hundreds of people filming and putting it online who 's never going to watch it anyway . 
  me too . 
  i have fantasized about sleeping with a qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois girl who 's also a talker , so i can hear that rustic accent as i bang her . 
  working in tourism in paris , i 've often heard qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois refer to themselves as just `` french '' though . 
  i never would have dared to call them that , out of fear of being offensive to them , but to my surprise i 've heard them do it themselves . 
  at one point for example , i did a qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois customer a favour and jokingly said `` c'est bien parce que t ` es qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois '' ( `` that 's because you 're qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois '' ) , and he confirmed but saying `` ah , parce que je suis fran\u00e7ais '' ( `` yes , because i 'm french '' ) . 
  another time , i could n't help overhearing a conversation between a qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and some american or something , and the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was referring to qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as `` the french people in canada '' . 
  i 'm guessing perhaps that what these qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois actually meant was to say `` francophones '' , or `` french-canadians '' which is less radical than calling themselves all out just `` french '' . 
  not that i mind though . 
  i like it . 
  ^ ( come back to le motherland ), 
  how is he depicted in that game ? 
  the song is great , but the lyrics are the clich\u00e9 boring type for a national anthem . 
  by that i mean , by paraphrasing/parodying `` oh beautiful motherland that gave us freedom , we fought for your glory , and can live happily under your embrace ! '', 
  * snore * . . 
  very good guess !, 
  indeed though , the first line would end with `` to fight you '' rather . 
  but when i posted this , i was wondering if people who did n't know french would still understand , considering it 's still simple phrases , and i feel that if someone knows english and perhaps some latin or another romance language , they can partially understand written french by using common etymologies . 
  for the record , sentence structure is important and is the reason i put `` but i guess '' . 
  i know full well armenia is n't arab . 
  i 'm not retarded . 
  i do n't see where in the article there 's anything implying something like that . 
  hey , perhaps some incidents are reported as hate crimes though they were n't . 
  i know i , as a white guy in the service industry , have been called racist by minorities for not abiding to their demands though i know racism was not part of my motivations . 
  simply doing my job . 
  so i 'm sure some incidents were n't hate crimes . 
  however , i would n't at all be surprised if antisemetic attacks grew in the last years , and the last decade . 
  there 's absolutely no doubt that the israeli-arab conflict is imported here and in many western countries where there 's a substantial and growing arab or muslim population , and an old jewish population . 
  * hier * yesterday, 
  my favourite verse , less well known because at the end of the song , but most badass imo :  tout est soldat pour vous combattre !,
