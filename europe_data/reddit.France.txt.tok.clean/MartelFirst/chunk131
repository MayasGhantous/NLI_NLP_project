  op was just acting like a spoiled brat imo . 
  it 's exactly because i 'm french that i say this . 
  i 'm too used to seeing polish redditors complain on and on about history that it gets extremely tiresome to see you guys continue to do this , again , and again , and again . 
  do you know what we said to the us and nato ? 
  to get their bases out of french territory . 
  meanwhile you 're begging to be saved . 
  hell , you 're not begging . 
  you 're expecting , as if anyone owes you shit . 
  can some polish people stop constantly expecting that everyone else must defend them ? 
  especially when it 's one sided ( ie , for example , now you need the us more than they need you , why should they even defend you ? 
  you 're just their sphere of influence but not that important in the grand scheme of things . 
  they owe you nothing ) . 
  it 's not like there 's any real danger for poland anyway nowadays . 
  even without a nato base , there 's no way russia will try an invasion . 
  take-out street cr\u00e8pes in paris are usually composed of a pile of liquid egg and cheese dripping from a soggy tasteless cr\u00e8pe dough . 
  i ca n't find a bad picture of one but imagine holding a soggy version [ of this ] ( http://www.difapac.fr/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/1/01crepe.jpg ) in a paper napkin and trying to eat it without making a mess . 
  you usually find them in places not held by actual french people , with a sidewalk opening to sell on the street , [ like this ] ( http://www.paris-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nicos-002.jpg ) . 
  also , if they sell `` cr\u00e8pes '' and `` paninis '' like in this pic , it 's a good indication that it 's probably tasteless . 
  the `` panini '' are also pretty much shit compared to the real thing . 
  unlike the `` cr\u00e8pes '' , they 're however very practical to eat , which is why they 're popular , but they 're [ dry as shit ] ( http://www.pateapizz.com/prodimages/panini/01.jpg ) bread with some random stuffing . 
  so if i want some cheap fast food , to be honest i 'll prefer a hamburger fast food chain than this street food . 
  but if you come to paris and france and want to taste cr\u00e8pes , avoid street vendors and get a [ real cr\u00e8pe ] ( http://le1929.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ob_216fc6_crepes1.jpg ) on a plate for desert , and a [ galette ] ( https://www.atelierdeschefs.com/media/recette-e16680-galette-jambon-oeuf-fromage.jpg ) as a meal . 
   as far as i am aware , it was only in english where it was unusual to call the czech republic by `` czechia . '', 
  no , i 'd say it 's pretty much the same in french . 
  in french , though `` tch\u00e9quie '' is sometimes used , `` r\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que '' is used 95 % of the time . 
  however , i believe `` tch\u00e9quie '' in french is still more familiar than `` czechia '' is in english . 
  if i were inclined to answer your question , the last time i smiled thinking of russia is stumbling upon a video of the red army choir singing a traditional breton song . 
  [ here 's a breton interpretation of the traditional song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezbnselblvg ) . 
  if you 're one to listen to folk metal , you may have recognized that eluveitie reused the theme for their song [ inis mona ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijklhcqw5o ) . 
  but anyway , not a week ago i stumbled upon [ this russian army choir rendition of the song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwf8wdzwaci&amp;feature=youtu.be ) , and it 's especially cute when they turn their hats to resemble that of sailors . 
  i thought it was pretty cool and i believe at least my fellow frenchmen would agree considering it 's a well known song here . 
  that french version of carbonara has been around for decades . 
  that 's what we call carbonara in france , but granted , we should call it something else :p . it just uses french ingredients with pasta ( cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche , lardons , onions ( i know onions are n't `` french '' , but they 're used a lot in french food ) . . ) . 
  i think it 's very good , but granted it 's not italian carbonara . 
  however , italians are way more touchy about this sort of stuff than the french would ever dream to be , but somehow they get away with it , and we get called snobs . 
  poland is certainly developing but unless they start making more kids i do n't see how they can become a superpower with a medium-sized population . 
  they should have called it `` land of mein '' , so the play on words goes a third level deeper . 
  seriously though , this looks good . 
  can you translate the legend ? 
   and i do n't know where you 've found your info on the `` too much adultery '' stereotype , but it 's frankly ridiculous . 
  common british news , most likely . 
  did you see me mumble ? 
  it 's simply pretty obvious stereotyping right there . 
  no reason to mumble . 
  the intention was clear as day , and the reasons obvious . 
   a surprising number of americans think nestle is american it 's especially surprising considering `` nestl\u00e9 '' contains an accent that 's not in the english language , except in loan words . 
  no one spoke of `` how important france is '' , that 's just your dumbass assumptions and francophobia creeping in . 
  you insult french people as a whole although it has nothing to do with the subject in question , and you expect me to be polite to you ? 
  when were * you * polite to begin with ? 
  stop wasting my time . 
  i do n't care about your counter strike anecdotes . 
  that 's one of the most ridiculous things i 've ever read . 
  i think germans * should * be proud . 
  i 'm rather denouncing the irony in this video . 
  but go ahead and insult the `` frenchies '' , idiot . 
  i 'm very much aware of what your saying and if i had explained my comment more it would have gone something like this : germans , and all europeans , have every right of being proud . 
  i 'm proud of being french , and european . 
  and i just say it . 
  i do n't need to make a mockery out of pride . 
  i do n't need to go around it like this video does . 
  you want to say that western civilization ( human rights , equality . . etc ) is better ? 
  than just say it . 
  however one thing germans should n't be proud of is how they encouraged the migrant crisis ( the video references that ) . 
  that was/is a debacle . 
  and other less open armed countries are n't `` bad '' because of their position either . 
  this video also poses as hard hitting when actually it 's completely pc . 
  it 's a well known fact that germans are shamed against patriotism . 
  so the position in this video is pretty basic coming from a german , or even from most western european perspectives . 
  and this video acts like that 's a good thing , and others should be more like germany in that regard . 
  my point is that it 's ironic how they shit on patriotism , while all things considered , their own video is all about how germany does things better . 
  they mockingly mention the irony , but i do n't think they 'd admit that they 're coming from a sense of superiority , perhaps rather the kind that self-righteous leftists tend to have . 
  `` we are proud of not being proud '' is exactly what i was thinking while watching this . 
  good on them to at least recognize it , because i ca n't help but sense an air of superiority in this video , as well as in the previous one , and that 's [ not too surprising ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2011/11/2011-values0010.png ) . 
  it 's like the `` murica ! '', 
  thing , which looks more like people wanting to express their nationalism/pride , but they do it sarcastically to reassure themselves and others , and to drive their message more easily . 
  cause in either case , they 're still saying they 're better than others . 
  [ back in the day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrva0yovtci ) countries could actually win by singing in their own language and with their simple musical talent and the song 's general appeal . 
  i know everyone now engaging in this is posing as sarcastic , but ultimately it just turned into a farce , and it 's not any more watchable imo . 
  those are novels rather than essays , but they treat the suject of multiculturalism in a rather unfavorable way : one of the most successful contemporary french writers , michel houellebecq , recently wrote a fictional novel set in a future where france becomes an islamic state . 
  the novel is called `` submission '' and i know it was translated to english . 
  it 's not dissimilar in theme to `` the camp of the saints '' by jean raspail , written in the 70s , which is also a novel about france being changed/destroyed by mass immigration . 
  needless to say that jean raspail is considered far right , whereas houellebecq , while not considered far-right ( he is a mainstream personality ) , has been accused of islamophobia , and actually he has openly stated his distaste for islam in particular among world religions ( he himself is an atheist ) . 
  otherwise , conservative speaker eric zemmour wrote many books/essays about france , integration and whatnot , in the last decade , but i do n't think his work was translated . 
  that 's why i could only really mention novels , which are often more easily translated than essays about french society . 
  maybe another frenchman on reddit can answer with more left-wing approaches to immigration . . etc. 
  . . and there 's ros\u00e9 , and fizzy ( champagne ) . . and that 's just naming the internationally famous varieties that france is the most known for . 
  seems like you have much to discover . 
  enjoy . 
  ok so you rather mean that `` buying french is like watching ... halloween ( the movie ) '' . 
  ie , it 's so classic it invented everything and thus seems unsurprising now , cause it set the standard . 
  but it 's still your classic . 
  ( a comparison with mcdonalds seems wrong with your own argument , considering mcdonalds is pretty much a go-to example for shit food , even amongst american fast foods , americans themselves think of mcdo as a lowest common denominator ) . 
  yeah , they go a lot in spain also ... 
  but you were talking about france ( and germany ) , so i answered about those ... my point remains that the percieved quality of life is most certainly a factor . 
  but otherwise yeah , jobs and salaries are also a factor of course , but not the only one to take into account with such a broad question . 
  the french generally would n't think that the uk would offer them a desirable lifestyle , according to their culture . 
  but many do go to the uk for job opportunities there . 
  that 's to answer your question ... 
  the british come to france en masse for their retirement . 
  `` living conditions '' is n't necessarily about jobs and stuff .
