  france reacted in a very mature fashion . 
  it easily could have taken the populist rout , surfing on the wave of international solidarity and calls for revenge . 
  but hell , of all things if there could be any criticism it 's rather that france did n't react moderately/calmly enough . 
  but i 'd wager that most turks have hittite ancestry , considering the hittites were n't exterminated , and considering how they existed so long ago . 
  it 's a simple mathematical reality that most turks certainly descend from the hittites . 
  the same way [ most western europeans descend directly from charlemagne ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/commentisfree/2015/may/24/business-genetic-ancestry-charlemagne-adam-rutherford ) , who existed long after the hittites ( so his descendants had less time to multiply than the entire hittite people ) , and he is just one person ... 
  yeah and if you search `` turkic peoples '' you 'll find a list of people who speak a turkic language . 
  that 's what defines them as a `` turkic people '' , language . 
  not a racial heritage . 
  i 'm assuming you 're confusing ethnicity ( which usually is self-defined cultural/historical identity ) with racial ( or rather genetic ) realities . 
  turkic people may have genetic proximities , but only because they 're grossly in and around the middle east , and they have the same proximities with other middle eastern people . 
  the only thing which really binds them is that they belong to the same language family , and it 's only in recent linguistic science that we found those similarities . 
  so these pan-linguistic nationalisms make me laugh a little because they 're based on recent discoveries , not on concrete historical friendships/ties . 
  yes . 
  the migrant crisis stems from people mostly fleeing isis , which managed to rise from the instability in iraq , and then in syria due to the arab spring and the assad regime 's response . 
  most migrants of the current crisis come to europe through turkey , not through libya . 
  most european countries now dealing with the migrants were against the invasion of iraq which created the instability in the first place . 
  regardless , libya is the clich\u00e9 go-to argument for anyone wanting to criticize the apparently united entity `` europe '' , as if it was just `` europe '' alone as well , and not a nato thing with other allies . 
  perhaps a way to hide the iraq fiasco with something more recent . 
  but it 's just thrown out there : `` libya !, 
  '' , without explanation . 
  as if the previous situation with dictator kadhafi blackmailing europe against migrants , or for oil , was any better . 
  no , it 's the mongols ' fault for destroying the middle east a thousand years ago . 
  they had something good going but it just got ruined bro . 
  anyway i like how you speak of europe as one country/entity . 
  i disagree . 
  i prefer the original language south park , which i find more subtle , even though i initially grew up with the french dubbed version . 
  but to each his own . 
  i will admit though that the french dub for sp is fine . 
  other good french dubs that come to mind are jim carrey 's voice actor , the dubbing for american history x and fight club were good , and homer 's voice in the simpsons ( as well as some other characters here and there - though i ca n't stand marge and lisa 's voices ) . 
  actually , french dubbing is one of the best out there . 
  it 's handled by experienced professionals and the industry is leagues ahead of much of the rest of the world . 
  though of course , compared to the original voices , there 's no comparison . 
  original is always better . 
  also , naturally , if you 're used to the original voices , you can always find examples of french dubs which are thus comparatively weird or not as effective . 
  it 's a good thing that it 's easier and easier in france to see movies in their original language ( thanks to tv options to change languages , and big cinemas in many big cities now mostly showing movies in their original language ) , but dubbing is here to stay . 
  damn irish always having their slightly different versions of popular sports , or entirely different sports as most popular sports , just to have a good excuse to never win international competitions :p, 
  a good example is `` forest '' in english being `` for\u00eat '' in french . 
  that 's why french derivatives keep the `` s '' , like `` forestier '' . 
  also in english `` beast '' , is in french `` b\u00eate '' which keeps the `` s '' in `` bestial '' . . etc. 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  that 's interesting . 
  but still , most keyboard users are n't programmers so ... :p as much as i respect the work of programmers , it seems the computer geeks created keyboards to fit their own needs rather than that of the general population . 
  it does n't bother me that much though , but it 's good to know the reason for it . 
  also , the period '' . '', 
  can only be made if you use the shift button . 
  the semi-colon '' ; '' is the default button ... that makes no sense to me . 
  we naturally use periods all the time . 
  sentence : immediate annexation . 
  no , i 'm not with them . 
  alright , well considering city limits , marseille is [ by very far ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communes_in_france_with_over_20,000_inhabitants ) the 2nd city in population . 
  however if we look at the individual wikipedia pages for each city , we indeed see the metro area population for lyon ( 2.2 million ) is indeed larger than that of marseille ( 1.8 million ) . 
  that 's surely why lyon 's economy is larger than marseille 's . 
  so i guess we can say that lyon is france 's 2nd city , if we consider the metropolitan area , which in truth would be wiser . 
  is n't marseille proper ( ie , the actual city , not the metropolitan area ) the 2nd largest in population ? 
  and lyon third in population , but 2nd in gdp ? 
  i 'm assuming you 're speaking of the metropolitan area ? 
  but obviously , this website is referring to the actual city limits . 
  granted , a city is rather defined by its metropolitan area , but the actual political limits are the website 's criteria , so they 're not wrong . 
  and it 's not impertinent on the website 's part , since they do n't seem to focus on economy , but rather on history and culture . 
  suburbs had/have influence , but they 're not a main focus ... 
  in france , i pay 30 euros a month for : * fiber internet * unlimited land line phone calls ( but who uses them now anyway ? ), 
  * a decent 4g cell phone service ( with unlimited sms of course ) * cable tv ( 100 + channels ) that 's a pretty basic service here . 
  considering minimum wage in france is something along the lines of triple romania 's , it 's more than evened out , so i 'll take what i got . 
  on new years normal people usually party at home while dodgy people will come to paris to hang out in the streets . 
  however there 's diversity everywhere , sure , but most of paris is certainly middle to upper class europeans no matter how many blacks and muslims tourists claim to see . 
  ah , makes sense . 
  well that 's an interesting fact about names in both our countries < 3, 
  in french : camille , dominique ( dominic ) , gabrielle ( gabriel ) ... 
  these names are pronounced the same whether it 's for a girl or a boy . 
  these names work for both sexes . 
  so if we only hear the name , we never know if it 's a guy or chick until we see the person . 
  that 's the only `` weird '' thing i can think of for french names . 
  otherwise , since norman/frankish/french names influenced english names today , there are few weird french names if you know english culture . 
  pre-norman english names were weird as fuck , more scandinavian sounding . 
  maybe that 's an interesting thing about french names then ? 
  their influence ? 
  otherwise there are still a few untranslated ones like fran\u00e7ois . . ( frank and francis do n't cut it ! ) . 
  also jean is an exclusively male name in french , whereas in english i feel it 's used for females ? 
  i 'm just thinking of jean grey ... :p . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eau_de_toilette https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eau_de_cologne they 're french terms which are still very much in use in english . 
  i live in paris . 
  there are very few blacks or north africans where i live ( south ) , and where i work ( center ) . 
  tourists usually come to paris from the cdg airport . 
  so they need to go through the northern suburbs to get to paris , which is the most `` african '' area in france , and then tourists often visit northern neighborhoods of paris like montmartre , which are much more multiethnic than the rest . 
  but paris , and cologne even less , is far from being a `` muslim stronghold '' . 
  that 's retarded . 
  plus lemmy a couple weeks before ( at 70 ) . 
  all these brits are falling like flies !, 
  people always mention this too ... 
  anyway , here 's '' [ the lie ] ( http://www.arretsurimages.net/media/breve/s187/id18660/original.79239.jpg ) '' . 
  a graph representing the front covers of charlie hebdo . 
  ok , perhaps i overstated its critique of judaism , but i 'd rather say that judaism is rarely a focus in news , considering the tiny relevance of this absolute minority religion . 
  judaism does n't affect society much at all , that 's why they mention it less . 
  christianity is mentioned much more . 
  about that cartoonist being fired , it was n't about `` judaism '' per se , it was a joke about how being jewish gives advantages in life . 
  i feel that goes a step further than usual , but still i think charlie hebdo was wrong to fire that cartoonist . 
  but if anyone thinks he was fired just for that , and not for long standing editorial disagreements , they 're just being na\u00efve . 
  but the point is completely off . 
  the point was that people accuse charlie hebdo of being islamophobic specifically .
