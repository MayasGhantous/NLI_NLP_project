  well sure , maybe it is , but not more anti-islam than it is anti-christian , and anti-religion in general , as any far left publication would be . 
  it 's funny how foreign medias see charlie hebdo . 
  first off , no they 're not racist . 
  they 're clearly an anti-racist , anti-fascist , left-wing satirical magazine . 
  if some foreign medias do n't get that , they 've clearly not done basic research . 
  and anti-racism in france is the same as in every other western country . 
  we 're up-to-date with what 's offensive . 
  we 're perfectly aware of every new politically correct position and taboos ... charlie hebdo have always made fun of racism by using obscene racist stereotypes . 
  they 're like a far-left version of / r/imgoingtohellforthis . that 's probably where the confusion comes from , but i guess obvious sarcasm gets lost in translation ... 
  they also spit on christianity and judaism more than they do on islam , so all those foreign medias , which claimed charlie hebdo was focusing on insulting islam ( and thus somehow deserved it ? 
  ) , are an embarrassment to journalism . 
  secondly , they 're a crass magazine . 
  like a political version of mad magazine . 
  foreigners are often shocked by this . 
  perhaps since it 's a french publication they imagine it 's `` classy '' or something , and they associate it to freedom of speech , aka a noble thing , so they imagine it 's some poignant comedy . 
  sure , sometimes it points out political and social realities in a clever way ... that 's what satirical magazines do , but they also have very crass jokes . 
  their humour relies a lot on shock value . 
  i 'm not leftist but i have to say that the misconceptions i 've heard and read from foreign medias annoy me . 
  especially when critics come from left wing foreign medias , who think they 're holier-than-thou by `` discovering '' that charlie hebdo `` is actually sooo racist ! '' . 
  charlie hebdo is probably more progressive than those `` left-wing '' american medias who criticize it . 
  but in the very least , you 're on the same side !!, 
  why are you criticizing people with the same ideas as you ? 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about !, 
  that 's even more retarded then . 
  that 's completely retarded . 
  it 's a city of millions of people . 
  the chances you 're there on the wrong day , at the wrong time , in the wrong place , and one of the victims of all the potential people in the city is minuscule . 
  as a guy working in tourism in paris , there were so many cancellations after the terrorist attacks ... 
  it 's completely stupid . 
  i remember receiving cancellations from americans and thinking to myself `` uh . . there are mass shootings every damn week in the us and you 're afraid to come to paris because it happened once in a blue moon here ? '' . 
  i feel perfectly safe . 
  and it 's a pity for scared tourists , because they would have gotten fewer lines in museums , lower prices and whatnot , if they were n't completely hysterical and afraid of `` terror '' . 
  what i 'm about to say is probably insensitive , but the next attractive european city to get hit is probably the best place to go to for tourism , within the couple weeks after a tragedy . 
  our president probably only speaks french correctly , and dables in embarrassingly bad english . 
  our prime minister however was originally spanish , and became french later , so he surely speaks spanish ( or catalan - he was born in barcelona ) fluently . 
  i think he 's ok in english . 
  i do n't understand op 's post , but with names like `` k\u00e9vin-dj\u00e9n\u00e9 '' ( the son ) , and `` dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba '' ( the mother ) , they 're probably at least partly african in origin . 
  those are n't french names , but they 're stereotypically african sounding ( plus `` k\u00e9vin '' as a name , in france , is often associated to lower education , as are most names which sound american to us , like jennifer would be the feminine equivalent . 
  you combine that typically lower education name with some `` dj\u00e9n\u00e9 '' which sounds african = it 's probably an african immigrant family ) . 
  maybe that 's why op speaks of immigrants ? 
  i 'd argue that anti-jewish attacks are probably more easy to identify , because one would usually have to specifically target a synagogue , or a jewish cemetery , or jews wearing kippas ... 
  whereas , say , an antimuslim person , might just need to walk out in the street and find arabs to attack without necessarily expressing antimuslim sentiment . 
  same for anti-white hatecrimes . . if i dare say so . 
  i mean whites * are * still an absolute majority ... 
  it may just look like some white guy only got jumped by hoodlums , when the motives , or at least the target choice , could potentially be racism . 
  also , the fact that muslims are so much more numerous than jews probably accounts for why jews are so much more often victims of hatecrimes , because chances are many hatecrimes against jews are perpetrated by the former ... if i dare say so :p . 
  ok thanks . 
  so i gather they just threw a tree on there and invented some symbolism for good measure , despite trees not being historically or culturally in french imagery . 
  we , for some reason , have a big tree on [ our euro coin ] ( http://www.yuribs.com/pics/eurocoins/fra1_1,00.png ) , but we do n't have a national tree ... btw , can anyone enlighten me for why we have a tree on our coin ? 
  it looks cool but i never heard of a tree as a symbol of france or the republic . 
  it 's just that when we see red bricks , white trash , and british police officers , we all naturally just think `` manchester '' . 
  though it seems like it goes out of its way to use curse words ( `` half-assed '' , `` dicking around '' ... ) , which strikes me as slightly bizarre . 
  like an old person trying to speak in youth slang . 
  it 's like vice wants to show how close it is to the common man , to us plebs :p . 
  oh , what a surprise . 
  leftists grossly misrepresenting `` conservatism '' through exaggerated `` satire '' is the same in the east as it is in the west . 
  and if this thread is to be believed , in the east , just like in the west , people think it 's poignant political commentary . 
  yeah , it 's a totally french custom . 
  my friends fran\u00e7ois , and jacques , and even jeanne went out and burned cars for new years . 
  people blame norwegian immigration , but that 's racist . 
  it 's totally just native french youths who burn cars on new years , and on the national holiday . 
  to show their appreciation . 
  i disagree . 
  this is a hypothetical , but imagine a belligerent country `` expanding '' , just like in a strategy video game , against weaker opponents , and being completely unopposed by the stronger nations which * could * stop it . 
  so the belligerent country is given a free pass to expand ... until it 's powerful enough the beat the stronger nations , thus no one can oppose it anymore . 
  that 's somewhat of an extreme scenario , but it 's not unheard of in history . 
  strong nations have stepped in to put in check belligerent nations , to balance things out . 
  one can think of napoleonic france , or nazi germany as obvious examples . 
  but overall , throughout history , whenever an `` overpowered '' nation started invading its neighbors and being belligerent , others did eventually step in to stop it before it was too late . 
  wait , what ? 
  what makes you think you 're the center of attention ? 
  that 's completely laughable ... 
  i do n't even know how to react to that comment of yours . 
  what ? 
  well , the other idiotic extreme is `` hurr durr let 's not get involved in anything and things will sort themselves out and we wo n't be affected '', 
  well i mean , disney made `` beauty and the beast '' , `` sleeping beauty '' and other fairy tales which are french ( shared with other european countries which had variants of the same tale ) , and since these cartoons were very successful in france , then yeah , their aesthetic probably influenced how these fairy tales are imagined , especially by children ( i mean , children wo n't watch the beautiful 1940s jean cocteau `` beauty and the beast '' movie ... they 'll watch the disney cartoon ) . 
  gustave dor\u00e9 was a pretty influential artist in france ( and europe i imagine ) , and illustrated perrault 's fairy tales , thus i 'd say we kind of imagine old timey fairy tales with this kind of art . 
  [ little red riding hood ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/loup1.jpg ) , [ blue beard ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/barbebleue.jpg ) , [ puss in boots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/lechatbotte1.jpg ) ... 
  but otherwise , i 'll have to mention the obvious , sad or not , that disney 's aesthetic is probably what children imagine now for places `` once upon a time '' . 
   and source on america starting the war ? 
  uh , it 's pretty commonly accepted that the us invaded iraq although the un did n't approve of it , and many european countries disapproved , and were `` sanctioned '' and humiliated and insulted by america for it . 
  still waiting for that apology though . 
  it 's also pretty well accepted that the current destabilization of iraq , and of the middle east , is largely due to the mishandling of the us invasion of iraq , that everyone warned the us against . 
  that 's not saying the us is responsible for every conflict and blabla . 
  we can go back in time and consider french and british colonial management is responsible . 
  or go back to the ottomans , the mongols , the byzantines , the romans . . 
  but currently , yes , the us is largely responsible for the destabilization in the levant area . 
  but ultimately , it * is * only isis ' fault for its own existence , so i 'd rather blame them instead of unwilling facilitators . 
  his french side was part jewish , and his hungarian side was catholic , if i remember correctly . 
  but yeah , apparently , when it comes to his personal beliefs , he was at least brought up catholic , despite having some jewish ancestry . 
  i 'm just wondering if public school teachers in the us are allowed to wear kkk outfits . 
  heh , yeah , anyway same here . 
  a religious marriage is `` invalid '' as far as the state is concerned . 
  would-be grooms and brides have to go sign papers at the town hall , with witnesses , and they have to indulge in a sort of republican ceremony , if they want their marriage to be legally recognized by the state . 
  religious people thus do the religious ceremony in addition to the `` republican '' one . 
  also , it 's funny because your username resembles the date `` 1905 '' which is a very well known year in france as the `` law of 1905 '' which established the separation of church and state , aka , french secularism . 
  but critics who think we only `` target '' muslims have no idea . 
  i remember when sarkozy did the cross hand gesture when he entered ... the vatican ... and it became a heavily debated scandal here . 
  otherwise most of the time politicians do not talk about their faith . 
  much of the time we do n't even know if they 're religious or not .
