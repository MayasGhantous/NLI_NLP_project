  no , but it recognizes hatespeech directed towards an identified group . 
  but the court 's statement :  `` the `` fran\u00e7ais de souche '' is not representing any real group of people . '', 
  is completely wrong in itself . 
  the court is expressing its wish , opinion , and political bias . 
  it 's commonplace for liberals to say that `` fran\u00e7ais de souche '' do n't exist . 
  meanwhile , many people identify as such ... who are they to tell those who identify as `` fran\u00e7ais de souche '' that they do n't exist ? 
  and it 's a very well known expression , which in itself indicates that it does have sociological basis despite what the court `` judged '' . 
  that the court does n't believe in races does n't mean racism does n't exist . 
  that the court does n't believe in `` fran\u00e7ais de souche '' does n't mean that anti-french sentiment is n't hatemongering . 
  i am french , not even 100 % , but i 'm insulted . 
  fuck these pc lawmakers and judges , and their self-hatred . 
  everyone seems to have the right to be native except the french ( or western europeans in general ) . 
  i only expressed why some basques may vote fn . 
  i think you 're attributing to me things i did n't say . 
  all the towns/subdivisions in [ this south-western d\u00e9partement map ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/resultats/pyrenees-atlantiques/ ) which are purple had the fn in first position ... 
  the southernmost and largest , which is in the basque country , is a town called mendive . 
  you can click on it on the map and you 'll get to [ this page ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/resultats/pyrenees-atlantiques/mendive-64379/ ) . 
  the fn got some 28 % there . 
  but it 's a town of [ 193 people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mendive ) ... 
  in neighboring towns in the basque country , the fn usually gets over 10 % nonetheless . 
  i 'm assuming you 're a basque from spain and you 're wondering why a french nationalist party would have gains in the heart of the basque country . 
  well , truth is , regionalism is n't that strong in france , but even in regions where regionalist parties have a say , a significant portion of the population may still either be french nationalists , or they may be `` right-wing regionalists '' and thus they could consider that the national anti-immigration party is a good choice , rather than the basque regionalist parties which are usually left wing and progressive for some reason . 
  i just know that in corsica , where regionalism is more right wing and xenophobic , some regionalists who even want independence will nonetheless vote front national in the national elections because at least the fn wants to limit immigration . 
   people would have to learn what seven new real notes look like yeah , i 'll be super confused when all my 500 euro bills will change :p, 
  or decent food . 
  i 'm confused because i thought the new notes felt stronger/thicker than the old ones ... 
  for what it 's worth , i also do n't think it 's at all relevant . 
  most countries , especially in europe and in the west in general , were very different in their domestic and foreign policies 30 years ago . 
  the geopolitical context was very different . 
  there was something called the cold war for example . 
  the eu was n't in place either . 
  current leaders are from a totally different generation as those 30 years ago . 
  the 1968 generation . 
  you know , stuff like that ... 
  i 'd rather a society where nudity is n't frowned upon , than a society where women are pushed to cover themselves by jealous and puritanical men . 
  the first embraces our nature , the latter is some relic from backwards customs . 
  but regardless , you 're completely off topic . 
  in france it 's a ban on veils and other religious symbols specifically on public servants when they are at their job ... 
  in the streets and whatnot , anyone can cover their hair if they want ... another ban that exists is that of full veils which cover faces , which in essence is n't necessarily associated to religion ( though the ban was motivated by burqas . . ) , but regardless it 's a good ban because it does ban those barbaric burqas . 
  i want my freedom to be away from religion . 
  i got my libert\u00e9 here then ... 
  when poles incessantly say this , i believe they 're mostly refering to the phoney war , when we did n't invade nazi germany ( but still declared war ... ) . 
  that 's despite the fact that when nazi germany annexed the czechs , poland took advantage and annexed a little chunk of czech land themselves ... 
  but yeah , us western europeans were such meanies that one time , and thus in every discussion about contemporary eastern european problems you 'll be sure to get the opinion of a pole on how unreliable we perpetually are , regardless of the changing times and governments , unlike americans . 
   without any legitimate casus belli you mean , other than bringing civilization to the non-french ? 
  more seriously , i 'd add the use of poison gas and whatnot during wwi , and the pretty much random execution of our own soldiers to set examples . 
  i 'm really not trying to sound like an ass here . 
  i appreciate the gliwice tower as its own thing . 
  but i find it looks nothing like the eiffel tower . 
  of all things , it 's more reminiscent of [ electric poles ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/tension-poteau-%c3%a9lectrique-2736595.jpg ) . 
  the eiffel tower has a very different [ look ] ( http://www.magix.info/mcpool01/10/9f/1c/46/40/94/5b/11/e0/88/3c/bc/44/58/a7/6e/df/9f2064f0945b11e09081fce558a76edf.jpg ) , in design , aesthetics , thickness and whatnot . 
   very similar to eiffel tower bitch please . 
  ai n't nothin ' like our beautiful tower :p just joking . 
  thanks for your support . 
  after the charlie hebdo attacks , hollande 's popularity went up . 
  i 'm guessing that if he handles this new situation `` with dignity '' or whatever , many french people might rally around their current government again . 
  so chances are this `` benefits '' to both hollande 's party and the front national . 
  i 've heard the same from a russian girl in france . 
  apparently in france we touch eachother too much . 
  even in the dating experience , some `` cold '' foreigners feel they 're being touched too much , even when they like the guy/gal who 's touching them ... ( and by touching i mean a hand on the shoulder , or at worst taking their hand ... nothing that invasive ) . 
  so my question is , if they do n't want to be remotely touched even by their crushes , how am i supposed to get clues on whether or not i stand a chance ? 
  coal is only useful if you invent machines which need some . . and that 's exactly what we did :p, 
  we had to get these colonies first . 
  we were n't just born on rich ground like saudis . 
  europe has comparatively little natural resources . 
  we 've dominated and survived on brains alone . 
  yeah . 
  we call them belgians . 
  i meant the world of the french language may be vast enough for your random frenchman to consider that he does n't need to learn another language . 
  whereas for german , you 're pretty much stuck in central europe . 
  germany and german is less present around the world beyond europe . 
  there 's no rooted attitude ... old people did n't need to learn english because france is large enough for them without it . 
  young working class people do n't need to learn english because france is large enough without it . 
  only young educated people learn english , and they 're ok at it . 
  jesus fucking christ , you actually took this seriously ? ... 
  we do n't see ourselves as superior ... our english classes just suck ... 
  wait , what ? 
  le marais , a gay + jewish neighborhood in central paris with superb `` h\u00f4tels particuliers '' that date back from the 17th century , has been pretty high end for quite some time and with reason . 
  that it 's getting even more expensive than it 's already been for the last decades is something else , and a general trend for paris anyway . 
  but then again , perhaps you 're looking back 50 years . 
  when it comes to current gentrification , there are other areas in paris and its region that i could think of . 
  i 've seen it countless times . 
  amateurs ... 
  the difference being , compared to japan/france/uk , is that russia is considered to have a significantly more important military and nuclear arsenal . 
  i believe they 're ranked number 3 . 
  though i 'll grant that their military may be less professional and less well-equipped than that of developed and rich countries like ours , from what i read they 're still believed to be the 3rd ( or 2nd ? ), 
  most powerful . 
  i know gallo is breton . 
  i said it was a breton version of french . 
  but nantes is at a crossroad , however . 
  as i said , i 'd give it to brittany . 
  but it 's not true brittany imo . 
  i 'm being generous here , 
  do n't worry . 
  when it comes to blue collar or unskilled migrants , eastern european immigrants are among the least troublesome , along with south-east asians . 
   especially the kind of people doing unskilled or low-skilled jobs . 
  they 'd live 14 in 1 apartment , all the time eating ramen noodles , never assimilating one bit , undercutting locals in the job market , sometimes stealing and robbing . 
  i mean come on . 
  i can probably name half a dozen large ethnic groups that are worse offenders in all those areas than other europeans ... 
  if i dare say so ... apart from the roma .
