  oh shit , my bad . 
  i should have noticed the slashes which did imply that . 
  wow , that 's something . 
  did this discovery affect your previous opinions on things ? 
  like considering your asatru background ( assuming you were into it before knowing you had a jewish mother ) . 
  or more broadly your opinions , or interest if any , on the israeli conflict ? 
  yeah , i figured you 're just a cultural , or ethnic jew . 
  just kind of rare in my experience to meet a pagan jew . 
  especially asatru . 
  but otherwise the comment itself just seems to go opposite ways on first reading . 
  what do you mean by `` occidental '' ? 
  at first i thought you made a frenchism , and that you meant `` westerner '' ( because `` occidental '' in french , is basically `` westerner '' ) , but then you added westerner again . 
  i say i 'm french ( i 'm born and bred in the paris region ) . 
  if someone compliments my good american accent in english , i say it 's cause my mother 's american ( and thus so am i as well ) . 
  i often get asked what my origins are , people assume i 'm polish for some reason . 
  in those cases i answer that i have some norwegian origins ( my mother is american of mostly norwegian ancestry ) . 
  although i have origins from all over north-western europe and i approve of the idea of a european project , even federal , it would n't occur to me to say i 'm `` european '' . 
  not because i do n't think it can be a thing , but because it would be somewhat obnoxious . 
  like if someone said he was just `` arab '' to someone who asks where he 's from . 
  it 's not a precise enough answer . 
  and saying i 'm french implies naturally that i 'm european . . 
  was not expecting that . 
  haha, 
  damn , i thought someone gave me gold :(, 
  we did n't just try . 
  we managed to invade them , and hold them for a hundred years at least ... ` murican living up to his history ignorance stereotype :p, 
  yeah , that 's unsurprising , considering how big they are on a map . 
  but on a map of europe you ca n't see any significant lake in hungary . 
  i assumed that a lake too small to be represented on a map of the continent would have visible shorelines from one side to the other . 
  i definitely think `` first ladies '' should be sidelined . 
  they 're not the ones who were elected , they should have as little political influence as possible . 
  i like that in france we do n't care if a candidate is married , has children , and is a christian . 
  some `` first ladies '' have been spokeswomen for charities . 
  that 's fine , because their `` fame '' does make their voice louder . 
  they should n't be doing anything more than that . 
  hah , that would be too easy . 
  and also , one could argue that we would expect these sites in those parts of the world , though if one presents them as `` france '' it would be surprising . 
  the fuck ? 
  how big is that lake that you ca n't even see the other side ? 
  [ looks like an aerial view of london right ? 
  ] ( http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/replicate/exid51374/images/resized_anus_dog.jpg ) that 's actually a french dog 's anus . 
  charles de gaulle on the sign !, 
  yay !, 
  high five !, 
  here : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/boulevard_poniatowski, 
  i have no idea . 
  what 's weird is that i found that red mark on other pictures of it from the first page of google search , but not in most : http://cdn1.jaccede.net/uploads/places/imgs/full/sacre-coeur%5b1%5d.jpg http://bestparisrentals.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sacre-coeur-montmartre-paris2.jpg maybe it 's just one time when that substance was thrown out a window . 
  or it 's some recurrent ritual . 
  i do n't know . 
  yeah , measuring military experience by kill/death ratio is kind of weird . 
  i 'd rather measure it by number of troops used for military operations or something . 
  much , if not most of military operations is logistical and organisational . 
  so even troops which have n't seen combat in an operation still gained experience imo . 
  i never heard of `` marriage du loup '' but it sounds cool . 
  anyway , our equivalent for `` it 's raining cats and dogs '' is to say `` il pleut des cordes '' ( = it 's raining ropes ) . 
  well , it does n't really count because it 's a famous touristic site , but i 've always felt the [ sacr\u00e9 coeur ] ( http://verteco.pro/attachments/image/sacre-coeur-front.jpg?template=generic ) in paris looked very out of place . 
  it 's a catholic cathedral built in the early 1900s , but it looks like an orthodox church , with a mediterranean feel . 
  or maybe even some sort of indian temple for meditation or pilgrimage . 
  i do n't know , but it just looks out of place . 
  not to mention most train stations are in the cities , whereas many airports ( not all ) can be up to an hour away from cities . 
  what languages do you speak apart from portuguese and english ? 
  what european countries attract you the most on a personal level ? 
   la vend\u00e9e ? 
  dynamic ? 
  that farming backwater ? 
  uhhh . 
  maybe by local standards . 
  how horribly snobbish of you . 
  yes , the vend\u00e9e is dynamic no matter what your assumptions may be . 
  http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=18123 http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-region/2009-12-23/vendee-la-dynamique-les-secrets-d-une-reussite/1556/0/407765, 
  the main guy , philippe de villiers , is a eurosceptic nationalist who was elected in the fairly conservative vend\u00e9e d\u00e9partement in western france , and it was his electoral fiefdom for well over a decade . 
  one has got to admit though that he did something extraordinary there . 
  under his watch , that d\u00e9partement became the or one of the most dynamic in france . 
  he had this old castle there and wondered how he could develop it . 
  starting with humble amateur shows , he eventually developed a big ass theme park around it ( le puy du fou ) which consists of spectacular historical ( or a little fantastical ) reconstructions of battles from different time periods ( roman , medieval , viking . . ) , and was eventually named `` the best theme park in europe '' or something . 
  anyway , it 's hard to stop a private company from investing and dealing with russia on its own . 
  for sure , and i would n't have done this any way different . 
  especially considering it 's hard to determine if a place has been really continuously inhabited . 
  i do n't know for example if marseille was developed by greeks from a previous settlement . 
  probably not in that case though . 
  when it comes to french rock , or folk rock , of approximately the same time period , i really liked louise attaque . 
  my favorites would be [ tu dis rien ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewootkrikie ) , [ l\u00e9a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agjc0kapeya ) , and of course , their `` single '' and music video , [ j' t 'em m\u00e8ne au vent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0emxuhptwum ) . 
  according to archaeological evidence though , many cities come from older settlements . 
  for example many french cities which seem to have been founded by romans ( or greeks in the case of marseille ) were built off a previously established gallic oppidum for example . 
  it 's good to remember that the neolithic period , which brought sedentarization , appeared in europe at around 6000bp . 
  obviously , most settlements did n't survive from 6000 bp to today , but chances are some areas in europe have perhaps been continuously lived on for much longer than this list suggests . 
  you 'll find prehistoric artifacts in the sediment of many cities if given a chance to dig . 
  then again , i like flags with simple designs made of lines and circles and whatnot . 
  your suggestion would make it a pain to draw , with that laurel crown representation . 
  it would take time and effort for a drawing of it to give it justice . 
  that 's basically my standard for flags . 
  a flag needs to be simple enough for anyone to manage to draw it more or less correctly with simple strokes of a pen . 
  i consider the us and uk flags to be in that category of simple design , despite the numerous stars , or the lines going in every direction . 
  it 's just straight symbols or lines which do n't take much artistic talent to represent . 
  not because flags need to be drawn . 
  i 'm just using this ( `` can you draw it easily ? '' ), 
  as a standard for required simplicity . 
  i 've noticed there are quite a lot of metal fans on reddit . 
  something about metalheads ultimately being pretty geeky . 
  so this should come as no surprise ,
