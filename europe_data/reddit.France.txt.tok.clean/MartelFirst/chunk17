  i mostly listen to black and death metal , so i have too many to choose from . 
  but i 'll just throw out [ satyricon - mother north ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycxbh1hwpg ) cause it 's a genuinely good song , and the music video is not only hilariously old school , there 's a naked chick in it too ( edit : nsfw ), 
   r / ** europe ** , are there any ** latin ** words and ** phrases ** that are part of your ** language ** ? 
  i bolded the words in your ** question ** which come from ** latin ** . 
  i never ** studied latin ** , but i do speak french , so i know these words have a latin ** basis ** . 
  more seriously , i get what you 're asking . 
  you 're rather asking for latin expressions , or certain phrases which are clearly taken directly from latin . 
  not just an etymology thing . 
  and i 'd contend most european languages have these same latin expressions . 
  but to expand on your question , there are some expressions which are known as historical phrases . 
  they 're not used in everyday sentences , but are known . 
  in france , we know `` vae victis '' , which means `` woe to the vanquished '' , which is what the gallic leader brennus supposedly said to the romans when he sacked the city in 390bc . 
  then a more famous phrase is obviously `` veni , vedi , vici '' . 
  oh so that 's the one . 
  i remember it caused somewhat of a scandal . 
  but georges fr\u00eache was old school . 
  imagine when self-driving cars will be a thing . 
  you could program the car from england to romania . 
  it would take the eurostar on its own and cruise around back to your doorstep like it 's no thing . 
  ( only problem for now would be gas however ) . 
  statues are typically erected in public spaces to honor the person or event they 're depicting . 
  they 're not about solely educating the public to how a historical person looked like . 
  to answer op 's question , i 'm assuming most of the statues of lenin in western europe were erected by a left wing town counsel in the aftermath of ww2 , at a time when the left wing was still rather pro-ussr , before solzhenitsyn released `` the gulag archipelago '' in the 70s and the left wing in western europe thus started to distance themselves from anything related to russian communism . 
  haha , that 's awesome . 
  that side up they look like these huge chimneys in these industrial reactors or whatever they 're called . 
  there 's even a sequence with a plane flying above the towers . 
  it 's mostly a private group financing this , there 's not enough office space in paris proper , and this area which is la d\u00e9fense in the outskirts of paris is the biggest business district in europe . 
  also , in addition to offices , the building will house rather luxury apartments , and the rich typically are n't too hurt by the last crisis or current stagnation . 
  well `` aux '' is more multimeaning . 
  for example `` la cage aux folles '' literally means `` the cage of the crazy people '' , or `` the crazy people 's cage '' . 
  so `` la mort aux juifs '' can mean `` the death of the jews '' or `` the jewish people 's death '' ; where `` death '' is the subject noun of the phrase , and not the action `` death to jews '' . 
  kind of hard to explain . 
  it 's not a town , it 's a hamlet `` which consists of a farm and two houses '' . 
  anyway , i got ta admit i 'm shocked . 
  i remember seeing a similar story on reddit , maybe just a few months ago , about a village in spain with the same name in spanish . 
  it 's incredible we only hear of this now . 
  anyway yeah . 
  there 's a subtlety to the name due to the `` la '' in front of the title . 
  literally , the translation is rather `` the death to jews '' or `` the death of the jews '' . 
  i find that in french there 's an added subtlety which gives that name somewhat of a more ominous vibe , and it seems entirely possible that it 's not meant as an insult , but rather holds a dark historical testimony to it . 
  nonetheless , i do think the name should be changed because it is ambiguous . 
  i wonder if andorans can go to a french or spanish university without being considered foreigners or something . 
  must be a hassle . 
  approximately how long would it take to walk/hike from one end of the island to the other ? 
  with a population of some 400,000 or so , do you feel it 's limiting in some way ? 
  as in too small to meet every different kind of person ? 
  or does it simply feel like a big city ? 
  considering malta is the only european country which speaks a semitic language , and considering your geographical distance to the continent , is there any sentiment in malta of not being entirely european or something ? 
  being kind of apart ? 
  i remember something about the context being slightly relevant though . 
  something about the roma either calling him a nazi , or doing the nazi salute to him to insult him or something . 
  basically playing the `` you 're a nazi because you do n't want us to illegally squat land in your town '' game . 
  the mayor thus responded to sarcasm with sarcasm . 
  now it definitely was n't clever of him at all , and as an elected official he should show restraint . 
  but he surely responded emotionally and did n't control himself , was n't the one who brought up hitler/nazism in the first place , and went too far . 
  that fish and chips for the uk looks dry as fuck . 
  i 'd rather some delicious baked beans . 
  well it 's kind of like poutine in canada . 
  it 's really a quebec thing originally , but it 's big enough to be considered canada 's national dish now . 
  cr\u00eapes are largely spread enough around france for it to be considered a national dish . 
  though personally i would n't have chosen cr\u00eapes to represent france , and especially not a sugar desert cr\u00eape ( if it must be a cr\u00eape i would rather have chosen a more traditional and rustic [ dark wheat salty cr\u00eape ] ( http://www.ouest-cornouaille.com/upload/ble-noir-complete_creperie-menlanndu-xl.jpg ) . ), 
  dat great european plain from northern france to western russia . 
  great for invading armies . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i feel scolded , like i 'm responsible for irish debt . 
  yeah , i do realize that , but i naturally meant that it 's just the right size for train travel to be more practical than airplane imo . 
  if it were slightly larger , then airplane travel would be preferred . 
  but overall , i do think france is the perfect size for a country  . 
  it takes a day 's car ride to go from one end to the other . 
  so everything is reachable , but not too close either . 
  well some people do ride bikes to train stations of course . 
  but overall the bike riding culture is n't remotely close to what exists in the netherlands . 
  the city of paris has in the last decade or two been very liberal , and wanting to develop public transports , cleanliness , an environment-friendly city and all , but they have n't made any visible efforts to really improve bicycle safety and access . 
  i think they should really focus on that , and only then will people be encouraged to actually use bikes to get around . 
  in paris you can definitely live car free . 
  cars are actually a hassle in the city . 
  the metro system , and bus system , is very extensive and goes all over . 
  there 's probably not a place in paris which is n't maximum 10 minutes walking distance from a metro station . 
  strikes or whatnot are much rarer than the stereotype , though there may be occasionally some delays on a given metro line a few times a year because of a technical problem ( or a suicide ... ) . 
  the city and region ( including the suburbs ) is currently investing a lot to improve the metro and train system , building many more lines and stations , in paris and through the suburbs . 
  currently in the suburbs there are many train lines which go to paris , but unless you live next to a train station , you 'll probably need a car to get to the train station because the public rail system does n't cover all the suburbs as well as it does paris . 
  public buses cover enough of suburbs however , so they 're the preferred method of public transport for now . 
  paris has installed lots of [ city bicycles for rent ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/v%c3%a9lib%27.jpg ) . 
  but the city is n't bike-friendly . 
  there are rarely bicycle paths on roads . 
  to travel around in france , i usually take the high speed trains , and the regional trains . 
  it 's very effective and quick . 
  france is small enough for trains to be a faster means of transport than planes , considering the time to reach an airport ( which are typically in the distant suburbs of cities ) , and having to be there an hour or two earlier , whereas long distance train stations are in the center of cities and one does n't need to be there early or check out baggages and whatnot . 
  i think the government is very supportive of public transportation , and invests a lot in it . 
  and it 's a good thing . 
  my biggest complaint is that the metro system in paris closes too early ( at around 1am ) . 
  i wish at least the main axes would stay open all night . 
  and spread civilization to europe . 
  so it was a good cause , 
  i 'd also like to add that france bore most of the cost in human lives . 
  france puts its troops at risk for interventions which benefit many european ( and other ) companies who can only make a profit in a stable west africa . 
  france already pays most of the bills , and puts its own citizens in danger with ground troops , the least our allies can do is chip in a bit , which some have . 
  wait till you taste actually good cheese from your neighbors :d, 
  no they 're not , but they have been thoroughly reproduced . 
  i mean there 's a fake grottes de lascaux , with pretty faithful reproductions of the paintings in a genuine cave environment , and they 're a huge tourist attraction .
