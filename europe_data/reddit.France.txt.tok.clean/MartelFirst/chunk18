  whether one is willing to pay to visit what 's basically a very well done reproduction is up to the individual . 
  for having seen the reproduction , it 's still quite an entertaining ride and i would recommend it . 
  yes , i was pretty much torn with what to choose , and definitely considered rocamadour and other beautiful villages . 
  but i figured i 'd rather list things which are more exceptional . 
  there are other palaces , cathedrals and castles in europe , but few in the scale of versailles , the loire valley or notre dame . 
  whereas there are plenty of beautiful villages like rocamadour in other countries , notably italy !, 
  i did n't want to boast too much , but there 's a reason why france is the first touristic country . 
  however , to be fair , it also helps to be between germany/benelux and spain , and between the uk and italy . 
  so the `` tourists '' counted in the statistics are not only the people who come to visit us , but also those who have to go through our country to visit our very beautiful neighboring countries . 
  basically , it helps to be the central western european country .

  this one we share with our british friends . 
  edit : of course there 's the eiffel tower as well , which was a marvel at the time . 
  edit 2 : oh , as someone who has a degree in archeology specialized in prehistory , i feel bad for not mentioning the prehistoric [ lascaux ] ( http://www.petitebiblioronde.com/var/pbrenfant/storage/images/media/images/grotte-de-lascaux/grotte-de-lascaux-3/3648-1-fre-fr/grotte-de-lascaux-3_reference.jpg ) and [ chauvet ] ( http://lacavernedupontdarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo-drac-rh%c3%b4ne-alpes-minist%c3%a8re-de-la-culture-et-de-la-communication-41.jpg ) caves . 
  we 're lucky in france for sharing with spain , in the pyrenees , most of the most ancient preserved cave art of humanity . 
  [ can we tag along ? 
  ] ( http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2009/07/29/200907291386.jpg ), 
  no need to be sarcastic . 
  it 's not that obvious . 
  i mean we are on / r/europe , and our continent has had its share of civil wars ... 
  to be honest once with some friends in paris we got into some fight with more numerous clich\u00e9 euro street thugs who happened to be arabs , and as classic hoodlums they 're naturally the ones who started harassing us in the first place cause they have nothing better to do and wanted to impress eachother . 
  we were just students trying to have a nice night out . 
  when the police arrived these scumbags then cried racism , accusing us of having racially insulted them , which was ridiculous given the situation . 
  and it 's not the 80s anymore ... thankfully , the police are kind of used to this bullshit , and perhaps clearly saw that on the one side there was us , casual students just trying to have a good time , and the typical street thugs on the other hand . 
  it would be pretty ridiculous if we had looked for a fight against those idiots . 
  so i 'm glad to say that it does n't just take minorities to scream out hate crime for an experienced police to buy into that bullshit . 
  now one may answer that the police were racially profiling us all , and did n't believe the thugs ' accusation of racism because of their own prejudice . 
  i think they used good judgment , from long experience , and they were absolutely right in this case . 
  uh , no . 
  if you beat up someone specifically because he 's gay , it 'll be considered a hate crime . 
  if the assault had nothing to do with it , it 's considered a `` standard '' assault . 
  of course , one can consider the possibility that the attacker did n't attack someone for his sexuality or ethnicity , and will wrongfully be accused of a hate crime in addition to the assault , or the opposite , a real hate crime which was n't labeled as such because of taboo ( like , sorry to say this , some hate crimes against whites may be dismissed as not being hate crimes ) but that 's another subject and is more of a judiciary misjudgment than standard law . 
  it has some very nice haussmannian buildings , yes . 
  i do n't know about `` stunning '' really , but yeah it has some very classic and nice typically parisian buildings here and there . 
  i think it 's something like `` allons enfants de la patrie , le jour de gloire est arriv\u00e9 ... '' , but i 'm not sure :p, 
  it 's an early 1900s building , so it was made more or less in the style of the classic haussmann architecture ( which initially is an 1860s style or something ) , but more modest cause my building is early 20th century . 
  here in paris , i 'm facing a neighbour 's window which is some three meters away . 
  my windows only face the tiny inside courtyard of my building , and it really fucking sucks . 
  probably fixed me for life , and now i 'll take anything except such a close `` vis-\u00e0-vis '' as we call it . 
  that 's a nice looking pint . 
  i 'm actually surprised it 's only barely in the top 400 . 
  i mean how many more `` relevant '' subreddits can there be ? 
  ... and the dutch !, 
   also , the last 3 times a unified europe went against the uk , europe lost . 
  out of curiosity , when was that ? 
  i 'm not sure nazi germany counts ( it was basically going at it alone ) , nor even napoleonic france imo ( i mean did the british ever really have to fight the austrians , prussians , russians . . ? 
  except perhaps for little battles france forced its subjects to participate in ? 
  and i said nothing is cooler than the arc de triomphe , so you 're wrong . 
  there 's not only a pretender for the royal throne of france ( from the bourbon dynasty , picture there ) , but there 's also a pretender for the house of orl\u00e9ans dynasty ( which also can claim the french throne ) , and , you 'll be glad to know , for the bonapartist imperial throne . 
  though the bonapartist pretender is n't a descendant of napoleon i , but rather a grand-grand ( etc. . ) nephew ( and a descendant of a cousin of napoleon iii ( who himself was napoleon i 's nephew ) ) . 
  here 's his wikipedia article : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-christophe,_prince_napol%c3%a9on, 
  but seriously though , this is n't paris except the foreground . 
  nothing is cooler than the arc de triomphe . 
  austria 's looks like an opera house , estonia 's like a classroom , hungary 's and spain 's like a cathedral . 
  ( and malta 's like an airplane , and a classroom since there seems to be children in the seats on the right ), 
  yeah for sure . 
  the american part of my family , and other americans i met at the time had no part in this . 
  they even apologized to me on behalf of the ( probably ) few people who did . 
  the anti-french sentiment though , while not acted upon by most francophobes , was surely not a fringe thing . 
  i would n't be surprised if a large chunk of republicans at least shared this anti french sentiment . 
  but i 'll concede that with americans convinced that iraq had something to do with 9/11 , it 's somewhat understandable . 
  in france , demonstrations of francophobia in the us were actually reported quite a lot in the news ( people emptying french wines in the gutter , bashing their renault cars , and of course the freedom fries thing ... ) , cause from our perspective it was pretty insane . 
  but hopefully most french people realized it was a minority of crazies . 
  though to be honest , one would have a hard time finding seemingly normal people do this in other developed countries . 
  it 's kind of an `` only in america '' thing , even if it 's a huge minority among americans :p, 
  well , when it comes to france , we were against the invasion of iraq in the first place . 
  all this mess is due to the us and the `` coalition of the willing '' 's initial unprepared and stupid invasion , which has left the country worse than it initially was . 
  for those old enough to have been politically aware 10 years ago , france took a lot of shit from the us just because our government did n't agree with the invasion . 
  now we 're proven right . 
  so on the one hand , out of principle france should n't take part in this mess that it had initially warned against . 
  on the other hand , there now is a humanitarian crisis , what 's done is done , and maybe it can help save lives and rebuild . 
  so there 's a dilemma here . 
  the thing about the eiffel tower is that it has a limit to the number of people able to get in all at once , whereas disneyland 's limit is much larger . 
  yeah . 
  apparently the guy i know is in a french-speaking only unit . 
  i knew a guy , who 's french , and joined a belgian unit . 
  i do n't know if it 's a battle group , but apparently they accept french people . 
  but anyway , he joined them because he was n't accepted in the regular french army . 
  so not only do these battle groups not see any action , it 's probably for the better because in this case at least they have low standards . 
  anyway , i 'm not against battlegroups . 
  i think the idea is pretty cool . 
  however , they 'll see little use if we do n't have a common foreign policy . 
  or individual countries which have a common battlegroup may one day decide bilaterally that they both want to use military force , and then perhaps they 'll use the battlegroups . 
  but in the case of france for example , i 'm pretty sure the military command will rather want to use the reliable and experienced national units , rather than some fanciful battlegroups , to which also they probably do n't have full command over considering their multinational nature . 
  oh shit , where i actually got it wrong is that i thought those were imports to russia . 
  sure . 
  the us was in the big dick contest half a century ago ( hell , france was with the eiffel tower ) . 
  now it 's naturally more about efficiency . 
  if the us wanted to , it could easily top the dubai madness , which china and some south east asian countries are trying to catch up to as well . 
  kind of ridiculous if you ask me , but i must admit that skyscrapers are impressive structures . 
  i 'm still glad many classic european cities are spared , and comparatively , us cities are staying quite moderate and just building what 's necessary . 
  so on average it 's pretty much 50 % of everything russian people put in their mouths is from the eu . 
  that 's pretty massive . 
  oh i agree . 
  i work in a hostel in paris and actually tell the clients to go see the eiffel tower , but if they want to see paris from up high it 's better to go up the montparnasse tower . 
  no long queue , and more central . 
  this will probably hurt neighboring eastern european countries , to be honest . 
  but as a whole , yeah , it 's pretty ridiculous , and will surely hurt the russian people most .
