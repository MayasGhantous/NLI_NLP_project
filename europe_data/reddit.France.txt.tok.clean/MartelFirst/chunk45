  it 's still less than france which has a practically equivalent gdp . 
  however , i 'd say it 's balanced out because anglo-saxon countries have a much stronger culture for private sponsorship of research , or patronage . 
  i was under the impression that the guy dragging the unconscious cop was trying to help him . 
  to take his unconscious body away from potential harm . 
  daaaaaamn !, 
  ukrainian protesters showing how this is done !, 
  seriously though , that 's insane footage . 
  totally unrelated . 
  are you purposely playing stupid ? 
  because this is really boring . 
  uh , no that 's not my point . 
  and i did n't speak of industry ... 
  it does n't seem totally unlikely to me that dolphins , if never being killed while the rest of their ecosystem is , may increase in numbers and become a menace to their environment , because they 'll need to feed on fish , making their own environment unsustainable . 
  this happens a lot with , for example , introduced animals which do n't have a natural predator . 
  or with areas where the predator has been driven out ( like wolves in western europe ) , leaving deer and wild boar to reproduce so much that they regularly need to be killed off , for the sake of their own environment . 
  ultimately though , i do n't think dolphins will end up becoming `` pests '' . 
  i 'm simply explaining how these `` non-human person '' rights can have a backlash . 
  us humans may be the most responsible for environmental disasters , but it seems we 're also the only ones with the intelligence to think it over and try to fix it . 
  when i was studying archeology , one of my prehistory teachers considered we should give human rights to other great apes . 
  the key word , for those who have n't read the article , is that dolphins , great apes , and perhaps other animals , would be considered `` non-human persons '' . 
  thus , if they 're considered `` persons '' , self conscious individuals , technically , a defense can be made for granting them rights . 
  rights to live and be free . 
  i tend to agree with this , because i do find that the most intelligent animals on earth are precious , yet they 're often endangered , which is catastrophic . 
  however , this sort of thing may set a dangerous precedent . 
  let 's imagine these dolphins reproduce like mad , and become essentially `` pests '' by destroying their environment , eating all the other sea-life and ressources . 
  if they have `` human rights '' , we ca n't use pest control against them , although pest control is also a way to protect their species as well , ensuring that they do n't eat all of their own food . 
  dolphins are perhaps a bad example . 
  let 's take ravens and crows . 
  most subspecies are n't endangered . 
  it 's quite well know that these animals are highly intelligent , and could probably be considered `` non-human persons '' . 
  however , they 're also pests in certain cases , and thus need to be dealt with as such - so long as we do n't destroy the species . 
  agreed . 
  i 've always been surprised that anyone gives a shit about , say , polish immigration . 
  the same type of discourse with arab or african immigrants however , would be considered totally unacceptable , even though the truth is that with the latter , the problems are much more obvious . 
  on the other hand , poles , in a generation or less , are indistinguishable from the native population and entirely assimilated . 
  i 'm surprised by your flair `` citizen of earth '' , which i 'd typically not associate with someone posting those kinds of comments :p, 
  they look good . 
  would eat . 
  yeah , but if we call it use , when right wing americans chant `` usa !, 
  usa ! '', 
  it 'll sound like they 're saying `` use '' with a canadian accent . 
  so it 's a double whammy . 
  finally , [ our long lasting struggle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continental_system ) will come to be !, 
  the reason for you seeing more ripping on the top destinations is exactly because they 're `` famous countries '' , because they 're simply more well known . 
  no insult intended , but who 's gon na rip on , say , slovenia ? 
  this is why france , notably , was both one of the most hated , more than belarus , and most liked country in the survey on this subreddit . 
  because for the question `` which european country to you dislike the most ? 
  '' , who 's going to answer `` slovakia '' , except maybe some neighbors ? 
  the official definition of a `` tourist '' is usually that the person must stay at least one night in the destination . 
  i realize it does n't account for say , some germans living at the french border and visiting strasbourg for an afternoon and going back . 
  they 're clearly tourists . 
  similarly , some people stay a night at a destination although they 're not tourists . 
  but to make an official count of tourists , usually it 's the `` at least one night '' rule . 
  uh , i do n't know what those other guys are answering , but definitely . 
  we even call them our `` cousins '' . 
  of course qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are french diaspora . 
  admittedly though , it 's on an ethnic level . 
  culturally , the french and qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have indeed gone their totally separate ways . 
  indifference , sure . 
  but when it comes to historical diasporas , notably those who kept the language , quebec , i personally love them , and most french like quebec , which is why it 's a very popular destination for a year abroad . 
  technically , germany lost . 
  it was unable to continue financing the war , was left exhausted and alone . 
  it was losing ground , and decided to basically give up , hoping it would get a good deal in the armistice . 
  so britain , france and germany are throwing eachother punches endlessly , getting tired . 
  america arrives prancing , and joins france and britain in the punching , allowing france and britain to knock out germany 's friends . 
  tired , and seeing he 's outmatched and alone , germany gives up . 
  france , britain and the us mug him dry , saying they 'll need to buy new clothes because of him . 
  smaller countries can use immigrants too ... though i would n't advise it . 
  population decline can be curved and jump back , or stay sustainable . 
  population replacement through massive immigration is perminent . 
  france , with the current rate of immgration , will probably be unrecognisable in a hundred years . 
  estonia , even if the population halves , will still be estonia ( unless a jihad is launched from the islamic countries in western europe :d ) also , it 's not that much of a bad thing that the population in urban centers receives new residents from the same country 's other regions . 
  desertification of rural areas is n't great socially , but environmentally it 's nice :p it leaves more room for animals and nature to develop , and i find it 's a good thing . 
  dat baltic gdp growth since 2000 . . [ graph pic ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/maps_and_graphs/2011/8/17/1313582722744/the-former-ussr-graphic-001.jpg ), 
  i 'll also add , in addition to `` napoleon crossing the alps '' , those other famous and popular french paintings : [ the raft of the medusa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/jean_louis_th%c3%89odore_g%c3%89ricault_-_la_balsa_de_la_medusa_%28museo_del_louvre%2c_1818-19%29.jpg ) [ the death of marat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/death_of_marat_by_david.jpg ) [ the coronation of napoleon ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/jacques-louis_david%2c_the_coronation_of_napoleon_edit.jpg ) [ vercingetorix throws down his arms at the feet of julius caesar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg ) then there are many paintings the french would recognize , from being alive , or seeing them in their school textbooks and all , like this portrait of [ francis i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:francis1-1.jpg ) , which is perhaps the equivalent of the english [ henry the 8th famous portrait ] (, 
  well , i 'm pretty sure everyone wants fiscal responsibility really . 
  also , i do n't know how true this recent [ tyt video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvysrjiobt4 ) on how obama 's government dealt with the deficit , but they seem to be doing a rather better job than republicans have . 
  anyway , i 'm kind of like you . 
  i have personal ideas across the spectrum , depending on each individual issue , which makes it difficult for me to label my political opinion . 
  on some cases i 'm conservative , on others fairly progressive . 
  i dislike the idea that the first lady is practically a job . 
  in a similar vein , it 's sad that someone ca n't be elected in an important position if they 're not married , or if they 're atheists . 
  the super pac thing or whatever it 's called , where politicians can get private money for their campaigns , is democratically catastrophic . 
  the biparty system is way too strong in the us , though it 's a problem pretty much everywhere . 
  however , i was convinced that it 's not so bad , as the democrat and republican parties evolve themselves with their electorate and that ensures stability and moderacy ( twas a long argument , but it sounded good . . so i 'll give the biparty system somewhat of a pass ) . 
  i 'm no leftist , but the republican party has grown pretty much insane . 
  and by the way , the democratic party is n't left-wing for european standards , so it always sounds funny when some republicans go so far as calling obama a marxist . 
  i sometimes feel that if european politicians said the crazy shit some us politicians say , it would pretty much end their mainstream political career . 
  but maybe the reverse is true on other subjects . 
  maybe my opinions are biased by the sources i read concerning us politics . 
  but i did try , for example , to watch or read some republican press or something . 
  but they seem somewhat unreasonable . 
  he should maybe get a fine or something for not complying to storage rules or whatnot , but certainly , those weapons from the 1600s are antiques and he could sell them for a good price at an auction . 
  it would be pretty unfair if they were really confiscated . 
  i understand confiscation for modern assault weapons though . 
  i 'm all for scottish independence if the scottish people vote for it . 
  but it 's not `` bullying '' them to say they ca n't keep the sterling . 
  it 's not `` bullying '' them to say they 'll have to reapply to the eu , or any other things they 'll lose with independence . 
  it 's totally normal , and they should n't expect to keep all this . 
  be careful when using the word liberal though , as in the us is means progressives , whereas in much of europe it means capitalists .
