  i 'm guessing he 's trying , and failing , to be humorous . 
  it would be funnier , i guess , if he had some assumptions right , but many are pretty ludicrous . 
  the french one has a [ faggot ] ( http://www.themonolith.com/wp-content/uploads/bundleofsticks.jpg ) and an axe . 
  which is somewhat weird . 
  i know those are republican symbols too , but i always associate faggots and axes with fascism . 
  [ fascist italy ] ( http://historybuffz.wikispaces.com/file/view/800px-italian_fascist_flag.svg/76274673/640x425/800px-italian_fascist_flag.svg ) , [ vichy france ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/flag_of_philippe_p%c3%a9tain,_chief_of_state_of_vichy_france.svg ) . 
  the `` chance of federal guilt for 9/11 '' question kind of bothered me . 
  i answered `` no '' because i assume the question is if we consider that the us government planned the attack . 
  i do n't think they did , but i think they 're guilty of incompetence . 
  they were aware that something like that was planned , and did n't react to the threat . 
  in that sense they 're guilty . 
  there are two dishes i want when i celebrate christmas or new years : [ oysters ] ( http://media.europe1.fr/images/media/fichiers/infos/france/repas-noel-pretexte-maxppp-930620/23837315-1-fre-fr/repas-noel-pretexte-maxppp-930620_scalewidth_630.jpg ) or [ snails ] ( http://www.frenchmomentsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/escargots-de-bourgogne-01-french-moments.jpg ) . 
  both tables are quite representative of usual dinner celebrations in france . 
  they try to look somewhat classy , though there can be a more rustic side to it . 
  well , the front page of french google still has [ that statement ] ( http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/adam/58927c3185f07e345c5df8058a87476a/google-france-2014-02-08-02.jpg ) ( about being fined 150,000 euros for invasion of privacy ) which was forced on them by french courts . 
  so it 's somewhat funny that they 're fighting over the relatively tiny sum of money , while still agreeing to display to all of france that they were condemned for invasion of privacy . 
  if they really want to fight it , i 'd say they should erase that embarrassing statement from their front page . 
  i mean , when i went on the internet this morning and saw this , i was shocked . 
  edit : oh , i just read the update of the article . 
  so their appeal resulted in them being forced to publish the statement of guilt . 
  it 's good to know , that huge ass companies like google still have to obey democratic governments ' laws . 
  however , if google held a grudge , they could hurt france 's economy badly . 
  i 'll start with famous political quotes from france , which any frenchman should have heard of :  `` je vous ai compris ! '' -- translation : `` ** i understood you ! ** '' . 
  from a 1958 speech when charles de gaulle obtains full powers because of the algerian war . 
  very ambiguous phrase , and most from every side thought he was talking about them . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/0l1eynohy1a?t=5m54s ) '' -- translation : `` ** long live free quebec ** '' president charles de gaulle during his 1967 visit to canada , to a crowd of qu\u00e9becois . 
  naturally , this became a diplomatic scandal between france and canada . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=munf-v8wqv8 ) '' -- translation : `` ** you do n't have a monopoly on heart/love ** '' . 
  presidential candidate val\u00e9ry giscard d\u2019estaing towards presidential candidate fran\u00e7ois mitt\u00e9rand during the presidential debate of 1974 . 
  mitt\u00e9rand , socialist , insinuated that the capitalist ways of d\u2019estaing , center-right , were heartless . 
  d\u2019estaing answered this quote . 
  he won the election , and some say he won thanks to this response . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ajgqtphfk ) '' - translation : `` ** goodbye ** '' . 
  president val\u00e9ry giscard d\u2019estaing 's last televised word as president , in 1981 . 
  he lost his reelection against the previously mentioned mitt\u00e9rand . 
  it 's famous because it 's somewhat humorous and awkward , as you can see in the video . 
   `` [ le bruit et l\u2019odeur ] ( http://youtu.be/e4pun9cdp6q?t=38s ) '' -- translation : `` ** the noise and smell ** '' . 
  mayor of paris jacques chirac during a speech in 1991 , criticizes the immigration policy , describes the plight of the french people when they see large families of immigrants getting a lot of money from welfare , and it 's even more bothering if we add `` the noise and smell '' from said immigrants . 
  naturally caused a scandal . 
  on va vous en d\u00e9barrasser ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs2tiewzwxi ) '' -- translation : `` ** you 've had enough of these hoodlum gangs ? 
  we 'll get rid of them ** '' . 
  candidate sarkozy in 2005 , speaking to a resident who told him she 's had enough with the youth gangs . 
  this provoked a scandal , and was considered racist , because of the term `` racailles '' which is n't classy . 
  the term is equivalent to the english `` chavs '' , though it 's mostly associated to black or arab youths . 
  but in truth , he repeated the resident 's phrase , who was some muslim-arab herself . 
  a similar quote/scandal from him , in 2005 , is that he said he 'll `` ** clean the neighborhood with a k\u00e4rcher ** '' , refering to some ghetto/bad neighborhood . 
  ca n't find a video for that . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdpnkmzycvc ) '' -- translation , basically `` ** bugger off , asshole ** '' . 
  again , an unclassy one from sarkozy . 
  president sarkozy was visiting the 2008 agriculture exhibit in paris . 
  he was shaking hands and one random person said `` do n't touch me , you 'll make me dirty '' . 
  and sarkozy answered this . 
  it made the front news . 
  i know norway is n't desperate for money , but it 's fairly tragic when a country which already has the infrastructure and means to host such events , rejects tourist money . 
  as a frenchman studying tourism , i know about this . 
  so much easy money in tourism , but people do n't realize it and would rather reject it . 
  what a waste . 
  in comparison , when countries like brazil get the olympics or world cup , it causes a huge fiesta , because the people in those developing countries realize how lucky they are . 
  how a project like this will develop their infrastructure , and by extension their business , and how money will flow from tourists . 
  as someone with a degree in archeology , specialized in neanderthals , we say `` human '' for any species belonging to the `` homo '' family , assuming that the reader understands that actual homo sapiens appeared some 150,000 years ago . . 
  so we know any earlier date is n't about homo sapiens , but about a species in the homo family . 
  so i must say i would n't bat an eye if i read about `` human '' settlement in brittany 500,000 years ago , because i naturally understand they 're talking about an ancient species . 
  i just wanted to say that , while the media often hilariously makes mistakes when they report on scientific discoveries , in this case , saying `` human '' is n't a mistake , as it 's largely used the same way in scientific papers . 
  half the page to actually get to a transcript of the insult . 
  i hate it when articles try to build the suspense like that . 
  the subject of the controversy should be in the first fucking paragraph !, 
  well , esa is financed by 24 % by france and germany respectively , so almost 50 % from these two countries alone ( the next highest is italy at 13 % , the uk is at 10 % ) , the launch site is in french guiana , the construction and engineering is mostly done in toulouse , and most employees are actually french ... so you 're god damn right the countdown is in french !, 
  if i trust the reports i 've seen on the subject , black people are treated quite poorly in north africa , not necessarily by the governments ( though it 's the case ) , but by the general population . 
  but ultimately , europe is simply more attractive . 
  many have some very crazy ideas . 
  they see western tv shows where bartenders earn enough money to own a very nice apartment , they see adds with happy european families , and luxury and whatnot . 
  however , i do believe most know that it would be hard for them in europe still , but they still think it would be better than africa , and they want to take a shot towards that dream . 
  most here think we have the silliest accents . 
  not their girlfriends though . 
  ( let the downvoting begin ! ), 
  i get some of your points , though most results are quite equally divided , but i do n't see how not wanting turkey in the eu has anything to do with not being progressive . 
  also , not everyone in / r/europe boasts about being progressive . 
  i do n't view being `` progressive '' as something constantly good . 
  i 'm `` progressive '' on certain issues , and not on others . 
  damn , there are so many poles in this subreddit ? 
  how is that ? 
  what the . . ? 
  i 'll add that in the latest polls for the ep elections , the euroskeptic fn is credited to have the most votes . 
  not 50 % , far from it , but the strongest number of votes , as the rest are divided between all the other parties . 
  then again , one ca n't consider that everyone who votes for the fn is necessarily against the eu , or the idea of a eu . 
  yeah , the `` merci , aurevoir '' just comes naturally . 
  us french are actually very polite people , despite the reputation . 
  always with the `` hellos '' and `` thankyous '' and `` do n't mention its '' ... 
  chinese people be like : `` whaaaat ? 
  it 's not accepted to fart loudly in public ? '', 
  oh yeah , there are many other situations when you got ta say `` hello '' . 
  when you go to the doctor 's waiting room , just throw in a `` hello '' to everyone who 's waiting there too . 
  france , or at least the paris region : say `` hello '' to everybody you encounter , before anything else . 
  the server in a bar , the cashier in a supermarket , the employee in a shop , or anyone you cross paths with in your apartment building . 
  also say `` goodbye '' when you 're done in a shop/supermarket . 
  we learned a little about vikings . 
  otherwise sweden is perhaps mentioned as being neutral during ww2 , and that it 's now in the eu ( and we 're required to know its capital is stockholm ) . 
  maybe it 's rapidly mentioned in a few other wars , but ultimately we do n't learn anything significant about sweden . 
  agreed . 
  it has space ships and stuff !,
