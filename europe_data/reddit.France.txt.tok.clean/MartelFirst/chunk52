  i suppose most people do . 
  so seeing `` france '' written can get confusing . 
  though ultimately , `` slovenia '' is written as well . 
  i find it weird that there 's `` france '' written on the slovene coin to be honest  i 'm pretty sure some people get confused . 
  belgium has such a prolific comic book `` industry '' , they have many fictional characters to choose from which at least were created by actual belgians . 
  tintin for example . 
  i personally like french , german and irish most , though the latter could have a little diversity between the coins . 
  and , like most people here , the monarch heads coins are the least interesting to me . 
  estonia 's is pretty uninspired as well ( just an outline of the country ... ) . 
  in france we naturally encounter spanish , german , italian and belgian coins the most . 
  otherwise , we regularly see almost all the other coins , though admittedly , the micronations ' coins are rare . 
  really ? 
  i find the birds and flowers on the finnish 1 and 2 euro coins very uninspired . 
  the lion on the finnish cents is pretty nice though . 
  how dare you insinuate that a flan is spanish !, 
  i personally do n't think he should be punished at all if it 's `` hate speech '' . 
  however i 'm for punishment if it 's calls for violence , though one could say there 's a thin line between the two . 
  i would n't say france is the outcast , but rather the one who talks to everybody and hangs out with everybody and feels like he 's part of everything , to an extent that he never stays long enough with one person to make a close friend , but is still integrated enough with everyone to not be rejected , and to not feel like a loner outcast . 
  norway is the depressive goth , even though he has \u00fcber rich parents . 
  i 'm pretty sure you could call fascist italy a fascist country and the fascist government would n't bat an eye , 
  yeah , same goes for some vichy french officials who were only charged for their war-crimes decades later . 
  most notably maurice papon , who was only starting to be charged in the early 1980s ... while he was a minister of the government !, 
  greece has a much smaller military capacity and budget than the uk and france , and lacks nuclear deterrence . 
  i know greece spends more on its military on average , relative to gdp . 
  that 's good . 
  greece is a good student in that regard . 
  but ultimately , i 'm sorry , greece is n't enough on it 's own , without nato and eu backing . 
  france is n't either , mind you . 
  oh , and you 're welcome for our support for your independence . 
  ps : france kicked invading italian 's asses just as easily as the greeks did , and we were fighting the germans at the same time . 
  and i can also uselessly quote adolf hitler you fucking dipshit : `` it 's another proof of the theory i 've always defended , that the french are , after us , the best soldiers of europe . 
  france will always be in a situation , even with their current birth rate , to form a hundred divisions . 
  after the war , we will absolutely need to build a coalition capable of containing militarily this country capable of accomplishing such military feats which astonish the world like in bir hakeim '' . 
  - 1942 do n't let your apparent hate-fueled rage and irrationality step into this argument . 
   we really do n't have any tangible threats and why 's that , do you think ? 
  because usa/nato , and because the uk and france are around , and have shown their capacity to intervene , and have military deterrence . 
  not everything works on diplomacy alone , not to mention that respectable armed forces , military and nuclear capacity , are political assets , no matter how sad that fact is . 
  if all countries in the eu had the military commitment of ireland , we may as well give up the eastern half to russia , and the western half to the us - and i do n't think what i 'm saying is that much of an exaggeration . 
  of course not . 
  you 're lucky the us has your back , and you 're lucky to be in a union which includes countries which have a military worth a damn like france and the uk , or countries like turkey and russia would be stepping all over you , and your interests . 
  from what i 've heard from ukrainian protesters , they simply want closer ties with the eu rather than with russia , because they consider that the eu will help end the corruption in their country , and is an opposition to russia . 
  i remember one protester even considering the eu was more like the `` lesser of two evils '' . . 
  it had nothing to do with being more pro-eu than pro-ukrainian as op suggests . 
  they consider it 's better for the ukraine to have closer ties with the eu . 
  and ukraine which is smack in the middle of both superpowers has to pick a side regardless . 
  to be honest though , most mainstream music we hear in france is either french or from an anglo-saxon country ( mostly us and uk ) . 
  there are of course some notable bands/artists from other european countries , but they 're pretty much dwarfed by anglo-saxon music , and national music . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the same all over europe . 
  you mentioned a couple famous german bands . 
  personally , i ca n't name many more from other european countries ( i 'm speaking about fairly mainstream bands . . then i listen to metal so of course , i thus know many european bands , but only metal bands . . 
  i 'm pretty sure those who know another subculture , like techno and all , know their fair share of non-anglo-saxon bands as well ) . 
  i mean , do you know any current french mainstream artist ? 
  maybe superbus ? 
  i hear they 're somewhat known out there . 
  they made it to guitar hero , so that 's something i guess . 
  yeah , that particular sketch might resonate in this subreddit :p though one still needs to understand french to get the jokes . 
  [ norman ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/normanfaitdesvideos/videos ) is by far the most popular so i guess it should be linked . 
  otherwise , for classic sketches like monty python , in france there 's [ les inconnus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/les_inconnus ) who were huge in the late 80s and 90s . 
  i think they 're brilliant . 
  they do typical french humor though , so i do n't know if they 're for everyone . 
  but many frenchmen can quote some of their lines . 
  that dish looks fucking good !, 
  i definitely recommend `` un proph\u00e8te '' , for a good recent gangster/prison film . 
  also , in a similar genre : [ mesrine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mesrine_%282008_film%29 ) is a two-part film about a real life french gangster who was involved in many incredible heists . 
  good films , with vincent cassel . 
  i have n't seen the last one , but the first two films are definitely very enjoyable . 
  they 're also the most european films ever , as the main theme of these films is being european - and it 's thus a multilingual film , though french , and english , are the most used languages . 
  what bothered me with `` casse-t\u00eate chinois '' at first glance is that it strays away from europe per se , at least in its title . 
  but that 's perhaps the point of the movie . 
  maybe something about there being globalisation beyond just europe . 
  yeah . 
  i knew this guy from my university , in his twenties , who was a native speaker of breton . 
  not a dialect of french of course , but a regional language . 
  i thought that was pretty cool , especially considering he did n't just learn breton in school , but spoke it with his parents . 
  thanks . 
  i merely put in bold the words which are ** identical ** or very ** similar ** in french , though i would n't know which came from the french ** influence ** , and which came ** directly ** from latin . 
  i live in paris . 
  we have a distinct `` argot '' often called `` titi parisien '' , which is to french what `` cockney '' would be to english i guess . 
  parisian argot is mostly dead , though many of the argot words entered common french vocabulary , though these words are still considered familiar speak . 
  like cockney , there was also a special way of speaking like a lower class parisian , and it usually involved quite a strong nasal sound in the way they speak . 
  this can be heard in old french movies , or in edith piaf for example . 
  i do n't know if you 're giving an ** explanation ** or really ** posing ** the ** question ** , but yeah , after the norman ** invasion ** of britain , the french ( or rather franco-norman ) ** language ** was for a long time the ** language ** of ** nobility ** , and this ** influenced ** english ** vocabulary ** ** significantly ** . 
  ( words in bold in this ** comment ** are words which i 'm guessing are ** derived ** from french ), 
  normans by 1066 were a mix of the franco-gallic indigenous populations and the francisized vikings . 
  the latter were much less numerous . 
  according to your logic , everything france did is actually credit to the romans who did have colonies and bred with locals throughout gaul . 
  `` gaul are gallo-romans and so , technically romans . 
  romans won the battle of verdun . '', 
  maybe if we maintain a massive canal to rotterdam it would still survive as an inland port . 
  it is indeed cheaper and faster to transport things by water , so it would make sense to have those canals in place . 
   i managed to get out of it and on the road man , i gave up after 5 minutes :d, 
  50 km is n't bad at all . 
  when i was a kid my father took me to visit loire valley castles a lot , so i instantly recognised it had to be one of them , and i got pretty close too , but i assumed it would be much harder for foreigners to even recognise it 's a loire castle . 
   western nations in general have a habit of bringing misery and destruction to others when we give ourselves lots of guns oh please , your comment was doing fine until you decided to add this ridiculousness . 
  i say we let everyone who wants in ( according to my calculations , that would account to over a billion people ) . 
  we 'd be bred out in a generation , but maybe we can have little `` reservations '' for the native populations , and they can have their cute little political council and stuff . 
  does `` tech '' mean exclusively phones ? 
  because otherwise there are many other high tech european companies . 
  we learn it 's in europe , but not in the eu , and was neutral since the end of the napoleonic wars , and that 's basically it . 
  lol .
