  thanks . 
  they actually do exist on french keyboards but i could n't be bothered to be honest , 
  i 'm not sure non-french people will understand this reference . 
  so i 'll explain : ex-presidential candidate sarkozy famously said he 'll clean crime-neighborhoods with [ karcher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%a4rcher ) . 
  since then , in france the brand is associated [ with him ] ( http://perlbal.hi-pi.com/blog-images/65003/mn/1250866494/mr-nicolas-sarkozy-un-coup-de-karcher-sur-le-tour-de-france-avenir.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know how happy or not the people of karcher are , but it 's great publicity . 
  france : - you can avoid violent crime by sticking to the touristic areas ( but beware of pickpockets , or `` youths '' on bikes who sometimes just take your photo camera or phone and ride off ) . 
  and rural areas are fine . 
  - do n't try to bribe any french officials , and the same is valid for any western european country i presume . 
  - no visit through france is complete without seeing the mont saint michel , paris , loire valley castles . 
  then there are tons of other things to see of course . 
  since you want to avoid paris , and big cities , i 'd suggest riding along the west coast , through normandy to the mont-saint-michel , to brittany , and down the loire valley . 
  - you should obviously try fresh morning baguette and croissants , and wine , and casual french food in a caf\u00e9 . 
  also crepes . 
  and camembert cheese in normandy . 
  - if you want help from a frenchman , first and foremost ask them if they speak english . 
  you can ask the question in english , but it should be the first thing you say to them . 
  casual chat is somewhat unusual though . 
  lucky to have not participated in ww2 , 
  i 'd rather say a very vocal minority hated sarkozy , and hated him deeply . 
  but before he was president , polls never showed sarkozy to be unpopular to over 50 % of the electorate . 
  actually there was a huge movement behind him . 
  i 'm not trying to defend sarkozy however . 
  also , it seems hollande is disliked more now than sarkozy ever was . 
  if this situation continues , hollande probably wo n't even try for a second turn , which i believe would be the first time this happens in the 5th republic . 
  for real though . 
  the guy is so fucking awkward . 
  in photos with other leaders of great countries , he often looks totally out of place . 
  also : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiqgcqwe6ky, 
  they do have a large army , but they also have a tiny country with no minerals and no economic importance , or influence even amongst their `` allies '' . 
  so no one actually cares to `` liberate '' them . 
  he probably does n't care , but i wonder if he knows he 's a laughing stock . 
  english aside , i learned spanish in school cause it 's somehow the trend . 
  no disrespect for spaniards intended , but i regret not taking german instead . 
  a much more useful language in europe . 
  though admittedly , i currently work in tourism and thus spanish is quite useful considering many latin-american and spanish tourists only speak spanish , whereas germans and austrians at least have a good level in english . 
  they 're such a farce of a government , i often wonder if kim jong un , who spent some time in switzerland and thus presumably has an understanding of western culture , understands how much of a joke he and his country 's government looks to everyone else . 
  it 's all those swedish immigrants i tell ya !, 
  seriously , whenever there are popular festivities , be it the new year 's , the technoparade , some football victory ( like paris ' not long ago ) or whatnot , the `` youths '' are always around to ruin the party , and for no other reason than to ruin it for everyone . 
  france is doing `` just fine '' . 
  it 's not doing great , it 's just hanging on there . 
  it 's certainly not to be put in the same category as greece or spain . 
  same goes for italy i presume . 
  if economies like france and italy had been in the same hole as greece for example , the crisis would be at a whole other level . 
  [ millau viaduct ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/a/a6/viaducdemillau.jpg ) [ 500 euro bill ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/eur_500_reverse_%282002_issue%29.jpg ) this could be a fun game , 
  i 've seen plenty of gypsies and roma from those countries who do n't fit that description . 
  but i 'll grant it for the ethnic romanians and bulgarians . 
  that 's actually not really true . 
  just occasional personal experiences coupled with the fact that french car brands are affordable , and then it became a stereotype . 
  but considering many motors from expensive and affordable cars come from the same factories , there 's no actual significant difference between them . 
  when an expensive car brakes down , it 's just because you forgot to let the motor heat for 5 minutes before driving it . 
  when a cheap car brakes it 's because it 's shit . 
  yeah , but i get the stereotype for german police , because nazis , i get it for british food being bad , and italian food being good , and whatnot . 
  i 'm just wondering where the bad french mechanic stereotype comes from , and i 'm just guessing it 's because the french do n't make expensive cars ... 
  i also do n't see where the stereotype of the swiss being poor lovers comes from . 
  maybe it 's because the swiss do n't really sound very sexy , but still , i do n't think a swiss sounds less sexy than germans , or bulgarians , or whatever . 
  they just do n't have a sexy vibe , and most nations do n't . 
  i used to work for a firm which sold a computer program which helped users organize their stock market portfolio . 
  in french , the stock market is called `` la bourse '' . 
  a `` bourse '' also means a `` scholarship '' . 
  so we 'd regularly get emails and calls from some hopeful africans who read `` bourse '' on our website and thus figured they could just ask us to pay for their education in france . 
  for some reason it totally pissed me off . 
  these people did n't take 5 minutes to understand we 're not giving out money like some fucking charity , but rather working in the stock market . 
  i guess they just send those poorly written emails to any website which says `` bourse '' in it , like some fucking awkward hyenas smelling dead flesh . 
  not to mention that even if they sent those shitty emails to universities , there 's no way they 'd get a scholarship with their piss-poor one-paragraph arguments which were basically `` hi , i 'm nigerian and i want to study biology in france , please pay for my studies '' , as if we ca n't wait to pay for foreigners ' education . 
  it 's like they think in europe money grows on trees . 
  ataturk is surely a respectable guy , but the turks have voted for an islamist-oriented party last time and are loosing their great secular past , and they have been pretty much unreasonable lately . 
  i 'm willing to admit they 've been given a harder time to enter the eu than other countries based on the fact that most of their country is n't in fucking europe , not to mention that cyprus situation , but ultimately they simply have n't met eu standards . 
  they 're thus pissed off about it and now claim they never wanted to be in the eu in the first place ( classic symptoms of rejection ) and have thus made a full u-turn towards the western world . 
  obviously , much of the turkish population is still favorable to western ideals and whatnot , but they 're currently loosing the majority . 
  i 've been browsing around , and according [ to this ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/55/group/11/response/enemy/ ) , the turks are 49 % to consider the us are their enemies . 
  i think turks are crazy . . 
  i 'm glad they 're not in the eu . 
  i mean , all their answers in these surveys seem really unreasonable . 
  i was thinking the same for china . 
  what do they fucking care ? 
  by the way , a clearer map for this kind of thing is the `` unfavorable '' map ( click on the top right of the map ) . 
  because not everyone who did n't vote `` favorable '' necessarily have a bad opinion about the eu . 
  pakistan only has 22 % unfavorable . 
  also , i suspect countries are n't voting for the same reasons . 
  some are voting for the eu as an institution ( that 's what i assume european respondents are voting for ) , others are voting for or against the countries which compose the eu . 
  hollande 's one year anniversary as president . 
  i know it 's a joke and all , but i do n't get the french mechanics stuff . 
  it 's not because french car brands do n't have luxury in their business model that france sucks in mechanics . 
  france does most of the esa and airbus work , not to mention all that high speed train business . . 
  but it 's not like i 'm complaining . 
  i 'm all for having the monopoly on love making and letting the others do all the actual work . 
  and the least arrogant is picking yourself as most arrogant , effectively making france the least arrogant . 
  news flash : most tourists , wherever they go , have no idea and do dumb shit . 
  here 's one where he specifically talks about the controversies surrounding him ( notably how le pen is his daughter 's godfather ) - he by the way uses that `` quenelle '' sign right in the beginning and not towards the jews , but the media . . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnjtfrytkq however , i 've seen this reaction before with friends who used to like him , and it will probably be your case ; because you probably dislike him for the controversy surrounding him , you most certainly will not find him funny there , as you 're not open to him , or to laughing with him - which is very understandable . 
  i have a hard time finding french comedians who talk about sensitive stuff . 
  he 's probably the only known one who does . 
  otherwise i have to turn to anglo saxon comedians to get comedy which is n't about sending sms and boring stuff like that . 
  edit : this is the beginning of his first show after the controversy started . 
  it 's quite something ( there 's laurent ruquier in the audience btw ) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzs-vaeq8re, 
  i love dixie land . 
  i actually listen to it regularly . 
  for some reason , i love southern usa culture . 
  i think he was ^ and ^ still ^ is hilarious . 
  he has perfect delivery .
