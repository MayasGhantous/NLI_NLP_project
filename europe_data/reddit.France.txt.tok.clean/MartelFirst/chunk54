  it 's not a nazi salute . 
  it 's literal meaning is `` look at how much arm length i stuck up your ass '' . 
  the people using it mostly use it to denote they 're anti-system . 
  the guy who invented this sign is largely considered an anti-semite , so people who have no understanding of the history of the joke ( because it 's basically a joke ) consider it 's some kind of nazi sign , and it 's ridiculous to see how much importance they give to what 's basically a joke . 
  actually , to be honest , i do n't think the `` quenelle '' should be described as `` an inverted nazi salute '' . 
  the foremost specialist of the `` far right '' in france , mr camus , agrees that the `` quenelle '' is specific to the movement dieudonne created , which is indeed largely an anti-system movement , and ultimately , it 's a fucking joke . 
  it literally means `` look at the size of the arm i stuck up your asshole '' . 
  i realize dieudonne was accused of antisemitism , but it does n't mean everything he does is related to nazism . 
  the `` quenelle '' basically means `` up yours '' , and the fact the media get so uptight about it is simply ridiculous , and they 're giving more credit to it than it should have ever had in the first place . 
  wow . 
  that 's got to be one of the most irresponsible things i 've seen from a high representative of a country that 's not north korea . 
  i know what you 're saying , but `` technically '' , the french grande arm\u00e9e got to moscow , and the russians had abandoned it to them . 
  so the french did occupy it . 
  they eventually left this fiery barren wasteland which was moscow , but it was still theirs for a time :p, 
  i do n't know if you 're talking about modern songs , but `` classic '' and `` best songs ever made '' , which every frenchman should at least recognize , include those : edith piaf ( though she was very successful internationally ) : - [ padam , padam ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmyb0si2x84 ) - [ non , je ne regrette rien ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3kvu6kgp88 ) - [ la foule ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyegd1cem-q ) - [ le vie en rose ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zfc7nijnvo ) charles trenet - [ douce france ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iit3kabs7qa ) jacques brel is actually belgian , but he sang in french and was hugely popular here , `` adopted '' if i may , and in that sense is also part of our culture . 
  he wrote some of the most tragically beautiful love songs ever , if you understand french : - [ amsterdam ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2kkr0e_dtq ) . 
  such a brilliant performance - must watch - and there are even english subtitles . 
  the ending especially gets very intense so i encourage people to watch to the end . 
  - [ la chanson des vieux amants ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1dpjxqudsi ) - [ ne me quitte pas ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2wmkcbm4ik ), 
  was there actually a time when it was more the case than today ? 
  ( granted perhaps , for the fraternit\u00e9 part . 
  people are probably more divided today than during some other time ), 
  so did france ultimately . 
  only germany did n't manage to actually occupy moscow . 
  aw , you 're not even trying . 
  kind of disappointing . 
  you 've been repeating the same thing for the last 5 comments at least . 
  show some diversity !, 
  be imaginative !, 
  you can keep going on saying over and over again that i 'm whining , it wo n't change the reality that there 's only one person here who 's even remotely whining , and it 's not me . 
  you should look up the definition of whining . 
  whining for example is wanting to blame the french and then being rage fueled when a french guy refuses to take the blame you want him to take . 
  ps : i did n't say `` we won '' in the sport example you gave . 
  i said `` france won '' . 
  and yes , i would say `` france won '' . 
  ps 2 : i do n't think you understand the basic difference we have here , which all comes back to your very first comment . 
  you implied that you feel sorry for everyone else , but not the french people because it 's their fault . 
  i did take it personally since it seemed you mostly had something against the french , and since i am french it 's difficult for me to not take it personally . 
  then , your series of ragefull comments directly insulting the french proved how right i actually was . 
  you were the first to say `` when i reach adulthood '' , and you keep saying i 'm whining although you 're obviously the only one in full blown out rage-mode here . 
  now i 'm just thinking you 're trolling . 
  i did n't even read past your second sentence . 
  ssshhh , go to sleep little boy . 
  everything 's going to be ok . take a pill . 
  wow , you 're a fucking psycho . 
  you said the french and you 're telling me to take responsibility . 
  the swedes also voted for pro eu parties . 
  take responsibility and excuse yourself . 
  you could say `` france '' did that . 
  but do n't say `` the french '' and blame them for everything , while feeling sorry for the others . 
  and then have the balls to ask me to personally take responsibility . 
  you clearly have a problem against the french . 
  i do n't blame americans for having voted for people who spied on them . 
  the french voted against the lisbon treaty and got fucked over like everyone else dickwad . 
  you 're the only whining here btw . 
  i accept responsibility for things i 'm actually responsible for . 
  i 've never voted for a pro european candidate . 
  but ok , i 'm sorry for personally inventing the euro and forcing the weaker nations to accept our all powerful will , sorry for forcing the weak and oppressed into the eu , sorry for nuclear testing , sorry for not resisting the nazis well enough , sorry for the versailles treaty , sorry for napoleon , sorry for decapitating austrian royalty , and sorry for louis xiv . 
  i accept the responsibility and beg for your forgiveness . 
  yes , i do say `` france won '' if they win in some sport . 
  but i do n't say `` the french won '' . 
  the main point here is that you said something about feeling sorry for other people , implying you 're not sorry for the french because it 's their personal fault . 
  and again , to answer your previous comment , no , i wo n't accept the blame , i wo n't shoulder my part because i had no part in it . 
  also , i do n't ask germans to take responsibility for the war , and i do n't think they should . 
  finally , you 're making it seem french politicians were all powerful and did everything related to the eu and the euro , like no one else was into it in the slightest bit and france somehow forced it on everybody else . 
  that 's simply not true , but speaking of the war , it seems you too like playing the blame game , and finding an entire people to blame as sole responsible for everything wrong . 
  when did i blame the germans ? 
  ( in addition , i was n't aware the french blamed the germans in general ) . 
  and why should i personally feel responsible ? 
  i had nothing to do with it . 
  i really do n't get how you have such a hard time understanding this . 
  maybe you want me to explain it further ? 
  yeah , each french person is responsible . 
  but do feel sorry for all the other people . 
  yes , there are guys who try to `` pick up '' girls at the bar , or on the street . 
  i usually associate this to the `` racailles '' type people ( or `` chavs '' for the brits ) , though it does happen that a `` normal '' french guy does this as well . 
  by `` american style dating '' i 'm thinking maybe of the stereotype we see in movies . 
  i mean , there 's not even a word for `` a date '' in french . 
  in my experience , when you take a girl out here , especially if you actually know her , it 's pretty much unsaid that it 's a `` date '' . 
  if it 's a girl a guy picked up at the bar , then of course , the circumstances are clear and things thus need to be said straightforward . 
  as for your example , it actually really depends on each individual relationship , but i 'd say there are chances he wants to go out with you , unless he wants a fuck buddy , 
  in france you meet someone from mutual friends , your class , your job , an activity or something . . like everywhere else . 
  if you do n't have the possibility to hook up at some party or whatever , you eventually have to resort to asking that person out . 
  it 's not really a `` date '' in the american idea of the word , as the intention tends to be unsaid , although both parties usually know what 's going on . 
  a `` date '' can be going to the movies , or more casually , getting a drink at some bar . 
  that 's the general gist of it , but ultimately , how it goes on depends on each individual personalities . 
  flirting , `` dating '' , relationships can of course vary hugely depending on whether or not the individuals are shy , outgoing , young , old , idiots , clever , rich , goths . . :p basically you can find anything . 
  i 've been told by foreigners that french girls are difficult , which may be true in comparison to some other more `` warm '' countries , like latin american countries - though if they like you enough in the first moments you meet , they wo n't be difficult at all . 
  french girls will want to be treated proper , though it does n't mean you ca n't be cheeky or include sexual innuendo during the flirting process , so long as it 's in good taste , or funny . 
  if a girl sleeps with you the first night you start going out , it does n't mean it 's not serious - there 's little of that `` you must n't sleep with the guy on the first date '' we tend to hear in american films . 
  same here , though there are a couple of historical moments which french kids might learn in more detail as well : - austrian empire as an actor in the revolutionary and napoleonic wars ( and of course , queen marie antoinette of austria ) . 
  - austrian empire in the [ second italian war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_italian_war_of_independence ) , which we learn about a little , notably because france intervened in it and got to annexe some italian territories as compensation for the trouble . 
  also , if i may add , austria is mentioned as part of the eu . 
   almost unquestionably , christmas is an entirely secular holiday in the us you 're saying this this / r/europe . 
  i mean who in western europe at least even thinks of jesus on christmas . 
  and we have no media claiming there 's a `` war on christmas '' because there 's no nativity scene on the town square . 
  france will probably get the most votes anyway , cause who thinks of countries like `` slovakia '' , `` bosnia '' or `` the netherlands '' for these things . 
  only relevant countries make it :d, 
  i also think russia is european . 
  it just expanded beyond what 's classically considered europe .
