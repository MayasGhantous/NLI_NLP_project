  most countries allow duel citizenship . 
  to obtain french citizenship for example , you need to work here for a few of years , or marry a french person . 
  comparatively speaking , i gather countries like france , belgium and the uk ( and maybe sweden ) would be easier to obtain citizenship than others . 
  yeah , i know them . 
  they 're extremely famous in the metal scene , in france at least . 
  i did not know that . 
  thx for the info , i 'll check it out . 
  they 're also pretty good in [ folk black metal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmjsdbghoru ), 
  algeria is something else . 
  france has been policing sub-saharan africa , notably the ivory coast , countless times , which was n't very different than the mali intervention . 
  then why were you talking about `` recent excursions '' ? 
  i was just saying france has been doing what it did in mali for example for the past 50 years . 
  [ french music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqwgbmuslug ) :d but this is a parody to be honest , with a gay joke ( `` i love your ass , your man 's ass '' ) . 
  france invented garlic :p, 
  you liked having [ a chunk of your future country annexed ] ( http://www.zonu.com/images/0x0/2009-12-21-11432/the-french-empire-under-napoleon-1812.svg ) , eh ? 
  france has been policing africa since decolonization , with successes and failures . 
  it 's not recent . 
   a 16 year-old from trappes allegedly got violently attacked by two men because she was wearing a muslim veil . 
  interestingly this was not covered by mainstream media and i could not find out exactly which type of veil she was wearing ( ie whether she was breaking the law or not ) the mainstream media did n't talk about it because there 's is no proof that anything she said is true , there are no witnesses , and she has `` small scratches '' on her face . 
  i highly doubt anything like that happened in trappes of all places , where if you 're one of the last remaining white guys you better hide . 
  since all these `` attacks '' happen without whitnesses , in muslim ghettos , i feel the media is starting to stop reporting on these instances because they 're basically just some woman claiming stuff . 
  what ? 
  is n't there also a tiny community of greeks in southern italy , who date back from way way back ? 
  ( like , from roman times ? ), 
  wtf ? 
  in france , the `` 100 % french '' is for beef and cheese :p but then there are regional labels . 
  like `` product of brittany '' . 
  those labels do help the sales a lot . 
  two of those three you mentioned are in english and the average guy probably thinks they 're american films . 
  a film like am\u00e9lie however , was huge publicity for paris though . 
  it still makes him `` bad '' and an `` ass '' , regardless of your effort to be such a good boy . 
  i 'm giving my honest , very assured opinion that this is bullshit . 
  take it or leave it . 
  tell me when you get actual confirmation that her words , her testimony which is for now confirmed by no one but herself , is true , and they find some non-existing white gang in that town . 
  i 'd be surprised if whites in that town constitute more than 10 % of the population ( i 've been there ) . 
  of all the other recent `` claims '' of islamic women being attacked by `` skinheads '' ( who practically do n't exist in france anymore and are mostly a fantasy ) , none of these claims have been resolved . 
  why ? 
  because these people claim to be attacked in their muslim ghetto by skinheads . 
  but there are n't any skinheads in their ghettos . 
  it would be insane for anyone to be a skinhead or white racist gang in these ghettos . 
  just tell me when you find confirmation that culprits have been found here . 
  then i 'll deliver an apology . 
  yeah , it 's the same as `` suspended sentence '' . 
  anyway , i agree that jail is n't always the solution . 
  however `` suspended sentences '' seem to lead to a lot of multi-recidivists ( is this correct english ? ) . 
  basically small time delinquents feel they have immunity , because each time they get caught they 're left off with a suspended sentence . 
  they have no incentive to stop their ways , to stop mugging people and all , because they 'll just spend a night in jail , and go to court which gives them some suspended sentence , maybe at best they get a fine . 
  i 'm okay with suspended sentences for non-violent crimes , but there are actual muggers who get suspended sentences here , and a mugging could easily cause serious injury if not death . 
  they 're just lucky they did n't kill anybody during a mugging . 
  it 's pure chance that their mugging `` went well '' . 
  if it turned dirty and someone got killed they 'd get a real prison sentence . 
  it seems to me the justice system does n't take that into account enough . 
  no harm . 
  i 'd have agreed with you yesterday . 
  but apparently the numbers for this semester are rather encouraging . 
  bob denard : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bob_denard one of the most baddass men in modern history . 
  just today , the new results have come out . 
  french growth rate this semester at 0,5 % ( the news talk about the end of the recession ) . 
  german at 0,7 % . 
  portugal at 1,1 % . 
  the bad students are greece , italy , and ... the netherlands , who have a negative growth rate . 
  even if france was in the negative , it still gives more to the eu than it gets back . 
  so ... yeah ... edit : source in french , but there 's a map : http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2013/08/15/20002-20130815artfig00070-zone-euro-quels-sont-les-pays-qui-renouent-avec-la-croissance.php, 
  seriously , it 's total utter bulshit !, 
  that was her report . 
  there are no witnesses or whatever . 
  i 'm willing to bet my right hand that she 's a liar . 
  `` small scratches on her face '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  as soon as i read she was in the town of trappes , one of the most islamized towns in france , i knew this was bullshit . 
  the town had a recent incident with police arresting a fully veiled woman , which caused a riot . 
  and since then , muslims have bizarrely suddenly been reporting how oppressed they are , being `` attacked '' by some `` whites '' or `` skinheads '' in totally islamic suburbs where the few remaining whites are mostly elderly people hidden in their houses like they were bunkers . 
  there 's no way this happened in trappes . 
  any kind of skinhead or white gang in that shithole town would have been killed off long ago . 
  this woman did n't even try . 
  `` scratches on her face '' . 
  there was a jewish woman a couple years back who faked an attack from non existing skinheads and was covered extensively by the news until the story was proven false , well at least she took the time to carve a swastika on her stomach . 
  now that 's devotion !, 
  `` scratches on her face . . '' , now that 's amateur . 
  to any americans , do n't look up the leniency of the french justice system , you 'll be happy about your prison rate . 
  seriously though , france is too lenient . 
  there 's not enough room in prisons for everyone that deserves to get time , so many petty criminals ( who participate in the state of insecurity more than big criminals ) just get `` symbolic '' time which they never serve . 
  even for violent crimes like mugging . 
  we call that `` sursis '' . 
  i do n't know the word in english . 
  basically a judge says `` you 're sentenced to 6 months in sursis '' , which means you 're sentenced to 6 months in jail but you do n't go to jail . 
  except for your flag with a huge cross on it :p i had no idea there were references to norse mythology , and that 's baddass . 
  i 'll check it out . 
  edit : oh , i forgot : religion neutral since 1789 !, 
   ( ok , with a minor hiatus in between ) . 
  i remember there was a whole public discussion a few years back about changing the french anthem because it was deemed too violent , but especially too `` racist '' for stupid-ass pc personalities . 
  they figured it was racist because the chorus basically says `` too arms citizens , raise the battalions , let 's march , let 's march , so that an ** impure blood ** waters our furrows '' . 
  what these guys hilariously misunderstand is sarcasm . 
  the `` impure blood '' referred to in the anthem is that of the revolutionaries themselves ( the anthem dates back to the french revolution of course ) , as opposed to the nobles , who have `` pure blood '' . 
  nothing racist here , move along . 
  in france we hear the anthem all the time , but the huge majority does n't know `` most of the lyrics '' because it 's very long . 
  we only know the first verse . 
  ( which is kind of too bad , because the rest of the lyrics are just as baddass as the first verse everyone knows , like `` if our heroes fall , the soil will produce new ones , all ready to fight '' ) . 
  yeah , i remember that time too . 
  at least back then we were never late , and we had a set rendez-vous place .
