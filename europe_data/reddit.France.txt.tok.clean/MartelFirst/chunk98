  ultimately i 'm not surprised oysters and such are n't found everywhere in france . 
  france is such an extremely diverse country , even considering its apparent unity , `` one and indivisible '' . 
  anyway , it 's pretty impressive that `` b\u00fbches de no\u00ebl '' can be found in china , considering they 're probably rare in the rest of europe . 
  but all in all , i 'm surprised that they mostly only exist in france . 
  i mean these cakes are perfectly designed for christmas . 
  i 'm shocked that this consumerist trend did n't catch on everywhere . 
  cause you ca n't have christmas in france without some ridiculous cake shaped like a log . . 
  ok . maybe oysters are a northern thing . 
  fondue is also glorious . 
  i 'm from paris , but paris gets all its fresh oysters , and any other sea-food , from normandy and all , and this since the middle ages . 
  when december comes , i see oyster stands all around my neighborhood . 
  where are you from ? 
  to me , oysters seem pretty much normal for both christmas and new years . 
  raclette is the best invention humanity has ever come up with . 
  france : there ai n't no real christmas without ** oysters ** . 
  if there 's one obligatory dish in france for christmas it 's oysters . 
  also ** foie gras ** obviously . 
  problem is that those dishes tend to be expensive . 
  the main dish can be any kind of roasted meat really ... mostly lamb i guess , rather than bird or cow . 
  the desert is generally a [ `` b\u00fbche de no\u00ebl '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%bbche_de_no%c3%abl ) , ie , a cake in the shape of a yule log . 
  i 'm wondering if this exists anywhere else than in the francophone world ? 
  do any other people have this ? 
  cause it 's the obvious mainstream christmas desert in france . . 
  a rising purchasing power tends to be good for the economy . 
  ford famously understood that if they payed their factory workers more , they in turn could buy ford cars . 
  however it is true that some companies either ca n't afford to pay their workers more , or would rather not . 
  otherwise , i do think it is a good thing , though obviously it needs to be progressive , and in par with the country 's rising economy . 
  in most countries , the minimum wage is raised every few years or so , calculated accordingly to inflation and whatnot . 
  anyway , 385 dollars a month is insanely low . 
  i have difficulties imagining that there are still european countries with wages that low . 
  yeah , sure . 
  i also say merry christmas to christians . 
  it 's only normal . 
  i 'm just surprised the president of the european council did n't say `` happy holidays '' since i tend to view the eu as pretty pc , so when speaking to all europeans - whom many are n't christians - i would expect he 'd want to include everyone . 
  he said `` merry christmas '' at the end of the video and not `` happy holidays '' . 
  i must admit i 'm pretty surprised . 
  just reminds me of the `` war on christmas '' debate in the us . 
  if kosovo gets to be first autonomous and then independent it 's only normal that they understand that sort of demand and be the `` bigger man '' and give autonomy to the serb northern region ( though i wish they 'd ultimately give back the majority-serb northern region to serbia ) . 
  hehe , i can just imagine the guy making this video , on the spur of the moment , thinking it was a brilliant idea . 
  yeah . 
  some french can be pigheaded ... 
  some belgians too , and some germans , some british , some americans , some canadians , some swedes ... 
  sure , you may be right on that . 
  however , we have seen countries much less important on the economic and political level , single-handedly block the accession of countries to the eu , like bulgaria i believe . 
  however , i do believe french politicians would be more diplomatic and not stop turkey 's accession if all other eu countries are for it . 
  i can tell you that the armenian genocide denial is a central obstacle for its eu bid - but maybe it 's just for france , but to get in the eu , one needs all member states ' votes . 
  there was a little tension between france and turkey a few years back when france decided to make illegal the denial of the armenian genocide , like it does for the holocaust deniers . 
  there are a lot of armenian immigrants in france , hence politicians and the public speak of this regularly . 
  but of course the cyprus problem is the most important . 
  that 's what i was referring to , and the armenian genocide denial and the kurdish problems . 
  so long as turkey does n't align with eu standards on human rights and international law , they hopefully ca n't get in . 
  it may only work when turkey aligns to eu standards . 
  france here . 
  maybe both of us should ease him down and let him just have austria and czechia or something . 
  compared to the vast majority of other countries , no we 're not . 
  we 're among the least racist , the least patriotic . 
  have you ever gone to other countries outside western europe ? 
  a lot of people believe jews control the world . 
  i do n't care what idiots believe . 
  there are facts , and the socialist party to which mr. valls here belongs to , has publicly admitted when asked on the radio or tv , that the fn is obviously not a fascist party . 
  everyone 's a `` fascist '' to some idiot leftists . 
  president sarkozy was called a fascist himself . 
  that 's how ridiculous this all gets . 
  i 'm not trying to defend the fn , but it 's simply unproductive and idiotic to call their political stance `` fascist '' . 
  nationalist ? 
  or even xenophobic ? 
  sure . 
  fascist ? 
  of course not . 
  that was my point . 
  hundred years ' war finds its early origins in the norman conquest of britain , because after that , the anglo ( - norman ) king thus had possessions in france . . 
  indeed , that 's what allies do . 
  france and germany have been extremely close as well . 
  but france and the uk are still independently powerful military forces on their own . 
  both pretty much equally fourth and fifth worldwide in terms of military budgets , with very different fields of operation . 
  take the war in iraq for example where both countries ' politics were clearly opposed . 
  both countries have very different interests militarily speaking , france being much more present in africa for example . 
  but then again , that 's not so much of a bad thing . 
  it 's almost complementary , and a union would make `` franglend '' present all around the world . 
  i think it has chances to work well if the british were more open about it . 
  i do n't think the french would mind so much . 
  i mean we already worked together on the eurostar , esa , concorde , and not to mention the millions of french and british living in eachother 's countries . 
  london is something like the 4rth largest `` french '' city , and normandy is practically the official region for british retirees . 
  yeah , i have a degree but it 's not in languages so it would n't work - it 's not like there are n't enough people with useless literary degrees in france  . 
  my father had the opportunity to work in a summer-university there , for a very good salary , because he was already a french teacher in france , and a fairly recognized author/poet here . 
  i have a great memory of seeing jurassic park when it came out in the theaters there . 
  i was 8 or so . 
  good times . 
  i ( op ) seem to be the only frenchman in this thread ( and now you ) , so it 's not surprising really ... 
  otherwise i 'd gladly annex wallonia :d , but in the context of my scenario , joining with another big economic leader ( germany , or uk ) seemed like a better choice , compared to just adding belgium which would just turn out to be one of many other provinces . 
  i 'm french . 
  when i was a kid i 'd go to vermont during summers because my dad got this massively well-payed summer job as a french teacher there . 
  it 's such a cute , peaceful state . 
  if i had a bunch of money and did n't need to work , or if i could find a decent job in vermont , i 'd probably live there . 
  thanks . 
  yeah . 
  as a french guy i heard about some talks of french savoy joining switzerland . 
  it is true that these `` savoyards '' are pretty close to the swiss in nature , and their region looks very swiss . 
  but obviously i 'm opposed to it . 
  we got it helping the italians fight the austrians .
