  exports would then be increased by a single currency . 
   customs would do the same thing what customs ? 
   10 % depreciation implies all assets loose 10 % of their value , you become funtionally poorer by 10 % , compared to the rest of the world , any investor looses 1/10th of his money . 
  you loose tens of thosand of euros on your property value . 
  exactly . 
  it means french products are 10 % cheaper . 
  thus increasing our competitivity and our tourism ( do i need to explain the importance of tourism in france ? ) . 
  it means french projects become 10 % cheaper , increasing foreign attractivity . 
  overall , depreciation will increase the activity and create jobs . 
  that 's exactly what we need . 
   and no ,10 % depreciation is not 2 % inflation , maybe per quarter , cumulated with the natural inflation . 
  yes it is . 
  uk had a 25 % depreciation . 
  now look at its [ inflation ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi ) . 
   cost of echange is quite high actually , think of this , to prevent a + -2 cost over a 30 day period most traders pay between 0.2 and .5 % exchange rate insurance . 
  i 'd need a source and example for this . 
  again , look at switzerland , uk or norway . 
   jobs for what ? 
  can you produce a iphone ? 
  no , you produce expensive cheese . 
  lol . 
  we 're the [ 6th exportator in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports ) we produce a lot more than cheese  http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/fra/all/show/2012/  can a french man pick up the drop in demand that consumers of expensive cheese dropped . 
  you 're wages are to high for internal production to pick up the slack of imports and to low to absorb the excess production of your goods . 
  i 'm not talking of producing iphones . 
  i 'm just saying something that has been proven : french economy is more price sensitive that german 's economy . 
  which means a 10 % depreciation would increase activity a lot . 
   you can asses your structural issues within the eu ( and with the whole of the eu as market ) , proactively yeah , what was advised by the eu commission was to lower the wages and reduce social standards . 
  i 'd rather have a depreciation than this kind of internal deflation . 
   i know countries are different , but isolating yourself does not promote growt it 's not isolation . 
  is switzerland isolated ? 
  is south korea isolated ? 
  it 's simply having a monetary policy that 's compatible with our economy . 
  not having to change our structure to please eu commission . 
   inflation and isolationism just kicks the can into the future , and you avoid adressing the fact that you are n't competitive and you protect yourself from becoming so . 
  it does increase price competitivity . 
  increasing cost competitivity is not sufficient to get our economy in a better state . 
  it 's just a different model . 
  we ca n't all be germany or luxembourg . 
   the common currentcy increased velocity ( a side effect of a increase in transactions ) and that increased inflation diffirences . 
  again , it 's not the euro . 
  how is it not the euro ? 
   tell me one . 
  again : http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/fra/all/show/2012/  that is a tower , not a piramid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_pyramid  you need restructuring not more jobs . 
  you need to slowly cut out ineficient jobs and replace them with more productive jobs . 
  so does everyone . 
   but despite this we are growing , slow and steady and as us easterners catch up , the eu will run increasingly well . 
  we are not growing . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/gdp-growth http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/64217ffa-2946-11e4-baec-00144feabdc0.html  i think political systems are trans national . 
  i think having a common currency among structurally different coutries is more out there than having a single political system span across cultures . 
  could you please elaborate on this one ? 
  i do n't really get what you mean . 
   if there would by a separate electoral system we would develop a european identity and a sense of solidarity . 
  yes goverment interest would still b a source for pety conflict but we would at least be unified against the outsiders which outsiders ? 
  that 's a main problem . 
  all countries in the eu have different allies . 
  just look at the mess with ukraine . 
  just look at the mess with the war in irak . 
  that 's just not feasible imo . 
   no , it means criminals can come and commit crimes , for honest people there are limitations like real estate costs , language barriers and qualifications . 
  it 's like arguing parisians come and steal all the jobs in ajacion . 
  some do , but it 's far from systemic . 
  of course there are barriers and limitations . 
  still if you do n't respect the freedom of movement there are sanctions . 
  just look at what happens with switzerland 's immigration quotas . 
   then have one , a young woman will kindly disagree and keep her uterus to herself my point was to say that 's it 's not a question of `` better '' . 
  and i know many women that would happily have babies and take care of them instead of having to work shitty jobs . 
   again , what , how ? 
  we compete on products ( for example agriculture between germany and france ) , we compete on fiscality ( ireland ) , we compete on geopolitical issues ( ukraine ) . 
   what would politicians argue about if taxes where fixed ? 
  what taxes and fixed by who ? 
   standards have gone up across the board it 's the opposite . 
  in germany , 1 euro jobs . 
  i 'm not even talking about spain or greece . 
   there is n't a labor auction of course there is . 
  look at spain . 
  wages are decreasing . 
  i 've got a source in french if you want . 
   you could argue that there was and still is in outsourceable industries but most industries are immobile . 
  also most industries that can aford to relocate do so only when there is a massive economy of scale to profit out off . 
  relocating to malaysia not romania . 
  nope . 
  half of relocating from france is done to eu countries . 
   so you think your currently have a worse trade balance than you had previously ? 
  i do n't `` think '' . 
  it 's a fact . 
   also the first study claims 10 % inflation is good for reducing unemployment rate 2 % and gaining less than 1 percent in gdp 10 % depreciation , not inflation . 
  and 1 % in gdp is a lot ( we have 0 right now . 
  ) , there 's also about 100 000 jobs at stake which means a lot less deficit . 
   such a high inflation has a massive effect on income , deposits and credit that it would make you a health risk for all foreign credit . 
  how massive ? 
  that 's all the question . 
  evaluate this please , take into account the decrease in real debt rates . 
  and again a 10 % depreciation increases inflation by 2 % . 
  not so massive . 
   the relative benefit from trade which you would get would be limited compared to the bonus you currently get from not paying any customs or having to work around exchange rates . 
  evaluate this . 
  which exchange rates ? 
  which customs ? 
  cost of exchange rates is marginal and you 'd have to explicit which customs you think we 'd have to pay . 
  south korea has been using customs for decades and that has not prevented it from constantly growing .
