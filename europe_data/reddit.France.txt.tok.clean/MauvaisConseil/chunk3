  i think you 're just talking to scare people with no real study behind this . 
   but unless you close of the borders and become self sustainable internally you do not want inflation and cheap exports , china and even the us will outsell us easaly . 
  nope . 
  we need jobs and cheaper exports . 
  french economy just needs a 3-4 % inflation rate . 
  it 's its structural inflation . 
  you really think all eu countries behave the same do you ? 
  just look at the different partial inflation rates between different euro countries . 
  the common currency increased the differences between countries because we do n't have the same economical structures . 
   we compete with japan , not india , and it 's not a pride thing , it 's just common sense , we can not affort their labor costs . 
  it 's not black or white ... we compete with them on some sectors and products . 
  that 's what was proven in the studies i gave you and why french economy is price sensitive . 
   the uk is fucked , qe basically signed them up for at least 20 years of constant inflationary pressure they can not get rid of . 
  norway literally has the money to print money and not feel a sting . 
  `` the uk is fucked '' ... 
  i 'm not even going to discuss this with you . 
  switzerland intervene specifically because of exchange rates for trade issues . 
   why ? 
  because of economic structures . 
  demographics , job market , level of education , housing , industrial specialization etc. 
  we have a relatively young and growing population so we need a lot more investments than for example germany . 
  just look at these age pyramids : [ france ] ( http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/__travail/graphique_legends/img.php?id=61706 ) vs [ germany ] ( http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/__travail/graphique_legends/img.php?id=61707 ) . 
  germany has an old population looking to secure its money . 
  we have a very different situation . 
   economic stagnation is a consequence of lack of vision and developement . 
  european leaders have a long tradition of that . 
  the eu is just a easy target for national politicians to point at . 
  the eu is a consequence of a lack of vision made by european leaders . 
   please explain why does deflation bother you ? 
  http://snbchf.com/economic-theory/deflationary-spiral/  the political issues of the eu are not for me to argue against , we both want to dismantle the epp and create a real democracy at the european level not a luxembourgian plutocracy powered by national politicians greed . 
  agreed . 
  i just do n't think it 's feasible because there 's not such thing as a european people . 
   all of europe has a tradition of submiting to us interests no . 
  france does not . 
   i would argue that as a united front we stand a better chance of saying no , than as individual members . 
  the fact is that we are not united . 
  i do n't think that we 'll ever be . 
  so we are divided , and weaker than if we were able to make our own decisions independently . 
   again imigration is a national issue that is just passed onto the eu . 
  nope , freedom of movement means immigrants in any eu country can come into another . 
   your fight is with local liberals . 
  it 's also with local liberals , but not only with them . 
   blame feminism for demographic stagnation , women happen to have better things to do than have babies in modern societies . 
  there 's no `` better '' thing than to have a baby . 
  it 's a complex issue so i wo n't spend more time on it here . 
   that is just plain stupid , they get money from taxes and are propped up by local goverments that are payed for by taxes . 
  they want your taxes , a lot of them . 
  freedom of movement and different tax legislations allow this . 
  it 's again a proof that we are not united but divided . 
  we are not allies but competitors . 
  the stupid ting was creating a union with no fiscal harmonization . 
  the stupid thing is the eu . 
   i do n't understand that one , how is there a increase in competition and why on earth would that be bad ? 
  it 's [ social dumping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_dumping ) means competition on labour laws . 
  the perfect example is the issue of posted worker . 
  do i really need to explain why it 's bad ? 
   you are the second biggest economy due to servicing a european market nope , we were before the eu existed and would be even if the eu did not . 
  we 're the second most populated nation and have a history of being in the top eu countries . 
  now if you can prove your point with any study i 'd be glad to look at it , but you 're just repeating the same thing over and over and i 'm not convinced at all . 
  we used to perform a lot better before the eu . 
  our balance of trade was positive and our competitiveness was much higher than it is now , because we controlled our monetary policy . 
  in fact our economy is negatively affected by the common currency : http://dea.uib.es/digitalassets/235/235067_w60.pdf http://www.ofce.sciences-po.fr/blog/weaker-euro-likely-mean-french-economy/ anyway , countries in the euro do n't have the [ same structural inflation rates ] ( http://www.fmsh.fr/en/c/1397 ) so it can not work at all without huge fiscal transfers from germany , to high inflation countries . 
   which is only partial because if you want and foreign commerce or investment you ca n't do whatever you want with your currency anyway still it 's better than what we have with the euro . 
  switzerland , norway and the uk do much better thanks to their control . 
   and some increased stability due to the german fobia of inflation as a consequence you have a much more stable currency than you had previously [ we still have a higher partial inflation than germany ] ( http://www.insee.fr/en/indicateurs/analys_conj/archives/march2013_d2.pdf ) , which is hurting us a lot . 
  a 3 % or 4 % inflation rate is good for our economies . 
  a 2 % inflation rate is simply not adapted to our economic structure . 
   you really think you do n't benefit from the being in the eu ? 
  why i hate the european union ? 
  well : * economic stagnation * deflation * unemployment * undemocratic institutions * no respect for the 2005 referendum * no control on immigration * submission to us interests ( ttip etc. ), 
  * demographic stagnation * encouragement of tax fraud and tax evasion * encouragement of fiscal and social competition * lowering of social conditions yes , i think that overall we do n't benefit from being in the eu . 
   and you went down the paranoia train yeah , coming from someone who said `` france would be nothing without eu contracts and agriculture subsidies '' , when in fact we are the 2nd biggest eu net contributor and our economy is deeply penalised by the euro ...  we are so envious of you that we bribe european officials to take ally our money and make you poor like us just read again what you wrote : * that provision is meant to equalise the economic balance , so that our guys can buy more or your crap . 
  * you need the eu and get huge benefits from it , we do n't . 
   that provision is meant to equalise the economic balance , so that our guys can buy more or your crap . 
  or so that our guys are as poor and cheap as yours . 
  well i think i 'm more informed than you . 
  i 've refuted your main points with sources when all you could provide were subjective statements or unsourced affirmations , for example the `` cap specifically benefits france '' when it clearly does not . 
  i did my homework . 
  do yours . 
   you mean a disappointingly large number of people believed the line `` nah we can just unilaterally change the treaty and still get all the good it brings us , the eu wo n't mind '' . 
  so what do you call `` level-headed '' ? 
  agreeing with you ? 
  obeying the politicians ? 
  i believe citizens are equal , so each vote counts the same . 
  i 'm not allowed to do anything but respect the will of the people . 
  moreover in 1992 the swiss rejected eea membership by referendum . 
  once again the politicians had decided against the will of the people and against sovereignty . 
   direct democracy is n't some magic bullet against the people being mislead by dishonest politicians no it 's not and i never said so . 
  but i think that 's its better than having a minority of self-proclaimed experts choosing for the others . 
  once again we can interpret differently the last referendum on immigration quotas : in 2000 and 2005 , the swiss were mislead by their politicians who explained that being in the schengen area and agreeing to the free movement of people would be positive . 
  after a few years of application of these treaties , they realized that what they had been told was wrong so they decided to change the immigration conditions . 
   what 's contentious , here , that switzerland is part of efta or that the eu is utterly dominating it ? 
  i 'd like explanations on both if possible . 
  i 'm just asking for a source or example on the `` gazillions of laws to stay in efta '' . 
   it 's generally not so much `` change position '' but `` influence the first position there is '' . 
  how so ? 
   have you ever had a look at , how , say , cap is organised and how much it specifically benefits france ? 
  well i 'd like more proof on this as i 'm not convinced . 
  some countries in the eu have larger agricultural sectors than others , notably france and spain , and consequently receive more money under the cap . 
  but france is a net contributor in the eu ( [ by more than 8 billion euros ] ( http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/spsv/all/79/ ) in 2012 ) .
