  moreover , regarding the cap , ** france represents [ 17.9 % of total eu-28 agricultural output ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/statistics/factsheets/pdf/fr_en.pdf ) , and gets [ 9.88 billion euros out of the 58.982 billion euros ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/statistics/factsheets/pdf/eu_en.pdf ) budget , that is to say 16.75 % of cap budget ** . 
  so no i would n't say that cap is organised to specifically benefit france . 
   doing something in the eu without france is n't easy , at all . 
  like what ? 
   it 's why smaller countries are so often pissed at germany and france working together so often , both together only need to convince half a handful of smaller countries to do stuff . 
  this is what abandoning sovereignty is : being pissed off when other countries decide for you . 
   that 's the council , though . 
  the parliament works way less along national lines , which is good good is a subjective statement so i would n't argue with you on this . 
  i have a different opinion . 
   more like 2.4 % , about as much as austria . 
  representation is n't proportional , smaller countries get more seats . 
  i find this very undemocratic . 
  is 2.4 % of votes more than what they can get with bilateral treaties ? 
   they 'd also be on the council with quite some veto rights in quite some areas . 
  could you be more specific please ? 
  i find eu institutions complicated and was unable to find more information on this , where would they have veto rights ? 
   in total , yes . 
  but if they want to , in any form , be part of the economic area , free movement and other things europe offers , then they have less say if they are n't in the eu . 
  it makes sense . 
   all they can do right now is say `` well we 'll go alone , or we 'll accept the eu 's conditions '' . 
  they do n't have much influence over those conditions , it 's accept or forget about it . 
  well i 'm not sure of this . 
  if immigration is so important for the eu ( free movement ) and for swiss ( limitation ) and that they disagree on this and ca n't find an agreement , then maybe the eu is incompatible with what swiss people want . 
   that is , in a nutshell : if they want to be completely out of everything , yes , they should n't be in the eu ( duh ) . 
  if they want to be in , they would benefit much from being actually in , and not in some limbo state as they 're now . 
  so basically it 's all or nothing ? 
  i understand your point of view , but i respectfully disagree . 
  i call this switching from one domination to another , not sovereignty . 
  we can agree to disagree . 
   level-headed well that 's a subjective word i ca n't rely on . 
  the last referendum on immigration quotas just proved the opposite : the swiss do not want another country to rule for them . 
   they have to implement gazillions of laws to stay in efta for example ? 
  do you have more details on this ? 
   but do n't get a say on those laws exactly because they are n't eu members well as a french i really do n't think that french people have a word to say on these agreements . 
  remember that we voted against the 2005 constitution project , but that was ruled over by the lisbon treaty in 2009 . 
  can you name one project where france made the eu change its position ? 
  if switzerland were in the eu , it would have about 1.6 % of the votes ( 8 million people / 500 million in eu ) . 
  outside of the eu , they are able to reject agreements like they did recently on immigration . 
  i think that they have more power of decision outside of the eu than they would if they were inside . 
  the lack of sovereignty is the reason why people would want to leave the eu . 
  therefore i insist that it 's not an argument . 
  it 's just about leaving one sphere of influence for another . 
  of course . 
  it 's better . 
  i 'm just saying that the sovereignty is not really an argument when speaking of the eu . 
  one word : ** sovereignty ** . 
  fuck off eu  it 's really just passing from one dominant power to another , but not really about sovereignty ... 
   they claim they 're against officials holding multiple mandates ... 
  but when they won two seats in the senate , their officials both held two mandates this again ? 
  they voted the law and are going to apply it . 
  remember that the fn had 25 % of votes in the last european elections , 18.5 % in the last presidential elections , but only 2 mp or of 577 and 2 senators out of 348 . 
  but apparently it 's still too much for you . 
  and you never hear the same comments on fran\u00e7ois hollande , although [ he did exactly the same thing ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2014/01/19/01002-20140119artfig00177-cumul-des-mandats-hollande-impose-la-reforme-a-sa-gauche.php ) . 
  as always , people tend to be more severe with the weak than with the strong , but that 's just hypocritical . 
   no , it is accepted by almost every economist . 
  but that 's not the point since it would be ad-hominem all over again so , let 's move on . 
   i 'm not talking about austerity , i 'm talking about harmonization of fiscal policies . 
  those policies could be austere or they could be expansive . 
  i agree with you , there are alternatives to austerity . 
  ok , i misunderstood what you meant by `` harmonization of fiscal policies '' , thought you meant austerity . 
   spain , grece and portugal are in an unconfortable position , but slowly getting out of it . 
  others like france are running away from austerity while still being in a monetary union ( currently a conservative one ) and thus suffer from stagnation . 
  i 'm sorry but i really do n't see how spain , greece and portugal are getting better . 
  [ greece 's economy shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first three months of 2014 , and by 0.3 per cent during the second quarter ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-07/greece-set-for-return-to-economic-growth/5725198 ) . 
  they lost [ 10 years of growth ] ( http://philippewaechter.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/greece-2013-q2-gdplevel.jpg ) . 
  umemployment still at [ 27 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate ) despite [ tens of thousand of greek emigrating ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde230&amp;plugin=1 ) . 
  spain sees a little 0,6 % growth ... fuelled by [ 5.5 % of public budget deficit ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/30/spain-deficit-iduss8n0py01n20140930 ) . 
  unemployment at 24 % and [ 547,980 people left the country in 2013 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/01/spain-economic-recovery-rise-in-emigration ) . 
  portugal has [ 4.8 % of public deficit ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-30/portugal-s-budget-deficit-will-narrow-to-4-dot-8-percent-in-2014-ine-says ) for 0.3 % of growth . 
  i seriously see why my position convinces many . 
  we simply do n't believe that the eumarny will change its austerity policy , ( remember what juncker said ? ), 
  so we 'd rather get out . 
   there is no middle solution here , either you are in a union or you are not . 
  if you are , you need to harmonise your policies to the rest of the union or you 'll experience imbalances . 
  the middle solution would be to increase transfers within the eurozone to reach the equivalent of what is done in the us ( 2 % of gdp ) . 
   the problem is , getting out of the union is no easy task right now . 
  some think that it 's easier than suiciding ourselves into austerity . 
   who is going to finance a country that is n't backed by the rest of the union ? 
  well i do n't know about the other countries , but french households have more than 4000 billion euros in financial savings . 
  they always paid for our debts . 
  we paid the equivalent of 24 % of gdp for reparations to germany after 1871 's war in 2 and a half years . 
  we paid 67 billions of francs in 1918 ( 18 months of 1913 's gdp ) . 
  we paid again in 1944 for wwii , in 1952 for indochina , in 1958 for algeria , in 1973 for the first oil crisis , and again in 1977 , in 1993 etc. 
   what 's wrong with improving what we currently have ? 
  well when you see an improvement , we see exactly the opposite . 
   why must we rebuild borders and do our own thing insted of cooperating and being a true competitor in the world ? 
  it depends what you mean by `` cooperating '' . 
  if it means that germany has to transfer 2 % of it gdp to southern countries , i 'm ok . 
  but i think it will never happen . 
   nationalism is nonsense , europe should be a federation each people should be free to decide . 
  federalism is nonsense . 
  you ca n't force a country to shoot itself in the foot . 
  just asking you to be more precise and giving you the program ( that you obviously did not read ) ... well that 's a polite way to recognise the conversation is not going as you want . 
  congrats , you stopped the insults < 3, 
   not only this does n't answer my question poor you . 
  maybe you should read your own question again then . 
   because you think that 's the only reason why france is in shit right now ? 
  nope , never said so . 
  just said that it costs a lot and that it 's not in the interest of france to accept that many poor and uneducated people . 
   she bans immigration from africa and eastern europe .
