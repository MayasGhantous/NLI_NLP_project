  the measures taken are simply to require a higher level of education and income before accepting new immigrants . 
   what do we do after to save our economy ? 
  get out of the eurozone . 
  do you even understand what you read in this thread ? 
  immigration costs 0,5 % of gdp growth , euro costs at least 1 % . 
  other measures are detailed [ here ] ( http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/ ) . 
   our society ? 
  how do we deal with what we already have ? 
  what is your vision of the future ? 
  do you really think getting rid of the europe will bring us somewhere ? 
  be more specific . 
   if you ca n't answer those questions , than why should i support fn ? 
  lol . 
  with that reasoning you must be an abstentionist ... look at what the other parties propose and compare . 
   are you that bored for fuck sake ? 
  i like to play . 
  i 'm enjoying this very much . 
  do n't you ? 
   you are always on the defensive , but how about the expose me all the reasons why you stand for the fn and why they should be the future of france ? 
  how about you read my previous comments to begin with ? 
  here for you : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fq80f/eurosceptics_of_reurope_what_is_your_stance_on/ckbwjqn https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fqvdd/farright_at_gates_of_power_in_france_says_pm_valls/ckc5cw9, 
  go on then . 
  why did [ you come in the first place ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2i0m3i/france_produces_no_austerity_budget_defying_eu/ckyc7c9 ) ? 
  maybe you want to show that fn 's opponents do n't have anything else to offer than insults and lies ? 
  i 'm glad to participate then , 
   lies , lies , lies , lies . 
  that 's the only word in your mouth right ? 
  well that 's the only thing that gets out of yours . 
   fn holds the absolute truth and the rest are lies right ? 
  nope , never said that . 
  just that what you say about the fn are lies and insults . 
   and it 's funny , you do n't say `` you 're wrong , here , let me explain you why '' , all you say is `` lol you lie , heres a shit link with a sentence that supposedly proves it '' . 
  the first time i corrected you . 
  you answered with insults . 
  do you remember ? 
  [ it was just yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hytdp/the_far_right_wins_again_as_france_elects_its/ckxfvgw ) . 
  since you keep on having the same attitude after i already gave you the sources , it 's not ignorance , it 's a lie . 
   what a constructive stance !, 
  i applaud you . 
  at this point i really do n't care what you say about fn , all i see is an asshole . 
  but you love arguing do n't you ? 
  is that an addiction . 
  oh , i know you love ad hominem argument , and i have all you need . 
  you wo n't resist answering right ? 
  keep on making a fool of yourself . 
   i meant it 's not just `` my '' opinion , it is widely accepted . 
  by who ? 
  those who predicted that the euro will bring prosperity and millions of jobs ? 
  french people were never asked about having to be forced to adopt austerity when voting the 1992 maastricht treaty . 
  i do n't believe in this `` there is no alternative to austerity '' position . 
  austerity brings nothing . 
   different countries need different monetary policies if the have different fiscal policies , yeah . 
  agreed on that . 
   either we unify fiscal policies or we abandon the eurozone project with catastrophic consequences for all the catastrophic consequences of your position can be seen today in greece , spain and portugal . 
  fiscal integration does n't bring back competitiveness , it widens the gap between rich and poor countries , increases unemployment and debt . 
  with no income and no growth , debt will not reduce itself . 
   the eu is attempting to unify fiscal policies no it 's not . 
  the ep agreed to lower the budget ( and therefore the transfers ) for 2014-2020 , not increase it . 
  germany did not agree to pay more for the other countries . 
  as i 've said before , i do n't see this happening in the future . 
   in my opinion the only sensible choice is further integration . 
  everything else is irrational nationalism . 
  in my opinion the only sensible choice is disintegration . 
  everything is just irrational idealism , 
   give up , seriously . 
  give up what ? 
  give up giving my opinion and correcting when people say lies ? 
   or is this your job to do this ? 
  would n't surprise me if the fn has guys like you trying to convert more idiots . 
  more insults and false claims ... 
   as usual , you play on words , and negate everything . 
  as usual , you ca n't face the truth so you have to invent some positions that do not exist . 
  i do n't play on words , i give facts when you keep making the [ strawman 's fallacy ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman ) all the time . 
   see why people hate `` debating '' with people like you ? 
  people do n't like being wrong , i understand that . 
  but maybe if you began by making sourced statements instead of insulting & inventing/lying about the fn , we could have a debate . 
   you consider everyone like an enemy , and an adversary . 
  i consider people who insult me as opponents . 
  do n't insult , do n't lie . 
   i 'm not a politician , i have nothing to prove to you it 's more like you ca n't prove anything . 
   you 're also not going to have any effect holding such pointless arguments in / r/europe https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/bandwagon  you think some polish guy is going to come to france , take the french nationality and vote for le pen after reading your aggressive comments ? 
  you 're the aggressive one . 
  you 're the one that 's insulting people and misrepresenting arguments , when it 's not blatant lie . 
   yeah , it would also exclude france . 
  exactly . 
   and by the way it 's not `` my '' argument . 
  you 're right , it 's your opinion . 
   it 's the main reason the eurozone has problems . 
  why just the eurozone ? 
  the world behaves like this . 
  us and uk do the same , and it has nothing to do with monetary policies . 
   we need to get used to having the same monetary policy and earn competitiveness the good ( and hard ) way . 
  = we need to be examples and abandon growth when the rest of the world is outgrowing us by using all the means available , including monetary policies . 
  i do n't agree with this . 
  i think that different countries need different policies . 
   i do n't have the time to consider everyone individually , especially over the internet . 
  hence generalizing ...  because history clearly showed that getting rid of all immigrants it 's not a proposition of the fn ... another lie . 
  the fn 's proposition is to reduce the incoming flow of immigrants to 10 000 per year . 
  foreigners that are legally in france will stay in france . 
   enforcing patriotism no one is proposing to enforce patriotism ... you can keep saying bullshit but that does not make it true .
