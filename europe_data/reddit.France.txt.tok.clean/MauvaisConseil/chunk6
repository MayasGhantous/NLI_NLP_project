  in fact you 're criticizing something that you do n't know , just like you did in our previous conversation . 
   the most powerful country in the world right now grew up so fast because of immigration because all countries are supposed to behave the same way ... 
  remember that population in france was 28 millions in 1800 , 38 millions en 1900 , and 65,7 millions in 2014 . 
  in the us , it was 3 millions in 1800 , 75 millions in 1900 , and 314 millions in 2014 . 
  for australia it was 5200 in 1800 , 4 millions in 1900 and 22,7 millions in 2014 . 
  different policies for different countries . 
   but closing all doors just like that is n't exactly some kind of miracle solution . 
  no one pretends that it 's a miracle solution . 
  a big part of our immigration comes from maghreb , turkey and some parts of africa where people have low school results , live in closed communities with many children . 
  studies show that they have very different backgrounds when it comes to [ marrying ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cousin_marriage#current_status ) , having children and [ educating ] ( http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/63608/telechargement_fichier_fr_insee.r.f.rences.pdf ) them . 
  people from asia and oecd countries score higher in school and integrate well ( low unemployment and high mixed marriages ) this leads to very different results when it comes to [ the cost of immigration ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/imo2013.htm ) : immigrants benefit oecd countries , except germany and france , where they cost 0,52 % of gdp each year . 
   wow , what a ground breaking achievement , fran\u00e7ois hollande is so popular after all . 
  on a serious note , more and more people are going to vote for her , why ? 
  because all other options are exhausted , ump sucked , ps sucks , the rest does n't look attractive . 
  most are not going to vote for fn because they like marine . 
  you linked popularity to `` representing good '' in a ridiculous false cause fallacy . 
   hey , you know what ? 
  let 's say that he never denied the holocaust , since that pleases you so much . 
  it 's not a question of pleasing me , it 's just the truth . 
   but saying that it 's just a detail ? 
  he did not say that . 
  for the 3rd time , he said that gas chambers were a detail , not the holocaust . 
  is that too difficult for you just to read correctly ? 
  he later explained that the way people were killed was a detail in the history of wwii . 
  gas chambers or bullets , it 's still a massacre . 
   you ca n't have rational `` debates '' with people like you people like me ? 
  because obviously we are all the same ...  if fn represented everything good in the world , they would have been elected by now lol . 
  being good has never been related to the results in elections . 
  and the fn does not pretend to represent everything good in the world , they pretend to represent what 's good for french people . 
   and they would n't be seen so badly in france mlp is still more popular than fran\u00e7ois hollande ...  yet any critic towards them is `` lying '' ? 
  nope , [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hytdp/the_far_right_wins_again_as_france_elects_its/ckxo867 ) was lying though . 
  you 've been confronted but still refuse to face the facts ? 
  thank you for proving my point . 
  and i will continue to do so although i could just create another account . 
  that would n't make my comments less interesting or right . 
  try to have a debate based on rational statements instead of calling names and lying like you did the last time . 
   you mean that the demand for their products is n't very elastic ? 
  exactly . 
  german price elasticity is small . 
  especially for exports outside of the eurozone . 
  german capital goods exports tend to be high quality goods that compete more on quality than on price . 
   the burden of proof is on you if you insist , since you claimed first that it did . 
  nope , / u/slyratchet claimed that euro brought growth . 
  i already showed the different growth rates between eurozone and uk+us . 
   but i prefer to ignore it because `` what would have happened if ... '' is purely speculative and just ends up projecting our preconception on our speculations . 
  so we are supposed to take your word and never contradict the `` euro brought growth '' claim ? 
  as i said , the euro looks more and more like a religion . 
  we have to believe in it , not think about it ...  goods prices did converge , anyway nope , there 's been persistent inflation differentials and , as a result , large cumulative changes in relative prices . 
  * the divergence in spending and output growth has been paralleled by divergence in production costs and price levels . 
  unit labour costs , displayed again for the 1999-2008 period in figure 2 , were constant in germany while increasing by nearly 40 percent in spain . 
  a similar picture is obtained for the other gips countries and alternative measures of the price level . 
  * * since the european central bank has roughly kept to its inflation target of ( close to ) 2 percent for the aggregate eurozone , the gips countries have clearly overshot this target while germany 's inflation rate was accordingly lower . 
  *  if you 're not eating your vegetables i 'm not going to force-feed them to you lowering the level of debate even more ... do you realize how ridiculous you sound ? 
   what ? 
  then we should have divided france too . . france did not invade germany in 1870 , 1914 and 1940 ... 
  it was the other way around my dear . 
  ask ukraine about that . 
  so the eu deal caused a war , it did not prevent it . 
  eu did not bring peace as / u/slyratchet said ...  consult a dictionary according to adam smith , moral is doing what is good for me ...  and then he goes on forming a moral assesment of mankind in general . 
  point is that a moral understanding of humans is a necessary precondition to develop an economic system , because it defines the goals of such an economic system . 
  how far we can get is only half the problem ; which direction we should go is the other one , and that a moral choice . 
  it 's a choice , not a moral choice . 
   i proposed a new policy . 
  the fact that you just repeat your talking points clearly indicates that you 're not paying attention . 
  you proposed a policy that relies on the ecb being able to maintain a 2 % inflation ... 
  except that ecb was never able to do so , and our current quasi deflation shows it clearly . 
   why would you include italy then ? 
  i said maybe . 
  i do n't have all the information to include or exclude italy . 
  first , the italian state has a primary budget surplus , so i would not be so severe to this country . 
  italy 's exports have held up surprisingly well , so it suggests that its competitiveness is not so bad ( although italian cost competitiveness is bad ) . 
  i just do n't get why italy 's situation is not worse , so i do n't automatically exclude them . 
  by the way , france was also fond of competitive devaluations and constant primary deficit , so with your argument excluding italy would mean excluding france . 
  i 'm answering to the question of whether france could stay in the eurozone . 
   breaking up the euro would make the new dmark explode in value , and they would pay by unemployment . 
  not exactly , because germany has a low price elasticity . 
  [ edited as my previous sentence did not mean anything ]  any proof that it did n't ? 
  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof  what can be proven is that it caused prices to converge [ prices have diverged ] ( https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ccyqfjaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cesifo-group.de%2fportal%2fpls%2fportal%2fdocs%2f1%2f1207591.pdf&amp;ei=zs8tvkjcj8avaslmgygl&amp;usg=afqjcng2uzru7bgx78lpllj3eiaul8hing&amp;sig2=xfe5awighvskwgk_cdhutg&amp;bvm=bv.76477589,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja ) . 
   the eu is the big post-war project of pacifist europe and the foremost tool of achieving goals through peaceful means in the whole of europe . 
  i do n't buy it . 
  dividing germany and developing nuclear weapons and new war tactics is what makes a war impossible in europe . 
  you ca n't invade a hostile country anymore . 
   adam smith disagrees define morale then . 
  [ smith rejected the idea that man was capable of forming moral judgements beyond a limited sphere of activity , again centered around his own self-interest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_theory_of_moral_sentiments ) . 
   the ecb brings money into circulation corresponding to last year 's inflation ( the inflation target is 2 % ) by dividing it evenly across all citizens in the eurozone . 
  this will help the poorest citizens the most while not having a very inflationary impact in the richer countries . 
  it [ widens the gap between countries ] ( https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ccyqfjaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cesifo-group.de%2fportal%2fpls%2fportal%2fdocs%2f1%2f1207591.pdf&amp;ei=zs8tvkjcj8avaslmgygl&amp;usg=afqjcng2uzru7bgx78lpllj3eiaul8hing&amp;sig2=xfe5awighvskwgk_cdhutg&amp;bvm=bv.76477589,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja ) and does not help the poor at all . 
   so your point is that i do n't know as much about monetary policy as milton friedman and at the same time that i used an ad-hominem falacy in my post ? 
  nope . 
  read my comment again . 
   inflation is very much related to monetary policy . 
  inflation is also related to structural components of the economy , that 's why [ spain is in deflation now and germany is n't ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/low-german-inflation-puts-pressure-on-ecb-1409229055 ) . 
   that 's why the us decided long ago that every state had to have its own currency . 
  see my comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2i0m3i/france_produces_no_austerity_budget_defying_eu/cky2qtb ) : * more integration means more transfers to poor countries . 
  which means germany has to pay at some point . 
  i do n't want to seem pessimistic but i do n't see that happening in the future . 
  * * so please tell me how do you make germans and germany accept to pay each year an equivalent of 2 % of their gdp ( net transfers between states in the us ) to ensure economic integration of greece , spain , or portugal ? 
   that `` maybe italy '' you added reveals that you do n't know a thing about monetary policy and are repeating the national front slogans like a parrot . 
  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem the fact that you 're reacting this way with insults reveals that you do n't want a rational debate . 
  i explained my comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2i0m3i/france_produces_no_austerity_budget_defying_eu/cky2qtb ) .
