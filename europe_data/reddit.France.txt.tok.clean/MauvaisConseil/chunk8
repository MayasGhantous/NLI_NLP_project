  [ they come from very different backgrounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_australia#country_of_birth_of_australian_residents ) . 
  you ca n't compare immigrants from asia and immigrants from sub-saharan africa . 
  studies show that they have very different backgrounds when it comes to [ marrying ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cousin_marriage#current_status ) , having children and [ educating ] ( http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/63608/telechargement_fichier_fr_insee.r.f.rences.pdf ) them . 
  people from asia and oecd countries score higher in school and integrate well ( low unemployment and high mixed marriages ) , whereas people from maghreb , turkey and some parts of africa have low school results , live in closed communities with many children . 
  this leads to very different results when it comes to [ the cost of immigration ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/imo2013.htm ) : immigrants benefit oecd countries , except germany and france , where they cost 0,52 % of gdp each year . 
  edit : i forgot a edit2 : i 'm sorry you 're being downvoted for having a different opinion . 
   a lot of the people who support them now also supported her father when he was being openly racist . 
  first , that 's not true at all , majority of the fn hates the bad press brought by jean-marie le pen . 
  there was an opinion poll which showed that 2/3 of fn voters thought that jmlp was a millstone for the party . 
  could you please define racist ? 
  he stated that `` the islamo-arab world was a death threat for our civilisation '' . 
  he also said that the gas chambers were `` a detail in the history of wwii '' . 
  finally , he said that `` when muslims will be 25 millions in france , they will rule france and french will have to hug the walls '' . 
  do you think that these sentences are racists , or were you referring to something else ? 
   that does n't mean that there 's mass third world immigration . 
  5,3 millions immigrants lived in france in 2008 . 
  there 's 200 000 new immigrants each year . 
  43 % of them come from africa . 
  overall there was 12 millions immigrants and children of immigrants living in france in 2008 . 
  immigration from sub-saharan africa has increased by 44 points between 1999 and 2008 . 
  is that massive enough for you ? 
  edit : meanwhile , the number of french nationals living outside france has grown substantially over the past decade , increasing by over 60 % since 2000 at an average annual growth rate of 4 % . 
  today , close on 1,611,054 million french nationals are registered as living abroad .

  all data comes from governmental studies . 
  the definition of immigrant used is `` person born foreigner in a foreign country '' . 
  this definition is stricter than usual definition of immigrant ( person who was born in a foreign country ) . 
  edit2 : i 'm putting all the data from different conversations in this post , for later use you ca n't compare immigrants from asia and immigrants from sub-saharan africa .

  what we need is a highly educated or rich immigration , at least to make up for the departures of our brains . 
  we do not need poor and uneducated immigration , that can not find a job with our 14,7 % unemployment rate ( only 54 % of non-eu immigrants actually work , and only 15 % of immigrants come to france for a job ) . 
  remember that population in france was 28 millions in 1800 , 38 millions en 1900 , and 65,7 millions in 2014 . 
  in the us , it was 3 millions in 1800 , 75 millions in 1900 , and 314 millions in 2014 . 
  for australia it was 5200 in 1800 , 4 millions in 1900 and 22,7 millions in 2014 . 
  we do n't have the same notions of growth , the numbers do not mean the same thing for us and for you . 
   would you say she is more like nigel farage than nick griffin who is an actual fascist ? 
  definitely . 
  she clearly respects the institutions and the electoral process and has achieved a normalisation of the party . 
  first of all , your graphics have gdp on the left scale and gdp growth on the right scale   from 1960 till 2014 . 
  i do n't really see why we should begin in 1960 or even with the treaty of rome because there are now 21 more countries in eu . 
  one should compare growth before integration in the eurozone and growth after integration in the eurozone . 
  the * de gaulle * years were pretty far from what can be called eu . 
   second of all :  [ graph of e.u. 
  's gdp growth from january 1960 to january 2013 . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp ) now compare it with countries outside of eu like norway , switzerland or the us, 
  why i hate the european union ? 
  well : * economic stagnation * deflation * unemployment * undemocratic institutions * no respect for the 2005 referendum * no control on immigration * submission to us interests ( ttip etc. ), 
  * demographic stagnation * encouragement of tax fraud and tax evasion * encouragement of fiscal and social competition * lowering of social conditions, 
  thanks , 
  and 800 million in 2013 . 
  we had a camp in sangatte but the migrants were really violent with numerous fights and murders . 
  there are many security problems in these camps , the migrants do n't hesitate to burn them if they are not happy with their conditions . 
  the camp in sangatte was closed after british minister david blunkett asked us to close it . 
  could you please make a quick tl ; dr for those of us who hesitate watching the whole video ? 
   i would rather a unified europe that would challenge the u.s both economically and militarily . 
  yes , but i do n't believe this can happen anytime soon . 
  current eu is dominated by us interests . 
  we 've been lied to so many times : the eu was supposed to compete with the us , and we are now making the ttip , we have given galileo 's codes to the us , we are still part of us dominated nato etc. 
  it 's simply not working , we do n't have common interests yet . 
   so you would sooner france be allied and associated with russia than the west ? 
  honest question , not trying to be rude i would rather have a balance of powers instead of a too powerful us . 
  in my ideal world , there should be a competition with the us , so basically anything to limit their influence is good as long as it does not cost france . 
  i do n't feel particularly tied to the us , or even feel that i share common values with us policy in the last 40 years . 
  so if that means being neutral to both russia and the us , then i would tend to do this . 
  currently i feel that we support the us too much , and criticize or sanction russia too much . 
   call it friendship or call it long-term interests , but the eu has it for ukraine . 
  ukraine is not a friend of france . 
  we do not care about ukraine . 
  we do not share any common history with this country . 
  russia , on the other way , has been a long time ally of france , with a long history of [ francophilia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francophile#russia ) in russia . 
   in 20 years , when the eu has recovered from financial issues and is growing well , we 're going to have a high upward pressure on inflation and fiscal stability unless we can add to the labour force lol . 
  we have unemployment at 20 % if we count all kinds of unemployed people . 
  if immigration is needed , it will come from france 's former colonies , not ukraine . 
   you 're quoting statesmen where one , by the way , is singlehandedly responsible for the european union being less integrated today than it should have been . 
  if by `` less integrated '' , you mean `` less influenced by the us '' , then i agree . 
   norway would have been a member and the uk would likely not have ended up as skeptical if it were n't for de gaulle . 
  uk was [ bandwagoning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandwagoning ) the us . 
  they never wanted an independent europe , which was what de gaulle wanted , and the reason why he did not want what we have now : a divided and weak eu . 
  basically every prediction he has made on this issue has been right : weak economy , no army and weak international weight . 
   he may not have wanted to call it friendship , but he failed to see long-term interests for his nations , and for all europeans he clearly saw what was in the interests of the us . 
  now tell me , apart from lowering wages and more competition for workers , what can ukraine bring to us ? 
  we do not share common interests , that 's why we ca n't have a common policy . 
  maybe kosovo ? 
  i 'm not sure though , i do n't really know the details of what happened in kosovo . 
  from what i remember it was about the same context : independentists / terrorists that were backed up by external intervention . 
  ok , so between 1967 and 1969 , france and a few other counties immersed 14 000 tons of weakly radioactive waste at 4000 meters deep in the ocean . 
  in 1969 , our storage center was finished and we stopped these immersions in the atlantic . 
   in the past they dumped some of it in the channel do you have any source ? 
  seems weird as we have more than 1000 sites where nuclear waste is stocked . 
  only 13 % of used uranium is sent to russia to be enriched . 
  it 's quite complicated : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestion_des_d%c3%a9chets_radioactifs_en_france#classification, 
  more like 60 years ago : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_community, 
   once people vote en masse people wo n't vote en masse as they are more and more convinced that governments are unable to fight the lobbies and the power of money . 
  they just want to get rid of the current politicians . 
   do n't worry she will never win the second round ( ballot ) will lost with something 30 % more like 35 / 40 % if voters follow the same behaviour than in the last local elections ( about half of left wing voters go to the fn in the second round if it 's a duel between right wing and fn , about 2/3 of right wing voters go to the fn in the second round if it 's a duel between fn and left wing ) .

   people should n't attack jews because they do n't like israel . 
  jews are n't automatically israeli and even if they were , they still do n't necessarily agree with what their state does .
