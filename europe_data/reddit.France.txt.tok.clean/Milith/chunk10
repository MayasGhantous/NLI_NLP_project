  i thought we did n't have those in western europe anymore . 
  if there 's one thing france is really good at , it 's killing regional languages . 
  the unsung hero of this thread . 
  kebab is n't exclusively drunk food . 
  a shining example of europe working together , is n't it beautiful ? 
  from ... ... walthamstow !, 
  people are n't supposed to downvote opinions they disagree with . 
  this is how you kill debate and create an echo chamber . 
  seconded , the current circus is an unjustifiable embarrassment . 
  i 'm surprised they did n't kill the grandmother in the `` inside the eu '' vid . 
  i 've been told that there are lots of tech jobs in cork already . 
  #bernie 2016 i still believe, 
  god hates britain since henry viii . 
  i love you , executivemonkey . 
  also italy . 
  and the other two thirds do n't !, 
  is n't diversity amazing ? 
   the sense of community . 
  which size does that community need to be ? 
  your close family ? 
  your clan ? 
  your tribe ? 
  your city ? 
  your region ? 
  your country ? 
  the eu ? 
  is it though, 
  how do you think poland will be partitioned this time ? 
  there 's no way those talks wo n't be influenced by the brexit situation . 
   well deserved to be in such a high position in the most powerful organisation in the entire world   til juncker is the potus . 
   most european countries were too economically and socially shattered after ww ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ ** 1 ** and had learned that the price of military conquest can be too great . 
  sure but that 's not what happens with this kind of law . 
  i 'm not an expert on the application of the loi gayssot or similar laws , but from what i 'm reading it does n't look like it allows for healthy debate . 
   and if someone reaches thr conclusion that jews are inferior or that the holocaust never happened then they committed fraud at one point or another . 
  i do n't think that is for lawmakers to decide , but scientists and historians , on a case by case basis . 
  let peer review do its work . 
  in science you ca n't say a study is fraudulent because it reached a conclusion that goes against the current consensus , you do it if the methodology is demonstrably wrong . 
  it 's a very important distinction . 
   laws pass because people agree with them . 
  do you want a referendum on death penalty ? 
  also , that 's a complete non-argument . 
  how are we supposed to try to change peoples minds if the only debate we can have is `` well , people do n't agree with you so get fucked '' . 
  come on , i 've seen you post a lot on this forum , you 're better than this . 
  if i was a historian i 'd probably not risk doing anything slightly controversial in that area of study . 
   the uk is one of the few countries that have more faith in their national government than the european government . 
  i wonder if things will change now that it 's becoming apparent that the two most prominent members of the majority decided to risk damaging social cohesion and throwing their country into a recession for personal gain . 
  it was a puppet state nonetheless . 
  well there 's farage ... 
  cheeky, 
  i use the same laptop at home and at work . 
  i have a spare monitor on both my desks . 
  can we please stop the shitslinging ? 
  nobody asked for this . 
   there is no chance that a similar referendum could succeed in any other member states at present . 
  as much as i 'd like to agree with you , i would n't be so sure . 
   this is democracy [ debatable ] ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brexit-democratic-failure-for-uk-by-kenneth-rogoff-2016-06?referrer=/dif13gijpi )  the idea that somehow any decision reached anytime by majority rule is necessarily `` democratic '' is a perversion of the term . 
  modern democracies have evolved systems of checks and balances to protect the interests of minorities and to avoid making uninformed decisions with catastrophic consequences . 
  the greater and more lasting the decision , the higher the hurdles . 
   that 's why enacting , say , a constitutional amendment generally requires clearing far higher hurdles than passing a spending bill . 
  yet the current international standard for breaking up a country is arguably less demanding than a vote for lowering the drinking age . 
  what about politicians giving up their livelihood when they never show up for work , like everyone who works a `` proper job '' ? 
  juncker calling orban a dictator to his face then casually slapping him * is * pretty amazing . 
  why is luxembourg a country anyway ? 
  i still do n't know what to think of this guy . 
  he makes some good points then goes on and insults the entire audience . 
  can we have constructive criticism of the eu without pointless shitslinging ? 
   china , america and the commonwealth made it clear they 're going to bend the eu over a table if they do n't give the uk a soft hand . 
  source on that , if you do n't mind ? 
   completely agree that fptp is an awful system they should have a referendum to change it to some alternative system of voting . 
  a resurgence in catalonian separatism will probably cause scottish independence to fail . 
  he 'll be able to blame the eu once he gets screwed over trade deals . 
  do n't be so harsh , 48 % of them voted against it . 
  yea that makes no sense at all . 
  brexit will have very diverse and unforeseen consequences , there are lots of related issues that are worth talking about and putting them all on the same thread really kills visibility . 
  this is the biggest eu related story of 2016 ( of the decade ? 
  ) , you ca n't restrain it to a * m\u00e9gasujet * , there 's nothing more important than it today . 
  it 's 4am , so no . 
  i do n't think the other european leaders would approve , it would set a bad precedent . 
  you do n't want an union where people can come and go depending on the weather . 
  pretty sure hollande said something along those lines earlier this week . 
  look at [ the vote map ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results ) . 
   this can go either way indeed , i 'm super nervous . 
  the uk will still have to comply with a bunch of eu regulations if they want to trade ( which they will ) , but now they wo n't have a say in it anymore . 
  the sovereignty question is not as clear cut as you make it . 
  no , i 'm paraphrasing in a way that brings extra context to the result . 
   people who do n't have to compete with migrants for their jobs tend to vote remain same thing with trump in the us . 
  the fuck is that supposed to mean, 
   but they could n't and would n't be part of the eu . 
  israel is more than just ashkenazi jews . 
  what 's the implication here ? 
   i ca n't see a downside other than that half of our people have left . 
  is n't brain drain a major issue in lithuania right now ? 
  trump will kill it . 
   in canada there are entire suburbs where english is the second language . 
  there 's actually an entire province , and it 's a big pretty big one . 
   but i know a few people who are attending a brexit party with ** champagne ** as i write this , which might tell you something that they enjoy being in a common market with france ? 
  should the national team have quotas for white people ? 
  how much of your ancestry should be white for you to count as white ? 
  so many questions . 
  i remember when i discovered that sub .
