  i thought it was amazing for like 3 days , until i realized the people in there were worse than those they were making fun of . 
  the nazis really ruined a beautiful saying . 
  rigged, 
  how much the government is supposed to interfere with a kid 's upbringing is still an ongoing debate . 
  it 's easier to blow yourself up for an ideology if said ideology tells you you 'll be rewarded in the afterlife for doing so . 
  beautiful . 
   the human spirit is that part of yourself which can not be nourished by mountain dew and cheetos alone . 
  that 's why you add social interaction , videogames and the occasional trip to the beach . 
   if the son of arab immigrants renamed himself into hanz gruber , became a christian or an atheist , married a local woman and dressed in european fashion - he would 100 % be accepted alright then i 'm a bit confused about what your point of view is . 
  i thought ancestry was a big factor in national identity for you , and that 's what i was arguing against . 
   that those who have adopted alternative views of what the community is are trying to impose them on those who chose to remain with the established criteria of ancestry . 
  some of them do n't really have a choice , do they ? 
  second and third generation germans might not have another nation to go to , so if they do n't include themselves in the german nation then they do n't belong anywhere . 
  it 's not very fair to them . 
  and is it because , or despite nationalism ? 
  they could have been in the union already if they did n't decide to revolt . 
  once you realize every country is the answer to a single question the test becomes way easier . 
  sure , but you can imagine an election where one outcome is alright for everyone , while the other outcome is marginally better for 51 % of the population and catastrophic for 49 % . 
  if everyone voted with only their interests in mind , the second outcome would be selected even though it 's not the best outcome for the country as a whole . 
  all drunk drivers decided to drink and drive . 
  not all pakistanis decided to be pakistanis . 
  this is bait, 
   masters from mechanical engineering should be paid more than say electrician or plumber not if the job market has no use for them . 
   if a plumber or a construction worker makes more than an engineer who spent 5-7 years to get his/her education , i think it is a problem . 
  tell that to history majors and they 'll laugh at you . 
  which ranking is better at predicting results ? 
  ( 1 ) is really poorly phrased . 
   i 'd say just gang up on them as well #racewar now, 
  reluctant upvote of the day . 
  i 've eaten terrible pizza in the most touristy spots of rome . 
   nothing good to gain . 
  [ as of 1.17 ] ( https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/eu4-1-17-released-now-checksum-f236.928374/ ) you can now get spanish ideas by forming spain as portugal . 
  the discipline and morale are really good . 
  are n't you ? 
  the article only talks about college education . 
  maybe this group is benefiting from affirmative action even though they do n't suffer from the burdens affirmative action is supposed to compensate for ? 
  interesting article for sure . 
  so usa & buddies ? 
  the difference is that the american sphere of influence is way bigger than the russian . 
   `` hey what are they saying '' ( when there is spanish on tv , radio etc. ), 
  even though that 's a pretty ignorant question , it 's easy for portuguese speakers to understand spanish . 
  edit : i bet i would n't get downvoted if i had a brazilian flair instead . 
  bah who cares , wikipedia is a tool of anglo-saxon imperialism . 
  that one time i got lost in antartica , french really came in handy when asking the penguins for directions . 
  not using the word `` hate '' regarding people who want to preserve their national sovereignty would go a long way . 
  i say that as someone who leans towards federalism . 
  i wish you good luck in your future endeavors . 
  good thing they 're not racist at all in there . 
  it 's actually pretty ridiculous how centralized france is . 
  no , buy them from france . 
  this is completely beside the point . 
  the global community feeling i 'm talking about exists even if it does n't include every single muslim sect to the same degree . 
  the nationality of the attacker is irrelevant . 
  they see themselves as part of a global muslim community , and when the west attacks one muslim country they fight back regardless of what country it is . 
  i fixed the formatting : -- ** journalist ** : philippe poutou can you please turn to us ? 
  what is an exemplary president for you ? 
  -- ** poutou ** : i 'm not going to answer directly the question ( ... ) -- ** journalist ** : why not ? 
  -- ** poutou ** : ( ... ) because , when we talk about morality in politics , we are served for some times . 
  we 've heard of old stories for a long time , about cheating , stealing , lying ... we 've recently heard of dassault , condemned to prison , dassault is a politician , billionaire , boss of the figaro ( ... ) -- ** journalist ** : there are a lot of names given but not a lot of propositions -- ** poutou ** : ( ... ) no , it 's because i do n't wear a tie that you can interrupt me . 
  -- ** journalist ** : oh no , not at all ... -- ** poutou ** : the question is talking about the current situation . 
  so dassault does n't go to prison because he is too old , humanitarian clause , good for him !, 
  beside that , we have balkany , this is a whole piece of work , the father , the son , everyone cheats . 
  so we are in this context . 
  since january , this a delight , superb campaign !, 
  fillon , in front of me , everything but stories , the more we search , the more we feel corruption , the more we feel cheating . 
  on top of that , they are guys who tell us that we need rigour , that we need austerity and , themselves , nab the public money , so there 's a little problem -- ** fillon ** : no , mister poutou ( ... ) -- ** poutou ** : no , mister fillon , you 're going to be able to speak later ( ... ) -- ** fillon ** : do n't accuse like that , thank you ( ... ) -- ** poutou ** : so , what i 've said , i 've said it . 
  then we have le pen , maybe she 's going to react as well ... 
  le pen , this is the same thing , she nabs public money , this time it 's not here , but in europe . 
  for someone anti-european , it does n't bother her to nab european money . 
  the worst is that the fn , who says to be anti-system , does n't piss of at all , and protect itself thanks to the laws of the system , thanks to parliamentarian immunity !, 
  so she refuses to go to police summons , she 's chilled !, 
  -- ** le pen ** : this time you 're at police 's side ( ... ) -- ** poutou ** : yes , but when us , we 're summoned by the police , for example , we do n't have labour immunity , sorry ... ( public claps ) -- ** poutou ** : the system protects you , good for you !, 
  this anti-system is bullshit !, 
  now , i 'm going to end up talking about this political world . 
  us , we think that the problem of corrupt politicians is widespread ... i 'm not telling you everyone is like that , but there 's a problem due to the professionalisation of politics . 
  we have guys disconnected from the people , overpaid , 6000 , 7000 , 10,000 $ , mps , senators , ministers , and this scandalous . 
  i remind you that the minimum wage today is 1,100 $ , that there 's a lot of people living under poverty line , about 9 million people , this scandalous and disgusting . 
  everything i tell you about , a lot of people twitted me , messaged me , `` go on , do n't give a damn , we 're fed up . '', 
  so , we think that we have to limit the wages of politicians . 
  the maximum would be the average wage !, 
  -- ** journalist ** : and this would make the politicians less corrupt to lower their wages ? 
  -- ** poutou ** : at least , they would chase less after the position , i think , being paid less . 
  and they would maybe be more interested to increase the wages because they would be directly affected . 
  ( public claps ) -- ** journalist ** : please , we 're in the presidential debate , everyone gives his opinion , but no reaction from the public -- ** m\u00e9lenchon ** : me , i can react , i can clap . 
  maybe they 're closed minded little imperalists ? 
   this poll is purposely giving a small percentage of the population a much much larger weight in this poll and it is not representative of the people at all . 
  it 's giving them the exact weight they had at the 2015 election . 
  what better method do you have ? 
  party membership and seats at the house are horrible metrics . 
  you 're trying to discredit this poll just because you do n't like the results . 
  i 'm done here , have a nice day . 
  i find it curious that you would say this poll is not representative of the public then you go on and say this :  the ukip has 200 and the conservative has 581 . 
  yet , there are 330 conservative seats and 1 ukip seat in the house of commons . 
  the house of commons is n't representative of public opinion , because of first past the post . 
  party membership is n't a good metric either . 
  the share of each party in this poll is pretty close to the [ voting share in the 2015 election ] ( http://www.ukpolitical.info/2015.htm ) . 
  that 's what they were going for . 
  it 's a yougov poll . 
  their general methodology is explained here : https://yougov.co.uk/about/panel-methodology/, 
  intriguing .
