  the article is very neutral , they 're just reporting the facts and adding some context . 
  maybe they edited it during the night . 
  this is grounds for violent protest . 
  what he 's saying is that the willingness of a country to initiate a war of aggression is a big deal even if the economy is n't that strong . 
  a jingoistic leader backed by his people will have a lot more influence on the international scale . 
  how many other countries could get away with land grabs in europe right now ? 
  gdp does n't tell the whole story . 
   on their left m\u00e9lenchon is more charismatic and appreciated . 
  * this is what r/france posters actually believe . 
  * m\u00e9lenchon is le pen 's best shot at a 2nd round win . 
  marine ( or her father ) ran for president at every election since 1988 . 
  this is the strongest they 've ever been but her potential voters wo n't go up by 15 % in 4 months . 
  thanks for the statistics , i did a quick search and could n't find any . 
  let 's see how this evolves now that trump is actually doing things . 
  people i 've talked to ( i spent a couple weeks in the uk around christmas ) , and the general feel i 'm getting from the media and the anglophone internet in general . 
  i do n't think trump is popular in the uk but he probably has a stronger following there than in france or germany . 
  it 's all conjecture of course . 
   british people certainly do n't support trump , no more than any other european country oh i really do n't think that 's true . 
  i 'm willing to bet money that if we had an european poll on approval of trump the uk would be at or near the top . 
  azerbaijan is technically sort of europe . 
  i have found my people . 
  varoufakis does n't want the eu to go away . 
  his position is that the euro was a mistake , but now that it happened leaving the euro would be even worse . 
  i think it 's pretty obvious at this point to anyone that has been paying attention . 
  there 's also a big difference in what `` fight a war '' entails for people in ukraine or france . 
  that 's how representative democracies work . 
  the only incentive politicians have to do what the people want is reelection . 
  it 's tyrell wellick . 
  inherit the burgundy . 
  argentina with the `` no data available '' color just to make things confusing . 
   i have never seen one of these politicians being willing to talk to the eu about what they consider to be problems . 
  they do n't want a solution , they want to gain votes and power by using emotional , hate filled propaganda . 
  counterpoint : [ here ] ( https://www.euractiv.fr/section/politique/news/un-cordon-sanitaire-anti-fn-se-forme-au-parlement-europeen/ ) 's a situation where a front national mep wanted to introduce very sensible legislation against pesticide that 's harmful to bees . 
  the other parties banded up together and decided to not vote on it , just so they could introduce it themselves later . 
  the stated reason is they did n't want to cooperate in any way with a party that wants to destroy the eu . 
  if like myself you believe that european institutions should be used to deal with the issues these nationalist parties have ( instead of just blowing everything up ) , then there should be zero tolerance towards this type of bullshit . 
  as long as other parties flat out refuse to work with them on principle this argument does n't work . 
  it does n't matter . 
  his goal is to discredit the media . 
  he wo n't be able to use it for his geopolitical goals unless he somehow manages to tame them but that would be very surprising . 
  except trump is waging war on the american media right now . 
  the currency is n't the best aspect of the current eu package tbh . 
  lmao i did n't even know the primary was today and i 'm usually pretty well informed on this stuff . 
  for those interested , hamon 's main proposition is an universal basic income . 
   i do n't want a single entity to dominate the globe again . 
  i do n't want europe to become late 20th century america this wo n't happen . 
  it 's pretty clear at this point that the 21st century will be multipolar . 
  the eu will either be a united power that can stand alongside us and china or it wil die out and europe will become another playground for american and chinese influence . 
  i feel like the information density in this is a lot higher than what trump is used to . 
  not enough rambling and unrelated tangents . 
  huh , good catch , all he does is post politico articles . 
  the angevin empire was created by marriage between a norman king of england ( sort of french ) and eleanor of aquitaine ( french ) . 
  i remember r/ukpolitics being overwhelmingly pro-brexit shortly after the referendum , in open opposition to r/unitedkingdom , did it change ? 
  aww so cute, 
   all europe has to do is keep european talent in . 
  our social model does n't really incentivize that though . 
  now that i got my free high quality upper education in france i could move to the us and get paid double what companies offer me here . 
  [ he still has to pretend though ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/08/12/trump_art_of_the_deal_is_my_second_favorite_book_first_is_the_bible.html ) , which might actually be even more ridiculous . 
  there 's no perfect voting system . 
  [ it 's mathematically impossible . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arrow's_impossibility_theorem ), 
  sure but hsbc has huge ties to china . 
  i was providing some context so that people do n't think this rebasing to china thing was completely baseless and random . 
  ** h ** ongkong and ** s ** hanghai ** b ** anking ** c ** orporation, 
  never change , / u/executivemonkey . 
  look at his post history . 
  if you came here for serious discussion you should probably ignore this kid . 
  well it happened 600 years ago for you guys . 
  he 's the most obvious troll i 've seen today and i spend way too much time on reddit . 
  that 's one way of dealing with the calais migrant situation . 
  the factories will be somewhere else but tesla europe llc will be headquartered in a luxembourgish postbox do n't worry . 
  the current us government will clearly attempt to undermine the eu . 
  israel is in eurovision , does that count ? 
   working my ass off, 
  alright can you give some `` non bullshit '' reasons why luxembourg is more than twice as rich as germany ? 
  i 'm willing to listen . 
   ever since everybody is their own news broadcaster on facebook and we 've been talking about politicising and democratising everything we are having these problems . 
  is it really better when broadcasting corporations have the monopoly of news but they all cater to their specific public and keep spinning every single event to promote their own worldview ? 
  at the core the issue is that people love having their opinions repeated back at them whereas any challenging idea is met with instinctive resistance and skepticism . 
  social media amplifies this phenomenon but it 's nothing new . 
  can we just annex luxemburg and call it a day ? 
  government still pays for contractors . 
  different countries have different degrees of privatization , which implies different budget sizes for similar economies . 
  you ca n't privatize the military . 
  military spending as a percentage of gdp makes a lot more sense . 
  bojo 's french is actually really good though . 
   english is one and one only - apart from some minor differences in diction and spelling . 
  i do n't know man . 
  fawlty towers english and the wire english might as well be different languages if you turn subtitles off . 
  even if it means giving the presidency to pence or ryan ? 
  it feels like a great outcome to the republican establishment . 
  could be a very short term with a quick impeachment if this info is confirmed . 
  this pic was taken in marseille actually . 
  la d\u00e9fense is a business district just outside of paris . 
  i hope you 're right but i 'm not as optimistic . 
  what would you call it ? 
   but we need to balance the stability of those countries with the pressure we build up for them to act in a way we want . 
  ok but what about the pressure the current migrant situation is creating on the european project ? 
  we 're about to lose 70 years of joint work because our leaders are unable to make tough decisions . 
  oh the humanity,
