this is a personal list , i do n't know much about her work . 
  so aznavour is also armenian and is attached to his armenian roots . 
  he speaks perfectly french , and is a great amongst the great , a success story \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise . 
  politically he 's a big advocate for france to recognize the genocide that happened in 1917 . 
  i do n't . 
  i think her version is awfully bad . 
  it 's probably wrong for europe and i can say with certainty that this is wrong for france . 
  for clarification : a 9 months old pregnant mother is driving a car , she 's about to give birth , a drunk truck driver kills both her and the baby she was carrying in her womb , it 's a single homicide not a double homicide . 
  baby dies 1 hour after mother gave birth : he was alive legally speaking . 
  baby is delivered dead : he was never alive legally speaking . 
  i have a tendency to write long posts , so i 'll try to be short . 
  i have stances on the topic , but i 'll try to just list facts and keep my personal experience for the end . 
  violent muslims in europe : yes , but the main motives are greed or drug-trafficking , the fact they are muslim is not unrelated , but not primordial . 
  the ethnicity of the victims and aggressors in those day-to-day crimes is relevant in my opinion , but the major part of the media and the judicial system do n't take it into account ( in the us you would say that the victim is `` caucasian/american-african '' , we do n't do that , it 's just a victim ) . 
  jihadists recruiters are indeed popular amongst a part of the population that rejects democracy and embrace islam as their sole identity . 
  there is a direct link between drug trafficking and the financing of the islamic state and aqmi . 
  active radical islamists are a minority amongst the muslim population , but the public have no numbers as to how many they really are . 
  muslim have a hard time integrating into french society because it is based on christian roots and a radical and effective seperation of state and church , two things that are completely foreign to the arab world ( turkey of course , is not arab ) . 
  some tolerance values also clash really hard with islam , such as the tolerance of gay people . 
  contrary to the bible who is a collection of myths , the quran is in one block and is `` god 's words '' , so it can not be interpreted as much as the bible . 
  it is a religion that clashes with our system of values , as it contains a fair number of political regulations . 
  `` render unto caesar the things that are caesar 's , and unto god the things that are god 's '' is a concept that is applicable to all of europe . 
  in islam , it 's hard to concieve power and law without the shariah in mind ( except if you 're turkey , but keeping their secularism is an everyday fight for the turkish people , and it 's also true for france now ) . 
  the threat of terrorist attacks is real but our intelligence services are well connected and do monitor radical islam activity . 
  but i think we have an edge there because france experienced a lot of terrorist attacks in the 90 's and 60 's . 
  not to say the risk is zero , it is certainly not , mohammed merah is still fresh in the memories of many frenchmen . 
  now and this is biased and not necessarily representative ; my personal experience with the muslim community is mixed . 
  i 've met some that were perfectly integrated and lived in harmony with their religion and their political ideas . 
  it 's not always the poorest or the dumber that are n't integrated or the most radical . 
  a lot of terrorist or actually very smart and educated . 
  i 've been called `` a filthy french '' and threatened with a knife once , my blond ( and this is relevant ) ex-girlfriend has once been called a slut and got spat on for wearing a skirt by a fully veiled woman . 
  she got beaten once when she was 17 because she did n't have a cigarette to give to one of her aggressor ( happens a lot , it 's a pretext , my muslim friend told me that the cigarette they ask is a `` dhimmi tax '' and that if you do n't pay it , they consider that you must be punished , but take that with a pinch of salt ) . 
  you do realize this comment is extremely insulting ? 
  these are not colonies . 
  do you go to hawai and call out the americans for not letting go `` their colony '' ? 
  no , because this is an integral part of their country . 
  same here . 
  no she 's not . 
  you 're being anachronic . 
  the fn did n't exist in 1939 , contrary to the sfio which is the socialist party . 
  14 out of 17 members of the sfio executive collaborated with the germans during ww2 . 
  the fn 's roots is poujade 's party , which is post-ww2 . 
  and that 's not glorious either . 
  saying that le pen is the ideological successor of p\u00e9tain is a blatant lie and should n't be upvoted . 
  probably . 
  i lurk a lot and only contribute to the topic when i have a bit of knowledge regarding the subject at hand ... which is linked to my own country , most of the time . 
  usa is not a european country , therefore a lot of users might not contribute but still read and upvote . 
  to be honest , the subreddit i spend the most time on is r/soccer and i 've never even posted a comment there . 
  does n't mean i do not upvote . 
  also and this is important , r/europe is a default sub for every european redditor ( i think ? 
  ) , so there must be a substantial amount of lurkers or inactive accounts , because every european redditor might not want to get involved in this sub 's discussions ( for a few years , the only sub i would visit was r/dota2 and this sub was never on my radar ) . 
  third but not last , i understand that american values are often questioned here , but there are countries and flairs that are the object of way more negative and less nuanced comments such as russia , france ( even worse if you 're from paris ) or almost any arabic country . 
  people do n't quite do that here , but for the sake of comparison whenever germany is mentioned in a thread elsewhere , there is always a nazi reference in it , and for the french , there is always a surrender joke ... 
  i have n't seen anything quite like this about americans here . 
  actually i have the very opposit impression . 
  r/europe is very america-friendly and dominated by an anglo-us userbase . 
  just check the statistics . 
  i think the us is the second-most or third-most represented country in this subreddit and britain is first by a substantial margin , so i highly doubt your perception is accurate . 
  south of france , coast of the med : netherlands , germany , denmark . 
  mostly . 
  great thread !, 
  let me add more about france . 
  check this video for [ the beast of g\u00e9vaudan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fytl50hqkm ) ( in english ! ) . 
  in britanny , clouded in mistery and druidic influences , we have [ ** the forest of broc\u00e9liande ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/broc%c3%a9liande ) . 
  a lot of arthurian tales written during the middle age took place in this forest . 
  again , in the west , we have [ ** the dreaded barbe-bleue ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bluebeard ) ( or bluebeard ) . 
  this guy actually existed . 
  gilles de rais , also known as barbe bleue was a lord from britanny who lived in the castle of tiffauges . 
  he was an enigmatic character and incredibly wealthy , legend says he was a practitioner of alchemy and satanic rituals . 
  he was condemned in 1440 for ( and that 's true ) raping and assissinating 140 children . 
  he was amalgamed with the folktale of charles perrault and a legend was born . 
  if you were in france during middle age , you might have witnessed a cat 's trial for sorcery . 
  ** the silver cat ** , mandragot or matagot , is , in britanny 's , gascony , provence and languedoc folklore , a cat , usually black and diabolical who was obtained by a sorcerer in exchange for his soul . 
  he 's supposed to roam around some mysterious places during the night and come back at dawn with gold coins for his master . 
  if his master neglects him or does n't reward him , the cat would get upset and become cruel . 
  sometimes a cat did n't serve one but nine masters , and led the last one to hell , according to the legend of course . 
  this is where the `` black cats are bad luck '' thing come from . 
  a [ ** farfadet ** ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/farfadet#mediaviewer/file:ryckaert,_david_iii_-_la_ronde_des_farfadets_de_les_farfadets_-_17th_c.jpg ) or follet spirit is an ugly little creature from the poitou and vendean mythology . 
  it 's not a mean creature . 
  they are half a meter tall , have no fingers or no noses depending on whether they are mountain farfadet or plain farfadets , they have no clothes or just ragged ones , and they often become serving spirits attached to a farm or a house where they help with the tasks . 
  they 'll sometimes beat the domestics with sticks if they are too lazy . 
  a classic one , the [ ** lutin ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lutin ) , i actually did n't know this one was n't widespread in europe . 
  the lutin is a humanoid and nocturnal creature of small height originating from the folklore and popular beliefs of certain regions of france such as the berry , normandy and picardy , in wallonia and the ardennes they are called nutons , and in britanny korigans , while in the alps , they call them servans . 
  so what does a lutin do exactly ? 
  they have the reputation to be playful , have a gift of metamorphosis and invisibility ( how convenient !, 
  ) , and they can both be good and bad . 
  they are obsessed with women , hence the french word `` lutiner '' ( roughly translated : to have naughty thoughts on someone ) , they are susceptible and they like to take care of human 's houses , and especially stables . 
  there are many many more . 
  for example m\u00e9lusine , a goddess-knight-fey that originated from the most ancient times and has equivalent in almost every culture , celtic , roman , and even scythian who has been an inspiration for female characters from ancients times to modern days . 
  if you ever played dota , the item heart of tarasque probably has a link with the provencal monster named ... tarasque , a six-legged dragon who haunted the swamps of tarascon , in the south of france . 
  made popular by roleplay games and video games , the wyvern , is also a monster that takes roots in the french mythology . 
  i 'm a supporter of marine le pen , and it 's not a thing that is up for debate , her winning the second turn is not realistic . 
  one of my favourite artist , and one of france 's most famous . 
  he is franco-armenian and has been pushing for france to recognize the armenian genocide . 
  here are a few songs you might have heard from him : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tprov7xedy la boh\u00eame ( there 's also an [ english version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzl7if4lsg8 ) but it 's not as good imho ) . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmabeo1m6vg emmenez-moi http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cndumhyjuw parce que tu crois, 
  i 'll toss discredit on any so-called expert or politician who uses the term islamophobia . 
  one should be free to criticize islam without having to be associated with racist ideology , and that 's what i 'll do . 
  i have a different take on it , it 's a bit controversial , i 'm in no way saying that my opinion is the truth , it 's just my experience . 
  the main muslim community of france is from algeria , and they have an identity crisis .
