   that 's the difference between building a democracy and importing one . 
  nobody imports the american democracy . 
  certainly not france . 
   instead of naturally being the best , like hillary clinton was in america hillary clinton was the best ? 
  she was so good she lost against donald trump . 
  i disagree . 
  macron 's vote is just as inflated as marine 's . 
  the main problem with that system is not the demography , it is the first past the post . 
  meaning , if i were living in a system with an electoral college i would n't even wake up on election day because in my region ( occitanie ) there is no way in hell le pen does n't win and i would have wanted to vote for macron . 
  but if you do n't have fptp , your voice counts , no matter who wins the region ... 
  the most populated region of france are paris and around , arvern and rhone-alps , and provence . 
  the first two go to em . 
  there are n't many swing states in the us . 
  if you do n't live in one , your vote is meaningless . 
  a democrat from alabama will never have his voice matter . 
  if you want to vote for the other elections , due to gerrymandering , your vote is also useless . 
  the whole american democratic system is a scam . 
  only a tiny minority part of the population can make a difference with their vote ( 12 % or around that iirc ) and among them , only a fraction votes , and they only have the choice between two parties . 
  i wonder how the abstention rate in the us is n't much higher than it already is . 
  it 's all a big show . 
  terrorist get their weapons on the black market . 
  this is not the goal of this legislation . 
  jupp\u00e9 's case was different he more or less took the fall for chirac and he did pay for it . 
  people did not hold it against him that much . 
  however as a rival fillon did . 
  he fell on his own sword there . 
  do n't you forget the primaries ? 
  jupp\u00e9 was annihilated there . 
  the card holders of lr do not want jupp\u00e9 . 
  they wanted fillon . 
  mine :d . in the south , along the coastline between perpignan and montpellier/n \u00eemes . 
  we even have cowboys . 
  42 % le pen in the first turn , and we have a bleu marine mp ( only two of them , they are rare !! ), 
  he hired a professional vocalist afterwards because he kind of `` broke '' his voice for a while and that was not very professional . 
  translation : me , i will carry it [ the project ] for the long term . 
  i will carry it to the very end . 
  but now , your responsability is to go everywhere in france to relay it and win . 
  what i want ( want want ) it 's that you ( you you ) everywhere , you make it win . 
  because it is our project . 
  long live the republic , long live france . 
  she rejected his advances in hs but he said he 'd come back to her and they got together when he came back to her after his studies , ~ ~ when he was much older ~ ~ 18 , i believe . 
  not at all . 
  uncertain people are not voting for her , but rather macron and other `` milder '' candidates . 
  her base is very fervent and that 's what makes the difference for her in a low turnout . 
  around 2 or 2.5 millions frenchmen and women around the world . 
  https://blog.chapkadirect.fr/chiffres-expatries-francais-2015/ scroll down a bit and you have a list per countries . 
  roughly half of them are concentrated between na ( 14 % ) , eu ( 37 % ) , non-eu europe ( 13 % ) . 
  you would n't . 
  he almost singlehandedly held a bridge against the spaniards for a very long time , the bridge defense of garigliano . 
  saint pierre et miquelon first . 
  i was not familiar with spain but it makes sense . 
  you guys are the most progressive on social issues in western europe . 
  in france though i am pretty sure there is a link between the under 30 birth rate drop and the unemployment crisis for the 18-30 . 
  women are not expected to be stay-at-home moms so they do n't have to choose between a career and a baby . 
  of course it could be much better still in that regard . 
  while immigration contributes to our fertility rate , it 's not the main factor at all . 
  the fertility rate is declining though , youngsters have a harder time getting jobs as early as they used to and a lot of baby boomers are dying . 
  i think that would explain spain 's fertility rate compared to france : a stable financial situation might be harder to get there for young people than in france . 
  afghanistan is more optimistic about the future than france . 
  it 's not even about unemployment . 
  well . 
  you can have a cake . 
  but if you eat the cake , the cake is gone . 
  you ca n't have the cake and eat it too . 
  iirc , the eu flag is to be next to the national flag in all circumstances . 
  i disagree completely . 
  fillon and m\u00e9lenchon fit in this if you look up their positions . 
  too simplistic , too random . 
  inaccurate and useless graph when thinking about the french system . 
  the left and right dichotomy has been outdated since the 70 's , maybe it 's time to move past that ? 
  authoritarian/libertarian does n't make much sense either . 
  i would try austerity v. reflation and opened society ( pro-globalization , eu , immigration etc. . . ) v. closed society . 
  lots of people have asked this question ( in english too ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5rd0zt/can_someone_give_me_a_summary_of_the_french/dd6brp3/ https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/64hthq/spanish_guy_here_could_you_explain_me_your/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/64vybf/anyone_care_to_explain_the_political_situation_in/, 
  there are supports macron should dismiss . 
  sh\u00e4uble is one of them . 
  him supporting macron makes him look bad in the eyes of the french electorate . 
  i do n't know man , maybe they just do n't feel turkish at all ? 
  i 've got a friend who was born in b\u00e9nin , he has the double nationality , but he does n't care about that country at all , it 's not his according to him . 
  yeah but he does n't write and upvote the articles himself . 
  meanwhile r/france is invaded by m\u00e9lenchon posts and people who 'd rather support le pen , fillon , or even macron are often aggressively attacked in the comments . 
  because assuming the intentions of / u/loulan to be `` raising suspicion against the french left '' instead of informing a foreign audience is an unjustified attack that is not only rude , but a symptom of a mentality akin to paranoid people who think the world is out to get them : you ca n't deduce his intentions just because he linked a time.com article . 
  being critical to m\u00e9lenchon is healthy . 
  / u/loulan is not out to smear the french left . 
  he 's obviously a secret agent of the french tourism industry acting in a plot to promote the country through the spam of landscape pictures on r/europe . 
  it would just be weird . 
  we do benefit more from our british and american allies militarily than any other eu nation . 
  as long as there is no european defence project france needs nato ressources to operate more efficiently than it could on its own . 
  it 's a matter of opinions . 
  the constitutional treaty that was shut down was a good start but he praises that it was shut down and lambasts the watered down lisbon treaty in the same sentence . 
  i much prefer macron 's take on it , m\u00e9lenchon is too extreme in his approach to negotiations and his foreign policy is a wildcard . 
  i 'd be all for leaving the integrated command of nato , but not nato itself , and i do n't like him being cozy with russia . 
  yes he does but his reform program is much deeper . 
  ttps : / / www.facebook.com/ina.fr/videos/1331984670181282/ cr\u00eapes : - 1 pith of vanilla pods - 2 large pinches of salts - sugar , around 4 tablespoon - 1/4 liter milk - 400gr flour ( make a well ) - 2 tablespoon of oil - 8 eggs , if you need more , put more eggs in it ( eggs go into the well you made with the flour ) - work it with a whip for a few minutes until it 's lean - incorporate the warm milk ( with vanilla aroma ) and the melted butter ( 100gr ) - for flavor : add some pastis ( see video ) - add some rhum ( 1/4 liter ) , this is the main flavor ( 1/3 pastis , 2/3 rhum ) . 
  - add some beer , quantity does n't matter . 
  the dough must be liquid ( see video ) , add as much beer as needed . 
  temperature must be slightly tepid . 
  - now you are ready to cook the cr\u00eapes . 
  - no butter on the pan , you pour the dough on a very hot pan , you flip them by hand . 
  add some sugar if you want . 
  macron and le pen both want to make the legislative election proportional so the weight of the two main parties is not disproportionate ( currently a two turn winner take all situation , that 's why the fn only has 2 or 3 seats even though a lot of people voted for them ) .
