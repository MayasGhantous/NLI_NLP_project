  for a long time it was zin\u00e9dine zidane too . 
  i still think that griezmann by playing football is much more popular than riner . 
  it 's undoubtedly antoine griezmann https://twitter.com/antogriezmann/status/764890541028995073/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.programme-tv.net%2fnews%2fsport%2ffootball%2f91977-sondage-antoine-griezmann-sportif-prefere-des-francais-selon-le-jdd%2f, 
  unfair discrimination is apt . 
  it is a breach of consumer law in most european countries . 
  yeah , kind of . 
  it 's a thing americans say mind you . 
  it 's from an american book dating back to the 20 's according to wikipedia , written in `` phonetics '' voulay vous couchay aveck moy ? '' . 
  the spice girls thing came much later . 
  you 'd use `` vous '' with a stranger or in a formal setting so the sentence is perfectly correct . 
  it 's something a prostitute could say in the 20 's i guess . 
  un am\u00e9ricain is a belgian-originated sandwich with just a baguette , ground beef , some mayo , and some fries in it . 
  really thin and short fries . 
  french vanilla could be vanilla from madascagar or some french islands/former colonies . 
  i 'm late to the party , but it has to be charles xi , it ca n't be anyone else for france . 
  the king was going batshit crazy targaryan style and the english pigdogs convinced him to sell off his crown ( that was n't really his to give away ) to the english king and his daughter ( that somehow was his to give away ) . 
  also some people were burnt alive in a bal . 
  but that was before . 
  the british only accepted to say `` yeah that whole treaty of troyes '' thing was silly in 1802 , so 4 centuries later . 
  `` my god , please i beg of you , open the count 's eyes , or rather shut them down ! '', 
  ( if he had died , his heir would have accepted the tricolor flag ) . 
  henri d'artois , heir of the crown of france , should have been king in 1871 after the defeat of napol\u00e9on iii . 
  one of his conditions , and he was very adamant about it , was to restore the monarchist white flag . 
  it was not realistic . 
  years later , the republicans started winning elections , and the republic , which at first was meant to be temporary , became very permanent . 
  and all that because henri d'artois was too proud to accept the tricolor flag and did n't back down for years . 
  the marshall franchet d'esp\u00e8rey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-jy-yih4ro, 
  france 's race is fascinating , but i 'd be careful calling macron a winner just yet . 
  three months ago , nobody expected him to be where he is right now and fillon was a certain winner . 
  the two main parties are collapsing due to infighting and scandals which are the brand of the `` old system '' while new players emerge . 
  if there is a second turn involving neither lr or the ps , which are the two main parties of the french political system , this is a political earthquake . 
  even if fillon and hamon seem both too far behind to catch up with macron right now , the latter is not safe from a turn around due to a scandal . 
  right now , it seems unlikely that the 4th political force in this election led by m\u00e9lenchon will rally to the strong left candidate that is hamon in an alliance to win it all . 
  m\u00e9lenchon has very strong ideas , and sees himself as a revolutionary and a communist and does n't believe in hamon 's capacity to carry adequately his program , despite the fact that their respective partisans would welcome an alliance . 
  a second turn will most likely involve marine le pen and the future winner of the election . 
  there is no way she wins the second turn against macron , fillon , or hamon . 
  she has currently close to 0 % chance of being elected . 
  bosnia . 
  so stylish . 
  croatia comes a close second . 
  it was controversial at the time . 
  he argued while he was alive ( died after the 4 first statues were completed ) that it was n't about their morals , but rather their undeniable impact on the xxth century history . 
  georges fr\u00eache ( the mayor ) was also a university professor in history . 
  yep . 
  i included some people with dual nationality . 
  there is also lafayette who had been made an american citizen in 1784 . 
  yep . 
  a lot . 
  paris is i believe the city outside of the us with the most streets named after us presidents : washington , wilson , franklin , lincoln , roosevelt , there is a thomas jefferson square , a kennedy quay . 
  there 's also george gershwin ( american musician ) , josephine baker , thomas edison , hemingway , and mumia abu jamal ( black panther activist ) . 
  `` winston churchill '' is also a popular street name . 
  i 've seen some . 
  top 100 of the most popular street names throughout france , there are a few foreign ones , from bottom to top : ludwig von beethoven , pablo neruda , nelson mandela , johanes guttenberg , martin luther king , l\u00e9onard de vinci , vincent von gogh , pablo picasso , salvador allende , mozart , pierre et marie curie ( i guess they are polish too ) . 
  http://www.slate.fr/sites/default/files/photos/palm_10c.png in my hometown montpellier , there is a controversial building that was made by a megalomaniac ( and now deceased ) mayor , named `` place des grand hommes '' or `` great men plaza '' with statues of xxth century important figures : * winston churchill * mohandas gandhi * charles de gaulle * jean jaur\u00e8s * l\u00e9nine * mao zedong * golda meir * nelson mandela * gamal abdel nasser * franklin delano roosevelt, 
  totally , that 's why channels like eurosport ca n't afford to get the champion 's league or the top european football leagues / top 14 . 
  so they try to get a niche of viewers with other content , ranging from skiing competition to biathlon while other channels like l'\u00e9quipe go as far as broadcasting professional p\u00e9tanque tournaments . 
  i think eurosport is free and the sports they broadcast are much more varied . 
  bein gets the premium content along with canal + and they are both paying . 
  yeah , small mistake obviously x ) . 
  it 's because in my head i always picture napol\u00e9on as a rather young man in his 30 's / 40 's and napol\u00e9on iii as an older man . 
  i think so too but you have to remember that algeria saw the widespread use of torture , napalm ( before the americans even ) , and terrorism . 
  it was a very nasty war . 
  it was a french civil war ( de gaulle v. oas ) , an algerian civil war ( different groups on the algerian side fought each others ) , and a war between france ( and the pro-france algerian fighters ) and the algerian independentists . 
  during the war and particularly the battle of algers ( 1957 ) , the term `` bigeard shrimp '' ( fr : crevette bigeard ) was coined . 
  it was a form of execution consisting in putting the feet of a prisoner in concrete and dropping them from a plane to their inevitable death into the mediterranean sea . 
  he personally says he was n't part of it , but he also admits it was no secret that torture was widespread , especially `` la g\u00e9g\u00e8ne '' which is slang for the use of an electrical generator as a mean of torture through the use of electrods on various body parts . 
  i do n't think it was the most efficient interrogation technique , but civilian murders and terrorism both in metropolitan france and algeria was widespread and the army was sometimes desperate to get informations about the location of bombs about to explode . 
  edit : he wrote a book titled `` le manuel de l'officier de renseignement '' ( the manual of the intelligence officer ) describing torture , including the `` g\u00e9g\u00e8ne '' . 
  the book was widespread and the techniques were later used by augusto pinochet , saddam hussein , and the united states . 
  * the colonel bigeard ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcel_bigeard ) . 
  a war hero , but maybe for the wrong ones . 
  he symbolizes the empire that came after the republic and before the monarchy ( again ) . 
  as a symbol of such , his legacy has n't always been seen in the brigtest light by the subsequent regimes , although i think he 's the greatest french historical figure , some see him as a warmongering dictator and nothing more . 
  that being said , even if the `` republican school '' paints him as a dictator , he 's still france 's most liked historical figure . 
  liberator of the nation from the yolk of the monarchy or instigator of the great terror and murderer of hundreds of thousands ... maybe both ? 
  revered by the extreme left , not so much by the conservatives . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maximilien_robespierre * napol\u00e9on iii , emperor of the french . 
  although less succesful than his uncle * napol\u00e9on 1er ; napol\u00e9on iii made france a great power that could almost rival great britain . 
  he brought about the modernization of the agricutural sector and the economy and was about to modernize the military , but his many blunders when it came to foreign policy , which ultimately led to his demise ( invasion of mexico , crimea , and of course prussian invasion of 1870 ) at the hands of the prussian tarnished his legacy and he 's seen as a failure by most people , it does n't help that he antagonized a part of the french elite , including victor hugo . 
  * jules ferry : on one side he 's a very popular figure who proclaimed that education should be free for all and mandatory and free from the influence of the church ( birth of french laicity ) , on the other side he was a proponent of french colonial expansion . 
  edit : * louis-ferdinand c\u00e9line comes to mind aswell . 
  one of france 's brightest author . 
  `` journey to the end of the night '' ( 1932 ) is a modern masterpiece that has redefined french and global litterature . 
  problem is that he also became a nazi sympathizer later on and fervent antisemite during ww2 . 
  he was so antisemitic that even the nazis thought he was overdoing it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis-ferdinand_c%c3%a9line . 
  what are they about ? 
  i ca n't read german . 
  some people have decent english skills but are too afraid to speak because they are very self-conscious about their accent . 
   why do so many in other countries find it so fascinating that we do this ? 
  i do n't know about france but it 's not fascinating . 
  french people love butter . 
  our staple sandwich , the basic one , is `` jambon-beurre '' ( ham + butter ) . 
  our sandwiches are made of baguettes though , so it 's different . 
  baguettes slices + butter is also a very popular morning combo , sometimes you add marmelade on top and you dip it into your milk . 
  mustards and mayonnaise are wildly used too . 
  mayonnaise with chicken and/or tuna usually ( see pan bagnat , a mediterranean popular sandwich ) . 
  mustard is more restricted to hot sandwiches while mayonnaise is for cold ones . 
  wow , impressive job . 
  france has bourbon and bonapartists heirs alive today .
