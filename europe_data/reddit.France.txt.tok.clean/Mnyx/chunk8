  it 's the aftermath that was n't handled properly . 
  i 'm not sure what could have been done to make a transition to a stable regime successful . 
  someone should get fired over that title . 
  it is because ch\u00e2teau , in french , means both regular medieval fortresses , and renaissance style nobility palaces . 
  for medieval castles : castle of foix ( xiith ) http://imgur.com/n3xgnrh castle of bonaguil the last medieval fortress built in the kingdom ( xvth ) http://imgur.com/t7jg4wb the medieval city of carcassonne ( xith ) http://imgur.com/upnbpqo for a got-vibe , the fortified bridge of valentr\u00e9 , also named bridge of the devil ( xivth ) http://imgur.com/c75oq9h the castle of foug\u00e8res ( xii ) http://imgur.com/ccw8yzh, 
  yep . 
  can confirm . 
  you would like to think so , but old people vote massively for the ump , not the fn . 
  one i particularly like is [ guerre , guerre , vente vent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i_vqhbmmay ) written for the 7 years war i believe . 
  i prefer [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqdxbh4zuem ) of the chant du d\u00e9part , it 's a bit more bloody and borderline crazy but that 's why it 's nice after all . 
  edit : forgot about le r\u00eave passe ( [ the dream passes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19v7tmfbmdc&amp; ) ) and [ vous n'aurez jamais l'alsace et la lorraine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3a4kol4yo ) ( you 'll never get ( to keep ) alsace and lorraine ) . 
  i insist . 
  title of the thread is different than the title of the document . 
  what is really meant is that 16 % of spaniards who do not have castillan as a native language consider themselves able to hold a conversation in castillan . 
  and you 're the one saying `` turkey is not european because it 's not european '' ... definitions of europe 's geography and cultures are varied and yours is n't the only one . 
  as a european country turkey also defines what is european . 
  not in the same that america is part of europe 's history . 
  not in the slightest . 
  the seljuks brought down the byzantine empire and the ottomans conquered greece , the balkans , and a good chunk of eastern europe . 
  i 'm not being inclusive , just stating the obvious that not only did the turks left a mark on those countries , they also have land on the other side of the bosphorus . 
  they are part of the eufa and the echr ... what i say is , let 's not try to label turkey as `` european '' or `` not european '' just because we want to label it , i do n't want to be inclusive , i 'm just saying it 's a special case and people should n't approach this with a black or white mentality . 
  could n't agree more . 
  but turkey is part of europe 's history , and have influenced it so much that to me it is part of europe . 
  it 's a gateway between europe and the east , it 's a bit of both , no need to put things in boxes they do n't fit in , but we ca n't deny centuries of history and cultural exchanges . 
  all the regions have flags though . 
  and more so than the basque , the bretons are guilty of taking their flags everywhere . 
  it 's a bit stupid imho and i fully agree with the eurovision policy . 
  it belongs to algeria though . 
  most of the sahara does . 
  who is they ? 
  shareholders ? 
  the company ? 
  the money is put in bank accounts or reinvested , but it 's taxed way less than it would be in a country that is not luxembourg or ireland . 
  it 's completely artificial here . 
  a company will make billions of profits in france or any other regular country , and then they will pay a maximum of money through shady deals like `` licensing ' or `` administrative fees '' to a company that is hardly more than an empty shell in luxembourg ( a non-country as far as i 'm concerned ) or ireland . 
  france is a fiscal paradise ... when you 're not making any profit . 
  your argument makes sense , but i do n't see it translated often in everyday life . 
  people have their habits and they seldomly change them , so companies take advantage of that . 
  whether on one side or the other of the border . 
  nah , you 're totally wrong . 
  it 's a load of bullcrap even . 
  people cross borders all the time to get products that are less expensive abroad ( video games in the uk , cigarettes in andorra , oil in luxembourg , chocolates in belgium ... ) . 
  the eu forbids country to create barriers to the free movement of goods , but prices are obviously free . 
  in this case we 're talking about protectionism between member states . 
  i do n't think it 's a good idea . 
  but if we 're talking about the european union as a whole , i do n't see nothing bad with a small dose of protectionism . 
  i did think it was personal . 
  i misread it . 
  i apologize . 
  fuck you . 
  you think i agree with what the farmers did ? 
  of course i do n't . 
  and i 'm not a protectionnist . 
  i did n't voice any opinion one way or the other so i do n't know how you get that i 'm a protectionist and/or a nationalist . 
  i 'm just saying that summoning an ambassador for a truck of wine is futile . 
  in the first case i linked , france was condemned because of the passivity of the policemen . 
  it was more or less the same thing , except with strawberries instead of wine . 
  so , if as you say , the farmers that did it remain anonymous , the policemen will still be held accountable . 
  there are big problems going on in france with the farmers . 
  the ambassador can do nothing about that . 
  also people do n't go to jail for vandalism . 
  but there is no reason to think that the guilty parties wont be punished . 
  last time it happened the french governement payed a hefty fine to the eu authorities , and it 's going to be the case again . 
  both parties know that . 
  summoning the ambassador is just posturing .

  islamic terrorism is political . 
  organized theft , organ trafficking , child prostitution , arm trafficking , scamming , begging and pick-pocketting are not . 
  he 's just pointing out it 's offending , and he 's right . 
  i do n't know anything about spain army industry . 
  what do they build / export ? 
  left neighbor : handicapped . 
  he 's depressed since his son died in a car crash , and his wife has a mental condition of some sort , she feels persecuted . 
  sometimes he yells at the arabs down the block from his window , calls them dirty sandniggers for no reason , or for very little reason . 
  he pissed everyone off to get the town to give him a special parking spot ( i mean , he had a spot , but there was no handicap sign on it , and the painting was n't clear ) , and he never uses it . 
  one time when i was tween he threatened to kill my dog and pulled out a hunting rifle in front of my house , i told him i would bludgeon him to death with the pan i had in my hand if he touched my golden . 
  meanwhile my mom was yelling hysterically and calling the cops and the dog could n't stop barking . 
  i 'm not talking to them . 
  right neighbors are new people . 
  a young couple . 
  they are big fans of the local soccer club , and the husband recently bought a new set of drums , but it 's fine , i do n't mind the noise . 
  i wave at them every time i see them . 
  so i guess the local governement does n't do much to improve neighbourliness , neither do the neighbors . 
  it 's a small town though , everyone say hi to everyone . 
  also , every month , there is a magazine about the town that is printed by a group of locals , and distributed for free to everyone . 
  during summer , there are free sport initiations for everyone at the communal stadium too . 
  i 've only got basic knowledge of french and european consumer law , which have basically the same fundamentals , but eula are not binding , by any stretch of the imagination . 
  you can find dozen of abusive clauses in them which render them void . 
  ear *, 
  in `` id\u00e9e '' , the sound is the same as the letter `` e '' in english , so yeah , like in indiana . 
  `` imp\u00f4t / imprimer '' all those in/im sounds only sound like `` an '' to your ear because you 're not used to them . 
  but to a native ear , `` an '' and `` in/im/ain / ein '' are very different . 
  if you have two `` m ' generally , you say `` i '' like `` e '' ( immolation , immobilier ... ) . 
  can you enlighten me though ? 
  you should ask for an `` amburger '' . 
  if you pronounce the h like in english you 're doing it wrong , we do not have that sound in french , it 's really hard for us to pronounce the english h for that reason and that would seem very alien . 
  think of how we say hambourg , that ham part with the burger you know . 
  the h in france is silent but you notice it when you do n't do the liaison with the previous word . 
  about accents , you 're wrong , they do change the spelling . 
  and i that become a at the start of words ...
