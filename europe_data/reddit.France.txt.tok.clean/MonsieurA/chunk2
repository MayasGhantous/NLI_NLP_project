  well , a lot of people only voted for him simply because he was the default `` not sarkozy '' choice . 
  the socialist party did n't really have time to present any better alternative after the [ whole dsk scandal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominique_strauss-kahn#new_york_v._strauss-kahn_and_later_allegations ) so his ` legitimacy ' to power was already tenuous in 2012 . 
  the burden was really on him to prove his worth . 
  unfortunately , he lacks charisma and any sort of coherent political direction . 
  u-turns and half-measures are abound . 
  he does n't really inspire confidence . 
  when he does promise optimistic predictions , most of us can only laugh , as it 's proven wrong time and time again . 
  that much is what most of french people can agree on . 
  so you 'll find extreme discontent on all sides of the political aisle . 
  however , you 'll also find that we still disagree on what the * actual * policy direction * should * be . 
  if the economy does turn around in the upcoming months or years , maybe those on the left will be able to forgive his ` personality ' flaws .

  well , if we 're going off the ` traditional ' theory of conservatism , they mostly strive for stability . 
  drastic changes are rarely seen as useful , as they could - potentially - lead to instability . 
  here , instability is often seen as the motor of violence and a ` deteriorated ' society . 
  gradualism is preferred . 
  thus , you get policies such as limited immigration ( to `` ensure social cohesion '' ) , social conservatism ( to ensure the maintenance of `` traditional values '' ) and ` austere ' budgets ( to ensure `` budgetary security '' ) . 
  i 'm not saying i agree with it . 
  in fact , i tend to disagree with the evidence they try presenting . 
  however , it is possible to empathize where they 're coming from . 
  well , those journalists [ are n't going to fire themselves ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/2101261/french-tv-turmoil-as-sarkozys-glamorous-blonde-takes-limelight.html ) !,

  would you say the president is a more important figure than the prime minister in these countries ? 
  depends on your political orientation . 
  the comparisons are mostly about their personality types ( very ambitious and good orators ) and their rhetoric regarding immigration . 
  however , i fear some are placing too much importance on style over substance . 
  we 'll see how his policies and governance style play out . 
  personally , i was n't too fond of sarkozy .

  psg supporters had been a bit too cocky ahead of the game and thought it was already won . 
   why ? 
  i think their whole ~ ~ divorce ~ ~ separation and hollande 's recent love affair might be just a tiny elephant in the room ...
