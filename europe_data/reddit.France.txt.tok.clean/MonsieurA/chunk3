   we are voting for our mayor . 
  the russian aligned far-right party fn is expected to make moderate progress and gain the mayorship of some cities . 
  and , for those curious , that second ( final ) round is today . 
  i wonder if the wider reddit community will react to the inevitable fn victories . 
  it should be interesting to see all these hidden `` france experts '' come out of the woodworks . 
  edit : latest results show the fn as having won 12 cities . 
  out of 36,000 . 
  ** france ** : * our parliament is acting like a bunch of children . 
  [ the center-right opposition ( ump ) refused to attend the weekly `` questions to government '' session ] ( http://pneumaticdetach.com/right-sulking-the-last-session-of-questions-to-the-government/ ) after the minister of the interior , manuel valls , called out a ump mp for previously belonging the `` far-right . '',

  no one is surprised anymore . 
  * the `` big news '' that 's come out recently is an alleged `` new political scandal . '', 
  [ opposition ( ump ) leader , jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 allegedly engaged in cronyism , overpaying two of his buddies to help organize events ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20140227-french-opposition-leader-cope-scandal/ ) . 
  costs , apparently , went up to ** 8 million $ . 
  ** all the while he begged party members to *** donate *** up to ** 11 million $ ** . 
  * sarkozy makes his regular so-called `` post card '' visit to the news , making his [ first major speech since losing in 2012 . 
  ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/slight-hollande-berlin-fetes-sarkozy-161840985.html ) he 's making it extremely obvious he wants to break his election promise and run again in 2017 . 
  * [ a poll is released ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lefigaro.fr%2factualite-france%2f2014%2f02%2f26%2f01016-20140226artfig00113-meprises-les-18-25-ans-songent-a-la-revolte.php ) showing that most of the youth is pessimistic about their future . 
  68 % say they 'd be willing to participate in a `` mai 68 '' type of mass protest . 
  * parliament votes to [ `` indefinitely extend '' french presence in the central african republic ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702304834704579405261927493246?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fsb10001424052702304834704579405261927493246.html ) . 
  hollande visited it this week , vowing that he would not allow it to separate into two countries . 
  * apparently [ france has a diplomatic row going on with morocco ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/27/us-morocco-france-idusbrea1q0gw20140227 ) . 
  i have n't heard too much about it in the french media though . 
  * oh , and there were the [ * c\u00e9sars * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/39th_c%c3%a9sar_awards ) , the french equivalent to the oscars . 
  [ this movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmdd-mgpp3u ) won a lot of awards . 
  what shocked me more was this revealing bit :  unfortunately - [ *** although i would love to be in that position *** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=v4otdenmod8#t=865 ) - the president of the united states is not emperor of the world . 
  it made me cringe as much as [ bush 's little insight ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8221-if-this-were-a-dictatorship-it-would-be-a-heck ) . 
  ** france ** : * a lot of the focus has been on mandela . 
  sarkozy and hollande both attended the ceremony , but they ` controversially ' used different planes to get there . 
  * also a main focus of our news has been our intervention in the central african republic . 
  the first deaths of french soldiers occurred on tuesday . 
  popular support for the intervention is already starting to decrease . 
  some voices have already pointed out that hollande is `` neoconservative '' in his willingness to use military intervention . 
  * the government received a report on `` integration '' in french society ( a big ` hot-button issue ' in france ) . 
  the report controversially suggests the return of niqabs in schools , the teaching of arabic in class , and the possibility to learn african languages in primary school . 
  * sarkozy pretty much seems to confirm he will return in 2017 , arguing that he has `` no choice '' but to return . 
  some have mocked him for his ` messianic ' style of speaking . 
  * president hollande visits brazil . 
  apparently he failed to convince rousseff to buy french fighter jets . 
  * also , some coverage has been given to the time 's most influential people of 2013 list . 
  some have laughed at the fact that hollande is pretty low in the list . 
  dubious in it 's classiness is what i meant . 
  they should have known better than to use those words . 
  ( although they were , of course , doing it for publicity . ), 
  `` retrouver la banane '' is not meant to be taken literally , by the way . 
  it 's an expression that means she `` smiling again '' or in a good mood . 
   plenty of people are still stuck with prehistoric adsl [ you called ? 
  ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3063165839.png ), 
  ah , ok , i was n't perfectly clear on the story . 
  ** france ** * hollande is heckled by far-right protestors at his wwi commemoration speech . 
  le pen denounces the `` totalitarian methods '' that were used to `` repress protests . '', 
  * a far-right newspaper , that most of us had forgotten even existed , publishes a cover , with a [ dubious word play regarding bananas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5hcag1e.jpg ) . 
  * martine aubry , hollande 's former competitor at the socialist primaries , has a rare meeting with hollande . 
  there are rumors she may become the next prime minister . 
  a new poll shows 67 % of french want a new pm . 
  * le pen and the netherlands ' geert wilders create a new euroskeptic party within the european parliament . 
  from what i heard , both ukip and the swedish democrats have refused to be associated with them . 
  * gdp growth numbers are in for q3 . 
  -0.1 % ... just what we needed to hear ... * and , to keep our mood up , france loses against ukraine 2-0 in the qualification match for the 2014 wc . 
  ~ ~ people are already saying it 's unlikely we 'll beat ukraine in the 2nd leg . 
  so , in other words , no world cup for france . ~ ~ [ what the fuck happened . 
  jesus christ on a pogo stick . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24907601 ) * the eu commission has validated the french budget for 2014 , but warns that france has `` little room for manouver . '', 
  * hollande reaches record low popularity , being the least popular president since * 1958 * . 
  * hollande is visiting israel today . 
  some people i have spoken to have said they do n't quite like this * rapprochement * with israel . 
  * and , finally , some good news : a french hostage has ~ ~ been released ~ ~ escaped captivity in nigeria after a year . 
  ** france ** nothing too exciting this week ... * protestors in brittany still not happy despite the fact that hollande cancelled his eco-tax plans . 
  57 % of french now think the protestors are going too far . 
  * s&p downgraded us . 
  in a rare moment of unity , the french agree that we all hate credit agencies anyways . 
  * two centrist parties have united to create a new , unified centrist party ( called `` alternative '' ) . 
  people do n't take it very seriously , as its two leaders are not exactly charismatic . 
  * a new documentary on sarkozy is released by one of carla bruni 's friends . 
  it 's criticized for being a white-washed , polished version of sarkozy . 
  ( * les guignols * , a political satire show , pretty much [ summarizes it ] ( http://www.canalplus.fr/c-divertissement/pid1784-c-les-guignols.html?vid=966340 ) 5 minutes in . ), 
  * continued debate over racism in french society after an fn protestor 's 10-year-old daughter was caught calling justice minister taubira a monkey . 
  i guess to add what they emphasized in ** wallonia ** : * bart de wever 's ( flemish nationalist ) program has been getting * a lot * of coverage . 
  media accuses of it being a further step towards separatism and use the usual hyperbole . 
  a lot of them have mocked the suggestion that the position of prime minister be removed . 
  * germany 's *** die welt *** has criticized belgium for its high debt and low investment in r&d . some childishly use the occasion to deflect criticism and point out germany 's flaws . 
  * afghans protested in front of immigration minister de block and pm di rupo 's offices , demanding asylum reform . 
  * justice minister turtelboom has proposed reforms to prevent overcrowded prisons , emphasizing the use of electric bracelets . 
  and , in the artificial , overblown outrage section : * brussels has started to paint street posts blue and yellow to `` strengthen the brussels identity . '', 
  some have criticized the shade of blue used as being too dark and ressembling **** gasp **** the ** flemish colors ** ( black and yellow ) !, 
  ** waterloo , belgium ** i still live with the parents , but here 's what we 've got with the `` belgacom maxi '' pack . 
  * ** cost ** : $ 46,20 / month * ** maximum download ** : 21 mbps * ** maximum upload ** : 2 mbps if i do a speed test , i notice [ my results show ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3063165839.png ) that my family is getting severely ripped off ( with a nice little `` f '' grade ) : * ** actual download ** : 3,86 mbps ( no download limit though ) * ** actual upload ** : 0,41 mb/s * ** ping ** : 27 ms i 've briefly spoken with my father to find an alternative , but i would n't even know where to begin looking . 
  ** edit : ** and to address your questions ** how is the consistency ? 
  ** good ? 
  the speed remains constant . 
  although it will randomly shut down sometimes . 
  ** how were the internet connections at your university ? 
  ** decent . 
  slightly slower than what i get at home . 
  ** are there complaints about your government not taking the initiative to improve the infrastructure ? 
  ** i think we all acknowledge it 's terrible . 
  but most people i talk to seem to be apathetic about it . 
  ** what are some good things that comes with your internet only available for your area ( for example internet voting ) ? 
  ** with all the talk about `` download caps '' on reddit 's frontpage , i guess i can be happy that belgium is moving * away * from that model . 
  ah ok , thanks for the clarification .
