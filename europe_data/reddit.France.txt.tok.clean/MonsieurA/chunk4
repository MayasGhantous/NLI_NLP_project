  i suspect you 're referring to [ gary mckinnon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gary_mckinnon ) ? 
  from my personal perspective , not much . 
  from cop\u00e9 's electoral perspective , i suspect he thinks it 'll win him voters who dislike immigration . 
  ( [ according to the incessant polls ] ( http://euobserver.com/political/121838 ) , this is apparently a rising constituency in france . ), 
  has farage ( or ukip in general ) come out in favor of the nsa spying ? 
  i know they describe themselves as a ` libertarian ' party , but i guess that would just be a further inconsistency in that regard . 
  i suppose that 's a semantics question . 
  it depends what criteria you look at to determine what constitutes ` centrist ' or ` right-wing . ', 
  similarly , in the us , they see hollande as far-left , while in france he 's considered a wishy washy social democrat . 
  ** france ** i 've been a bit busy this week , so i have n't been following the news as closely as i usually do , but from what i picked up on ... * surprise , surprise , the nsa is spying on us too !, 
  we all expect a [ very firm response from hollande ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uipsviz9nds&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=39 ) . 
  * center-right ump party leader , cop\u00e9 , has said he 's against automatic citizenship for children born in france . 
  ( pretty easy to read between the lines here : he does n't want `` dem dirty ay-rabs and gyps '' becoming french because they 're born in france . ), 
  * titan ceo maurice taylor , who infamously called french workers `` lazy , '' now does a u-turn and offers to buy the goodyear factory in amiens ( northern france ) . 
  * september 's unemployment numbers are in . 
  unemployment is back on the rise in france . 
  no one is surprised anymore . 
  * farmers in britanny are rioting over a new `` ecotax . '', 
  speaking of baikonur , former french pm de villepin ( the `` france must not intervene in iraq '' dude ) has a daughter who 's starring in a new movie . . about baikonur . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhdtqhglobw only trailer i could find was with swedish subtitles . 
  you completely badhoff-meinhoff 'd me with your comment though . 
  literally * just * learned about baikonur because of that movie . 
  oh , it 's definitely been a huge news story in france . 
  in fact , i forgot to mention that there have been some very mediatized student protests about it . 
  and hollande has said that leonarda could return to france ... without her family . 
  it 's just that the media also juggles with other current events to keep it a bit less monotonous . 
  so we 've also been hearing a lot about brignoles , marseille and brittany this past week . 
  well , officially , they 've never been an explicitly racist party . 
  they 're just our main far-right party , so comedians ( and the media ) like to conflate them with nazis . 
  ( and , fact of the matter is , if you 're a neo-nazi , you 're probably going to be voting fn . ), 
  the reason they 're classified as far-right is because they want to severely limit immigration and they constantly rant about islam . 
  economically speaking , they 're populists and so , they 've pretty much adapted to the ` anti-conformist , ' anti-capitalist rhetoric . 
  ( disregarding the fact they were a staunch reaganite/thatcherite party in the 80s . ), 
  so , in that regard , they 're on the ` left . ', 
  some comedians have made the easy joke that they 're `` national socialists . '', 
  guess i 'll help contribute this week . 
  * s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royale ( former center-left presidential candidate in france ) is mocked for sending a letter to pm di rupo , suggesting that hazing be made illegal in colleges . 
  * football commentator says that belgian singer [ stromae ( who gave a half-time performance ) ] ( http://static1.7sur7.be/static/photo/2013/14/9/9/20131016104203/media_l_6202374.jpg ) is an example of a `` colored boy '' who 's `` integrated well . '', 
  the media no likey this comment . 
  * minister of health onkelinx has presented a new ` anti-hiv ' reform . 
  she basically just wants to spend more on it . 
  * pm di rupo presents his successes and future proposals in what 's called a `` declaration of general policy '' speech . 
  he repeats that he 's found the ` belgian model ' to get out of the crisis : a mixture of social reforms and cuts . 
  he promises no increase in the vat , increased salaries for 1.4 million workers , reduced energy bills , bank reform and lower taxes for small businesses . 
  * the senate 's justice commission discusses euthanasia for minors * flemish nationalist party n-va is bitching about princess astrid leading economic missions . 
  * ocde has criticized belgium for its lack of involvement in transnational corruption * un 's committee on human rights looks at the famous black peter character to see whether or not it 's `` racist '', 
  ** france ** * [ extreme-right fn wins a by-election in brignoles ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/07/us-france-farright-idusbre99609w20131007 ) . 
  the media makes a big deal out of it , but political analysts remind people that : ( 1 ) it 's an area that tends to vote far-right , ( 2 ) fn wo n't really have much power ( one comedian joked : `` what are they gon na do , rebuild a roundabout in the form of a swastika ? 
  '' ) , ( 3 ) one city \u2260 the national level . 
  * socialist primary for the marseille mayoral electoral . 
  marseille is one of our biggest ( and most corrupt and violent ) cities , so it 's a pretty big deal . 
  the two candidates have been a bit ruthless , one calling the other '' [ parisian ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/politique/1237287-20131016-primaire-ps-a-marseille-premier-debat-houleux-entre-deux-finalistes ) '' ( **** gasp **** ) or `` the media 's candidate . '', 
  * strikes in brittany over the decline of the local food-processing industry . 
  [ this lady ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zikmobohn0s ) becomes our mini-celebrity of the week , yelling about how both parties `` have n't done shit '' to solve the problem and , instead , are primarily concerned about partisan bickering . 
  * 15-year-old roma girl , leonarda dibrani , is taken away by cops during a field trip and expelled from france with her family . 
  this creates a lot of tensions within different political groups . 
  some accuse our interior minister valls of being `` no better than sarkozy . '', 
  apparently , he secretly offered to resign over this . 
  yet , [ 65 % of french agrees she was rightfully expelled ] ( http://www.bfmtv.com/politique/65pour-cent-francais-opposes-retour-leonarda-627098.html ) ... * center-right ump had a conference to look over sarkozy 's mandate and point out his accomplishments . 
  apparently , they struggled to find any ... * lower house of parliament votes in favor of the famous `` 75 % tax . '', 
  our rich football players have notably spoken out against it . 
  * an fn member , sophie leclere , has [ compared our [ black ] justice minister to a monkey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrtm6v3.jpg ) . 
  that 's a huge no-no in france . 
  she 's been expelled from her party . 
  * france wins against finland 3-0 !, 
  [ we 're back , baby !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bv0hcjh.gif ) ^ but ^ we ^ still ^ hate ^ the ^ players ^ on ^ the ^ team . 
  ^ and ^ we 're ^ not ^ qualified ^ yet . 
  in my honest opinion , he is . 
  he pretty much [ rigged the primary election ] ( http://lajeunepolitique.com/2013/01/11/ump-to-implement-agreement-party-left-with-tarnished-reputation/ ) to become head of the ump party . 
  and he 's very quick to give in to populism when it 's convenient . 
  for example , he famously gave in to the growing anti-islamic sentiments in france , saying that muslims [ intimidate kids that want to eat their chocolate bread ] ( http://ontd-political.livejournal.com/10150867.html ) during ramadan and that there 's growing [ `` anti-white '' racism in france ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20120927-right-wing-leader-claims-anti-white-racism-growing-france ) . 
  he 's also flip-flopped on gay marriage purely for electoral reasons and called for random drug inspections in * schools * . 
  not my type of politician , although - unfortunately - some people in france seem to be fond of those positions . 
  here 's the summarized version of the conversation :  ** lady ** : hi , i 'm a single mother raising three kids . 
  i wake up at 6 am every morning and volunteer for charity ( [ restos du coeur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/restaurants_du_c%c5%93ur ) and [ bouchon d'amour ] ( http://www.bouchonsdamour.com/ ) ) . 
  i 've tried to find a job , but there are * no * jobs left in alsace . 
  alsace has been completely deindustrialized . 
  we need policies that are more humane and less about cold-hearted monetary concerns . 
   ** cop\u00e9 ** : i feel your pain --  ** l ** : no , you do n't . 
  you do n't know what it 's like to live on 470 $ per month . 
  if you truly want to feel my family 's pain , go work with my son at a peugeot factory for a week . 
  then you can see how reasonable it is to ask him to work until he 's 63 . 
   ** c ** : yes , i am the mayor of meaux , and many inhabitants have spoken to me of similar concerns --  ** l ** : it 's my turn to talk now . 
   [ * audience laughs * ]  ** c ** : [ * in a half-mocking tone * ] i can understand where your anger is coming from . 
  i suspect having to travel here from mulhouse does n't help . 
   * personal comment : cop\u00e9 , as always , showing he 's a classy man of the people *  ** c ** : we need to look at the root of the problem . 
  the employment system in france is a mess . 
  people can not find stable , secure jobs and have to jump from one contract to the next . 
  the prices on products are too high , meaning that the french have low purchasing power . 
   in order to fix this , we need to decrease taxes and other burdens on businesses . 
  as of now , they are afraid to hire people . 
  if we facilitate the hiring process , there will be more jobs available . 
   [ * lady shakes her head in disagreement * ]  ** c ** : [ * in a frustrated tone * ] you 're so angry you 're not even willing to listen to me anymore . 
   ** l ** : it 's all words , but no action . 
  we need politicians that know what it feels like to live on 470 $ per month . 
  i do n't care about parties . 
  i would vote for a politician that knows what it 's like to wake up at 6 am every morning to take public transportation to work a minimum wage job . 
   mr cop\u00e9 , why do you want to take away from people that * already * have * nothing * ? 
  for the past 40 years , nothing 's been getting better in this country .
