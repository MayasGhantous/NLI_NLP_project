   [ * cop\u00e9 sports an uncomfortable grin on his face * ]  ** presenter ** : just to clarify , cop\u00e9 believes that by diminishing unemployment benefits , it will incentivize people to find a job . 
   ** l ** : how are you meant to find a job when there are * no * jobs ? 
   to argue that we need to reform our benefit system is nonsense . 
  it is self-funded : those that are employed pay for the unemployed , and families pay for their own family benefits . 
   ** presenter ** : so , mr. cop\u00e9 , can you tell her why we should believe you now , when you 've already been in power ? 
   ** c ** : [ * irritated * ] yes , i 'm not deaf , i 've heard both of you ask me that already . 
  however , the only alternatives are hollande , who is suffocating france , and the far-right , who have suicidal economic policies . 
   we , at ump , are willing to take courageous and humane decisions . 
  again , this is a slightly summarized version ( without * every * single detail ) , and i 've not tried transcribing it word-for-word . 
  but it 's pretty much what i understood in the debate . 
  it basically means he had 9 different cabinets . 
  belgium in the 1980s was a bit chaotic . 
  haha , wow , complete typo on my part . 
  i * did * watch it . 
  going to fix that . 
  ** france ** * french court drops charges against sarkozy 's illegal campaign financing . 
  people think this will give sarkozy further incentive to run again in 2017 . 
  * the `` civil war '' amongst the center-right ump party continues , as former pm fillon claims he 'd be better suited to run the country than sarkozy . 
  * interior minister valls announces the creation of a new `` zone de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 prioritaire '' in forbach ( aka : sending more cops there ) , to try and stop the rise of the far-right fn there . 
  * french movie director patrice ch\u00e9reau dies . 
  * [ an mp from the center-right ump `` clucks '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6f5timtob0 ) while a female green party mp is speaking . 
  once again , the media has a field day with this , claiming it to be a sign of `` unacceptable sexism amongst politicians . '', 
  * famous french actor alain delon has come out in favor of the far-right fn party . 
  * a new poll shows fn is expected to win in the 2014 eu parliament elections in france . 
  * center-right ump party leader jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 goes on a political tv show and is questioned by an unemployed women . 
  [ she showed raw emotion and a great ability to articulate her anger ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh8ptlmt9v0 ) . 
  she 's become a sort of `` mini-celebrity '' this week . 
  * france wins against ~ ~ austria ~ ~ australia 6-0 in the 2014 qualifiers . 
  [ yeah , bitch . 
  yeah , it felt like a pretty slow news week to me . 
  they were mostly just dragging out last week 's controversies . 
  other things that were touched upon this week in the news : * our unemployment numbers were accidentally rigged . 
  in fact , the drop in unemployment numbers was not * 50,000 , * [ but * 22,000-29 ,000 * ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20130930-france-unemployment-figures-august-malfunction-glitch-sfr ) * ryanair was [ fined 10 million $ for disrespecting french law ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131002-ryanair-pay-%e2%82%ac10-million-fines-french-labour-law-marignane ) * hollande 's education reform ( mostly concerning the hours students stay in school ) has been getting a lot of flack because students are now `` too [ le tired ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=kcpjgl2bals#t=45 ) '' to work . 
  * hollande was [ heckled ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=sjmuawhbkq8#t=14 ) at some agricultural meeting ... when promising to raise farmers ' subsidies . 
  * le pen states she will [ now take legal action against people calling her party `` far-right . 
  '' ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131004-marine-le-pen-france-national-front-far-right-press-politics ) in other news , red is now blue and black is now white . 
  * defense minister le drian announces [ cuts in the military budget for the upcoming 6 years ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/03/us-france-defence-budget-idusbre9920sa20131003 ) . 
  le pen , populist as always , claims this will `` endanger our sovereignty . '', 
  * insee reports that the french economy should grow [ by 0,2 % instead of 0,1 % in 2013 ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2013/10/04/croissance-francaise-insee-prevoit-croissance-02-2013-pib-niveau-anti-crise_n_4041341.html ) . 
  we can now party like it 's 1999 !, 
  * the center-left ps party [ holds a conference ] ( http://fr.news.yahoo.com/ps-forum-riposte-face-extr%c3%a9mismes-082511906.html ) on how the counter the rise of the far-right ( ^ sue ^ me ^ le ^ pen ) fn party . 
  want to guess who is going to take the charge against fn ? 
  [ our famous `` anti-roma '' interior minister valls ... ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2013/10/05/01002-20131005artfig00361-municipales-manuel-valls-commence-sa-tournee-anti-fn.php ) * [ new survey results released on the `` most popular '' politicians in france ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/assets/pdf/sondageoctobre.pdf ) : # 1 - valls , # 2 - sarkozy ( the french seem to suffer from short-term memory ) , # 3 - former pm fillon , # 4 - former everything [ alain jupp\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alain_jupp%c3%a9 ) , # 5 - current imf president christine lagarde , # 6 - it would n't be a proper list without good ol' marine le pen . 
   a little war-happy lately , are n't we ? 
  well , to be fair , he 's at least tried to get the [ un as a whole ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/25/us-un-assembly-car-resolution-idusbre98o1bo20130925 ) to act on it , rather than going in unilaterally . 
  he 's not exaggerating when he says that car is facing serious instability . 
  but , to be unfair , [ `` car is rich in gold , diamonds and uranium '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/25/us-un-assembly-car-resolution-idusbre98o1bo20130925 ) and it 's a former french colony . 
  oh , and hollande is definitely a nice guy . 
  but he 's not so great when it comes to communicating his message and taking strong , decisive stances . 
  ** france ** * foreign minister fabius has called for intervention in the central african republic . 
  for some reason , this does n't get much media attention . 
  * health minister tourraine presents the new social security plan . 
  it 's seen as another half-assed reform . 
  * president hollande meets with iranian president rouhani , becoming the first western leader to do so . 
  he basically repeats the same talking points we all knew : he wants `` concrete gestures '' from iran on the nuclear issue and he wants them to `` loosen support for assad . '', 
  * interior minister valls , yet * again * , steals the spotlight by saying the roma population have `` very different lifestyles '' from the average french and should probably `` return to bulgaria or romania . '', 
  this starts a civil war within government , with housing minister duflot and industry minister montebourg disagreeing with him . 
  * senator dolig\u00e9 ( right-wing ump ) controversially says he wants to `` shoot '' president hollande and his ministers . 
  while , of course , he was joking , some seem it as poor taste . 
  * ** unemployment finally drops for the first time in 2 years !!!, 
  ** ... ^ due ^ to ^ government ^ artificially ^ creating ^ jobs . 
  * the green party collapses on itself , with former presidential candidate mam\u00e8re and secretary-general durand resigning from the party . 
  * hollande visits the symbolic florange industry site . 
  he finally gets compliments from both sides of the aisle , calling his act `` courageous '' and `` actually following up on his promises . '', 
  he announces the creation of a public research center for the steel industry . 
  the media , of course , has to pick up on the fact that he did * not * invite industry minister montebourg to come with him . 
  * a minister proposes to lower the voting age to 16 . 
  it gets slight media attention , but no one thinks it 's going to happen . 
  * french hostage in nigeria , francis colomp , releases a video , asking the government for help . 
  * oh , and of course , the big * fait divers * of the week : a mother admits that her daughter , fiona , did not disappear ( as she claimed months ago ) , but was * in fact * killed by her step-father . 
  the alleged disappearance had received a lot of media coverage back then , so it has suddenly become a big deal in the media . 
  oh god yes , the media just loves internal bickering in parties . 
  though i do appreciate that the french media tries to be more nuanced than american cable news . 
  ** france ** * president hollande has managed to drop even lower in his approval rating , now reaching his record low : 23 % * interior minister valls announces that french police found 1,3 tons of cocaine in an air france plane * 2 french people die in the nairobi attack * eelv ( our green party ) is losing credibility , after threatening to leave its coalition with the government for the 1000th time * coincidently , hollande announces plans for a carbon tax * president hollande visits mali , pretty much announcing `` mission accomplished '' * the senate votes on the [ * cumul des mandats * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cumul_des_mandats ) law , exempting themselves from the law , showing how much we can rely on our mps to reduce their power . 
  * former pm fillon criticized hollande 's stance on syria ... in front of putin . 
  this creates a shitstorm in the media . 
  * former pm fillon calls on ump voters ( right-wing party ) to vote for the `` less sectarian '' party should they have to choose between fn ( far-right ) and ps ( left-wing ) . 
  the media also has a field day with this , as it suggests he would n't mind ump members to vote for fn . 
  * sarkozy announces , yet again , that he 's not interested in re-entering politics . 
  the media jumps on this like crazy . 
  * our court of auditors releases a report that says we have a `` social security deficit '' problem . 
  health minister touraine says there 's no way in hell she 'll stop government subsidies for glasses . 
  * hollande says he 'll stop raising taxes in 2014 . 
  pm ayrault contradicts him and says they 'll actually stop raising taxes in 2015 . 
  because clearly the french are not being taxed * enough * . 
  * a video is released of 4 french hostages in niger . 
  the government is criticized for not doing enough to get them released . 
  * france made it to the euro basketball finals ... so suddenly the french media starts caring about euro basketball . 
  aww , beat me to it . 
  i guess i can add some more . 
  * hollande presented his 34 proposals to `` reindustrialize '' france . 
  it is mocked in the media as spineless proposals , due to the little funds to back it up . 
  ( it also gave birth to [ these beaut 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/1mbboe/m_hollande_french_president_with_nao_a_robot_in/ ) . ), 
  * [ albert jacquard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_jacquard ) , a famous french geneticist and ` revolutionary ' activist , dies at the age of 87 . 
  * finance miniser moscovici * yet again * revises his forecasts for the year , saying france would hit 4.1 % of gdp deficit in 2013 . 
  this is above the eu agreed-upon 3.9 % of gdp deficit . 
  yet again , showing how reliable our government 's forecasts are . 
  * the senate law commission rejected hollande 's law proposal on the [ * cumul des mandats , * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cumul_des_mandats ) one of his key campaign promises . 
  from what i understand , it does n't mean the law 's dead ; it just means it 'll have to be revised . 
  * the french national football team beats its 1924 record for the most games without goals .
