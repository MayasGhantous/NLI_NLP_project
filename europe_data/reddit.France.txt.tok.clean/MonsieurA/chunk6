  hollande responded , `` everything 's our problem . '', 
  * politicians left and right have spoken for and against intervention . 
  a bit of a clusterfuck in that regard . 
  * hollande and german president gauck tried to recreate a `` de gaulle-adenauer '' moment , hugging at a nazi massacre site ( oradour-sur-glane ) . 
  the media mostly picks up on the fact that hollande wrote the wrong date in the guestbook . 
  * the main right-wing party , ump , has managed to get 11 million $ from donors , thus no longer having its deficit . 
  * hollande 's ex-wife , s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royale , speaks out against government ministers , saying industry minister montebourg thinks he 's an `` american actor '' and ecology minister batho is a `` manipulator '' * france ties with georgia 0-0 in 2014 wc qualifiers .

'', 
  it hurts our fragile ego .

  thus , a shitfest was born over ` sexism ' and ` political correctness . ', 
  * hollande has announced plans for pension reform ... for september .

  * football club psg has finally found a new manager : our former national team manager laurent blanc . 
  * sarkozy apparently called our former pm fillon a `` traitor . '', 
  yet another step in the `` civil war '' amongst the center-right ump party . 
  * meanwhile , hollande and ayrault again lose percentage points in the popularity polls,

  hmm , what exactly would a structural reform based on these models entail though ? 
  what alternative would you propose to this though ? 
  do we not have the responsibility to get our spending under control ? 
  we have not seen a balanced budget since 1974 . 
  to me , that 's a bit worrying . 
  while i agree that austerity measures will , inevitably , bring about negative social consequences , can we realistically continue our policy of constant budget deficits ? 
  i do n't see how this could go wrong .

   all the relevant powers are with the member states . 
  it is they which clearly can not be relied upon to deal with emergent regional and global issues . 
  and it 's not as if the european institutions have just been twiddling their thumbs in the meantime .

  but yes , it does rely on the good will and resources of member states to actually apply these measures . 
  this is why it 's so frustrating to read about journalists ( particularly in [ britain ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11337315/of-all-the-eu-failures-its-policy-on-asylum-seekers-is-the-worst.html ) ) complaining about the `` incompetence of the eu , '' while overlooking the huge role that member states still play .

  the [ tv people ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/manuel-valls/les-vacances-de-manuel-valls_1042181.html ) told me so . 
  missing an [ important city . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/lgcqm05qszs?t=14 ), 
  i was getting a `` the eu is undemocratic '' vibe from your post . 
  my counter-argument was that it 's not the * eu * as such that is acting undemocratically , but * national * leaders . 
  citizens should - and can - hold their leaders accountable through elections . 
  if a majority of citizens truly feel outraged about the lack of a referendum , they can express it in national elections . 
  what alternative would you suggest ? 
  for instance , would you prefer the eu mandate referendums be held for all treaty changes ? 
  ( if so , how would they even receive the power to do so ? ), 
  i 'll grant you that the eu has been a primarily elite-driven project , but that does not necessarily mean that the population opposed it . 
  ( there has been a lot of [ literature ] ( http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=1884316 ) out there trying to explain this phenomenon of `` permissive consensus '' in early european integration history . ), 
  true , the euro was clearly not implemented in a perfect fashion . 
  however , i think the eu unfairly gets much of the blame , at the expense of national leaders . 
  let us remember that elected leaders first had to [ agree , by * unanimity * , on the issue . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/fjbiag7 ) they , then , had the * choice * to allow voters to state their opinion on the new currency through a referendum on the maastricht treaty . 
  only [ 3 of the then-12 member states did this ( france , denmark , and ireland ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union#maastricht_treaty ) the others had their national parliaments vote to either ratify or reject the treaty . 
  and the result of the danish referendum clearly shows that the eu is n't some sort of ` anti-democratic ' super-state . 
  the danes voted against an economic and monetary union , and got their opt-out . 
   the euro was also introduced without basically any political discussion allowed in most countries . 
  well , it 's not like the idea appeared out of nowhere either . 
  it had been in discussion [ since at least 1969 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/emu/road/werner_report_en.htm ) . 
  the euro itself was a [ gradual 3-stage process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_and_monetary_union_of_the_european_union#history ) . 
  tl ; dr version : * russia 's economy seems to be picking back up , due to rising oil prices * the b ~ ~ r ~ ~ ic countries failed to follow up with their own sanctions , reducing the efficacy of eu-us sanctions * the eu and the us are * already * considering a reduction in sanctions ( she singles out greece and italy expressing doubt over the sanctions ) * isolation , in general , rarely works ( she uses the cases of cuba , north korea , iran , iraq , burma , libya and sudan ) her proposed solutions to * avoid * failure : * `` western leaders should offer a hard-headed , compartmentalized relationship where , issue-by-issue , the west and russia will cooperate where possible and confront one another where necessary '' * upgrade the defenses of eastern european nato states * help ukraine 's government `` govern , rebuild its economy and defend itself '' * mobilize the b ~ ~ r ~ ~ ics against russia 's behavior * maintain sanctions against * specific * individuals and corporations so , despite the title of her article , she does not * entirely * preclude the use of sanctions . 
  she just says they 're not sufficient conditions . 
  the * only * thing ? 
  that 's a bit of an absolutist statement . 
  but i 'll bite : what reasons do you have for saying this ? 
   i 'd probably take a rabid dog on steroids over sarko . 
  as most of us . 
  i do n't know what the hell ~ ~ ump ~ ~ republican party members are thinking . 
  he 's charismatic , sure , but that 's really all he has going for him . 
  ... and [ his guignol puppet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqatxmaejq4 ) makes me laugh too . 
  the main complaints you 'll find consensus around are usually about : * his slow , often indecisive reforms ( perceived as merely * minor * technocratic re-touching of pre-existing policies ) * his perceived lack of leadership skills ( with various ministers mouthing off against his views ) * his lack of charisma * the persistent cycle of promise of ` good news ' and lack of results ( notably with unemployment * constantly * on the rise ) now , the more partisan criticism varies : * many on the left see him as compromising * too much * with ` austerity-minded ' politics * social conservatives claim he 's ` lax on crime and immigration ' and too socially liberal ( on issues such as education , gay marriage or surrogacy ) * economic liberals think he 's not going * far enough * with economic reforms but , beyond all these flaws , i do think he is , shockingly , well-intentioned .
