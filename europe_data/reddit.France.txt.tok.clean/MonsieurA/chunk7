  heh , did n't expect such a defense from ireland . 
  but yes , i think the eu - as a whole - tends to get an unfair wrap in terms of democracy . 
  andrew moravcsik has [ a great article ] ( https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/myth_european.pdf ) about this . 
  if you do n't have time to read , he basically has tl ; dr at the end of each section :  1 . 
  there is no superstate . 
  eu policy-making is limited to around 10-20 % of national decision-making , largely in matters of low salience to voters , while the national polities retain control over most other , generally more salient issues . 
  far from being an arbitrary technocracy , the eu functions under greater restrictions on fiscal , coercive and administrative capacity , transparency requirements , narrower checks and balances , and a wider range of national controls than do the national governments of its member states . 
  far from being a technocratic superstate filled with arbitrary officials immune from procedural limitations and democratic constraints , the eu is narrowly constrained by its narrow substantive mandate , limited institutional power and tight requirements of democratic accountability -- more so , in fact , than its constituent member states . 
  voting on european issues in referenda , euro-parliamentary elections , and national elections , are not driven by any informed antipathy toward europe . 
  european political institutions generate as much or greater popular trust than national ones , probably in part because they are non-participatory . 
  institutional reform would likely reduce the eu 's public trust and popularity . 
  voters fail to deliberate meaningfully about eu affairs not because they are prevented from doing so , but because they do not care enough about the eu 's ( non-salient ) issues to invest sufficient time and energy . 
  by generating uninformed debate , encouragement of more participation is likely to be counterproductive . 
  now , i do n't agree with him on all these points , but it is refreshing to see someone actually * strongly * defending the eu . 
  completely agree . 
  i personally take it more as a joke than a ` serious affront to french dignity . ',

  and le pen was just on a visit to russia again [ this week ] ( http://rbth.co.uk/international/2015/05/27/press_digest_what_is_behind_marine_le_pens_visit_to_moscow_46407.html ) . 
  that 's exactly the type of leader we should want for france . 
  [ 1983 ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jaiujyglmk8c&amp;pg=pa170&amp;lpg=pa170&amp;dq=mitterrand+1983+u+turn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cc_8s-pygi&amp;sig=jorgcgxf3vcdaj3gn1f2it8-aja&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gldpvziqfmx-uqzzgjap&amp;ved=0ce4q6aewbw#v=onepage&amp;q=mitterrand%201983%20u%20turn&amp;f=false ) is usually taken as the ` socialist ' party 's big ` turning point , ' for those who are curious about this . 
  i wholeheartedly agree with you . 
  policies and institutional reform can - and * should be * - discussed on the national and eu level . 
  i also do n't believe simply `` throwing it all away '' does much to help . 
  but , of course , i can sympathize with people 's frustrations regarding the slow pace of reforms , along with inter - and intra-institutional squabbles . 
  the eu has much room for improvement in terms of so-called ` output legitimacy . ', 
  so , someone like nigel farage is * right * to point out issues regarding the eu 's democratic deficit . 
  but it must also be acknowledged that there is a huge debate going on about this * within * the eu and european academia . 
  people like andrew moravcsik , simon hix , giandomenico majone , liesbet hooghe and gary marks have been talking about this for quite some time now . 
  and they 're all ` pro-eu ' scholars . 
  the * spitzenkandidaten * , which got [ embarrassingly little coverage in * certain * countries which shall not be named ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/08/04/coverage-of-the-commission-president-candidates-in-the-spanish-media-shows-the-spitzenkandidaten-process-had-a-wide-reach-across-europe/ ) , was a small step in the right direction . 
  for once , our vote actually had an impact on * who * the commission president would be . 
  whether they know it or not , those who voted in the european elections actually had a say in juncker 's nomination . 
  and this process now seems to be here to stay . 
  [ nonsense . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you 're implying here . 
  are you suggesting this was not the case ? 
  personally , much of the criticism i have heard of the eu in france is of a different nature than british criticism . 
  there is much concern that the eu is far too liberal in its approach to economics ( i.e. 
  the convergence criteria , the low inflation targets , freedom of movement , etc. ), 
  for instance , there was a [ poll last year ] ( http://www.csa.eu/multimedia/data/sondages/data2014/opi20140508-les-francais-et-l-union-europeenne.pdf ) , that showed 63 % of the french feared the eu was pulling social standards downwards . 
  ( it 's on page 6 , [ here 's a translation . 
  ] ( http://tinyurl.com/nn8dd86 ) ) thus , you can often hear french politicians use the expression ` social europe ' when debating the eu . 
  much of the french wanted * more * social integration . 
  i still think it bears reminding the [ second-order election ] ( http://www.unc.edu/euce/eusa2007/papers/grosskopf-a-01h.pdf ) element present in these referendums . 
  part of the electorate was expressing their discontent with chirac , rather than the eu itself . 
  he was only re-elected in 2002 because le pen was against him . 
  furthermore , much of the left was not euroskeptic , * per se * , but rather wanted an eu more focused on social issues . 
  the poster you see in the article is the communists opposing the constitution on the grounds that it was too ` liberal ' in its economics . 
  for those like me who are n't familiar with russian slang , [ here you go ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=huylo ) :  `` huylo '' is a typical russian insult . 
  a person who cant be trusted , who is full of shit and he knows that , but still behaves like he does believe in his words . 
  sort of an english dickhead but much ruder . 
  comes from ` huy ' which is russian for dick . 
  how is that even relevant ? 
  his criticism of putin 's authoritarianism still remains valid . 
  i also posted this in [ / r/history ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/31w00o/the_20th_anniversary_of_the_samashki_massacre_is/ ) , in case people want to read the possible comments there . 
  i think it 's particularly relevant for people here , given our recent tensions with russia . 
  an interesting bit of the wikipedia article i also mentioned in my / r/history post :  at around the time of the incident , russian president boris yeltsin ** compared the chechens to the nazis ** during the 50th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory in wwii . 
  [ 22 ] the news of the massacre embarrassed yeltsin 's foreign guests , including bill clinton and john major .
