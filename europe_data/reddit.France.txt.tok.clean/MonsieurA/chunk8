  certainly have to agree that the argument seemed a bit forced . 
  even the author concedes :  perhaps , in reality , all european border crossings were as dull and frustrating as the inevitable hour you spend at jfk airport in new york , waiting to be processed along with the new arrivals on the seven other flights which have landed at the same time . 
  indeed , that fits more closely with my memory of border checks .

  the only issue remains that it requires unanimity to do anything .

  allow me to present to you something called `` chanson paillarde . '', 
  these are our more `` traditional '' songs , notably popular amongst rugby players and drunk frenchmen .

  the chorus , which does n't really make sense to the story , just means `` fondle my dick with your fingers . '', 
  her husband , [ michel berger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_berger ) , also had some good , melancholic songs .

  my level in both languages is declining now that i 'm working , rather than studying ... 
  npr has [ a great podcast ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/06/26/417851577/episode-635-trade-deal-confidential ) on why trade negotiations tend to be shrouded in secrecy . 
  the tldr version of it : it 'd be * extremely * difficult to ever negotiate a trade deal if everything were made public . 
  the foreigners are slowly starting to realize bordeaux exists ... 
  [ help . 
   good or bad , but it was the legitimate government i 'd have to question your definition of `` legitimacy '' here . 
   except if the president dissolves the parliament ah , the chirac days ... dissolved parliament when he had the majority . 
  [ ended up with a prime minister from the other party . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_legislative_election,_1997 ), 
  robespierre did nothing wrong . 
  and so to the [ `` back of the queue '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36115138 ) they will go , apparently . 
  well , indeed , with the british in the eu , the idea of a `` european army '' could never get very far . 
  in european foreign policy circles , the uk has always been seen as the most powerful [ ` atlanticist ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlanticism ) member state . 
  now that the biggest voice of opposition out of the picture , it 's become more feasible . 
  well , first off , the strong emphasis on limiting immigration and stricter security measures ( at the expense of other policies ) often lands you on the further end of the spectrum . 
  add onto that her simplistic populist rhetoric , pitting `` the people '' against `` the elites , '' and you 've got the typical ` far-right ' mix . 
  ( if you 're asking about the origins of ` left-wing ' and ` right-wing , ' that dates back to the french revolution ... ), 
  it happened in 2002 , much to the shock of everyone . 
  the end result was a putin-style election result , with [ chirac winning 82 % of the vote . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002 ), 
  protectionism and ` anti-neoliberalism ' ( conflated by some to mean ` anti-capitalist ' ) is also a big part of her message . 
  like trump with the rust belt states , le pen is popular in france 's deindustrialized areas . 
  let 's hope the party base sees past his bullshit this time around . 
  appearing ` tough ' when faced with other world leaders always plays well on the domestic stage . 
  it 's something that often happens in regards to the eu . 
  for example , you 'll see national leaders * saying * they oppose something the eu is doing , but their ministers merely abstain in the council votes . 
  ( [ votewatch ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/ ) does a great job of tracking this . ), 
  talk is easy , but i 'd be curious to see what renzi actually offered regarding the subjects he 's upset about ( immigration and economics ) . 
  a [ reuters ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-summit-idukkcn11l2jy ) article on the summit pretty much comes to the same conclusion :  people who were in the summit room said that neither orban nor renzi had raised serious complaints with other leaders during the talks , which were described as cordial . 
  `` this is clearly about domestic politics , '' one senior official said . 
  i ca n't say i 'm much of an expert on italian politics , but i assume this is renzi playing to the domestic audience ? 
  as the article mentions , he 's got a referendum coming up in a few months . 
  the title is intentionally provocative . 
  the content of the article is actually more nuanced . 
   i 'm saying that number of terrorist attacks above 0 is a failure and so what 's your proposed solution ? 
  even putin and erdogan , with their strong-arm tactics , ca n't seem to prevent them . 
  *  * adjani *  * unnecessary sex scenes ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   i suppose it 's one way to end tensions between two groups  .  ... if by `` end '' you mean spark [ six other wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_wars_of_religion#st._bartholomew.27s_day_massacre_and_after_.281572.e2.80.9373.29 ) , cause [ widespread persecution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dragonnades ) , and lead to [ mass emigration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edict_of_fontainebleau#the_revocation_of_the_edict_of_nantes ) , then yeah , sure , `` end . '', 
   deport to a third country , or create refugee camps away from the general population to house them until their home countries are safe . 
  i guess you 'll be happy to hear that 's the approach the commission suggested just yesterday . 
  and [ amnesty 's not particularly happy about it .
