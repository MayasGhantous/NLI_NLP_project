to be fair that dude seems to be mentally challenged . 
   i 'm not too sure about france [ you 'd be fine . 
  ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/u-s-soars-world-popularity-charts-post-iraq-will-it-f6c10878886 ), 
  in france , `` eating american '' = mcdonalds . 
  it 's different from our classic baguette + ham + butter/cheese sandwiches , it 's quick and from what i 've seen more family-oriented than in the us so people tend to take their kids there before going to the movies or during the week-end . 
  when you `` eat french '' all year long having a burger and some fries is a nice change . 
  you 're the third romanian i 've seen here calling the protesters either thugs , nazis or whatever . 
  that 's weird , especially since most ukrainians on reddit seem to side with them . 
  do you have any proof of that or is it just an easy way to dismiss them as radicals ? 
  because from what i 've seen from the pictures that would be quite [ a lot of nazis ] ( http://stateofthenation2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/exam091213kievprotests_large.jpg ) . 
  in any large protest you 're bound to have some thugs joining in and cause violence , it 's pretty common everywhere . 
  seriously , i 'm not being sarcastic and it 's a real question . 
  are all these people from the far right ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_killed_during_euromaidan they 've been using molotov cocktails for a while but it 's not like the police is treating them with more respect and from what i 've seen that 's pretty much the only way they can `` crowd control '' the police . 
  1 : the 31 of august ( bis ) we saw coming , under the wind ( bis ) , a fregate from england , splitting the sea and waves . 
  it was to attack bordeaux !, 
  * chorus : * let 's have a drink , let 's have two , here 's to the lovers !, 
  ( bis ) * * here 's to the king of france 's health , and fuck the king of england who declared war on us !, 
  * 2 : the commander of the ship had his lieutenant called ( bis ) `` lieutenant do you think you could , tell me , do you think you 're strong enough , to take the english head on ? '', 
  3 : the lieutenant , proud and daring replied to him : `` yes captain ( bis ) , get the crew to prepare for action , we 're going to hoist the flag which will stay high , we swear ! '', 
  4 : the master used his whistle to get the crew to lower the topgallant sails ( bis ) , everything 's ready for boarding . 
  fearless topmen , proud sailors , brave gunners , ship 's boys !, 
  5 : we turned luff for luff in an instant , boarded from the front ( bis ) , with boarding axes , picks , sabres and hooks , we brought him to reason !, 
  6 : what will they say of [ that ship ] in brest , london and bordeaux ( bis ) which let its crew be captured by a corsair [ vessel ] with six canons , despite having thirty of great quality !, 
  * chorus it 's a really rough translation , there are bits of old-timey french slang and sailing terms here and there but it should give you a decent idea of what it is all about . 
  your math does n't make any sense , how could 16 % of all french support isis when france has only 6 % muslims ( it 's more ~ 10 % really ) , even if every muslim support isis it 'd mean that 10 % ( or 6 % if we use the real numbers ) of non-muslim french do so too . 
  it 's a bullshit article that was debunked countless times already on reddit . 
  what 's that weird inverted confederate flag ? 
  we 'd most certainly ignore/mock them for the most part , which i 'm sure is similar to what you guys plan on doing with le pen and her `` campaign '' . 
   i felt bad for france just reading that you do n't have to , we all know french is n't the lingua franca of europe anymore and i do n't think many care to be honest . 
  as for the `` centuries-long battle '' i always find it weird to see that sentiment still so alive and well in the uk , we have been fairly close allies for ~ 200 years and i do n't think the french have such a strong feeling toward the british . 
  it certainly is n't as common to see a french public figure have a go at them as it is to see a british public figure do the same and even when it 's the case the critics never seem to focus as much as their british counterparts on their interpretation of the general views and values of the country . 
  when you compare to the germans who have been quite nice and have managed to put our common history aside ( despite the fact that it is far more recent and violent ) it 's a bit surprising . 
  yet the most puzzling part , to me at least , is how americans have mirrored those ideas and ways of talking about the french despite both countries being close allies for the most part of their common history and both cultures never really being at odds . 
  yep  in prussia , some officials considered a war against france both inevitable and necessary to arouse german nationalism in those states that would allow the unification of a great german empire . 
  this aim was epitomized by prussian chancellor otto von bismarck 's later statement : '' * i did not doubt that a franco-german war must take place before the construction of a united germany could be realised . 
  * '' [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-prussian_war ) bismarck played his hand rather well . 
   as we all know , ~ ~ this election is between a corrupt centrist-capitalist and a dangerous populist . 
  but what i 'm really worried about is the fallout of this entire cycle . 
  if trump wins , clearly ~ ~ things are fucked ~ ~ - but even if he does n't win , it 's unfortunately likely that we 're going to see numerous acts of violence from his alt-right base . 
  regardless of the result , the normalisation of bigotry , dishonesty , and disrespect in american politics has thrown half the country into an unprecedented level of uncivilised rhetoric . 
  the fact is that the truth does n't matter anymore , which is terrifying , especially in an age where information has never been so easily accessible . 
  domestic issues aside , hillary would be a far better result for europe than trump . 
  the last thing we need is a us that is allied with russia against our progressive interests . 
  let 's hope for a democratic win both on the presidential and congressional level , and then a commitment by their party 's liberal wing to take money out of politics and re-align themselves with progressive social and economic values . ~ ~ i think that sums things up nicely . 
  it 's not even chaotic by global standards to be honest : * jupp\u00e9 seems to be on course to win the republican primary comfortably ( his main opponent being sarkozy who 's not very popular anymore ) . 
  * the socialists are , as per tradition , divided and lacking a strong leader ( not that it matters anyway since it 'd take a miracle for them to win after hollande 's tenure regardless of who they decide to put forward ) * le pen will take advantage of a divided opposition and a militant core to get through the first turn but she 's doomed to face both the republicans voting for their candidate and the socialists voting against the far right ( pretty much the same situation her father faced in 2002 but with scores that probably will be a bit less outrageous since extremes are on the rise and she 's been working on the front national 's image for a while now ) . 
  jupp\u00e9 has it in the bag and there 's absolutely no way we 'd leave europe , le pen or not . 
  do n't underestimate simon heffer 's knowledge of economics , the guy has a phd in history and a lifetime of experience writing for tabloids , he knows what he 's talking about . 
  he 's also [ definitely not a huge pos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simon_heffer#hillsborough_comments ) . 
  i mean , i 'm not quite sure we declared him a citizen of the world at that point either . 
  god damn america took our jewrbs . 
  the words of a true citizen of the world . 
  if you 're working in a group and one guy ( who already has a custom schedule ) asks to be allowed to work less ( or even leave the group altogether ) but at the same time wants get the same grades as the rest of the group once it 's done you probably would n't agree either , especially if that dude is usually the first one to complain about the grades at the end . 
  if you do there 's a good chance someone else will say `` well that guy gets to work less/not at all and keep the same grade as us so why should i work that much ? '', 
  and you 'll end up with a fractured group and shitty grades all across the board . 
  so your best bet is not only to tell the guy ( who still thinks he could somehow get a share of the group 's grade ) that if he leaves he wo n't get any help from you and that he 'll be treated like anyone from outside the group ( not worse ) but also to make it clear for everyone else that there wont be any special treatment . 
  you call it threatening , i think it 's closer to straightening . 
   if there is no people in gibraltar , it will be spanish , you can be sure of that . 
  if it is not spanish yet , it is because everybody has to respect the opinion of the gibraltarians . 
  do n't think you can achieve anything using the force , the days of the british empire are so over , you cant use the force against the whole europe mate , nobody in europe will fuck up their relationship with the uk over a tiny rock from which they 'll gain nothing . 
  they 'll probably find a way to make it easier for inhabitants to deal with the whole border crossing crap but do n't count on soft or hard power , you wo n't get gibraltar unless the brits decide to throw it away or the majority of gibraltarians make a push to join spain . 
   but they do n't ... 
  i 'm probably too french to realize that . 
  lets pretend they do for the sake of my pride . 
  oh do n't get me wrong it 's nothing more than a stupid jab about canada 's real estate bubble and chinese investments , nothing to do with canadian 's politics . 
  mounties does rhyme with commies and they have a red uniform so i might be onto something though . 
  brilliant , so you guys do have wifi even under the bridges of the people 's republic of canada ? 
  we could invade belgium by the sea . 
  let 's switch the greek islands for byzantium then . 
  can you hear water running inside the radiator ? 
  edit : if you can only hear air it might mean its water supply was cut off and you have to turn it on . 
  watch us . 
   the brits are like literally hitler i read somewhere on reddit that churchill 's house was used as a hq by hitler , ca n't get nazier than that really . 
  we 're in colors now !, 
  well it 's probably going to be a bit less in the next few weeks . 
  can you be a top with a grandma 's moustache though ? 
  they 'll cuddle until one of them ask who 's going to be bottom , then their alliance will collapse . 
  it 's not exactly a hot debate here ( a lot of people never heard of it really ) but i think most would agree that it is unecessary and a waste of money . 
   i also bought into project fear until i work up on saturday [ 2 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4pkt3k/bbc_forecasts_uk_votes_to_leave_the_european_union/d4lsc6v ) . 
   i 've waited for this day for months . 
  it 's just as sweet as i imagined , 
  we use it to store our turnips , it 's important . 
  that 's not really true when it comes to the private sector though , unions and strikes are mostly pushed by manufacturing & civil service . 
  it , banking & co. would have no problems with that . 
  we are n't , a poll was made by the university of edinburgh asking people if they 'd like to have a referendum ( and the majority agreed ) , that same poll then said that even though most people would like to have one a clear majority would still vote to stay in ( 44 % v. 33 % ) . 
  we would n't leave the eu , the far right is the only party arguing that we should and they do n't weight much by themselves . 
  do n't try to find any logic in all that rethoric , dude is going full fascist fast . 
  come on , the german flag was mostly propped by people from / r/all ( plus let 's be honest , it was funny and i 'm saying that despite having put a fair amount of pixels in the original flag ) , looking at / r/de you can see that the germans themselves quickly pushed to help us after the initial absorption . 
  it 's a bit ridiculous to go full revenge mode for a few pixels , we 've found a common ground and people from both subs have been working together for a while now , let 's use the eu flag as a border and expand in our respective directions . 
  sure it was a lot of time wasted but we 're not the only ones and at least what we 've created has n't completely disappeared unlike some . 
  that 's the whole point of the canvas , to draw things on things . 
  well maybe those people are being petty cunts then . 
  it 's likely yeah , the car is certainly owned by someone living in the neighbourhood ( probably the owner of the house next to it ) . 
  the car looks quite old ( people further down the thread have said that it might be a [ citro\u00ebn dyane ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citro%c3%abn_dyane ) which means it 's ~ 30yo at least ) and those small villages ( najac has only ~ 700 inhabitants ) tend to be deserted by the youth as soon as they can drive so it 's not rare to see ( really ) old cars parked for weeks/months at the same spot since their ( senior + ) owners only use them on rare occasion when they need to leave the village . 
  well at least we 're not the spanish but still , what the hell have we done to you finland ? 
  trump 's `` i could ` shoot somebody and i would n't lose voters '' also applies to le pen & co. , people voting for them will do so no matter what . 
  she 's under scrutiny for the same schemes that are taking fillon down , she praised trump & putin ( who are both fairly unpopular in france ) and the party went from a ultra-liberal platform to a leftist one in term of financial policies in just a few years . 
  people voting for them do n't care as long as they keep bashing migrants/muslims . 
   scream like a clown you got some weird ass clowns up there .
