  has achille talon been translated in other languages ? 
  it must have been hell for the translators , [ dude talks a lot ] ( http://player.izneo.com/epub/preview/978220/505/0134/9782205050134/epub/images/9782205050134_002.jpg ) and [ in a very formal & convoluted way ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xjuwszelzfs/tmnpiv7uh0i/aaaaaaaabjw/l9x3gvgcpxu/s1600/achilletalk.jpg ) . 
  and if le pen and wilders are n't elected , which at this point seems quite likely , then what 's the plan ? 
   it 's kind of weird , though . 
  look at the russian embassy in london and its constant stream of anti-british tweets . 
  has the eu ever rejected an ambassador on the basis of representing his government 's views ? 
  as far as i know the eu never rejected an ambassador on the basis of representing his government 's views but to be fair the eu rarely had to deal with a potential ambassador advocating for its destruction . 
  regarding russia and its embassy in london i honestly have no idea ( i had a quick look at their twitter and while i saw some trolls & passive-aggressive remarks i have n't seen outright hostility though ) , i think the brits probably do n't bother because : * the ambassador might be less of a twat/more competent than their community manager . 
  * they do n't expect anything more from russia anyway . 
  * they 're not calling for the partition/destruction of the uk unlike malloch so the brits think they can handle them acting like pricks on twitter as long as they do n't cross the line . 
   yeah sorry but that 's not how it work . 
  you just linked an article with ' . eu ' at the end , of course it 's going to be biased . 
  yeaaaaaah , i 'm not going down that rabbit hole , it makes no sense . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_accreditation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_convention_on_diplomatic_relations  article 9 . 
  the host nation at any time and for any reason can declare a particular member of the diplomatic staff to be persona non grata . 
  the sending state must recall this person within a reasonable period of time , or otherwise this person may lose their diplomatic immunity . 
  that should clarify things a bit . 
   the eu has no power on who trump appoints , no matter how much they scream and shout about it . 
  the eu has no power on who trump appoints and trumps has no power on who the eu refuse to accept , is that hard to understand ? 
  both entities are sovereign and that 's how it works every-fucking-where , diplomacy is by definition a two-way street so you can bet both parties have the right to accept/refuse a candidate . 
  [ that 's exactly how it works ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/how-eu-can-block-donald-trump-ambassador-pick-ted-malloch/ )  malloch has not yet been picked officially and any candidate will have to be vetted in the u.s. first -- a process that includes fbi background checks and scrutiny of financial interests and former public statements before the candidate goes before the u.s. senate for a confirmation hearing . 
   then , to get the ambassador appointed to the eu , ** washington has to send the person 's resum\u00e9 to the european commission 's protocol service which makes an assessment in consultation with the office of eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini -- a procedure that usually takes about eight weeks . 
  eu capitals then have a month to oppose the request and unanimous consent is required for the credentials to be issued . 
  ** usually , any concerns are dealt with privately before the person has been officially announced and there is no record of the eu ever denying a request . 
   `` i would not be surprised if some member states are going to oppose him , '' said jean de ruyt , a former belgian ambassador to the eu , who argued that , rather than go through the process of publicly refusing him after the fact , it would be better for the commission to hint to washington early on that malloch is an unacceptable choice . 
  so i think that , disappointingly for you and your anti-eu buddies , what malloch thinks is absolutely irrelevant . 
  christ , you really think the eu is going to accept an ambassador who 's openly advocating for the destruction of the union ? 
  a box of ferrero rocher would have an easier time getting the job . 
  it might be because you 're projecting a bit but you 're seriously overestimating how retarded we can be . 
  too late now , they 'll have to anschlu\u00df me and my mates . 
  we only want beer , jobs and claudia schiffer in return . 
  then why do n't you crawl back to the safe space you came from , trumpet ? 
   i 'm actually interested on why you guys see this as such a problem . 
  it 's about non-french people trying to influence the french presidential election , how could that not be a problem ? 
  sure their impact is minimal at best , still does n't change the fact that they 're trying to turn our politics into the same shitshow that we 've seen elsewhere by lying and manipulating facts to push their toxic rhetoric . 
   man , english an international language , and used everywhere , french is official mostly in african countries , and according to that map only some minorities speak it in europe . 
  well that 's kind of the definition of international language though . 
  i think you 're getting `` international language '' ( * a language spoken in multiple countries around the world * ) and `` lingua franca '' ( * a language that is adopted as a common language between speakers whose native languages are different . 
  * ) mixed up a bit , here . 
  english is the current lingua franca . 
  spanish , arabic , portuguese , french & co. are international languages . 
   french international language ? 
  really , i know nothing about that come on . 
  [ here 's the list of countries where french is the official language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_territorial_entities_where_french_is_an_official_language ) and that 's not counting a whole chunk of north-africa where tons of people can speak french . 
  [ and a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/new-map-francophone_world.png/1280px-new-map-francophone_world.png ) . 
  dark blue : regions where french is the main language blue : regions where it is an official language light blue : regions where it is a second language green : regions where it is a minority language as for macron being under fire , it 's just the front national being a bunch of retards as usual , outside of those radicals nobody cares . 
  in fact raffarin & chirac where both mocked for barely being able to speak english . 
  we do realise that our politicians need to be able to use the current lingua franca , it 's only a problem for a small bunch of ultranationalists who still live in the 18s . 
  i think `` liberal '' in / u/idee _ fx2 's message means '' * economic liberalism * '' ( as in `` free market capitalism '' ) , you 're talking about '' * social liberalism * '' , it 's not used the same way in the us and europe . 
   no thanks , the irelands are a package deal . 
  you have to take the carbombs if you want the leprechauns . 
  wait , that 's the good ireland i was talking about . 
  we have the one with u2 and the green hats already , we 're sharing it with the poles . 
   also , i suggest we give morroco to spain . 
  i mean , that 's fine by me but who gets spain then ? 
   is there any way we can get the beer producing bits of belgium ? 
  you could have those bits of canada that are inexplicably convinced that they 're french . 
  i we reciev quebec you can get the [ tuning producing bits of belgium ] ( https://vimeo.com/47194321 ) . 
  we only want the good ireland , the one with the funny accents and the leprechauns . 
  you can keep the netherlands - they suck at cooking anyway - , you can also have morocco and the gdr but we keep belgium and monaco . 
  if that 's not enough we can throw in all of scotland 's irn-bru since we wo n't need it , it 'll go well with your boiled beef with mint or whatever . 
  ok so i talked to my people and we 'll agree on the condition that you give us scotland , the netherlands and ireland ( the good one ) . 
  oh sure , those ideas certainly did n't appear during the french revolution , some ( a lot/most in fact ) of them were already in place earlier and/or in different countries . 
  i think you could make a parallel with [ lucius tarquinius superbus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lucius_tarquinius_superbus#reign ) , the last king of rome who mismanaged his country until he was overthrown and replaced by the roman republic ( amusingly , just like louis xvi he tried to get foreign powers to help him get his throne back which certainly did n't help with his reputation back home ) . 
  my point is that while the republic and the ideals that went with it were n't new ( for exemple athen gave it a try earlier ) the situation allowed a complete overhaul of the local political landscape ( instead of a series of small changes put in place along the years ) which in turn gave rome the opportunity to show that it was possible to function on a rather large scale outside of the `` old '' systems ( monarchy/tyranny ) . 
  obviously in the french case that made neighbouring monarchs uneasy , hence the following napoleonic wars . 
  the revolution ? 
  i mean , you could say that it , in itself , made little difference outside of france but its impact on the french socio-political fabric ca n't be overstated . 
  there 's a tendency in anglo countries to focus on the terror and completely overlook the rest ( thus turning the whole thing into nothing more than a bloodbath ) but you ca n't reduce such a social movement to its very late stage . 
  plus it brought napoleon whose decisions/reforms had an impact on europe as a whole :  napoleon had an extensive and powerful influence on the modern world , bringing liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled , such as the low countries , switzerland , and large parts of modern italy and germany . 
  he implemented fundamental liberal policies in france and throughout western europe . 
  his legal achievement , the napoleonic code , has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world . 
  british historian andrew roberts stated , `` the ideas that underpin our modern world -- meritocracy , equality before the law , property rights , religious toleration , modern secular education , sound finances , and so on -- were championed , consolidated , codified and geographically extended by napoleon . 
  to them he added a rational and efficient local administration , an end to rural banditry , the encouragement of science and the arts , the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the roman empire . '', 
  wikipedia . 
  the ideas described here ( `` meritocracy , equality before the law , property rights , religious toleration , modern secular education , sound finances , and so on '' ) were for the most part revolutionary ideals and they 're now , for the most part , european ideals . 
   while lepen control the fn , they are not the fn . 
  fn is made of 11 different political sub group . 
  * jean-marie le pen was president of the party for ~ 40 years , basically since its inception . 
  * marine le pen took over 5 years ago . 
  * marion mar\u00e9chal le pen has been groomed for years to follow the steps of marine . 
  * those supposed `` 11 different political sub group '' still follow the line of the party so closely that it 's quite a stretch to call them `` different '' . 
  they have been the figureheads and leaders of the front national for almost 50 years , their history is so intermingled with the history of the party that saying '' * they are not the fn * '' is a best a bit disingenuous . 
  it 's their party , you wo n't see a non-le pen president of the front national , when a non-le pen wants to lead a far-right group they create a new one because there 's no way someone could take over the dynasty . 
  chirac 's reputation was abysmal at the time though , lots of people went to vote thinking they would help prop up a crook who was trying to keep himself out of prison . 
  i think it 'll be closer this time but fillon has the center and the right locked up and i ca n't see the left/center left not moving to block le pen en masse . 
  or even the first . 
   the second round is n't an indication for how much support a candidate has , the first is . 
  it has more to do with the fact that her voter base is n't divided into smaller sub-parties during the first round . 
  in 2012 there were 10 candidates in the first round , 6 of those leaned left ( amounting for a total of ~ 43,7 % of the votes ) , 2 leaned right ( ~ 29 % ) , one is inbetween ( ~ 9,1 % ) . 
  keep in mind that there are most of the times very few differences between some of those parties , it can really be a matter of minute details in terms of programs , give them one candidate instead of 3 to 7 and you 'll see the front national being dwarfed by the socialists and the republicains . 
  meawhile le pen , with her voting base which has always been highly motivated ( unlike the left which can be very apathetic at times ) got a whooping 18 % ( their highest score ever ) thing is , the french president is elected after the second turn unless someone gets 51 % in the first turn , which would be impossible for le pen at this point . 
  and in the second turn she 'll face an alliance of two parties representing ~ 80 % of the votes ( that 's pretty much what we saw [ the first time ] ( http://i.f1g.fr/media/ext/orig/www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2014/03/17/pho0bdb138a-adde-11e3-86a6-710c1cc5c1a8-805x453.jpg ) ) . 
  it might have been possible for her to somewhat bridge the gap against sarkozy or hollande but both are pretty much out of the race already and her current main opponent is probably the worst pick for her . 
  the left will call its voters to block her , that 's one of their main ideological objectives so do n't expect that many of them to flock to the front national , especially when they have the far left already taking some votes from the discontents on that side of the political spectrum . 
  it 'll mostly be a matter of apathy and how many people leaning left decide not to vote at all for the second turn but the possibility of seeing the front national win will without a doubt be enough to move the majority of them to vote and block le pen . 
  the right seems to be on course to elect fillion who 's probably the closest thing to a christian liberal they 've had in a long time , he 'll probably get less socialists on his side than jupp\u00e9 but he 'll secure the right without too much difficulty and i suspect that the vote drain from the right to the far right will be even lower than usual in the second turn . 
  regardless of why the votes where cast they still indicate the support for one candidate * over * another one , that 's the part that matters , not the first turn where one group is focused on one candidate and the rest is basically picking side to try to sway the program of the main parties for the second turn ( '' * the left will go through anyway , let 's support the ecologists to show that we 're worried about climate change and stuff * '' , '' * the right will go through anyway , let 's vote for the national front to show the republicans that they have to take a strong stance on immigration * '' , '' * i 'm poor as fuck yet i work like a dog for a dude that owns a yacht , thing 's are n't right here , if i show some support to the far left even if we do n't pass it 'll show the socialists that the working class vote is important * '' , '' * i like turtles , let 's vote bayrou * '' ) . 
  1 ) so now fn supporters are waiting for a terrorist act to try to get their `` alt-right '' champion elected ? 
  true patriots here , you sure you do n't want to burn the parliament to get things moving ?
