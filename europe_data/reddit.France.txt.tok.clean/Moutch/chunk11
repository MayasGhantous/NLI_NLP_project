  first of all , stalin is regarded as one of the worst leaders in history after hitler ( including by myself , based on what i know about him ) . 
  then , the marshall plan and the economical colonization of europe by the united states completely distorted our vision of the second world war . 
  here is a graph that shows it very clearly . 
  it 's in french but basically , the question asked is `` what country do you think has contributed the most to the defeat of nazi germany in 1945 ? '' . 
  this question has been asked to french people at different times : 1945 , 1994 , 2004 and 2015 . 
  you can see how impressive the change is . 
  it 's the same as when may says `` you ca n't force us to pay the brexit bill '' . 
  of course we ca n't but there will be repercussions on our future relationship . 
   the mean is 20000002, 
  where is everyone ? 
   do you consider the french government so infested with bigotry that collecting stats would be used as a way to oppress minorities ? 
  the day marine le pen comes to power , yes . 
  this is due to history ( vichy , etc. ) . 
  these things are complex to change . 
  that 's not exactly what happened . 
  she did n't deny it happened , she denied france is responsible for it because she thinks the vichy regime does n't represent france and claims her france was de gaulle 's ( who does n't ? ) . 
  that is the same position mitterrand had . 
  chirac was the first one to recognize that the french state is responsible for the vichy r\u00e9gime . 
  not saying what she said is good or not , just clarifying things . 
  i agree that paris could be cleaner but that 's not the point there . 
  apparently no one understands your sarcasm . 
  must be because they see an american flag . 
  looks like alien language . 
  do you guys actually remember and use all of this ? 
   and it 's odd that france and germany dislike the democracy when their voices are the loudest , while the more `` peripheral '' members seem to like it more people feel like the eu is too technocratic and does n't represent them . 
  they want more social regulation . 
   retardadas love this word . 
  completely agree with you . 
  as some comments specified , it seems that 's not what macron was talking about though . 
  i can but it 's not clearer . 
  thank you for the context . 
  so it 's a bit like hungary, 
  eh ... not sure what he means by  poland , which `` violated all eu rules '' . 
  what rule did poland violate ? 
  how can we blame them for not having the same social standards as france ? 
  it 's not like the gdp is comparable . 
  i do n't get it . 
  this article is unclear ( ca n't find better in french either ) . 
  maybe macron is refering to the posted workers directive , and in this case i agree that we should improve things . 
  this allows europeans to be sent by their companies to work in other countries , granted they are paid at least the equivalent of the minimum salary in this country . 
  however the social taxes are paid in the country of origin . 
  this is a huge problem in western europe where eastern european accept jobs for a much lower salary and their companies do n't have to pay as much taxes as ours . 
  macron mentioned this during the campaign , but since it 's not specifically said there i 'm not sure that 's what he meant . 
  poland is the country that sends the most posted workers and france and germany are receiving the most . 
  still it 's not an enormous amount of jobs ( 400k in germany , 200k in france ) . 
  but if we 're talking about tax heavens for companies i think there are better targets like ireland , the netherlands or luxembourg . 
  about none . 
  guyana was in the spotlight during the campaign because they were on a massive strike , and some candidates visited some islands ( macron went to la r\u00e9union / mayotte ) but apart from that we almost do n't get any news from these territories unless there is a really major event . 
  the worst part is that they experience troubles far greater than mainland france with higher unemployment or higher illegal immigration from neighbouring poor countries . 
  and our overseas territories have different statuses , we have departments and collectivities ( these ones include french polynesia or saint-pierre-et-miquelon for example and they have a bit more legal flexibility ) . 
  i 've literally never heard of the latter in the news . 
  i feel that even corsica is a bit left out . 
  he 's asking a question . 
  of course we would say that . 
  would n't it be a bit boring ? 
   spain & italy are not western europe oo, 
  frenchman living in the us here . 
  that 's exactly my experience . 
  the french parliament elections are in june . 
  we 'll see if our president is able to get a majority ... we ca n't say for sure . 
  fillon won in russia and syria ( lol ) too . 
  yes . 
  moreover there is a maximum amount of money allowed to be spent for the campaign ( around 20 million if you make it to the second round ) . 
  so basically half of this maximum amount is reimbursed ( so it 's a safe loan for a bank ) , and the rest depends on how good you are at raising money . 
  it 's forbidden to get donations from companies and the maximum amount for individuals in 7,5 k $ . 
  these rules are there to try to make it easier for small candidates to compete , and also to minimize corruption . 
  sometimes candidates do n't really play by the rules though ( cf. 
  the bygmalion case is currently being investigated and some heads will fall ) . 
  you get reimbursed something like 800k $ in public money for the campaign if your score is under 5 % so he could tour around france for free . 
  seems like a good enough reason for some random old guy with good networking skills . 
  if your score is greater than 5 % you get reimbursed up to 8 million $ , and up to 10.7 million $ if you reach the second round . 
   bbc , one of , if not the , finest broadcasting and news organisations in the world . 
  not sure if serious ( sorry if you were n't ) . 
  the bbc has great documentaries and some interesting productions , but news-wise i find it very approximative . 
  that 's what hollande was avertising but since he failed to implement this policy during his mandate , people are turning towards m\u00e9lenchon . 
  you are wrong . 
  you 're living in donbass ? 
  how is life for you there ? 
  i 'll banter with the uk all day but leave portugal alone !, 
  are n't the people still living in the eastern part all pro-russian now anyway ? 
  bit harsh . 
  sputnik has basically no influence in france , i 've never met anyone who reads this website . 
  the only influence they have is by propagating fake news on social media , and 6.5 % actually is a huge number . 
  did n't think it would be so large .

  he was killed in a duel , fighting for some girl when he was only 20 year-old . 
  his testament , written the day before his death , is a completely crazy summary of his latest mathematical ideas . 
  the last paragraph starts with : `` my main thoughts for some time were about the application of the theory of ambiguity to transcendental ( transcending ?
