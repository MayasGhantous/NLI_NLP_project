  please no . 
  not saying that for you , but for the singer who seemed to consider his music was `` real music that means something '' . 
  the point is , his music was n't really better . 
  all eurovision songs are pure shit but hey , some people do n't realize their shit smells bad . 
  well we have more neighbours . 
  although you have australia now . 
  is n't that common sense to claim a territory that was just annexed from you ? 
  well the name is on the map but no description for you :(, 
  done, 
  done, 
  done, 
  amazing !, 
  it 's kind of similar to current europe actually i 'll translate a few descriptions . 
  edit : ** france ** : has been looking for a government for fifteen months , among her old clothes , none of them suits her . 
  they are too small , too large , too narrow or worn out . 
  one thinks that she is extending her mourning , that makes her look so good and makes her greater , by coquetry . 
  the other nations used to pity her , and they are starting to laugh at her and anxiously wait to know what she will decide to know what they will become themselves . 
  ** england ** : is the first nation of the world as well , thanks to cotton . 
  friend of the powerful , as long as they are very powerful , defender of the weak , as long as they are very weak . 
  paying wars in cash , civilization with discount . 
  outside revolutions are discussed there on the basis of free-trade . 
  separated from france by the * times * and the channel . 
  ** prussia ** ... : it 's germany now ... ** germany ** : it 's prussia ... a bit of bavaria ... a bit of wurtemberg ... half saxony ... bade and rhein provinces completely ... and whatever will come ... germany is the entire earth , it takes 365 days to revolve around the sun which is german , it has a moon that is german , and bismark is promising germany a second one . 
  they eat rabbit with strawberry jam and their vinegars are very well rated and a good replacement for wine . 
  ** italy ** : according to mr. farini , it is the first nation of the world , at least by age . 
  mr. crispi shares the same opinion but for more serious reasons . 
  she has the right to claim the universe and be sure that she will do it some day ... and that time france wo n't be ungrateful enough to forget that she was conquered by julius caesar ... it 's not surprising that prussia is cuddling with her ... , between masters of the world !!!, 
  ** russia ** : is the first nation of europe too , and of the world , because the tsar wants it . 
  the russians are very happy , because the tsar wants it , very civilized , because the tsar wants it ... they will conquer the whole world , because the tsar wants it , to spread civilization and orthodoxy , because the tsar wants it . 
  ** austria ** : empire of pieces and disjointed bits always busy resewing and restiching themselves . 
  when hungary is reconsolidated , bohemia is drafting apart and when bohemia is well adjusted , croatia is slipping away , and slavonia ( ? ), 
  is suffering from a tear ... and always gallicia is coming undone ... it 's not surprizing this is the country of districts : you see sixteen at least to reach the court . 
  of course you see some austrians in vienna but they are as rare as turks in constantinople ... 
  it is said that austria is on the decline ... no !, 
  it is its way to arrive ... on a tilted slope . 
  ( this whole paragraph is tilted ) ** turkey ** : a colorful rag on which everyone is pulling and whose fragments stick to your hand . 
  the integrity of the ottoman empire !, 
  it 's the custom !, 
  another necessity of this famous balance !, 
  and the integrity of state workers ! ... 
  consequence : the best condition of stability for a political power , is death . 
  ( not sure what all of this means ) ** switzerland ** : the [ ranz des vaches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ranz_des_vaches ) of democracy ** belgium ** : everyone 's neighbour , everyone 's sanctuary ... and that we centralized as our spillway . 
  castrated nation !, 
  and happy !, 
  every kind of passion being forbiden , they live peaceful lives . 
  they are catholic on one side and liberal on the other ... and they throw mass books to each other 's heads . 
  to have fun !, 
  ** holland ** : it 's still t\u00e9niers , van ostade , potter , ruysda\u00ebl and the schiedam , and banks , and tulips , and washing , and painted trees ... and a king ... because in a good house there must be a king . 
  ** spain ** : still the military castanets and the fandango of civil wars . 
  the pretendants are playing all over the place , the republicans are banderillos ; in this bull race , they are waving small red flags ... and run away . 
  they change kings more often that clothes . 
  great people turned into civil war !, 
  conservatives call themselves guerilleros and are descended from pelasge . 
  ** europe ** : fifth part of the world . 
  people who want to balance it always make it lose its balance . 
  very threatened balance right now !, 
  as always . 
  poles and muslims are human beings . 
  i see this post in every thread about french guyana . 
  is it always from you ? 
  anyways , this picture contains a french ( european ) boat and a european rocket , so i think it 's fine here . 
  he 's great on a personal level , respectful of institutions , of freedom of press and he 's honest ( which , after sarkzoy , is a big change ) . 
  but on a political level , everyone expected much more although i think he was n't that bad . 
  in french we say `` pays-bas '' !, 
  sounds completely different but it actually translates to `` netherlands '' . 
  are you russian ? 
  i think the polish reactions to your posts show why we need a multi-speed europe . 
  the funniest part is that they complain when the uk is brexiting because of a `` polish invasion '' , but migrants coming to poland are an abomination to them . 
  just shows what the us would be able to do in a full-on cyberwar . 
  i 'm pretty sure everyone sees their own countries as the biggest complainer . 
  it 's typically french to think things are typically french . 
  they have no choice . 
  if fiscal paradises like ireland and the netherlands do n't reform , we 'll end up setting up protections and that will be the end of the eu . 
   in the case of jesus , i fear , the question would be not even `` did he exist in reality ? '', 
  but `` did people who claim they saw jesus exist in reality ? '', 
  no , none of these would be the question . 
  where are you from ? 
  depends if you care about france being part of the eu or not . 
  thanks for stealing other countries ' taxes . 
  the difference between france and countries like uk or germany is that they have many more precarious jobs . 
  it 's a great way to reduce unemployment but it 's not an enjoyable life for these workers , and it 's a drawback for productivity . 
  if you speak french i recommend this recent documentary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yavkmcjzjmg must exist in german too since it 's arte . 
  just get rid of putin and join the eu already . 
   why encouraging them to nato they want to join nato and we veto 'd their application ... 
  modem is an older centrist party , created by fran\u00e7ois bayrou in 2007 for the presidential elections . 
  he got a nice score , ending third with more than 18 % votes ( behind royal and sarkozy ) . 
  he 's been relevant since then . 
  in 2012 , hollande refused to make an alliance with him , which proved a disaster when a couple of years later he needed centrist support in the parliament . 
  macron created en marche last year to prepare his campaign , this party is entirely dedicated to him ( hence the initials ) . 
  a couple of months ago , bayrou saw that he had no chance of competing against macron so he decided to offer an alliance between modem and en marche . 
  it proved to be an excellent choice and soon after this alliance was announced , macron got 4 or 5 additional points in polls , definitely putting fillon at a comfortable distance . 
  i want them to come back . 
  he indeed wants a different eu but in the sense that he wants more integration and a stronger eu . 
  that 's definitely what people who voted for him want ( including myself ) . 
  no one in france wants the status quo . 
  he 's the most pro-european president we ever had , and if nothing changes during his mandate pro-european french people will probably lose all hope . 
  i do n't know what my state of mind will be in 5 years but i could vote for a eurosceptic candidate if macron proves to be powerless . 
  you make it sound funny but with the rise of euroscepticism in france ( macron did 24 % , all the other candidates were at least partially euroscpetic ) , getting rid of the strasbourg parliament can prove out to be a dangerous move for the eu . 
  i definitely agree that the current situation is stupid though . 
  i think everyone realizes some kind of political union is necessary if we want fiscal integration .
