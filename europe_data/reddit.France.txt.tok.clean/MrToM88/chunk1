and that is why we go for the diplomatic victory in civ games, 
   they often consider themselves coming from a specific region rather than `` french '' . 
  for what it 's worth . 
  this has n't been my experience at all and it 's basically irrelevant for most people . 
  i 'm not judging your food on your ingredients . 
  i 'm judging it on your dishes . 
   we do n't have terrible food yes you do . 
  france is always one step ahead/behind the uk so yeah france would be ahead of scotland but it does n't matter as long as we are ahead of the uk !, 
  what 's important is how far down uk falls in term of world power . 
  if france is ahead by a good margin i 'll be satisfied !, 
  / u/nolok is basically no ( shitsher ) lo ( c ) k !, 
  frenchmen defending an englishmen , feels like a `` i 'm the only one who can talk shit about them '' type of relationship . 
   another minister is forced to resign [ 5 ] due to tax issues . 
  ( i.e. 
  he ` forgot ' to pay his taxes for 3 years ) he didnt forget to pay , he forgot to to declare his taxes . 
  he paid them in full and more . 
  he paid 42000 $ and out of that 12000 $ were added because he was `` late '' . 
  if we are reading this we are anglophones ... to add to the discussion and answer the question . 
  i think in the language i 'm using there are no translation going on . 
  well to be honest we are collecting rtt so it 's as we were working 35h/week . 
  [ because ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/enfr/medicament ), 
  if you want to go deeper why not . 
  step 1 : learn french step 2 : ... 
  step 3 : profit ( aka learn the language from which between 30 to 40 % of your vocabulary is derived ), 
  snecma is part of the safran group so it 's kinda redundant . 
  i was testing to see if you were not sleeping !, 
  it 's in puteaux/courbevoie/nanterre . 
  as far as i can tell from the photograph it 's not in paris itself but in la defense area which is north east of paris . 
  seems like we are back in the time of the gladiators with this kind of tourism ... 
  where is the queen in your 7 wonders ... you must not be a true englishman !, 
  yes , free win for once . 
  tss i 'll tell you why . 
  this is all part of our secret world domination plan or psplddm in french . 
  phase 1 : have a lot of nuclear plant . 
  phase 2 : create the most nuclear warhead of all time phase 3 : blow everybody up and `` apr\u00e8s moi le deluge '' phase 4 : ... 
  phase 5 : `` profit '' , we killed everyone on earth , everyone is dead but we win because endless naps for all mankind . 
   first comment maybe you should direct me to it because you are assuming i sort comment in the same manner as you do and i certainly do n't seeing as the first comment for me is totally irrelevant to the point i 'm making ( my first comment is by / u/xp100 talking about simeon ii ) . 
  once again this type of thread pisses me off because of the inaccuracies and missing elements . 
  for instance for the throne of france there are 3 families/dynasties that have a dispute about who would be king if there still was a monarchy . 
  there are the orleanists , the bourbons , and the bonapartists . 
  we have [ jean d'orleans ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/le_prince_jean_de_france.jpg/200px-le_prince_jean_de_france.jpg ) , [ louis de bourbon ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/louis_xx.jpg/200px-louis_xx.jpg ) , and [ jean-christophe napol\u00e9on ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/prince_napol%c3%a9on.jpg ) fun fact the orleanists and the bourbons tried to have the republic settle the matter . 
  and what did the republic said ? 
  `` fuck you we do n't give a fuck about your shit '' .

  that 's not an excuse , that 's just the way things are . 
  at least for those who protest and are openly against jews . 
  you have to be stupid to leave france for a country where it 's a possibility that you will receive a bomb on your head . 
  these demonstrations have been happening in other countries too and i 've been wondering what 's the point . 
  what are these people trying to accomplish . 
  do they think their government is going to do something ? 
  do they think it makes one side or the other feel good about being supported ? 
  can someone explain ? 
   i 'm french leaving in the uk that 's a freudian slip in all its glory . 
  it 's a squat with roma , they do n't go to school , their children do n't go to school ( they could if their families wanted them to ) . 
  they ca n't speak french very well and most of the time ca n't write nor read . 
  and that 's why you are an evil white oppressor . 
  the rest of us have a problem with condemning people to die for the sole crime of trying to get a better life for themselves ... 
  i like that is it shaped like a rooster which is one of the [ symbol of the french people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallic_rooster ) . 
  that 's why it 's unlikely to stop them from crying . 
  you are always angry anyway . 
  but i have to admit i 'd be always angry too if i lived somewhere where the sun barely ever show its face . 
  i have no idea why you were downvoted because it 's the truth . 
  the french president is such a position that he literally ca n't afford any social unrest , which cancelling this trade would create . 
  recently a poll that asked to the members of his party `` if the election were tomorrow what would be the best candidate '' he was the [ choice of only 3 % of them ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/05/29/97001-20140529filwww00157-exclusif-le-sondage-choc-qui-fait-trembler-le-ps.php#xtor=al-155-[twitter] ) . 
  for someone currently in office this is very low . 
  i 'd wager it matches the unemployment in these ages brackets . 
   this is an attempt to increase sarkozy 's popularity . 
  i do n't think this is an `` attempt '' . 
  sarkozy has always wanted and worked to create a strong franco-german `` couple '' . 
  it 's even more apparent now that we have francois hollande because of the lack of visits in germany . 
  this is maybe one of the things he is really sincere about . 
  eurovision has never been about who makes the best music . 
  you just need to check the salaries of people graduating from those universities to see that the third ranking is just bullshit . 
  i 'm not gon na admit the same . 
  basically nothing is a moral issue in france lol . 
  if you rank by `` not a moral issue '' france is first overall . 
  because we socialize with co-workers especially at lunch . 
  moreover we have `` latin '' hours . 
  we eat diner a lot later than the anglo-saxons at around 8pm . 
  maybe because there is both jews as a religion and a people , you can be one without being the other . 
  i do n't understand this ... 
  technically we use it in france . 
  so for 10 ^ 12 we should say `` billion '' , but most of the time we the expression `` millier de milliard '' or the si prefixes . 
  for instance , `` le pib de x est d'environ trois mille milliards de dollars '' `` the gdp of x is about three thousand billion of dollars '' . 
  i would n't use `` les guignoles de l'info '' as any measure of anything period . 
   today france is very pessimistic and feels very weak . 
  more or less true  everybody thinks `` if we go to war we 'll lose '' , that 's only your opinion  but not only about war , we also think germans are better than us ... we think german economy is better than ours and should be taken as an example . 
  but not that germans are better than us . 
   french people are concerned by the economic crisis , and russia is viewed as a big country too big for us . 
  also true , but as you said the reality is that we are not so weak . 
  france is still a member of the un security council , one of the rare country able to project its military force around the world , we are still in the top 10 of world economies , and we have a little less than 500 nuclear warheads . 
  plus our foreign policy is pretty much seen in good light all around the world ( less fuck ups in our military interventions than to the us ) . 
  i think if it came to the worse france would rise up to expectation and be a big part in the defence of the eu . 
  yes that 's correct . 
  do n't misunderstand . 
  i think it has to do with some sort of football championship . 
  anything east of germany and north of greece does n't exist basically ...
