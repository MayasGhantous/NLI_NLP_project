the dirty south . 
  liberal capitalisms not perfect , but this illiberal capitalism will only end in tragedy and defeat . 
  edit : c'mon people , china has great gdp growth rates but life for the 800 million poorest chinese is absolute shit ... 
  unbearable pollution and pooping outside etc etc, 
  watch the russian news video \u00e4 few times , at about 3:25 - 3:29 there is a very brief `` blip '' of white where the poop should be . 
  afraid the news video is the edited one, 
  i have a feeling that this is actually a ** huge ** deal edit :  at the heart of the issue is the 1987 treaty so the soviet union was willing to keep the treaty , but putin 's russia is not ... makes me really uneasy,

  i prefer that at least a few european powers ( like france / uk / poland ) keep their military tradition alive . 
  yes , war is bad but europe should not entirely reject her * teeth and claws . 
  itt : people from former communist countries praising the move , people from western countries condemning it . 
  let me just remind my fellow western euros that the ukrainian communist party = / = an actual communist party . 
  ukrainian communist party = `` more loyal to moscow than to kyiv '' party . 
  holy fuck , muslims . 
  settle the fuck down . 
  dude , he 's an educated russian emigre his opinion carries weight . . besides , are you fluent enough in russian to make that judgement ? 
  have you been reading russian language news media coming of russia ? 
   russian propaganda machine is vast , it now exceeds the one of soviet union . 
  holy fuck , i had no idea it was that gigantic, 
  i dunno , i was watching the vice video footage and i thought the same thing at first . . but then i realized that reality is really fucking gruesome sometimes and that it 's good for people to have their `` 1st world bubble '' popped to remind us how terrible things can be . 
   2 years fuck that , should be longer, 
  what about sending osce peacekeepers to east ukraine ? 
  since russia could veto the un peacekeepers and russia would flip shit if nato peacekeepers were called upon . 
  osce is n't really for that kind of thing , but its an international organization which ukraine is a member of ( and therefore has legitimacy ) and russia ca n't veto their actions . 
  it 's okay greece , were all in the same boat, 
  this is like something out of hell, 
  i like what you said , and it was an interesting analysis . 
  except , i think the global hierarchy is good ( although i 'd like to see europe be at the same level as the us ... and then all of the truly backwards / insane countries beneath us ( at least until they become stable ) also , just fucking vote democrat . 
  seriously man , even if your disillusioned just vote democrat . 
  the world needs the democrats to be in power . 
  they are so infinitely better . 
  i am white . 
  i like white people . 
  she is so fucking different from george w bush . 
  why you do n't you stop being such a cynical little shit and get your facts straight . 
  thanks for your enlightened contribution to the conversation . 
   you douches are all against first of all , not every european thinks alike . 
  second , you know nothing of how this world works on the global , geopolitical level . 
  i think you 're forgetting how incredibly stupid george bush was . 
  pretty sure everything she did as secretary of state was to undo the damage george bush did . 
  anyway i like her because she has stated that she wants to see the us become a super ** partner ** rather than a superpower . 
  also i think she has what it takes to take on putin in a game of '' * geopolitical judo . 
  * '' edit : go watch her full interview on this charlie rose . 
  she is smart, 
  either she wins the 2016 election ** or ** an insane republican wins and plunges the world into chaos idk , your call not mine . 
  like i care . . she was lied to about iraq and if we would have intervened in syria ; maybe moderates could have come out on top worked really fucking well when we ( france ) intervened in mali to crush the islamist rebels that were about to destroy the government and impose sharia law . 
  ** sometimes ** intervening is good . 
  ( keyword : sometimes ), 
   in some sense bush when it comes to foreign policy and security . 
  absolutely wrong . 
  from her new memoir :  i approached my work with confidence in our country 's enduring strengths and purpose , and humility about how much remains beyond our knowledge and control . 
  i worked to ** reorient american foreign policy around what i call `` smart power . '' ** to succeed in the 21st century , we need to integrate the traditional tools of foreign policy -- diplomacy , development assistance , and military force -- while also tapping the energy and ideas of the private sector and empowering citizens , especially the activists , organizers , and problem solvers we call civil society , to meet their own challenges and shape their own futures . 
  we have to use all of america 's strengths to build a world with ** more partners and fewer adversaries , more shared responsibility and fewer conflicts , more good jobs and less poverty , more broadly based prosperity with less damage to our environment . 
  ** here she states that she wants to get americans to think globally :  how leaders and nations can work together and why they sometimes collide , and how their decisions affect all our lives : how a collapsing economy in athens , greece , affects businesses in athens , georgia . 
  how a revolution in cairo , egypt , impacts life in cairo , illinois . 
  what a tense diplomatic encounter in st. petersburg , russia , means for families in st. petersburg , florida idk man , i think your expectations are too high . 
  this world is fucking crazy . 
  edit : moar from memoir after she spends a few paragraphs talking about how she aspires to walk in george marshall 's footsteps ( aka marshall plan , use american power to strengthen allies ) she says this :  foreign policy experts often refer to the system of institutions , alliances , and norms built up after world war ii as `` architecture . '' we still needed a rules-based global order that could manage interactions between states , protect fundamental freedoms , and mobilize common action . 
  but it would have to be more flexible and inclusive than before . 
  i came to liken the old architecture to the parthenon in greece , with clean lines and clear rules . 
  the pillars holding it up -- a handful of big institutions , alliances , and treaties -- were remarkably sturdy . 
  but time takes its toll , even on the greatest of edifices , and now we needed a new architecture for a new world , more in the spirit of frank gehry than formal greek classicism . 
  where once a few strong columns could hold up the weight of the world , now a dynamic mix of materials , shapes , and structures was needed ^ here she states how much she values global cooperation based on rules and how interaction between states must be more constructive aka ** shes in favor of a more multipolar world **, 
  sometimes interference is needed . 
  whatever white people say they are ... ? 
  ( racist but true ), 
  pretty sure she said that . 
  she said exactly that . 
  she wants an investigation and said `` if russian involvement is confirmed , then europe ... '', 
  people are angry, 
  what a fucking stupid point to make, 
  could be even if the buks did n't come from russia , the men who operated them are still skilled , highly trained russian soldiers . 
  yea , i think the russians are trying really hard to spread their propaganda in latin america . 
   the first question is `` what should europe do '' ** yes ** , wise words from a woman who i hope becomes the next us president . 
  this is not intervening in some remote part of the world , this is in our neighborhood, 
  well geuss what , the ukrainians ** have to ** create ** counter ** - propaganda . 
  the kremlin is spewing out such a massive load of bullshit that its overpowering the truth . 
  yes , intelligent netizens of the interwebs can discern propaganda from truth ; but there are a hell of a lot of people who will believe whatever the talking heads tell them . 
  ukraine can not afford to have its people fall victim to the mutli-billion dollar russian propaganda machine, 
  well bnd / dgse / gchq do at least, 
  of course they were trying to start shit , ** their women , children and elders were sequestered in a house of worship by thousands of angry muslims **, 
  no it 's not , did you see the massive horde of muslims the ldj were running to ? 
  muslims started it , young jewish men responded . 
  why blame these men for trying to defend their women , children and elders ? 
   pirating they are not going to go after someone in denmark for downloading movies ... 
  if the bankers become too powerful or start working with the chinese, 
  do n't be too absurd , us products ( aside from meat and eggs ) are just as high quality as western european products . 
  if my bon-papa needed an artificial heart valve , i 'd trust one that was made in vermont or minnesota as much as one that was made in munich, 
  it 's not racist , it 's the fact that 50 % of that part of the world are under 30 's who have a at most a primary school education it has nothing to do with race , it 's the human development issue and western countries would be okay if it targeted * neo nazis * jihad muslims * big bankers * us neocons / tea partys honestly , if a movement is legitimate i believe that educated people will not be duped by english spooks, 
  yes but , the eu legalizing it would be cool too, 
   they are n't the only targets probably not , but if the other targets are chinese or indian or malaysia or kenya or w/e i 'm okay with that . 
  those people are always fed propaganda so it 's sometimes necessary to counter such propaganda, 
  it will when your country taxes the shit out of the super wealthy and uses the money to support a generous welfare state ... . 
  how much will it help in countries that have a relatively assertive tax on the super wealthy and a comprehensive welfare system ? 
  answer : ** a lot **, 
  how do you think they recruit youngsters to go jihad ? 
  many of those boys come from proper , integrated families with good hardworking parents . 
  but they are young and in search of an identity , they find islamist videos and lectures and forums online and they slowly ( sometimes rapidly ) develop a idealization of jihad and a contempt for all non-sunni muslims . 
  [ bbc doc about jihad encitement ] ( http://youtu.be/qjnbsvwcaoq ) [ bbc muslim extremists in luton , uk ] ( http://youtu.be/sgkmi1wv0ps ) [ bbc panorama : jail to jihad ; recruited islamist ] ( http://youtu.be/lrohhjtfu5c ) [ bbc panorama muslim first , british second ] ( http://youtu.be/uzjwaioqfqw ) muslims can and do integrate ; but vulnerable members of the muslim community are * very * easily swayed to radicalism, 
  he 's not entirely wrong .
