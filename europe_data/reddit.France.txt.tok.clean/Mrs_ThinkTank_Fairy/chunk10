  they certainly are from the upper / middles classes , but they are not aristocrats who poop on golden toilets . 
  latin america ( especially brazil , mexico , colombia and chile ) are projected to become economic powerhouses and major players on the world stage ; educated venezuelans know this and want their country to be competitive with their neighbors . 
  they know that venezuela can only remain dependent on on its oil wealth for a little while longer . 
   chavez ... maduro have reduced poverty by staggering amounts i think you mean * high gas prices during the 2000s coupled with a global trend in poverty reduction * have reduced poverty by staggering amounts . 
  listen , i agree that chavez did some bold things to bring millions of venezuelans out of poverty : he brought electricity , running water , toilets , and roads to the rural , indigenous communities . 
  but that was a long , long time ago and since chavez 's first term or so , he has actually * impeded progress * . 
  he also made the entire society completely dependent on high gas prices , suffocated free press , used the usa as a scapegoat for * everything * , revised history to create his bolivarian myth and bullied smaller latin american states who relied on venezuelan hydrocarbons . 
  they are the worst shit since * schr\u00f6der *, 
  yes . 
  definitely a genuine american . 
  yea they just share a really long border so they pretend like they are closer than are because both countries are pretty nationalistic and they 've had territorial problems in the past . 
   if we are in your sphere of influence we are not in the russian or chinese sphere . 
  well congratulations then !, 
  you have chosen the best option you have, 
  what ... ? 
  he 's spot on correct . 
  yes just leech off of the powerful countries ... 
  this mentality is doing wonders for romania 's image in the world, 
  russia is behind this . 
  this is exactly what putin needed . 
  i have * zero * doubt that russia is behind this . 
   the us , france , uk , eu and nato all being weak what ? 
  eu is weak , but the others are hardly weak . 
  we just are n't as hawkish as we used to be . 
  russians = mongolians . 
  but really , they are closely related ethnically . 
  agreed . 
  us needs to continue asian pivot . 
  france , uk , germany and the rest of the european union need to take america 's place as the main guarantor of peace and stability in europe . 
  not to overreact ( launch a world war ) when a radical , hot-blooded , testosterone fueled young man does something extreme ( assassinate the austrian archduke ), 
  might not be legit right sector, 
  you think we would have learned that lesson after gavrilo princep, 
  [ source : survey from march 18 2014 on tolerance amongst different ukrainian demographics ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/167969/tolerance-different-nationalities-worse-ukraine.aspx ) * implications *  over the past five years , ** ethnic ukrainians and those living in the west region have increasingly seen a positive trend in tolerance toward people of different nationalities and religions ** growing throughout the country , while ethnic russians and those living in the east region have held a much more negative outlook , seeing the situation as getting worse . 
  this wide contrast in perceptions highlights one possible cause of division in ukraine and helps to explain the difference in how residents of different regions and nationalities view the future of their country . 
  moving forward , the new ukrainian leadership will need to work to overcome these differences and unify a starkly divided country while preventing nationalism from impeding future progress . 
  china is a civilisation unto itself though . 
  1,3 bln people , remember . 
  i do n't believe this shit one bit . 
  edit : when judging this recording , please remember the `` fuck the eu '' recording and the `` estonia fm+c athy ashton + maidan sniper '' recording . 
  both of those sparked thoroughly false conspiracy theories . 
  i find such recordings to be highly suspect . 
  well everyone in asia hates japan , so maybe they are trying to own friends outside of asia . 
   obama represents worst of us imperialism ended iraq and afghanistan wars  side with putin because obama is an imperialist ? 
  putin literally annexed foreign territory  protest us troops in europe balkans and poland literally begging the us for greater military presence ... 
  i 'm not gon na lie , these right wingers suck . 
  criticize american policy but make sure it 's proper criticism . 
  * key player on the world stage * former imperial power * lots of africans and arabs because of empire * great literature/philosophers/intellectuals * great culinary tradition * artistic tradition * founding `` father '' of modern europe tl ; dr even the british acknowledge the greatness of france , 
  that really does n't discredit him on this subject . 
  he is also a board member of the american national jewish coalition and an ardent zionist . 
  since zionists are always going on about nazism , i suspect that when they say nazism in ukraine is not a real threat ; it 's not a real threat . 
  also he 's been traveling in ukraine during this crisis so he knows what 's up on the ground . 
  ah , yes . 
  typical anglo-saxon empiricism . 
  from [ * ukraina pravda * ] ( http://life.pravda.com.ua/society/2014/03/26/160075/ ) : the name of the song is '' ** to defend their native land ** '' and the artist is ** lisapyetnoho battalion ** a few lyrics : * we lived peacefully with the women in the village until the moskali appared on the borders , so tomorrow we will go straight to the base and now we are not mere women but a real battalion * * moonshine ...

  he 's just a sour-dispositioned antiamerican weirdo, 
  * thus spake the all-american prophet ; it must be so . 
  this guy from florida sure knows a lot about eu legislative process, 
  they were a minority . 
  to be fair , the revolutionaries are probably more tolerant considering the mostly came from central and western ukraine and they 're probably less intolerant than those closer to russia . 
  they will grow and come around . 
  remember , the west was intolerant just a few decades ago . 
  hahaha / r/whiterights, 
  it 's just that you are fulfilling stereotypes so perfectly, 
  it is n't totally fair though since conquistadores and other imperialist agents killed more than us-american pioneers . 
  i fully support this . 
  i know it will be rocky at first , but in 5 - 10 years we will see that active eu involvement in ukraine will deliver promise for both the eu and ukraine . 
  this is paul hadols satirical map of europe ( google it ) in a description it states `` russia is portrayed as a old rag-picker eager to fill his basket ... '' people , the rags refer to small territories that russia seeks to pick up so it can add them to its empire . 
  * russia seeks to pick up small territories so it can add them to its empire . 
  * some things never change . 
   hey dracula jesus ... . 
  i like yulia tymoshenko and i think she is the victim of an aggressive smear campaign . 
  what a douche, 
  i do n't think he was working for the russians at first , i think he did what he did for ideological reasons . 
  however , i do think that he is operating under ru influence now . 
  so i hesitate to believe his new leaks are genuine anymore . 
  our boys maybe , our drones might stick around a bit longer though . 
  yea but xi probably knew all about this already . 
  the only thing that could change things would be that the chinese public becomes too enraged . 
  but they wo n't because michelle, 
  the ukrainian ** energy ** minister is 100 % guaranteed to be corrupt . 
  i do n't know if this will damage us-china relations too much [ * because this pic just happened * ] ( http://a.abcnews.com/images/politics/ap_michelle_obama_xi_jinping_china_sk_140321_16x9_608.jpg ) and now the obama girls and xi jinping 's wife are doing girly pink things throughout china . 
  rt says `` media is silencing it '' ... rt, 
  that was n't even clever ... thief union , that 's your joke . 
  us credit raters always rate in favor of cyprus ? 
  really ? 
  also , is dagong some kind of chinese credit rating agency ? 
  if we want to , we can . 
  we euros have done amazing things before . 
  wow , russian = / = subject of the russian empire, 
  i thought ukrainian 's were viking , byzantine and slavic ? 
  the russians * are * the mongols . 
  something like how mexicans are mixes of 50 % spanish and 50 % aztec or creole are mixes or french and native ; the russians are a kind of creole of 50 % slavic and 50 % mongol . 
  i heard his book `` bloodlands '' is really amazing . 
  how the western soviet empire ( poland , ukraine , baltic ) was a giant human meat grinder during world war ii, 
  woah . 
  i was wondering what that was . 
  kinda creepy, 
  no , the hen here is a national integrity , strong support via western govs and most of all the elimination of the threat of ru invasion,
