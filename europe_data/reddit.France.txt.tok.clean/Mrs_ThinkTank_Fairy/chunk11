  russkies have to get through western ukraine to get to moldova, 
  that would be a waste of time all you need . 
  besides , if you 're not russkie ( not just rossiskiy ) it does n't apply to you and you are destined to be an untermensch . 
  soviet union was to communism as eurasian union is to eurasianism . 
  fun right ? 
  nah it 's nice it made it seem more `` latvian '', 
  you communicate with them , ask them go leave . 
  be civil yet firm , because you are civilized . 
  if they continuously refuse , you kill them . 
  i think you did it wrong, 
  you arrest them . 
  if they resist arrest , you shoot them . 
  [ 2009 - western ukraine views on economy , europe , and yatsenyuk ] ( http://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09kyiv865_a.html ) this last part of this entry made me smile : * the entrepreneurial dynamism and pro-european sentiment is palpable in western ukraine , with construction visible in the cities and countryside , * ** coffee houses full of students , and european union flags proudly displayed ** * and dreams of nato accession unabashedly uttered . 
  unlike other parts of ukraine , the biggest topic of conversation was not the economic crisis , but politics , and whether yatsenyuk had what it takes to win the presidency . 
  among those who know him best , * ** true believers outnumber the doubters ** , * but perhaps only just . 
  taylor *, 
  yes , but people would `` poo-poo '' away that speculation . 
  wait , this is a walk in the park compared to egypt . 
  this is actually more like the us congressmen who got caught drunk driving or the german minister who had child porn - a political scandal, 
  yea im not even shocked by that statement . 
  i still disagree , but if you would have said that to me two weeks ago i would have been shocked and judged you to be a psychopath . 
  but now , not shocking at all . 
  we literally have no idea though , invading crimea was utterly unthinkable just a few weeks ago . 
  utterly unthinkable . 
  but he did it , and two weeks before he did it , he pledged that he would n't . 
  you are too moderate . 
  all non-russian ethnicities in the eastern hemisphere need to be cleansed and all non-american ethnicities in the western hemisphere need to be cleansed . 
  eastern hemisphere = only russians . 
  western hemisphere = only americans this is the perfect , holiest world . 
  we know . 
  the stakes are also much higher for us too , though . 
  exactly , western hemisphere should be only american . 
  eastern hemisphere should be only russian . 
  perfect world . 
  because he 's from the former warsaw pact , and when people from there warn you about russia , you listen because they know these things, 
  an `` arc of frozen conflicts '' i really do n't get why they ca n't just engage i 'm normal friendly relations instead of doing cold-warlike antics like this . 
  then why are so many european businesses rushing to invest there ? 
  they are saying that lviv will be europe 's ` silicon valley ', 
  you 're mixing up slavs , poles are the most blonde , the ukrainians are second and russians are more asiatic . 
  that 's why poles and ukrainians are considered european and russians are `` eurasians . '', 
  and you 're wrong about them being turkic , it 's actually from the byzantine princes who fled from the turks . 
  this is why ukrainian blonde hair has a deep brilliant golden glow to it . 
  the `` kill russians '' must be a sports rally . 
  and then idk about the roaming bands you talk about , my grandmother says that ukrainians are very christian and when all the russians and belorussians turned atheists ; they remained faithful to god because ukrainians spiritually more open to gods grace . 
  those guys have russian dark features though , ukrainians are lighter blonder and have either deep gold or blue eyes . 
  apparently they are both started off as the same slavs but the russians mixed with mongolians and the ukrainians mixed with vikings . 
  you do n't really get it , do you ? 
  the will take ukraine . 
  then moldova . 
  georgia . 
  then maybe germany is being disobedient , so , it sends in the tanks . 
  them we are at at with a big fast power, 
  only russian sources are reporting this ... 
  itt : people who do n't understand that if russia reconquers it 's old soviet lands , the rest of europe will be firmly beneath its sphere of influence . 
  they could deploy troops into vienna is less than a day , bomb london in under 3 hours . 
  and even worse , the authoritarian style of government we see in moscow would be thoroughly entrenched and admired for its role in reassertion russia 's superpower status . 
  do n't give me that shit , if nato does n't intervene there will be a bloodbath in ukraine to a magnitude that has not been seem since ww2 . 
  there are 45 million ukrainians , they have a long history of determined insurgency . 
  [ even the eastern russophones who prefer the customs union over the eu would take up arms if russia invaded ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikegiglio/residents-of-eastern-ukraine-warn-of-partisan-war-if-russia ) , and again , in the east , while the cities are mostly full of russophones ; the surrounding countryside is [ vastly more ukrainian-speaking ] ( http://i.imgur.com/arioyto.jpg ) . 
  you combine this : the large population , the will to die defending ukr from invaders and the fact that even the most pro-russian cities are surrounded by ukrainian peasants in the rural areas . 
  the bloodshed would far surpass the butchering in the syrian civil war ( pop 20mil ) . 
  and even beyond the bloodbath , i ca n't even imagine how radically it would change the nature of the international order . 
  absolute cruelty on the part of local authorities, 
  can ru afford to keep moving around their forces too ? 
  nato can , for sure afford to move things around esp . 
  since we do n't have to pay for afghanistan as much . 
  and if ru invades mainland ua , could they afford to fight ua military & ua insurgents , chechen ingushet , dagestani jihad , equip assad , fight potential crim-tatar jihad , handle sanctions , turkish blockade * and * play arctic-baltic-continental europe-pacific military chess with nato ? 
  nato buys it at a discount ( so french industry takes a hit , but transatlantic partners help to soften the blow ) allies will use it in the mediterranean . 
  i think the title is very click bait , i do n't think it 's that the us is too broke ; it 's that the american people just spent hundreds of billions , maybe trillions , trying to nation build in iraq and afghanistan . 
  i highly doubt that there willing to nation build in ru and ua . 
   it has been involved in numerous coup d'etat in haiti , honduras and in the middle east , by using destabilization campaigns and even by funding and training its favoured political groups in foreign countries . 
  i 've done the world a favor and removed all of these ; * except * for the consulting they gave to conservative polish and brazilian parties . 
  all the coups referenes either did n't mention anyting about the iri or were from dubious sources ( cuban government newspaper accusing a man associated with iri for causing chaos in haiti ) . 
  the source given for their involvement in the arab spring does n't exist . 
  this wiki article had a familiar stink to it - trying to defame a western pro-democracy group as being a sinister gang of covert imperialists . 
  so i probed a bit deeper and realized that the stink was coming from whole paragraphs of barfed-up information citing rotten sources . 
  hydrocarbons . 
  if the british parliament would n't have voted down cameron 's resolution ; we would have gone in . 
  we were willing , the americans were willing at first but them when they realized the uk was n't willing , then the americans decided against . 
  and we were like `` fuck , this shit is too expensive to do alone '' has little to do with putin, 
  ... north korea !, 
  braziliens are nice though . 
  indians are insane . 
  chinese are idk , they should focus on china . 
  russia , fuck no . 
  worse case scenario is ru superpower . 
  usa is far better than those . 
  however , i would like the eu to be a superpower as well . 
  we could if we wanted . 
  if the usa really , really , really had to it could project power into central asia . 
  and they also have the capability to develop a tech and weaponry to counter recent chinese advances . 
  if there was a will , the usa would find a way . 
  hmm your blood tells the story of the colonization of north america . 
  it 's what i was implying . 
  went to undergrad in ny and everyone was 4 different ethnicities at a minimum . 
  roommate was czech , german , swedish , irish , italian and polish . 
  all in one girl !, 
  the us being in nato matters a lot , dumbfuck . 
  it matter a whole fucking lot . 
  edit : being american is n't based on ethnicity .
