  there is no american ethnicity , they are mixes, 
  well damn , what if greece emerges from their crisis with the most effective and modern govt ? 
  i like to say `` fuck rufed '' because it makes it about the political federation and not the ethnicity . 
  yes that 's true , but he had a certain cultural impact on young russians i think . 
  which means something , if he or someone like him was still in the big office setting a `` good example '' maybe we would n't have so many ru neo-stalinist ultranationalist wackos running around . . 
  not at all surprised . 
  russia does n't deserve this . 
  i ca n't believe how wrong we all were about ru 's future when medvedev the modern came to power . 
  haha i did n't even notice that little linguistic coincidence . 
  it 's more about the fact there were drills with the romanian and bulgarian navies . 
  this is a deterrence to further aggression . 
  wow , that is north korean as fuck, 
  no dumb . 
  alliance should be as big as possible as a deterrence . 
  estonia would be full of ru soldiers if the us military did n't give so much `` bite '' to the nato alliance, 
  it 's the right decision . 
  i think that foreign business people should be allowed to defend themselves against bogus laws , such as the recent cheese naming rules . 
  of course , how else would we protect ourselves when greedy americans object when we ban them from selling us their cheese ? 
  we already have such agreements between eu members , this is all political posturing . 
  this is going to be an absolute bloodbath . 
  if they invade mainland ukraine , it will be a bloodbath . 
  til about the [ semigallians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semigallians ), 
  honestly , i think us-eu relations will be fine . 
  ukraine crisis show how important the transatlantic relationship is . 
  it 's not true, 
  god it 's pissing me off that everytime you post those little summaries , someone down votes you . 
  you 're not a bot , therefore do n't deserve to be downvoted, 
  * center ... ( jk ), 
  there it is !, 
  there 's the key idea to get this thing off the ground !, 
  because it is a loser !, 
  because of putin !, 
   some totally terrified i think it 's this . 
  this is the real rossiya !!, 
  it was a pro-ukraine protestor who was stabbed to death by a pro-russia mob . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10696753/pro-kiev-protester-killed-in-east-ukraine-rally-clash.html ), 
  i had no idea how gorgeous and perfect the ukrainian anthem was . 
  frisson here too . 
  edit : watched it a second time , and my tears started to well up a bit . 
  so beautiful that these latvians show such profound solidarity even as russian troops amass on ukraine 's eastern border . 
  we 'll i hope they 're at least listening in on putins-handy . 
  fyi even though they live way up north where the sun do n't shine very much , eskimos never turned into white people because they ate so much whale meat , which is very very rich in vitamin d . so they had no need to absorb it from the sun . 
  it would really take a decade ? 
  i heard something about these imf reforms being huge . 
  apparently 19 members of the g20 had approved these reforms but the usa took forever to approve them because they had such a big financial stake in it . 
  now it looks like they approved it and the imf all of sudden is more maneuverable or some shit . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nashi_ ( youth_movement ) wow , that looks ** extremely ** fascist for an anti-fascist party, 
  yea yea ... ethnic nationalism and ethnic strife is so 19/20th century . 
  get over it . 
   atheists and former communist party members were not eligible for membership . 
  jews were though . 
  firstly , and most importantly , why would the right sector or other radical anti-government protestors * artificially incite violence when they knew that yanukovych would inevitably use lethal force ? 
  * just think about that , do you really think that yanukovych would have allowed the rioters to completely take-over the whole city/country without giving them lethal resistance ? 
  of course not , he was certainly going to start killing them once they crossed a certain red-line . 
  no need for a complicated false flag operation , just cross the red line . 
  second , there is problem with these leaked phone conversations in that you can selectively leak only a part of a conversation and place it out of context . 
  there are a lot of conspiracy theories flying around , thanks to kremlin propaganda . 
  i would assume that the eu officials concerned with the crisis would be paying attention to said conspiracy theories because they can often be taken as true and actually effect the situation on the ground . 
  as such i would expect them to be having conversations about the many conspiracy theories . 
  i just have to ask : who benefits the most from the conspiracy theory ? 
  does no one else find it incredibly convenient for the kremlin and for yanukovych ? 
  what do you think would happen to ukrainian unity if this conspiracy became widely accepted ? 
  what would happen to the opinion of western supporters ? 
  and what about the already negative opinion of the russian people ? 
  do you think that this would give putin the popular support and legitimacy to invade eastern and southern ukraine ? 
  okay we incorporate that too, 
  wow thats fucked up and extremely selfish . 
  anyway , what do you think the russians will do to the hungarians ? 
  they 'll fuck them over , thats what they 'll do . 
  oh my yes , hindustan has billions of potential soldiers , and indochina would provide for at least 100 million more . 
  i weirdly agree . 
  that 's way too fucking small though, 
  well lets get to at 3 % or something , at least until putin is gone and russia becomes normal ( if that ever happens ), 
  oh , yea i bet we could if we began operations from eastern ukraine and estonia . 
  send in canadian and qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois shocktroopers first to destabilize , then stike . 
  whatever , same difference . 
  ( i mean there is a difference , but w/e ), 
  idk , like liechtenstein or andorra ? 
  or like malta ? 
  i would n't mind , provided they allowed a nato air or naval base and maybe some missile defense shield stuff . 
  seriously , it only helps stabilize everything . 
  yes , all hail the [ ** glorious franco-british empire ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a1ayfuf.png?1 ) !, 
  well who gives a fuck about those little guys . 
  i think its only important that relatively big countries pull their weight . 
  edit : i meant `` who gives a fuck of those little guys do n't pull their weight militarily '', 
  austria has the benefit of being surrounded by a sea of nato . 
  anyone wants to invade it has to go through allies first . 
  why . 
  slovenia is in nato . 
  your security would only increase . 
  besides if little slovenia can not afford it , nobody 's going to force it . 
  its mostly important to get germany , italy , canada , france and a few others to get up to par . 
  well maybe if europe all of sudden decides it wants empires again and starts invading the whole world , then i bet it might . 
  not if its concerning russia policy in eastern europe . 
  combined nordic would be idk , at least 25-30 million people and lots of high tech military units ? 
  nordics would prove to be a good deterrent to russian aggression in estonia or latvia . 
  god you 're disgusting . 
  also good to note , the more nations that join nato the more balanced the organization is ; meaning it becomes less us centric . 
  it also becomes less us centric as more countries raise their own military budgets . 
  if nato becomes less us dominated , it becomes an even greater force for regional ( as well as global ) stability .
