  and yea , that does make a huge difference . 
  all of those seem like legit sources of funding . 
  you can try to paint all those organizations as being evil homes of `` western jew reptile overlords '' but they are not that . 
  for every big time political institute there are a thousand of little organizations ... catholic/orthodox parishes made up of ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and their families , ukrainian diasporas . 
  i went to undergrad in nyc and i heard that nearby ukrainian greek catholic churches and ukrainian orthodox churches had a little benefit concert with a cash buffet and things like that . 
  i personally ordered a euromaidan t-shirt from their website and all proceeds go to protestors . 
  the difference is that the kosovo 's independence was n't recognized by said powers until kosovo had been de facto independent for over a decade . 
  thats probably it . 
  make sure none of it goes towards golden toilets and ostrich menageries . 
  the more i learn about the ukrainians , there more and more european they become . 
  there is also something very `` salvador dal\u00ed '' in them , no ? 
  none of what you said is true . 
  meanwhile , russian troops are setting landmines in crimea , the crimean tatars have been identified via markings on their houses . 
  the parliament buildings are held hostage by russian commandos . 
  the independent media has been blacked-out . 
  now , ** i 'm going to put on your crazy-goggles ** and look at the situation in crimea : * ukrainian women are being lined up and raped by russian soldiers en masse , so that they will give birth to babies with russian surnames . 
  neither western nor russian media reports on this . 
  if you speak the ukrainian or tatar language , the russian commandos cut out your tongue . 
  only russian is allowed . 
  if you fly a ukrainian flag or a tatar flag , it is taken down and you and your family is deported to siberia . 
  that would be fucked up , but that has nothing to do with the current crisis in ukraine . 
  usa and canada are fucked !, 
  i 'm starting to understand british humour and i 'm starting to actually like it . 
  maybe they are secretly booby-trapped . 
  they had better be . 
  or at least be hooked up to nsa or something . 
  if france was invaded , i would be comforted knowing that front national partisans were in charge of security . 
  * only * in the event of foreign invasion would i support this . 
  otherwise , i find front national deplorable . 
  thank you for this . 
  i am not surprised but i am still horrified and disgusted . 
  i have to say , that at this moment of extreme trouble for ukraine , the intense fervor right sector * may * be important for ukraine in * the very short term . 
  * i say this because they have proven themselves to being willing to die for the sake of the maidan which shows that they wo n't be able to be * bought off by the enemies of the maidan . 
  god thats so 20th century . 
  and just how is it a myth ? 
  there 's a massive amount of data suggesting it exists . 
  data that takes into account time taken off due to pregnancy . 
  good on you germany . 
  there are more nuns per capita among the banderites . 
  poor k\u00f6nigsbergers , someone should smuggle in meats for them . 
  they should n't suffer just because putin is a douche, 
  history channel is american , no ? 
  how dud they find our about this guy ? 
  there is a modicum of security . 
  and there would be more than a modicrum if it were n't for russian invaders . 
  what is this , a german with a sensible opinion on the nsa ? 
  no this eu needs to grow a pair and stop letting russophile germans from high-jacking european foreign policy . 
  i care about ukraine , georgia , moldova , energy independence from russia , syria , libya , egypt , senkaku/diaoyu , israel-palestine , iran , tunisia , mali , car , international drug trade , ndrangheta , climate change , protection of women and girls in the developing world and global public health a hell of a lot more than nsa-skandal . 
  for all of those very pressing issues , the usa is a vital and indispensable partner . 
  the fact is that the usa wants a peaceful , happy world just like us . 
  i 'd rather not hamper that partnership just so some german pricks can get their rocks off . 
  quite right . 
  try mongolia or something , i do n't want transatlantic relations ruined because the germans are upset about their sp\u00e4h-skandal or merkels handy-krise or w/e the fuck their calling it . 
  paris is spying on you , london is spying on you , washington is spying on you and most of all moscow/gazprom is spying on you . 
  it 's time for the german greens or piraten partei to shelf the handy-skandal for a while and let the serious diplomats and national security authorities take over , at least until we 're 1 . drastically less dependent on rufed hydrocarbons and 2 . 
  we are able to interact with our eastern partners sans reprisal from rufed . 
  edit : if he wants asylum , let it be in germany but not in the eu . 
  the eu-us relationship should not have to suffer to prove a point that the german people want proven . 
  ru troops need to be removed first though, 
  oops . 
  i said mastermind jew to create irony because that insult perfectly contrasted with idiot hick ... 
  i forgot the thread was about the holocaust as i wrote that comment ... my bad, 
  you 'd prefer russian influence ? 
  so i was right to ask my initial question then !, 
  anyway , once chevron gets set-up go get a job with them asap !, 
  then you 'll be making a solid income and wo n't be so morbid and depressed about life . 
  must insult usa , always . 
  usa evil satan usa stupid hick usa mastermind jew bleh, 
  okay guy , i did n't mean to offend . 
  first , the american company will not just come , suck up you hydrocarbons and leave ; it will come . 
  open up a huge regional headquarters in bucharest or a smaller city . 
  will employ tens of thousands of romanians with very high wages . 
  us state of north dakota , oil rig ** laborers ** make $ 35-45 an hour because business is so profitable . 
  that 's a fucking ton of money . 
  oil will go to romania to power romania . 
  also will go west . 
  i would love france to frack away . 
  maybe i can quit grad school for a bit and work an oil rig ( serious ) and finally , do n't you want us to be free from russian manipulation ? 
  gasprom has us by the balls . 
  30 % of germany 's economy is powered via ru hydrocarbons . 
  if we knock that out than there would be nothing stopping uk and us to go into transnistria and kick the ru soldiers out . 
  then moldova could join the eu and nato ( since it 's unsettled conflict will be settled ) . 
  uk will start fracking , poland will , ukraine will as soon as it gets it shit together , i hope and pray that france does too . 
  do you want romania to be left out of that ? 
  i stopped reading after ------------------------- ** in ukraine there is injustice on the part of the rulers . 
  there are human rights violations . 
  there are doubts in the functioning of democracy . 
  but where there is not all that ? 
  ** * in the u.s. there is the death penalty . 
  in my view , a fundamental violation of human rights . 
  there is not only in guantanamo suspension of the rule of law . 
  the fundamental right to social equality and justice is violated in almost all western countries . 
  here and in many other countries of the west , there is thanks to the enforced with lots of money and journalistic power dc circuit of thinking in the categories of neo-liberal ideology de facto no chance of a political alternative , worthy of the name . 
  the human rights of young people at work and a professional future is set in greece , spain and other countries of the prescribed economic crisis aside - especially thanks to german influence . 
  europe has accepted berlusconi , * ------------------------- tu quoque ; whataboutism blah blah blah ... 
  yes , we should try to understand the kremlins point of view ; but only so we can use the understanding to attempt to predict its next move . 
  i have read dozens and dozens of articles about this crisis and the conlusion is clear : * russia needs to remove all troops from greater crimea and put them in their barracks in sevastopol . 
  no more than 26,000 ru troops should be at the base , as mandated by ru 's treaty with ua . 
  * the eu , us and imf need to provide financial aid for ukraine to help it stave off catastrophe ; which they have already done . 
  the imf needs to come up with another aid package .
