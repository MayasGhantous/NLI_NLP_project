  * eu needs to advise ua on how to create a equitable , truly democratic government that is anchored by the rule of law * nato must be enlarged to include ukraine , georgia and moldova as well , this will likely be the most controversial point ; but russia 's behavior has made this a necessity . 
  if russia would not have invaded , this would not even be on the table . 
  * the eastern partnership must leave the door open for future eu membership for georgia , moldova and above all ukraine . 
  obviously , this wo n't be for a while , as they have many , many reforms to make . 
  * suisse , austria and cyprus must find yanukovych 's laundered fortune and the fortunes of his co-conspirators and return them to the government of ukraine . 
  the us , uk and france should make every effort to hunt down and recover any of yanuk 's fortune that is outside of the eu/eea . 
  * european nations need to start fracking , germany needs to reboot its nuclear power plants and the us needs to start letting us buy its oil/gas . 
  we need to reduce our dependence on gazprom as much as possible . 
  * russia may need help in the future as well , we should keep that in mind . 
  this episode 's not done yet . 
  well honestly i wouldnt be surprised if that was the case in romania . 
  seriously , if you 're that close to russia and you 're against fracking then theres something off . 
  short white man vs tall black man . 
  we already know whose going to win ... 
  no , i was genuinely asking . 
  sidenote : interesting how asking that question is so controversial . 
  says something about putin 's image, 
  question : do you support putin ? 
  this is good for our security , our economy and the global environment . 
  that may sound strange to some ears , but it makes a lot of sense once you dig deeper . 
  ** environment ** ----- * if the eu does n't use the oil then china and japan will . 
  the oil is getting extracted whether we europeans use it or not . 
  therefore , the co2 will contribute to climate change whether we europeans burn it or the chinese/japanese burn it . 
  * russia is extremely lax with its environmental protection laws , some laws exist on the books but they are rarely enforced . 
  as a result siberia is being destroyed to feed europe 's appetite for energy . 
  the us however , has environmental protection laws that vary in strictness from state to state ; some states are as strict as our strictest others are a bit more lenient but all are subject to federal ep laws , which are mediocre by german standards and stellar by russian standards . 
  and * most importantly * ep laws in the us are zealously enforced . 
  there was a chemical spill in west virginia a little bit back , and it was a top story throughout the country for weeks . 
  this shows us that americans overall care . 
  so , using less siberian oil will mean less catastrophic stress on siberian wildlife . 
  * in addition to the regulations being better in the us , the technology is better too . 
  i 'm not saying its perfect , because that would be absurd , but it 's far better . 
  there is a pipeline keystone-xl they are building and it has been the center of hot debate for many months . 
  as a result of this debate , the builder has been forced to implement cutting-edge technology and even develop new technology . 
  in russia , they do not have such debates , they just build . 
  ** economy and security ----- * we depend on ru for way too much of our energy supply . 
  gazprom and it 's kin have proven time and time again that they will manipulate their customers whenever they deem necessary , which is often . 
  * russia has recently invaded a european nation and most of europe is hesitant to intervene too much because we depend so much on russian gas . 
  german , french and uk troops could go into transnistria , abkhazia , south ossetia and crimea and oust the russian soldiers there in a month . 
  the russian army is out-of-date while those other armies employ cutting-edge tech . 
  why not just get it over with ? 
  ( the ru soldiers would likely surrender anyway ) because hydrocarbons , that 's why . 
  edits : in , surrender, 
  which is why we should be hard asses with them and make sure everthing is in order before we dispense a single euro . 
  also , ukrainians are not like the afghans and africans , their society has a bit more structure to it already . 
  the latter . 
  well then , europe is fucked . 
  time to break out the flannel and become qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ... 
  personally i see myself as centre-left . 
  but i prefer centre-right candidates over far-left candidates . 
  the further away from the centre-right/centre-centre/centre-left zone , the more fucked up things get . 
  seamus milne can suck my clit . 
  these little guy independent journalism outlets sometimes do that to get the attention of the big time news media . 
  at the end of the day though , it was espresso.tv that did the initial investigative journalism/broke the story then bbc is like `` oh shit , whaaat ?? 
  that 's insane !! '', 
  then they send in their journos who have bbc credentials and bbc access and then bbc is like `` well it was n't as crazy as originally reported , but it 's still pretty messed up though '', 
  the curse of oil, 
  not really because if that would have happened , yanukovych could have called in fighter jets and tanks to crush armed usurpers, 
  exactly . 
  russia enforces virtually no environmental standards . 
  honestly , [ to save siberia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydznwg5.jpg ) we have to start fracking here , where the technology is cleaner and the regulations more air-tight . 
  this is not a story , estonian fm is probably an awesome person because all estonians are awesome . 
  and cathy ashton is awesome because shes an adept and compassionate diplomat . 
  ... kremlin media magicians that are spinning this as a conspiracy on the other hand , are not so compassionate and awesome . 
  but you had to repost it because ` omg propaganda blah blah blah needs to be protected !!!! ', 
  i like dis new phrase . 
  i like dis a lot . 
  what , for lulz ? 
  if you were on this sub a month ago , you would know that most posters gave the russian opinions on the whole situation serious consideration . 
  after this serious consideration , most have considered that the russian opinion is pretty much shit . 
  i kinda like that when muricans get all `` freedom-y '', 
  guy , you need to step away from the rufed propaganda for a while . 
  it seems like its really starting to confuse you . 
  ... uh ... because . 
  ** ... * jeanne d'arc !,

  i win argument because france est stronk . 
  end of story . 
  i win argument . 
  hey , if scotland becomes independent , let 's join forces and surprise anschluss scotland , then make the scots our slaves and build golf courses on the graves of their ancestors . 
  oh i thought you were talking about combing all countries into one super federal europe . 
  which would suck . 
  but if it 's just military , then hell yea i 'm down !, 
  except italy has to stay out though . 
  they can be the army cooks , italy is made for the kitchen not for the eurofighter cockpit . 
  hey fuck you , france is basically a us level military juggernaut , just with a more compact population , more compact teritory , more compact economy and therefore a more compact military . 
  come at us and we 'll fuck your shit up , byotch !, 
  edit : not sure if people are idiotes or i am the idiot , but i thought that use of `` byotch '' immediately denotes the phrase as joke , is this not true ? 
   not relying on one empire to protect us from another . 
  says the kid whose country is cozily snuggled up under the british umbrella of security . 
  because ethnicity , thats why . 
  people are all `` i love you france ! '', 
  `` aww , i love you too netherlands  '' but then if the dutch started pouring into normandy for some weird reason , people would be like `` protestant swine , i want to drink your tulip flavored blooood !!! '', 
  even though france does n't give a fuck about protestant vs catholic and dutch blood does n't really taste like tulips . 
  not anymore than regular oil drilling .
