  bandera was worked as a slave in nazi labor camps as a zwangsarbeiter, 
  so instead of accepting my discussion as being compelling and worthy of consideration , you label me as a master propagandist ?? 
  is that what you do with everyone who disagrees with you ? 
  people are quick to criticize the us for this , but i honesty ca n't say it enough : * eu good cop , us bad cop . 
  * obviously the analogy is not 100 % perfect , but there is clearly a fundamental truth to it . 
  here the us is offering a veiled threat , if we dug further i am certain we would find that european diplomats are busily working behind the scenes , making deals and discussing with moscow . 
  the independence of scotland has huge ramifications for the entire united kingdom , * especially * in the realm of foreign policy ( it will make the uk look a lot weaker on the world stage ; in fact it could very well take away the uk 's world power status ) . 
  this could potentially push the uk into germany 's orbit or could further push the uk into the usa 's orbit . 
  since a smaller , less internationally influential uk would have less influence on the foreign policy decisions of its allies . 
  with that in mind , i think its reasonable that the uk is consulting with foreign governments about the independence vote in scotland since it will greatly affect its relationship with said allies . 
  edit : quite honestly , there is a very high probability that independence in scotland could actually decrease the overall independence of the remaining uk , since it will be more dependent on the eu and nato and less able to act on its own internationally . 
  not sure if his elbow is even locked or if the angle the photo was taken at made it look that way ... 
  burning soviet regalia and pictures of stalin sound pretty reasonable to me . 
  same as burning nazi regalia and pictures of hitler . 
  and yea party of regions was corrupt as shit and the communist party was nationalistic for the ussr . 
  first picture you gave looks fine , i 've heard that stepan banderas is controversial as a pro-nazi yet its also confirmed that the nazi 's worked him as a slave and that he would protect jews that said they were ukrainian jews . 
  so how can he be both a nazi , an anti-nazi fighter , a slave to the nazis and a protector of jews ? 
  second picture has some boys wearing those armbands and thats bad . 
  i do n't like that . 
  picture of the politician was obviously taken while he was waving his hand . 
  anyone with half a brain can see that . 
  well its never roses and butterflies anywhere , were comparing this to syria and egypt and other revolutions . 
  really amazing that they did n't plunder yanukovych 's palace too . 
  and toppling an imperial russian general 's statue in a territory that was conquered by a russia is not russophobic . 
  if haitians decided to topple a statue of napoleon , i would totally understand . 
  you might as well just say `` i murdered this guy , but that other guy murdered someone too so its okay that i am murderer '', 
  well 50 % of the us population has a below average iq . 
  that 's 150 million people . 
  that 's like the whole population of france and germany combined . 
  and they all speak the same language . 
  also , americans are very consumerist . 
  so if you make a stupid show there is an audience of 150 million stupid consumerists who will eat it up . 
  so , there 's big money in making stupid shows in usa . 
  that 's why there are so many of them . 
  50 years ago crimea had few russians and a majority of crimean tatar . 
  then stalin deported the tartars and shipped in russians today , only half the population is russian . 
  acknowledge these two facts and you realize they have no right to declare independence . 
  have russian authorities apologized or made some act of reconciliation ? 
  they do n't like the word `` massacre '' because it makes yanukovych look bad and they are pro-yanukovych-putin establishment ( because being pro-putin makes them feel like soviet revolutionaries and che guevara 's or some bullshit ), 
  which is not justified because leaders from around the country and party of regions leaders have recognized the gov ` t. 
  the constitution authorizes the existence of such a gov ` t. 
  it 's legal and russia is acting aggressively by not recognizing that . 
  it actually takes time to shred paper , you have to do it one at a time . 
  you have to remember context , yanukovych was being guarded by special police when all of a sudden the special police were ordered by the parliament to leave their posts . 
  all of a sudden his compounds and he himself were left almost completely unguarded save for a special presidential unit . 
  and hordes of angry protestors were headed his way and towards his palace . 
  they did n't have time to shred , it was all sudden . 
  so they threw stuff into the nearby river , hoping the heavy bundles would sink . 
  and many bundle did sink , but some documents floated as well . 
  when the people arrived the found the floating documents and thought `` i bet there are some documents that sank '' so they dove and found them . 
  yanukovychs main compound was so hastily abandoned that they even left the recent security camera footage . 
  wait , these journalists got into scuba suits and dove into yanukovych 's private lakes solely to get some of these documents . 
  sometimes the truth is the truth . 
  when usa butchered civilians with its drones , the media in the mideast and pakistan was abuzz with those horrors . 
  when that happened we hailed it as investigative journalism , because they dug up the truth about us atrocities . 
  the initial kyivpost article is investigative journalism too , they 've dug up the truth because it was the truth that needed to be said . 
  not me , i 'll fucking fly to america buy a rocket launcher in texas , fly to ukraine to fucking fight . 
  do n't send a american soldier to do a french woman 's job ( i.e. 
  kill russian invaders ), 
  this is completely false . 
  you have been completely duped by kremlin propaganda . 
  people are commenting that this is nothing new because russia has a naval base nearby . 
  what these commenters are failing to note is that the movements of these russian ships are ** highly ** unprecedented . 
  they are sailing by geographical places that they have not been near before . 
  furthermore , russia is supposed to clearly communicate its naval actions to the ukrainian government , which it is not ** properly ** doing i.e. 
  giving very little information and not fulfilling the ua govs inquiries . 
  this is the same as if us troops stationed in germany started marching infantry and tank divisions in unauthorized areas without informing berlin . 
  the globe and mail is not a propaganda source , it is highly respectable . 
  this is a real issue the country faces , a leader had concrete plans to massacre his own people . 
  the `` anti-terrorism '' operation was already underway by the time the opposition struck a deal with yanukovych . 
  we saw videos of snipers and government forces with ak-47s . 
  this is very serious for the ukrainian people and whataboutism is highly counter-productive . 
  ... i 'm french btw , i just love eesti, 
  what ? 
  fuck you , do n't try to minimize eesti 's accomplishments . 
  i was n't saying mutual intelligibility i was saying ease of learning . 
  and a lot of this division is being stoked by russian media . 
  they 're deliberately freaking people in the east out , overplaying the right-wing crap and the russophobia crap . 
  if the fucking kremlin would shut the fuck up and butt out things would return to normalcy . 
  idk i think they 'll get over it . 
  honestly russian and ukrainian are as different as catalan and french . 
  i mean i know they 're different but ... come on . 
  not that hard to learn french if catalan is your native language . 
  i do n't think crimea was stabbed in the back , those guys are fine down there they just have to learn ukrainian . 
  i do n't see why that 's a big deal . 
  you go to the french part of switzerland and they can all speak german and italian . 
  go to the german part and they can all speak french and maybe italian . 
  go to the italian part and they can speak german and french . 
  they learn each others languages so the crimean russians can learn ukrainian . 
  the ukrainians already know russian so it 's a fair trade . 
  these ukrainians are a very artistic people it seems , i think they will fit well in europe, 
  because then you get this scenario where you have a bunch of ethnic ukrainians in russia . 
  only 17 % of the population is ethnic russian , the rest of the russian speakers are ethnic ukrainian . 
  most of eastern ukraine is ethinic ukrainians that speak russian , so partition would not work because then the ethnic ukrainians would want to be with the other ukrainians . 
   because unlike euromaidan , this probably is n't a right wing inspired movement [ ** the protestors only want real democracy ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvds2aiiwla&amp;feature=share&amp;list=uufvb4bxbb132d6kczrm5ghq&amp;index=1 ) those people in euromaidan are [ ** heroes that have sacrificed to save their country . 
  ** ] ( http://youtu.be/forq6u1reac ), 
  these are all ultranationalists , lets be real . 
  the guys in the video are ultranationalists . 
  is that good enough for you ? 
  yea thats exactly what russia would want !,
