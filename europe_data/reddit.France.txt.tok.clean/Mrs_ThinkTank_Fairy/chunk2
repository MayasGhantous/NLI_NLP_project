  the uk has a fairly large muslim population , no ? 
  actually yea , it will . 
  yea ... * when you actually see the mutilated corpse *, 
  yea but it 's not okay to riot against a fucking synagogue there are children and families and old people in there, 
  well i thought all germans love their metz und semmels, 
  shhh , let the irish have their day, 
   but must also be a time for strong european efforts to create a prospect of stability and peace amen to that, 
  i do n't believe so , apparently they are also known as [ kaiser rolls and br\u00f6tchen ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaiser_roll ) . 
  the germans love those, 
  have cold cuts cheese and semmel rolls on hand . 
   kiev is set to become an intellectual refuge for those who find moscow too oppressive . 
  woah , a eastern european country with a brain ** gain **, 
  kyiv is already * super * bilingual ; probably the way barcelona is bilingual : 90 % of native people speak both languages, 
  so if we get debt under control , we will have another [ * trente glorieuses * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trente_glorieuses ) ? 
   except that china does n't do any of that . 
  it absolutely does . 
   mccarthyism and subtle racism on your side . 
  you still believe that the `` reds '' are here this has nothing to do with communism or ideology . 
  this has to do with the fact that china 's global influence is rising rapidly while european global influence is declining . 
  currently , the center of global power is the north atlantic . 
  nations of the north atlantic dictate the norms and standards of the global economy . 
  this power is switching to the south china sea , and in 50 years it will be china who dictates international norms to its neighbors in the south china sea . 
  this will profoundly affect the way european society works and the way europe interacts with the world . 
   fevered conspiracy theories is it really a fever conspiracy theory to say that the central objective of chinese policy is to take over from the united states , japan and germany as the world 's premier source of advanced manufactured products ? 
  and to move control of the global economy from the north atlantic to the south china sea ? 
  and is it really a conspiracy theory to assert that beijing is pressuring berlin . 
  [ the number of trips chancellor merkel has made to the country : seven . 
  ** but that number also shows just how hard it is to deal with the increasingly assertive asian giant . 
  ** ] ( http://www.dw.de/germany-and-china-a-special-relationship/a-17759575 ), 
   leading cause of suffering in this world for the past 70 years [ battle deaths per 100,000 people in the past 100 years . 
  is this any more bullshit than the very real fact that moscow has used germany 's dependence on russian hydrocarbons to manipulate germany 's foreign policy ? 
  edit : all i ask is that you keep your eyes open and be an impartial judge . 
  never said that , just that historically their leadership has used access to china 's vast markets to manipulate other countries . 
  i 'm not making a moral judgement , i 'm just proposing an increasing plausible hypothesis based on current attitudes in the german media , the current global geopolitical climate , the current east asian geopolitical climate , the current state of sino-american relations , and the historical precedence of beijing using market access as a geopolitical tool . 
  germans are getting way too friendly with the chinese . 
  this is all part of the chinese forcing the germans to embarrass the us in order to receive preferential access to the chinese market . 
  just pay attention to the german media coverage of china and the us and you will notice how favorably it castes china and how negatively it castes the us . 
  i know thats why its weird, 
  shit , this is weird . 
  his dad is christian . . 
  ** noooo ** le pen with two n 's !, 
  you 've chanted my [ * porte-poisse * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3an7g7u.gif ) you fool !, 
  minimum swarthiness to qualify as scapegoat : http://i.imgur.com/y6b6axj.jpg, 
  we may bulldoze roma camps but at least we are n't about to lose 1/3 of our territory to separatists this fall . 
  omg finally ** this ** is what i have been waiting for : an espionage leak war between the west and russia . 
  wikileaks was interesting , snowden files also ... but it would be truly mindblowing if moscow , berlin , london , paris and washington start leaking and * counter-leaking * eachothers secrets, 
  duh , saw that almost immediately . 
  but of course , politicians must do the dance if the voters demand it . 
  i blame the english , not the prime minister . 
   convinced they were hunting down a russian agent , they were astonished when he confessed he to spying for the americans . 
  this makes me uneasy . 
  i do n't like that russia is playing a part in this , they are masters of manipulating germans . 
  if the germans thought he was a russian spy , then there must be evidence that supports that 's . 
  now , i hope there is more evidence that he is an american spy than just a confession . 
  i 'm pretty sure every european country has had patriot act equivalent laws for quite some time, 
  * wrong * . 
  it 's about making sure that the euro is the next global currency and not the yuan . 
  i 'm sorry but is n't this just hiring advertising marketers ? 
  does n't coca cola do this same sort of thing when they launch a new product ? 
  ca n't you spend like $ 60 and get a star named after you ? 
  i have a sense that the whole `` directing mafiosos to set up a violent rogue state in a major metropolitan area to use as leverage when trying to manipulate an entire nation '' is even more childish ... 
  i 'm not sure why people do n't see this as anything but brilliant . 
  vladimir vladimirovich is doing a lot to hinder the progress of the ukrainian state , not to mention the fact that he unleashed a squad of goons to terrorize the east . 
  if this makes the ukrainians laugh and feel confidence ; good . 
  someone said it well a few days ago that putin is becoming a silly george w bush clown character . 
  he just does n't have the bravado he used to . 
  idk , maybe i 'm seeing him as clown now because whenever i read the headlines it 's says '' [ poutine 's ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hrffubspmn0/t_ovxplcdxi/aaaaaaaaczw/ogsoo9yaxgg/s1600/7.8+poutine.jpg ) invasion threat '', 
  russia 's really pushing the whole * divide et impera * strategy lately . 
  kind of reminds me when sm\u00e9agol poisons a mentally exhausted frodo against sam by convincing him that sam has designs to steal the ring, 
  idk but his eyebrows are those of a predatory wolverine, 
   russians are an excuse yes . 
  because we have to be proactive to prevent them from ruthlessly drowning the rights of the slavs , orthodox latins , magyars and baltics in a cosmically gargantuan tsunami of shit  playing the crazy americans ' game pretty sure the americans are playing in what is mostly * our * crazy game because for some retarded reason we are n't able to muster up a unified foreign policy and exert the full force that our european superpower is truly capable, 
  glenn , i have a secret to tell you ... * western europeans are benefiting from this spying too * brazil does not have a crazy russia on its borders trying to cause a ruckus with its gas influence so it does not need to the massive american * sp\u00e4h-apparat *, 
  some pretty fucked up shit was done in the age of imperialism . 
  lots of atrocities that are on par with those of the belgian-congo , rape of nanjing , boer wars , spanish conquista of paradise etc. . . 
  i just read about [ ** the hanoi hilton ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnat655.jpg ) it was not a luxury hotel , but rather that was the name sarcastically given to it by horrified american troops after learning of it during the vietnam war . 
  the french colonial govt called it * maison centrale * which means `` main / central house '' and it was known to the vietnamese as * h\u00f4a l\u00f2 * which means `` fiery hell furnace '' it was the greatest and most terrible of the five torture dungeons placed throughout indochina for anyone who challenged french rule . 
   hexthorpe has a population of 3,300 and 500 roma residents , most of whom are said to have arrived since january yea that 's a fucking insane increase of roma to townie ratio, 
  interesting ... mind if i ask whether or not you 're chinese or indonesian or something ? 
  i 'm just curious because almost everyone in europe , north america and latin america know that louis xiv was the sun king . 
  there are pros and cons , his legacy is positive though . 
  as someone mentioned , france became a superpower during the sun king 's rule . 
  france 's great hard power at the time had many sources : population , wealth , technological edge , overseas colonies as well as decisive leadership . 
  however , france 's simultaneous ascendancy to * soft superpower * status can almost be total contributed to the sun king ... sure france had a great cultural tradition but louis xiv pumped steroids into this tradition ( ex : the hall of mirrors in versailles and just as importantly , the glam-charged `` fashion of the sun kings court '' ) monarchs throughout europe wanted to emulate the ritz and dazzle that louis xiv created - the habsburgs , hohenzollerns , wittelsbachers , romanovs and many others that simply could not afford to even come close to the splendor of the sun king . 
  as you may imagine , this had a tremendous diplomatic effect . 
  the combination of military might and royal splendor gave the impression that the sun king of france was a being of immense superiority , over his subjects , the subjects of of other european realms and the sovereigns of other european realms . 
  [ for example , if he were alive today louis xiv would enthusiastically pull this kind of stunt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r5hl789.jpg ) louis xiv was not without flaws , it could be argued that the sun king set a standard for royal extravagance that his successors were to weak to sustainably maintain . 
  another huge criticism of louis xiv was that he stripped french protestants of their rights by revoking the edict of nantes . 
  as a result a massive french protestants fled france and france experienced a heavy brain drain , since many protestants had dedicated themselves to business and finance . 
  i think we need to re-restore the monarchy ** solely ** so we can have someone who can bitch-slap elizabeth windsor without breaching proper etiquette ( since individuals of equal aristocratic rank are free to bitch-slap each other ), 
  louis xiv , * le roi soleil * because he was a flashy bitch who had [ panache like no other ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vd9c6bb.jpg ) edit : look at him strut like the grand french cock that he is . 
  russia did this , not the eu . 
  russia did this by acting the way it is . 
  we * can not * allow that kind of aggression right on our doorstep . 
  we must stay the course and stand up to those who seek to weaken us . 
  the investment may be pleasant in the short run , but in the long run it will make us more dependent on gazprom and less able to deal with the kremlin on equal footing . 
  this is way too serious to give in , we are playing the kremlin 's game and any sign of weakness will be fully taken advantage of . 
  edit : they will try to do the same thing they did with the nord stream in germany . 
  they will use the south stream pipeline to deliver discounted gas to austria , italy and eventually to france . 
  the business communities of all these countries will become hooked on the south stream gas .
