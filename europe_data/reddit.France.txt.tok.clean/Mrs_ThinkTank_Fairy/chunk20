   on the other hand if you asked about english they 'd say `` maybe '' . 
  you obviously do not know much about france . 
  and russian is a dialect of ukrainian so its not hard for a russian speaker to learn ukrainian . 
  i do n't think anyone 's going to take their culture , i just think they 're going to ask that they learn to speak the language of the country they live in . 
  like in pays basque we do n't demand they abandon their culture and the basque language , we just expect that they learn french so they can properly participate in society and so they do n't get left behind . 
  it 's not really oppression . 
  at all . 
  maidan fights were noble struggles against tyranny . 
  flag burning was just displaying hatred ,, 
  the fact that we want to pass on our genes does not really fit into the nature vs nurture debate . 
  its pretty much just straight nature ... otherwise we would n't exist at all because the first organism would not have reproduced its genes because it would not have had any parent to nurture its desire to pass on its genes . 
  wait , no i 'm not saying it 's ideology i 'm saying its biology . 
  did you miss the `` hard-wired into our brains '' bit ? 
  chimps , wolves , and lions all have similar hard-wired instincts edit : i 'm actually saying that flag-burning is barbaric in the heads of any people who associate the flag with their kin . 
  which depends on culture . 
  ukrainians associate the ukrainian flag with their family , their homeland , their fellow-countrymen ; so flag burning has a strong emotional impact on them ... danes on the other hand , do n't associate much with their flag so they really did n't care when islamic extremist burnt their flag after the muhammed cartoon incident, 
  humanity is not ready to accept what your saying . 
  we humans are instinctually compelled to protect our own `` tribes '' and part of protecting our tribes is protecting our `` tribal territory . '', 
  * the modern nation-state is arguably an extension of our `` tribal territory . '', 
  it is hard-wired into our brains to want to preserve the territory of `` our people . '', 
  do you follow ? 
  * `` ukraine '' may be arbitrary , but the concept of ukraine is deeply hardwired into the brains of the ukrainian people ; so much so that many of them are willing to die to defend its integrity . 
  why would they die to defend its integrity ? 
  * because if their kin hold a large territory then their kin will be able to produce more offspring and the genes of their kin will be more likely to persist . 
  * since these individuals share a certain percentage of their genes with their kin , the willingness to sacrifice one 's life to ensure the greater survival of many of one 's kin is evolutionarily selected for . 
  so back to your questions : `` who cares if they ` hate ' ukraine ? 
  * if members of a rival kin-group ( the russians in crimea ) express hatred for the ukrainian 's territory ; then that suggests that they might want to take or destroy the `` tribal territory '' of the ukrianians . 
  the flag symbolizes the ukrainian tribal territory , so burning it signals contempt for ukrainian territory . 
  this [ ** nazi thug ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qa7atfn.png ) is absolutely terrifying . 
  [ ** blood thirsty fascists . 
  more [ ** right-wing terrorists ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lyxu4lz.jpg ) ... sends a shiver down my spine, 
  hmm no usa should not worry about eurasia and russia , we europeans know how to properly interact with russia much better than the americans . 
  let america and japan do their thing with china in asia . 
  and let europe do our thing with russia in eurasia/central asia . 
  hopefully that will make the world safe and peaceful . 
  burning a flag means `` we fucking hate you '' al-qaeda burns american flag because they hate america . 
  crimean ultranationalists burn the ukrainian flag because they hate ukraine . 
  yes . 
  edit : the flag burning means their not protesting because they love crimea , theyre protesting because they hate ukraine . 
  i once worked with a guy from crimea , once he found out that i believed the theory of evolution to be fact , he would n't stop pestering me about creationism . 
  every week he would bring me a dvd of a creationism seminar given by some crazy fundementalist christian from texas . 
  this is [ creation seminar 1 : age of the earth ] ( http://youtu.be/szbtl3s24my ) incase anyones interested . 
  its hilarious . 
  there is another video of protestors in crimea burning the american flag . 
  these are hardcore ultranationalists , so western ukraine is not the only place where the far-right lives . 
  i never saw it , i did n't see any russian flags at all , only eu flags being waved proudly . 
  i 'm sure some kids somewhere defaced a russian flag , but they did n't do it at the maidan . 
  there were cameras everywhere , live streams on every corner . 
  additionally , rt and voice of russia were on constant vigilance for anything even remotely controversial and offensive coming from the protestors , but still there was not one burning of the russian flag that i recall . 
  you know what though , i never saw a euromaidan protest burn the russian flag . 
  but in this video they were burning the american flag . 
  if you think that these crimeans are n't nationalistic and hateful , then you are dead wrong . 
  russia has a huge global propaganda presence and ukraine does not . 
  i do n't think its appropriate to label the euromaidan as a neo-nazi movement . 
  i think theres a place for a discussion about facsism in ukraine , but that time is not now . 
  its kind of a distraction to be honest , i get the feeling that the russian media is over-playing its significance . 
  do you think the russian media is over-playing its significance to scare ukrainians in the east away from euromaidan ? 
  or to sway public opinion in the west away from euromaidan ? 
  thats not what hes saying , do n't put words in his mouth . 
  he 's saying they are like the alabama of ukraine . 
  he 's not a historian he 's just a ukrainian dude telling you how it is . 
  do n't you think the nationalist cause will dissipate once ukraine finally throws off russian interference ? 
  it seems like thats pretty much the only thing they have to run on , a once trick pony as they say . 
  no i do n't think its comparable to swiss germans voting to remove other languages from official status , i think its more akin to deutschland telling bavaria that hochdeutsch will be used for official purposes and not bayerisch . 
  since ukrainian and russian are essentially dialects of the same language . 
  edit : you linked to an article for novorossiya to support your point that those lands have been russian for hundreds of years ... yet the russians only conquered that territory in the late 18th century and [ before they were ukrainian lands under the zaporizhians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaporizhian_sich ) . 
  it should also be noted that novorossiya existed for a shorter amount of time than british india . 
  some people see wealth as a substitute for evil corruption . 
  i was talking about wealth in the sense that even though i 'm a poor as shit grad student , i can still afford to buy an ipad and half-way decent clothes because the society i live in is relatively fair . 
  god , i knew a woman from ukraine who was an anesthesiologist , who had work published in several reputable scientific journals and she could hardly afford to pay for her children 's school tuition and was deeply dependent on remittances from her sisters who worked as maids in chicago , usa . 
  basically me , poor as shit french grad student have a more `` luxurious '' life than this extremely accomplished ukrainian doctor , who is 10x as skilled as i am . 
  edit : girl from ukraine --  woman from ukraine, 
  excuse me , the european model is actually the most effective , therefore better . 
  i would argue that north america , japan , south korea , australia , new zealand , singapore , hong kong , taiwan , chile and malaysia have all done quite well for themselves and that success owes in large part to their adoption of the european model of liberal/social democracy . 
  i am ** not ** suggesting that europeans are superior , only that a combination of geography , history and cultural dynamics set europe on a path that created the european enlightenment and thus the concept of a modern liberal/social democracy that is rooted in the rule of law . 
  the european liberal democracy and its very close twin the european social democracy ( liberal democracies can turn into social democracies with a single election , and vice versa ) are both * by far * the most effective , fair and ethical forms of government that humanity has discovered so far . 
  i do n't think its `` an eye for an eye '' i think its more like `` you took my eye , so i 'm going to take my eye back . 
  you can keep both of yours , but i want mine back . '', 
  klitschko is what is accepted by the english speaking world as the english version . 
  although i think klychko is the more proper anglisized version , they seem to prefer klitschko . 
  english really doesnt give a fuck about spelling though , we all know that . 
  it allowed the use of russian , but not other minority languages . 
  was n't the russian language forced upon the ukrainians during soviet times ? 
  so is n't this just a return to the historical precedent ? 
  i mean , if the germans would have imposed german on vichy france , i would support the `` re-frenchification '' of the vichy french . 
  edit : fyi i just learned that yulia tymoshenko is a native russian speaker . 
  okay , very interesting and i am glad that you got to have your say . 
  i think is also a lot of truth in your comment . 
  but as far as germany undermining the us for russia and china , i do need to point out that the germans are extremely afraid of the russians . 
  there are missiles based in kaliningrad that are very close to germany , there is also something called the `` north european plain '' which is an extension of the eurasian steppe that runs from russia all the way through to northern germany ( and arguably all the way through the netherlands , belgium and northern france ) . 
  the north european plain does not have any major natural geographical barriers , so historically it was very very easy for invading armies to rush through the plain in a matter of no time . 
  this has resulted in a very very very very long history of fast and total invasions through this plain . 
  going all the way back to pre-roman times . 
  napoleon used it , hitler used it , stalin used it , attila the hun used it , charlemagne used it , so on and so forth . 
  now , in the modern age this may not matter as much , but the history behind it has left a very profound imprint on german culture and the german worldview . 
  also , you may think the germans are being too friendly with the russians , but i assure you this is just so they can get close enough to put a dagger in their heart . 
  ( and by their heart ; i mean the heart of their corrupt regime ), 
  i really do love npr , one of the best news media organizations in the world honestly . 
  very thoughtful , insightful , and has a very european worldview in my opinion . 
  wait , there was an attack on us soil that was orchestrated from al-qaeda & the taliban , which made up the de-facto government of afghanistan .
