  attack on nato member soil by foreign government = nato action against attacker . 
  and the bombings in spain and britain were orchestrated by al qaeda which was based in afghanistan . 
  this is the nature of nato . 
  russian soldier steps on foot on estonian soil , all nato nations are at war with russia . 
  afghan taliban attacks nyc , nato is at war with afghan taliban, 
  i do n't buy it , europe is not like canada with only 35 million people ; ** we are very powerful ** both economically , culturally and potentially militarily . 
  and like it or not , afghanistan was nato stuff . 
  we did have a duty to fulfill our nato obligations to the usa to help them defeat the enemy that attacked their soil on 9/11 . 
  i do n't get it since world power usa has been humiliated time and time again ... 
  i do n't think they care what the rest of world ( outside of uk ) thinks of them . 
  i honestly do n't . 
  call the usa terrorists , fascists , criminals , imperialists they do n't care they 're just like `` whatever bro , i 'm awesome . '', 
   partly as a result of pressure from the us yes , eveything you disagree with is the result of pressure from the us ... 
  i think we use this kind of talk bit too much in europe . 
  france and germany maybe the most . 
  us does n't have that much power over the eu . 
  the eu is very powerful , largest economy on earth and if it wanted to it could have the largest , most powerful military on earth too . 
  what did the last bundesprez say and how did people react ? 
  considering the fact that the ukrainian people are not at all to blame , and that yanukovych and his cronies were so utterly corrupt , i think we need to help . 
  its the only just course of action . 
  edit : maybe take the money from the defense budgets ? 
  seriously , this is a good investment in defense for sure . 
  is this the ukrainian version of `` vive la france '' ? 
  edit : vive l'ukraina !, 
  okay , denmark is a plutocracy too . 
  denmark , the us , russia and china are all plutocracies . 
  ... denmark , russia and china are all plutocracies . 
  ... denmark is a plutocracy like china . 
  hey man , why would say something like that ? 
  we know people have sacrificed their lives for europe before , but not under the eu flag . 
  this does kind of mean something significant for a lot of us . 
  why do n't you go read about wwii and then come back and tell me you feel the same way about the european union flag . 
  this union has united us together , when just a few decades ago we were carpet bombing each other 's cities . 
  us has a lot of income disparity for one nation , but the eu has only a slightly larger economy and also has a slightly higher rate of income disparity . 
  us also does currently have a system that favors the wealthy and makes it challenging to move up the social ladder . 
  however , it is no where near the same as russia and china . 
  in china , the vast majority of elites are descendants of soldiers who fought alongside chairman mao , this is bizarrely similar to medieval european aristocracy ( i.e. 
  the contemporary english nobility are mostly descendants of knights who rode with william of normandy ) . 
  the us is not this way . 
  russian elites almost exclusively served the ussr communist party , or cashed in on the corrupt self-off of soviet assets during the yeltsin years . 
  the us is not this way either . 
  do n't classify the us with russia and china . 
  its not accurate . 
  they invaded the nation of tibet and annexed it . 
  quite right . 
  and if europe has a respectable military then the americans will probably become less paranoid which will presumably result in them being less hawkish . 
  i mean think in the future when/if china fully modernizes its military - theres no way that china would ever try to start trouble if it knew that both the us and europe had superpower level militaries . 
  also , we europeans have demonstrated time and time again that we are dedicated to maintaining world peace . 
  we are pretty much number one in that regards . 
  the us is also dedicated to world peace , but their philosophy on how to acheive this peace too often includes force . 
  we would counter balance that , in a friendly way . 
  idk if that 's a good idea for clegg ... farage 's ideology may be deeply flawed , but the man spits fire whenever he speaks in public . 
  the economist says that ukraine is neither `` east nor west '' i disagree , i think it is west . 
  therefore , by your equation , i am a putinist . 
   they are worse than russia no they are not . 
  honestly i just stopped reading your comment after that part , i have had enough of putin apologists . 
  they all have the same script with the same talking points that they use to steer attention away from the issue at hand . 
  so over it . 
  i think i 've had just enough of the putinist point of view , it always has a convenient excuse to explain away every little criticism of the kremlin and its policies . 
  silly dalmatian , thats probably only a 1 and half hour flight, 
  you 're a brit . 
  you live on britain . 
  you 're a brit . 
  ** poland and germany 's geopolitical interests are almost perfectly aligned ** , do not mistake tusk 's calculated actions as being made by merkel . 
  he is not a puppet , he is simply performing in the best interest of poland . 
  which coincidentally also in the best interest of germany . 
  i like that it described kyiv as being at the heart of europe . 
  i like that a lot . 
  quite right , people forget that there is actually a very , very large amount of russians who are liberal and intellectual ; but they are too frightened to speak out because the fsb has complete and total invasive reach . 
  it is putin and his fsb that are holding back russian intellectuals from charging forward and creating a modern , dynamic russia . 
  i * knew * a spaniard was going to reply to me . 
  but i am certain things will improve , little adjusts will need to be made . 
  but the fundamentals of spanish society are strong . 
  if you do n't want to read the whole thing , at the very least jump to the `` outlook '' section at the bottom . 
  things are starting to get better for europe , slowly , but still getting better !, 
  i personally am optimistic about the future and about the future of the european union . 
  well yes in the western world they do , but i do n't know if they do in the east , middleeat or asia . 
  so i thought i 'd clarify for readers from there . 
  i sent this to my grand-papa and he replied * `` i have n't seen that look on a european face since the war '' * edit : my grand-papa always refers to wwii as the `` the war '' as if it were the only war that ever happened, 
  poor kids , theyre probably pretty a bit brainwashed and radicalized themselves . 
  i recall that a few weeks ago when the violence started , mothers in the west refused to let their national guard sons go to the protests . 
  those were good mothers , they were doing a good thing protecting their sons from being used as pawns . 
  so , this is what immediately came to my mind after i read your comment . 
  some parts of the usa are like germany while other parts are like portugal ? 
  is that the right range ? 
  because i 'd say in europe the very best is norway and the very worst is moldova . 
  germany is like pretty damn good but not norway perfect and portugal is dumpy and poor but not krokodil poor like moldova . 
  yea i like that . 
  you 've been reading too much galeano . 
  75 % of american gdp is generated via internal trade i.e. 
  different states and cities trade with each other . 
  only 25 % of us gdp is from external trade . 
  half of that external trade is with canada and mexico . 
  another huge portion is with europe , and another with china . 
  so at the end of the day , the us actually conducts very little trade with third world countries . 
  bankrupt , yet also the wealthiest places on earth . 
  how ????? 
  personally , i think that we often do n't associate the us with social progress because they are always extremely critical of themselves with regards to social progress . 
  combine that with their cultural reach and you end up with their own self-criticism being exported to other societies . 
  i mean just think , most americans on / r/worldnews would have you believe that the usa is now a stalinist police state because of nsa and patriot act .
