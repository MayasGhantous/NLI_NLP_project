  even moderates decry it as a loss of ` liberty . ', 
  in reality , the patriot act is actually a bit milder than many european laws on the same subject . 
  edit : god it is a country of paradoxes , they really do hate on america an awful lot . 
  i am certain that almost all american stereotypes were invented by americans ... and yet they are also very very ` murica at the same time . 
  they shit on themselves almost as much as they `` toot their own horn . '', 
  abc news and bbc news have livestreams as well . 
  abc news has a better livestream though . 
  american abc news not australian abc news [ abc news livestream ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/live?stream=1 ), 
  yea but even so , the us is one of the lesser offenders ... do n't forget about [ ** this ** ] ( http://api.ning.com/files/q2pgbt4p8k3pmqge1tvefa*q5xia5mlc5k3fegvx7mxvwqxvpszygpuurklcyxknovdqtevvyfq619upxvhyn7rej3btju2g/africa1914.jpg ) and [ ** this ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/map_of_the_empire_of_japan_after_1932.png ) and [ ** this ** ] ( http://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/168/flashcards/940168/png/warsaw_pact1363892749722.png ) and [ ** fucking this ** ] ( http://www.atlasofbritempire.com/uploads/be_annexation_1.png ), 
  their society has a remarkable ability to adapt and to change , just think that when obama was born he was legally considered to be a second class citizen ( because he 's black ) in half of the country and then in 2008 he was elected president . 
  also his middle name is hussein . 
  these are quite amazing considering the huge population and the diversity of the population . 
   that someone in the us ( defense/intelligence agencies ) would n't be casting a weary eye upon the situation well , but casting a weary eye upon the situation seems like a sensible response . 
  just let them embarrass themselves but keep an eye on them in case they try to poison somebody with polonium or something . 
  i hate to say it , but 2/3rds of those interventions were actually morally just . 
  i really dont think so , they would be on the colbert report and daily shows instead of on cnn or abc . 
  canada is a very stable country , people are not going to upset the fundmental order of their country because some lunatic politicians are running around trying to incite the canadian people to rebel against their government . 
  just really , think about that for second . 
  politicians from authoritarian governments are trying to convince canadians to overthrow their democratic government and go without the generous welfare support provided by said government . 
  i understand your alarm , but i disagree . 
  and if russian mps or chinese or iranians were in the middle of washington d.c. or paris or brussels ; i do n't think western governments would care . 
  no one would really take them seriously , they would be ridiculed by almost everyone . 
  people would see them in the same light as usa westboro baptist church people . 
  [ they are actually this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ygg3ry.jpg?1 ), 
  ukraine is not divided as in the way you think it is . 
  in the west and center there are massive protests against the government . 
  in the east there is silence . 
  they do not passionately support the government , they are passive and mostly indifferent . 
  this is not republicans vs democrats or shia vs sunni ; this is more akin to an abused dog that bites back vs an abused dog that passively rolls over . 
  those people are religious radicals though , that guy is probably a christian extremist of some sort . 
  do n't compare what i was talking about to a false flag operation , i was talking about countering russian interference with american aid . 
  which is perfectly reasonable . 
  and its funny that you bring up false flag operations , because thats exactly what yanukovych 's titushki are doing . 
  i 'm sure they 've got a more powerful system that they wo n't share with the public . 
  i feel like that happens a lot with military technology . 
  you are talking out of your ass because the americans are in intense trade talks with the russian and have been for the past decade . 
  the us does n't really give a fuck about its own hegemony , if russia enters a free-trade agreement then russia will enter western hegemony . 
  thats what american business people care about . 
  3 , japan . 
  and those 3 were big-time countries with big populations and big economies . 
  honestly , the equivalent would be like bringing real , stable democracy to contemporary russia and china, 
  well , all besides spain , portugal and greece ... and honestly back in those times they were pretty insignificant in a geopolitical sense . 
  what planet do you live on ? 
  hatred from the japanese , i 'm pretty sure the us and japan are still close allies and that japan has a high opinion of the us . 
  also , you got less enemies . 
  you gained friends in west germany and japan ... those are pretty significant friends to gain . 
  berkut animals, 
  `` voted by '' the ukrainians . 
  `` elected '' in an `` election . '', 
  world war ii brought peace and democracy to all of western europe and democracy to japan . 
  [ the laws anti-drone anti-rocket laser system ] ( http://youtu.be/dl9_tldmrhs ) recall that lasers travel at the speed of light , so they are extremely effective at targeting and destroying rockets/missiles as they are much , much slower than the speed of light . 
  [ apparently the usa just deployed a ship with such laws capabilities into the persian gulf ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-navy-to-deploy-futuristic-military-laser-to-persian-gulf/ ) the article was posted 8 hours ago . 
  terrorists were a different kind of enemy than nation states . 
  if russia invaded ukraine , and then the us went in and ousted russia , they would be greated as liberators . 
  it would be more like the liberation of france from the nazis in wwii than of the liberation of aghanistan from the taliban in 2003 . 
  there would probably be victory parades and ukrainian women throwing themselves at us soldiers . 
  okay thats fair . 
  why is this not okay , wikileaks was doing something illegal . 
  have we gotten to the point were the authorities no longer have the right to respond to legitimate criminal behavior ? 
  i 'm not making a comment on whether wikileaks is good or bad , i 'm simply saying that it does break the law . 
  and visitors to the site generally break the law when they submit content , i 'm sure they monitored silk road too and other sites that offer illegal services . 
  just like keep an eye on shady establishments , like suspected illegal brothels or the houses of suspected drug dealers . 
  while they need a warrant to search the drug dealers house , they dont need one to park across the street and watch who enters the drug dealers house . 
  i care . 
  its a conflict bordering several nato countries . 
  if it spills over , the us goes to war . 
  full blown war . 
  its in the us interest to end the situation before that . 
  in the first video , those are titushki . 
  i just read a thing saying that the men in hunter green helmats are titushkis, 
   russian t-90 's are rolling through the german lowlands this is not something that could ever happen . 
  nato forces will have established control from volgograd to vladivostok before a single russian tank entered eu territory . 
  russia is already involved . 
  heavily . 
  democracy and the rule of law would already be well-rooted in ukraine if it were n't for constant , significant russian interference . 
  the us can do things , when the arab spring was happening did n't the usa use some kind of advanced tech to reopen the internet and twitter after the arab govs shut off internet access ? 
  also , maybe give the protestors intel about where berkut are , so they can prepare for an oncoming assault . 
  things like this . 
  idk shes a desperate ukrainian facing an authoritarian regime that poses overwhelming technological and physical force . 
  i think its probably like asking god for help , she doesnt know if it will come but just asking makes her feel more secure . 
  how about waking up and realizing that this website is corrupt ? 
  you gon na go broke if you move to london . 
  dublins like london but cheaper ? 
  idk im french and never been to london or dublin . 
  seems odd to me , i would expect americans to have somesort of special status along with other industrialized nations . 
  maybe the ttip will change this ? 
  see i like people like that . 
  these people may be a bit backwards and poor-mannered , but they have a certain genuine charisma that gives them a special place in my mind . 
  you know , that is probably how peasants of the french countryside acted ( except without smartphones ) . 
  back in the day little villages could be just as isolated from mainstream france , and developed just as peculiar accents . 
  i get the feeling that aussies can just fly here and do shit . 
  feel like that applies to canadians , americans and kiwis too . 
  idk , but that feels right . 
  ireland . 
  no , no , no , no dont do london do dublin, 
  you have just revealed the toxic bias of the wsws . 
  the movement promoted by the us and germany pales in comparison to the intrenched , systemic influence that russia has in ukraine . 
  make no mistake , moscow calls the shots in ukraine , not kiev . 
  the russian bear has its fangs wrapped around ukraine 's throat , eager to bite down . 
  the west wants to change that and a majority of ukrainians want change as well - an almost total majority in western ukraine and a sizable minority in eastern ukraine .
