  there is ** no way ** an unbiased , educated , compassionate , left-wing source would oppose the euromaidan . 
  its has very aggressively attacked the euromaidan protests , in a way that makes no sense for a socialist website . 
  such a website should be supporting a peoples revolt against oligarchic rule . 
  i do n't trust that website . 
  acadiens and cajuns . 
  and holy fuck , the cajuns are the greatest people on earth . 
  they live in the bayous and hunt alligators !, 
  very charming people , in a rustic sort of way . 
  ignorant and uncouth , but charming nonetheless . 
  you should know , that this website receives considerable funding from the kremlin . 
  as does globalresearch.ca be careful with these websites , tread lightly and do n't let them make you too emotional and angry . 
  edit : do an experiment , put `` russia '' into the search function to see what the site has written about russia . 
  you will finding nothing critical or negative . 
  all of the articles relating to russia paint it as the victim of the usa and eu , and as the defender of the world against western imperialism . 
  no , not really . 
  wikipedia says greeks have been in cyprus since the second century bc , so over 2,000 years . 
  i am sure that the greeks in sicily/southern italy have been there for the same amount of time . 
  so , since they both speak a greek dialect , how is it that the greeks of cyprus are more greek than the 80,000 greeks in southern italy ? 
  what makes them more greek ? 
  that they have their own nation ? 
  i do n't think thats reasonable . 
  i think the greeks of southern italy are just as greek as the greeks of cyprus . 
  little bubbles of france can be found throughout the americas, 
  haha yes , when they become so geographically isolated from the rest of civilization , entire communities develop goofy idiosyncrasies and particularities . 
  of course you feel culturally closer to french citizens than to qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois . 
  the thing is , their society sprung from france . 
  this means something . 
  the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is what you get when you take bunch of french people , plant them in north america and wait a century or so . 
  have you been to qu\u00e9bec ? 
  i have and they are actually quite similar to us , just a bit more `` hick . '', 
  i suppose there is something about the north american continent that makes people a little bit more red-neck like . 
  they are still charming in their own way , though . 
  edit : i am a history buff though , so historical connection are very significant for me . 
  edit2 : and ethnicity only means something to me because it means their ancestors helped shape french culture , society , territory , they fought and died for france and the french people . 
  again , i consider history to be very important , so that is why i see these things as significant . 
  see , i think you are looking at them and their cultural traits to judge how irish they are . 
  they are looking at ireland and irish history , not modern irish culture , to judge how irish they are and how irish you are . 
  they do not look at ireland and see the modern culture , with poles and euros and football statistics . 
  they are looking at ireland as the land of celts , druids , high-kings , viking raiders , english oppression , the catholic church , yeats , joyce , wilde , the cemetery of their ancestors etc they have a different definition of irishness , one that is tied to the past not the present . 
  and thats okay really , good for ireland to have a special place in the hearts and minds of so many people . 
  in the most pragmatic sense , its good for pr and tourism . 
   hey now battle against equality between men and women fuckheads . 
  angela , why ? 
  greece is being a good boy right now , being relatively financially responsible . 
  i say it would be a good investment for germany . 
   the question was about how qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are seen okay , i see where you come from . 
  but i think we should change the way they are seen . 
  same with francophone africa and other francophone places ( but to a lesser extent than with the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois , because they are ethnically french too not just linguistically ) . 
  its nice to focus on the similarities and not the differences . 
  it gives me `` warm and fuzzies '' to think that way . 
  i 'm a fan of the french diaspora . 
  kind of source of pride really , i can pretend that the french empire still exists , in a way . 
  i see qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois , acadiens , and cajuns as closer relatives than italians , spaniards and portuguese . 
  and i think most french people see the italians , spaniards and portuguese as `` cousins . '', 
  so i guess that makes those north americans like , idk sons and daughters ? 
   irish-americans are still pretty stuck in the past in regards to irish nationalism that makes sense though , its like their irish identity is frozen to the era when their ancestor left ireland , back when the english still ruled . 
  oh stop the emotional blah blah blah , you sound like a little boy . 
  anyway , i was only telling people to be nice and respectful . 
  i do n't think that makes me an asshole . 
  also , not a `` dude '', 
  oh , there are idiot tourists everywhere . 
  they have come to your country to undo that caricature and to learn more about your country in depth . 
  every moment they spend in scotland they soak up more of the real scotland . 
  do n't be a douche to them , be a nice guy who helps them soak up more scotland . 
  oh my , they are tourists on holiday they are not interested in the nitty gritty details of what it means to be ` scottish . ', 
  they love scotland in a special way , so let them make their song and dance . 
  and if the clan system was largely invented by the victioans , tell them that !, 
  they did n't know that but theyre eagerly to learn about their history . 
  they are not your fellow countrymen , your fellow countrymen are you brothers and sisters . 
  your diaspora are your cousins . 
  i mean , the french see italians and spaniards as `` our cousins '' so how could we not see cajuns or qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as our cousins too ? 
   but these greeks were seen as greeks . 
  they were seen as lesser by the greeks in ancient greece . 
  also they spoke different dialects of greek . 
  some of those diaspora communities were separate from greece for hundreds , even thousands of years . 
  i think there are even still some small communities in southern italy that speak greek or a form of greek . 
  edit : ancient greece, 
  yes i think thats true to certain extent . 
  that is purely genetic though , while qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have both genetic and cultural , religious , and linguistic roots with france . 
  edit : yes religious roots too , the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are actually quite a bit more catholic than those in france . 
  still pretty secular , but less so than the french . 
  you disgust me . 
  edit : okay you do n't disgust me , the wording was a bit strong . 
  but do n't call them strangers . 
  thats not very fun . 
  you do n't feel pride about being scottish from the fact that these people are so interested and proud of their own history theyre will to travel thousands of km across the atlantic just to learn about scotland ? 
  really ? 
  i think you 're viewpoint is unhealthy . 
  i think this is the healthier way to look at it , we should always try to find ways to find similarities to people around the world , not try to find differences . 
  i have a friend who is from cameroon ( a part of francophone africa ) , she says she has a french grandfather and she will say that she is french even though she is only 1/4 french . 
  my response to that is `` of course you are french , welcome back ! '', 
  after all , she certainly has ancestors that fought and died to protect france , so in honor of them i have to accept her as french . 
  francophone belgians and swiss ** are not ** part of the french diaspora because they are living in their ancestral homelands . 
  qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ** are ** part of the french diaspora because they are not living in their ancestral homelands . 
  they do n't know the definition of diaspora . 
  i think you 're not understanding the meaning of diaspora . 
  it is very specific word that refers to a people who have set up a society in a place other than their ancestral homeland . 
  not to the relationship between the societies in the present . 
  most qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have france as their ancestral homeland , so they are indeed part of the french diaspora . 
  yes , of course .
