  just as germany 's business community became hooked on nord stream gas . 
  then , when russia makes it 's moves in eastern europe , it will be able to call upon italian , austrian and french business communities to lobby against any harsh moves to counter the kremlin . 
  ** they are trying to split us , so that they will be able to reassert their hegemony in the east without the west intervening . 
  well ... you should be because then geert wilders , marine le pen and nigel farage will pick on albanians ( eastern european and muslims ) instead of bulgarians and romanians . 
  the spies have confirmed that they spy ... 
  well , that 's a shame . 
  she would 've been a stellar commission president . 
  on the bright side , this means she 'll have the time to set up her campaign to become the next president of france !, 
   ethnic russian insurgency in the east . 
  this is a real , grassroots ethnic uprising , yea i just stopped reading after this sentence . 
  there is a massive amount of evidence that points to kremlin instigation of the conflict , not the least of which is that shipment of russian weapons into eastern ua that was intercepted . 
  and then there 's the brutalizing and murder of local , low lever elected officials ( such as city council people ), 
   forced voa of the air and even worse , they forces radio free europe / radio liberty off the air , which in my mind is not really a propaganda outlet but rather a quality source on the region, 
   the uk ... benefit from the financial chaos in europe ya but this is a french op-ed for a french audience so he had to add some fiery accusation against the english , true or not ;-), 
   ... is in any position to criticize france on this matter everyone everywhere is in a position to criticize france for this . 
  even north korea ... this is a horrifying betrayal of ukrainians , moldovans , poles , balts , romanians , bulgarians , finns and swedes . 
  of course , a big chunk of the blame lies on nato allies for not stepping up and buying the ships . 
  ** france 's economy needs the revenue , ** thousands of people are employed in the construction of such a ship and failure to sell the ships could possibly result in the ** ship building company going out of business ( which would severely hurt france 's arms industry and lessen her technological edge ) . 
  ** it would be far too big a blow to let the sale fall through . 
  ** however ** , as i said before , this is not appropriate and should not be happening because ** the eu or nato should step up to the plate and help us out . 
  ** ( and i do n't mean the us since they already spend $ 600 billion per year on defense ... so really ** europe needs to step up ** ) . 
  edit : inglish prawblimz, 
  people who dislike lagarde are shit heads . 
  she 's already proven herself time and time again to be capable and to hold egalitarian yet fiscally pragmatic values . 
  in fact she is one of the few centre-right politicians to say that egalitarianism * is itself a pragmatic fiscal value . 
  * this one has a good head on her shoulders and she would be a capable commission president and , god willing , she would be a great president of the republic as well . 
  * look at me , i 'm so edgy . 
  i stand against america *, 
  oh god blah , so much gringo hostility , but they have a point in many respects , but what will happen is a internal reforms in france ( see the consolidation of french regions from 22 to 14 that is planned by hollander and valls , i expect more reforms of this ilk and i hope that they increase in their comprehensiveness ) france will not leave the eu and it will not abandon the european project , instead it will undergo internal reforms to compete . 
  as for the wine thing ... who the fuck cares , it 's wine . 
  it 's not like we are absolutely hostile to every single product that is not french . 
  far from it . 
  ah fuck , even the swiss have a cyber warfare command ?? 
  what 's next , a liechtenstein cyber command ? 
  i do n't recall the industrial espionage being credibly reported by anyone other than the silly shit-heads at * bild *, 
  it 's not at all . 
  i recall reading a german headline where former au\u00dfenminister guido westerwelle called for a `` bundnisbruch '' the day after the merkel-handy aff\u00e4re broke . 
  iirc , bundnisbruch means `` alliance break '' ... obviously he did a 180 after the initial outrage in germany went down and even went on cnn and was saying that the `` fundementals of our friendship are strong '' or something . 
  but even with the 180 change , calling for a * bundnisbruch * over the whole thing was pretty outrageous, 
   eastern territories except everyone there is a far-lefty russophile, 
  i 'm tempted to condemn this ... 
  but kyiv needs to defeat these russian insurgents asap . 
  more lives will be lost if anarchy in the donbas is n't checked . 
   do you ever stop to think for a moment no he does not . 
   me me me attitude fuckin ' gringos , always on about `` muh rights , muh freedumbs , muh liburdees '' from the the frozen arctic to the scorching outback ; from pluvial cornwall to sunny arizona ... * ( it 's funny because they stole these lands from the inuits , aborigines , celts and navajo . 
  they are so mysterious to me , almost a little magical . 
  guiana is bigger than switzerland but only has 250,000 people , is covered in dense rainforest , still has some uncontacted indigenous tribes but its main economic engine is the uber-high tech european space agency !, 
  italians need to be inspired . 
  the need hero to bring them out of the dark post-berlusconi , post - ` boring old financial crisis men ' era, 
  til french guianeans are commies, 
  the uk can into political diversity . 
  its a good thing, 
  that 's brilliant , spot on name for a european battleship, 
   globalization is destroying communities , decreasing living standards and hollowing out democratic institutions . 
  do n't blame it on globalization , blame it on the financial crisis which was a problem * because * it interrupted the growth caused by globalization . 
  man , so many third worlders have been lifted out of crushing poverty because of globalization ... there 's bad shit to globalization but there was bad shit before globalization i for one , do not want europe to be left behind as asia and america charge forward . 
  we should learn from the fate of imperial china , how they were the most powerful , wealthy and advanced civilization on earth since the collapse of rome . 
  and they got complacent , fell behind and were dominated by foreigners for centuries, 
  and this is old norse , ~ ~ not a modern scandinavian language , correct ? ~ ~ it 's a term in icelandic , but that 's basically old norse . 
  anyways , it 's still a badass name . 
  i thought if was a good idea that we have a southern european named one and a northern european names one . 
  right now , there is one true superpower in this world and it alone exercises tremendous influence over europe . 
  it will not be long until there are many superpowers : china , india , brazil , and other powers that have not yet registered on our radar . 
  we need not federate , but reforms are needed to secure european prosperity and to ensure that they never are able to do to us * what we did to them * ... * we need a common foreign policy * we need a common defense force ; especially a common navy * no country should be allowed to secede the union . 
  once you 're in , you 're in for keeps . 
  edit : missing verbz, 
  okay , what 's his relation to the ocean ? 
  * eus mare nostrum * and * eus s\u00e6konungar * edit : s\u00e6konungar = sea-king in old norse edit : in case you did n't notice , one is named in honor of latin / mediterranean europe 's naval history and the other in honor of northern / germanic europe 's naval history, 
   which also is n't in anyone 's best interests i think you mean `` the forces of evil and tyranny '' instead of `` anyone . '', 
  such a silly typo, 
  i 'd be okay with brasil becoming the p6 , but india can not be . 
  because then pakistan will want to be , and saudi arabia and iran and so on and so forth . 
  i 'd really only be okay with brasil , japan and germany becoming p6 , p7 and p8 ... but once we start offering permanent seats , a pandora 's box will be opened . 
  human civilization was born from empires , from babylonian to siouan to songhai to french . 
  the whole nation-state thing is relatively new , and for most non-western nations , it 's even newer . 
  edit : go ahead call a greek disgusting for be proud of the achievements of the athenian , spartan and macedonian empires . 
  or a chinese he 's disgusting for being proud of the han or tang empires . 
  from what i 've heard , turkish cypriots are very secular ... 
  if that 's the case just unite and get on with it , if there 's a linguistic snafu just have english be the language of state . 
  it may not be pc , but a secular turk is quite european in nature . 
  well they 're extremely similar . 
  just think , you see the english as foreigners and they see the irish as foreigners , even though scots are similar to english and northern irish are similar to irish . 
  so it 's to be reasoned that there are some very rigid `` ethnic standards '' in both groups . 
  well they 're both fanatic nationalists , i assumed they have the same xenophobia, 
  same thing . 
  and it probably happened in scotland too , we just did n't hear about it . 
  woah , settle down buddy . 
  people take pride in that crap everywhere , and it okay as long as you do n't cross certain lines . 
  shit , even the mongolians have chinggis khan on their money . 
  did n't the scots chase out that chinese from public office ? 
  scared her of to england or something, 
  then say good bye to the un at least now we can intervene in areas where a p5 member does n't have a big interest, 
  russia kept its ... you 're keeping yours , and we are keeping ours . 
  if people have a problem with that , they can kiss my icbm-mounted nuclear ( arse ) nal . 
  yea , the germanified french ( aka regermanified latinized germanics ... ) are blessed to not share a supercontinent with the ravenous hordes of eurasia . 
  easy to rule the world when you only need a superpowered navy and a modest army as opposed to needing a superpowered navy and a superpowered army ... 
  something something global power for the past 700 years despite small population and geographic handicap something something, 
  well my country could beat up your country !, 
  looks like it ... 
  well ... at least we 're not fat ;-) edit : [ and theeen you compare just the rich countries , and then factor in social egalitarianism and western europe looks a lot better ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wz05ebe.jpg ),
