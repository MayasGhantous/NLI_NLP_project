   it 'd be like the usa losing new york or some other important state ( s ) on the east coast , but keeping washington . 
  better analogy is spain losing catalonia . 
  because the us example does n't factor in ethnic and linguistic differences . 
  theres been a solid independence movement in ukraine for a long while , like catalonia . 
  yea , it do n't got no breadbasket !, 
  also , i heard a commentator say that ukraine was the crown jewel of the russian / soviet empires ; playing much the same function for russia as india played for britain . 
  without it , the empire is a husk of its former self . 
  here 's the deal : countries based around a common ethnicity can not handle levels of immigrants over a certain percentage because it starts to tear a the social fabric , our leaders need to recognize this and act accordingly . 
  we are not like the usa or canada who are blessed with the gift to assimilate peoples of disparate ethnicities into the dominant culture . 
  11 million immigrants from mexico alone . 
  over 25 million continental european immigrants from 1880 to 1900 . 
  25 million in 20 yea , all from completely different ethnicities ; from polish to sicilian . 
  this is insane numbers european nations simply can not do this . 
  i 've been wondering why and my best answers are that : * millions and millions of our forefathers died to preserve our territory for our given ethnicities . 
  the land of each of our countries is soaked with the blood of men , and slaughtered women , who stood their ground to keep france french or hungary hungarian . 
  this has had a profound impact on our psyches as nations , as enlightened and as modern as we are ; we ca n't turn our backs on that sacrifice . 
  ukraine , what a victory for europe . 
  obviously it 's not win yet , but you better believe that if euromaidan would n't have happened , yanukovych 's name would be listed in this article with lukashenka , nazerbayev , and putin . 
  it 's for soundbites aka 10-30 sec clips that a news castor can interject into a broadcast segment to make a quick point . 
  america ... 
  runs on soundbites ... 
  source : went to skewl there, 
  i like dis map . . , europe has no borders until you got russia . 
  i hope i can see the eu expand to such before i die ( minskmaidan will be required , though ) edit : and finland has reconquered karelia !, 
  i want you to look back on history and assess ; how many countries / times had ireland been invaded and conquered ? 
  how many times has poland been invaded and conquered ? 
  additionally , would you personally be willing to die for poland would you personally be willing to send your country men to die for poland ? 
  europe does not need the usa to defend itself ; both britain and france are nuclear powers . 
  what europe needs is american help defending its interests far across the globe because we have been small countries ever since the two world wars bankrupted and raped the shit out of our empires . 
   they 're as likely to run into trouble as we are are for real right now ? 
  ireland has one real potential threat : the uk and with a second potential threat in the making : scotland . 
  poland is in a much more dicey situation, 
  having the united states as an ally vs not having the united states as an ally . 
  what do you choose ? 
  yes , that 's right because you 're a reasonable person you chose `` having the united states as an ally '' because $ 600 billion annual defense budget ; that 's why . 
  i 'm gon na need to start a lot more fuck ups than just afghanistan and iraq in order for me to consider ditching nato, 
  well , tiny part of me hopes he goes all out and reinstates full blown feudalism , ditches the suit for some exquisite renaissance finery , builds a series of mighty castles and issues noble titles to the belarusian elite . 
  i 'd probably visit belarus to see this play out , provided that they do n't burn me at the stake for secularism . 
   non existent spectre have you just woken up from hibernation ? 
  have you not heard about what happen with russia and a sovereign nation this winter / spring ? 
  yes ... 
  the guy who lives on an island way the fuck out in the atlantic , second only to iceland in terms of distance from russia , is attacking the guy who lives in a country on the flat , indefensible northern european plain , that is just a stones throw away from 15 000 russian tanks in belarus and hundreds of iskander missiles in kaliningrad . 
  okay guy , why do n't you look at this from the eastern european perspective for a second and you 'll understand the reality of situation . 
  okay mr gibraltar , why do n't we let the eastern europeans guide our russian policy , okay ? 
  they 're kind of experts . 
   maintains an odd rivalry with nato wait , what ?? 
  do n't they compliment each other ? 
  anyways , sikorski is polish and americans love the polish so it would work out between eu and nato . 
  i mean poland loves the whole democracy and liberty thing so it share that with the us ( we all share his one ) but then poland is also pretty darn catholic and the us is still pretty darn christian ; so they share that value too . 
  and then they both like to be tough on their enemies , i.e. 
  i kind of feel like poland is to russia what japan is to china : a smaller , yet still formidable , country that is bolstered by american support . 
  iirc the polish have a concept called ` polonia ' which basically means that they continue cherish americans of polish descent and see them as having a special place in the polish * ethnos * , despite not being fully culturally / linguistically polish . 
  which is a fairly unique cultural value that bodes well for bilateral relations . 
  -------- * sikorski is married to an american woman !, 
  who is jewish !, 
  ( she converted to catholicism though ) . 
  she is an editor at * the economist * , * the washington post * and * slate * . 
  so she has some hot-shot connections in the usa and the uk . 
  she was also awarded the `` cross of terra mariana '' the highest honor ** estonia ** confer to foreigners . 
  hungary also gave her a high honor . 
  the sikorskis are an interesting family . 
   ~ ~ americanisation ~ ~ globalisation you do know that you 're english , right ? 
  you do know that it was your country that started this whole globalisation thing by having the empire thing ? 
  this is your sphere of influence too you son of a bitch wow , it really grinds my gears when brits are all upset about `` america 's hegemony '' blah blah you guys have a pretty fucking good deal : * you 're empire basically still exists , and its because american naval power reinforces its integrity ( i 'm talking about 5 eyes ) . 
  * london has enormous influence in washington , probably more than new york does . 
  if i recall correctly , did n't president reagan call margaret thatcher to get her approval before he sent commandos to grenada ? 
  and do you remember a while back when obama , cameron and hollande agreed to shoot some missiles at assad ? 
  france endoresed it , we were already to go !, 
  obama was ready for it ... and then cameron brought it up to parliament who shot it down and then , holy fuck obama magically changes his mind the next day . 
  and france was like `` america , we are ready to go !, 
  but we ca n't afford to do it alone . '', 
  and obama just pushed it under the rug . 
  basically saying that he did n't give a shit about what france wanted , only what britain wanted . 
  * how 's that whole english as a global language doing for ya ? 
  you enjoying that ? 
  because your language is the dominant language because the united states took over as global hegemon from britain , perpetuating english 's dominance * britain has enormous soft power that is amplified through america 's soft power . 
  there are probably school children in fucking north korea reading shakespeare right now ( and if not , there sure as hell are in south korea ) . 
  lord of the rings , the hobbit , james bond , fucking downton abbey , planet earth , david attenborough ... why are all of those such huge internationally recognized brands ?? 
  because america , thats why . 
  the market for british cultural products is massive , so there is correspondingly a massive amount of finance available for british artists and that leads to awesome cultural products that they non-english speaking world loves too . 
  * i do n't mean to be offensive , but the dutch king is not a global figure . 
  danish king , swedish king , norwegian king , belgian king , spanish king ... nobody knows who these are . 
  go to japan , no one will know these monarchs ... but if you ask them if they know who camila parker-bowles is they will say `` duchess of cornwarru ! '', 
  prince harry is everywhere . 
  kate middleton has a baby and everyone freaks the fuck out ... jesus , give me a break . 
  article about russian president vladimir putin ? 
  how should i respond ? 
  i know !, 
  i 'll criticize the usa and make a list of bad things the usa has done !, 
   leave nato have you gone mad ? 
  listen , i know the us is not a hardcore peacenik nation like denmark but my god man its a fantastic ally to have, 
  and is n't that wonderful ? 
  because if you guys did n't < 3 us and we did n't < 3 you back another 50 million people would probably die ... again . 
  that 's why i 'm saying that they are a force to be reckoned with on land . 
  okay , 10 billion dollars, 
  also anyone remember how russia spent ** $ 50 billion on the olympics ** to impress the world and show how modern russia is ... and then they ** completely reversed that good will ** within a week ; making all those billions an even bigger waste ? 
  no i meant that 's why north korea exists in the first place . 
  during the korean war the americans had pushed the south korean border all the way north to the chinese border and then china went to war out if nervousness . 
  i read an article about a company of american troops defending a fortified hill from the chinese . 
  the americans would now down the approaching chinese troops , and when he americans thought the won , more chinese troops poured in .
