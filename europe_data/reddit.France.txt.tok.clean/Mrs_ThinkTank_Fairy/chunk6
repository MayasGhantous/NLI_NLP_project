  i was being a tad facetious . 
  yea , everybody should vote, 
  just so everyone 's clear : the vote of the slovak is more powerful than the vote of the french or german . 
  so , why did you waste your beefed up power vote ? 
  edit : this may be inappropriate , but i 'm genuinely angry at the people in small countries with low voter turnout . 
  this whole europe thing , needs just ** a little itty bitty bit ** of your attention and time ... 
  step one : ** find your political orientation !, 
  ** are you a communist ? 
  a fascist ? 
  a moderate conservative ? 
  a true centrist ? 
  a moderate centre-lefty ? 
  or are you a totalitarian/monarchist/theocrat ? 
  if you do n't know what those words mean * google it * step two : ** figure out who represents your political orientation !, 
  ** keep in mind that sometimes people vote for a party that has a really revolutionary idea or strategy that they like , but otherwise they disagree with the party 's political orientation . 
  step three : ** vote ** step four : watch your children and children 's children ** flourish in a strong , united , egalitarian europe . 
  i hate julian assange . 
  he tries to pretend like he cares about afghans privacy , he does n't give a shit he wanted to be back in the limelight that snowden and greenwald `` stole '' from him . 
  also he took advantage of and manipulated a psychologically vulnerable chelsea manning . 
  does n't their leader want to cut every mans penis off to promote egalitarianism ? 
   cracovians no way that 's what they 're called ?!, 
  super sexy name , i thought they were krakowska or something, 
  how offensive , everyone knows that the primary dutch speaking country is glorious aruba :p, 
  the correct format is english - jamaica flag portuguese - angola flag spanish - guatemala flag french - cameroon flag german - liechtenstein flag italian - san marino flag, 
  unless you vote for who i tell you to vote for  ... otherwise yea , i geuss . 
  the problem is those people are * always * the most vocal and passionate and vote for communists and fascists and theocrats and such, 
   scotsch, 
  or theocracy, 
  no , it means you are a genocidal totalitarian terrorist . 
  examples : hitler and stalin [ political circle ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvzj6wf.jpg ), 
  if you are an intelligence , well-read , rational and empathic person , you have a duty to vote . 
  for a person of this type , not voting is a grave disservice to both their country and europe . 
  are ... are you guys having a ` post-war germany ' moment but with political dysfunction and populism instead of jew-killing and poland-invading ?? 
  has italy been so scarred by berlusconi and so terrified by grillo that the trauma has left an permanent mark on their national psyche : never again will the italian people vote a shit-head into office ?? 
  i hope so . 
  edit : gerrunds, 
  i do n't live there , and it 's not that bad ... 
  but paris has a culture of discourteousness . 
  which is not a terrible thing for most people , i just prefer living in a smallish village where people are friendlier and you have more privacy . 
  edit : you see , i make a valid criticism of paris and i get downvotes . 
  that 's the shenanigans i 'm talking about - they are n't evil sociopaths ... 
  but they are generally dicks . 
  normal people who are dicks . 
  ( of course once of get to know them , you are like family and they are very warm , so i give them that . ), 
  ... ... that 's still better treatment than i get in paris . 
  it means that a single latvian mep could be very important and influential - especially if he 's charismatic , clever and motivated . 
  therefore you 're vote was not wasted because it contributed to someone that 's going to brussels , representing you and people like you more accurately . 
  also you have a duty to vote . 
  it is an obligation we all have to 1 ) our country and 2 ) europe, 
   `` a single grain of rice can tip the scale '' i was actually serious when i commented that initially, 
  not * everyone * in france acts like a sassy as fuck parisien i 've been to qu\u00e9bec many , many times . 
  specifically a resort on lac saint-stanislas , were you can rent snowmobiles , which i fucking love by the way . 
  this was a family affair in my childhood . 
  * been to la mauricie * mont-tremblant too * and obviously montr\u00e9al * i love cirque du soleil aaand bonus : i 've been down to louisiana , specifically to cajun country solely because i wanted to experience their culture , which i found to be extremely charming ... 
  holy snap , guy . 
  i was just being playful ... 
  hopefully not . 
  maybe we need to make it a reality ... 
  i mean there are definitely regions that share an identity - nordics , baltics , west slavs , balkans , greece & cyprus , the latins , the germanic continentals ( netherlands , germans , austrians , flanders , luxembourg ) and honestly , i think all western europeans have a lot in common historically , and i mean recent history . 
  i mean i personally feel `` western '' so members of `` the west '' sort of have a common identity that is indeed rooted in culture and politics and values . 
  iirc one of the expectations was that the eastern europeans would adopt western values ( because , let 's be honest , they 're the most advanced set of values mankind has ever known ), 
   eurosceptic party won 4 % . 
  that 's good to hear , i was worried about romania ( and bulgaria ) . 
  i thought they be a bit anti-eu because they have been `` verbally abused '' in the past 12 months, 
   there is no european identity there is no european identity blahblahblah blah i 'm so sick of people saying there 's no european identity . 
  people need to get over the ethnic shit and recognize that we need to stay together , improve the union and move forward, 
  or the effects of heavy immigration from both the former global empires and the migrants from eastern europe have combined to freak the shit out of the working classes ( even though the problem is n't as big as they think , it 's easy to influence them that it is because working classes are more likely to have these people as coworkers or neighbors ) but honestly , i 've been trying to think about what connects france and england . 
  i mean there is a long history , but the culture and politics are still quite different . 
  i really suspect it might be some sort of subconscious imperial pride left over from when we ruled the planet ... maybe subconsciously the english and the french believe they can regain their former glory , but it 's the eu that 's holding us back ... something like `` we ruled the fucking world , and then those bloody europeans ( ! ), 
  came in and fucked everything up , they are so incompetent !, 
  most of them never even had a single colony ! '', 
  i 'm pulling this all out of my ass , but i 'm sure freud would have agreed with me, 
  fyi the us just banned antibiotics for their meat and there is a strong movement to reform the meat industry . 
  also , i stopped reading at gmos , because gmophobia is bs, 
  i did n't mean to offend , but weird things can happen . 
  for example , nobody foresaw the collapse of communism in 1988 ... 
  but it did explode all of a sudden no one foresaw 9/11 , but it happened and america went insane with paranoia and changed the world forever no one foresaw the 2008 financial armageddon , but it happened and all of sudden greece was just an inch away from elected an actual , hardcore neo-nazi party into power . 
  no one foresaw euromaidan and certainly no one foresaw russia invading and annexing sovereign ukrainian territory . 
  * crazy shit happens , especially in europe , and we need something powerful to bind us together and neutralize each others madness . 
  oh , i thought it was farage . 
  lulz , that is too optimistic an outlook . . 
  here 's a secret : the eu works * because it economically intertwines our fates * ( yes yes it 's a double edged sword ... 
  but one edge is a lot sharper than the other ), 
  espagne , portugal and italie chose moderation !, 
  the latins still have some sense !, 
  some good news , * almost * makes up for france 's fuck-up ( keyword : almost ) ... . edit : does anyone know how our psychologically disturbed ( near russia syndrome ) little brother , roumanie , has done ? 
  i understand that , for a very long time france concentrated her entire european fleet in the mediterranean with the assumption that britain would protect her atlantic coast . 
  but like i said , conflict can and do snowball . 
  i mean , what about poland ? 
  poland could get taken by the far right and then take slovakia , czech , hungary , romania ... nato ( mainly the usa ) would probably not intervene , because the americans love the polish , and prefer them to all other eastern european states . 
  but then russia would intervene ... and then russia would become a superpower again and * then * the americans would intervene ... and would pressure the british to intervene ... and then so and so forth , the conflict inevitably snowballs into a fucking hell for everyone . 
  i 'm of the opinion that we have no choice but to remain united , fuck could you imagine a far right party rising in some place like hungary going to war with slovakia to `` liberate '' the land it lost in the treaty of trianon ? 
  because shit like that * would * happen . 
  edit : and then that conflict would `` snowball '' ... like it * always * does . . 
  umm they are if you 're french they need help to keep the anglo-saxon hordes at bay , 
   all these votes went to centre and left wing wow , the protest votes were * centrist * and * progressive * !? 
  did you tell them they 're not casting votes for latvia , they 're casting votes for europe ? 
  as the emperor of china said in disney 's * mulan *  `` a single grain of rice can tip the scale '', 
  ah , that 's good to hear . 
  i mean , it 's better than getting bat shit crazies elected into power,
