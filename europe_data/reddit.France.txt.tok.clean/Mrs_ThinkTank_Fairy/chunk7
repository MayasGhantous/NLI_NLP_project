  can we get a quick run down of what this means ? 
   seeks to make our flesh creep with his vision of ` political extremes and populism tearing apart the social fabric my god , he really is the shakespeare of inflammatory rhetoric clegg should * never * have debated him, 
  aye , the horn of progressivism shall sound in the deep , one last time . 
  ... let this be the hour when we conciliate together . 
  ... fell deeds awake . 
  now for accord . 
  now for integration . 
  and the red dawn !, 
  ...  [ [ * gimli blows into the horn of progressivism .

  one little financial crisis and we all got scared ... and the far-right said `` were breaking up the union cuz fuck the eu '', 
  aaaand he 's a child ... 
  so that pretty much explains it, 
  brb moving to qu\u00e9bec, 
   the russian leader was accompanied by a group of models on his arrival at the spa . 
  damn , he really is the russian berlusconi, 
   poland finished a highway bridge , the last obstacle between highways [ d1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d1_motorway_ ( czech_republic \\ ) ) ( czech republic ) and [ a1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a1_autostrada_ ( poland \\ ) ) ( poland ) . 
  these highways connects two industrial regions . 
  i 'm so happy to hear this !, 
  i love when cooperation / ways to cooperate increase between eu states, 
   chevron  gazprom but actually though ... 
  he 's right, 
  i was in quebec and the car i was in ran over a skunk ... 
  apparently when skunks are splattered a everywhere their smelly juices splatter everywhere too . 
  the whole car stank for a while , but fortunately it was not as enduring as a defensive spray from a live skunk . 
  you do n't understand the situation ... 
  the majority of people in eastern and southern ukraine will be voting for poroshenko, 
  yea , i agree . 
  great find . 
  it 's unbelievable . 
  truly jaw-dropping, 
  and this is all thanks to the english being tricksy ? 
  he died via suicide by police . 
  can expand upon svt a little ? 
  aye , indeed it is . 
  this was not muslims , people . 
  it was far-right wingers . 
  not be racist but he was driving an audi , it was a lone gunmen ( muslims attack in cells ) , there was no jihad-suicide attempt ... 
  brussels is a very international city, 
  because half of our meps are crazy as fuck edit : why downvotes ?? 
  it 's true . 
  i 'm hyperbolizing a bit but really half our meps are too emotional and ideologically stalwart . 
  the same goes for us congress , half of their congress is crazy as fuck too . 
  let 's have one crazy debate about it once it 's finalized . 
  if we let meps and congress people in on the negotiations ** there would be a huge ideological showdown over every little minute detail **, 
  well i think every country but russia is trying to talk it out but germany 's not warmongering , these people are convinced that anything a western country does is evil and imperialist, 
  man , he is fucking great . 
  also , he did n't lose his mind ; he just became angry and frustrated . 
  not the same . 
  just look at the widespread criticism farage got when he said he liked putin . 
  but we would n't be able to rule the world with out each other . 
  i actually believe that ... one thing i know about obama is that he values his legacy above all else . 
  i would n't be surprised if he pardons him on his last day in office ( depending on how things turn out ), 
  he 's ... 
  absolutely correct , the us should have let him get to ecuador . 
  i imagine ecuador is easier to pressure than russia, 
  i still like john kerry, 
  * news flash : in a stunning display of economic finesse , italy 's gdp has surged past china and the united states . 
  making it the world largest economy after a gdp growth rate of 56732 % in the 2nd quarter of 2014 . 
  you 're native to finland . 
  you are not a north american aboriginal . 
  really ? 
  norwegians are native to canada ? 
  i always thought they were scandinavians not inuit ... 
  okay , but your country will just be a moon orbiting the european planet . 
  just as canada is a moon orbiting the american planet . 
  the natives could head to the supermarket if they really wanted food and only food . 
  they go on hunts like that to practice their age-old traditions and to pass the culture of their ancestors on to the next generation . 
  i 'm saying that maybe you guys can only get a half assed solution , muslim turks and christian greeks uniting as one ? 
  it 's doable , but it will be a muddy solution that neither side will be satisfied with . 
  if you want perfection , you 'll need to make mutually agreed upon adjustments to ease the divide after unification . 
  oh no that would be terrible , you should definitely wait and take another 20 or so years to make sure the solution is perfect ... ... ... ... 
  also , prostitutes and strippers make even more money than the oil workers ( the men are lonely , and their pockets full of cash ), 
  i only think native peoples should be allowed to do this , using traditional techniques . 
  for natives , it would be the equivalent of bull fighting in spain ( or something ) edit : i was talking about canadian natives . 
  otherwise a mechanized baby seal clubbing industry will appear and use sonar , gps , helicopters to decimate the seal population . 
  next there going to say japan ca n't export baby dolphin meat !, 
  thanks be to god, 
   europe sells a bit of its soul to russia . 
  have you seen what they 've done to siberia ? 
  absolutely no environmental regulation or oversight . 
  if the same things happened in canada , norway , the north sea or alaska there would be a * furious * uproar . 
  the siberian wilds are dying . 
  in the mean time they can slowly manipulate us , in subtle ways . 
  because a lot of people vociferously hate science . 
  well you have fun being europe 's canada . 
  yes , germany in this day and age is not so vulnerable to this . 
  you will notice that italy is less vulnerable too : rome , naples , torino , milano , venice , sicily is it 's own thing . 
  if rome fell , torino could still do it 's thing . 
  i think . 
  my hypothesis here had to do with the relatively recent unifications of italy and germany . 
  these countries are frankensteins of many ` unipolar ' countries stitched together . 
  thus are multipolar . 
  here is my hypothesis as to why populist parties are gaining support : many european countries are ` unipolar ' meaning there is a large megacity that dominates the entire country - economically , politically and culturally . 
  these cities have ** tremendous gravity ** and when something happens in the prime city the entire country ( or region ) gets sucked into the situation . 
  paris , london , madrid , stockholm , lisbon , prague , athens , etc it also applies to large , geographic regions as well : catalonia gravitates around barcelona , southern italy gravitates around rome , piedmont gravitates around torino , lombardy around milano what does this mean ? 
  it means the people are concentrated , the power is concentrated , * the anger is concentrated * . 
  so what happens when things explode ? 
  ** riots , riots , riots ** and powerful riots that can topple a government . 
  ( ** look at kyiv !!,
