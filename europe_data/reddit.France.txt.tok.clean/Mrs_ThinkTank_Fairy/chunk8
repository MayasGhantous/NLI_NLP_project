  ** ) most european countries ** have a long history with revolutions / devastating riots ** where the common man , or the fascist , or the communist , or the starving peasant assemble and riot in such large numbers that they overwhelm the prime city . 
  our leaders know this , the political and scholarly ` castes ' know this . 
  they fear this , everyone but the rioters themselves fear this . 
  but the politicians fear it the most , because it will be their bodies who the rioters tear apart . 
  so of course , what does the establishment do ? 
  it 's not the government in paris ' fault , its the roma , the jews , the americans , the muslims , the africans , whatever . 
  the financial crisis brought europe to its knee 's , to shunt away the blame , to prevent a revolutionary riot they said : * the euro bound our financial fates together , when one eurozone nation falls the whole eurozone gets sucked down ( this one is actually true ) * austerity was blamed on supranational forces : the imf and the eu !, 
  they told us that our fiscal collapse was not because of years of terrible fiscal policy ** they said : it was brussels ** * unemployment went sky high , why ? 
  was it too a result of poor fiscal policy and corrupt / inept governance ? 
  they told us ** no , it is the bulgarians , the romanians , the slavs - they took our jobs from us ** * who is to blame for the hordes of eastern european job-stealers ? 
  ** they say : the eu no visa freedom of movement !, 
  ** this spirals out of control and the rhetoric takes on a life of its own . 
  far-right latched on to it , russian plutocrats who want a weak europe to prey on bolster it . 
  then we arrive at today . 
  this effect does not happen in the usa , it is cultural ( americans do not riot , except for race riots ) and the country is massive and has many centers of gravity ... like a nightcrawler with many hearts . 
  a revolution in los angeles will not destabilize nashville . 
  roughly this is how it goes . 
  just a hypothesis . 
  edit : theory changed to hypothesis, 
  i am personally very excited for the territorial reform . 
  i wonder what the effects will be on french society and governance . 
  i assume it will be positive , as the current centralized control of our territory is no longer necessary in the modern age . 
  yes they will accomplish something against those russian fucks . 
  and i do n't give a shit about whether or not this will provide fuel for anti-western propaganda . 
  if it did n't happen , they would just make it up anyway . 
  they are always full of shit , really . 
  you disagree ? 
  do you know how the geopolitics work ? 
  do you not see the photos of russian little green men with their rpgs , ak-47 's and anti-aircraft missiles ? 
  no matter how many downvotes you get , you 're still right . 
  not only factually correct , but ethically correct as well . 
  russia is playing a zero-sum realpolitik game in eastern ukraine . 
  we need to push back with the same techniques they are using , this is vital to helping ukraine . 
  i 'm ashamed that there are n't any european mercenaries fighting in eastern ukraine . 
  the americans deserve praise for this , they are helping a defenseless country . 
  this is good , right ? 
  or is this a controversy ? 
  i personally like that they caught a hacker , thats dangerous stuff in todays society . 
  what ? 
  are you retarded ? 
  do you know how important the european union is for france ? 
  do you remember what europe was like back before we were all united ? 
  if you are against the eu you are against france . 
  yes , it 's okay if it 's anti english , anti french or anti american but its nasty propaganda if it 's anti german or anti russian . 
  i hope the nsa is still spying on all of you . 
  and especially on your leaders . 
  it seems you * still * ca n't be fully trusted . 
  oh yea if it 's anti german , it 's vile shit but if it 's anti american it 's fucking golden, 
  this the bbc magazine , so it 's going to reflect the authors view more than usual bbc material . 
  a reborn soviet union would be a geostrategically mortal threat to our republic . 
  any citizen who supports those who seek to restore the russian empire is an enemy of the european union and thus a traitor to france . 
  i think there 's already enough proof for any rational person . 
  germany 's far right and far left have united on this issue , creating a shitstorm of putinists, 
  yes , of course a wild canadian appears out of nowhere as soon as you mention hockey, 
  if putin is sauron and russians are orcs , then front national is isenguard and le pen is saruman . 
  traitorous bitch . 
  douchebags . 
  i think pulling georgia out of russia 's orbit is not the purpose , it 's just a side effect . 
  and why ? 
  because georgians are a european people and therefore if they want to associate with the european union , then it should be so . 
  i can see why the russians want to invade , it 's so verdant, 
  this witch needs to burn at the stake . 
  no she was n't . 
  wut ... well , i think its safe to say that the nsa/gchq/dgse are completely vindicated for spying on russia 's little friend . 
  well , it 's not shilling because i think the covert agents are trying to gather intel, 
  yea that 's legit . 
  opposing armed forces is totally reckless . 
  yea i do n't think that guides for shills i think that 's for covert nsa agents that are trying infiltrate an online group . 
  they saw this and then up voted it, 
  well fuck that guy for helping russia . 
  and he 's not an civilian , he 's govt, 
  when i said `` as a society , they clearly have potential '' i meant they have potential to continue creating interesting works of literature and art . 
  however , it will be hard for them to create new and edgy forms of art if the government is too restrictive or if the intelligentsia feels the need to flee . 
  i thought they thought they were already in power . 
  this is also important because the young people are the ones who are going to be doing the fighting, 
  banderivtsy is at 60.5 % ? 
  * sigh * not a single documented case of banderivtsy attacking civilian russian-speakers or ethnic russians . . not a single documented case edit : overall , these poll results are encouraging . 
  just read and respond with whatever you think is a good response . 
  well , did n't they kill all of their authors and intellectuals for being subversive ? 
  so yea , i like free-russian works of art and literature , but the state sanctioned propaganda stuff is noxious . 
  and honestly , have you heard about the ` eurasianism ' ideology thats all the rage in russia right now ? 
  its totally absurd . 
  as a society , they clearly have potential , but i think it is stunted by their overbearing government . 
  china has a similar situation , in that their arts , literature and cinema are constrained by government censors . 
  this is why the best chinese movies come out of liberal hong kong and not mainland china . 
  i bet russia has a higher approval rating in germany than the us does . 
  can anyone confirm ? 
  i know full well about crimean history , and that does nothing to justify russians invasion and annexation . 
   you make it sound like crimea was never a part of russia and did n't have the majority of people being ethnical russians . 
  you have a sick mind . 
  just be happy that the americans , the british and the french are here to provide for your country 's security . 
  austria is nice and comfy surrounded by a sea of civlised nato members . 
  from each other , from russian imperialism and from a whole host of other potential rivals . 
  so russia just nabbed crimea , population 2.2 mln . 
  estonia has a population of 1.2 mln . 
  if estonia were n't a part of nato , russia would have little trouble gobbling it up . 
  same with lithuania and latvia . 
  then poland , a up and coming economic engine of the eu , is sharing a big long border with the new russian empire . 
  you have forgotten what just happened a few weeks ago , clearly the shock has worn off . 
  * russia invaded a sovereign country and annexed a part of its territory .
