  this is the first time this has happened in europe since the 1940 's . 
  russia will invade and annex whenever it gets the chance . 
   so i want to make a case that a bigger military of the eu would not have helped , it would have helped , the only reason the us said that crimea was lost to the russians was because the us would have taken * months * to get enough force positioned near crimea to retake it ( which would give russia a lot of time to fortify crimea ) . 
  if the eu had a military , then it would be positioned to retake crimea in a blitz . 
  if russia knew the eu had this capability to retake crimea so quickly , they would not have taken the gamble to take crimea . 
  this user is from a country that does not really have a role in keeping the world safe and free , so his or her worldview may not think about the importance of military spending by great powers . 
  they * mistakenly * only see the militaries of great powers as forces of imperialism and destruction . 
   nato circle jerk oh how , surprising the defense umbrella that protects europe is popular in / r/europe, 
   because the americans are the one pushing for more military spending no they are n't , everyone but germany is pushing for more military spending . 
  and the americans are only pushing for this because they want to lower their defense spending, 
  umm a decade of us occupation would do * wonders * in ukraine . 
  ukrainians are not like iraqis or afghans , if the us pumped $ 200 bln into ukraine every year for 12 years , ukraine would be a fucking first world country for sure . 
   i do n't know why you 're down voted everyone has magically forgotten the bullshit circus of crimea already, 
  mccain 's right , germany has been too soft on russia . 
  and what 's that last sentence supposed to mean , is this really all about money for the germans ? 
  are you absolutely mad ? 
  did you really completely forget about what russia is doing on nato borders ? 
  i 'm sorry my friend , but i 'm going to ask you to return to reality , the post-cold war order has been interrupted , the post `` geopolitics '' dream is over . 
  strong military deterrent is vital to contain a land-hungry russia . 
   connections circumventing data eating machine of the us nah , probably will still be going through the data eating machine of the us or it 's allies - dgse or gchq, 
  yea , it 's totally political gain . 
  after may 25ish , none of this will be as visible and no one will be as angry . 
  remember earlier how big of a deal this was before the german elections , and then it passed into ` whatever ', 
  yes they do , you have no idea how much support they provide to the french armed forces and to the french intelligence community . 
  oh , you are a dumb one indeed . 
  you want russians and saudis to have as much power and influence as americans ? 
  meaningless is a bit extreme , he does have certain powers and influences as the leader of a nato member, 
  why did you bring up the usa ? 
  i do n't like that a far rightwing regime is reintroducing the gendarmerie to hungary . 
  feels like this came out of no where edit : * le tourisme politique *, 
   we can not leave europe to populists and nationalists this is more important than most of us seem to realize . 
   europe in the world - only together can we be strong i hope this means developing a more strategic foreign policy, 
  i actually do n't know , some would think its sinful , most would think its unhealthy but not a terrible mark of shame and others would think its a beautiful expression of sexuality or something . 
  if it was a really old lady whose had these partners consistently throughout her whole life ; like she had a new lover each summer and winter ; that would be seen as exciting and intriguing . 
  is that khodorkovsky in that pic with her ? 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  i meant front national , jobbik-types and bnp types not eurosceptics . 
  ahhhh !, 
  my app keeps playing the music even after i closed the page !, 
  but good work on that battle , only 667 swedish casualties well done indeed, 
  umm the worst is clearly behind us . 
  yea we got shit to work out , that 's why we are n't 4 % gdp growth usa but damn we 'll get there and we 'll get there together . 
  it 's also says the worst is behind us and thanks be to god for that, 
  [ american business news site says `` the eurozone recovery is in full flow '' ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/101554114 ), 
  good they 're integrated but 2 % to 60 % is a fucking huge increase , so congrats, 
  i wish more sites would do that . 
  in fact , i wish there were n't any comment sections at all !, 
  because i can never resist reading them , and they ** always ** piss me off . 
  even if i agree with them , they are so stupidly said that they piss me off . 
  yea but theres all the far right wing shitheads who are on the scene right now and the eurozone recover has n't picked up to full steam yet . 
  i do think the eurozone will regain its full strength , because apparently the us is going to have 4 % growth in 2014 according ( so itll at least have 3.5 % , which is a lot for a big economy ) and if the us economy is picking back up then we will follow too , just we will be a bit delayed . 
  but thats what spooks me , we 've still got a bit to go and the far right is just going nuts . 
  okay , this is kind of freaking me out ... 
  i just read something about the eu is falling out of fashion with german intellectuals too makes me nervous that my stable continental germanics are seriously doubting the eu, 
  i briefly imagined what it would be like if we resurrected the holy roman empire and expanded it across europe . 
  i concluded that in this hypothetical situation , we would end up killing each other and everyone else on earth via nuclear holocaust, 
  . . putin ? 
  if you live in latvia , you should learn latvian . 
  it 's better for everyone that way . 
  no italy does not have such a severe problem with nationalists in such a way, 
  thus , * l'esprit d'hussard *, 
  the hussar spirit lives on . 
  okay whatever blah blah blah rossiya blah blah ... 
  well , i 'm ashamed . 
  let 's just fight a war and be over with it ... 
  obviously , yes . 
   eastern europe seems to be falling for it hardly surprising given their history, 
  it probably has a lot to do with the fact that putin assured obama that he would pull back his troops last friday and then he only pulled back ~ 500 or so . 
  that 's seems to be freaking out all the nato/baltic/ukrainian / polish people . 
  obviously igniting nationalism . 
  i assumed you were another far right wing nationalist because you were being antiamerican which i interpreted as somehow being anti eu and pro-russia ... 
  anyway , i see from your history that you 've posted to socialism and that you 're progressive . 
  i just made all that shit up on the top of my head . 
  there are ** so ** many ultranationalist around these days that i immediately go into troll mode whenever here certain buzzwords . 
  i do n't believe any of that shit . 
  ( actually , i 've been trolling this hardcore far right russian guy by telling him that russian orthodoxy is more similar to shia islam than to christianity ... he has responded * very * aggressively and it 's wonderful ) tl ; dr thought you were ultranationalist and made shit up to troll you , sorry !, 
  the ukrainians are are lion-hearted like the poles and intellectual like the czech and slovaks . 
  also , they follow the kyiv patriarchate of orthodoxy , which is more in line with christ 's teachings than russian orthodoxy . 
  i like this weimar triangle . 
  it is the perfect combo : nukes , economy and hussar, 
  russian funded right wing parties . 
  look it up , they believe that shit . 
  well , hopefully ukraine will make up for the failure of romania , bulgaria and hungary . 
  cultural indicators suggest that ukraine will go the path of slovakia , czech and poland . 
  thank god for this . 
  this is more snowden shit trying to divide the west in a time of crisis for russia . 
  frankly , i think it 's time for germans to let this issue go . 
   they do n't want us to believe that socialism is a legitimate alternative . 
  okay , have you forgotten that in order to have a successful socialist state , you must first establish a developed , capitalist state ? 
  marx told us this , you must reach a certain level of development before you become socialist ; otherwise true socialism can not take root . 
  venezuela before chavez was far from industrialized . 
  in this climate , socialist projects are wise ; but full fledged , true socialism is not . 
   high middle class students it 's not just upper-middle class students , it 's the opposition in general . 
  the students are often on the front lines doing the most aggressive things because they 're young and bold and idealistic . 
  but the movement is broader than that , and it 's not just the wealthy . 
  it 's upper-middle class , middle class , working class and urban poor . 
  chavez and now maduro have run out of innovative policies to help propel venezuela forward ; they did good things to bring modernity to rural indians , but their policies have becoming increasingly painful for the urban middle/working classes . 
  these people represent a huge portion of the population and they currently are struggling to purchase even the most basic goods , [ like toilet paper . 
  ] ( http://m.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24185342 ) chavez and maduro have relied on hydrocarbon revenue to fund their social projects ; and now that hydrocarbon prices are beginning to fall , they can no longer afford to maintain the status quo . 
  furthermore , the protestors are the nations educated intelligentsia , artists and journalists .
