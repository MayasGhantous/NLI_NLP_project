ah yes !, 
  `` the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy '' says it all :-)  ... since it is now well established that all known gods came into existence a good three-millionths of a second after the universe began rather than , as they usually claimed , the previous week , ... 
  i had so much fun reading this gem :-), 
  of course . 
  how to talk about future relationships before clarifying disengagement consequences ? 
  that would be non-sense . 
  yeah , netherlands knows how to build big walls .

  salvador dali , famous european citizen , said [ center of universe is perpignan 's trainstation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_gare_de_perpignan ) .

  no , there is a ` neighbours dispute ' between france and belgium that both claim they invented [ french fries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_fries ) . 
  i totally agree this was a rhetorical question . 
  what i meant is that we need to be ready to see a lot of posts telling the exact opposite of this one in a few weeks . 
  dae think there should be a verb after dae ? 
  sophisticated metal music , i like that !,

  a band from aix en provence ( south east of france ) playing f ` ing good pop-rock , rap , dub . . in english please  all that free on youtube , top quality videos . 
  their flag is a mustache , only lilly boy , the female singer , does not wear it . 
  their slogan is ` soyez moustachu ' for the lolz . 
  just in case you do n't already know them : easiest way to start : french touch with 'm ' , a great french music composer : [ baby that 's you ] ( https://youtu.be/-p3tphjteas ) about broken hearth , you know ... and then , you may enjoy another fr couple ( de luxe and i am ) , eu rap : [ a l'heure o\u00f9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiifjra77em ) about time when lower classes can not stand it anymore .

  i am listening right now to this interview ( made in 2014 btw ) . 
  interesting talk about scottish nationalism . 
  john paul lepers is a famous - and controversial - interviewer in france . 
  i like him , he made great reportages about french society , demounting ` id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues ' . 
  i can not distinguish any scottish accent when alyn smith spoke french tbh . 
  they switched to en langage for ` international ' i guess . 
  once again , it is good to have a common langage . 
  [ simplified english ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/english-traditional-simplified.jpg ) is the one , no problem , 
  ok , no worries . 
  classic misunderstanding between non native langages !, 
  between you and me  i do n't know what is `` snp mep '' ? 
  i fully agree . 
  despite uk never played eu political game ; it is/was a big power , in every meaning , inside eu . 
   most of the east - from my experience - see the e.u. 
  as a political tool , rather than an ideal . 
  do eastern eu countries need more time to embrace eu political project ? 
  will it not be too late ? 
  putin is biting crimea , east of ukraine , what is next ? 
  all that with usa moving away from nato , setting fires in middle-east and north korea . 
  eu is too weak to handle this chite , especially with uk retiring . 
  happy days ahead :-(, 
  i am not sure to understand your comment . 
  i am french , talking to an italian person living in uk , and saying he/she will move elsewhere . 
  and i am right now drinking a `` leffe '' beer from belgium . 
  europe so to say . 
  english is - and will stay - our common eu langage . 
   my pension situation is going to look like a real european nightmare this ( and ireland situation ) is what concerns me most about brexit . 
  political and economical matters will recover by themselves faster than citizens who trusted eu life ( once again , no offence to uk ) . 
  ok , sorry to be this sjw , 
  hold my wine , 
  you are right : 1st ) identify yourself as a member of a nation instead of a  duchies , free cities , princedoms , republics , bishoprics and what not . 
  to stop local wars among these micro-states . 
  2nd ) identify yourself as a member of a continent ( europe )  against nationalism and for a more supranational approach to things to share human values and join political / economical forces against other continents 3rd ) identify yourself as a member of planet earth to < insert your global values here , 
  even if it was true , who cares ? 
  first time i hear/see music in colors !, 
  incredible , just like inside my brain  and the quotes from time to time in this video are priceless !, 
  peaceful and mindful ...

  pretty in the sjw trend , 
  beautiful photo , sky and city . 
  now , i want to build budapest in cities skylines , 
  um ... you need more than a dick for this contest , 
  hahaha , what 's the f ? 
  yum-yum . 
  i was not . 
  like not at all . 
  a turbulent member is better than one less member . 
  uk place in eu is/was huge . 
  we are dealing with a lose-lose deal now . 
  ha ok , i did not realize you were living in uk right now ( looking at your flag ) .
