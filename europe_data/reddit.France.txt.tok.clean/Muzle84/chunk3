   during the 80s i made a trip to usa with my back-pack and a ` greyhound bus pass ' in my pocket . 
  in boston , or maybe new heaven , i met an american girl on a ferry-boat . 
  when i said i was french , she started to sing the song . 
  i was stunned , she told me this was a song to learn french at school . 
  i spent a platonic night with her , 
  yeah , eu is a jewish conspiracy . 
   strategic laziness oh yes , my comment was not negative . 
  uh ... we , french , believe we are smart enough to be a bit lazy , 
  right . 
  all in all , europeans like eu more , not ** thanks to ** eu getting better , but ** because of ** worrying external factors . 
  what did you learn about people thanks to this trip ? 
  anything you would * not * have discovered without making it ? 
  yes , i was really impressed by [ this interview ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gz22u/the_congratulations_stop_when_we_find_that_you/ ) . 
  great lady !, 
  [ pont saint benezet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pont_saint-b%c3%a9n%c3%a9zet ) , also known as the pont d'avignon , was built between 1177 and 1185 . 
  repeatedly broken by floods , it fell into a state of disrepair during the 17th century . 
  there is a song that dates back to the 15th century about it : [ `` sur le pont d'avignon , on y dance '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujkfxtyat0s ), 
  meanwhile , in paris : [ vivatech ] ( https://vivatechnology.com/ ) is a hub for the world 's innovators and tech-lovers .

  last day tomorrow , opened to public . 
   as little as possible , especially when the weather is nice . 
  dude , you are really french now , 
  i think brexit is not the only reason . 
  ` trump factor ' is a real thing imho . 
  populism and far-right rise also . 
   putin is actively trying to destabilize europe . 
  right , and so does trump , especially these `` bad '' germans . 
  usa is trying to weaken both russia and europe at the same time .

  i love cheddar , 
  keep up the good job trump !, 
  not fair . 
  and not realistic . 
  do n't forget cheese . 
  in france , we say : `` netherlands , the other country of cheese . '', 
  as i am also ( genuinely ) interested , i had a look at wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_cheese [ oka cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oka_cheese ) looks good !, 
   `` we have indications that the japanese government will make concessions on agricultural tariffs , particularly concerning pork meat and wine '' is one of the sub-titles of the article . 
  and :  safety net for farmers  one of japan 's biggest concerns about sealing a deal with europe has been fear of a backlash from its fragile farming sector , amid worries of an onslaught from mighty eu agricultural exporters . 
  tokyo 's parliament last week passed a package of reforms to boost japanese farmers , which could help sweeten the bitter pill of an eu trade deal by addressing sectors such as dairy . 
   some eu diplomats argue those reforms would strengthen the hand of japan 's government in pushing for a deal , while others point out that much of tokyo 's defensive stance on agriculture was posturing . 
  throughout years of negotiation , tokyo played hardball over products such as tomatoes , pasta and cheese , in which it has no real defensive stake . 
  japan 's own priority has been to break down the eu 's 10 percent tariff on cars . 
   silva pereira said approval of the farm reforms was `` a good sign '' because it would give the asian country more leeway in opening its agricultural market . 
  nah , that 's when she heard [ french national guard playing ` dont ' look back in anger ' ] ( http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/france-england-football-friendly-dont-look-back-in-anger-2017-6/ ) .

  thank you very much for your answer about article 50 . 
  very interesting , because [ text of ( 50 ) itself ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html ) does not mention anything about this possibility . 
  i * feel * you , and other european redditors itt , point something ` weird ' about uk leaders . 
  i still can not understand what exactly . 
  i do n't understand . 
  what 's the point in shooting oneself twice in own foot to get a better deal with eu ? 
  also , recall of article 50 is possible ??? 
  maybe i did not get at all what you meant ,
