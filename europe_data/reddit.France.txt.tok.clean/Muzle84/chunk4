  [ anarchy in the uk ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbmws6jf5dc ), 
  seen on r/worldnews :  june is , indeed , the end of may all credits to u/thekillerjester, 
  [ too much paranoid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq1kqzqhpzy ) , 
  dangerous law for a dangerous world . 
  not so high five , 
  very bad news for eu . 
  eu needs someone to talk to . 
  pretty sure that is the intention , but sh ... , 
  hey , france also have stuff to sell !, 
  good missiles , planes , boats . 
  very powerful , very porwerful . 
  you can choose color at no extra cost . 
  germoney accepted no problem , 
  exactly my 1st thought . 
  seriously ? 
  yes , you are right in this context . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  il marche sur l'eau ( he walks on the waters ) macron = jesus !, 
  i sincerely hope i will have a stable neighbour after these elections . 
  what do you want to do ? 
  ban all muslims to prevent the one among hundreds of thousands to go nuts ? 
  if so , why not ban everybody , native people included ? 
  tsss karma farming ... op did not post it only on r/europe . 
  i upvoted your original post . 
  fyi , internal reddit 's links should use np.reddit.com instead of www.reddit.com . 
  edit : except if link points to source post . 
  happy days ahead :( i am french and work since ten years for a company owned by a british group . 
  i am not concerned at all by my own professional future , i just want to say here that my own experience of brits is that they are very nice people , very respectful of others culture . 
  this escalator is made of op , 
  wtf ? 
  some comments itt are at covfefe level !, 
  ... as a result of american cultural imperialism / s, 
  british tabloids are at it again , 
  trump wanted to divide europe , he unites nearly whole world against him and divides his own country . 
  sad . 
  bloody difficult women do ... 
  and covfefe . 
  [ good press in germany this morning  ] ( https://static-eu-central-1.theguardiansofdemocracy.com/uploads/2017/06/newspaper.jpg ), 
   some people just can not stand when things in other countries do n't proceed in a way they wish to . 
  right across ? 
  like , where the projector is located ? 
  greenpeace : we forget about rainbow warrior , if we can place our projector here . 
  france : rainbow what ? 
  i think position is vacant right now . 
  i know now why she looks sad , 
  i agree . 
  it will be long , and painful for some . 
  i still think ` our wallets ' are core of a useful eurozone . 
  i am french , some of my friends say `` i do n't want to pay for others '' . 
  i answer them : `` do you realize they will be our best customers tomorrow ? '' . 
  eu and eurozone are big challenges . 
  we have to think long term , i believe it is worth it . 
  thanks . 
  i am tired , 
  can somebody eli5 this map ? 
  i am lost reading comments ( and title of map ) . 
  i may be tired ... let me take an example : france on the map , with spain written in it . 
  does it mean spanish people are the majority of immigrants living in france or most of french emigrants go live in spain ?? 
  haha  did you watch this [ america first italy second ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_8spmwvyye&amp;feature=youtu.be ) video ? 
  wait for it ... ( 3:08 ), 
  mutualisation is a good thing . 
  see eu and eurozone as your car insurance company . 
  some good drivers think it is unfair , but that 's the basis of risk mutualisation : probability stays the same , but stake is lowered for everyone . 
  open your eyes, 
  mods are worshiping [ thor ] ( http://www.nsm88.org/merchandise/jewelery/thors%20hammer.jpg ) , the god who protects web surfers from shit-storms . 
  so , i checked : `` it is a great honor to be here with all of my friends . 
  so amazing i will never forget ! '',

   poem for your sprog i had to ~ ~ google ~ ~ duckduckgo this one !, 
  no , not me , 
  repeat until it becomes true . 
  repeat until it becomes true . 
  repeat until it becomes true . 
  my very reliable , very reliable , source tells me germany starts to counter-attack with same rhetoric . 
  trump 's vocabulary = 140 characters ( max ) . 
   eh , it 's a question of enforcement . 
  germany ca n't go around enforcing the law against people outside germany . 
  you are assuming facebook has only one monolithic content world-wide . 
  an international business has to follow a foreign market laws if it adresses directly these foreign customers . 
  facebook let german people access its services , has a eula written in german , a german ui , german ads : it adresses directly german people . 
  facebook has to respect german law in such case . 
  source : ` it and legal responsibilities ' training i had 2 years ago . 
  eh u are right op please edit, 
  brexit and theresa may using trump 's rethoric are nothing to laugh about , especially in europe . 
  not a sarcasm , dead people never come back  seriously , some come back after having been trained there , to make terrorist attacks on europe soil . 
  very good idea . 
  thanks !, 
  right . 
  and dead people do n't come back . 
  hahaha excellent !, 
  how about * cultural influence * , and french-speaking pro ~ ~ paganda ~ ~ motion ?
