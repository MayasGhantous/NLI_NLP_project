  about french reputation being surrenders , as i see itt people mention it , be it as wrong or true : this bashing started in 2003 , when france said no to usa to help them invade iraq . 
  2nd best for beautiful and classy women after italy ( i am french ), 
  thank you very much . 
  merci beaucoup . 
  so , who is `` they '' in this article ? 
  uk , eu , other ? 
  i thought it was already everyone . 
  oth , some anthem 's lyrics can be ... outdated to say the least . 
   she told the bbc earlier this month that she will be a `` bloody difficult woman '' period . 
  ^ ^ sorry ... could n't ^ ^ resist, 
  riiiight ... also : feet *, 
   they do n't do self deprecating humour though . 
  at all . 
  do n't even know what it is coluche , a famous french humorist ( at least in france ) said : do you know why coq is french animal emblem ? 
  that is because it is the only bird that keeps on singing while feets in the mud . 
  aww . 
  who is pealing onions near me ? 
  when i click on the thumbnail , 4chan wants to verify i am not a bot ... 
  i think this is too much asking , 
  today is second round . 
  french president will be known in ~ 2hours . 
  you are right : 28 % at noon , 65.5 % at 5pm ( fr ) . 
  avignon, 
  absolutely right . 
  on the other hand , crusaders ... and to be clear , i am catholic . 
  so , i did my duty . 
  participation in my ` vote office ' at 4pm fr was 65.5 % . 
  that is rather good . 
  felix faure is my hero . 
  he had a heart attack in the arms of a prostitute . 
  do you mean for a kid , or not ? 
  if the latter , i would suggest : south park : really good voice acting in french . 
  kaamelott series are very funny . 
  if you ask for a kid , then i do n't know . 
  simplified english , as opposed to traditional english , why not ?

  while visiting brussels a few years ago , i noticed an interesting thing about poster ads ( in the streets , stations , etc. 
  ) : they had to be doubled : one in french , and the other in flamish or , if there was only one poster , it had to be in ... english . 
  in brussels . 
  omg !, 
  what langage will we use on this sub then ? 
  two years ... 
  i am already fed-up of this propangada , from both sides . 
  what about [ this one ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xw5xl_trust-antisocial_music ) ? 
  ah le petit vin blanc qu'on boit sous les tonnelles : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzbjr11mq6y&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
  i tell everybody . 
  i got an haircut yesterday , and shouted ` everybody go vote on sunday ! ', 
  when leaving the shop :-), 
  will do !, 
  china is china , the oldest civilization in the world . 
  it will never be a westernized country . 
  eu has to deal with it , especially now , when trump is trying to set the world on fire for the sake of his expensive - and largely underused - military . 
  you are not alone , i fully agree with you , especially with your part : `` if ideological issues are being put away '' . 
  eu needs more pragmatism for international matters . 
  yep . 
  tap . 
  tap tap ?!? 
  i think my universal translator is broken . 
  so , how is the weather in greece ? 
  i was pretty distracted for some reasons . 
  one year ago , i would have thought furthering eu-china relations is ... not necessary . 
  now i want pandas everywhere in europe . 
  how comes ? 
  1 ) yes , among others . 
  2 ) eu is trying to protect us from this neoliberal philosophy , at least as much as it can ( and i do n't understand why a secularised society is bad by definition ) . 
  once again : do you think things would be better for you without eu ? 
  like : would you vote for a ` polexit ' if you had the opportunity ? 
  thank you for your reply , you give concrete examples . 
  as i said , i do n't want to argue , but i can not help asking you : do you feel things would be better for you without eu ? 
  i ask because for me , one of the most noble objective of eu is to help countries to develop for a better life for its citizens . 
  are we failing on that point ? 
  why do you say you are treated like shit by europeans ? 
  sincere question , not trying to ` argue ' , i would like to better understand your point of view . 
  hahaha excellent !, 
  i am french , i did not know this sentence . 
  it 's so true !, 
  wonderful photo . 
  now i want to build konstanz with cities skylines . 
  is there a map in steam workshop ? 
  pm : ~ ~ eu ~ ~ may * trying to influence election with threats, 
  i can answer for my country , france : we love to complain about anything . 
  so called ` highly unusual emergency meeting ' is to announce prince philip is retiring . 
  yeah , too bad they decided to leave the euro zone ... oh wait . 
  ** let 's make yurop stronk again !, 
  interesting . 
  what is the meaning of this monument ? 
  i read http://curious-places.blogspot.fr/2015/05/the-invisible-church-borgloon-belgium.html but all it says is that official name is `` reading between the lines '' and how it is made , but not why . 
  idk . 
  maybe brits would also speak german without ussr + usa + uk + many-other-countries blood sacrifice . 
  `` second richest country '' ... `` inside eu '' i guess . 
  so , after a corrida , a tourist goes to a restaurant to try famous ` bull 's cojones ' meal . 
  he loved it so much that he goes back to same restaurant the day after and order same meal , knowing another corrida occured during the afternoon . 
  but this time , meal is much smaller than the day before . 
  he asks the waiter who tells him : `` well , sometimes the bull wins . '', 
  i have a slightly different interpretation , maybe because i 'm french . 
  `` hold my wine '' could be followed by '' ... and look at what i am going to do '' . 
  we have presidential elections at the end of this month . 
  far right and far left populist candidates are in an unusual good position according to polls . 
  will french people listen to ` populism songs ' like us for trump and uk for brexit ? 
  ( i think turkey is another story : not populism , but people manipulation . ),
