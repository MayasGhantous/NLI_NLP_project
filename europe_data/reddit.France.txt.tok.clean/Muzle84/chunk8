  there are a lot of festivals during summer in france . 
  i live in avignon , and we have two theatre festivals there in july : * [ festival in ] ( http://www.festival-avignon.com/en/ ) : classic theatre with well known actors on prestigious stages like [ ` le palais des papes ' ] ( http://www.festival-avignon.com/public_data/diapo/place/1462/1418053295/thumb/courdhonneur1_crdl.jpg ) . 
  * [ festival off ] ( http://www.avignonleoff.com/ ) : created in in 1966 , this festival is for new theatre companies and new spectacles . 
  it 's pretty huge : 1000 spectacles this year !, 
  festival off is very popular , whole city is [ covered with posters ] ( http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/sites/default/files/assets/images/2013/05/festivaloffavignon20121.jpg ) , they are really [ everywhere ] ( https://unpoissonnommemarcel.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_7517.jpg ) . 
  and there are [ a lot of animations in the streets ] ( https://www.francebleu.fr/s3/cruiser-production/2016/07/1a2866fb-def3-4d94-b837-22e9b16ee40e/870x489_20160706_173345.jpg ) , made by actors to [ promote their spectacle ] ( https://dubreuilgael.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/alice-avignon-off.jpg ) .

  america exported this culture to western societies at the end of wwii and during cold war . 
  consumerism , artificial creation of ` needs ' for the sake of business . 
  eu will miss british humour for sure , 
  edit : not exactly an organization , more like a political concept , introduced by my country to gatt in 1993 . 
  [ cultural exception ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_exception ) is a policy that considers culture is not a commercial product like the others . 
  states are sovereign to decide a mix of protectionism ( for example , quotas of foreign songs on radios ) and subventions policies . 
  no commercial treaties should go against cultural exception . 
  one country is strongly opposed to this concept , arguing that it harms global trade . 
  i let you guess which one ... 
  to my knowledge , euthanasia is still not allowed in france . 
  but we have ` heavy ' or ` deep ' ~ ~ palliative ~ ~ sedative care ( unsure of correct word in english ) , which is same thing . 
  my brother ` benefited ' of it two months ago . 
  rip bruno . 
  edit : sedative instead of palliative .

  flag of the kingdom of france from 1814 to 1830 ( bourbon restoration ) was white . 
  is this what you meant or am i feeding a troll ? 
  edit : looking at your reddit history , you do n't look like a troll , 
  thanks . 
  i guess there is a typo in previous comment then . 
  being surrenders . 
  this chite started in the early 2000 's , ` thanks to ' republican america , because france did not want to help usa invade iraq . 
  truth is nazis easily invaded france during ww2 . 
  that is because we built a huge military ** wall ** called ` ligne maginot '' to prevent germany from trying again after ww1 . 
  french military was so ** self-assured ** with this wall , that they may had a little nap while nazi army was like ` huhuhu hohoho , let 's go through belgium then ' . 
  owned !, 
  haha  we used to say that from scottish people a long time ago . 
  then , dutch tourists started to enjoy visiting france during summer . 
  now , ` nl ' sticker on a car stands for ` nuch lemonade ' for us , 
  daily . 
  i can skip sunday if i do n't go out . 
  i am french , and you are totally right . 
  my own langage fucks me sometimes  despite i believe i think i am quite educated and open minded . 
  ` ambient sexism ' is really a thing !, 
  thanks for correction . 
  a long time ago , aristocratic european students finished their studies by traveling to main capitals in europe , to better know their neighbors . 
  today , we have erasmus program for same benefit . 
  tomorrow , students will go to the moon to feel how it is important to preserve our home planet . 
  france is ... france french is fran\u00e7ais ( m ) or fran\u00e7aise ( f ) . 
  plural is fran\u00e7ais . 
  there are a lot of people from maghreb origin ( algeria , morocco , tunisia ) in france . 
  that is because these countries were part of ` french empire ' . 
  anyway , your observation is really exaggerated . 
  it all depends on which district you visited i guess . 
  according to our ` national institute of statistics ' ( insee ) , immigrants are ~ 9 % of french people , and ~ 30 % of them were born in maghreb . 
  so , people born in algeria , morocco or tunisia are ~ 3 % of french population . 
   because they felt more french than algerian . 
  these algerians are [ harkis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harki ) . 
  imho , the way they have been dealt with by france after algerian independence is shameful . 
  at that time , french government just had no plan for them . 
  repatriation of french colonialists ( [ pieds-noirs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pied-noir ) ) was only concern and already messy enough . 
  i do n't think they are the majority of algerian origin people in france though . 
  people from maghreb origin are ` standard immigrants for a job ' , with big waves during the late 60 's and in the 70 's . 
  and we talk a lot about the new cook recipe using the other cauldron . 
  and we feel smart because we are not animals , no guards required . 
  but we will still watch movies like [ a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=boy144n_tj0 ) , 
  because it would occur in decades , and at that time eu will have developed its social-political project , with no cherry-peaking for its members .
