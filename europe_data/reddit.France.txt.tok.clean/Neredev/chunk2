  while both positions can be argued , if we boil down to the facts , gogol was essentially russian . 
  you should watch this [ film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oo7h25kirk ) and read gogol 's short stories in * evenings on a farm near dikanka * and * petersburg 's short-stories * if you 're interested . 
  i had kebabs in germany and they were also in the lower tier fast-foods . 
  are you kidding ? 
  a kebab 's only ability is to fill my drunk stomach with fat . 
  it 's dog food compared to lebanese fast food or a french sandwich . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btdazmtdcu4 ) is also pretty good in a subtle way but i 'm too lazy too explain it . 
  mitterand was really an expert at humiliqtiong you in public with a smile . 
  it 's not like we see the colour of your money . 
  it all goes to poland and the likes . 
  damn , i wish i had seen this thread sooner . 
  i 'm probably the biggest russiaboo on this side of the dniepr so i 'll narrow it down : - the history is crazy interesting , because it is a western and eastern country at the same time . 
  also orthodoxy is pretty [ rad ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kso9cfi.jpg ) . 
  - music wise , russia produced many of the greatest composers in history like [ tchaikovski ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywqdohf6lhe ) , [ borodine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiqfb9prbmk ) or rachmaninoff . 
  - in literature and philosophy there are obviously the big ones like chekhov , tolstoi an akhmatova , but also some pretty good contemporaries like makine , limonov or volodine . 
  - the language in itself is one of the very few that i consider above the rest . 
  the sonorities are just so pretty and interesting , it 's full of `` ny\u00e9 '' `` chny '' `` ty\u00e9 '' and sounds like that . 
  - their contribution to science is also pretty important ( hello mendeleev ) although very uneven : while the ussr space program kicked ass , they really sucked biology-wise ( hello comrade lysenko ) . 
  also , as someone interested in weapons dem sukhoi and mig man !, 
  - the sheer immensity of the countries and the diveristy of landscapes and wilderness that one can witness . 
  - the mixture of total hilarity and deep despair that is present in russian culture is one of the things that i like the most and can relate with . 
  proud , miserable people strike me as familiar . 
  it 's from a different era but the zouave uniforms were fucking cool too . 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8d9s5wh.jpg ) during the crimean war . 
  the colonial armies often had interesting uniforms : here 's another pic of two [ zouaves ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uprmaqw.jpg ) in crimea . 
  the spahis were also pretty cool looking : http://i.imgur.com/y5mbom1.jpg http://i.imgur.com/daznsfq.jpg http://www.ecpad.fr/wp-content/gallery/album_14_juillet_2012/22_2012ecpa227l001_020.jpg, 
  this . 
  nothing will change , the answer to every problem will still be `` more eu !, 
  considering that gypsies do n't buy tickets , trash public services and places and steal from other passengers , i think that this town is kind enough to continue to provide them with service . 
  from brittany , lived in lyon for the past 2 years . 
  you really say gr\u00e8\u00e8\u00e8\u00e8ce ? 
  except it is completely theoretical . 
  in real life people pronunce it in the exact same way . 
  do we have philipino immigrants in france ? 
  i 've never met any . 
  vietnamese are god-tier immigrants though . 
  they assimilate , work , study and you never hear any whining about discrimination . 
  if only africans could be like them ... 
  when i was a kid greece made me laugh because in french it is pronunced exactly like * graisse * , which is french for fat . 
  i imagined a country with only fat people . 
  also , in french we also use `` hell\u00e8ne '' as in * la r\u00e9publique hell\u00e8ne * . 
  it was especially surprising because we wiped the floor with them earlier in the century . 
  the impact in europe was huge . 
   i do have to ask : why would you want to water your fields in your own blood ? 
  is n't that rather counter-productive ? 
  would n't it be better to kill the invading enemy ? 
  it essentially means two things : 1 - you can try and kill us , we do n't really give a fuck . 
  2 - our sacrifice will only motivate us even more . 
  so you 're essentially leberhausen wearing xenomorphs ? 
  it will only be funnier !, 
  also , the `` impure blood '' is the blood of the french commoner , you did n't learn your lessons very well hans . 
   it 's only factors outside of the franco-german fight that cause germany to lose in some cases . 
  that 's a nice historical fallacy . 
  godamn , this makes me want to colonize africa and kill some germans . 
  cue `` that 's anti-semitic and/or islamophobic '' . 
  behold [ superdupont ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aeizc7k.jpg ) , the alcoholic , beret wearing , baguette eating macho . 
  yes , it really exists . 
  yes , they are very widespread , though it 's been a few years that they 're not accepted in supermarkets because people would sign * ch\u00e8ques en bois * ( literally `` wooden cheque '' ) or dud cheque . 
  to buy important or expensive things , to pay a tuition or a bail , to give money to their relatives , french people use cheques . 
  they do n't seem to understand that issuing `` threats '' is the surest way to have the people giving you the finger . 
  it 's hardly surprising though . 
  historically that 's what europe and being european means , you can whine about it all you want , i do n't care . 
  i really like this quote of charles de gaulle about france and i think that it applies rather well to europe as a whole . 
  `` france is an essentially white european country , with greco-roman culture and judeo-christian religion '' . 
  third generation immigrants . 
  they 're the worst . 
  it 's amazing how what he says is the exact opposite of reality , especially considering that the uk is one of the two eu countries with a good military . 
  your na\u00efvet\u00e9 is incredible . 
  would you believe a danish neo-nazi who went out on this way to kill non-aryans if he told you `` i support a 4th reich in germany but i want denmark to remain a social-democracy '' ? 
  let 's be real for a second damnit . 
   statistically , we 're far more likely to get blown up by a radical right-wing racist [ 1 ] than an islamic terrorist . 
  [ citation needed ] . 
  more `` think of the chillun '' bs . 
  [ there should be a `` nuke it '' option too ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vja0mgk.png ), 
  is n't that the handegg videogame ? 
  hmm there has been problems with the pak fa . 
  then again the same could be said about the f-35 . 
  not still . 
  let us enjoy the never-ending butthurt . 
  barroso is an imbecile . 
  they 're already usable . 
  how do you think people travel ? 
  all the informations needed are inside the passeport and already universally readable , you 'd know if you had taken a look . 
  ofc someone from an irrelevant country would say this . 
  see ? 
  i can be insulting too , 
  talk about cultural suicide . 
  it 's not ugly enough to be an official eu document . 
  you 're welcome ( i was sincere ) . 
   it seems that it is more important to sign things than to do things . 
  i think we already discussed it , but it is because the eu is much more of an ideological construction than a rational/realistic/pragmatic one . 
  just look at how our politicians pray to our new gods : father euro , mother austerity , and the holy spirit federalism . 
  you should rename yourself `` pragmatic realist serb '' . 
  oh i have no doubt they will sign whatever they are presented with ; they 'll just give up trying to act interested in what actual french people think about it like they did in 2005 . 
  assuming you guys are still in when the next diktat comes out . 
  it was you who brought up the 2005 cartoons . 
   `` the press freedom association '' , established as a reactionary response to the muhammad cartoon crisis of 2005 muslim terrorists issue fatwas and death threats because they flip their shit about some cartoons . 
  somehow when people react to this they 're racist , xenophobes and yadda yadda . 
  thanks for the quality post , i 'll read through . 
   if a poor section of usa is attacked , the other states do n't tell it to go fuck itself and mention all the tax revenue that gets paid towards them .
