  til a new reason to not vote for green party . 
  edit : brace myself , the downvotes are coming , downvotes from pro immigration because i dared to criticize a false good solution for refugees and downvotes from anti-immigration because i dared to call for a better solution for the refugees . 
  isis do not need to send agents with refugees : they have european citizens , citizens from other countries who could legally go to europe and brainwashed sleeping agents already in europe . 
  the only reason isis would make such a claim is that they want europeans to hate the refugees and create troubles in europe . 
  rejecting the refugees is playing isis ' game . 
  and kurdish plan to get rid of isis ? 
  let 's enjoy a dynamic war in which warmongers are renewed every 4 years !, 
  next shift : kurdish vs france vs russia . 
  make your bets !, 
  might be , but that would be a waste of efforts from isis . 
  they have already many europeans citizens , and citizens from safe countries who could legally go to europe . 
  and brainwashed people in europe ( from an interview from a former brainwashed teenager , isis now want their new members not to join syria but to act directly in europe since border controls are more aware of those teenagers ) . 
  so the only reason they would have to actually send people with the refugees would be to frighten europeans about immigrants and increase suspicion and hate . 
  hating those refugees is ** exactly ** what they want europeans to do . 
  that irritates me a lot . 
  when will people realize it 's really easy to lie ? 
  and that lies are meant to manipulate people . 
  the other day , i caught an islamophobic ( and a true one ) from ex-yougoslavia forging a false translation of a speech in arabic on youtube . 
  the best way is to ignore the enemies and go to check for source and facts . 
  turkey controls the sources of the tigris and euphrates through the control of the turkish kurdistan . 
  they use it for their agriculture and , in the future , as a diplomatic and economic threat and weapon on irak . 
  they would n't want to lose it . 
   opinions change when facts change . 
  about immigrations ? 
  nope . 
  it 's mainly emotional reactions from both sides . 
  it has been shown several times through economic and historical studies that , overall , immigration has a positive effect on the society . 
  not a huge one and with some costs , but they are n't the armaggedons many people describe . 
  it will probably a bit harsh to hear for some people , but the theories and `` intellectual '' constructions on reddit do n't occur in real-life . 
  what internet did is to improve our communication means , but did n't make people smarter . 
  result : hoaxes and false information spreads way faster and we need to answer to them with facts , logic , sources and comprehension if we want to have the tiniest effect against ignorance . 
  wow , i did n't even see it was n't linked to the current immigrant crisis . 
  i tried to find more information about how it ended but nothing . 
  yet my point was about :  we are called cold , emotionless machines of oppression that 's not because someone disagrees with you that they think what i quoted above . 
  you are quite a bit sensitive . 
  i got -28 in / r/worldnews for saying people riot because of their terrible socio-economic situation and not because they are muslims . 
  edit : just went through my history , it 's -40 actually . 
  about the eur debt crisis , some germans may have overinterpretated what eu was saying with titles like `` german chancelor to be harsh against greece '' . 
  most newspaper have been able to make the difference between the german people and merkel . 
  and the rest , it 's democracy , we still have the right to not agree with merkel politics as long as we have arguments ;p though she impressed me on the refugee crisis . 
  he was so smart he tried to invade a military ally of france and bombed 2 civilian planes . 
   ( last after wwii )  to teach younger generations our history that 's what we want you to think ... 
  the only thing which survives longer than a society is its culture and its historical sites . 
  nobody cares about the american growth in the 19th century and its 19th century corporations , but in us everyone knows who is poe . 
   coming ** directly ** from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened what does that mean here ? 
  physically directly ( since turkey is safe ) ? 
  or without having asked asylum to another country ? 
  a refugee moving from turkey to germany is still a refugee . 
  that 's a fact , not an opinion . 
  i am asking europe to ship some growth to france as a sign of solidarity . 
  #bringbackcavemen # 15000bctraditions being fully white and fully christian ( which already is n't the case anymore with atheism ) does n't matter to have a good society . 
  living up to its values does . 
  and the rest of what you said belongs in the trash . 
  bombs , bullets and hunger does n't make the difference between a young male adult and an old woman . 
  it 's not because he would have more chance of surviving in the wild that he is n't in need . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfumw_mf5qc ;p, 
  i have checked his profile : - he does n't seem to watch any videos in arabic - one of the 2 political videos he subscribed to is `` islam will take over the world in 50 years '' - he subscribed to a lot of videos about ex-yougoslavia and in what looks like an ex-yougoslavia language ( and among them the famous `` remove kebab '' ) sounds a lot like bullshit . 
  source : https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucydyk41jggk_feyn8lbefog/playlists edit : for the fun , i can do like him : [ french crusaders on their way to mecca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le2tgb-k-n4 ) oh p\u00e9tain oh p\u00e9tain we will die for you victory shall be ours pagans should fall for god oh p\u00e9tain oh p\u00e9tain and so on, 
  most people do n't have loans on fields , farm tractors , milking devices or herds . 
  all of this is capital in which farmer invested that they can only sell to other farmers , or let go . 
  yet they have to pay their loan . 
  unpopular opinion on this reddit here . 
  most farmers took loans to buy their farm or invest in it . 
  selling their farm is n't a solution since it only moves the problem to another person ( the one buying the farm is taking a loan ) . 
  and no one will buy a farm to do nothing with it . 
  so those farmers have to make money out of their exploitation . 
  but they are selling at loss their production , because of surproduction/competition from schengen/competition from south america . 
  they are qualified farmers , not qualified traders or qualified physicists so they ca n't have highly paid jobs outside of their farm . 
  how are they supposed to get out of their situation ? 
  so , my opinion is , in a first time , we should hasten the economic and social standardization of the schengen market ( which was the goal of schengen at the beginning ) to compete on the same field . 
  i remember telling a friend of mine 3 years ago , at the beginning of the civil war , that assad would win the war . 
  he would n't believe me . 
  it begins nowadays . 
  there is a plain simple reason : assad ca n't lose . 
  after the fall of gaddafi , russian and china ( and especially russia ) would have never let another ally fall . 
  the diplomatic outrage was too high to accept another one . 
  to add to this , isis ca n't win because if they begin to win , they will face a coalition since nobody has interests to see them winning , even gulf nations . 
  it let syrian moderate rebels to win against assad . 
  but at the second nato refused to give them weaponry and bomb assad troops , there was no way they could win . 
  the rest was a matter of time . 
  it reminds about the americans freaking out about illegaly killing american citizens abroad or illegaly listening american citizens ... while not giving a flying fuck for the other nationalities . 
  spy all europeans ? 
  spy one american ? 
  it 's immoral !, 
  what i mean is at least uk are coherent . 
  you join an organization at war with us ? 
  ok , here is a bomb , like any other person at war with us . 
  that would have been some new record to not kill an isis member because he was from uk . 
  it depends on how much sanctions he wants to lift , but it can be a lot wiser move than what people see at first glance . 
  if russia does respect the ceasefire and west does n't lift any sanctions : - west saying that sanctions are about russia agression of ukraine becomes absolute bullshit - russia ca n't trust west to remove the sanctions if they completely bring back peace to ukraine a desescalation of the sanctions following the desescalation of the conflict is necessary if we really want to diplomatically put an end to the conflict . 
  though only respecting the ceasefire is n't enough to justify a huge sanction lifting . 
  like i said , it 's all about balance . 
  perfect place to build a spanish parking imo . 
  i am provoking you voluntarily : define on a legal plan what is demeaning for women . 
  it 's just a piece of cloth . 
  i guess it 's very easy and unrisky to receive one through the national post service . 
  and for the police , it 's a bit more complicated . 
  on a everyday basis , policemen do n't want to create trouble to enforce a law which was voted for political reasons . 
  but sometimes they do . 
  at the beginning , some people would be arrested , only to have a group of people protesting against the police ( not necessarily violently ) .
