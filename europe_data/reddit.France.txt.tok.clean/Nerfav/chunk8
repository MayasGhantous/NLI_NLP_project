  they are n't filled with thousands of isis members , but they are few extremists there . 
  the wolf is already among the sheep . 
  candidates in local elections have a more serious program than him . 
  culture does n't sum up to cinema and even to art  .  for art : the obvious stromae , the countless festivals around the country , the french house . 
  for society : 11th january , 4 millions frenchmen gathered to demonstrate in reaction to the charlie hebdo attack . 
  of course , seen from the outside , it looks a lot like the french clich\u00e9 of strikes and demonstrations . 
  but actually it 's a result of a mix of reasons which go deeply in the french history . 
  the republic was built around the idea of `` liberty equality and fraternity '' and laws . 
  recently , there has been a strong contestation against the republican idea . 
  4 millions frenchmen gathered to say `` fuck you terrorists , we wo n't give up free speech '' . 
  4 millions frenchmen gathered to say `` fuck you terrorists , we wo n't surrender to fear '' . 
  4 millions frenchmen gathered to say `` fuck you nationalists , we wo n't give up our republic '' . 
  but yeah , france is close to become a generic country , of course . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/opinion/nicholas-kristof-the-most-important-thing-and-its-almost-a-secret.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1 there is a bias . 
  i am french and things are really okay . 
  but it 's easy to get clicks by announcing the end of the french culture/country whatever because of its former first class world power rank and its romance . 
  good , take justin bieber and one direction , we keep stromae . 
  actually in france we are offended because all the refugees are going to germany while france used to have an important flux of immigrants . 
  which means a lot about the economy and the image of france !, 
  and also xenophobics do n't have their daily immigrants to fuel their speech anymore . 
  seriously , fuck those surinamese , i never know if it 's a country or a japanese dish !, 
  country : france favourite : belgium ( stromae , fries and mostly because we have good jokes about them  .  ) least : swiss ( because i had to choose one country ), 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about northseaers , you little rosbif ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on greenpeace boats , and i have over 300 confirmed sinkings . 
  i am trained in submarine warfare and i 'm the top fisher in the entire ns armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that to me over the internet ? 
  think again , jelly eater . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of catfish across the oceans and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call english gastronomy . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the dolphin armed forces and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable swimming team off the face of the olympics games . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price . 
  not true , it exists in english too : `` bring me the bordeaux ! '', 
  that 's only my personal taste , but the `` french movie '' is most of the time focused around a group of 3-4 characters and their relations . 
  i remember one good film using this : `` intouchables '' . 
  3 are right now on the first page of the movies in theater on allocine . 
  while in the meantime , hollywood developed the 3d , made 3 historical movies about the roots of the current american society . 
  and maestro created many tubes about the problem of the youth and of the less young . 
  is it so hard to stop using an overused scheme ? 
  just nationalists showing the depth of their inconsistency and stupidity again . 
  `` visible '' culture is more homogenized , but actually , when you go into less visible culture , french culture is still renewing itself while using new technologies . 
  there are tons of festivals of geek festivals , [ celtic festivals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z593ihlhr4s ) , specific use of new trends to [ roleplay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jixb1pajmqy ) . 
  also , do n't forget that a part of the global culture is [ french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_house ) . 
  though french cinema is a shame , but it has always been the case . 
  while technologic differences between cultures are reducing , the way they are used matter more to differentiate cultures . 
  edit : also , mainstream media use the same sure stuff to make money , so it 's normal it 's standardized through europe . 
  though it does n't stop artists to make original creations , it 's those guys you need to find . 
  maybe you missed the top comment then . 
  fun fact : when the farmers were protesting in paris , r/europe and r/worldnews were mocking them , blaming them and refusing to understand them . 
  now that there is an article on their suicides and financial problems , everyone is like `` oh poor guys . '', 
  fucking inconsistent people always following the wind . 
  you posted another answer , then deleted it , then posted a new one with the same stupid iphone 6 argument . 
  why would you assume they have iphone 6 in particular ? 
  medium ? 
  they most probably have the iphone 5 or iphone 4 or iphone 3 back from syria . 
  for one day , if people could stop coming with this stupid argument , that would be wonderful . 
  question : when your house is in fire , what is the first thing you grab before fleeing ? 
  your smartphone . 
  i am not saying all refugees are in this case , but that does n't mean no refugees with smartphones need help . 
  a pinnacle of good taste . 
  monaco . 
  butthurt much ? 
  i did n't say anything about femen because they are well known . 
  but you directly jumped to r/conspiracy , which says a lot about how much you have been brainwashed and conditioned . 
  there are so many random stuff in france you ca n't really know what is going on : - a set for a film - a protest from an [ extreme right group ] ( http://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/var/nrv2_archive/storage/images/contenus/articles/2013/10/20/generation-identitaire-cree-une-section-a-poitiers-1656939/30916774-1-fre-fr/generation-identitaire-cree-une-section-a-poitiers_reference.jpg ) - an operation from the [ femen ] ( http://static.ripostelaique.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/femen2-1-5.jpg ) - a weird advertisement campaign - a coup from some conspirationist guys in the district, 
  nadine morano is the populist face of the ex-ump right party . 
  whenever she talks , i always think about [ this scene in twd the videogame ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otkxewkjwro ) . 
  yes , i know , that 's why  a majority of wallons were against the split of belgium  if i did n't feel the need to say everything : http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/region/actualite/secteur_region/2008/07/29/article_un-wallon-sur-deux-pret-a-devenir-franca.shtml, 
  personally , if they ask for it , yes . 
  and 60 to 66 % of the french agree with me . 
  wallons speak french , have a close culture with the northern french , have a lot in common history-wise . 
  there might be some society questions on which there are disagreements but france already has regions with legal specifities ( corsica , alsace ) . 
  and it would be stupid to force the wallons in their own state for fews debatable questions . 
  that 's ugly to make me agree with far right propositions . 
   if belgium were to split , i know that the status of a largely francophone brussels within flanders is an issue . 
  it becoming an independent city-state , a multilingual symbol of and eventual de jure capital of the eu , is a possibility . 
  would wallonia and flanders become separate nations , or would they join france and the netherlands ? 
  would france and the netherlands want to absorb their neighbors ? 
  one year ago , i found a poll ( i do n't remember the date of the poll though ) which was saying that a majority of wallons were against the split of belgium , but if it happened , a majority would be in favor of joining france . 
  i am not against an eu army on the paper , but it largely depends who or what controls it . 
  it 's nice to say that we are all fighting in the same army , but that army has to be useful . 
  france had been able to quickly intervene in mali and central africa , operations that were necessary to prevent 2 human disasters . 
  when djihadists tried to move south to bamako , hollande authorized the army to intervene and a few hours later the djihadists column were under fire from attack helicopters . 
  i do n't trust german/austrian/scandinavians politicians to be brave enough to quickly allow an intervention or a military operation . 
  they come from countries in which the political climate opposes foreign military interventions . 
  which will translate in reluctance for an intervention , which could be counter-productive . 
  if this army follows the orders of a small leadership , it would be okay . 
  if it requires the approval of several countries or a vote from the european parliament , it 's not worth it ; why ? 
  it would instantly turn into a parliamentary trench warfare or in a struggle between countries . 
  i am not as worried by marine le pen as president than trump as president : - she is a much smarter politician than her father , and knows than even if she somehow wins the elections , that does n't mean that a majority of the french support all her ideas . 
  example : she supported a referendum to leave the eu , but not to leave the eu because a majority ( 60 % + ) is against leaving the eu but in favor of a referendum . 
  - right after the presidential election , there are the legislative elections . 
  it relies on small districts electing a rep which is then sent to the national assembly . 
  so far , the fn only has 4 and would have to compete against popular local figures in numerous districts with completely unknown fn candidates . 
  i am not sure she can get the majority she needs at the national assembly . 
  - and then there is the senate , which are elected by locally elected reps ( mayors , members of city councils , etc ) . 
  fn has 0 influence in the senate .
