  in the end , that means that even if she becomes president , she would n't be able to make a pure fn policy as the 2 chambers would block most of her laws and even could bring down her gov if she tries to abuse the 49.3 ( a law that allows the gov to pass laws without vote ) . 
  also , the minister and prime ministers , by republican habit , are from the party which is in majority at the national assembly , which has led in the past to cohabitations between a socialist/right-wing president and a right-wing/socialist gov. 
  in this case , that could be even worse without clear majority at the national assembly . 
  plus it 's unlikely anyone will want to form a majority with the fn alone . 
  that 's why i think that , if she wins , there will be 1-2 months of legislative blocking and then she will make the choice of a government of `` national union '' . 
  this concept dates from wwi when the parties agreed to suspend elections ( because , you know , general mobilization ) and work together to win the war . 
  no idea .

  i was talking about the map . 
  corsica painted as speaking italian . 
  some wiki contributors are going to lose their vacation homes soon . 
  anyone can explain what are all those lines ( between points and compass roses ) ? 
  at first i thought they could be landmarks for which the mapper had the coordinates ( by `` simply '' observing stars ) to draw his map , but some of them are in the middle of the sea , so that would be awful landmarks . 
  and why would they be joined to the compass roses ? 
  edit : actually all points are compass roses , just not drawn as it . 
  i have some ideas : the mapper put a point in the middle of the map , and drew a circle around it . 
  the diameter of the circle matches the height of the sheet of paper . 
  exactly like a compass ross , he put 16 points on the circle , at regular distances . 
  he drew lines between all those 17 points and vertical and horizontal lines on each point , making the grid that way , except for some of the points . 
  the rest is [ celestial navigation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celestial_navigation ) . 
  nobody asked you to destroy rome : /, 
  mali , central africa , various other operations , letting his elite minister of defense handle the minister of defense ( this minister made a lot of deals , and despite his will to leave the minister to manage the region he is charge of , they forced him to stay ) , homosexual marriage , standard and poor stabilizing its note of france . 
  there other debatable things such as : handling of the terrorist attacks and [ the saving of greece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h638mauyy8 ) ( parody ) . 
  i think he has been crippled by a part of his ministers ( royal , valls , montebourg ) but also had found good team members ( sapin , le drian , le foll , taubira until she left ) . 
  imo , he made some mistakes over taxation , syria and lately removing of citizenship ( which led to taubira leaving ) but was also let down by his own poor communication . 
  overall i think history will remember him as a decent president . 
  because presidents are elected for 5 years and it 's more dissatisfaction than anger . 
  well i guess we should have sent a lot of kitten photos to alqaeda to ask them to stop their invasion of mali . 
  after the datation with c-14 , archeologists in the future will use the t-34 datation for the third millenium by checking how many t-34 were used in an event .

  [ finnish intensifies ] ( http://image.slidesharecdn.com/finland2-140227013416-phpapp02/95/-6-638.jpg?cb=1393465076 ), 
  to keep cards in our hand ? 
  how is it a good thing to have even less options ? 
  candidates come , we can then say yes or no . 
  but if you deter anyone from applying , you are stuck into a situation . 
  great strategy . 
  i think that eu ca n't openly humiliate turkey by directly rejecting all their demands because , otherwise , it could deter other fringe countries from applying to the eu . 
  that depends a lot on the role given to the president . 
  it has taken decades in france to settle the balance between the president and the parliament . 
  on the organization of the vote , people could vote the same day for both the parliament and the president . 
  but it brings the question on how would the president build his majority . 
  which brings the question on who can and how to run to a mep siege . 
  there have already been cases of cohabitations ( ie a parliament with a different majority than the party of the president ) and luckily the country was n't wiped ( yet ) . 
  so it 's totally doable . 
  if there is no clear majority in the parliament , if the president is indirectly elected meps have to play politician games and trade support and alliances in order to elect the president for five years . 
  it has already happened a lot of times in various countries that no majority could be found ( belgium  .  ) . 
  with a directly elected president , you have someone with 100 % odds and 100 % legitimacy to represent whatever he/she represents * edit * ( country , union ) . 
  and he/she passed the trial by people , so every citizen had a chance to make its choice . 
  i am not fond of having the president indirectly elected . 
  that would be a net loss of control by citizens who directly elect their head of state . 
  on the other hand , i do n't see why having a president directly elected would bother people used to indirectly elected head of the states ( by head of state , i mean the holding the highest constitutionnal powers , would it be a prime minister , a president , or whatever ) . 
  it could also boost interest and investment from the public in eu-wide politics . 
  and boost the interest of candidates in each country . 
  seeing how counter-productive their foreign interventions have been in the last 20 years , i say `` yes , come to us ! '' . 
  we would get a federal communist utopia in the following months :d ( to be perfectly honest , their strategy in yemen against al qaeda was effective ... until the civil war kicked in ), 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmyuog9s-y4 ) was on r/france recently . 
  the famas was designed during an area in which the french doctrina was still to have a lot of conscripts and potentially a full mobilization , and the famas looks like it would have perfectly fit for such a doctrina ( small , can be handled by right-handed and left-handed , semi-auto and burst for unskilled shooters ) . 
  now the french army is fully professional , and the last operations saw the extensive use of special forces and of highly trained and specialized units . 
  it does n't really make sense anymore to have such a rifle , and logically , the army had to go for a different style of weapon . 
  the real problem is to not have any serious small arms manufacturer in france anymore . 
  hopefully the harmonization of european armies and diplomacy would solve this problem , and that 's why i was rooting for the hk416 . 
   not to mention we wo n't have money to defend nato [ you serious ? 
  ] ( http://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-19-at-9.38.26-pm.png ) if you worry about military expanditures boosting us debt , ask your gov and military leaders what they are doing with all this money . 
  vows . 
  sarkozy is a candidate , but he has n't any legislative power . 
  that 's wishful thinking . 
  random dude thinks that  all country is like that . 
  the funny part is that it shows the cartoonist did n't understand the context . 
  he is showing the national police ( under the responsability of the minister of the interior , so the gov ) while the polemic was about municipal decisions applied by municipal police under the responsability of the mayor . 
  and hollande has been very quiet about this matter . 
  it 's not about the gov banning the burkini , it 's about mayors in some cities taking the decision of banning the burkini and the french administrative justice system checking in the legality of the process . 
  paul bismuth is building a wall to hide from judges . 
  i went through his post historic , that 's quite weird . 
  not everything is religion related . 
  countries are n't defined by religion alone . 
  it 's probably more a minor yet important part than the definition of the country in most cases . 
  oh , and about the spanish natural enemies of the moroccans , time to refresh your international relations knowledge to xxith century standards .

  yes , there is that too . 
  i completely forgot about them . 
  it has been cleaned . 
  it was n't cleaned during a while because it was the gathering place or memorial for the bataclan attack . 
  obviously some people profited of it to tag it . 
  stop using internet explorer . 
  you would have to ask to policemen . 
  i just read the law on legifrance , it 's anything made to hide the face in public which is forbidden . 
  and the niqab covers the face so yes , it 's banned . 
  and the furries are banned too . 
  damn furries and their hidden faces . 
  actually the law says `` nobody can , in the public space , wear an outfit made to hide the face '' ( article 1 of the law ) . 
  it 's not an outfit `` which hides the face '' but `` made to hide the face '' so apparently there is a need for an intent . 
  ban the niqab !,
