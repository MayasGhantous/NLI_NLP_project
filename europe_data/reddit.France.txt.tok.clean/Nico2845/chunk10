   i do n't owe you or anyone a nice handholding explanation every bloody time you shit on my society . 
  i shit on your society ? 
  did you take the little pills the doctor gave you ? 
   now go away . 
  from the internet or from you ? 
  do n't complain people keep spreading bullshit about your country when your reply to them like that when they ask questions about something else than your food or your historical monuments . 
  expect many more documentaries , articles and even maybe one day a hollywood movie that will infuriate you . 
  i felt sorry for you when i read your post with all these details and dates !, 
  very interesting . 
  how much was the pay ? 
  you misunderstood him , he said built ** in ** 1942 , like in the middle the war . 
  we know there are older buildings in europe ... 
   makes sense . 
  please educate us more . 
   so every fascist group in europe is their equivalent . 
  their equivalent but not the same , fascists movements vary a lot depending on the country they come from . 
  so for example wearing a t-shirt with an ustashe symbol will get you in trouble ? 
  the point is pegida or the afd or the fn of the english defence league or jobbik are all far right movement but are very different and perceived differently . 
  so apparently no one here wants to talk about how usta\u0161e are perceived today in croatia , i guess i 'll stick with the foreign media afterall considering either croatians are spewing insults or refuse to even explain the context . 
  you do n't see that in threads about nationalists movements in other countries , at least locals explain what 's what . 
   `` anyway i watched a documentary a few months ago on croatia '' ** and i do n't know what to make of it ** because it 's one of the classic `` there is a dark-side to paradise '' bullshit documentary . 
   i 'm local , and of `` unwanted '' ethnicity . 
   you have some problems , buddy . 
  yeah and so far you just gave some bullshit links to neo-nazis groups in other european countries . 
  the same exact thing happened in every single european country after the end of wwii ? 
  the nationalists movements are all 100 % similar in every single european country ? 
  did every single european country experienced ethnic cleansing in the past decades ? 
  so why do you just dismiss everything by a : `` pffff anyway there are nationalists like everywhere else '' ? 
  i do n't know much about usta\u0161e , there is no equivalent in europe outside the balkans and suddenly it 's the same than an anti-isra\u00ebl movement in france and an anti-muslim movement in germany ? 
  do germans and french people perceive this groups exactly like usta\u0161e are perceived today in croatia as well ? 
  you have a serbian flag that says you 're an expat , how am i supposed to know it represents your ethnicity and you live in croatia ? 
   from there on , it 's up to the media how to portray it . 
  a small group might become big news , a mountain can be made out of a molehill , and tsar putin may label the entire ukranian nation as neo-nazi if he wishes to do so , based on a single batallion of ukraine paramilitary fighting there . 
  ok , you really do n't get it . 
  ** i specifically do n't give a shit what the media say about this ** , that 's why i asked my question to a croatian to have the opinion of a local . 
   but if you want things more directly : no . 
  not there , not anywhere else in europe is nazism and fascism a serious problem . 
  next time do n't even bother to reply when you do n't have shit to say on a subject , seriously . 
  yeah , thank you i know that all countries have neo-nazi groups , that was n't my question . 
  do n't you have still a lot of people openly celebrating usta\u0161e ? 
  it 's a honest question , i do n't know much about croatia and i know how annoying it can be when foreign media get something wrong about your country . 
  anyway i watched a documentary a few months ago on croatia . 
  the kind of sunday-night documentary about croatia , its beautiful beaches , its beautiful cities , its beautiful cities ... 
  but !, 
  tadadaaaaaam !, 
  there also this and that and actually croatia is not the paradise that you would think !, 
  well , i 'm sure you see the kind i 'm talking about . 
  there was a part about festivals where people where drinking and partying , young and old , singing old usta\u0161e songs and wearing some symbols as well . 
  several young people were interviewed and said that usta\u0161e were good for croatia and they 're heroes , etc. . . can you explain the situation a bit ? 
  i honestly do n't know what to make of it . 
   the uk is still going to be in the wto . 
  french people are still going to be able to buy things from the uk once we leave the eu . 
  trade is going to continue . 
  yes , with the ** basic ** rules of the wto that are shitty . 
   the single market does not increase trade . 
  no need to read any further . 
   no - i actually understand what passporting involves . 
  the city of london is a global financial centre . 
  we deal with counterparties from all over the world . 
  confirmed : you do n't know what passporting rights are , and do n't understand the consequences of losing them . 
   the eu does not have free trade deals with usa , new zealand or japan in place . 
  yet trade happens . 
  there is a difference between a free-trade deal like the ttip and a trade deal we already have with the us through the wto , like the eu -- us open skies agreement . 
  these wto agreements took decades to be put in place , but why am i surprised you 're clueless about that ? 
   not really . 
  the uk will keep on importing stuff from the eu because the uk is committed to free trade . 
  i would be surprised if the eu wanted to harm eu consumers of uk products . 
  but the very fact that the eu is so full of people like you who are not committed to free trade is exactly why the uk needed to leave . 
  so ... you want to leave the eu and the single market , the latter sole purpose being to maximise free trade through common regulations , but somehow we are not committed to free trade ? 
  i really feel for all the brits who tried to reason with brexiters , the level of stupidity is staggerring . 
   i do know what passporting rights are . 
  i am a lawyer working in financial services . 
  then there are 2 options , you 're either a lier or a terrible lawyer . 
   companies all over the world trade with the single market but are not in it . 
  are you aware of this fact ? 
  i just bought a computer from the usa , wine from new zealand and i am just about to sell legal services to japan . 
  none of these are in the single market . 
  are you aware of the fact we have trade deals with these countries that took years to become reality ? 
  are you aware that if the uk trades with the eu under basic wto rules it will get completely economically crushed ? 
   the eu thinks of london as being the eu financial capital . 
  it is n't . 
  it is a global financial centre . 
  finance is not european , it is global . 
  french banks do n't just lend in the eu , they lend globally . 
  german companies do n't just borrow from the eu , they borrow globally . 
  to access global finance , they use a global financial centre . 
  which one are they going to use if they stop using london ? 
  you apparently do n't know what passporting rights are , it 's pointless to talk with you . 
   the uk should have the ability to re-write the full spectrum of regulation covering the single market . 
  so you want your own regulation , good , but then no trade with the single market since you do n't want to adopt our regulations . 
  with whom do you trade then ? 
  also regarding regulation of financial services , do n't expect to be the eu finance capital once you 're out , it wo n't happen , especially if you 're not even in the single market . 
  it 's not that the geneva convention is `` not so much about refugees '' , it has literally nothing to do with refugees and the word itself is n't mention a single time . 
  what regulation ? 
  and what do you gain from leaving the single market exactly ? 
  well , no matter what we have limited capacities so as you say , it would be extremely complicated , more than it already is . 
  i do n't think the us will ever go for an isolationist policy ever though , they have too many interests abroad . 
  even if trump is elected , the military -- industrial complex will destroy him if he tries to remove strategic military positions . 
  and considering how he is continuously whining about china , i 'll doubt he 'll do anything to weaken the us in the region anyway . 
  i 'm surprised r/ireland has less than us , especially with all the 1/32 irish americans .
