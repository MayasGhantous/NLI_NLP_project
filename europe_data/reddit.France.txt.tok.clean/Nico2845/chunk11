  2012 is not a very good example because it was a year with a very harsh winter , it was an exception . 
  [ you can look there in this 2014 report from edf ( page 10 ) . 
  ] ( http://www.rte-france.com/sites/default/files/2015_01_27_pk_rte_2014_french_electricity_report.pdf )  net exports averaged over the month were greater than 5 gw throughout the year , including in winter . 
  france had to import around thirty terra-watt hours in the year ** without a day of net energy imports . 
  ** to say that french exports are not available during winter is not true at all , you have plenty of exports but colder regions are obviously going to have an increase in demand so some will have to import . 
   france was n't part of nato at that time ( we just joined back a few year back and the treaty in question was in 93 ) wrong again , france never left nato it left nato ** integrated command ** . 
  proving you 're dumb as fuck once again . 
  you know what ? 
  let 's put an end to this by playing a little game . 
  you 're gon na go back on the wikipedia [ budapest memorandum on security assurances article . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances#content ) then you 're going to do a little keyword search for the word `` nato '' . 
  then you come back to tell me how many times the word is mentioned . 
  hint : `` nato '' is ** not mentioned a single time ** , because it has nothing to do with nato , exposing your staggering stupidity and ignorance for one last time . 
  i 'm off . 
  so what does it tell you if 2 members of an alliance sign an agreement , and a third one a different version of the agreement and 25 members do n't sign anything ? 
   china and ** france ** gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents . 
  france itself did n't have the same documents than the us and uk . 
  indeed you should do a bit of reading . 
  two sentences actually if you 're capable of that . 
  please continue this is fun . 
  it 's more complicated than lacking capacity actually . 
  for example in 2014 we produced an extra 75,3 twh . 
  yet we imported 27,3 twh from the uk , spain , italy , belgium , germany and switzerland . 
  there is some reasons for it , like a nuclear reactor stopped for a little while , a very cold winter or a very dry summer ( hydroelectricity that does n't give as much ) . 
  and another big reason is sometimes it 's just cheaper to buy abroad electricity because prices change constantly . 
  but we do n't really lack capacity , we still export massively . 
  so this is not nato . 
  do you think nato agreements are signed only by the us , france and the uk without spain , italy , germany or poland having a say ? 
  are you going to continue forever to expose your stupidity ? 
  genuine question , are people generally opposed to nuclear energy in the netherlands ? 
  i always pictured it as the land of windmill . 
   i hope it 's not going to be imported electricity from foreign ~ ~ coal ~ ~ ** nuclear ** plants . 
   the memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers , the russian federation , the united states of america , and the united kingdom . 
  china and france gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents . 
  it 's the first paragraph of ** your ** link , ** this is not nato ** . 
  i think your username perfectly checks out , your brain has a problem . 
  in the long run you 'll beg to come back and we 'll have a new de gaulle to say `` no , you 're on your own this time ! '', 
  you do n't understand us , that 's why you 're leaving :(, 
   the eu does not have a top ten global financial centre . 
  the eu does not have a top ten global financial centre ** according to a british index . 
  ** ftfy [ chinese/american index thinks we have two . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_centre#international_financial_centres_development_index ), 
   the global financial centres index is compiled semi-annually by the ** london-based british ** think-tank z/yen surprise surprise , british index putting down paris . 
  interestingly , [ when we look at the international financial centres development index , that is compiled annually by the xinhua news agency of china with the chicago mercantile exchange and dow jones & company of the united states , paris is just below shanghai . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_centre#international_financial_centres_development_index ) who do i trust ? 
  our british neighbours who constantly shit on us or the chinese and americans ? 
  i do n't think paris is going to replace london as the financial capital ( ever , brexit or not ) , but if you think paris is a smaller financial center than casablanca you 're absolutely delusional . 
  hell , paris alone has a gdp five times ** bigger ** than all of morocco 's and the district of la d\u00e9fense has probably more financial activity than all of the maghreb region . 
  nice counter-argument . 
   fought for fucks sake . 
  still no example to provide i see . 
   read your own post , then come back . 
  you might notice that there is another paragraph that mentioned  `` that perfectly worked in afghanistan for example . '', 
   seriously , if you 're forgetting about half the shit you wrote , you might not be fit for a debate . 
  my mistake on that one . 
  my point still stands , nato has been successfully able to deploy massively thousands of kilometers away for an invasion , care to explain why it would n't be able to do the same for a ** defensive ** intervention in europe ? 
  regardless of russia being obviously more military capable than the talibans , i do n't see how a country incapable to successfully take control of a small part of ukraine would succeed in taking over a country that has full nato support . 
  please lecture me on this . 
   lol right then . 
  nice counter-argument again , am i talking to a teenager ? 
  please explain to me how the us + uk + france do n't make up 90 % of nato . 
   aside from the fact that the british people demand no military action being taken without parliament approval , which would extend to article 5 or that the potential next us president wo n't give two shits about nato . 
  but sure , 90 % not a single thing suggest in this that article 5 would need parliament approval in your irrelevant article . 
  nato is mentioned once :  the difference of a year is striking . 
  russian interference in ukraine has jolted ** nato ** into bolstering its defence of eastern europe , with substantial british troop commitments and little resistance from public or parliament . 
  article 5 ? 
  never . 
  absolutely irrelevant source you should have read before . 
  but you know when article 5 was triggered ? 
  for the war in afghanistan . 
  the british parliament was never consulted and [ you can read here what happens when the nato council decides to trigger it . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2006/issue2/english/art2.html ) that is a fact , not something i pulled out of my ass like your entire gibberish . 
  thank you for exposing your staggering ignorance on the subject . 
   and yet parliaments still talk about as to uphold democracy . 
  what ? 
   who ever mentioned a majority ? 
  i said `` opposition '' , not majority . 
  get your eyes checked . 
  you said :  because now you not only have very little support if you have very little support , you do n't have a majority in parliament . 
  and again , the fn currently has 2 mps out of 577 . 
  the afd has none . 
  but sure , they 'll be a strong opposition in german and french parliaments . 
  no fear mongering and fantasy here . 
   the threat of both far-left and far-right extremists being armed by russia in case of a war , to create a `` homefront '' . 
  yeah , guerilla far-left and far-right movements armed by russia in france and germany . 
  again , no fear mongering at all , a totally realistic projection . 
  aaaaaand again , ukraine and georgia are not in nato or the eu so most of your points are totally irrelevant to the baltic states situation . 
  and there is a deterrent , i never said there was n't any or that they should n't be , russia did n't touch a nato member in 67 years because of the nuclear deterrent , and it will continue to do so especially considering how miserable russia is today compared to the ussr position . 
   elsass-lothringen has always been a contest between prussia/germany and france . 
  just like russia has always seeked a natural baltic seaport . 
  or , you know , how they annexed a pretty substantial part of ukraine for the seaport there . 
  oh so you are telling me we should beware of germany invading us anytime soon to seize alsace-lorraine . 
  ok . and for the 13395854th time , ukraine is not in nato or the eu , so it 's a completely irrelevant example in our discussion . 
   and even in 2016 large-scale conflicts are still won by armies . 
  who consist of soldiers . 
  more soldiers + modern equipment = better protection against threats . 
  less soldiers + modern equipment = worse protection . 
  my god that was difficult ... 
  yes , please tell me about these modern conflicts between major nuclear powers that are won by little green men . 
   what are you even talking about ?
