  would n't you be shocked to realise one morning someone took 1 % of your money at the bank for example ? 
   germany already produces the french nuclear warheads where the hell did you read this nonsense ? 
  why do you keep repeating other countries are favoured by indians for immigration ? 
  it 's irrelevant , i know there are more indians in the us or the middle east , this is not what we 're discussing . 
  and yes , most of the one who come in france , either chinese or indians , and under-educated . 
  this is easily to see it where you look at where the vast majority lives , aka in the cheapest neighbourhoods . 
  maybe you heard about chinese protesting in france recently because of the attacks they 've been victims of ? 
  well guess what , they do n't live in projects in aubervilliers , a shitty suburban town with one of the highest crime rate of the country , because they make a good salary working as engineers for renault or airbus . 
   do n't conflate the current refugee situation with immigration . 
  i 'm not conflating anything , i do n't know why you bring up refugees into this i did n't talk about it . 
  indians and chinese are not among refugees . 
  go to the indian neighbourhood in paris or the chinese one , i 'll let you guess if all the people around you have master degrees . 
   i feel like france would have to cede control of it 's arsenal to the eu . 
  yeah that will never happen . 
  you are talking about us immigration , which carefully selects immigrants . 
  that has nothing to do with immigration in europe , that does n't select as much and takes a lot of uneducated immigrants , including from india or china . 
  thanks for the links , but i happen to know where the atlantic , the north sea and the channel are . 
   maybe you are a belgian , that is sitting comfortably at the shores of the atlantic , thinking `` why should i defend estonia ? '' . 
  so you think belgium has an atlantic shore ? 
  good , good , let me finish reading your expert opinion on european matters . 
  nato is not only a deterrent though . 
  it 's possible but you do n't want to hear it . 
  keep telling yourself french basques are oppressed second-class citizens , it 's not like your opinion or mine matter to them , they just do n't give a shit about everything you 're saying they suffer from and it must be sad for you to see they do n't feel like you do . 
  you seem to fail to understand there is no broad support for this in the french part . 
  they 're french , speak french and some of them speak basque as well , and they 're happy about it . 
  i know you refuse to believe it , but that 's the truth . 
  none of them feels like a second-class citizen , this is absolute bullshit and you know it . 
   i already know what is the situation with the two pieces of the basque country . 
  i also know that french basques do not want independence . 
  but you can want to be french and also be able to speak basque . 
  those things are not incompatible . 
  well , you can , so what 's the problem ? 
  you just have to use french for administrative stuffs and that 's it . 
  you can live your whole life speaking only basque if you want . 
   no , it 's not . 
  eta bombings were not commonplace in france because , until recently , most eta members traditionally used france as a place to hide , this started during the francoism and continued until the 90s . 
  most eta meetings and congresses took place openly in france . 
  also , iparretarrak existed and was active in france . 
  you recognized it yourself : the french basques do not want independence and never did . 
  that 's it , without public support the eta could n't do much and did n't do much , just like iparretarrak . 
  yeah , indians and chinese are all engineers , never seen any indian running a shitty grocery store in london or a chinese working in a sweatshop in a shitty suburb of paris . 
   yet france still refuses to give regional languages any legal recognition . 
  i agree they should be recognize legally . 
  that would n't change shit , but i agree . 
   any basque person should have the right to receive medical attention in basque or to have their children in basque schools without having to search for the handful of schools that teach it ( due to the limited funding : there is actually more demand for basque education than basque schools available ) , sometimes outside of their own hometowns . 
  no , they 're french-basque and the official language is french . 
  again , that would have made sense a century ago to have public services in regional languages , now it 's non-sense . 
  and i 'm sure they can find a doctor that speaks basque if they 're so obsessed with having everything offered in basque . 
  and we have limited funding for public schools period in france . 
  some schools do n't have heating in marseille , so it 's not exactly a top priority . 
  and i 'm sure if there was such a huge demand , we would see massive protests there and people gathering to fund private billingual schools everywhere . 
  but it 's not happening , is it . 
   i 've met french basques who attended the university of the basque country in the spanish basque country because that was the only way they had to receive tertiary education in basque . 
  there is no public university in the french basque country , so even for tertiary education in french you would have to move somewhere else . 
  apparently , you 're part of these spanish basques who think the basque country is one and united . 
  newsflash : it 's not , and contrary to the spanish part , there is no strong independence movement and people are happy to be french . 
  there is a reason why 99 % of the eta bombings happened in spain . 
  you realize you 're saying the french government is completely intolerant but at [ the same time is funding ** public ** bilingual schools ] ( http://www.ikasbi.com/guide-de-lenseignement-bilingue-en-pays-basque/ ) , offering degrees [ in regional languages like occitan is ** public ** university ] ( http://www.univ-montp3.fr/occitan/ ) , offering news in local languages in ** public ** media , translates every name on the signs in the street , etc. ... 
  the european charter for regional languages is a useless piece of paper , france actually signed it , but it 's not ratified because the constitution would have to be changed and no one wants to go through that . 
  offering the administration in regional language would have made sense a century ago , when there were still native speakers of regional languages , now it does n't make any sense and would cost billions so a mere 0,01 % could do something they can already do in french . 
  because the independent is a terrible newspaper with terrible journalists who ca n't even take 2 seconds to do a google search . 
  [ that also exists in catalan by the way but shhhhh . 
   so you ca n't expect bi-language schools and whatnot ; you 'll only have classes about the language , stuff done to promote the culture , etc. 
  of course he can expect it , [ we have bilingual public schools in the basque country for example . 
  ] ( http://www.ikasbi.com/guide-de-lenseignement-bilingue-en-pays-basque/ ) but that does n't fit the narrative man , we oppress minorities , and people speaking a local language are sent to re-edecution camps as we all know . 
  ah , another one who think this is the 19th century and we 're bigots against other languages . 
  nevermind the public media in local languages , the courses in public universities , the billingual schools for kids ... people like you and others in this thread will still be convinced people are being beaten up because they speak basque or corsican . 
  whatever , we french lack civilization whatever it means . 
   i just know there was plenty of outrage about it in the uk . 
  because the uk has a very strong and active army . 
  i think some people see an eu army as something that would only reduce their power , with no clear benefits . 
  and i think there is some truth in it , smaller central-european countries have only benefits to gain from an eu army , whereas for france or the uk , it 's pretty unclear ( apart from a cut in defence costs ) . 
  i do n't know , there is not much support for it in france either , and with the uk leaving , i do n't see it happening . 
  as the article says , france and the uk have increased military co-operation but nothing happened with the rest of europe , i only see leaders of czech republic , hungary and a few others who keep asking for it but without france nothing will happen . 
   people like to blame the british for the lack of an eu army i 've never heard that . 
   france like to point fingers at third-world countries for repressing minorities ( kurds , armenians , palestine ) and do the same in their backyard that 's a ridiculous comparison . 
  that 's complete rubbish , it 's been the case for years ( since the eiffel tower started to be be illuminated at night in 2000 ) and it 's not enforced for obvious reasons . 
  i agree with you that this association has a the mentality of someone from the 60s , but the article misses a few things . 
  for example , it says :  nathalie kosciusko-morizet , who leads the opposition lr group at city hall , declared it was considering legal moves to stop the pedestrianisation project . 
  while this is true , it 's very incomplete . 
  she clearly said she supports the pedestrianisation but in 2020 , when people using the highway will have no excuse as you said because of the new transport options . 
  right now , - the article also fails to mention that - even the greens and hidalgo recognize it 's gon na increase the pollution . 
  as much as i dislike nkm , i do n't think this totally unreasonable to wait 3 years and a half to implement it . 
   but the french believe that because these people want to enter the uk its a british problem . 
  huh , no . 
  i do n't kow what you mean by `` the french '' but it 's definitely not the french state or current government who continue to block them from crossing ( or at least try to ) . 
  do n't take the opinion of a few people on reddit or a politician desperate to make a comeback like sarkozy as the opinion of people . 
  most people want the state to do its job , which it failed to do . 
  but when the discussion comes up , people are angry at the state , not at the brits who did n't ask them to come . 
   you must be pretty naive , if you think our current politicians are only doing what 's in the peoples best interest . 
  i 've never said anything of the sort , or defended merkel or any politician . 
  i just said that your solution , that is completely impractical , is bullshit . 
  it would cost billions to ship/fly thousands or hundreds of thousands people to countries thousands of kilometers away , not even to talk that you want to do that in countries thousands of kilometers from the mediterranean . 
  i mean , you consider that sending syrians or afghans to a camp in mauritania or senegal is a viable option ... why not the philippines by the way ? 
  stop drinking man . 
  you 're a genius , i ca n't believe the eu has n't called you yet . 
  who knew that the solution was so simple ? 
  how do you put them in senegal ? 
  and your comparison with nauru is ridiculous , [ australia had 20.000 illegal arrivals by sea at the peak of 2013 ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/rp/rp1415/asylumfacts#_toc413067450 ) , a ridiculous number compared to what the eu is facing and it 's a country almost twice the size of the eu with half the population of spain .
