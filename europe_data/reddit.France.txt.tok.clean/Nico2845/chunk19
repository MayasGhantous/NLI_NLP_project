  cry me a river . 
  just a guess , but i think it might have more to do with politics and a will to choose a neighbour or an eu-made rifle . 
  good job europe !, 
  it 's interesting , but she 's missing the point a bit . 
  she tries to explain how marianne was not what it is today , that women could n't vote or that some preferred a version where she had her breast covered . 
  while i 'm sure this is true , today marianne is one of the most iconic representation of the r\u00e9publique , a free beautiful badass independent woman who certainly would n't cover her hair to be `` modest '' because of god . 
  as much as i dislike valls , and as much as i find ridiculous all this debate about the burkini , he 's completely right when he says marianne represents france better than a veiled woman . 
  now i also think that was completely unnecessary to scream it on a stand . 
  yes , dumbass , because france is doing pretty much the same although on a smaller scall . 
  but since i did n't use my criteria for the us , and only stated what an international ngo said , something you are n't apparently able to process with your damaged brain ( no other plausible explanation why you insist on this ) , i do n't know why the fuck do you care what i think about it . 
  but we know that for instance , the us is pushing for lower environmental protection , lower food standards , etc. . negociation documents have been leaked and are easily accessible . 
  so we do n't know what is going to be the final agreement , that 's correct , but at best we 'll keep our standards or we 'll have to adopt the us ' . 
  and the fact that they keep these negociations almost completely opaque , with extremely little access or completely none for some chapters for democratically elected members of the eu parliament , but full access for many big corporations , is to me a big middle finger to all europeans . 
  add to that that the most optimistic economic forecast considers ttip will bring at best $ 120 billion ( or 0.5 % of gdp ) to the eu , in other words a drop in the ocean divided by 28 countries , i 'm very much opposed to ttip without knowing what the final agreement will look like because in the best scenario , it wo n't change much and it wo n't make a difference for europeans as a whole . 
  thanks mate , your counterarguments deserve gold . 
  he 's not a parasite , he actually pays way more taxes proportionally that the multi-billions company that employs him . 
  he 's getting screwed as well , he just does n't realize it . 
  that 's an incredibly stupid reasoning , if there is a bill proposing to introduce slavery for redditors with a username starting by euan , would you wait for it to pass before opposing it ? 
   the claim was that the agreement never had public support . 
  that 's demonstrably false . 
  you did n't demonstrate anything because these polls are pretty much meaningless . 
  [ look , this other pew research , done 7 months before the one you linked above , claims germans support ttip . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/04/09/support-in-principle-for-u-s-eu-trade-pact/ ) ** but ** , and that 's a big ** but ** , when you look at the details , germans are against : - making american and european standards for products and services similar - removing all duties on good imported from germany/us - removing all investment restrictions between us and eu so what does it mean ? 
  simple , when germans are asked if they 're in favour of ttip in 2014 , they just say : `` free trade agreement with the us ? 
  yeah i 'm down with that . '', 
  but basically , when asked about what makes the core of said agreement , they overwhelmingly say : `` fuck no . '', 
  a majority of people always opposed ttip , they just did n't know what it was . 
  as soon as they understood what was inside the deal and what was negociated , they opposed it . 
  well , this poll does n't mean much . 
  first , these are the % of people who are in favour of a free trade agreement with the us . 
  that 's very general , and does n't mean these people support ttip specifically . 
  i 'm actually part of these people , i 'm not necessarly again a free trade agreement with the us , but i 'm against ttip . 
  and second , this data is from november 2014 , a lot of things have changed since then . 
  for example , here in france the socialists ( in power now ) were pushing for ttip in 2014 . 
  but in july 2015 , they voted against an eu resolution to continue negociations because they opposed the international arbitration system . 
  this `` proud '' tradition is not only american . 
  here in france polish or italian immigrants were seen as `` invaders '' , and sometimes it even turned violent [ with poor workers getting lynched .

  to shoot a guy in the back ? 
  as dumb as these people in the video are , i 'm glad i live in a country where at the end of the story , no one got hurt and the assholes have been arrested . 
  no need for dead bodies all around , thank you very much . 
  no , it was during the labour reform bill and a lot of people where there just to fight cops and break stuff . 
  the ones in the video who got caught where unemployed rich kids , it was quite pathetic . 
  [ video . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/wtgf0zyrajs?t=3m25s ), 
  it 's not my criteria dumbass , it 's reporters without borders ' . 
  and it 's the other guy who claimed * `` the freedom of speech and the fair use doctrine are american concepts '' * , i was responding to him about this specifically , ** he ** brought up the us in a thread about france , but you 're too retarded to realize that apparently . 
   it is horrible to compare which terrorists are worse , but as far as i know , no muslim terrorist in the eu specifically targeted children during their attacks ( please correct me if i am wrong ) . 
  mohammed merah specifically targeted a jewish school in toulouse , killing 3 children in 2012 . 
  so you 're wrong . 
  literally 100 % of the us government shutdowns happened because of disagreements . 
  [ you can see by yourself . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_shutdown_in_the_united_states#list_of_u.s._government_funding_gaps ), 
  i agree with your part about the un security council being a joke , but the rest about the eu does n't make any sense at all . 
  you compare the eu , a union of sovereign countries , with china , an authoritarian regime with one political party whose leader is the head of state without the population having a say at all in his election and then you talk about a popular vote system for a european security council ? 
  that 's completely incoherent . 
  i assume you 're from the us , so i 'm pretty sure you know what a shutdown because one party disagrees is ? 
  the last one costed 2b $ to the us , and you 're not part of any union , you 're a sovereign independant country . 
  having everyone to agree on something like defence policy is essential , just like it is for funding . 
   well , atletico support seems excellent so it would be quite strange . 
  oh no you misunderstood me , it 's a statement he made before the 1/4 finals against juventus when he was still playing for monaco !, 
   also , did n't the monaco owner stop ploughing as much money in ? 
  they 're actually back to `` let 's sell players for a shitload of money '' ( martial ? ), 
  kind of thing , ligue 1 does n't really have much choice . 
  liga , bundesliga , pl , serie a are so far above us that we can only produce talent , but except for psg we can not keep these players . 
  little of a future ?!, 
  wow , that 's harsh . 
  did n't know 3 of the largest economies on the planet were just going down the toilet . 
  also , if i may , austria , switzerland and germany are exactly stagnant economies with a less than 1 % growth and faster-than-ever aging populations . 
  but what do i know , i have little of a future coming from paris . 
  actually it can even be a problem to attract some players . 
  yannick ferreira carrasco who plays for atl\u00e9tico now said that `` some players are not made to play in monaco because they need supporters to galvanize them . '', 
  mmh , ok thanks , makes sense . 
  yeah that 's precisely because it 's the champions league and a big club like arsenal . 
  the stadium has only 18,480 sits and the average attendance is less than 8,000 . 
  [ so it usually looks like this . 
  ] ( http://www.lagazettedemonaco.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/footsite499bis.jpg ), 
   alpine countries ( slovenia , austria , switzerland , germany ) not france or italy ? 
  there is already a relocation program . 
  we ca n't reach our quota here in france because we ca n't find enough of them who are willing to come . 
  the real thing to do is what denmark does in refugee camps in lebanon , which is starting massive campaigns debunking the myth europe is a paradise and that refugees will get a big house and a big check every month when they reach germany or sweden . 
  because they 're literally millions of them and the vast majority wants to go to sweden or germany . 
  so this is not necessarly wrong from them to aim for the richest and most generous countries , but this is not possible to send them all there . 
   naomi larrson tells guardian readers that part of the budget still goes to some of the fastest emerging markets in the world such as india , russia and brazil , while india 's economy is expected to exceed the uk 's as soon as 2019 . 
  does anyone has a rational explanation why we 're giving money to brazil or india ? 
  and how much it actually is ? 
  i would say horrifying . 
  [ whataboutism again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism )  when criticisms were leveled at the soviet union , the response would be `` what about ... '' followed by the naming of an event in the western world . 
  it represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to hypocrisy , a logical fallacy which attempts to discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position , without directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
   the country has distinctly more women than men . 
  for every 100 females in estonia , there are 84 men -- only the northern mariana islands , a us territory in the pacific , with a population of around 50,000 , has a smaller percentage of males . 
  * checking tickets for tallinn, 
   greenwald lives in brazil because his partner is from there . 
  he travels freely to the us . 
  fair enough , but that does n't change the fact it 's harder than ever for a journalist to do his job in the us and [ how large-scale us surveillance is harming journalism , law , and american democracy ] ( https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/07/28/liberty-monitor-all/how-large-scale-us-surveillance-harming-journalism-law-and )  greenwald asserted that `` it is the uk through their interception of underwater fibre optic cables , that is a primary threat to the privacy of european citizens when it comes to their telephone and emails '' . 
  unrelated to our discussion , what does the uk have to do with this ? 
  whataboutism at its finest . 
   surveillance has nothing to do with freedom of speech . 
  when the us government through its various intelligence agencies is monitoring everything a journalist writes , listens and speaks about , and actively tries to stop him from investigating and revealing informations , to an extent that this journalist has to go live abroad to be able to work like glenn greenwald in brazil , of course it does . 
  are you kidding me ?
