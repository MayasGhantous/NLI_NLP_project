  and we need gaz , we do n't have the choice and have to work with the russians . 
   all the people who have ever lived there have been british . 
  well it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  it 's a british who discovered it , but the first permanent settlers were from saint-malo in france which is why the falklands are called `` malouines '' in french and `` malvinas '' in spanish . 
  then the islands were claimed by the british and spanish , and it 's only in the 19th century that britain really started to progressively send british settlers there . 
  no doubt they belong to the uk and its citizens are totally british ( as they massively already expressed it themselves ) , it 's just not really accurate to say the inhabitants have always been british . 
  it seems a bit similar to what we experienced in france , we won the world cup in 1998 , then the euro in 2000 , everybody thought we were going to be world champs again ... then we failed miserably in 2002 . 
  it 'll be interesting to see if you can get back up , you still have formidable players . 
  or you know , spain winning the euro , the world cup , then the euro again . 
   i 'd trust that more than a british politician . 
  you 'd trust more a random website than the bbc and the foreign office . 
  that 's great . 
  you 're the top mate , you 're great . 
  cheers . 
  that 's where we disagree . 
   the point everyone else is making is that the eu will not be unscathed . 
  that 's literally what i said :  the eu will definitely lose some influence , that 's undeniable, 
   i do n't even need to present a detailed argument lol because you have none to oppose mine  but i understand , it 's hard to swallow that your own diplomats and state-owned media valid my point , 
   i am an outside source  some random opinion piece yeah , the bbc and the uk 's foreign office are totally random sources , sure . 
  some american redditor like you has definitely more knowledge than them , sounds legit !, 
   i 'm just giving you an american perspective though yup , i noticed . 
  [ again , that 's not me who says it but the uk . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-20218377 ) but please , enlight me mate , i 'm sure you can find a better source than the uk 's foreign office and the bbc on this !, 
  that 's true that the eu will drop to the second biggest economic union in the world . 
  my point was more to say the eu will be huge in comparison to the uk . 
   the uk is your second largest economy , largest military spender and has by far the most dipolomatic and cultural influence on a global scale . 
  without them the eu loses it 's close ties with many english speaking countries around the world . 
  except for the point about the british economy being huge within the eu , i think you really overestimate british influence . 
  first of all , nothing would really change for military strategy , the uk and france do most of the job and the objectives will remain the same . 
  what the uk and france do is already independent from the eu . 
  what massive cultural influence the uk has today ? 
  the us has one for sure , but the uk ? 
  it 's not the 19th century anymore . 
  and the uk has ** less ** diplomatic influence than france , by far . 
  do you know who says it ? 
  [ the uk itself . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-20218377 ) you note that this is a bbc article , not some bullshit biased french source . 
  and if you really think the eu relies on the uk to trade and exchange with countries like india or australia you 're completely delusionnal . 
  good point , but the eu would still be huge and the uk will be tiny in comparison . 
  i know that , again the long term consequence for russia would be enormous if they invade a nato member , that does n't make any sense for them . 
   is the eu will loose even more influence in the world in the event of ~ ~ england ~ ~ ** the uk ** leaving . 
  ftfy . 
  the eu will definitely lose some influence , that 's undeniable , but it 's not comparable to what the uk would if brexit happens . 
  the eu will remain the biggest economic union in the world , the uk will stand alone next to it . 
  they could n't achieve that with the ussr that was 100 times more powerful that russia is today , what makes you think they could make it happen now ? 
  really ? 
  funny you think that way , from my perspective it 's the british influence in the world that would be severly diminished ... 
  it will be 10000x more costly for russia . 
  no matter how powerful they are , it 's just simply not worth it for them . 
   there will be voices saying that they do n't want a nuclear war to be started for some irrelevant baltic shithole . 
  of course there will be , that does n't mean suddenly all nato members are going to say `` article 5 does n't count anymore , sorry and good luck ! '' . 
  that would mark the collapse of nato and no one wants that . 
  except extremely hypothetical opinions , nothing justifies spending more billions to prevent an invasion that would basically bankrupt russia . 
   celts did n't speak latin , nor did gauls , nor did turks . 
  they did n't wear roman clothes , they did n't build roman buildings , they did n't feel roman . 
  they sure as hell adopted it , this is why french is basically a dialect of latin like spanish . 
  of course to talk about common identity at the time is complicated , because it evolved a lot and our perception of it is very different today . 
  but romans definitely brought a common culture , and [ this is why today our parliament looks like this ] ( http://www.francois-lamy.fr/wp-content/themes/lamy2014/images/assemblee_nationale.png ) and we have a strong wine culture for example . 
   but you ca n't expect countries like estonia , latvia or lithuania to deter russia on their own no ... 
  this is why they 're part of nato , that guarentees they will get full support in case of agression , which is not happening because they 're part of nato . 
  again , if russia invades estonia for example , they would get completely destroyed afterwards . 
  it 's simply not worth it for them , hence they focus on countries like ukraine and georgia that are not part of nato . 
  i never said all our troops are deployed , just a lot are because of the current situation . 
  we would contribute if needed , and it 's also why nato exists , it does n't rely on only one country but many . 
  because ee does n't rely on the us to be protected , it relies on nato in which the us plays by far the biggest role and is the biggest contributor , it 's different . 
  russia wo n't intervene in countries that are part of nato not because they would n't be capable of successfully invade them , but because they would get completely destroy afterwards . 
   there was no roman identity - no shared culture or language or any of that . 
  seriously ? 
  have n't you notice how similar some buildings are throughout europe ? 
  and latin words that we find in basically every language ? 
  that was the huge strength of the roman empire , they brought civilisation to every therritory they conquered with roads , buildings , language and so on , giving them precisely something in common . 
   they ( the eu easter border people ) feel that way . 
  as fellow eu brethren , we need to respect their feelings . 
  i do n't give a shit about their feelings . 
  i 'll talk only about my country and the current situation we 're in . 
  so , in the past few years , we intervened in mali , in centrafrica and syria . 
  troops are still deployed and active in the three regions . 
  we experienced the worst terrorist attacks since wwii last year and our military is permanently deployed everywhere on the territory because of the state of emergency to prevent the next terrorist attack that ** will ** come . 
  and you 're telling me eastern european countries , that are part of nato and therefore guarenteed by law that we would intervene in case of agression , want our troops to be deployed because they `` feel '' threatened ? 
  do you realize how ludicrous this is to request something like that in the current situation ? 
   the rafale is a great aircraft , but its a multi-role fighter , not a strategic bomber . 
  the rafale is the textbook definition of a multi-role fighter that has literally no equivalent . 
  and yes , russians are extremely powerful but i do n't see how libya is relevant ? 
  i gave you a version of a long range bomber that is relevant in 2016 , do what you want with it . 
  edit : sorry , i misread you , you were talking about a strategic bomber, 
  like the rafale that are on the charles de gaulle nuclear aircraft carrier that russia does n't have and [ china is struggling to get ? 
  ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2016/01/chinas-aircraft-carrier-ambitions/ ) or this little european boy [ the us army is considering to buy ? 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/airbus-a400m-set-for-july-deliveries-2013-6?op=1&amp;ir=t ), 
  what capability the russian army has that the brits or the french do n't ? 
  last time i checked it was russia that was buying warships and the technology that comes with it to france , but please enlight me . 
   but they do n't and neither does the rest of europe what ? 
  the military of the eu members combined dwarfs the russian 's . 
  hell , even the british or french army alone are on par with the russian army . 
  i totally agree that they should have taken action a lot earlier , i was only talking about what is happening now . 
  do n't know about the netherlands but here we do have mass searches and raids every week , the state of emergency is still in place . 
  all the places where known terrorists were like molenbeek have been raided and all the terrorists involved are either dead or in custody . 
  and i have no idea how you plan to begin mass deportation of people who were for a very large majority born here . 
  i 'm not saying there are no massive failures , but to say that nothing is being done is complete crap . 
   take advantage of these men 's heroism by pretending nothing is actually wrong . 
  how can someone proclaims such bullshit is beyond me .
