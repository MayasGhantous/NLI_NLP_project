   it 's not only the french . 
  the spanish , the germans , the british , the russians , are all trying to limit the ** freedoms ** that came with the internet . 
  ** the freedom of speech ** and the fair use doctrine are american concepts , they do n't necessarily match the european fundamental laws . 
  ** you ** started to brag about how freedom of speech is an american concept . 
  me and other people replied to you on this and we 're discussing this . 
   it 's unconstitutional to monitor american citizens without probable cause and a judge order lol , even after snowden revelations and all the nsa scandal , it 's amazing to still find people as naive as you . 
  from my link :  ** however ** , in 2014 , the united states was added to reporters without borders ( rwb ) 's list of `` enemies of the internet '' , a group of countries with the highest level of internet censorship and surveillance . 
  rwb stated that ** the us '' ... has undermined confidence in the internet and its own standards of security '' ** and that ** `` u.s. surveillance practices and decryption activities are a direct threat to investigative journalists , especially those who work with sensitive sources for whom confidentiality is paramount and who are already under pressure . 
  '' ** read the whole thing , it wo n't make you sick contrary to a common held opinion . 
  if you bothered to be consistent , which you should be , you would realize that you claimed that * `` freedom of speech and the fair use doctrine are american concepts '' * , and my reply with a link towards a map of countries with their different level of censorship and surveillance was absolutely coherent . 
  lol , for your information , the us is in reporters without borders ' list of `` enemies of the internet '' , and is considered to be in [ the same group than russia or china for surveillance and censorship on the internet . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country#/media/file:internet_censorship_and_surveillance_world_map.svg ) but sure , `` muh freedom !! '', 
  i did n't pay attention to the website i just looked at the data in the charts !, 
   i really hope that down the line we will eventually get an eu wide corporate tax rate so as to stop this race to the bottom . 
  and it should have been done before adopting a common currency . 
  oh shit no i did n't pay enough attention to your flair i thought you were polish !, 
  ok the whole thing makes sense now ... 
  til then , my bad , it 's a shame we do n't hear about it here in france . 
   we have commited a sizable force to mali [ you sent 20 training officers in mali ] ( http://pkwmali.wp.mil.pl/en/17.html ) . 
  you did n't have to , and it 's much appreciated , but please do n't pretend this is a sizable force . 
  i could n't find anything about polish troops in sudan in english or french , but if you have any infos i 'd like to know more about it ( no sarcasm ) . 
  the subject of the article is an official threatening to sue people sharing the pictures of the police executing the law . 
  oh so you 're talking about burkini in general , not the subject of this article then . 
   state is weak one mayor . 
  the state has nothing to do with it . 
  and as much as i disagree with all this bullshit , to sue someone is the most democratic action you can take . 
  it 's literally the opposite of what an authoritarian state would do . 
  of course , because covering skin did n't exist before the invention of burkini in 2006 , it truly changed the world and taught us wearing clothes protects humans from the sun . 
  islam saved us all !, 
  maybe the legal age to go to a bar ? 
  i 'm confused now . 
  forget about waterloo , it 's about britain getting more medals than us , we 're really mad about it . 
  ca n't figure out the allah ahkbar either though , what a weird thing to say . 
  it 's soaring , from 12 to 60 . 
   `` i can tell you that online on sunday , we received 60 orders -- ** all of them non-muslim '' ** useful idiots thinking they 're fighting fascism . 
  is there any international sports federation that is not rotten to the core ? 
   we won medals in a wider range of sports than any other country . 
  you won medals in the 20 sports who got selected to get funding , which is what the article explained , whereas in france , the budget is divided between 90 sports . 
  20 sports is already a very wide range in my opinion , and as the final medal count showed , it paid off for gb . 
  now to be honest i prefer the french way , simply because it 's a little bit closer to the original idea of the olympics , which is having amateurs competing and the real important thing is participating . 
  but in no way i would blame gb and their strategy or be salty about it , all these british athletes deserved their medals . 
  one thing the bbc article points out that is very true is how some high officials ( in france ) in federations get ridiculous salaries while athletes who could potentially win a medal struggle . 
  this is really shameful and should be changed . 
   ukraine got rid of their nukes for safety - look how well that worked out for them . 
  lol , that 's a good one . 
  first , ukraine `` inherited '' nukes when they got their independence from russia , but that does n't mean they could do anything with them . 
  they had huge guns with no bullet and not even magazines . 
   [ while ukraine had physical control of the weapons , it did not have operational control , as they were dependent on russian-controlled electronic permissive action links and the russian command and control system . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_ukraine ) i mean , you seriously tried to argue that ukraine was a nuclear power at some point ? 
  really ? ... 
  second , the example of ukraine and georgia keep being used by poles and other people who are outright paranoid about russia . 
  so i 'll repeat it again : ukraine and georgia are not nato members , and they 're not eu members . 
  they 're alone . 
  also , if the soviets did n't touch with a stick a nato member when they were at the top of their game a few decades ago , please explain to me why russia , currently with a gdp smaller than italy 's and shrinking , would attack the strongest military alliance on the planet ? 
  please present your arguments . 
  glorious finnish sport !, 
   islam being a new `` threat '' in europe , it will be interesting to see how things evolve . 
  badly . 
  it 's evolving very , very badly . 
  like the freedom to have a beer on a public bench on a sunny afternoon when you 're 20 years old ? 
  oh no , the land of the free ^ ^ ^ tm will throw you in jail for that . 
  til , not exactly yesterday though !, 
  well it would be more like trump gets elected , does a terrible job and ends up the most hated president in history , then loses against hillary , then tries to run against her again . 
   well , that 's not an unlikely scenario i do n't think it ever happened that a candidate lost and then got again the nomination at the next elections in the us . 
  well , if you look at alpine skying , you can get 5 medals . 
  [ in speed skating , including short track , you can get 9 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_olympic_games#current_sport_disciplines ) ski jumping and slalom for example are so different that it ca n't be really put in the same category . 
  we have contenders in slalom but no serious one in ski jumping because it 's not the same sports culture . 
  i understand , but i get why danes do n't really get involved in it . 
  also , great britain is a big country so it 's understandable why they get 1 or 2 medals , and the last time belgium got a medal it was in 1998 , like denmark , and it was a bronze whereas danes got a silver ... 
  the netherlands really is an exception in this . 
  most republicans want jupp\u00e9 , and the situation is different than trump/sanders/clinton because sarkozy already lost , and not against anybody but someone who was already not popular . 
   also , sarkozy is strong during the election because , a bit like trump , he cover quite well the media even if he what he say is stupid/impossible . 
  he was strong one time , in 2007 , and when he adopted the same strategy in 2012 he lost miserably against hollande , that everybody considered already like a pathetic loser . 
  i think this alone is very telling . 
  my point was not to blame the netherlands for not having athletes in other sports , my point was to say there is only one winter olympics ' sport that is a dutch tradition and it 's ice skating . 
  you did n't start caring about ice skating to participate in the winter olympics , it goes back way before . 
  denmark is n't good or does n't have any tradition in any winter olympics sports , therefore they do n't have medals or it 's very rare . 
  dutch happen to be excellent at ice skating , which is also the sport that gives the most medals . 
  so yeah , it 's in the top of the medal count at the end , but only because the netherlands dominates in one sport . 
  you do n't compete in the winter olympics , you compete in ice-skating in the winter olympics . 
  100 % of your medals come from there and you are nowhere to be seen in any other sports . 
  i do n't think spanish will replace english ( i 'm not op ) , but spanish will become more and more important . 
  [ the us is expected to be the largest spanish-speaking country in the world by 2050 . 
  ] ( http://qz.com/441174/by-2050-united-states-will-have-more-spanish-speakers-than-any-other-country/ ), 
  yeah in the final medal count , we 're the only country of the top 8 to have more silver than gold . 
  very frustrating . 
  yeah , but it wo n't ever be a big problem because developped countries eradicate it quite easily . 
  you 're from the us , ever wondered why you have almost no malaria in florida ? 
  because you eradicated mosquitos carrying malaria , a healthcare system , easy access to mosquito nets or mosquito repellent , medicine , etc. . . 
  if you look at the countries where it 's a major problem , it 's often poor countries or extremely poor countries . 
  i traveled quite a lot in south east asia , and the most affected regions are always the poorest where most people ca n't even afford repellent . 
  and what about ethiopia ? 
  or mongolia ? 
  british would be smashed if those countries had a velodrome !, 
  but it 's a gold medal mate , gold is worth a lot . 
  well , it opened in 2013 and it 's already closing , so relatively speaking , it was not an important museum at all . 
  still , it 's always sad to see that they have to shut it down . 
  not to downplay the rest of your team 's performance , but i do n't think it 's possible to beat denmark when hansen plays at this level . 
  nothing new , but what an amazing player you have .
