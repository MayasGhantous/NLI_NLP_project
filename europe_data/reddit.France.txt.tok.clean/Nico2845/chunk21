  we 've had a new show in france for the past 2 years called [ `` le bureau des l\u00e9gendes '' . 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4063800/ ) it 's one of my favourite , it 's about espionnage but in a very realistic way , you wo n't see explosions and action very often . 
  it 's a great show to see how an intelligence service works ( other than the usual cia , nsa , etc. . . ) . 
  no , because the article i linked is . 
  [ just read this article , it 's spot on and pretty much sums up what i think of it . 
  ] ( http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/vu-dalgerie-burka-et-burkini-une-provocation-inutile-en-france ) for the record this is an algerian newspaper . 
   the cannes mayor banned it because it was n't indicative of `` good morals ' . 
  [ bonne m\u0153urs and ordre public are tied together . 
  ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonnes_m%c5%93urs ), 
   if it 's about more than one religion then it 's not a `` religious '' thing , but rather a cultural . 
  what ? 
   i was n't the one that banned burkas because of secularism . 
  burkas are not banned , face covering is . 
  [ egypt is also in the process of banning it by the way , ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/egypt-drafts-bill-to-ban-niqab-veil-in-public-places-a6920701.html ) i guess they 're horrible people oppressing muslims as well . 
   so , if one of the judges based on the law made such decision , then we can expect all other judges to make the same judgement . 
  so , again , this becomes a national issue . 
  not necessarly , we do n't have the common law and judges do n't necessarly have to follow previous decisions . 
  also , once again , only a very few towns have banned it . 
   the first burkini ban was in cannes and the mayor defending it on the basis of `` good morals '' not `` public order '' . 
   if people playing pokemon go got into a violent fight then you think the city should ban pokemon go ? 
  [ it is banned in a village because of the car accidents it could cause , ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/internet/pokemon-go/pokemon-go-interdit-dans-un-village-de-l-ain_1593461.html ) and also in some public places in lyon , so yeah , when something can cause problems it can be banned . 
   if the argument is that its to protect secularity then it is obviously implied it 's about religion , lol . 
  you said about ** one ** religion , implying someone said women covering was exclusively muslim , and giving the example of a christian woman with her head covered . 
  you 're incredibly dishonest , are n't you ? 
   perhaps they are the biggest minority but also the most conservative . 
  so perhaps they should be less conservative and follow the rules like everybody else ? 
   is prime minister valls also irrelevant by basically sanctioning this type of bans for all france ? 
  yes , because he does n't take any decision . 
  judges do . 
   any stories about that , first time i hear about it ? 
  and even if how does one connect to other ? 
   two of the things you mentioned are part of the standard yes . 
  that you fail to fulfill . 
  how do we fail ? 
   i do recognize their affilitation to islam . 
  they are muslim the same way i am christian . 
  on paper . 
  christians-on-paper do n't kill anyone in the name of the god here , or any other religious people other than muslims . 
  so it 's irrelevant . 
   no , i did not ignore , i have explained why i think this part of the definition is irrelevant . 
  oh so you 're just ignoring what does n't confirm what you think then ? 
  good , good ...  you really have no sense of sarcasm , do you ? 
  i did n't read you properly , edited . 
   support for the presence of , several distinct cultural or ethnic groups within a society you chose to ignore the word ** `` or '' ** before but nice try . 
   ** or ** support for the presence of , several distinct cultural or ethnic groups within a society ~ ~ also , taking north korea as an example is terrible , since a big part of the regime 's policy is racial purity , with women having kids with chinese being force to abort . ~ ~, 
   it was an example it 's not a practice tied to one religion . 
  no one said it was , or you just make things up in your head . 
   well , except burkini a public servant also can not cover hair on the job . 
  like jewish women or sikhs . 
  the same rule applies for everybody , only muslims have a problem with it . 
   so far . 
  but since prime minister valls said it 's totally ok i expect more of those . 
  your expectations are completely irrelevant in this discussion . 
   you have now also sizable muslim minority , so i 'm sorry you have to deal with it and not pretend burkini ban is about secularity . 
  also , no one is calling for church destruction . 
  banning burkinis have been validated by a court for public order reasons . 
  because of men with women in burkinis threw rocks at people and tried to privatize a public beach . 
  other mayors did n't want to have this kind of problem . 
  also , no one is calling for mosques destruction . 
   wow , a truly progressive country !, 
  that 's such an improvement over saudi arabia !, 
  too bad it 's also considered a standard almost everywhere else and i 'm baffled you even brought it up . 
  so we 're standard in our treatment of muslims ? 
  i 'm glad you recognize it . 
   yeah , if you would have an ounce of reason you 'd know that terrorists are usually the least religious once . 
  if you had an ounce of honesty you 'd recognize 100 % of the terrorists in the past years in france are muslims . 
   multiculturalism implies embracing different cultures no , the fact that there are different cultures within a society makes it multicultural , period . 
  oxford dictionnary :  ** the presence of ** , or support for the presence of , several distinct cultural or ethnic groups within a society, 
   because this would imply equal treatment of other cultures that 's not what multiculturalism is . 
  france has always been multicultural ( like every single european country ) , with different regional indentities with their own culture and language , the fact the french government tried to impose a common french identity does n't change that . 
  or are you going to tell me india is not a multicultural country , because other cultures are not treated as equal as hindous ? 
   dude , that 's polish prime minister , not a nun . 
  every christian woman , even a head of state , is obligated to cover their hai , because it 's considered a sign of modesty . 
  sounds familiar ? 
  hmm ... no it does n't . 
  you 're mixing everything here . 
  first , what a polish pm visiting the pope in a foreign country ( the vatican ) has to do with anything happening in france ? 
  how are muslims women ban from covering their hair in france ? 
  burkinis are banned on a few beaches in the whole country , that 's it . 
   oh yeah , for sure . 
  all those places named after christian saints , christian celebrations in the streets , bells chiming every sunday ... yup , complete secularity all around . 
  we 've been a christian country for well over a millenium , sorry we did n't destroy every church or replaced all the names and erased all the past . 
   it 's all about france 's dislike of arab culture so they try to hide all of its manifestations . 
  fuck that , they build mosques , are free to practice their religion , produce terrorists , but the rest of us are the problem and we oppress them somehow . 
  unbelievable . 
  just checked the link , it works for me . 
  google that :  despite losing tens of billions of euros , germany is making a profit out of the greek crisis have a nice read !, 
   try to educate yourselfe before writing such utterly stupid things , please . . [ please educate yourself on how germany makes a profit out of the greek crisis . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/08/11/despite-losing-tens-of-billions-of-e-germany-is-making-a-profit-out-of-the-greek-crisis/#60b5fb0f2b4a ), 
  i do n't disagree that germany and france have problems to solve , but it 's not like the netherlands , luxembourg or ireland are remote countries who do their thing on their own . 
  they are all in the eu , like us , we share the same currency and we are all on the same boat . 
  what they do has a huge effect , and it 's one of the many reason why a lot of europeans have problems believing in the eu when you see luxembourg 's economic policy that basically consists in ripping off its neighbours . 
  then we get served great speeches on european solidarity ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  and greece can very much blame germany and france , we 're ripping them off through our ridiculous loans they basically have no choice but to take . 
  it does n't mean all of greece 's problems are other countries ' fault , but as long as we act like vultures on each other , the eu will continue to be a suspicious entity with no real credibility . 
   our economy is also hugely pharmaceutical based your economy is hugely low corporation tax based , please do n't fool yourself . 
  i put concrete with glass and steel in the same post-1950 building-material trend at least in paris , before that good quality stones were used and you can see the difference . 
  and i 'm not only talking about decay but esthetically speaking as well . 
  my problem with this kind of building is that they do n't age well at all .
