  no other community is involved in this . 
  for fuck sake , romas have a terrible life , are often treated worse than dog shit and they 're not violent . 
  we never hear a thing about the hundred of thousands of chinese , or hundred of thousands of vietnamese . 
  if some muslims decide this is the way to go , they have no one to blame but themselves . 
  lol , i must say i 'd never heard anyone call us pimps until that !, 
   i am now going to ignore reality as it does not fit my agenda ... . . did i do good r/europe ? 
  you did very good . 
   we have a nice little medical tourist industry coming in from eastern europe . 
  i think you got it backwards , you mean you have a nice little medical tourist industry for british to go to eastern and central europe ? 
   according to a survey conducted by portal treatment abroad in 2012 on 1,045 europeans shopping for procedures abroad ** ( half of them british ) ** , the top three most popular locations were * hungary , belgium and poland , followed by spain and czech republic * .

  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/luizaoleszczuk/2013/10/22/central-europe-becoming-a-big-destination-for-medical-tourism/#64af470172ee ) britain is not even in the top 5 destinations for medical tourism in europe , but you make half of the medical tourists ... 
  the rude , arrogant attitude was to vote leave then expect to remain the finance capital of the eu . 
  the uk gave a huge middle finger to the eu , what did you expect ? 
  also , what the mayor of paris said was not `` boasting '' , and a lot more respectful than the [ `` venez \u00e0 londres , mes amis '' boris johnson dropped while the french government was negociating with mittal to save thousands of jobs . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9705873/boris-johnson-venez-a-londres-mes-amis-mayor-tells-tells-indian-businessmen.html ) so , fuck off . 
   the best blue cheese i 've ever had ... american . 
  better cheesemaking through science and technology . 
  that 's one of those things were the old way is legit , but someone figured out a new way that 's even more legit . 
  from wikipedia :  roquefort , another type of blue cheese , had been made for hundreds of years in europe , but attempts to manufacture a similar cheese in the united states had thus far been unsuccessful . 
  difficulties encountered in making these types of cheeses produced a less than satisfactory product , and quality control would have been disastrous . 
  so basically , us cheesemakers failed to do what peasants have been making in caves for about a thousand years in auvergne , so they had to resort to scientists . 
  i am not very impressed and i do n't really get the `` legit '' part . 
  i would have said brazil , just because , brazil .

  as someone born and raised in paris , i get angry looks and agressive conversations with people usually . 
  now , it 's amazing . 
  people shake my hand because i 'm wearing france 's jersey , an old american guy told me `` allez les bleus !! '', 
  randomly , honking everywhere , the grocery store next door being ok with a guy buying a beer missing 50 cents ... 
  it 's cool , really cool . 
  it has n't been nice like this for a while . 
  and we still love you germany !!, 
  just glad we finally made it . 
  as a french , i felt like iceland against england . 
  we played well for 5 minutes in the first half , then 3 minutes in the second . 
  schweini really gave us a penalty , i still ca n't believe lloris has been superior to neuer . 
  anyway , nothing to brag about here , we beat a team that was better than us and i 'm happy about it , but no reason for us to become cocky , germany was an amazing opponent as always . 
  ^ if ^ i ^ may ^ fuck ^ bild ^ though, 
  make coman great ( he already is but more ) that would be nice !,

  til , the map should have had included them . 
  because the dutch ones are autonomous territories that are not fully part of the eu , unlike the r\u00e9union , guyane , guadeloupe and martinique . 
  the map does n't have zoom-ins of other french territories like tahiti or nouvelle cal\u00e9donie for the same reason . 
  that 's what gaddafi was doing in libya , blocking refugees for the eu . 
  since he 's gone and the country is now a failed state , well , you see what happens . 
  and there is already a plan to detain refugees in libya , it 's just very complicated and controversial to set it up ( der spiegel had an article based on a eu document they obtained but i ca n't find it , [ only this article in french explains it ] ( http://www.vsd.fr/l-oeil-de-spiegel-online/revelations-emprisonner-les-migrants-en-libye-le-projet-secret-de-l-union-europeenne-13574 ) ) . 
  egypt is a pretty new port of departure , there has been only a 1.000 crossing from there in 2016 . 
   paris is 32nd in ranking for financial centres ... frankfurt is only one in eu now in top 20th . 
  depends in what ranking . 
  [ here paris is the 7th biggest in the world , frankfurt is 8th . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_centre#international_financial_centres_development_index ) i think the fact that in one ranking made by a british think-tank paris is 32nd and is 7th in another one made by two americans and one chinese companies says a lot about how much credibility these rankings have . 
  but if you want to believe that paris is less important in finance than calgary in canada or dalian in china , be my guest . 
  indeed . 
  to be fair no one really gives a shit in france , here people talk about germany being far ahead of us , not the uk . 
   arnold schwarzenegger as governor ( govinator ) of california had more real power than most of europe 's presidents and prime ministers . . is n't that nuts ? 
  no he had not . 
  he 's not the head of a sovereign state , has zero military power , has zero authority to negociate trade deals with other countries , has zero representatives in international organizations , etc , etc. . . 
  i really do n't get these comparisons between states/regions and countries , they do n't make sense at all . 
  yet we beat you in every measure of poverty or social exclusion . 
  the uk has : - [ higher poverty rate ] ( http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=en ) - [ higher rate of people living in households with very low work intensity ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:people_living_in_households_with_very_low_work_intensity,_by_country,_2008_and_2014.jpg ) - [ higher rate of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion,_by_country,_2008_and_2014.jpg ) i could give dozens of examples from any european or international institutions . 
  enjoy your low employment rates , and do n't forget to give a pound while it 's still worth something to the homeless employed guy at the corner of your street , he needs coffee while waiting for a call from mcdonald 's who generously gave him a 0 hour contract !, 
   basically mainland europeans mix a lot more on a daily basis and have had borders shift around through history while the british population has evolved in a separate way . 
  which is completely ludicrous . 
  britain as a nation speaks english which is a mix between latin , germanic and french languages . 
  all mainland european languages . 
  their have been invaded and under the control of romans ( with the exception of scotland ) , then there were the vikings raids who establish there , then normans invaded and took control , ruling the country for centuries . 
  still today the queen 's family is of german descent , again , all europeans from the mainland . 
  english also controlled large territories on mainland europe for centuries , notably in france . 
  they have constantly been involved in wars with other mainland european nations , mostly france . 
  when i hear the argument : `` we just want to be alone , we 're an island and we 're different , we do n't want to have anything to do with mainland europe and never had !, 
  '' , it 's just plain ignorance . 
  i know a lot of people have been amazed by this chant ( and i understand why if you 've never heard it before ) but it 's really not something special to iceland . 
  [ lyon supporters have been doing it for a while , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwfykcpo5q ) it 's very common in [ greece as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwdtxjsedl4 ) or turkey . 
  it 's not something you see in england , spain or germany , but it 's nothing new in other countries . 
  still a great chant , and as far as i remember , iceland is the only national team doing it .

  now imagine having to take it every morning and every night at rush hour . 
  you understand my point . 
  i wonder of these figures include people with dual citizenship . 
  we have 1,5 million portuguese in france , and many are sons of immigrants who were born here but never actually lived in portugal . 
  salty . 
  lol people voted and overwhelmingly agree with me : you 're full of shit , 
   you are talking about something you have a strong opinion on . 
  you are like an american explaining why they need a machine gun with them at all times or else some gang will murder them or how if they dont have a gun the government will become fascist , like russia , and kill them and they are the last line of defense . 
  you know nothing of the actual subject . 
  lol , that was by far the stupidest analogy i 've read here . 
   so you can calm down now . 
  oh i 'm very relaxed , do n't worry , 
   the issue here is you cant figure it out , ok you can stay off public transit , but dont assume everyone else is like you and is unable to figure it out . 
  figure what out ? 
  you do n't even make sense ...  a class action suite is irrelevant . 
  ah ok , a new lecture about the french justice system now . 
  you 're impressive , is there a topic you 're not an expert on ? 
   my argument is the simple truth .
