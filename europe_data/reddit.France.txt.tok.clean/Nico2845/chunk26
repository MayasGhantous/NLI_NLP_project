  so i gave you a link talking about the 21 mass shooting in texas last year alone , you respond by giving me a list of 12 `` mass shootings stopped by good guys with guns '' ** since 1997 in the whole fucking us . 
  ** and simple pistol ownership is legal in european countries , but you 've got no clue what you 're talking about , have n't you ? 
   there is a reason why things like that are nipped in a bud or barely every happen in places like texas . 
  hahahaha , [ 21 mass shootings in texas in 2015 , 6 children among the victims . 
  ] ( https://www.texasobserver.org/mass-shooting-2015-texas/ ) what a great gun-loving place . 
  when will you pro-guns on reddit understand we do n't fucking want to import american vision of guns here . 
  the american approach towards guns is the model ** not to follow ** for the rest of the developped world , get that in your bloody head . 
  edit : spelling . 
  i tried to defend your integrity my friend !, 
  ^ ( ^ i ' ^ m ^ ^ a ^ ^ hero ), 
  everybody is trying to reform asylum laws , and again it 's easy to control your border when it 's a stupid bridge . 
   i did n't say it was n't the case , furthermore you ca n't be deported in that little time , there is an appeal and potentially a long process.people are never deported that swiftly in france . 
  there is an `` absolute emergency '' procedure to deport people . 
  the decision can be taken within hours . 
  and you need a legitimate reason for an appeal to be accepted . 
  i doubt he had one . 
  second , during the appeal ( 1 month ) where do you think he would have stayed ? 
  in jail . 
  try to browse the internet before making ridiculous assertions please . 
  so this is your eiffel tower then !, 
  ( the eiffel tower was built for the world expo of 1889 and was supposed to be destroyed afterwards . ), 
   i doubt a judge had the time to sentence that guy to a lawful deportation . 
  yeah complete bullshit , a deportation can only be ordered by judge in france . 
  the administration fucked up gloriously by not cancelling his visa but stop pulling stuff out your ass to confirm your narrative . 
  wtf the brits have to do with this ? 
  i said migrants in calais want to go to britain , i never said it was the fault of british . 
  they do n't want them , and we keep them from crossing the border . 
  you just shut down your borders in complete panic for migrants when you realise you could n't control them anymore , we do n't have the luxury to do this . 
  did a waiter spit in your food when you were visiting paris or what ? 
  calais migrants want to go to the uk , nowhere else . 
  so except putting them in concentration camps or they accept to apply for asylum in france , there is not much to do . 
  unless sweden is willing to send its special forces , put a gun in the back of their head and bring hundreds of planes to send them back to wherever they 're from . 
  unfortunately we do n't have the luxury to close our borders that does n't only consist of a bridge . 
   inequality increasing does n't mean that people are getting poorer for the large majority yes it does . 
  what has the calais jungle to do with this ? 
   would you not consider that people becoming wealthier ? 
  poland is an ex-soviet block country that is quickly catching up , in western europe ( germany , the uk , france , italy ) people are getting poorer . 
  not dramatically yet , but wealth inequality is increasing . 
  oh kicking him out of the country should have been enough ... if these morons took 30 seconds to fucking cancel his schengen visa . 
  go tell an iranian he 's an arab and get back to me . 
  [ a `` new '' series premiering in september ** 2015 ** yeah . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ite5v/in_the_spirit_of_the_times_a_new_norwegian_tv/ ), 
  yeah i clicked on it thinking it would be a 2 hours lecture , 25 minutes is very short and he 's done a great job summarizing such a complex issue like this with only a few examples . 
   well , hollande has been weak politically ever since he has been elected . 
  plus he pretty much ran a campaign aimed at putting an end to europe going the `` german way '' . 
  not exactly the best prerequisites for a successful relationship between equals . 
  which is what we should aim for in the end . 
  europe wo n't be happpy under german or french leadership , but if our two countries collaborate to find a solution that is acceptable for everybody , the results will benefit pretty much everyone . 
  the french election next year will certainly be more important than the german one . 
  simply because there likely wo n't be much change over here . 
  it 's easier to blame others than to acknowledge your mistakes . 
  what i kind of find sad is chirac managed to build a strong relationship with germany over the years , and sarkozy and even more hollande destroyed it so quickly . 
  the next one will have to rebuild trust almost from scratch . 
  anyway , as you said , everybody needs to be happy in order to work , so i hope they will figure it out . 
  i think a lot will change when we elect our new president . 
  right now , and for at least the past year , merkel has basically stoppped considering hollande a legit leader . 
  she 's just waiting for the next president to restart the franco-german leadership . 
  so , it 's hard to predict what is going to happen in the next three years . 
  as for the netherlands , i do n't think they benefited that much . 
  their economy is mostly services and their industrial exports are not as important as germany 's ( in % of their economy of course ) . 
  indeed , especially from a german point of view , your export industry has been flourishing partly because of the euro . 
  not every country can say they benefited as much as germany by adopting it ( i 'm not criticising germany , just to be clear ) . 
  that 's what i said , it 's quite marginal . 
  the other raises i mentionned , the baguette and chicken , are very much tolerable , we 're far from venezuela 's situation . 
  but if you include the other increases for various products , people notice . 
  and they wrongly associate it with the euro , which is why some people keep repeating : `` since we adopted the euro , everything is more expensive !! '', 
  conclusion : we agree , i was just giving some figures for france, 
  the problem is people are trying to openly spread islam in europe . 
  and we 're a few not so happy about it . 
  nothing to do with muslims , but people who actively try to impose their backward ideology more and more and who think this is cruisades ' time all over again are a fucking pain in the ass , for everyone . 
  they drag us back , and we want to move forward . 
  no one is trying to spread atheism in saudi arabia , algeria or indonesia . 
   but what matters equally ( and what is ignored by many people ) is that the everyday prices ( rent , utility , services ) has actually decreased . 
  that is not what happened in france in the first years . 
  i found the numbers of insee ( the national institute of statistics and economic studies , best source for this ) . 
  so , overall , prices have raised by +0,12 % in 2001 , then +0,16 % in 2002 . 
  for the service industry ( caf\u00e9 , restaurants , etc. . . ) : +0,8 % ( the highest of all sectors ) for food prices : +0,4 % those are 2 examples of prices raising because of the euro . 
  and it 's quite marginal . 
  now , a lot of products got more expensive between 2002 and 2010 . 
  for example a baguette 's price rose by 27 % or a chicken 's ( kg ) by 47 % . 
  the thing is , a lot of people associate this with the euro . 
  but it has nothing to do with it . 
  it 's because of the lack of competition or the lack of price control . 
  mmmh ... 
  it seems you 're right and [ my online dictionnary has failed me . 
  ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/fren/anecdotique ) i edited . 
  a `` minor topic '' then . 
  less than 5.000 people ( out of millions muslims ) marching against islamist violence is absolutely ~ ~ anecdotal ~ ~ a minor topic in france . 
  the fact that this is apparently considered to be as i 'm writing the 5th most important news in r/europe is indeed quite meaningful . 
  who would upvote this ? 
  this march is great and i 'm glad to see muslims march to pay tribute to the couple . 
  i do n't doubt for a second the large majority of them is horrified by this slaughter . 
  i did n't downvote it , but i do n't see how less than 5.000 people ( half of that according to the police ) marching is european news . 
  it 's ~ ~ anecdotal ~ ~ a minor topic at best . 
  yeah you 're awesome we know, 
  so they have to start a revolution , like my country and many others did , to change things around . 
  this is not outsiders ' job to do this . 
   its ' not a simple yes/no tag , being democratic . 
  it is . 
  you elect your leader and representatives who belong or not to multiple political parties = democracy .
