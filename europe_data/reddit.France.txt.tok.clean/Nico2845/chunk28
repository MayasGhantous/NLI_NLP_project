  so until 2020 ireland should be a net beneficiary . 
  [ here is a more detailed explanation . 
  ] ( http://www.publicpolicy.ie/eu-budget-ireland/ ), 
  of course he is , i 'm just saying it does n't help to solve the whole violence problem to make an announcement like this . 
  [ yes here . 
  ] ( http://www.sofoot.com/le-poing-hooligan-round-1-223515.html ) there is also a `` round 2 '' . 
  they have an active french `` hool '' who gives his opinion as well as nicolas hourcade , the only sociologist in france who works on supporter movements . 
  very good read . 
   `` during this time of ramadan , there was one group that wanted to strictly observe the fast , and another that insisted on the usual timetables and usual servings , '' said ralf herrenbrueck , spokesman for the prosecutors service . 
   `` this had led on several occasions to disputes and altercations with officials of the german red cross , '' he said in an interview with public broadcaster wdr . 
   `` it got to the point where threats were made over what would happen if things did n't change , and one threat was obviously implemented . '', 
  [ from the afp article . 
  ] ( https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ramadan-row-behind-fire-german-refugee-shelter-092156833.html ) if they served meals for non-muslims at regular mealtimes and a late meal for muslims , how do you explain this ? 
  considering it 's apparently non-muslims who set the building in fire , what are your conclusions ? 
  there was a very instructive article in so foot ( do n't know if you 're french ) about how the german and british polices were very good at handling violent group of supporters . 
  basically , they know the leaders , they know when to intervene while the french police is just gon na charge and beat up everybody , making everything worse . 
  you can see it now in protests how instead of controlling violent protesters they just draw more and more of them . 
  not defending anyone , but [ the english hooligan `` the pig of marseille '' calling all brits and russians to `` attack muslims in marseille '' ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/euro-2016/le-hooligan-anglais-the-pig-of-marseille-veut-agresser-des-musulmans-pendant-l-euro-23-05-2016-5822817.php ) might not have helped . 
  this phrasing is confusing , i understand it as they were served their meal with muslims observing ramadan . 
  otherwise it does n't make sense : `` a meal was served , a group of people complained . '', 
  where do you see they were served a meal at the regular mealtimes in this ? 
  if they were forced to eat late as fuck , they sure had to participate against their will . 
  hahahaha cool to see not everybody knows about you yet . 
  yeah it appears you 're right . 
  it 's still odd , i mean wwi had also a massive number of deaths , not as much as wwii but still . 
  usually wikipedia is pretty complete about wwii . 
  english is not my first language , casualties is always confusing to me since it can mean `` wounded '' , `` dead '' or both . 
  for example the wiki page [ `` world war ii casualties '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties ) only includes the death toll by country , it does n't include the wounded . 
  if you count the wounded yeah . 
   between the nazis and communists , america has suffered millions of casualties huh no , not even close . 
  i disagree with the guy you replied to though . 
   to quote him : `` when you discuss issues , we immediately go into details , '' he said about the czechs and some neighbouring countries . 
  `` in western europe , you start from the big idea . 
  you agree this is the goal and then you work on the implementation policies '' , he said . 
  that is indeed very interesting , it makes a lot of sense when you look at the tensions in eu discussions between western/eastern europeans . 
  holy fuck , we 're like opposite human beings . 
  my biggest trauma ( well , maybe not ) is traveling on a bus with air con that was so cold i was ready to murder the driver . 
  man , you seem like a nice guy but we should n't travel together hahaha !, 
  ( that was a fake laugh , you 're probably the driver of that bus and i want to murder you ), 
  yeah , i guess sarcasm is not your thing on the internet . 
  well they do actually and they 're very good at it , it 's just at the olympics though . 
  i guess it 's just a habit . 
  the thing i hate about air conditioning is when you get in a shop/someone 's home and it 's like 18 \u00b0 c inside , then you go back out and it 's 35 \u00b0 c , oh shit i forgot my wallet wait a second 18 \u00b0 c then again 35 \u00b0 c. 
  i always end up sick in hot countries where air conditioning is in every building because of temperature differences . 
  when you 'll be able to spell properly in your own language you 'll make fun of people who speak yours you uneducated twat . 
  [ nice skitt 's law example . 
  ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/internet_law#skitt.27s_law )  i didnt * `` i did n't '' * or * `` i did not '' * . 
  english 101 . 
  downvoting but not replying now huh ? 
  top tier comment there , keep it up deepshit . 
  i replied after moron , read what i said before posting . 
  i do n't see how i lost the argument , he reposted my link that does n't even have the data to support his stupid claim . 
  ok then ...  then please explain the big chunk of afghani and pakistani ... do n't even know what that means . 
  big chunk of afghani and pakistani in europe or in australia ? 
  what does it have to do with what i said before ? 
   do n't be silly : http://www.asrc.org.au/resources/statistics/detention-and-refugee-statistics/ that 's my link i gave before that does n't has the data to support your claim . 
  if you 're not a troll you 're completely dumb lol , that puts an end to this conversation either way . 
  good night , 
  ok so you 're a troll . 
   nope - if you are to read the newspapers , there was always the `` dangerous dingy thingy '' . 
  ah , so you want to compare the 4km that seperates lesbos from turkey to what an asian refugee has to cross to get to australia ? 
  4km on the sea , that are part of a couple thousands km journey by foot . 
   agree . 
  why should this be our problem ? 
  i also object to the broad usage of term `` refugees '' . 
  until their status is determined they are migrants . 
  gulf countries are pieces of shit , no doubt about it and they should take their share . 
   apparently this `` refugees '' do n't just want to come to europe . 
  they want to come to germany and sweden . 
  shall i remind you the story of the afghans crying when they learnt they are in romania or the `` refugees '' laughing in the face of portugal 's pm . 
  oh , and do n't forget the `` macaron in croatia '' . 
  you 're digressing here . 
   because they could easily come to europe and it 's next to impossible to go to us or canada ? 
  i 'm just gon na quote you :  why does distance matters ? 
  and last point :  wrt australia : before they introduced the draconian rules wrt illegal migration , there were plenty of people dead on the sea , after that , none !, 
  that 's false , you have no data to support it , and it 's again irrelevant considering the very small influx australia is getting . 
   we have islands wat . 
  did you seriously completely misunderstood what i meant by this ? 
  as far as i remember , europe is not surrounded by water . 
  hundreds of thousands of refugees reached europe by foot , so controlling the borders of europe is different . 
   why does distance matters ? 
  saudi arabia is even closer btw . 
  because refugees want to come to europe , not saudi arabia . 
  and yeah , distance does n't matter , why do n't they go straight to the us or canada i wonder ? 
  i do n't know if you recall the rohingya refugees from burma , but do n't you think they would have headed for australia instead of malaysia that shunned them if they could have reached it ? 
  look at the map and see the distance between australia and its closest neighbours , then look at europe and the distance with libya . 
  or even better the distance between greece and turkey since they 're coming from there , clearly why does distance matter ?? 
   because they did n't wait for centuries before rejecting ( to safe places ) absolutely everyone !, 
  [ here you can look at the ridiculous numbers of illegal immigrants detained by australia . 
  ] ( http://www.asrc.org.au/resources/statistics/detention-and-refugee-statistics/ ) at the highest peak since 2011 , australia had 2,365 people detained offshore . 
  a country the size of the whole europe . 
  now , remind me again how we can apply this system with our situation , where we have 10 times more migrants arriving daily ? 
  i often see the example of australia coming up , but there are 3 `` little things '' that come to mind when i hear this : * australia is an island . 
  * australia does n't have war-torn countries a few hundred kilometers from its borders . 
  * australia was never even close to experience an influx of refugees like europe is seeing today . 
  also , we already have a third party country that keeps migrants for the eu , it 's morocco . 
  we had another one , even though it was an informal agreement , that is called libya . 
  and we have new ones , that are called turkey and lebanon . 
  well we disagree then . 
  ok , i 'm sorry but park chung-hee is the worst example you could have taken .
