  yes , also it 's worth noting that hitler had some kind of obsession for paris and was particularly mad that it was intact . 
  his idea was that berlin should become the `` new '' paris , so when he saw berlin getting completely destroyed , while paris was still there standing untouched , despite being under german control for years , he could n't accept the idea that his dream would never come true and thought that the french did n't deserve the city so it should be destroyed like berlin . 
  thanks to von choltitz and nordling 's amazing diplomatic skills it did not happen . 
  hitler was completely insane at the end and many of his collaborators realised it , no doubt about that . 
  still , he had a lot of them who remained loyals to him until the end . 
  hell , the war would have ended a lot earlier if it was n't the case . 
  also , refusing to carry the order meant von choltitz 's wife and children were going to get a bullet in the head , as hitler ordered for all officers who refused to obey him . 
  actually hitler gave the order to destroy paris , bombs had been placed in the louvre , the eiffel tower , on every bridge and all major sites in the city , but dietrich von choltitz , the german governor of paris during the occupation , refused to carry the order . 
  it was the swedish ambassador in paris , raoul nordling , who convinced him that destroying one of the most beautiful city in the world would bring nothing to anyone , and that it would just be a loss for humanity . 
  if you 're interested [ there is a very nice french-german movie on this called * diplomacy * , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomacy_%282014_film%29 ) it is basically the conversations between von choltitz and nordling before the free french get to paris and how the latter convinced the former not to destroy paris . 
  daesh blew up saudis as well and considers the gulf monarchies as one of their main targets . 
  it does n't mean they have no sympathizers in qatar or saudi arabia . 
  i 'm not comparing turkey to these countries , i know they are completely different , but you ca n't deny there are 2 turkey : the one tourists see in istanbul and the much , much conservative in smaller cities and rural areas . 
  and everywhere islamists started making non-violent demands such as banning alcohol or pornography , the violence is always what comes next . 
  see algeria in the early 90s . 
  this is always a small minority that is deemed irrelevant , until this small group completely fuck up the entire country . 
  [ that is not the first time for putin . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvlfqxfriuq ), 
   the germans were unable to move supplies and reinforcements fast enough to maintain their advance . 
  the fast-moving stormtroopers leading the attack could not carry enough food and ammunition to sustain themselves for long and all the german offensives petered out , in part through lack of supplies . 
   ** by late april 1918 , the danger of a german breakthrough had passed . 
  ** the german army had suffered heavy casualties and now occupied ground of dubious value which would prove impossible to hold with such depleted units . 
   ** in august 1918 ** , the allies began a counter-offensive with the support of 1 -- 2 million fresh american troops and using new artillery techniques and operational methods . 
  and that 's the introduction of the link you gave , did you even read it ? 
  the american troops did n't save anybody , they helped during the counter-offensive that ultimately lead to germany 's defeat . 
   citations , how do they work !? 
  no idea what you mean . 
   open forums , how do they work ?!, 
  that was still quite pathetic my friend . 
  a link to a comment from an indian student on quora really ? 
  also , browsing my history to reply to a comment on another thread is quite pathetic . 
  that 's complete crap . 
  [ wwi was the beginning of the us ' rise as a world power . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-world-war-i-helped-america-rise-to-superpower-status-a-944703.html )  the us 's entry into the war in 1917 marked the beginning of its path to becoming a world power . 
  in fact , according to historian herfried m\u00fcnkler , this was precisely the goal of some politicians in washington . 
  treasury secretary william gibbs mcadoo , a son-in-law of president woodrow wilson , was already forging plans to replace the pound sterling with the dollar as the foremost international reserve currency . 
  even the dollar was pretty much irrelevant internationally before wwi . 
  i know where all of this come from , i studied us history quite extensively as i said later in the original conversation . 
  i was just saying that all this would never be accepted in france . 
  it was n't a criticism or anything , just a remark on how we have a different interpretation of what secularism is . 
  well as i said , it was a very sneaky law and it was not mentionned officially that the target was the burqa . 
  but i think you 're right and it would not have passed in the us . 
  it 's true , we have quite an `` extreme '' view on what securalism should be . 
  just one thing though , the burqa ban is not a burqa ban , it 's a law that makes it illegal to have the face covered on the street , there is no mention of a religious covering being illegal . 
  of course it was aimed at women wearing burqa but also at people wearing masks and throwing stones at the police in protests . 
  this is why the european court of human rights validated the law and said it was not a violation of religious freedom . 
  i studied american history in university and what you said about putting god everywhere during the cold war is spot on . 
  mccarthyism and the hysteria that came with it really did harm secularism in the us . 
  it 's a very sneaky way to put pressure on anybody who 's not religious or christian . 
  like , `` you do n't have to say the pledge or say ` under god ' , but you 'll have to face the consequences . '', 
  imagine if clinton does n't use a bible , some people would get absolutely mental . 
  right now we have a big debate on secularism in france . 
  the whole idea was to destroy or limit the church 's influence , but now it 's more about how do we deal with muslims and islam who demand a lot . 
  yeah culturally speaking a majority would say christian , but not religiously . 
  while this is correct that church and state are seperated , the us is a really special country . 
  from the `` in god we trust '' on every dollar bill to your president taking oath on the bible , you have a very weird interpretation of what is secularism from a french point of view . 
  actually a majority of our population defines itself as non-religious or atheist . 
  yeah i just checked and i have no idea where op got these numbers . 
   well then let 's have a confederation of independent nations instead of a federation of european states . 
  the eu is neither a confederation or a federation . 
   that way our countries are n't run by brussels , but we still get to act together in relation to usa , china and russia . 
  our countries are n't ran by brussels , and the eu is specifically what allows us to act together in relation to the us or china . 
  indeed , symbolically it 's quite something . 
  yeah we 're the country that relies the most on nuclear energy on the planet . 
  now you understand why our government quickly deploys troops when some jihadists decide to sneak around places that provide a lot of uranium to us . 
  i ca n't speak for everybody but i know that in france it 's a legal problem . 
  if a woman wants to get surgery to become a man , she just has to go to a doctor . 
  but if she wants to become legally recognized as a man , she needs to get sterilization because she could get pregnant , which is biologically impossible for a man . 
  and a kid could end up with 2 mothers or 2 fathers . 
  so that 's roughly the justification from judges , it would pose a problem on the legal definition of what is a man or a woman . 
  in my opinion this is a completely outdated view , especially since we legalized gay marriage and adoption . 
  a kid can already legally have 2 mothers or 2 fathers . 
  those are 2 articles are about oil drilling in libya by total , how is it related to us shale gas ? 
  how did we get punished under cdg ? 
  can we join ? 
  it sounded fun the first time but we did n't get the invitation :(, 
  hey by no means i wanted to undermine the essential role the us played in wwii , just saying what i ( and other people ) have experienced . 
  of course this is an uneducated minority , but so far i have n't seen this with brits or russians . 
   in the western popular imagination -- particularly the american one -- world war ii is a conflict we won . 
  not particularly , ** only ** the american . 
  and do n't get me wrong , people in france remember the american soldiers who bravely delivered us ( along with british , canadian and other nations ' soldiers ) , and their sacrifice is learned by every single french kid in school , but i 've only heard americans claiming they won alone wwii . 
  you do know that [ the dgse has already a massive surveillance system as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frenchelon ) and basically listens and intercepts pretty much all the communications going in/out of france right ? 
  exactly , you summed it up very well . 
  not so long ago i read an article on this topic and a former dgse senior officer was basically saying that the difference between different agencies are huge . 
  french , british and germans are historically very active and are ready to act `` agressively '' if needed so , whereas this is the opposite for swedes or belgians who would act more `` softly '' . 
  collaboration is possible , but the differences between services means they would never agree on how to act . 
   populists getting protest votes ? 
  they are n't going to win any national election , le pen is a joke . 
  yeah , they just won a european election , but winning a national election ? 
  unthinkable . 
  by the way the `` joke '' multiplied by 11 its number of elected representatives nationwide , from 181 in 2012 to 1 992 in 2015 . 
  since 2007 they multiplied by 12 the number of their militants , people who actually pay money to be part of the party , from 7 000 to 83 000 . 
  no one is laughing but you moron . 
   such as ? 
  i do n't know , pis in poland or orb\u00e1n and his lovely fidesz-mpsz in hungary ... do you read news sometimes ? 
   no , i 'm saying that the vast majority of people will never have the time to even begin to understand the complexities of leaving or joining something like the eu . 
  that 's exactly what i said : `` people should n't vote because they 're too stupid '' . 
   and grow up before you next reply . 
  nice argument . 
   but simple put , brexit is n't really going to happen are you a soothsayer ?
