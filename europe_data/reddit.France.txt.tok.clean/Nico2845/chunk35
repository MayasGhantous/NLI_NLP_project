   scotland did n't have any intention of leaving the eu their referendum was about leaving the uk ...  catalonia wants to join the eu straight away ( if it did vote for independence ) . 
  how does this mean they want more federalization ? 
  do you think they want to gain independence to then push for being just a federal region of europe and give up the power they just got ? 
  that makes no sense at all . 
   there are almost no popular movements to move away from the eu man you 're just delusional . 
  in france , the front national , who clearly states it wants to leave the eu , won the last european elections . 
  they won . 
  marine le pen is expected to be runner-up at the next presidential elections . 
  you should also take a look at what political parties are currently raising in eastern europe . 
   although it should be in the form of voting for a party , referendums are in general a pretty horrible idea . 
  ah , i see , you 're one of those `` people should n't vote because they 're too stupid '' kind of person . 
  and i 'm saying all this being rather pro-eu , i just acknowledge reality . 
  really ? 
  brexit , the scotland referendum on independence , catalonia wanting to have its own , separatists and nationalists political movements and parties making massive gains , including in european elections , and you think we 're heading towards federalisation ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  he does . 
  so un-original from you ireland , [ here we have our own unique super hero !,

  interesting ( no s / ), 
  metro is the one of the biggest if not the biggest supplier for businesses in france as well , and has even been opened to the general public ( with different prices ) for a while now . 
  it 's huge here as well and everyone knows it . 
  i guess there is another reason why the newspaper did n't expand in romania . 
  til then . 
  seriously you never heard of metro newspapers ? 
  [ that 's a massive press group , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro_international ) i 'm surprised you do n't have it in romania as well . 
  no need to go that far , plenty of people in the us need help already , including 50.000 veterans living on the street . 
  found the american . 
  i 'm not op and you 're right , there is no definite proof that the chemical attack was conducted by rebels . 
  and it 's not `` a clear cut-case '' that it was assad last time or this time . 
  [ but as this dw article points out , it makes little sense for assad to do it .

  indeed it 's pretty good !, 
   just be very careful - due to its security and being beyond most of the law , it 's a wild west . 
  it has drug shop sites ( like silk road ) , weapon-selling sites , and worse . 
  well let 's be honest , you do n't end up there by mistake . 
  the adresses of these sites are very easy to get , but it 's a deliberate action to use them , not random . 
  i put one on my webcam 4 years ago and now everytime i have to remove it i feel literally naked .

   in 2004 all encryption was made legal during raffarin governement ( right wing ) . 
  interesting , i did n't know that . 
  knowing raffarin he probably had no fucking clue what encryption is . 
  even the one in croissant shape ? 
  til we do n't know exactly where christopher columbus was born . 
  well , i do n't think so . 
  she never really gave a shit about jews and always focused on muslims and foreigners at large . 
  i mean , you wo n't find any statement from her about jews coming even close to the stupidity reached by her father almost every month . 
  when she does n't like a group , she does n't put gloves to attack it . 
  this is exactly what she 's talking about . 
  her point is collaborators did it , not `` france '' . 
  they are not separatists though . 
   calais was the result of the french goverment going all out to fuck the refugees by letting them rot on their way to the uk rather than officially register them and keep them in france . 
  what ? 
  the whole problem is that they refuse to register because they want to go to the uk and not stay in france ... 
  are you saying gays in the us ca n't feed themselves ? 
  like , seriously . 
  yeah , blaming taxis for keeping prices artificially low ? 
  that 's a first . 
  anywhere i went on this planet the problem was the exact opposite , maybe op lives in an alternate reality where people organize protests because cabs are too damn cheap !, 
  a lot of people will never vote for m\u00e9lenchon , and a lot of people would never vote for le pen . 
  it would probably be the lowest participation in a second turn . 
  one says 68 % for m\u00e9lenchon and 32 % for le pen . 
  the other says 54 % for m\u00e9lenchon and 46 % for le pen . 
  that is drastically different . 
  and the second one if far from being a comfortable win . 
  comfortably ? 
  i do n't think you understand how m\u00e9lenchon is perceived by right wing voters and moderate left voters here , that would be extremely tight . 
  parisian level = master . 
  the worst to me are the one who lean against the bar in the middle squishing hands when the metro is packed . 
   why are all your youth working in western europe cleaning toilets ? 
  that 's the weirdest from my french point of view , never heard of estonians coming here to clean toilets .

  have you ever wondered why every communist regime ended up like this ? 
  that maybe communism is nothing more than an utopia and confronted to the reality of our world , communist leaders can not actually apply its principles because it does not work ? 
  the `` not real communism '' fallacy is so overused i ca n't even understand how people can still fall for it . 
  we 're not talking about a couple of communist regimes that went the wrong way . 
  we 're talking about every single one of them - and they are dozens - who all went horribly wrong on every continent and in all their variants . 
  but please , write an essay about how you 're different . 
  well he 's not entirely wrong in the sense that this is an italian train as much as an audi made in czech republic is a czech car . 
  maybe the frecciarossa 1000 as someone mentioned earlier in the thread would have been a better example of an italian high-speed train .

  good . 
  do n't flog yourself for it though . 
  we 're frenching in english , so i used `` smurf '' . 
  oh it 's much more than that , my friend . 
  think of it like `` smurf '' is used by the smurfs .

  for fuck sake , you have nativity scenes in churches , at home and in your catholic schools . 
  is it that hard to leave baby jesus and his mom with her hijab out of the public town hall ? 
  i ca n't believe she thought about this when the topic discussed was the institutions of the republic and what the candidates wanted to change . 
  what the actual fuck , i liked how m\u00e9lenchon pretended to be confused at first and asked several times what the hell she was talking about . 
  it 's normal , being good at frenching takes a lot of practice .
