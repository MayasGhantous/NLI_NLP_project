  well , m\u00e9lenchon crushed her when she said she wanted to change the constitution to allow town halls to set up nativity scenes ( a top priority in our current situation , as everyone can see ) . 
   honestly ~ ~ the ~ ~ dutch and french ~ ~ versions ~ ~ sound much more empowering than ~ ~ the ~ ~ english ~ ~ translation . ~ ~ better now, 
  til about these men too !, 
  just half . 
  i always thought it was a ripoff of [ the rising sun flag of imperial japan . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/war_flag_of_the_imperial_japanese_army.svg/1280px-war_flag_of_the_imperial_japanese_army.svg.png ) but your version makes a lot more sense obviously . 
  interesting , i did not know that . 
  well , it does n't seem this brotherhood against oppression between russians and poles is coming back anytime soon now : /, 
   decabrites pardon me but who is that ? 
  ca n't find anything about it when i google it . 
  also , does that mean that there was some kind of `` brotherhood '' between russian and polish populace ? 
  like , we 're both oppressed by the tsar , let 's fight for freedom together kind of thing ? 
  thanks for the reply btw . 
  no sarcasm , to whom does `` yours '' refer to in the 2nd one ? 
  yes he tried !, 
  perfect illustration of the failure of german humour . 
  no one understands them . 
  no one . 
  `` oh come on , [ these missiles ? 
  ] ( http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/iran-website1.jpg ) it 's fine man , stop overreacting . '', 
   and it was harsher for france as they were n't occupied in the first world war . 
  we lost 1,5 million men , with an extra 1,9 million wounded ( most heavily ) in wwi . 
  that 's 1 man out of 3 aged 17 to 45 year old . 
  do you have any idea of the effect it had on the birth rate , the work force and the national pshyche in general ? 
  wwii was not nearly as bad for us , even with the occupation . 
  of course there are good ultras , and they represent by far the majority of ultras . 
  i have been a thousand time with ultras in the stands , some of my friends still are part of ultra groups . 
  they hate hooligans and do n't want to have anything to do with them . 
  i just proved you do n't even know the definition of the words you use . 
  but ok . 
  [ to contrast : ** to compare ** in order to show unlikeness or differences . 
  ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/contrasting ) read the definition of words you do n't understand before using them , smart guy . 
  ah this stupid comparison again . 
  yes , yes , the guy who ran over and killed 86 people in nice is the same than a guy losing control of his car and killing 2 people because a rabbit crossed the road . 
  no difference , a death is a death right ? 
  an esa mission saving a nasa one ... well , that 's one tv show that wo n't be bought by american tv channels , that 's for sure . 
  looks quite good and ambitious , hope they had a decent budget and it wo n't look cheap . 
  also hope they did n't fuck up the science parts . 
  you have no right to be in new zealand , new zealander . 
  that 's colonialism and you know it . 
  go back to ... somewhere . 
  now . 
  and gib kiwis, 
  yeah , the way they run to keep beating him up after he got ran over by the car is horrible . 
  hope they get charged with attempted murder . 
  ah ok i see what you mean , fair enough then . 
   we 're not the ones trying to cherry pick  cherry picking cuts both ways . 
  you contradict yourself . 
   we 're not the ones trying to cherry pick the nature of the relationship here . 
  holy shit if it 's not sarcasm that has to be the most dishonest comment by a british on brexit i 've ever read . 
  why not with the wings this is exactly op 's story ... 
  could n't you at least try to be mean ? 
  you ruined everything netherlands , everything . 
  they do that as well of course , waving can be just an extra courtesy . 
  a waving hand can mean a lot of different things , a plane can wave to signal he acknowledged the position of a castaway who fired a distress flare for instance . 
  in the case of op it can mean `` follow me '' or `` all clear , i 'm leaving now '' . 
  apparently it was the second one in his case . 
   they did do a little wing-wiggle for the benefit of the passengers though  it 's called a wing wave and it was most likely adressed to the pilots of your plane after the f15 crew talked to them and made sure everything is clear . 
  it 's a common signal between pilots , it 's meant to be like waving a hand . 
  basically [ this ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/t9fhnacjjq8ba/giphy.gif ) and [ this . 
  [ so it begins ... ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/009/994/foreboding-gandalf.jpg ), 
  taking a shower ? 
  never heard of that here . 
  is it a mexican expression for beheading people from the rival cartel ? 
  oh i did n't know this one , thanks !, 
  i have a `` trash '' email adress anyway but it can be handful . 
   show me any chart supporting gay marriage in the 1980s . 
  show me any chart where almost everybody was against gay marriage in the 1980s . 
  you made this claim , i did n't make any . 
   ok , being against abortion is not backwards . 
  yes , this is literally being backwards , it would be going back 50 years ago . 
  literally going backwards . 
  there are plenty of reasons why paris is a tiny financial centre compared to london , but lack of knowledge and specialisation are not some of them . 
  interesting . 
  indeed , concrete actions should be the only way to measure this , not statements . 
   what sector they are active in . 
  finance . 
  which is why , unsurprisingly , this is the french financial markets regulation authority that is dealing with their case as it 's written in the title . 
  they 're not bringing anything exceptional that we do n't have , just some money and a few jobs . 
  the whole modern concept of state , secularism , freedom of religion , the republican model and democracy were built in opposition to the church and the monarchy during the enlightment . 
  this is an historical fact . 
  that does n't mean christianism did n't also contribute greatly to our civilisation in many aspects like science or arts . 
  i know it did . 
  the two points are not mutually exclusive . 
   oh , please . 
  30 years ago almost everybody was against gay marriage . 
  you might want to check what the 1980 's looked like in western europe ...  being against abortion is not evil . 
  evil ? 
  we talked about backwards , stop purposely putting words i 've never written into my mouth . 
  words that have a completely different meaning . 
  and claiming to have the right to say what a woman can do with her own body is backwards . 
   just because something does n't meet your own moral standards does n't make it backwards . 
  my moral standards are the majority , by far . 
  the majority of my country is atheist . 
  the majority of my country is pro gay marriage . 
  the majority of my country supports abortion . 
  the majority of my country wants a strict seperation of religion and state . 
  and so do most european countries . 
  poland is a small religious minority in the eu . 
  the sooner you realise you 're not a driving force and you never will the better for everybody .
