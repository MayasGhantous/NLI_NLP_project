  just tried to check what they were saying on their website about it ... 
  it 's fucking mandatory to subscribe to their newsletter and you have to confirm your email . 
  and these are the people who are supposed to be the best of the best to attract businesses to paris . 
  i guess they 're still trying to figure out why people only stay 5 seconds on their website that probably costed 1m $ to build . 
  oh ok , i 'm as clueless as you about this . 
  they certainly did n't hire him for his tan though . 
  well there are plenty of examples really , it 's worse if you compare your gdp with ukraine or we have roughly the same gdp than india and they have 19 times our population . 
   it birthed the west . 
  christianity and its love-thy-neighbour ethos is fundamental to who we are . 
  i do n't deny the influence christianity had on us , both positive and negative , i 'm saying you 're one of the very last country to think it 's a driving force nowadays or that it is still a relevant thing . 
  we dropped it , fought very hard to destroy the infuence it had and we 're not getting backwards . 
  also it did n't `` birth the west '' , the enlightment that started to attack the church is what made us so powerful and free . 
  the exact opposition of christianity . 
   backwards in what way ? 
  and backwards vs what ? 
  against gay marriage and adoption , against abortion , against condoms , etc. . . [ i think the worst i 've seen here is catholics marching hands in hands with islamists against gay marriage . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-marriage-muslim-idusbre9060it20130107 ) fyi the uoif mentionned in the article is the muslim brotherhood branch in france , an egyptian salafi movement . 
  that 's how backward christians can be . 
  you rich viking gib money pls, 
  i do n't know , but i assume that the already low-quality chocolate bars distributed by giant corporations got worse after the ruling . 
  if cadbury did it i 'm sure they all jumped on the train . 
   but i have the feeling that chocolate quality was much better in the past . 
  that 's because it was , you can thanks the european court of justice and cadbury for forcing us to to accept chocolate that could n't legally be called that before . 
  [ it was called `` the chocolate war '' . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2003/world/europe/01/16/chocolate.war/ ), 
  we 're talking tiny consulting firms with less than 10 employees , not exactly big news . 
  i would n't say christianity is necessarly far right , but it 's definitely backwards from a western point of view as well as for the scandinavian countries just above you . 
  same for czech republic and slovakia below you as well actually . 
  so , what you see as a great potential for the future is some backwards relic of the past for most of us . 
  you better wake up and realise you 're not the model but the opposite regarding this , because we 're certainly not moving backwards and looking up to you my friend . 
  it 's gerrymandering , not secession . 
  and dakota was split in two after the civil war , so there is a precedent . 
  it 's called [ gerrymandering ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerrymandering ) and it 's an american ( and french ) political speciality . 
  doing it for a state is quite new as far as i can tell , but someone corrects me if i 'm wrong . 
   fuck me , 0 to trump in 60 seconds oh he went easy on you , he called me [ an extreme nationalist le pen supporter ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60tge3/londonparis_electric_flight_in_decade_bbc_news/df98m8y/ ) because i dared claim the eurotunnel was a great british-french project that was unique . 
  can they fly though, 
  well charles babbage is considered to be the father of the computer . 
  and tim berners-lee did not invent the internet but he did invent the world wide web . 
  well i should have included it in my original comment , as you said that was a pretty big claim so i should have backed it up . 
  sure , [ there is this consumer report from 2015 . 
  ] ( https://static.clarkhoward.com/clark-howard_731191538.jpg ) with the exception of audi , german brands are very average or below average for mercedes . 
  [ in this reliability index , ] ( http://www.reliabilityindex.com/ ) one german car ( mercedes-benz clc ) makes it to the top 10 of the best cars . 
  they make up 7 of the top 10 of the worst . 
  [ this report from warrantwise ] ( http://www.warrantywise.co.uk/blog/warrantywise-data-german-car-brands-reliability/ ) sums up pretty much the difference between what consumers think about german cars and the reality . 
  just to be clear , i 'm not saying german cars are bad or shitty , just that their reputation as `` very reliable cars '' is overrated . 
  i 've always thought these propaganda posters looked like some kind of desperate attempt to scare the soldiers . 
  `` we 're very very very strong !!, 
  ^ so ^ do n't ^ attack ^ pls '' but well , i 'm not a wwi soldier so i 'm not sure what effect it actually had on them . 
  til , i did not know about that . 
  university ? 
  yep , and that 's particularly true for cars . 
  in pretty much all reliability indexes , german cars are very average when not the worst . 
  but most people still believe that a vw or an audi will last forever . 
  oooh that 's why we were n't getting any news from them that year . 
  great for slovenia , their murder rate just quadrupled . 
  spain is the largest exporter of wine in the world ** because ** they do n't have a big domestic consumption . 
  [ the fake scotch tape in the corners ... ] ( http://m.memegen.com/dyod6y.jpg ), 
   le pen did n't make a single direct reference to the european currency , even when the debate turned to the question of how to strengthen buying power . 
  not a single direct reference ?? 
  are you fucking kidding me ... she held a graph to show how bad the euro is for everyone except germany , it was so ridiculous that it became a meme here and it was one of the `` highlight '' of the debate . 
  basically her graph was industrial production before and after the euro . 
  [ you can see it here . ] ( https://imgur.com/uyk2fpk ) . 
  she said i quote :  `` do n't you think there is a link between the euro and these curves [ going down ] ? 
  personally , i believe so . '', 
  everybody attacked her on that because her graph was pure manoeuvring . 
  [ here is the video . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5fhtxw_le-grand-debat-marine-le-pen-devient-la-risee-du-web-avec-son-graphique-video_tv ) [ here is an article from le monde debunking her graph on the euro . 
  if you did n't watch the debate and do n't speak french , of course . 
  yes , do n't you know that the terrorist of yesterday , who was ** british ** , was terrorised by the daily bombing of his house in london by british troops ? 
  / s i love how some people will scream about people putting all muslims in the same box ( which is a totally legit point , do n't get me wrong ) but then will refer to terrorists as `` them '' , like they 're iraquis or syrians getting bombed since they 're children ? 
  they completely ignore the fact that they 're british , french or belgian . 
  accusing muslims of terrorism is wrong , but treating all muslims as victims is right . 
  great mental gymnastic . 
  ok you 're the exception and ` nazdrowie ' and ` kurwa ' are pretty mainstream , i 'll give you that !, 
  deal !, 
  let me concentrate to grow a hatred for hungary now . 
   \u0107evapi how much \u0107evapi do you offer . 
  very cool , thanks !, 
  slavic languages are really unknown in western europe which is a shame , i think a lot of misunderstandings come from this unfortunately . 
  while you 're exposed to french , german or spanish cultures/languages we do n't really hear much from you very broadly speaking : / that 's the kind of stuff i 'd like the eu to do things about . 
   unless the langauge is hungarian . 
  do n't drag me into a war i have to process what you taught me already !, 
  ah ok thanks !, 
  not sure when it 'll be useful to me but always nice to learn something about languages . 
  so basically the english words `` hurt '' and `` church '' but with a `` z '' before and instead of the `` c '' ? 
   \u017ert / \u017er\u0107 and as someone with no knowledge of your language , i am not 100 % sure how it is supposed to be pronounced . 
  we were talking about trade , not the eu budget . 
   the top comment itself is off topic and focuses on the route instead of focusing on the technology . 
  of all the routes , they go with the one that has a ** direct high speed rail ** connection . '', 
  it 's specifically focusing on the technology of the route ...  if the uk invaded france 100 years earlier , the tunnel channel would have not been a joint project between 2 countries . 
  yes . 
  and if [ insert an imaginary scenario ] this [ insert an imaginary project ] would n't have been . 
  very , very interesting point . 
  this conversation is pointless anyway , do n't see the point in arguing with someone who just wants to troll . 
  as dawkins said ,  you know you 've won the argument when the only counter argument they can find is that you are white or male or old . 
   why did you even think about the channel tunnel ? 
  only a petty french nationalist does that . 
  [ the top comment of the thread talks about it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60tge3/londonparis_electric_flight_in_decade_bbc_news/df95j0b/ ) the top comment . 
  and he 's not even french .
