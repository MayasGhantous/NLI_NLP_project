  ** you ** want to join a club , the eu , and ** we ** as the members decide what the rules are to get the membership . 
  feel free to find another club if you 're not happy with it . 
   unless the french go absolutely insane do n't underestimate us . 
  ever . 
  there is also a kind of thinking from a lot of baby-boomers that is very problematic . 
  the typical fillon voter thinks `` young people are lazy and do n't want to work like we did !, 
  '' , they just simply refuse to acknowledge that our reality is completely different than theirs in the 1960s and they are the one in power now . 
  unemployment is just a vague concept to them , it was just non-existent when they were our age . 
  seriously , the number of baby-boomers capable of saying with a straight face that well , retiring at 60 is not possible anymore , you ca n't have as much social benefits as we did and you have to work harder !, 
  is insane . 
  i see you 're still at the stage where you put the blame of your current internal situation on europe . 
  well , still a long way to go before we have a normal relationship again then . 
  he 's getting heavily downvoted but he 's not wrong in this specific discussion though . 
  a frenchman who was born from senegalese parents who came straight from africa is french and european , this is his nationality and culture . 
  genetically speaking though it is a different story . 
  it has nothing to do with race or the colour of his skin , it 's about his lineage . 
  asian populations are more lactose intolerant for instance while europeans are not , this is just genetics 101 . 
  people in thailand or vietnam do n't eat breakfast/lunch/dinner , it 's a very western habit . 
  they eat a lot more meals , just smaller . 
  where the hell did i say otherwise ? 
  saying that 75 % of the french jews survived is not mutually exclusive to the fact that a lot of french people collaborated to the atrocities joyfully . 
  i never denied that . 
  if you read my other comments in this thread you 'll see the polish guy started to copy & paste wikipedia articles about the horrors french collaborators perpetuated , like i was going to get mad about it . 
  i 'm not , i know what happened and i 'm not in denial like pretty much all the poles in this thread . 
  nope , you 're definitely corsairs !, 
  i 'll save your comment just for this part :  for your consideration though , throughout many years i 've read dozens of various historical books regarding the ww2 era written by authors from entire world , and i could draw the map of europe , including allegiances , current leaders , and at times even detailed troop movements after any significant front change throughout that period from the memory . 
  lol , but you did n't know most of france was an occupied territory . 
  you deserve gold !, 
   to the point , those are atrocities commited by the direct continuation of the legitimate pre-war french government . 
  in stark contrast , you 'll find no such event connected with groups affiliated with the pre-war polish government . 
  lol there is nothing stark about this , collaborators collaborated . 
  a lot less in france , which is something that drives you mad apparently   fighting on lowlands without heavy equipment , and while being outnumbered is n't exactly the easiest feat - but we still tried . 
  never said otherwise . 
  `` either '' was the word you should n't have missed . 
   and poland tried to oppose them , but it usually ended with 100 of polish civilians massacred by germans in retaliation to every german soldier killed . 
  question , in other occupied countries do you think resistance fighters killing german soldiers were given flowers by himmler himslef or [ their babies were crucified ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradour-sur-glane_massacre#history )  good , five years old is a good moment to start reading ...  i 'm glad you learned about existence of poland today . 
  must have been hard to quickly read as much as possible about it to have something to reply . 
  thank you for admitting your ignorance by not refuting my point . 
   if i wrote `` northwestern france ( including all atlantic coast to be exact ) '' , you would be butthurt that `` northwestern france suggests only a quarter of territory '' . 
  well , you can never please five year olds you attempt to discuss with . 
  northwestern is the north-west . 
  which is bretagne in france . 
  what you want to say is `` northern and western france '' . 
  add english lessons to the list because you badly need it . 
  but nice way to try to prove you were n't clueless !, 
   to sum up , after a bunch of poorly researched rambling you initially threw at me , i totally expected you to start throwing shit at me the moment it was clear you utterly lost this discussion - so your hillarious attempts at ad hominem left me completely unsurprised . 
  hope to discuss with you once again in a few years , when you 'll grow up . 
  * calls you constantly `` 5 year old '' * complains about ad hominem i think i 'll continue to challenge poles about wwii , it 's just too good to see you getting mad !, 
  i do n't think it is , i agree that it was a lot more cruel and violent for poland . 
  i was n't trying to compare just to say that it could be incredibly violent in western europe too . 
  [ we can understand . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oradour-sur-glane_massacre#history ), 
  i do n't know why you bothered to list atrocities committed by vichy and other collaborators . 
  i 'm not denying it and never did ... 
  if you have some free time , you can also get some nice copy/pasta about atrocities committed in french colonies , so i can tell you i 'm not denying it either !!, 
  so what i take from your butthurt reply is that either poles are just basically the poorest fighters and weakest people in europe , and by far . 
  germans could do what they wanted , built what they wanted and poles were just standing there crying in foetal position troughout the war . 
  but at the same time you 're telling me poles were fearsome resistant fighters , more than anybody else , no less !!, 
  so i 'll continue to read what objective historians say about poland in wwii , that includes the horror poles participated in and the polish resistant fighters . 
  in the real world , they 're not mutually exclusive but poles on reddit want so bad to create their own alternative history that it 's useless to talk about this with you . 
  also , i 'm glad that you learned most of france was an occupied territory . 
  must have been hard to quickly read as much as possible about it to have something to reply . 
  now you might want to take a few geography lessons or read more about it since you believe somehow it was only in northern france . 
  i mean , the map is pretty clear but apparently polish school programs do n't include wwii or geography so i 'll give you a pass . 
  or along alternative history you also have alternative cardinal points so bordeaux is in the north . 
  only explanation i can find . 
   poland is artifcally created as a monocultural country after ww2 . 
  agreed by both comunist and west . 
  so poland was not a country before ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
   jews were forced to leave poland after stalin 's death . 
  that was connected to power they had inside comunist party . 
  there were estimation that nearly ~ 50 % of nkvd were in fact jews from ussr and poland . 
  with propaganda from pzpr and approval from poles , jews were deported . 
  now we 're talking about the 1950 's ... [ 88 % of the polish jews were killed in wwii , ] ( http://www.annefrankguide.net/en-us/bronnenbank.asp?oid=20747 ) i was only refering to that and yes , they nearly totally disappeared . 
   i would like to see you in that scenario : `` guys i have great idea , german army that just beat us is building huge ghetto . 
  let 's just attack them with our fists , it will be great . '', 
  ak had barely any supplies from allies . 
  you should know that if you read any ww2 book . 
  same happened in france , but for some reason a lot less died . 
  a lot . 
  and i 'm still talking in percent of population . 
   are people in france aware about thier oppresive stance against jews for hundred of years ? 
  it might be hard for you but at least try to think about it , it wo n't hurt you . 
  yes , from 11 year-old to 18 we study antisemitism and how widespread it was until recently , with specific cases like what happened to captain dreyfus or of course what vichy and p\u00e9tain did . 
  and when someone like le pen makes an antisemitic remark he gets condemned . 
  that 's because we still have a strong jewish population with a voice , while yours is non-existent and being in denial is normal when [ only 3200 jews remained in a super-nationalist country . 
  ] ( https://imgur.com/bry1c8w ) look at this thread , you would never find an equivalent if the debate was about the treatment of jews in france during wwii . 
   poland also had the highest number of jews period . 
  i 'm talking in percent of population genius . 
  you take the trophy , do n't be modest . 
   ... and that was despite , rather than thanks to efforts of the french government in vichy . 
   because poland had by far the most jews in europe . 
  but you were also all heroes resisting and saving jews everywhere . 
  makes no sense , nazis could n't possibly operate and kill millions of jews in giant compounds in a country made up of heroes fighting them with only a very , very , very few collaborators . 
  impossible . 
   it would appear to me that doing such things on occupied territory would be even easier than in puppet states . 
  holy shit , do n't tell me you did n't know [ that most of france was an occupied territory ... ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/fichier:france_map_lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation-fr.svg ) man your ignorance is so cringy i would just quit reddit altogether if i were you .
