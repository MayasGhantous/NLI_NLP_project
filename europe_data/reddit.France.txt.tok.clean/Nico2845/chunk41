  why would they do that ? 
  i assume that would just be illegal , would n't it ? 
  besides , westminster would take a huge risk since eu nationals might very well vote for scottish independence hoping they would join the eu right after . 
   but let 's not forget why we have such a big population : because western countries discriminated them and hunted them when they settled near their towns and cities since they came in europe . 
  ah , romania the progressist who took so many persecuted romani in the middle age to shelter them while bloodthirsty western europe hunted them down , i must say i 've never heard that one before . 
  so if we leave this nationalist fantasy aside , romani came from india with the mongol invasion and they just settled more in the first european countries they reached . 
  once the mongols left , romani were taken as prisoners and slaves . 
  there is even a date for the very first one who got captured . 
   in combination with the mongol invasion of europe the first romani had reached the territory of present-day romania around the year 1241 . 
  at the beginning of the 14th century , when the mongols withdrew from eastern europe , the romani who were left were taken as prisoners and slaves . 
  according to documents signed by prince dan i the first captured romani in wallachia dates back to year 1385 . 
  edit : the source is [ dr. viorel achim who is a romanian scholar ] ( http://www.iini-minorities.ro/ro/membri/viorel-achim/cv ) who wrote a book about romani in romanian history . 
  he has a phd in history as you can see . 
  [ you can read the first 50 pages of his book there . 
  ] ( http://books.openedition.org/ceup/1549 ) if you have a better source i 'd like to read it . 
  he said `` a boost '' not that it 's going to get her elected , stop being blatantly dishonest . 
  and this is exactly what it gives her , [ she 's using the situation to her profit .

  reminds me of americans pouring french wines on the streets to protest our stand on the invasion of iraq . 
  it left a lot of people confused here , they paid for it , they were only wasting their own money ... 
  paris to cayenne ( the capital of french guiana ) is 7 107 km . 
  paris to st denis is 9 369 km . 
  so yes . 
  a planisphere is quite terrible to represent distance accurately . 
  you got it wrong again !, 
  dude you 're making million dollars movies called the hangover . 
  he did n't say he 's a programmer in the us , he said ** he is american . 
  the simple idea of uruguayans , argentinians and chileans uniting is just ... laughable . 
  hahaha i was wondering exactly that , very brevelant use of ` b ' then , i 'll bremember it . 
  question , did you add the ` b ' on purpose ? 
  did n't a lot of experts said that 2 years would be too short anyway to negociate an exit deal ? 
  what i read is most realistically if may triggers article 50 this month brexit would happen in 2020-2022 . 
   french , for example , has a huge amount of germanic loanwords yet it is still considered a romance language . 
  a huge amount ?? 
  i agree with the rest of your post , but this is total crap . 
  we have a very few words with germanic origins . 
  specifically , 550 from ancient germanic languages and 164 from german . 
  that 's out of a small dictionnary such as le petit larousse that has 35,000 words . 
  i do n't know where you got this idea , but i can say with certainty you do n't speak french at all . 
  fair enough , i got carried away a little bit but this argument that somehow we do n't spend enough considering how much we did in the past years annoys me so much . 
  and to be more accurate , when i meant the uk is a lot less active i meant in combat missions , not patrolling the falklands or training iraqi soldiers ( which are important missions but not comparable ) . 
  so when they mean ` managers ' , it can be a manager at mcdonald 's or a manager at apple basically . 
  does n't mean the stat is worthless , but it would be more interesting to compare managers within a company or at least within a specific sector .

  good, 
  fascinating , he just adressed your bullshit about the west supporting isis and reading your reply it seems he wrote an essay about how it 's good the west supports moderate rebels . 
   i myself lived in israel for many years and have many friends who moved to israel from france . 
  irrelevant personal opinion impossible to verify then , that 's what i thought . 
  and you blatantly ignored the rest of my reply , which is quite dishonest of you :  anyway , as i said , feelings \u2260 facts . 
  i provided you extensive data on why feeling safer in israel is just nonsense , terrorist attacks there are constant and more numerous for decades . 
  a jew has way more chances to get stabbed or attacked on a bus in jerusalem than paris , that 's just a fact unless you live in an alternative reality . 
  ca n't reply to that , so you pick and choose . 
   also your list contains solders . 
  so if i 'm an islamist and i go drive through a dozen soldiers in jerusalem and shoot them , i 'm not a terrorist ? 
  til . 
   so israel should just assume that all people return to their country of birth once they leave israel ? 
  yes , french jews move to israel because they can . 
  because they get citizenship/residency . 
  they 're moving back to france when they leave , because they can live there . 
  [ le monde article on it , ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2016/07/18/retour-en-france-apres-l-alya_4971214_3224.html ) with an estimate of 15 % to 30 % returning to france after their alya . 
  shame on us for being active in mali , centrafrica , syria and irak , patroling the sahel region and having the state of emergency at home ? 
  while the uk in the meantime reluctantly voted to assist in the fight against isis after the us and france put huge pressure on you . 
  france is currently 10 times more active than the uk , who spends massively to catch up and finally have an aircraft carrier ( years before it 's operational ) . 
  but yeah sure , shame on us for missing 0,2 % to meet a target we already commited to reach next year , [ when we 'll overspend russia 's military budget .

   you are talking nonsense . 
  if you ask a regular french israeli they will say that they feel much safer in israel . 
  how many did you survey ? 
  show me your extensive research on this please . 
  anyway , as i said , feelings \u2260 facts . 
  i provided you extensive data on why feeling safer in israel is just nonsense , terrorist attacks there are constant and more numerous for decades . 
  a jew has way more chances to get stabbed or attacked on a bus in jerusalem than paris , that 's just a fact unless you live in an alternative reality . 
   well where are they `` coming back '' to ? 
  how can israel keep record of where is ex-residents moved to ? 
  we 're talking about french jews moving to israel . 
  so coming back to france , where they were born and spent their life before moving to israel . 
  is it that complicated ? 
  and while israel ca n't keep a record of where specifically they are going , they have a record of the one who leave israel after they did their alya . 
  or do you think a country like israel does n't know who comes in and who leaves ? 
  really ? 
  well , france still remains safer than isra\u00ebl , [ you can just check the list of terrorist attacks of the past decades and see for yourself . 
  ] ( http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/comprehensive-listing-of-terrorism-victims-in-israel ) it does n't mean that france does n't have big problems , we very much do . 
  but claiming he moved to isra\u00ebl because he feels safer is just not based on facts . 
  for those who do n't want to bother to read the first link , [ according to the israel ministry of foreign affairs , for 2016 alone  ( http://mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/terrorism/palestinian/pages/wave-of-terror-october-2015.aspx )  there have been 169 stabbing attacks and 104 attempted stabbings ; 139 shootings ; 55 vehicular ( ramming ) attacks ; and one vehicle ( bus ) bombing and that 's not counting crime . 
  also , do n't forget that israel keeps updated data about how many jews from france are moving to israel . 
  curiously , one thing israel does n't display is the number of jews who come back from israel . 
  i did n't say that , but do n't complain when people believe it when the head of the fucking executive power claims loudly and publicly he 's gon na do everything it takes to block a candidate from winning a democratic presidential election . 
  because that 's literally what fascist dictators do by the way . 
  [ the president who said his ` ultimate duty ' is to prevent a le pen presidency then . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xsdy3/hollande_my_ultimate_duty_is_to_prevent_a_le_pen/ ) it 's like hollande is secretly working for her to give credit to her claims . 
  because p\u00e9 a corsica does n't have a presidential candidate , they 're only running for local elections . 
  that 's a strategical and important position . 
  for the last presidential election in 2012 , in corsica marine le pen finished the first round 2nd with nearly 25 % of the vote , ahead of fran\u00e7ois hollande . 
  regional elections ( the results of which are used for these maps ) are a very different thing there , corsicans voted for a local nationalist parti called p\u00e8 a corsica that got 35 % of the vote . 
  the fn scored only 9 % and finished at the 4th place . 
  so if you think these maps are an indicator of what corsica will vote next month , you could n't be further from the reality . 
  to put it simply , sephardi are jews who come from spain ( and spread in north africa and in the mediterranean region more broadly ) , ashkenazi are jews from central/eastern europe who came from the mediterranean as well but developped their own specific european culture/language .
