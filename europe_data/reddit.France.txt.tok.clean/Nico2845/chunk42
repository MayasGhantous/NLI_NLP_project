  for the name of your friend , eskenazi is a typical ashkenazi name . 
  [ there is a short wikipedia page that explains where the name comes from . 
  well , technically hollande as the president is the supreme chief of the army . 
  a general has to obey anything he says , which includes nuking le pen 's house if he wants to . 
  so his example is not that far off . 
  well , we 're the closest culturally speaking , latin countries are going to latin no surprise here, 
  you remember well indeed , it was the d\u00e9cret cr\u00e9mieux that granted them citizenship in 1870 . 
  that would mean they were counted i guess , especially since algeria was an integral part of france at the time . 
  still , there were a lot of jews in tunisia and morocco . 
  for example in tunisia they were 100 000 in 1948 and they are only 1500 today . 
  most of them left to france or isra\u00ebl . 
  same for morocco , they were hundreds of thousands in the early 20th century and only 2500 today . 
  [ u/account235 explained it pretty well . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xsdy3/hollande_my_ultimate_duty_is_to_prevent_a_le_pen/dekinao/ ) i would add the various scandals , the biggest being about cahuzac , minister of budget in charge of tackling tax evasion who ... had a secret account in switzerland . 
  and that was revealed less then a year after he took office . 
  a true genius . 
  the simple fact that this is the first time ever a president is not even running for a second term because he 's so hated says a lot . 
  yeah which one ? 
  come on man ... also , if they had something on macron they would have dropped the bomb by now . 
  41\u00a0520\u00a0000 inhabitants in 1933 , 64\u00a0859\u00a0599 in 20167 . 
  225 000 jews in 1933 , 475 000 in 2017 . 
  they more than doubled , so the jewish population grew significantly bigger than the general population . 
  there are two reasons basically . 
  first , france has seen `` only '' 26 % of its jewish population killed in wwii . 
  do n't get me wrong , this is a horrifying number of course [ but it 's one of the lowest . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_during_world_war_ii#history ) secondly , after the lost of our north african colonies a lot of jews migrated from there to france , with the climate becoming quite hostile for them . 
  which is why most french jews are sephardi , not ashkenazi . 
  to be expelled or persecuted in eastern europe as well after a couple of centuries of tolerance . 
  pretty much their history repeating itself forever . 
  absolutely , what a disgrace this man is . 
  taking a white knight stand after the worst term in history , seeing the fn basically doubling their voter base . 
  and now , in a month and a half , he 's gon na save france from le pen . 
  ` reached the bottom but keep digging ' as we say . 
  that pretty much seals it for the right , i do n't see how something else than macron vs le pen can happen on the 2nd round now . 
  outstanding performance i must say , fillon was the winner just 2 months ago . 
  he did n't just shoot himself in the foot , he nuked it . 
  what i heard from a friend who always knows everything about cars is that psa wants the technology opel developed for electric cars . 
  you 're joking right ? 
  the british and french empires were at their peak in 1920 , expanding like never before throughout the 19th century . 
  hell , we started our second colonial empire in 1815 . 
  [ this is a map of colonial empires in 1800 , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:colonial_empires_in_1800.svg ) not so long after you took your independence . 
  [ this is the same map for 1898 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:world_1898_empires_colonies_territory.png ) but be proud all you want my friend . 
   they actually abolished slavery and suppressed it worldwide . 
  no they did not , do you know anything about your civil war and the reasons behind it ? 
  the british were certainly the biggest contributor to the end of the slave trade and slavery ( which still exists today , not officially though ) , i give them that . 
  but they surely did n't suppress it in the american continent or across the french empire . 
  the british suppressed it in the british empire and a few other places , but it 's ridiculous to claim they did it worldwide . 
  edit : downvoted for pointing out a blatantly absurd historical fallacy ... reddit never ceases to amaze me . 
  and of course i just get downvotes and no replies . 
  lol . 
  i guess some prefer to boost their little nationalist egos rather than reading the truth . 
  if france decided to invade and colonise india tomorrow , do you think britain should keep quiet because of its colonial past there ? 
  also , i feel there is a difference between respectfully criticising a country for what it did and jumping on a random guy who happened to be from that country to blame all the past on him . 
  i see what you mean , but it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  there is not much to do , private companies give as much of their private money to their private employees . 
  it 's per capita , the uk has a large population . 
  are you saying you do n't have equal pay for equal work in sweden ? 
   if you say that only half of them stay , that 's 130,000 $ per person . 
  that 's not an amount of money that ca n't be made up by the taxes such a person pays here over several years . 
  that 's assuming 100 % of the taxes that person pays is funding universities and nothing else . 
  needless to explain why this is n't how it works . 
  at all . 
  largest \u2260 most powerful , that 's a pretty fucking huge difference . 
  no source or reference in your wikipedia article . 
   interesting that you can still praise trump in france . 
  you have to understand that fn voters do n't know who trump is and what he does . 
  to them , he 's the anti-immigration guy and that 's it . 
  they do n't read the ny times or follow what 's going on in the us , they were told he 's the anti-establishment incarnation and they do n't want to know more about it . 
  they 're just not interested . 
  wilders on the other hand is from the netherlands , the european country with the highest proficiency in english . 
  dutch people read and watch a lot more news in english and know who trump is . 
  no real difference , your attempt at sarcasm was just ... poor . 
   the fact is things like maternity leave and other benefits they pay to women cost more over the lifetime of employment so to balance the cost they need to pay women less . 
  but they do n't , or the difference is marginal . 
  [ for example in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_pay_gap#germany ) the wage gap between a man and woman equally qualified , with the same experience and of the same age is less than 2 % . 
  other western countries have similar numbers . 
  ok that 's ridiculous . 
  [ a light tunnel is already forming for her arrival !, 
  i agree the difference in the cost of life is n't that big , especially as you said considering the difference in salaries . 
  i was only talking about the price of cheap wine . 
   your salaries are twice what we have here which makes it more expensive to produce ... what employees cost has an effect on the final price of a product . 
   best wines in the world are ribera del duero , and my favourite french person agrees with me . 
  [ and how great he looks after spending years drinking them , ] ( http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/sites/default/files/assets/images/2014/04/houelle.jpg ) right ? 
   the crudo di parma or crudo san daniele , which are waaay more delicate . 
  funny , my ex is italian and everytime i went to see her family her mom would stuff my bag with food ( i lazily complained , actually salivating already ) . 
  there were different prosciutti and every single time she would show me the san daniele and say it 's `` moooooooooolto dolce '' , 
  i never said they did n't consider themselves culturally related to the peninsula , of course they were and still are . 
  i said they did n't consider themselves to be a part of it , it 's different . 
  a big part of france is culturally related to italy as well . 
   and in case you had n't noticed it 's not like they wanted to be part of the french nation-state , either . 
  i had noticed , no idea why you bring that up since it 's completely irrelevant in what we 're discussing . 
  but they never felt italian . 
  hell , as i said already they rebelled against genoa and proclaimed their independance . 
  that 's pretty clear they did n't and do n't want to be part of italy , the cultural and the nation-state ... 
  how would he disagree ? 
  he died decades before italy unified and went to the british to form an alliance , did you understand what i said ? 
  no idea what cremoa is . 
  [ best i could find on google . 
  ] ( http://packageimage.eng-mansy.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cremoa-sachet-250g.jpg ) italians united in a country in the late 19th century , corsica always opposed genoa which became part of italy and never expressed any desire to be part of this country .
