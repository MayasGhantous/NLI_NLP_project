  if corsicans are an italian ethnic ** ity ** ( i have to guess half of your words , i feel like i 'm talking to an 8 years old . 
  seriously . ), 
  then pretty much all of the people who speak a latin language are an italian ethnicity . 
  i think you 're confused . 
  they were never italian in the first place , they rebelled against the republic of genoa which did n't have the means to control them anymore and sold its claim on corsica to france . 
  they 're not desperate , they 're french communist militants fighting with kurdish communist militants against isis . 
  you make it sound like they joined a terrorist group while they 're actually fighting it . 
  for example , italian are going to say `` andiamo '' , if we pronounce the same word in french it 's just going to be `` andiamo '' . 
  in german , they 're going to say `` ich versteheuh '' for `` ich verstehe '' , we would say `` ich verste '' . 
  another example , most french people do n't know you do n't pronounce the noun `` record '' the same way you pronounce the verb `` to record '' . 
  the slight difference is not even taught in france , but it 's a major element of the english language . 
  it just does n't exist in french . 
   french people speak so fast that they seem to merge words together , which makes it hard to follow them ;  they seem to speak in a rather informal manner ( at least what i watched ) ; actually we do n't speak particularly faster than other languages , but the major thing with french is that we do n't have stress accents . 
  english , spanish or italian have them and it helps a lot to distinguish and separate words . 
  german does n't really have any , but they pronounce every letter in their words , so again it 's easier to identify words when you learn the language . 
  i had the chance to have a great english teacher who really emphasized that point , but most french people are clueless about this and speak english the same way they speak french . 
  ok , i 'm not inspired and i have a lot to do so you win this one . 
  [ come and get it , we 'll be waiting .

   ( also , tartiflette wins . 
  i do n't care who invented it . ), 
  that 's is french and you know it . 
  and you know that i know that you know it . 
  we all know . 
  admit it your favourite food is french, 
   the west treat china as if it 's going to be their slave-labor/ecological dumping ground provider forever . 
  really ? ... 
  because all i hear from the far left to the far right here is : `` the chinese are so strong they 're going to eat us alive !!, 
  we can not compete !! '' . 
  also , they 're not `` trying to raise a generation of engineers and finance-guys right now '' , it 's ridiculous . 
  they already have plenty of world-class engineers and shanghai and honk kong are competing with london and new york as financial centres . 
  they 're recognised as such for a while now . 
  i do n't know who you hang out with but i 've never heard people speak like that of china . 
  oh no they did not, 
   one example he used was a trip to the dentist . 
  a british density might say ` oh it 's not so good ' . 
  a swedish dentist will say ` this is very bad ' . 
  according to jim jefferies , [ that 's just because you have very low standards in the uk  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekvr9h7an8k ), 
  to be fair it 's fat tuesday for everybody else but you , it 's kind of confusing . 
  ah ok , sorry for misunderstanding you but i 've heard so many people saying muslims ca n't wear a headscarf or basically have to hide anything related to their religion in public that i get angry now . 
  to get back to your original message i was replying to , i agree with you then . 
  i think diplomats double-park everywhere . 
  shoud camel be the standard mean of transportation for diplomats worldwide ? 
  a question the un should definitely raise . 
   seems a bit hypocritical to be asking muslims not to wear headscarves in public places in france for fuck sake can people once and for all understand that there is only a law that bans religious symbols for public servant on duty and that 's all ?!, 
  and that 's all religious symbols , jews are not allowed to wear a kippah either . 
  no muslim is banned from wearing a hearscarf in public in france , stop with this islamist propaganda bullshit . 
  edit : misunderstood op , my bad . 
   yeah , slow growing , $ 173 millions to nato will not change anything to italian economy . 
  no it wo n't , because as he said , it 's a drop in the ocean for an over 2 trillion gdp . 
  well sorry but this definition is obviously terrible if eritrea scores higher than greece . 
  that 's just common sense and there is no need for an extensive study to see it 's flawed . 
  same here for france , we score pretty low in political culture while one of the thing we 're the most famous for is precisely this . 
  i mean , the country know around the world for its daily protests and strikes is on par with belarus ( lol ) and tanzania now . 
  oddly , we score high in civil liberties while they took a massive hit with the state of emergency . 
  only for the presidential election though , it drops for the others . 
  yes , around 80 % . 
  [ it 's cool bro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prd20robxpc ), 
  it looks more like an anti-piracy exercise . 
  why naples ? 
  [ we call this a napolitain . 
  ] ( http://www.recette-gateau.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gateau-napolitain1.jpg ) it 's has nothing to do with naples either if you wonder . 
  so it 's not as simple as he said ? 
  it 's a complicated issue and far from everybody agrees on it , thank you . 
   everyone and their mother has seen it , studied it , went through it - eu commission , governments , regional and national parliaments , ngos , civil , environment , work rights groups , lawyers , entrepreneurs , media blasting about it . 
  hell , it 's been published online for anyone to read and what about all these members of governments , regions and national parliaments , ngos , civil , environment , work rights groups , lawyers , entrepreneurs , media protesting it ? 
  saying it 's not clean ? 
  that 's what i used to believe . 
  until a study was conducted here in france about what people who did n't vote would have chosen at the last european elections , and the results just destroyed this preconceived idea : the results were pretty much the same , with the fn getting a slightly ** higher ** score . 
  but feel free to believe that people who do n't vote are enthusiastic european federalists and eu big fans if it makes you feel better . 
  [ here is the study for those interested ( it 's in french ) . 
  ] ( http://www.ifop.com/media/poll/2666-1-study_file.pdf ), 
  poland does its share , we ( the eu rich countries ) invested in them and it 's gon na pay back very soon , they 're doing great which was the goal . 
  poland is now a big economy in the eu . 
  i used to hold the same opinion regarding defence but with trump 's election they have totally legitimate concerns now . 
  and doubling their defence budget would n't change anything , we have their back because that 's the fucking point of having a union . 
  i hope they would have ours if needed . 
  but they do n't pretend to be a global power like us , they do n't have a permanent seat at the unsc , they 're not a nuclear power . 
  we ca n't pretend to be what we are without the responsabilities that come with it . 
  dude , the us just signed a new military-assistance deal with israel in september : [ $ 38 billion for the next decade . 
  ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/09/united-states-israel-memorandum-of-understanding-military-aid/500192/ ) and that 's 100 % for defence , nothing else . 
  poland gets a few tanks and soldiers for training from the us , how can you compare the two ? 
  and you ca n't compare that with the money invested by the eu in the polish economy , it 's completely meaningless . 
  the gut to say that ? 
  come on that 's the most mainstream opinion on colonisation you can express man ... not that he 's wrong , but what would take guts would be to say the contrary on algerian tv and make it out of the country alive !, 
  here you go sir , that 'll be 73 m $ . 
  cash or card ? 
  some , just some . 
  gib back tower eiffel now, 
  do n't know why you got downvoted , it 's a major source of conflict as you said . 
   they ( we ) simply have no connection to said territories nor the particular history between the state and the territory . 
  except something something space and where we launch our satellites from . 
  yes , we , europe . 
  haha , i noticed the `` 1/32rd cherokee part '' , i actually [ published a post on r/shitamericanssay about it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/4711bu/if_you_are_132_cherokee_and_your_grandfather_has/ ) just to be clear , no hatred on americans from me only friendly mocking . 
  i like this sub but sometimes it can be a bit hateful and quite anti-american which is not cool at all . 
  well yeah , they do n't have 1000 year-old castles but they do have their own unique history and culture . 
  i understand why someone would be interested in his ancestors ( who is n't ? 
  ) , but it 's weird to take so much pride in it and to make up a fantasy identity . 
  interesting , the fetish americans have for their ancestry is so weird from outside , it 's like a lot of them are cherry-picking to claim what they 're not .
