  nah , jmlp is the french politician who speaks the most elevated language , he knew perfectly what he was doing when he said this . 
  he played this stupid game his whole life . 
  it 's only chinese , labelling themselves as french is pure marketing . 
  well , to be fair alcatel was not the giant nokia was . 
   even though the uk is a more attractive target for islamist terror . 
  lol , nationalism gone absolutely mad : `` my country is the best !, 
  my country is more valuable to terrorists because we 're better than you !! '', 
  you mean the 21km long bangkok 's subway network consisting of one single line . 
  yeah that one . 
  and it 's a big one , i really do n't know why i 've never met anyone who could speak african fluently . 
  it must be a very hard language to learn . 
  plus richard gere is quite well known for being dumb as fuck , it 's like asking an idiot why he thinks this other guy is one . 
   i think that 's why the ~ ~ mods ~ ~ gods allow it sometimes . 
  ftfy, 
  this is what l'express said a few months ago , dhuicq is close to sarkozy :  `` emmanuel macron l' a fait dire \u00e0 nicolas sarkozy : les rumeurs sur sa vie priv\u00e9e qui courent dans paris , il en a identifi\u00e9 l'origine . 
  translation :  `` emmanuel macron made sure sarkozy got the message : he knows where the rumours on his private life come from . 
  he knows they come from a close friend of the former president . '', 
  oh it is a story , believe me . 
  it 's just not a detrimental one . 
  yeah , or [ b\u0153uf bourguignon with miso ramen .

  hahaha it 's ok mate , [ come here . 
  hawaiian pizza is from canada actually . 
  they knew the backlash that would come for such a hideous crime , so they named it after an american state so their neighbour would take the blame for it . 
  and it works apparently . 
  beware of the canadians , i 'm telling you . 
   there is nothing in my post that expresses negative feelings towards traditional family units . 
  it 's a common intentional fallacy brought up by people opposed to adoption by same-sex couples , somehow the plan is to destroy `` traditional '' families . 
  it was something i heard to many times when the same-sex marriage law was adopted in france , people convinced themselves that their children will be taken away by the state to be given to gay couples . 
  they did n't actually believe it , but since there is no logical argument against adoption by gay couples this is what they found . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande is openly atheist as well , it was never a question , just like milo\u0161 zeman the president of czech republic . 
  i 'm pretty sure scandinavian countries have mostly atheist leaders as well . 
  well i think we 'll see changes in the western policy of the region in the next years . 
  it already started with 9/11 , even if nothing was done technically against saudi arabia , americans realised that what they thought was their strongest ally in the me was actually a potential enemy . 
  the question is at what moment are we going to reach a point where the general public opinion in the us and europe will be so hostile that governments will have to avoid anything related to saudi arabia except of course calling for its fall . 
  i do n't know exactly about the uk , but i assume it 's not much different than france where saudi arabia is considered to be just like isis . 
  exactly , dropping saudi arabia has to be a collective decision of western weapon exporters , starting with the us . 
  what is worrying you in what he says about europe ? 
  oh for fuck sake when will you people understand our elections are absolutely nothing like the american presidential elections or a fucking `` yes or no '' referendum ? 
  funny yeah , i guess it is . 
  i love portuguese in france , best diaspora ever !, 
  interesting , now i know that belgium 1938 was producing as much as france in 1830 in millions of 1960 us dollars . 
  do n't know what to do with this information though . 
  i see , you 're talking more about how much of belgium was industrialised and when you said `` biggest industrial country '' i thought more about how much was produced in belgium . 
   before ww1 belgium was the 4th biggest industrial country of the world . 
  sorry but i have a really hard time believing belgium had a bigger industrial production than the us , the uk , france , germany , russia or japan to name a few . 
  nowhere does it say anything about mixing wine and coke , it 's about how coca-cola was inspired by vin mariani . 
  and it claims it without any reference . 
  it 's called panach\u00e9 in france and it 's widely popular as well , any bar will know what it is . 
  very nice after sports . 
  mmmmh not really , he was mixing wine and coca ** leaves ** , it 's like a wine with herbs and has pretty much nothing to do with mixing wine and a super-sugary soda . 
  kola nuts are what gives coca-cola its taste and they were absent . 
   lol , like if we wanted that . 
  in fact the fn is one of the party the most firmly against tafta . 
  funny how since trump got elected , some of his supporters got instantly a boner for le pen . 
  they do n't know much about her that 's for sure , because she and her daddy spent the past 20 years shitting on anything american , from food to politics to anything cultural that comes from the us . 
  but yeah , sure , she looooooves americans now !, 
  i see , it could very well be the reason indeed . 
  that was insightful , cheers !, 
   she did not express her personal opinion on it publicly . 
  there are rumours from credible journalists that she is in favour of brexit ( and that would not be surprising , given what we know about her ) . 
  interesting , i did n't know that . 
  any idea why she supposedly favoured brexit ? 
  the guardian article does n't say anything about it . 
   if she does not give her royal assent , we will have our biggest constitutional crisis since henry viii brexited from the catholic church ... oh no of course no doubt she would n't interfere , i did n't express myself clearly i meant `` apart from the obvious that she will follow the will etc. . . '', 
   cananada sorry but i laughed, 
   i reckon the queen will give her royal assent very quickly though !, 
  did the queen expressed her personal opinion on brexit ? 
  or just that she will follow the will of the people and the parliament ? 
  i 'm not qualify to contest their data , and i 'm quite surprised the european commission picked them for a report like this . 
  maybe journalists will get into it and reveal a scandal , who knows ? 
  they do look shady . 
  ok , you proved me wrong . 
  i spoke too fast and i 'll delete my message . 
  [ conspiracy theory incoming ], 
  i see you already turned yourself in , you should receive a light sentence then like 10 years in a penal colony . 
  [ copy & paste of an old comment you found for karma . 
  oh redditors ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5g3pjz/oh_no_its_that_graph_again_only_this_time_its/dapbfhd/ ), 
   in belgium the king signed a deal with saudi arabia to give them the exclusivitie of their imam . 
  he did n't do this at all , king baudouin offered them in 1969 the lease of a building where they set up the centre islamique et culturel de belgique , from which they spread their ideology to the whole country . 
  he hope he could get a good old oil contract in return . 
  [ here is a belgian source summarizing the spreading of wahabism in belgium . 
  ] ( http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/comment-l-arabie-saoudite-a-impose-son-islam-rigoriste-a-la-belgique/article-normal-55639.html ), 
  because it 's part of the untold deal our stupid successive governments passed with this cancer saudi arabia is : buy our stuff and we 'll close our eyes on your wahabi ideology you 're spreading and all the evil that comes with it . 
  no , you said it was `` quite a popular good luck symbol '' . 
  it was not . 
  none of your links show that the swastika was a popular symbol across europe . 
  are you seriously arguing that before the nazi 's rise the swastika was something familiar for the average pole ? 
  for the average french ? 
  for the average german ? 
  for the average latvian ? 
  that 's ludicrous , please . 
   which they denied the next day :  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/barclays-to-keep-global-hq-in-london-no-matter-outcome-of-brexit-a7547546.html the headline of your article :  ** barclays ** to keep global hq in london no matter outcome of brexit ** barclays ** . 
  not hsbc . 
  the 1000 workers to paris is still on the books ( although it 's really not a big deal and nothing major at all ) , and has nothing to do with a stupid rumour about barclays moving its hq to paris . 
  seriously , you could n't even read the headline before sharing it and complaining about the guardian being a joke ? 
   the truth is none of these banks want to relocate , its disruptive to business and carries its own risks . 
  instead they are making their complaints loud so that they might get a special ala ` nissian ' deal out of may . 
  the truth is these banks will absolutely have to relocate ** some ** of their activities in the eu if the uk loses its passporting rights . 
  because the fasces comes from roman time and had a long history in europe , the swastika was a complete new thing , buddhism being almost non-existent .
