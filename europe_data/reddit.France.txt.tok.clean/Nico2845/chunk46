  she hates more the judges who are trying to arrest polanski than him , it was over 30 years ago and she moved on . 
  no , for example a couple of years ago two french citizens ran over a girl in israel while they were on holiday . 
  they took the first plane back before the police could identify them . 
  israel made a request to extradite them , which france refused . 
  the family of the victim then pressed charges in france , and the two guys got a prison sentence .

  it was a nato exercise . 
  it was a `` secret '' exercise because no media was informed , that 's it . 
  til there is a brest in belarus too !, 
  stop/limit immigration , there is a big difference . 
  what 's ironic about this ? 
  what non-sense , federalists are definitely the best at ignoring trends and reality . 
  the last participation rate at the european elections in 2014 [ was a miserable 42,61 % . 
  ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/fr/turnout.html ) and that was europeans voting for politicians they knew , from parties they knew . 
  the front national came first in france , and all across europe anti-eu parties won big . 
  and your idea is that people will switch to vote for a pan-european party and even vote for a foreigner ? 
  that 's what you want to push right now ? 
  not consolidate what is already crumbling ? 
  i swear with plans like this no wonder the eu is struggling and people feel more and more disconnected to it . 
  some people in this sub should read stuff outside of it to realise how this kind of delusional idea is seen right now . 
  why did you make me do that . 
  they mispelled `` brussells sprouts '' . 
   cant speak for newer models , but for me , the french made cars where the window elevator stopped working after a couple of years , but the engine went on forever . 
  you pretty much summarized the problem with our cars : / great engines , terrible electronics . 
  mmmh there was never such talk , i think you 're mistaking with the russia -- nato council and the various cooperation projects put in place since 1991 ( and are suspended since the crimean invasion ) . 
  [ you can read more about it here .

  it 's also a romanian brand originally , it makes sense they have a strong presence in the region . 
  * nato offers membership to russia .

  never heard of this un 's arab human development report before , it 's quite interesting and they have [ their own website where you can `` mine the data '' as they say . 
  ] ( http://www.arab-hdr.org/ ) the way they 're doing it is very weird though , as you can see at the top of the front page they 're not publishing it every year and it 's never the same topic . 
  so , in 2002 it was `` opportunities '' , in 2003 `` knowledge '' , in 2004 `` freedom '' , in 2005 `` gender '' . 
  then , for some reason , they decided to take a 4 years holiday and published another one on `` human security '' in 2009 . 
  this one was probably extremely exhausting to produce because they decided to take a ** 7 years ** holiday before publishing `` youth '' in 2016 . 
  i see , fair enough then . 
  i get what you did , it 's just that imo comparing european countries which are quite often the most progressive in the world ( even a country like poland that is seen as conservative by some europeans is miles ahead compared to any african country for instance ) is not a very good indicator . 
  it 's a bit like comparing the gdp 10 % growth of a poor country with the 2 % of a super rich country . 
  mmmh yeah but on the other hand , pretty much any country in europe looks good compared to russia when it comes to tolerance towards homosexuality . 
  or tolerance of anything really . 
  no , that was for afghanistan , germany publicly opposed the iraq war since the beginning . 
  sometimes dumb comments like this get upvoted a bit and go unnoticed , but i 'm sure it 'll be downvoted a lot very soon , do n't worry . 
  very interesting , i 've never thought about it but it makes totally sense indeed . 
   sauce ? 
  i was negotiated and accepted when the uk entered the ecc . 
  it has n't become a `` toll '' , there is no such thing as a free lunch and it was clear from the beginning . 
  now some of you want to go back on this we 'll see what happens . 
   we ourselves do n't take advantage of it . 
  hundreds of thousands of british take advantage of it by living in spain , france , etc. . 
  but you take way more immigrants in , i 'll give you that . 
   so we 're letting in europeans who would not be allowed in if they were canadians , yet we 're not getting anything at all out of the reciprocal freedom ourselves . 
  no wonder we 'd prefer free movement of capital , goods and services without the free movement of labour . 
  for the common british worker there would be no loss in his own right to go abroad , for he was n't using it anyway !, 
  you take advantage of it by exporting goods , services , productions massively to these countries who have to accept it . 
  that 's how the ecc is built , richer countries with powerful companies have open access to the markets of `` poorer '' european countries . 
  you ca n't tell these `` poorer '' countries that they just have to accept these big businesses from western europe with which they mostly can not compete are taking over their markets while not accepting them to come and work where these companies are based . 
  that 's the deal . 
  i 'm not selling anything , his business would simply not exist at all if it was n't created by immigrants ( french in this case ) . 
  he just explained why they just gave up on hiring british employees because of their lack of a second language skills , and the lack of knowledge of a second possible market as a consequence which is a big problem for a company trying to expand internationally . 
  that 's a major reason why london is so powerfull financially , it attracts highly-qualified people and businesses from all over europe and the world who come with an understanding of both how the uk ( and the english-speaking world ) functions and their own country . 
  we 're not talking about a small shop that would hire only immigrants here . 
   so how can you expect such people to be glad of the right of freedom of movement within the eu ? 
  because europeans like u/barzuplo create companies in the uk and contribute massively to your system . 
  well , i think he meant the whole country as it 's pretty much exactly what the wikipedia article says ( found no other source ) :  in france over 100,000 german nationals residing in the french country ( the exact number is not known , some statistics indicate more than 300,000 germans in france but are not officially sanctioned . ), 
  there , the germans live mainly in the northeastern area of france , i.e. , in regions close to the franco-german border , and the sunny island of corsica . 
  german tourists are the most frequent visitors of france ( more than british tourists in france ) in the year 2013 . 
  and they mostly do n't live in paris region . 
  i 'm from paris , 100k even in the greater paris area is huge , that would have been noticed . 
   french knowledge in germany is far greater than german knowledge in france . 
  i lived 7 years in france . 
  maybe . 
  but to say that millions of germans are `` capable of reading le monde or liberation at ** native speed '' ** is you talking out of your ass , sorry . 
  i do n't believe it for a second and you do n't seem to have anything to back that up . 
   i think with french it 's different because it 's fairly standardized even in ex-colonies but comparing brazilian portuguese from minas gerais and portuguese from lisbon an outsider could think that they 're different languages . 
  what nonsense ... have you ever heard a guy from a farm in qu\u00e9bec next to a parisian speaking ? 
   there are about 100,000 germans living in paris what ? 
  nearly 5 % of paris population would be german , it would mean they have a full arrondissement ( district ) for themselves , where the hell did you get this number ? 
   add to that a few million germans capable of reading le monde or liberation at native speed what ? 
  ok sorry but that 's just plain bullshit , i think you grossly overestimate all of this . 
  that 's what you got from his post ? 
  really ? 
   a little bit of ipa does not hurt anyone . 
  [ it surely does n't , i could use some right now . 
  ah with an `` e '' . 
  `` hygg '' gave me completely different results than `` hygge '' . 
  still never heard of it , learned something today !, 
  nope i have n't , but just to be clear i did not mean to insult danish culture , just wanted to highlight how ludicrous this ranking is . 
  denmark 2nd in culture and the us , 53rd . 
  yup , totally legit . 
  all this danish culture flooding the world , who has n't noticed ? 
  just for context , it was taken in paris after the attacks of november 2015 . 
  people were invited to display a flag at their window in support of the victims and as you can see , some were quite creative . 
  [ more examples here . 
  anyone who knows a thing about military would tell you that the simple fact that you do n't have an operational carrier and wo n't be before 2020 at least is tragic for your power projection . 
  this is why it was such a hot topic in the uk for the past decade . 
  you could n't have a single jet fighter in the falklands right now if argentina decided to invade again . 
  you could n't lead a campaign in mali , while doing peacekeeping in centrafrica and while bombing isis in irak and syria .
