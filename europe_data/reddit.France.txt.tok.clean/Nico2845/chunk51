  so he does n't pay anything every month into the spanish healthcare system . 
  obviously spanish and other countries are going to charge the uk more . 
  that 's just a guess of course , i 'm not claiming anything , but what do you think ? 
  honest question , could it be that british in spain are mostly elderly who need a lot of care while spanish are mostly young people who do n't need it as much ? 
   we 're allowing christian fundamentalists to spearhead the charge . 
  do we ? 
  what have they achieved so far ( i mean since they started their comeback ) ? 
  i agree the fine is ridiculously low , but to say she `` stole '' $ 400m is also ridiculous . 
  you 're right , i should have written `` eu '' instead of `` european '' . 
  if a mod sees this and can modify the title he 's welcome to do so . 
   in addition , living in paris is quite expensive , providing a further obstacle to some entrepreneurs . 
  that 's the conclusion for paris . 
  so yeah , they take that in consideration . 
  it 's even worse for london , it 's a whole paragraph :  however , in other ways , london is a victim of its own success : attracting talent from the rest of the uk and overseas has pushed up housing and office rental costs . 
  west london now contains some of the most expensive real estate in the world . 
  competition between firms also means that salaries for talent , particularly with digital skills , are significantly higher than elsewhere . 
  oh ok , well the uk as a whole is a very business-friendly country and quite large with a big population ( for europe of course ) , so it did n't surprise me . 
  i think that was sarcasm ... 
  hey no problem !, 
  it 's an interactive map of the best cities for startups . 
  so for example , you can click on madrid and [ you 'll have this ] ( https://digitalcityindex.eu/city/18 ) , a detailed summary of its strength and weaknesses , etc. . 
   rt has got extra 1.22 billions rubles ( 18 millions euro ) to its budget to establish the french version . 
  the french version was established almost 2 years ago . 
  ironically links to rt are banned so i ca n't prove it directly , but anybody can google * `` rt en fran\u00e7ais '' * and see for himself . 
  [ here is their twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/rtenfrancais ) thanks for the 2 year-old breaking news . 
  totally agree !, 
  i actually found out this is how it works in france through a government campaign on the radio just last week !, 
  it was basically a conversation between 2 friends , going like this : `` are you an organ donor ? '', 
  `` no i 'm not '' `` oh so you signed an opt-out document '' `` no i did n't '' `` so you 're on organ donor then , everybody is unless you ask not to be '', 
  i 'm not communist at all and have very little sympathy for communism in general if that helps . 
  i just stated a fact . 
  the ussr , you mean the failed union where an elite called the nomenklatura kept almost all the wealth while the rest of the population was living poorly ? 
  yes , that 's a good example of how inequality can lead to collapse . 
  so let me get this straight . 
  * the us and saudi arabia fund isis and terrorists groups to overthrow el-assad . 
  * then the syrian army is fighting them , retaking the country . 
  * the us and 13 other countries try to bomb isis and other terrorists groups * `` to cover their failure '' * . 
  brilliant . 
  correct , 7 muslims or countries with a muslim majority , and 7 western countries . 
  does n't change my point though . 
  `` you lost 33 millions ? 
  [ what 's that , pocket money ? 
  '' ] ( https://laurencekt.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/trader-kerviel.jpeg?w=820&amp;h=615 ), 
   would you support police if it was breaking laws while catching criminals ? 
  please , give me this `` law '' you 're talking about the coalition is breaking . 
   the right way of going after isis in syria is with cooperation with syrian government . 
  the syrian government lead by bashar el-assad you mean ? 
  he 's very happy isis - who is trying to take over his country and has partly succeeded in case you missed - is getting bombed , do n't worry about that . 
   western countries bomb syria in violation of international law . 
  it seems international law only matters if it can be used to blame the russians . 
  saudi arabia , united arab emirates , morocco , jordan , bahrein , qatar and turkey are part of this western coalition . 
  7 arab countries , allied to 7 western nations . 
  the whole world , including putin and bashar , wants isis destroyed . 
  the violation of international law was made by isis , not this coalition . 
  literally everyone supports it . 
  that says it all . 
  ah ok , i see what you mean , makes sense . 
   because most countries do n't require people to report their wealth . 
  what ? 
  who ? 
  still cheaper than pretty much any other country at a similar level of development and wealth . 
  again , you need a reality check . 
   for 550 $ , you get like 20 m \u00b2 there that 's not crazy at all for a big city in the one of the world 's richest country . 
  you need a reality check . 
  same in france depending on your bank and the contract you have with them . 
  i do n't pay any fee anywhere in the world , but i have some friends who have to pay fees when they withdraw to a different bank than theirs even in france . 
  ignored and irrelevant , as always . 
  yeah , i read recently that the cdg is going to need maintenance soon , which means europe wo n't have a proper carrier for a while since the 2 british care wo n't be in service yet . 
  very interesting , thank you . 
  how does the charles de gaulle compare to both if i may ask ? 
  can they really be compared though ? 
  i mean in terms of capacity ? 
  nice . 
  yeah , you acknowledged its irrelevance first , then said it anyway . 
  so i thought you did n't really acknowledge it afterall . 
  do n't be mad bro , if you know it 's irrelevant , just give a break to your keyboard and move on to the next thread . 
  or do n't cry because people tell you what you already knew , 
  you mean i have to go through over 200 other comments before i can point out the irrelevance of your comment ? 
  it 'll still be irrelevant . 
  and when it 's a referendum the turnout is either the same in france or dramatically lower . 
  the last 3 : * maastricht , 1992 : 69,70 % * constitutional reform ( on the duration of the presidential mandate ) , 2000 : ** 30,19 % ** * european constitution , 2005 : 69,34 % no idea what you tried to prove by bringing up the turnout of the presidential elections in france , it 's completely irrelevant . 
   valls is likely to win the primaries , how so ? 
  he got a ridiculous 5,63 % at the last one in 2011 , and now he 's deeply hated by a lot of ps militants . 
  do n't underestimate her on that , most of her voters are from the working class , people in economic despair . 
  she is , economically speaking , very close to the extreme-left . 
  a lot of people who used to vote communist now vote for her . 
  you said :  but local population in europe compared to the world peaked in the middle of the 21th century long after european powers reached their cenith . 
  first of all , the middle of the 21th century is 2050 . 
  you 're either from the future or drunk . 
  second , your graph shows europe 's population peaked in 1900 . 
  ca n't you read your own source ? 
   when it already was losing in importance again . 
  how the fuck was europe losing in importance while france and britain ( among others ) were expending massively on every continent while starting the industrial revolution at home ? 
  care to explain that please ? 
   the population of europe really started growing in he beginning of the 19th century so a good two hundred years after europe started conquering the world and when it already was losing in importance again . 
  that 's the opposite , the british empire reached its peak precisely during this time . 
  between 1815 to 1914 , [ around 10,000,000 square miles ( 26,000,000 km2 ) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the british empire . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_empire#britain.27s_imperial_century_.281815.e2.80.931914.29 ) same for france . 
  algeria , vietnam , senegal , ivory coast , etc. . . all these countries were conquered when europe `` was losing importance again '' according to you . 
  even italy conquered countries and had colonies during this period for fuck sake .
