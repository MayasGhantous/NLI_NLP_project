  congratulations , you could n't get it more wrong . 
  what is his homophobic history ? 
  well she 's a nationalist , so her whole rethoric on leaving the eu is an important part of her `` program '' , but i 'd say her stance on immigration is what gets her the most votes . 
  to be fair i do n't think their respective positions on the eu will be the decisive factor in the election . 
  depends what left , socialist yes , but extreme-left is more anti-eu ( for different reasons than marine le pen though ) . 
  cut the funding of planned parenthood is marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen 's idea , not marine le pen . 
  she 's not against gay marriage , she did n't even go to the protests . 
  and where the hell did you see she wanted to repell the law on abortion ? 
  that 's pure bullshit . 
  i mean , [ 32,45 % of gay married couples vote fn ] ( http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/1505215-marine-le-pen-le-fn-et-l-homosexualite-un-double-visage-revelateur-d-un-parti-divise.html ) , the number 2 of the party ( philippot ) is gay . 
  i 'm not an fn supporter at all , but this kind of crap is what allow them to raise , they 're saying enough bullshit you can attack them on , stop inventing stuff . 
  he also said turkey does n't need the eu and that it should join the shanghai five . 
  honestly he just looks like an angry kid who did n't get his candy . 
  i disagree with some of them , have some heated debates with some of them , but i do n't dislike them because they 're english . 
  nothing more stupid than hating people because of where they 're from . 
  i do n't know about pensions so i ca n't speak about that . 
  [ here is an article explaining the eu law . 
  ] ( http://www.libreassurancemaladie.com/index.php?f=la_belle_histoire ) it 's how it happened in france but i think belgium did roughly the same . 
   in belgium we dont have that choice , you have to pay into the public system and you can get some additional private insurance but there is no option not paying into the public system you do have the choice , it 's eu law . 
  but belgium , just like france , ignores the eu and does everything it can to stop people from going private . 
  [ an article in french that explains it .

  british . 
   bad taste have you heard of bild ? 
  and that 's the best-selling newspaper in germany . 
  [ she was happy there too . 
  ] ( https://theslnaturist.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dbt1gdp.jpg ), 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9w1vo4ecoe you could get your info up-to-date 31 seconds in your video and it states the eu is turkey 's largest trading partner . 
  you do n't need your largest trading partner that is also 20 times larger than you economically speaking ? 
  sure . 
   http://www.yenisafak.com/en/economy/turkey-among-11-countries-cleared-of-imf-debt-2466274 oh so you were on the list with pakistan , iraq , ukraine or ivory coast and now your on the list with macedonia , romania , iceland or argentina . 
  man that 's impressive . 
  how could france , germany or the uk not be impressed by that . 
   latin american countries need plenty of money for travel costs in order to arrive in europe , thus they get visa-free travel because the chances of someone coming over and overstaying their welcome are slim . 
  completely ignoring the +1.5 million migrants who flooded europe the past 2 years , each of them spending between 5 000-10 000 $ to reach it . 
  money is not the reason at all why we do n't deliver visas easily to every country . 
  a flight from latin america to europe is easy to get at 400 $ . 
  i mean , depe ** n ** d ** s ** wh ** a ** t do you mean by keeping track ... 
  you 're so sweet , 
  you mean the `` french identity restored '' `` we 're all gauls and eat french fries '' that did n't even make it past the primary ? 
  i meant when he got elected in 2007 , i thought this was obvious . 
  do you remember anything about it ? 
  [ the ministry of immigration , integration and national identity he created does n't ring a bell ? 
  ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/minist%c3%a8re_de_l'immigration,_de_l'int%c3%a9gration,_de_l'identit%c3%a9_nationale_et_du_d%c3%a9veloppement_solidaire ) i mean , a fucking `` national identity '' ministry man ... sarkozy is so hated now what he 's saying does n't matter anymore . 
  but fillon and le pen , who most likely are going to be on the second round , talk a lot about `` french identity '' and it 's mostly why they will be in the second turn . 
   poor and unemployed people usually do n't vote for strong neo-liberals and people that are well-off usually do n't vote for socialists . 
  they do it all the time , that 's why we have the leaders we do in europe or the us . 
  otherwise the communist party or extreme-left parties would be huge and the choice would n't be between a millionaire like clinton and a billionaire like trump , and guys like sarkozy or berlusconi would have never been elected . 
  it has never been and never will . 
  at most people check if their taxes are gon na get higher with x candidate or go down with y candidate . 
  i mean , you think sarkozy was elected on an economic program or on a `` french identity restored '' program ? 
  same question for hollande , do you think people saw someone that put the economy back on tracks or someone who was just not sarkozy ? 
  most voters do n't know shit about economics . 
  at best they have a poor understanding of basic concepts like me , but that 's pretty much it . 
  but they will talk endlessly about societal topics like religion or security . 
  this election wo n't be much about economics . 
  i love my nokia . 
  at the last minute no , according to electoral results on the other hand all the fucking time . 
  for those who might not understand , fillon is called the `` french thatcher '' because of his program . 
  mmmmh ok seems like the article i based my opinion on was incomplete and you 're correct . 
  so adoption is not ban but gay couples will only have access to `` simple adoption '' which is not a full adoption . 
  i stand corrected and it 's a very dumb view imo . 
  good point you 're correct , he 's in favour of `` simple adoption '' by gay parents , meaning for example 2 dads can adopt a child , they will be the legal parents , but not recognised as the biological parents . 
  it 's still not a ban of adoption at all . 
   being anti gay adoption does n't exactly rank him in the same crazy tier as pis . 
  just to be precise , he 's not anti-gay adoption , he 's against assisted reproductive technology for gay couples and surrogate motherhood which is already illegal for straight couples . 
  regular adoption will still be legal for married gay couples , i do n't even know how that can be compared to pis . 
  well , i know actually , the word `` restreindre '' in the french article linked , which means `` restrains '' or `` limit '' , got translated to `` ban '' . 
  politico being politico . 
   reminds me of anti-french americans before the iraq invasion . 
  they dumped expensive wine into the gutters and wanted to rename french fries into freedom fries . 
  i really like the answer someone from our ambassy gave when asked what she thought about renaming french fries `` freedom fries '' . 
  after saying that french fries were from belgium anyway , she said :  we are at a very serious moment dealing with very serious issues , and we are not focusing on the name you give to potatoes . 
  this `` movement '' could n't look more childish and ridiculous after that . 
   kfc double down holy fuck that 's gross . 
  [ let me introduce you to this pizza hut monstrosity then . 
  ] ( http://www.thatsnerdalicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pizza-hut-cheeseburger-pizza-1.jpg ) can not be unseen . 
  oh good point i have n't thought about that one , i think home alone ** and ** dancing with wolves being released in 1990 explains the 1991 record . 
  kevin costner is responsible for that . 
  i 'm not even kidding , [ this graph shows it . 
  ] ( http://www.meilleursprenoms.com/stats/prenom.php3/kevin ) it 's basically the graph of kevin costner 's popularity . 
  i do n't see what sovereignty has to do with not allowing women to study but ok . 
  the fact is marie sk\u0142adowska-curie had to leave poland that she loved dearly to pursue her studies abroad because it was a backward country on that matter . 
  a genius that would have ended up being a maid if she had stayed . 
  blaming russia for it is quite ridiculous , unless you can find something on russia banning polish women to study certain fields and poles trying to actively change that . 
  but i doubt very much you 'll find anything on it . 
  i think you mean stupid poles who did n't allow women to study . 
  how do you take a rational decision then ? 
  i did n't say we were more corrupt than russia , i said we were more corrupt than what this map says . 
  problem with this kind of study is it 's only an indicator of `` basic '' corruption , like having to bribe the cops after getting pulled over . 
  but it does n't take into account the public servant who grants a public contract to his friend , or the lobbyist transfering money on the bank account of a politician in the bahamas . 
  we in western europe are much more corrupt than it appears on this map . 
  this conversation is very confusing . 
   yes you can not be tried if your country has not ratified the treaty . 
  this is definitly not ideal . 
  but how else do you want to do it ? 
  you can not force other countries to give up their juridical sovereignity . 
  of course , but the fact that a country like the us refused to sign the treaty and even passed a bill that allow them [ to fucking invade the netherlands if an american ends up being tried by the icc ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/08/03/us-hague-invasion-act-becomes-law ) does n't exactly entice third-world dictators to join it . 
  and as we see it , it 's a failure that 'll end up judging the next potential genocidal swedish dictator because only european democracies will be part of the treaty . 
  not sure they 'll have much work .
