  you ca n't be tried if you 're not part of it , and even the us do n't want to be part of it . 
  does n't it sound like a massive failure to you ? 
  well , someone had to start somewhere to create an entity like this . 
  it is clear now that this is a failure , but no international organisation would exist if no one believed in it and recognised it in the first place . 
  true but hollande does n't have the slightest chance to ever be on the second turn . 
  sarkozy , albeit with a lot of luck , might be . 
  makes you wonder why so many people were n't too fond of here . 
   and we 'll support europe in case of a russian invasion with a strongly worded letter , period . 
  fair is fair . 
   token support , we addressed this . 
  i 'll stick with the example i took for the sake of clarity . 
  so denmark , a nation 228 times smaller with a population smaller than most of your big cities sent 9.500 personel to afghanistan and you would support them back by sending a strongly worded letter ? 
  really shows how seriously you take alliances , indeed . 
   i 'm sick of europeans belittling thousand telling us we deserved 9/11 . 
  where the fuck did i say 9/11 was deserved . 
  victim complex is strong here . 
   no , they were more worried about their contracts with a murdering dictator . 
  these are not moral governments . 
  what contracts did germany and france had with irak in 2003 ? 
  we certainly did n't sell saddam the wmds you never found . 
   yeah , what will we do without denmark and it 's army . 
  yep , you really are serious about your allies . 
  continue to treat them well , it 'll pay back for sure . 
   this is all very odd ... you should be happy the nation you loathe so much is going to distance itself from you . 
  win win , you 're getting the mutli-polar world you always wanted and no more amerikkka making you their `` slaves . '', 
  what 's all the fuss about ? 
  oh i 'll be really glad to have some distance between americans like you and other trump voters who have no clue of the world and that it does n't revolve around them . 
  you can piss off in your shithole and die from diabetes or in one of your daily mass shooting for all i care . 
  i and other europeans will keep ties with all the other nice and intelligent americans who got off the internet a few times and understand a bit better what 's going on . 
   yeah , two of them . 
  the uk and france . 
  no one else in europe contributed anything of significance . 
  japan and others are happy to send token support . 
  they supported it , period . 
  denmark did n't send a million soldiers to afghanistan yet they supported it and sent troops and material . 
  say `` thank you '' to small countries that contributed and have some respect for the soldiers who died in this shithole because a plane crashed in a building in new york or just shut the fuck up . 
   yeah the us has os much influcen here , right germany and france ? 
  totally subservient . 
  you know who actively supported and participated in this illegal war ? 
  * the uk * australia * poland * south korea * italy * georgia * ukraine * holland * spain 7 out 9 are european nations . 
  what did i say already ? 
   pretty much all the support the us got in all their wars was from european nations sounds like i 'm damn fucking right . 
   this was a european operation you dragged us into . 
  poor little us who got dragged in the war . 
  glad to learn the us is a puppet of europe , having to bleed when their european masters decide . 
  you obviously opposed fiercely an intervention in libya , and sarkozy the giant threatened to spank obama . 
  then you had no choice . 
  poor , poor us . 
   the us get token european support and outright opposition . 
  the only opposition you got was from france and germany in 2003 , you get full support most of the time like all your stupid wars have shown . 
  you get no opposition , but your head is for far up your ass you do n't even realise 13 years later that the irak war was the mess germany and france warned you it would be . 
  when the `` token european support '' will be gone after the retarded president you elected ruined all diplomatic relations , you 'll realise that this is the only legit support you have in the world . 
   oh yeah , all that european support for us foreign policy . 
  pretty much all the support the us got in all their wars was from european nations , yes . 
  you might want to check where most of the non-american troops , material and diplomatic support came from in the gulf war , irak war , afghanistan war , libya or the current military operations against isis . 
  the us get massive european support , and we receive massive support from them in return . 
   did you not scroll down ? 
  as i said , it was literally the third sentence . 
  third sentence is :  the term ` great power ' emerged in the early nineteenth century to account for the leading european countries ; since then , a plethora of terms have been invented , such as ` major power ' , ` regional power ' , ` world power ' , ` global power ' , ` superpower ' and even ` hyperpower ' . 
  am i missing something ? 
   uh , yes . 
  as has the uk . 
  come on , be serious . 
  do you not recall the gulf wars , yugoslavia , afghanistan , libya ? 
  various peacekeeping missions . 
  anti-piracy efforts . 
  that 's my sentence :  this is why the uk has n't deployed since 1982 ** without the help of the us or , funny as it can be , france . 
  ** so i 'm completely correct , and i must say my suspicion of your lack of reading skills is growing . 
  the uk ca n't do shit on its own . 
  and it does n't . 
   it 's not my consideration , it 's the expert consideration . 
  it is globally agreed that the usa is the top military power , the uk second , and france the third . 
  the uk has been active in many military theatres alongside the french and americans , and they happen to pack a bigger punch and have more deployable forces than france . 
  are you arguing against this out of chauvinism , or do you really think that every think-tank is in a conspiracy to say france is militarily weaker than the uk ? 
  it 's not globally agreed , and you do n't have a single reliable source sustaining that . 
  i provided your articles of your ** own ** press , quoting your ** own ** royal navy . 
  you ca n't even tell me who are the people behind this bullshit website . 
   * embarrassment . 
  and it 's not . 
  the french are our allies . 
  we work with them since they 're the only other competent military in europe . 
  at that time , we were training pilots on the charles de gaulle while our new carriers were being built . 
  it 's not embarrassing , or humiliating , or any other synonym to train and work with your allies - especially since we 're both major players in nato . 
  what is embarrassing is that you think that france is a bigger military power than the uk despite all evidence to the contrary . 
  ca n't provide me with a counter example of french soldiers having to train on your carrier huh ? 
  that 's what i thought . 
  an aircraft carrier is what make a country a major military projection force . 
  ask any military expert and he will tell you the same . 
  as of now , you ca n't do shit without the us or other allies . 
  go check how the uk is projecting power in syria and irak right now but i 'm warning you , you 'll realise you ca n't do shit on your own . 
  and you have n't since 1982 , contrary to the french . 
   maybe try reading it ? 
  there was a big blue link to here at the top of the article . 
  it was literally the article 's third sentence . 
  where the hell do you read anything in your link that explains who european geostrategy is ? 
   and i said , it 's not about participation , but deployment capability . 
  france has strong regional power , it can fight in its region fairly well , but it lacks the uk capability to deploy globally in most geopolitical theatres . 
  no aircraft carrier , you ca n't deploy shit and this is why the uk has n't deployed since 1982 without the help of the us or , funny as it can be , france . 
  meanwhile , france deployed countlessly since 1982 . 
  everyone has recognised that france has been the dominant european military force for at least the past decade , including the us .
