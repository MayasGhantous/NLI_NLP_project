   again , not about what wars they have or are fighting in , but about military capability . 
  france and the uk are active in most wars together , and have missions all over the world , but the uk is more capable . 
  that 's a fact , not an opinion . 
  `` the uk is the benchmark of europe for expeditionary forces , '' bastian giegerich of the international institute for strategic studies . 
  still not a single example of the uk deploying without the us since 1982 ? 
  you 're delusional mate . 
  your military command has n't been in charge of leading a conflict in 34 years and you consider the uk a global power and france a regional one ? 
  it 's almost sad . 
   you mean , whilst two old friends and allies were training together , they spoke the same language ? 
  and because it was on a french carrier , they learnt french ? 
  that 's neither surprising nor humiliating , and nor does it mean that the french military is better , or has better power projection . 
  these are facts based on independent think-tanks and sources , not opinions rooted in patriotism . 
  i 'll just quote the article since apparently you ca n't read :  one senior royal navy officer said : `` who would have thought that more than 200 years after the battle of trafalgar , ** we would be asking the french to train our naval fighter pilots ? 
  ** that 's an ambarrassment lol . 
   well , they are . 
  independent sources repeatedly state this , that the usa is the world 's sole superpower , the uk the only global power , and france the top regional power ( out of eight ) . 
  source here . 
  the only information about your `` source '' is :  website built by eggcup web design in norwich , united kingdom that 's it . 
  so spare me your crap please . 
  no independent sources repeatedly state this , even [ your conservative press recognises the uk lags behind . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/12013359/france-is-now-a-bigger-player-on-the-world-stage-than-britain.html )  it 's not a question of who started the most wars , but of equipment , training , and deployment abilities . 
  in the past year alone , the french army was bombing isis in syria and irak , deployed in the sahel region for security missions , managed to prevent a genocide in centrafrica and was also in mali all under the state of emergency with thousands troops deployed home . 
  meanwhile , the uk reluctantly joined the coalition in syria . 
  and if we look at the past 30 years , it 's frankly embarassing to see the british army doing nothing but follow , including under french leadership in libya . 
  the biggest laugh was a few years ago when [ royal navy pilots were forced to learn french ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8570983/royal-navy-pilots-forced-to-learn-french.html ) to be able to train , because the royal navy has virtually no projection power and has to wait years again before having an aircraft carrier again . 
  global power my ass lol, 
   that 'd reflect well on the uk and france ( a global and regional power respectively ) you think the uk is a global power and france a regional ? ... 
  you should look at a world 's map to check where both militaries have been active for the past 10 years , and check as well which pilots had to learn the other country 's language to fly on the aircraft carrier their army does n't have . 
  i do n't recall a single military conflict lead by the uk since 1982 , but sure , you 're the global power . 
   cant argue with americans calling us freeloaders while they miss out on lower taxes or extra social security to pay for our security what a load of bullshit . 
  romania has almost twice the population of belgium for 1/3rd of its gdp . 
  stop being an ass like u/nonamenoglory said and try to understand what you 're comparing . 
  i have a hard time believing this ranking . 
  shenzen or macau before nyc ? 
  just to be clear , i 'm sincerely ready to accept i was wrong if you have something else , i do n't pretend to have the ultimate truth . 
   the support in the uk was much lower than yougov 's pointing out ( except they cite their own polls ) . 
  yougov is a pretty reliable source , and you have none to contradict their data . 
  except your own feeling about this , or what you think you remember of it , you have given me nothing so far . 
  so , your graph says the uk was the european that opposed the least the conflict . 
  interesting way to argue against my point . 
  now if you have data contradicting the yougov 's one , i do n't see the point of discussing this any further : the british were a majority to support the irak war in 2003 , that 's all i pointed out . 
  you 're discussing the reason behind the support , not the support itself . 
  you were wrong on that last point , i just pointed that out . 
  it 's a massive support compared to other european countries . 
  in comparison , [ 80 % of the french were ** against ** the war at the same time . 
  ] ( http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2003/03/26/288662-irak-80-francais-disent-non-guerre-amerique.html ) but anyway , you argued that `` most '' of the uk was very much against the second gulf war . 
  that is wrong , and a majority of the uk was in favour of it . 
   the uk as well . 
  [ you remember wrong , like most brits . 
  ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/03/remembering-iraq/ )  though it has been controversial for over a decade , the invasion was actually popular at the time . 
  in 2003 , yougov conducted 21 polls from march to december asking british people whether they thought the decision by the us and the uk to go to war was right or wrong , and on average 54 % said it was right . 
   but more than 10 years of opposition is a long time , and many people now remember things differently . 
  now only 37 % of the public say they believed military action against saddam hussein was right at the time , instead of the 54 % recorded at the time . 
  i read [ `` dumpling '' ... ] ( http://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2015-01/dumplings_625x350_81421835686.jpg ), 
  it 's still the typical shit you find on r/shitamericanssay . 
  i guess we need r/shitamericansandeuropeanssay now . 
  i 'd say the suez crisis was the moment britain and france realised they were no longer superpowers , but it had effectively happened 11 years before . 
  r/shitamericanssay at its finest . 
  no shit . 
   the nordic model does n't count as socialist because it 's successful and it hurts the narrative . 
  what narrative ? 
  except conservatives in the us , nordic countries are almost constantly pointed at the model other countries should follow . 
  and the nordic model is not socialist , have a strong social safety net and social security does n't make it less a capitalist model . 
   when socialism does n't work out , it 's because of bad implementation unbelievable to still read this in 2017 . 
  `` my doctrine has no flaws and it 's perfect , only bad people make it a constant failure '' . 
  let 's just remove all critical thinking , after all this is what fascists and many socialists ( fortunately not all ) have in common . 
  britons rather than british people would be more accurate but you 're right . 
  what the hell are you talking about , french troops were fighting to cover the british escape and p\u00e9tain signed the armistice more than 3 weeks after the last british soldier left northern france . 
  you need to read some history books because your head is full of nonsense . 
  the channel protected britain for the past millennium , it 's an accepted fact . 
  that does n't take away the qualities of the british army but it was the decisive factor that allowed britain to retreat , recover and have a plan with allies and ultimately defeat germany . 
  period . 
  so now you 're imaginating what if britain was not an island blah blah blah . 
  all that because you do n't like the fact that the channel is the reason it did n't get invaded . 
  it 's not even a debated fact , and it 's not shameful or anything . 
  i really do n't get why you get upset about it . 
  your largest navy is pretty useless if you have a land border with germany . 
  which is why the channel is the fucking key and the reason britain was capable to keep on fighting . 
  i 'm not saying he was right , we all know p\u00e9tain was wrong . 
  i 'm saying this is not a stretch to understand his reasoning , at the time britain was the country who got crushed like the others when facing germany and only got saved miraculously a the channel . 
  yeah , it 's more like : ` france is lost , so surely britain and its soldiers who are still desperately swimming back home after getting wrecked like us , having to rely on fishermen to evacuate , and its bff america wanting to stay neutral and make as much money as possible out of the war , will soon fall too ! ', 
  does n't seem that stretched . 
   and transporting stuff by sea is energy efficient , as the ocean currents carry you along if you are a skilled mariner . 
  that 's the biggest bullshit i 've read on reddit today . 
  to give an idea , the 15 largest ships in the world pollute more than all the cars in the world combined . 
  yes , i repeat : ** all the cars in the world combined ** . 
  the only good thing about transporting stuff by sea is that it 's cheap . 
  that 's it . 
  it 's ok you have other qualities my friend , 
  `` and a german comes in and ruins the joke '', 
  it 's not just a common colour , it 's the colour you 'll see the most in buddhist temples mostly worn by monks . 
  he is trolling , i do n't see another explanation . 
  hahahaha very funny , i 'll have you know i used soap just a couple years ago for christmas , so you can quit with your bad stereotypical old joke !, 
   usually , you need more and more as your usual is n't satisfying anymore . 
  you do n't even see the irony of your point in this debate , do you ? 
   what i was talking about is the massive illegal import of sex slaves who are used for porno against their will . 
  what did you get that from ? 
  for prostitution sure , but most porn i end up watching is definitely not some slaves brought from third world countries but girls from texas or florida . 
  agreed , hopefully they 'll have to rethink the whole organisation to a more realistic and viable model . 
  boston , hamburg , toronto , budapest and rome were all candidates but withdrew .
