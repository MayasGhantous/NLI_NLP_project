  irrelevant , ukraine is neither in nato or the eu and was an isolated country on its own . 
  there is absolutely no comparison with full members of both the eu and nato . 
  none . 
   quick reminder that they 're barely trying in donbass . 
  there 's estimated to be roughly 5000 russian forces in donbass . 
  in comparision russian snap military exercises next to estonia , typically include over 100,000 troops , and are launched with virtually zero notice . 
  gdp is also 100 % meaningless when they already have the military hardware they need , and have tens of thousands of pieces of more hardware in reserves , just waiting . 
  irrelevant again , you do n't need to be a five-star general to know russia can invade estonia . 
  the nato deterrence is what comes after they do it , which makes it unworthy since they would get destroyed . 
  if nato or the eu simply lets a country fall to russia , there would be no eu or nato anymore . 
  russia mostly depends on the eu for their revenues from gas , why the fuck would they attack their biggest client for literally almost no gain ? 
  what is so incredible in the baltic states or eastern europe for russia to shoot itself in the foot by attacking them ? 
   economic aid , and simply because it serves the eu 's interest . 
  a stronger economy in those nations , means the eu has a stronger economy , and the euro 's value can rise . 
  do n't act like it 's for any purpose other than that ... 
  it 's a mutually beneficial union , of course we 're not giving money away for nothing . 
   and we 're back to that poll , and the overwhelming view of western europeans as a whole that they can go fuck themselves if they 're invaded , asking olga , cashier at aldi in dusseld\u00f6rf during the most peaceful time of german history what should we do when wwiii breaks out is the dumbest study you could produce . 
  if you think this is what matters when the decision comes ( again , after certainly years of violent escalation between russia and europe ) you 're just plain stupid . 
   on top of witnessing germany openly engaging in appeasement of russia for doing to ukraine exactly what it nearly monthly threatens to do to them . 
  because we rely on russia for energy , genius . 
  it 's a practical necessity . 
  the same way eastern europe has been relying for 20 years on western europe or it would still be the shithole it was in the early 1990s . 
  general opinion question like this in a peaceful period makes no sense whatsoever , do you think that people would have responded overwhelmingly `` should '' if the question was asked to french people about mali before the war broke there ? 
  we 're talking about a potential invasion of russia of a nato member , that means wwiii with nuclear powers , a war that could potentially annihilate the entire planet , do you really think people grasp what it means ? 
  do you think they would be in the same state of mind than in spring 2015 when the study was conducted ? 
  when they were planning their summer holiday ? 
  it 's absolutely ridiculous to evaluate the support they would receive based on that . 
  for russia to invade nato ( something it did n't even dare trying when the ussr was a lot more powerful than russia is now , quick reminder they ca n't even succeed in dombass and have a gdp smaller than italy 's ... ) , there would be an escalation that would take years and would reach a peak unseen even during the cold war . 
  should i remind you also how reluctant the public opinion was in the us for wwi and wwii ? 
  yet the us was one of the major force in wwii and liberated western europe . 
   you 're viewing them ( in their eyes , and my independent eyes ) as sacrificial lamb , not allies . 
  what . 
  the . 
  poland is the country that receive the most funds , eastern european states are getting 170 billion from 2014 to 2020 alone in eu funds to develop economic sectors and build infrastructures , they are part of the largest military alliance ever created and are guaranteed protection by nato and the eu , and we view them as sacrificial lambs ?? 
  honestly i keep reading german talking about it but i 'm extremely sceptical . 
  one journalist from der spiegel claims sarkozy out of nowhere offered that in a meeting with merkel . 
  not a single official source , german or french , has ever confirmed it happened . 
  sarkozy never expressed this publicly . 
  it was never in his program , he never mentioned it unofficially to journalists . 
  so , most likely no , it did n't happen . 
  should have written in full letters i guess , i meant eastern europeans by ee , as people not countries . 
  the guy i originally replied to is an example of that . 
  [ here is another reply from him that will make clear what i mean . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6jjrmm/the_eu_would_save_20_billionyear_if_it_had_a/djeti1g/ ), 
  i think you misinterpreted what i said , i 'm not claiming that we can always offer a similar/better option than the us in every field and that ee should always choose our weapons . 
  i was talking about some ee who constantly dismiss whats comes from we . 
  also , your beautiful f35 are certainly ahead of what any we country is producing , and they 're also certainly not getting bought anytime soon by any ee countries . 
  we 're not talking about armies that buy your last technological wonder here . 
  pretty much everything you produce , from food products to precision parts . 
  who do you think you export it to ? 
  oh i understand that and as you say there are legit geopolitical aims in these deals , i was talking specifically about ee who by principle refuse to hear anything from western european countries and have this `` screw you '' mentality . 
  you can see from the other replies he posted that op falls in this category . 
  russia , a country with a gdp smaller than italy 's and falling , is not going to invade a full eu and nato member . 
  they have nowhere near the capacity to do it . 
  i can listen to the concerns of some countries like estonia who have a significant russian minority , but poland ? 
  it 's just plain ridiculous . 
  poland is basically a kid with a bowl full of ice cream . 
  he has n't even eaten it yet but he 's already crying for a second bowl . 
  and of course he does n't want to pay for it . 
   it 's hard to consider germany our most reliable ally when they 've been blocking permanent nato bases in poland for decades everybody is blocking the bases including the us because no wants to pay for that . 
  because you wo n't , of course . 
  and it 's useless , according to everybody but poland . 
   ** the us and germany have unequivocally said that nato will not build new bases in poland ** , citing tactical and political reasons . 
   ** `` nato 's not talking about establishing bases ** ... we support an enhanced presence , but we can do it without bases , bases , bases , '' james townsend , ** a senior pentagon official ** , said in bratislava on friday ( 15 april ) . 
   ** petr pavel , a czech general and a senior nato official , said new bases might ** act as a `` political deterrent '' but ** have little value in tactical terms . 
  ** [ source ] ( https://euobserver.com/foreign/133084 )  they stab our backs endangering our economic security by signing the nord stream deals with russia . 
  economic security guaranteed mostly by germoney , which you do n't seem to realise . 
  but you should leave the eu and make an alliance with the us , i 'm sure they 'll give you all the work visas you want and billions in subsidies every year . 
  what are you waiting for ? 
  so you consider the us to be your closest ally , not germany or other eu members ? 
  then people wonder why we have so many troubles ... 
  right , so besides the fact that saying the west has its economy based on eastern labour imposed through a forced policy is quite a stretch , you understand that it 's better to buy from the us ( also a western country , richer than france and germany combined by the way ) , a non-eu country that does n't contribute to all these sweet eu funds ? 
  tell me , where exactly these countries like slovakia that are net recipient think this money comes from ? 
   russia and the us are making the best quality products when it comes to weapons/military equipment . 
  do n't even try to compare some german toys with these two rivals . 
  flagged you as `` troll '' , will save me some time in the future . 
  i 'm not denying the quality of american weapons , or saying there are not plenty of totally legitimate reasons to go with their offers , i 'm just questioning the systematic refusal by some eastern europeans to even consider western european offers . 
  just look at what the guy i was responding to said , talking about french and german `` scrap '' . 
  countries all around the world buy for billions of our weapons , we create some of the most advanced technology but a guy from slovakia will not tolerate to have such low quality for its 23 soldiers and 3 pilots that constitute their army . 
  i 'm always puzzled by eastern europeans who just openly turn their nose up at the idea of buying western european weapons . 
  but american ? 
  fuck yeah , screw you germoney , france , italy or spain !!, 
  hahaha !!, 
  what 's exactly the win in this ? 
   it became identified as an english foodstuff . 
  not by anyone else but themselves ... 
  to be honest if we 're 2nd for postal services i ca n't even imagine what the others apart from switzerland have to go through ... 
  last info ( france inter at 5pm ) : apparently he miserably failed and only killed himself without injuring anybody . 
  there was a gun in his car . 
  pathetic all the way . 
  spain/italy produce cars  japanese cars become cheaper when tariffs get lower  car producers close down factories or lower the production in spain/italy because of the harsher competition from japn  spain/italy lose jobs and taxe revenues . 
  it 's not that complicated . 
  getting a student visa for a canadian is rather easy , especially since a lot more french students go to canada than the other way around . 
  wtf is that . 
  if you think the army would pick an assault rifle that will equip tens of thousands of soldiers in extreme combat situation all around the world for the next 3 decades based on `` european unity '' and not quality sorry but you 're just plain stupid . 
  not to mention the inevitable leaks and soldiers anonymously complaining that there was a better choice possible . 
   they are using programs like these to push for european unity , lets not kid ourselves . 
  what ? 
  no , we know since 2001 ( when the manufacturer of the famas definitely closed ) that the new weapon would come from abroad . 
  yeah same in france .
