  i mean a lot are available but months or a year after . 
  with the exception of a few big tv shows like got or house of cards ... for which i would need to subscribe to 2 different cable channels . 
  no thanks . 
  but, 
  yeah but dutch is not a real language , that i know . 
  waterdogs are real . 
  stop trying to hide the truth . 
  sounds weird but ok . 
  of course there is , everybody knows [ that cow-plants are real . 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/bd/b1/c4/bdb1c4d412a730f1d7d9e3f01b4dbeb2.jpg ) the mainstream media caught lying again !, 
  but it 's a judge that has to decide this , right ? 
  i know in france only a judge can order the deportation of someone that can make his case , i do n't see how this is n't a fair trial . 
  considering our legal systems are very close , is it possible for someone else than a judge to deport someone ? 
   it 's been a while since countries have kind of removed the right to a fair trial in case of suspected terrorists : the us does it , i think france does it , italy does it too and i would imagine the uk already does that as well . 
  i kind of see with the us that found a parade with guantanamo , but i do n't see for the others . 
  last time i checked , may is just a pm with no power anymore and i fail to see how she can suddenly remove the right to a fair trial in the country like the fucking united kingdom . 
  seriously , did all the legal tradition and individual freedoms suddenly became something irrelevant in the uk ? 
  do you think such things can be implemented like this , with no opposition in a country with institutions that proved to be so strong and stable ? 
  yeah , it 's ridiculous and makes it seem like the uk would be a rogue state with slave masters ruling the country ( seriously , claiming the echr is what guaranteed british citizens to remain free from slavery ... it 's actually insulting considering the brits were the driving force to abolish slavery as you point out ) , occasionally beating up their wives and burning immigrants as they please . 
  it 's like the british ( or any country that is part of the echr convention ) have absolutely no legal system , moral or ethics and thank god the echr is there to keep them in check . 
  nothing happened before 1953 , we were all savages living in caves . 
  and before someone tells me that may claims she wants to change human rights laws to deport and track down terrorists , this is a debatable position but still something she would have to change democratically . 
  because the uk is a democracy and taking a hardline position on terrorism during a political campaign does n't suddenly make the uk a dictatorship . 
  what do you mean by `` the rest '' then ? 
  because the 5-6 bombs you just built are basically useless and you have no plutonium . 
   we have enough plutonium to build 5-6 bombs right now . 
  the rest is easy . 
  it 's the opposite , building basic nuclear bombs is easy , the rest is complicated . 
  it would take decades for poland to develop a successful nuclear missile program on its own . 
  indeed , there is more and more cooperation between france and germany for defence r&d . 
  fair enough , this is indeed a pointless conversation in this case . 
   to be precisely some companys work with the french to build theres ... ... do you have a source for that ? 
  good idea , there are still a few parts of italy to annex . 
   they do n't issue money they actually do , it 's the modern gold dinar . 
  but the us dollar is the currency they mostly use . 
  like cambodia . 
  is cambodia ruled by a guerilla group ? 
   have an economy which works from the few things the syrian govt had left right , so they should have abandoned the lucrative oil and cotton fields because r/improb does n't consider anything that is n't built from scratch as a real economy . 
  great argument . 
  so to end this conversation , i 'm just gon na quote this reuters ( serious enough for you ? ), 
  [ article ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-raqqa-insight-iduskbn0gz0d120140904 ) :  the group famous for its beheadings , crucifixions and mass executions ** provides electricity and water , pays salaries , controls traffic , and runs nearly everything from bakeries and banks to schools , courts and mosques . 
  **  while its merciless battlefield tactics and its imposition of its austere vision of islamic law have won the group headlines , ** residents say much of its power lies in its efficient and often deeply pragmatic ability to govern . 
  **  `` let us be honest , ** they are doing massive institutional work . 
  it is impressive , ** '' one activist from raqqa who now lives in a border town in turkey told reuters . 
  that was 3 years ago , and they are still up and running precisely because they 're not just a guerilla group , they are much , much more than this . 
  yeah that 's the thing , the vatican recognises the evolution theory as valid . 
  only mental evangelists in the us or brazil are creationists . 
  mauritania , sudan , saudi arabia , yemen , iraq , iran , afghanistan , pakistan . 
  these are the countries where ** sharia applies in full ** , covering personal status issues as well as criminal proceedings . 
  that concerns 440 million people , almost a third of the global muslim population . 
  then you have other countries where sharia applies in personal status issues or with regional variations in the application of sharia . 
  so that 's who follow sharia law . 
  no , no and no . 
  isis is absolutely unique in the sense that they actually administrate the land they conquer . 
  they pay salaries to public servants . 
  they collect taxes . 
  they maintain infrastructure . 
  they have courthouses with judges , police patrolling the street . 
  they distribute subsidies . 
  they have a long-term economic strategy . 
  saying this is just a guerilla group is non-sense . 
  `` apart from the potential privacy issues '' ok ... 
  right , in the uk it seems to be quite crazy . 
  i do n't understand how people can browse the internet without at least a vpn so i guess i do n't fall in the `` everybody '' category . 
  it was shut down briefly , but it 's still up and running , i 'm using it daily . 
  you can torrent it , i can send you links in mp if you want but it 's pretty easy to find . 
  \u00c4kta m\u00e4nniskor looks fucking interesting man !, 
  for le bureau des l\u00e9gendes , season 3 just aired in france and a 4th is coming . 
  i 'll be happy to give you links though i do n't have swedish subs though, 
  well i 'm not a big fan of sloppy tv shows that 's all , and everything else is welcome . 
  i 'll look up your stuff man !, 
  thanks for the support , but do n't you have a great swedish tv series to share ? 
  you have great books who at the end up make great films , i 'm sure you have some !, 
  also i 'm curious , how did you end up watching le bureau des l\u00e9gendes ? 
  help me out then , what is your favourite tv series from catalonia/spain ? 
  i do n't know , i 'm a r/europe guy ... and rather than having a lot of `` series of europe '' posts , is n't it better to have all in one thread ? 
   you 're just obsessed with your idea then  it will be a integrated military organisation constructed of multiple partner countries in the eu under the pesco framework it 's seems like you took the final decision . 
   and having army parts that focus on trainings and support missions and others on combat missions is n't unthinkable as you tried to claim , because clearly its happening right now . 
  yes , that 's what is happening within a military ** alliance ** , where the benefits and influence of being part of are vastly different . 
  small players are irrelevant in it and forced to follow the move . 
  a fellow romanian redditor in this thread explained pretty well how they were dragged in the iraq war because of their dependency to us military . 
   there has to be a functioning alliance long before there can be a army . 
  agreed , that 's why we wo n't see it anytime soon . 
   no you argued that it would be somehow unethical in a military operation of multiple countries to have some fighting and some not . 
  and it is . 
  some bleed and some play nurses ? 
  again , the debate about an eu army is already over if you just mention something like this . 
  and fucking rightly so . 
  or you have a magic plan to change the irish and austrian constitutions to built this eu army . 
  so you 're just talking about a pale copy of nato , not an eu army . 
  again , to get back to my first reply , there is no army with some countries having an opt-out for combat missions . 
  that 's what ** you ** argued : it is possible for an eu army because it 's possible for nato . 
  that 's why alliances are not the same than armies , you do n't seem to understand the difference between the two . 
  in the reality , nato is just an alliance between sovereign countries with their sovereign armies . 
  it 's utterly irrelevant in our conversation about a unified eu army . 
   in a integrated eu army some will do combat missions and some support missions , if austria and ireland who already wo n't send a lot of troops in the first place , focus on support and training , then thats good share of responsibilities and not a problem . 
  so you 're saying that in your hypothetical eu army , some countries will only focus on support and training because they do n't want one of their soldiers to break their ankle , while others will send soldiers to get beheaded in an orange suit in the middle of the desert , with a nice video on liveleak to remember them ? 
  great sales pitch man , will definitely plays well here , and great vision of what is a `` good share of responsibilities '' . 
  thank you , so many people seem to think that trump has been elected for life and he 's 40 years old . 
  he might not even be president anymore in a few months .
