  hahaha ok fair enough . 
  come on , [ a metro ] ( http://www.konbini.com/fr/files/2014/12/metro-paris-rame-mf77-ligne.jpg ) is not a metro in italy ? 
  ffs we like languages to make things confusing . 
  sacr ** e ** bleu with no space damn it when will you get it right, 
  to put is simply , time ( subjunctive ) vs space ( indicative ) . 
  after a `` que '' , subjunctive is much more likely to be used , as subjunctive is either required or an acceptable option . 
  [ a link that goes more into details about it with many examples . 
  interesting , i 've never thought this way about it before . 
  yes . 
  pls yes, 
  on a lot of subjects i dislike m\u00e9lenchon and i did n't vote for him at the presidential election . 
  i wo n't vote for him or his party at the legislative elections . 
  i will vote for him at the next european elections though , because i agree with his plan for a social europe . 
  i 'm not socialist , communist or open-border . 
  but i want a social europe , with a big welfare state , a lot of subsidies and less competition . 
  right now , he 's the only one offering that . 
  because you think it was n't tradition in other countries ... 
  so much salt from so many different countries itt . 
  our affairs are inherently messy . 
  ultimately yes , raising polish standards to the french ( or just western ) standards is n't the goal of the eu ultimately ? 
  is n't the idea to be all rich ? 
  or did i miss something ? 
  of course . 
  i want living conditions and wages to go up , not down like it is now . 
  for everybody , i do n't consider polish workers to be the enemy here , the system that benefits big corporations at the expense of the rest is . 
  it 's pretty simple , our welfare system relies on taxes . 
  french workers pay taxes as well as their employers . 
  with the posted workers directives , hundreds of thousands of polish ( and other nationalities ) come to work in france , but they pay taxes in poland and so do their employers . 
  so , we end up with unemployed french workers replaced by cheaper foreign workers who do n't pay any tax . 
  oh but the profits of the companies who do that ? 
  through the roof , so all is great right ? 
  then when you point at that there is a problem here and our welfare system will crash if we continue like this , people like you come in and explain that international french giant corporations make tons of money by exploiting polish workers , so we should n't complain . 
  well , that 's not how it works . 
  i see you do n't understand what i 'm saying . 
  nevermind . 
  big french corporations benefit from it , most people and companies do n't really get much from it . 
  that 's the reality of the common market right now , western european welfare states are going to crash if we continue like this , while countries like poland will continue to be exploited . 
  i do n't think you understand what wage-dumping is . 
  it is a good thing you are not an important person . 
  he never talked about banning poles from competing for contracts in denmark , he said poles who are competing for these contracts should pay the same taxes and wages than danish companies . 
  under putin russians went through one of the biggest economic boom in the world , the living standards improved massively . 
  it 's a really over-simplistic view to summarise his rule by saying `` muh corruption '' `` muh oligarchs stealing money '' , there is a reason why he has such a massive support . 
  [ wages have increase a lot and constantly from 1999 to 2014 . 
  ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-07/putin-s-new-deal-spells-end-to-15-years-of-wage-gains ) he 's of course not the sole responsible of this economic growth and it 's mostly due to the price of oil and gas going up , but people associate it with him . 
  oh ok , thanks for the explanation !, 
  why is the show called ` hyde park ' ? 
  yes , basically only 7 countries have claims in antartica . 
  5 of which recognise each other 's claims but not the rest of the world . 
  it is weird . 
  she became mp at 22 ( youngest in history ) in a circonscription against a guy from les r\u00e9publicains who was winning in a landslide since 1988 ( 64,47 % in the election before she entered the game ) . 
  if you think her name was enough you seriously understimate her . 
  imo she 's far more dangerous and extreme than her aunt , and also far more intelligent and ambitious . 
  [ this is who you 're debating for context . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/6a4fh7/is_living_in_italy_as_good_as_living_in_the/dhbm8oa/?context=3 ), 
  huh , that 's very weird i do n't know a single person who considers france vs. ireland to be more important than the crunch . 
  it is the international rugby match of the season for anyone i know . 
  about the sentimental feeling , from someone who lived in both countries and still follow english media daily , i 'd say it 's a lot due to your press . 
  every week i come accross an article trashing us , mostly from shitty tabloids like the dm but also from serious magazines and newspapers . 
  it 's just not a thing here , the tabloids in france are not political and focus on popstars ( and sometimes the president coming back from a booty call on a scooter but that 's pretty exceptionnal ) . 
  [ ok germany just stay behind the bush ] ( http://reactiongifs.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/when-i-check-hot-firends-on-facebook-creepy-stalker.gif ), 
  oh come on that 's a bit harsh , [ plus he has a super hot wife . 
  ] ( http://www.femmes-de-footballeurs.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wahiba-ribery-et-franck-ribery-a-ses-debuts.jpg ) the rumour says they fell in love with each other 's teeth first . 
  ... which is why he voted remain , he had no reason to risk everything . 
  for brexit maybe , although the anti-eu sentiment in france is quite different than in the uk . 
  for trump i doubt so , unfortunately people do n't follow that closely american politics and do n't really relate to it . 
  that 's pretty much it , yes , although obviously not everyone fell for it a lot of people bought this `` new '' fn image . 
  that 's pretty much it yes , unfortunately i 'm doubtful macron will manage that . 
  there is a general distrust climate and he has n't even taken office yet that plenty of people criticise him already . 
  there are many , many people not only on the far right but also on the left that want him to fail . 
  i just explained these were 2 different elections ... 
  ok , first you have to separate what the media , in particular the foreign media , reported about the election and the reality . 
  no one , absolutely no one , from the fn or anywhere else , thought marine le pen had an actual shot at winning the presidency this year . 
  let 's be serious there , 2 years ago already [ marine le pen herself defined her whole long-term strategy for a victory in 2022 . 
  ] ( http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/politique/20140919.obs9779/en-panne-de-cerveaux-marine-le-pen-vise-plus-2022-que-2017.html ) of course they wanted to win , it does n't mean they believed they could . 
  their goal was 40 % or a little bit more , which they did n't achieve . 
  but winning ? 
  that was never something she or the party believed . 
  some gullible naive supporters maybe , but the one i talked to never thought it was something possible . 
  and i have no idea how you can claim we 're at the height of populism , at least in france . 
  it 's growing , but the height ? 
  no one can tell if we reached the peak unless you have a crystal ball . 
  you 're comparing the ** regional ** election of 2015 with a presidential election . 
  in 2010 at the previous ** regional ** election the fn got 11,42 % . 
  thank you for proving my point . 
  thanks mate , it is just incredible to read foreigners saying things like that while no one in france , no political analyst or random person has this kind of thought today . 
  people used to think that in 2002 , because that was just an accident and le pen got crushed in the 2nd turn . 
  then in 2007 the fn was `` over '' , but people realised that what just sarkozy stealing votes from le pen by adopting the same rhetoric . 
  now everybody understood that the fn and le pen are here to stay and i 'm seriously concerned about how much she 'll get in 2022 after 5 years of macron . 
  winning the european elections and being runner-up in the presidential election of one of the most powerful country in the world = has achieved bugger all . 
  what do i except from people who do n't even speak french to understand anyway , i 'm just wasting my time . 
  i 've never assumed traditional parties are done forever , i do n't know where you got that . 
  all i 'm saying is that it is the highest score they 've ever managed to get and writting them off is not only stupid , it 's plain dangerous . 
  not a single person in france is saying that today , but some european political expert who did n't know anything about our politics a month ago now declare that the fn , a party almost constantly growing for the past 45 years , is now `` finished '' after 10\u00a0644\u00a0118 voted for them . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  because i 'm sorry but your comment completely ignores the fact that since marine le pen took over the fn they constantly crushed their previous historical results . 
  they 've never had that many elected representatives , they won the european elections , they 've never held that many towns and they just made their highest score ever in a presidential election . 
  they 're expected to have at least 15 mps ( enough to form a group , which is a huge thing in our parliamentary system ) elected in one month , they currently have only 2 . 
  how the fuck are they finished ? 
  oh no i got it , you have a crystal ball and all the problems that made people vote for her will just disappear in the next months . 
  i 'm sorry but writing them off because they lost this election just shows how little you know about french politics or just politics in general .
