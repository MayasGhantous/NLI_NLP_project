  and do n't forget that macron is elected not because people are ecstatic about him or his policies , but because of who he was facing . 
  43 % of us voted for him just to stop her . 
   fn are finished . 
  they 've just made the biggest score of the history of their party genius , it 's an historical result for them . 
  oops my bad , it was still decomissionned a few months ago anyway . 
  was n't catobar and it was decomissionned a few months ago anyway . 
  it was an old french aircraft carrier to begin with , brazil is nowhere near having the capacity to build one on its own . 
  yes , the charles de gaulle is the only non-american catobar aircraft carrier . 
  ah yeah you 're right , phrasing was a bit weird though . 
  i think you meant `` exporter '' unless italy is buying from these countries . 
  that is a very square vision of the world . 
  wow , must be hard to live in the world where you consider most people abnormal . 
  really ? 
  so you 're either slim or not healthy ? 
  i think you 're mixing up everything here . 
  anorexic models are not slim models . 
  they 're sick human beings who need medical attention . 
  obese models are not plus-size models . 
  they 're sick human beings who need medical attention . 
  [ this is a slim model .

  ] ( https://imgur.com/syblnvy ) see the differences ? 
   not saying numbers do n't count . 
  they do . 
  but putting more importance on the most underdeveloped because they reproduce more , does n't seem quite right . 
  well i was talking purely about growth of french speakers , if we 're taking into account other factors such as economy or hdi then i agree it gets more complicated . 
   it is certainly very plausible that french will dominate northern africa . 
  it 's just not completely certain in my view . 
  french wo n't leave the region , for sure . 
  but i find it hard to dismiss , on a long term perspective , competition from arabic in that region . 
  again , i 've never said french would dominate north africa , my point is specifically that one language will not prevail over the other because they have different roles . 
  they will continue to cohabit . 
  and i understood that you 're not claiming portuguese was stronger in africa , and i did n't want to undermine the place of portuguese in africa either , especially with angola being one of the most stable and developped country of the continent . 
   i 'm sure germany would also not allow americans and japanese people who are german citizens to vote on a referendum like this one . 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  but the big population growth in french speaking africa is mostly in west african countries where arabic is non-existent which is my point . 
  there is no competition with arabic there . 
  as for north african countries , french and arabic along with berber languages have been living together for a while now and it 's pretty stable . 
  none of them is going to disappear for the other , they all have a different purpose and history . 
  the example of morocco going back to french for education illustrates this pretty well , after the decolonisation there was a big push to make everything more arabic which is understandable . 
  but they had to make a practical decision and go back to french . 
  if there is a dependency , that 's precisely north african arab-speaking countries towards french . 
  nearly 60 years after their independence it is still alive and they even have to give it a more important role . 
  actually the most important , education . 
  i did n't count ~ 90 million vs ~ 100 million , i just gave the example of the rdc alone having 80 million inhabitants already and ** there are 20 other french-speaking countries ** . 
  you did n't understand what i said , cameroon , ivory coast or madagascar all have about 20 + million inhabitants , that makes 70 million inhabitants for them and there are 17 others like burkina faso with 18 million , senegal with 15 million , etc. . . 
  in french-speaking africa arabic is a regional language almost exclusively used in 3 countries in north africa + tchad and djibouti . 
  arabic is non-existent in the large majority . 
   what you mention regarding morocco moving education to french is indeed a point towards french . 
  but it 's just one country , who will continue to be native in arabic , and who knows what the future will bring . 
  it 's already almost 1/3 of the total `` arabic '' population , and do n't forget morocco is not an arabic country but mostly a berber country ( they make up 60 % of the population ) . 
  arabic is the first language but amazigh and other berber languages are spoken natively by 27-45 % of the population . 
  it 's not saudi arabia , you have a very simple view of it . 
  and anyway , for other countries like tunisia , the trend is not towards more arabic but towards english . 
   my point is that it 's a very different situation from that of say , angola with respect to portuguese , where portuguese is most people 's native language , and the home language for the vast majority ( and home language is the future native language ) . 
  sure , the situation is simpler when you just have 5 countries , including 2 with less than 1 million inhabitants . 
  i mean , i get your point , but i do n't see how comparing [ this ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/afrique_francophone#/media/file:francophone_africa.svg ) to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese-speaking_african_countries#/media/file:palop.svg ) is really relevant . 
   most african french speaking countries speak arabic natively . 
  what the hell are you smoking ? 
  morocco , algeria and tunisia make up altogether about 90 million inhabitants . 
  the democratic republic of the congo ** alone ** has 80 million inhabitants and no arabic is spoken , and there are 20 other french-speaking countries including cameroon , ivory coast or madagascar who have 20 + million inhabitants . 
  hell , morocco switched back from arabic to french as the education language a few months ago because of the lack of prospects with an education in arabic and the islamisation problem . 
  you have a very simple lecture of who the resistants were . 
  my grand-father risked his life to join the free french forces when he realised p\u00e9tain betrayed the country and fought until the end of the war against the nazis in north-africa and italy . 
  he got decorated and my dad still has his resistant card . 
  yet you would probably faint if you heard what he was saying about jews or his thoughts about an independent algeria . 
  this was a war against germany , and plenty of ultra-nationalists hated being occupied by germans . 
  they also hated the communists . 
  and they hated the jews . 
  the way history is dicussed on reddit most of the time is no different than the way de gaulle explained `` all of france was resistant '' , it 's purely ideological and false , with no nuance and totally manichaean . 
  i 'm sorry but i see you are completely ignorant about stuxnet . 
  this virus has not `` only targeted a very limited bit of infrastructure '' , it targeted a lot more than that and ended up infecting systems all around the globe . 
  the bushehr nuclear power plant it targeted among others was operationnal and iran is as we speak building new reactors for this facility , do you know why ? 
  because it is civilian nuclear power . 
  it was not a research facility and stuxnet attack , by the way , made obama incredibly furious when he learned it was launched without his approval in the middle of the negociations with iran . 
  but i 'm glad you do n't have a problem with it , you certainly know better than the potus . 
  i suggest you to watch zero days for more information . 
   the key difference , though , is that the nsa , gchq , and other western intelligence agencies , have not tried to use their information - and electronic-warfare capabilities to actively destroy and sabotage liberal , democratic governments . 
  first it 's very weird to use `` liberal '' . 
  is it a badge of honour that prevents you from attacks ? 
  a conservative government against immigration and abortion would be an ok target ? 
  we have literally no idea about the sabotage part . 
  what we know about the surveillance of the nsa is a drop in the ocean . 
  it was unthinkable that the nsa would tap the phone of the german chancellor 10 years ago , yet here we are . 
  what did they do with the information they collected ? 
  we have no idea . 
  we know they spied on fran\u00e7ois hollande between the two rounds of the election in 2012 . 
  we do n't know if they used that information to weigh in the election . 
  one thing for sure , is i would n't be as affirmative as you are converning their actions . 
  so i see we actually mostly agree !, 
  about your last paragraph i 'd be a bit more moderate though . 
  i still do think western powers engage in sometimes very similar agression than russia . 
  i suggest you read for example about the stuxnet virus that has simply no comparison . 
  or more broadly , the nsa surveillance network that dwarfs pretty much anything else and very , very agressively targets allies , including head of states directly . 
  imagine for a second the outrage if we learned than putin listened directly to merkel and hollande ... and germany and france are some of the closest allies of the us . 
  now that being said , if we 're talking about what is to me pure and simple colonisation of territories in ukraine and georgia then i agree there is no comparison . 
  you 're right about russia , this influence is used for geopolitical interests rather than spreading ideas and values . 
  though i 'd put in a completely different category a country like saudi arabia which we are at war with , a cultural war but still a war .
