  as i said , the secularism process started in the 18th century during the enlightment . 
  it took us centuries to get rid of it and islamic countries have n't even started a similar movement . 
  the only secular muslim countries like tunisia basically copied the western model , but it 's not a product of their own thinkers . 
  that is a massive difference . 
  saying it 's only historical factors and geopolitics is completely denying how such a powerful religion like islam can shape the thought of countries following it . 
  would you say europe has n't been shaped by christianity ? 
  the science ? 
  the culture ? 
  the arts ? 
  the philosophy ? 
  no , because that would be absolute nonsense . 
  i would add that the enlightment happened during a time where the islamic world was untouched and certainly not colonised . 
  actually the opposite was happening and the ottoman empire was still violently expanding . 
  nah he 's just german . 
   the idea that islam is some great evil that prevents this is a load of bigoted crap based on total ignorance of history . 
  it 's not that it 's a great evil , but it does prevent democracy . 
  do you know what secularism is ? 
  the idea is to keep islam ** the fuck out ** of the state affairs ** in order to be ** a democracy . 
  same is true for other religions and islam is no exception , when the state is ruled or deeply influenced by a medieval fantasy book that believes an old man in the sky decides things , it does n't go anywhere . 
  we in the west paved the way to modern democracy with the enlightment , when we decided to take out religion ( christianity ) out of our laws . 
  the problem with islamic coutries is the large majority do n't have secularism and are far behind most developped countries despite having a lot of potential . 
  and as long as islam is ruling and not common sense , they wo n't go anywhere . 
  longer moustache changes everything . 
  but he looks so nice [ look at him laughing like a kid ] ( http://admin.balkaneu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gr15.jpg ), 
  let 's be real , i doubt the average french voter even knows who sch\u00e4uble is . 
  people know merkel , that 's it . 
  oh forgot about him as well . 
  he would probably join the band after m\u00e9lenchon helped him during his revolution that made him prime minister of the socialist united kingdom , better known as the suk !, 
  he would probably ally to venezuela to declare war to the us !, 
  til the snails i buy sometimes that you can find in any supermarket are a fancy thing . 
  seriously , snails can be found in a lot of brasseries anywhere in paris and while i do n't eat some every week , this is nothing exceptional either . 
  i do n't see how it 's a bad habit , are you a snail rights activist ? 
  no shit, 
   most french people i 've met have very good english i 'm gon na save this comment . 
  just to rectify something ( very common mistake ) france never left nato , we left the integrated command which is very different . 
  france remained a full member of nato from 1966 until we rejoined the integrated command in 2009 . 
   it is n't that complicated for the us to do if they wanted . 
  lol yes it is , that 's why they never did it and never will . 
   yes they could fly in transport planes full of ordinance and troops from north dakota even refuelling in mid-air if needed . 
  not for something like the iraq or afghanistan war they could n't . 
  do you realise how many planes are necessary to fly over hundreds of thousands of people across the planet ? 
  how many boats ? 
  i 'm gon na quit here , we 're talking about something that never happened and never will , and you base your arguments on nothing more than a `` they could if they wanted '' which is pointless to argue against . 
  we 'll just disagree on this , no hard feelings and see you around mate . 
  look at me , look at me , i 'm the senate , the prime minister , the president and the sultan now . 
  done deal , i 'll send an email to notify the un tomorrow . 
  their own bases where ? 
  north dakota ? 
  yes , logistics and air support based in their bases in allied countries . 
  i just repeated what i heard here for the past days from turks who were not erdogan fanboys , do n't get mad at me mate . 
  and how the hell would they transport these hundreds of thousands without their allies ? 
  i 'm just considering how could they . 
  they could n't . 
  and they never did without them for a good reason . 
  sure france relies on the us for logistical assistance , we are very limited in some areas . 
  and while you 're right the us does n't really need technical support from its allies , it relies heavily and needs its allies to project power through the us bases they 're hosting . 
  the logistical support the us provided for lybia came from italy , iraq or afghanistan without the us bases in italy , germany or saudi arabia would have been impossible . 
  the us bases all over the world are a big reason why your military is so powerful . 
  it would become extremely complicated if the eu for instance decided to kick americans out ( which i do n't think will happen anytime soon for various reasons ) . 
   i do n't understand how it 's not a good example ? 
  europe ran out of munitions and needed help from the u.s for logistics . 
  it 's not a good example because the us always ask for allies and does n't go bomb a country on its own either . 
   also this is n't related , just thinking out loud , but to this day on reddit i see libya being blamed on u.s all the time , even though it was an european lead endeavor : / really ? 
  i always read france/uk/us being blamed for it especially here , no one forgot sarkozy being the main idiot behind it . 
   they could have easily occupied iraq for as long as they wanted . 
  how the hell do you occupy a country with a carrier strike group ?? 
  this is absolute nonsense , the iraq war required hundreds of thousands of military personal and do n't get me started about the vehicles and all the gear . 
  this is not a video game where you just bomb the shit out of your enemy for fuck sake . 
  france , the uk or russia can basically destroy any country on the planet with their nuclear arsenal therefore they 're on par with the us with your logic ? 
  but what kind of military power are we talking about ? 
  the uk or france can project military power anywhere on their own as well , but it would be extremely limited . 
  the us is of course 10 times more powerful and could hit any country pretty badly , but an operation like in iraq or afghanistan without support from their allies ? 
  no way . 
  an islamist version of it . 
  lovely !, 
  really ? 
  how would they sustain this prolonged military campaign without their bases in allied countries ? 
  without support from dozens of countries who let them have bases where they project power ( i know this is a win-win situation for the countries hosting these bases ) , they would be mostly isolated an ocean away from the action . 
  they currently project power in the middle-east from germany , italy and saudi arabia among others . 
  britain and france were military powerful because their colonies allowed them to project power directly from there , russia is fighting in syria and this is where they have a military base that allows them to project power in the mediterranean . 
  the us has military bases all over the world and this is a huge reason of their global dominance . 
  this is not `` political '' , it 's a material necessity for them . 
  i do n't know , a lot of polls showed it would be a pretty close result and despite the current situation in turkey this is not north korea . 
  i 've read a lot of turks here saying the election will be observed so carefully it would be hard for erdogan to cheat massively . 
  i do n't think europe is a superpower , even less a military superpower , i just pointed out that your example was not the best to make your point . 
  the article is actually bashing americans . 
  you 're right , proves my point even more !, 
  oops ok then , my mistake . 
  what jealousy ? 
  britain was the biggest power of the 19th century , no doubt about that . 
  but the way british think the entire earth was their backyard is quite ridiculous and i see pretty often british who basically claim that british empire = the world . 
  one of these claims that i see often is `` the british abolished slavery worldwide '' . 
  well yeah sure , if you ignore pretty much all of south and north america , the french empire , major huge countries like russia who abolished it a century before , sure this is worldwide . 
  even english was n't a language considered as relevant as french or german at the time , but somehow in the mind of british nationalists the whole world was asking britain before taking a piss . 
  the british a global police force ? 
  in europe or america as well ? 
  please . 
  pax britannica ended in 1870 with the franco-prussian war , because it was mostly a myth and the british had no military influence on big continental powers , only on trade . 
  when germany and france decided to go to war , this `` global police '' role was only existing in your head . 
  when the us went to civil war , the british `` global police '' was also irrelevant .
