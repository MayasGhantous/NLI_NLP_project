  it 's by far the most important election , you 're electing the person who is going to represent you and vote the laws in your name at the parliament . 
   less than 10 % of laws voted by parliament are initiated by the parliament  the most important laws passed have been propositions of the govt :  abortion made legal : simone veil health minister made legal by the parliament who approved a bill of simone veil , health minister . 
   gay marriage taubira justice minister made legal by the parliament who approved a bill of christiane taubira , justice minister . 
   retirement reforms : various govts all approved by the parliament . 
   abolition of death penalty : mitterrand abolition of death penalty by the parliament . 
   labour reforms : macron adopted by the parliament . 
  who cares who initiated laws ? 
  they are voted ** by the parliament ** . 
  mps are the one who approve it at the end , they modify and add amendments to them , which is why legislative are the most important elections in terms of power . 
   i believe the logic is to keep the sentences less than those for murder , so the perpetrators will not have an incentive to murder the victims . 
  it 's a weird logic you have there . 
  if someone rapes then murder someone , he 's going to be judged for both and get a longer sentence . 
   are we though ? 
  last presidential election we had 79 % turnout and we were already talking about how low it was . 
  it 's ridiculous to compare our presidential election with the brexit referendum , these are completely different votes . 
  plus , the number is very flattering , the legislative elections that followed in 2012 , where we elect our mps , the people who , you know , are voting and making the bills that affect us all , only 58 % showed up . 
  so they mostly do n't give a shit about other countries . 
  i do n't know how u/ibmthink find the patience to answer you man , you really are insufferable . 
  he just explained the roots of the social problems in the turkish population in germany , he did n't `` wash his hands and put the blame on the turks '' . 
  the beer lobby in germany should contact the wine lobby in france , here they managed to get this right a while ago now . 
  yep , a little conspiracy theory never hurts right ? 
  but it 's not just a concert , just a band or just a concert hall anymore . 
  sure , for a regular band i would n't care much about their personal political views and would enjoy the music . 
  personally what he said or thinks would n't stop me from listening to eodm , but he really should have shut the fuck up on this . 
  he also said among other stupid things : `` did your french gun control stop a single person from dying at the bataclan ? 
  '' , and people found out he was the stereotypical american religious redneck . 
   an anti-eu leftist party is not going to extract any concessions from the eu any more than cameron could or tsipras could . 
  one anti-eu leftist portuguese party , no , but there are similar movements growing more and more everywhere in western europe . 
  ** snobby french statement incoming : * i always considered german bread to be the only real challenger to our bread . 
   we are talking about security contractors in a war zone , not cia black ops in the americas . 
  you claimed nobody knew about blackwater 's iraq contract at the time , and i gave you an article that showed the press and the public were indeed aware at the time . 
  in fact , you can read the publicly available reports here that detail how many security contractors are and were on payroll in the middle east . 
  what part of the word `` after '' do n't you understand ? 
  these reports are made available ** after ** the contract was signed , and only gives the number of private contractors personal , not the company they 're working for , with vague categories like `` security '' and `` base support '' with no details at all about what they 're actually doing there . 
  `` base support '' could be a guy frying eggs or holding a machine gun , nobody knows . 
  and yes , the public did n't know anything about blackwater 's iraq contract before journalists started to investigate them . 
  it 's not like the pentagon started to throw around reports with the details of the contracts , again , read the link i gave earlier about the contract that was reported in 2015 for the 2002-2014 period . 
  and that 's only because a watchdog went through the report . 
   are you saying the russian government breaking its own laws is not newsworthy , or are you saying governments concealing the use of security contractors is not newsworthy and acceptable in general ? 
  just pointed out the transparency you claimed the us government demonstrated is not transparent at all , that 's it . 
  from your article :  when the companies do screw up , however , ** their status as private entities often shields them -- and the government -- from public scrutiny . 
  ** in 2001 , an alabama-based firm called aviation development corp. that provided reconnaissance for the cia in south america misidentified an errant plane as possibly belonging to cocaine traffickers . 
  based on the company 's information , the peruvian air force shot down the aircraft , killing a u.s. missionary and her seven-month-old daughter . 
  afterward , ** when members of congress tried to investigate , the state department and the cia refused to provide any information , ** citing privacy concerns . 
  ** `` we ca n't talk about it , '' administration officials told congress , ** according to a source familiar with the incident . 
  `` it 's a private entity . 
  call the company . '', 
  of course you know they exist , they 're not a secret assassins brotherhood , you know that they are in iraq , afghanistan or wherever . 
  you do n't know shit about what they do , how much they received for it and for how long they 're going to be there . 
  thank you for proving my point , and next time maybe read the article you want to use to prove yours . 
   we ** knew ** how many security contractors were in afghanistan , iraq , kuwait , and so on  ** knew ** you did n't know , you learned afterwards , which is my point . 
  but hey , if you 're ok with learning 13 years after the contract was signed how much of your tax money they got and what they did with it , good for you . 
  that 's so much better than what russia does , because you have an incomplete report after the contract is over . 
   that 's different than what the us did - we knew how many security contractors were in afghanistan , iraq , kuwait , and so on because the american department of defense issues reports detailing how many people they have in those countries . 
  it was n't a secret . 
  you did n't know shit before journalists like jeremy scahill exposed them to public scrutiny with his book * blackwater : the rise of the world 's most powerful mercenary army * . 
  for example , it was revealed in 2015 that academi ( new name of blackwater ) [ received $ 569 million between 2002 and 2014 for a training program in afghanistan . 
  ] ( https://www.thenation.com/article/blackwater-still-top-pentagon-contractor-afghanistan-training/ ) so unless you 're a top official from the pentagon or academi , you do n't know jack shit about contracts they receive , you learn about it after the show is over . 
   it probably makes sense on some diplomatic level that i do n't understand . 
  you do n't have to justify the death of soldiers to public opinion , you can make them do very , very nasty stuff and always claim you do n't know who they are or who they 're fighting for , etc. . . watch the movie `` the expendables '' , it 's a fun version of it and if you do n't want to bother with an hour and a half of killing and explosion , well , everything you have to understand about why mercenaries are used so much is in the title . 
  ok my bad , i thought you were talking about syria , i 'll go jump out of the window now . 
  ~ ~ former u.s. 
  ambassador to syria : ~ ~  ~ ~ `` ** american mercenaries ** , that 's what i 'd call them . 
  they 're trained by americans . 
  they 're paid by americans . 
  they 're supposed to fight for american goals -- which are out of synch with local priorities . '' ~ ~ ~ ~ [ * our high-priced mercenaries in syria , * by the new yorker ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/our-high-priced-mercenaries-in-syria ) ~ ~ ~ ~ but i 'm sure this citation wo n't satisfy you . ~ ~, 
  as long as we continue to accept that gulf monarchies finance mosques and train our imams with their disgusting wahhabi ideology , it is only damage control as you say so . 
  oh come on , no country is perfect and education in the uk has obviously its flaws but `` britain ` one of worst places to raise children ' '' is outright insulting to the dozens of countries which are actually battling for the worst place in the world for children award . 
  especially in a time when there are thousands of children risking their lives to reach britain because their countries ** are ** the worse . 
  edit : the report you linked was conducted in australia , singapore , hong kong , the uae , the us and the uk . 
  the world , then . 
  they 've invaded two of their helplessly isolated neighboors , not members of the eu or nato or both though . 
  that 's quite a difference . 
  a good example of a country that should be concerned ( read : if you 're not pro-russian or russian-moldovan ) is moldova . 
   i cant wait for the next president in france . 
  all the candidat said they would trash the touquet 's treaty which will de facto put back english border in dover . 
  that wo n't happen , it would be terrible for both the uk and france . 
  it 's just candidates trying to make the headline , they wo n't do shit . 
  i can see the logic in it , especially about competitiveness . 
  some companies survived because a foreign investor bought it and invested a lot in it . 
  but again , i doubt there are many examples about prices going down for britons after a foreign takeover of a british company . 
   to end up with lower prices and more competitive companies . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  edf ( french ) makes you pay more for electricity or land rover did n't become cheaper when tata bought it . 
  i 'm really curious of what examples of british companies getting bought by foreigners gave lower prices to british consumers . 
  except a car is just an object , not a company with its patents , innovations and r&d department that you 'll move to your country after a few years , giving you a significant asset in a competitive industrial sector . 
  small difference . 
  weird article . 
  the do n't officially exist , their titles are meaningless , some if not most have lost part or all of the wealth of their families , they do n't have any privilege anymore , but somehow the author see them as a thriving force . 
  probably easier to ban children under 16 . 
  which is the point of a racket , you do n't have the choice and end up paying . 
  and they still ask you why do you wan na come in the us , where are you going and why . 
  an airline decided i have to stop by your airport on my way to another country , i already have to pay for it so just let me go and leave me the fuck alone !, 
  yeah , it 's a weird article . 
  nobel prizes are what they are because of the credit people give them , just like the michelin stars or the pulitzer prizes . 
  and seriously , swedish cultural imperialism ? ... 
  stop invading our cultures with your ikea and nobel prizes sweden , i see what you 're doing here and i 'm triggered by your imperialism mentality !, 
   but there is nothing wrong with a private chinese firm buying a private german firm . 
  but there is something wrong with the fact a private german firm can not buy a private chinese firm , which is the problem here . 
  it 's a one way street .
