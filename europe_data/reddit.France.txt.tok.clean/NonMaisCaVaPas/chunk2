  that 's good . 
  i wish we did the same in france . 
  but there would be complaints because the prices would be rounded up . 
  more context here : http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hrbm4/france_bans_the_words_facebook_and_twitter_from/, 
  dammit , i forgot kosovo . 
  in french , we say `` ricains '' ( end of `` am\u00e9ricains '' ) . 
  it 's not really offensive but often used for being a bit sarcastic . 
  i hope so . 
  what is a little bit worrying is that the far right says that people from the ump ( including sarkozy ) agrees that something needs to be done . 
  apparently , some ump are working on it and sarkozy told them he would n't put his veto on that . 
   le pen 's got a triple play going - pandering to her voters against scary algerian immigrants , scoring points against a leftist party , and and putting herself forward as a no-seriously-i-mean-the-best-for-france representative of all that 's good and pure about politics here . 
  i agree completely . 
   sounds like the kind of person that would be really good in french politics yes , she had some nice ideas and did some really encouraging actions . 
  unfortunately , on other subjects , her party have some positions that not a lot of people agree on ( me included ) . 
  they lean towards alter-globalisation . 
  for instance : decrease retirement age , turn off nuclear power ( i do n't think it 's realistic . 
  decrease it , ok ) , big education reform ( might be good , but i 'm afraid of the risks of decreasing the level ) ... i would definitely vote for them in the parliament , but maybe not * that * extreme for presidency ( you know that in france , the president have a lot of power ; i would say too much ) . 
  to be fair , the point was more that if a bi-national have a high responsibility ( like president ) , it can influence its decisions ( especially for foreign politics ) . 
  i can understand this concern . 
  it 's not a problem with norway but if it was with the us for instance , it could be . 
  maybe we can think of putting some kind of checking for the decisions about it in that case ( like a council , i do n't know ) . 
  but le pen worded it really differently , saying that she was `` shocked that someone who can vote in another country can also be president '' and some shit like `` this kind of people are `` homeland-less '' ( pun with the french for homeless ) ( she included cohn-bendit , who was elected in germany before france ) . 
  [ link in french ] ( http://www.lexpress.fr/actualites/2/eva-joly-ne-peut-pas-etre-candidate-en-2012-dit-marine-le-pen_916445.html ) . 
  eva joly answered that le pen wants to divide the french citizens , and that she proved her attachment to france by spending her life here and working for the public hospital and then justice . 
  she also insisted that she is thankful for the generosity of france since she could access high positions ( magistrate and president ) without being born here . 
  [ video in french ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyvrvowr090 ) . 
  found it . 
  she also attacked eva joly a while ago , who is a candidate for presidency for `` europe-\u00c9cologie '' ( one of the green parties ) , because she is bi-national ( with norway ) . 
  i think it was jamel debbouze ( not the best philosopher , but eh ... ) who said `` i do n't want to choose between morocco and france like i do n't want to choose between my father and mother '' . 
  i thought the comparison made sense . 
  i know , but this was the only article i could find in english . 
  that 's why i posted a comment with a better one in french . 
  a better article [ in french ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2011/06/01/01002-20110601artfig00664-marine-le-pen-demande-la-fin-de-la-binationalite.php ) , and [ google translation ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lefigaro.fr%2fpolitique%2f2011%2f06%2f01%2f01002-20110601artfig00664-marine-le-pen-demande-la-fin-de-la-binationalite.php ) . 
  andorra , monaco , san marino and the vatican are part of the eu , they are represented by other countries . 
  they even use the euro ( and have their own coins ) . 
  i 'm not sure about liechtenstein . 
  this is a really negative point of view ... btw , posting this does n't mean i agree . 
  then , we would send them merkel and sarkozy . 
  that will teach them . 
  the ecb i guess ? 
  i just hope we wo n't build more power plants in france to compensate that . 
  15 rich people ? 
  you 're thinking of liechtenstein . 
  apparently it 's voted . 
  i use http://www.gandi.net/ their interface is really comprehensive ( and you can go in a lot of configuration if you want ) . 
  also , they have a very good and nice support . 
  in general , you should use a company that you can trust for a domain name . 
  some can seem cheap but get you into a lot of difficulty when you want to change something ( like the ones that does n't let you go elsewhere by blocking your domain ) . 
  that 's why i chose gandi , they have a great reputation . 
  for your hosting , you can take the cheapest though , since you can change easily . 
  apparently a lot of serbian people support him . 
  we should use brasil 's approach . 
  they reproduce all the crappy conditions of entry on us territory for us citizen who enters brasil . 
  like when the us decided to take a photo of all passengers , brasil did the same for americans . 
  i do n't really know this field . 
  yes , $ 50k is normal for a beginner . 
  after a french engineering school ( 5 years , equivalent of meng or msc ) $ 35k is normal , $ 40k is already good ( i saw airbus proposing $ 29k for an msc in the uk , everyone thought it was low , even with the advantages ) . 
  of course , it can go up quickly after a bit of experience . 
  we usually say that you need to remove one third of taxes ( that 's very rough , maybe too high ) . 
  but i think i miss something because the level of living is comparable with the us so i wonder why the salaries are so different ( maybe healthcare , education ... ) . 
  some people say that you can go work abroad ( us , middle east ) to save money quickly then come back . 
  it depends on the field . 
  i 'm in engineering , and industry in the uk have the reputation of being screwed ( actually it 's more than a reputation ; they 're good at banking ) . 
  engineering jobs in the uk seem to be less paid than in france or germany ( but i 'm not certain about this , and there are exceptions like oil and gas ) . 
  salaries in the us seem incredibly high from here . 
  apparently , with an msc it 's not uncommon to start with ~ $ 75k , whereas it would be more like ~ $ 50k in europe ( before taxes ) . 
  yes , that 's the opinion of the general population about americans here . 
  basically a good part of them are ok , but they got a big part of dumbasses ( not that we do n't have some , but the general reputation is that the us have far more ) . 
  i 'm talking about the `` we 're the best country/they want our freedom/our troups brought democracy/socialism is evil/what do you mean other countries '' kind of dumbasses . 
  when i told my mother that i might apply to jobs in the us as well , she asked me `` are you sure ? '' . 
  then i told her it would be for 1 or 2 years max ( because i do n't want trouble with visas and do n't want to spend my life there ) , so she said ok . she was perfectly fine with any european country though . 
  yes , i must admit i really do n't know why . 
  apart from reddit , do you have this impression in america ( that some people want to leave because they 're sick of it ) ? 
  if you know people who want to move , which reason comes most frequently ? 
  i do n't like these reforms either . 
  i did n't hear this from the government , they keep repeating that it 's to reduce the mortality . 
  i suspect this sentence was from afftac . 
  because the proportion of europeans is very small here ? 
  it makes us realize that the us is not as good as we could imagine it ( they have their problems , as any country does ) . 
  also , it looks like most people who talk about expatriation here do it because they ca n't bear their country anymore ( the `` fuck the us , i 'm moving to norway '' thing ) . 
  in reality , most people i know who wants to move do it because they want to discover/experience another culture that seems interesting , not because they particularly want to leave their country . 
  for instance , i want to work abroad next year , but it 's not because i do n't like france . 
  so i do n't say `` fuck france , i 'm moving '' , i just sometimes ask questions to expats in / r/iwantout . 
   speak the languages of these countries also ? 
  the stats depends on the country , but if people could learn english properly it would already be good ^ ^ . 
  i agree . 
  most of my friends who wants to go abroad ( all engineers ) want to stay in europe . 
  the culture is different enough and you avoid a lot of hassle . 
  personally i looked to the us a few years ago ( because a lot of companies are really interesting for me over there ) but the politics and reddit made me think otherwise . 
  some people still want to go to the us , but most of them do n't really consider staying there for years . 
  canada on the other hand is really attractive , especially in france for those who do n't speak english enough ( they can move to french canada ) . 
  nice concept . 
  it comes close enough to the [ sikorsky x2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sikorsky_x2 ) ( 450 km/h ) to compete . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  the french media gives a lot of names . 
  [ for instance ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2011/05/19/04016-20110519dimwww00403-qui-va-prendre-la-tete-du-fmi-a.php ) ( in french , but you get the names ) . 
  it 's far from played . 
  some would like a developing country citizen ( europe do n't really want that ) , and apparently the americans are uncomfortable giving it to a french again after the dsk affair ( which is the worst argument they can come up with ) . 
  switzerland did it . 
  they have cameras * everywhere * .
