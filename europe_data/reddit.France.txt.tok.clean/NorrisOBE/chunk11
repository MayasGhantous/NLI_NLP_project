  so what 's up with the huge numbers of british nationals joining daesh then ? 
  it has never been moderate since 2001 . 
  most british sunni mosques are funded by saudis , pakistanis and qataris . 
  they do not represent british and european values in comparison to shiite , sufi and ahmadiyya mosques . 
  look , you may be new here , but russia today is where many top minds collaborate , and routinely outsmart the most well funded , well equipped and diabolical organizations on earth . 
  how do we do it ? 
  top thinkers , experts on every field , unparalleled investigative skills and fearlessness . 
  i would trust a top rt news report over pretty much any news source , especially a mainstream source , any day . 
  as a malaysian-born i say this : `` go die lah . '', 
  you call your shithole `` perfect '' ? 
  you guys do n't even believe in diplomacy . 
  and everyone 's trying to kill you because you 've decalred war on almost everyone . 
  the reasons why you 're saying these because you and every other european fighter in daesh are being treated like princesses while the average residents of raqqa and mosul are starving to death . 
  you guys are a bunch of spoiled , shithead narcissstic brats who only joined daesh because you found an islamic cult that allows you to be spoiled , shithead narcissstic brats . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  why is it that everytime a daily calais migrant thread pops up at / r/europe , the most simple of all solutions that benefits french people the most are the ones that gets downvoted alot ? 
  is it because of british butthurt or some shit ? 
  i do n't see any reason why our government should keep these people at bay . 
  they do n't speak french , they refuse to integrate into france and they prefer living in the warm comforts of british society . 
  i just want them to just leave calais and just go to their destination so that we should never hear about these people again . 
  is it too much to ask ? 
  no doubt . 
  time and time again passing laws that aims to suppress personal liberty and speech is exactly what daesh and al-qaeda wanted . 
  they want an environment where people with names like `` mohamed '' will live in fear and disenfranchisement . 
  they want local police to think that a kebab stall is a terrorist recruitment center . 
  they want the west to be paranoid , and for some reason western leaders agree to such paranoia . 
  [ they want europe to have the same type of environment that america had post-9 / 11 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2ba6gh/til_that_the_fbi_tried_to_infiltrate_a_mosque_in/ ) . 
  hell , i just ca n't wait for [ the eu to legalize torture as a means of `` protecting europe agains radical islam '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senate_intelligence_committee_report_on_cia_torture ), 
  seriously with koreans , japanese and chinese people getting atatcked in both greece and turkey it seems that it 's a horrible time for asians to visit the eastern mediterranean . 
  when i was in medina for a family pilgrimage i was packing things up to go to jeddah and then a turkish family came to our room and kick us out without letting us return the key to the reception . 
  what . 
  the . 
  so who 's gon na join immortan alexis and the ( fukasheema kamakrazee ) warboys ? 
  yeah , i saw that scene and i was like `` whoa did the writers just randomly darted countries off a map to see who runs mars in the future besides japan ? '', 
  and whoops , i got colombia confused with lithuania :p, 
  and that `` liberation '' was all bullshit , just like those `` wmds '' . 
  the war on iraq should have never happened , and shame on the european countries who supported the neoconservative bush administration in this phony bullshit war . 
  which is funny because [ slovakia was a member of the coalition of the willing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multi-national_force_%e2%80%93_iraq ), 
  wow , alan grayson , keith ellison and bernie sanders ? 
  this letter totally helps establish bernie sanders ' foreign policy credentials . 
  yesterday i talked about empathy-building as a model to deradicalize radical muslims in europe . 
  and thank god it 's actually being applied right now . 
  it 's pretty obvious that north korea does a lot of inhumane experiments . 
  i mean , they have like dozens of concentration camps . 
  it 's obvious that some of those have really sickening forms of inhuman experiments being done . 
  hell , camp 14 is so huge that i bet 20 % of that place is where they experiment prisoners to study effects of mustard gas or take out prisoner organs and sell those to hospitals all over north korea and china . 
  well , in rehabilitation of radical islamists you basically had to eradicate traits like selfishness , arrogance and lack of empathy from a radical 's mind . 
  a good example would be someone like maajid nawaz who was a reformed radical islamist and is now one of the leading voices against radical islam . 
  i think utilizing restorative justice as rehabilitation works best . 
  empathy building is a strong element in eradicating `` isms '' and by having these radicals meet their victims you can help building a sense of empathy amongst them . 
  i said the same thing a few days before and i got responses like `` nah , it 's different in europe . 
  see ? '', 
  yep . 
  the thing about radical islamists is that their radical beliefs stems from personal behaviours like selfishness , arrogance and lack of empathy influencing their personal beliefs . 
  those are really hard to reform . 
  proving everyone that homophobia is gay as hell . 
  um , this is a repost : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ar659/austere_brand_of_islam_on_rise_in_europe_stirring/?ref=search_posts, 
  true i understand . 
  but by going against net neutrality means that the eu is choosing the wrong side of history , and when you choose the wrong side of history it produces various negative effects that will affect many european citizens . 
  the fcc 's ruling on net neutrality proves that net neutrality is the future and a necessary one . 
  people have the right to use 5 or more video streaming services . 
  i use netflix , canal + and bbc iplayer via vpn and i do n't see why one isp has to tie with one streaming service . 
  and domestically the concept of fast-lane internet is unconstitutional according to french law , since it breaches our freedom of choice as freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution of the fifth republic . 
  why ? 
  does n't the eu learn anything from america 's net neutrality ruling ? 
  why does the eu want to be in the wrong side of history for this ? 
  yup , china is one of the eu 's biggest partners . 
  china has huge economic interests and chinese students make up a huge number of french , german and british universities . 
  yes , but france is supposed to be better than malaysia !, 
  that was the point of me moving here in the first place . 
  everything here is great except for taxis , which is embarrassing . 
  if i move to a first world country and still experience shitty taxi service then what is the point ? 
  malaysians always criticize their nation with the term `` first world country , third world mentality '' which is why services like myteksi existed in the first place . 
  and yet in france apparently `` it 's okay for our taxi drivers to act like assholes with no technological advancements because uberpop is illegal anyways '' . 
  the good thing about using a decent taxi app is that i can book a taxi via an app , the taxi driver calls me to confirm , and then i can track the destination , taxi come to pick me up and i arrive to my destination via taxi . 
  there 's no harm or illegality in that . 
  hell , the korean government has their own taxi booking app . 
  come on , france can do better than this . 
  then will the french taxi system improve then ? 
  if they do n't want me to use uber , then they need to adapt to technology . 
  taxis g7 are crap . 
  give me the complete french equivalent of [ myteksi ] ( http://grabtaxi.com/myteksi/ ) or [ curb ] ( http://gocurb.com/ ) . 
  plaine et simple . 
  [ we were the first weeaboos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japonism ), 
  that too . 
  but did they also arrested the taxi drivers who `` protested '' by blocking roads and burning tires ? 
  french kids are heavily into aot and one piece though . 
  and the manga scene is still huge . 
  we gave hirohiko araki an expo at the louvre . 
  that 's what i said . 
  and i love france for its weeabooism/japonismes . 
  except france . 
  which is funny because i consider britain to be not so much of an anime-obsessed country . 
  i mean , they 're pretty much prudish and it 's not a country where i can read hentai in a metro . 
  so germans are furries , and we are weeaboos . 
  i love europe . 
  yeah when they bombed the jordanian hotel in 2005 , al-qaeda released a statement saying : `` do n't worry , those muslims we killed all went to heaven with our bullets '' fuck them . 
  these hotel workers are heroes and have shown dignity as muslims than the maniac with the gun . 
  yeah but every terrorist attack out there conducted by radical muslims will have muslims killed on the same time .
