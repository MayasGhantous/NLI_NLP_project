  at all . 
  where do these people get their assumptions of muslim customs again ? 
  but certainly spoilt though . 
  ah yes , salafism . 
  one of the worst brands of islam to ever permeate society . 
  but seriously , majority of salafists are spoilt , completely naive and expects the world to bow to them instead of a compromise . 
  if the world does n't bow to them , then they will force it with an ak-47 and cries of `` allahuakbar '' . 
  it blows my mind to see how victim complex-y some salafists can be . 
  they have no sense of empathy and understanding of the real world , and they expect to have a caliphate to represent a world based on what they want instead of what everyone wants . 
  it 's one of the reasons why i hated my college 's islamic studies class , since it 's filled with the most arrogant racist bunch of radical salafists i 've ever met . 
  humility is one of the main virtues of islam , and yet salafists are some of the most arrogant snot-nosed shits i 've ever encountered in my whole life . 
  fuck salafists and fuck them for being the biggest bunch of spoilt narcissistic cunts . 
  i wonder why ... . 
  no fucking shit !, 
  we at / r/syriancivilwar have been saying this since forever !, 
  there is a reason why there are more muslims serving in the us army than in the british armed forces . 
  better start with that . 
  for a country that loves to idolise america so much , they should also start adopting an assimilation policy in the first place . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  i 'm still shocked that a movie that our 14 year olds would regularly watch would be rated r in the us due to `` language and nudity '' . 
  nah , ramadhan is like the best time to play civilization 5 and dark souls/bloodborne . 
  gon na finish shenmue 2 now !, 
  witness me !, 
  russia is basically real life / r/topmindsofreddit, 
  not unless if you 're a ninja, 
  why not ? 
  nufasa is just next door , and the unclaimed land at your borders is filled with mufasa-friendly hyenas, 
  i did n't see nidaime sorry . 
  i only saw genshiken aka the first season of it . 
  genshiken nidaime is like the third season of it , and i heard it 's the most pandering of all seasons . 
  if you 're really interested about otaku culture , then genshiken and other anime oreimo and lucky star would be it . 
  genshiken is a great anime . 
  and yes i will fap to this . 
  no homo . 
  if jobbik joins her group then she will be branded the biggest hypocrite in europe especially since she is staunchly pro-israel . 
  it 's a circle jerk really , and a very emotional one . 
  yeah , i stopped going to those . 
  / r/syriancivilwar has better european immigration threads . 
  i get downvoted for suggesting that we should ask the americans how to deal with immigration . 
  fuck those threads . 
  ask sean parker, 
  they still are due to heavy competition from tidal and apple music . 
  according to sean parker , a startup no longer becomes a startup once he kills off the competition . 
  eritrea is a shithole and i can understand why people want to leave that place . 
   while it may be pc to say isis is n't truly islamic , the reality is that they are very islamic ... as in literalist islamic . 
  aka they 're definitely a scheme and a cult . 
  similar to evangelicals and scientology really . 
  and it strengthens my belief that cults like is/daesh and scientology are basically pyramid schemes . 
  they are literally running like a pyramid . 
  you join something that will cost your money and your life in hopes of becoming rich or go to heaven or become operating thetan 8 . 
  that 's literally how scams work . 
  well , i was from malaysia so for eid i usually return to malaysia . 
  well they were n't chanting in french so that did n't help endear the french police . 
  france & malaysia since i 'll be going back to malaysia to visit family during ramadhan & eid , i 'll be posting at least one or two malaysian news as well . 
  ** personal ** so other than watching anime like ** working ** and ** hibike euphonium ** , i 'm also watching parks and recreation season 4 . 
  i think s4 is the best season of p&r , since there 's something enjoyable about leslie knope as a character who 's trying to balance between running for city council and running the p&r department . 
  also , ** d4 ** is released on steam , and while i 'm also enjoying ** the witcher 3 ** and ** bloodborne ** it 's fun to see a game as stupid as d4 come out once in a while . 
  it 's by the guy who made the twin peaks love letter called deadly premonition and d4 takes the stupidity of deadly premonition and puts it in an episode game . 
  it 's really fun , and david young is one hell of an enjoyable character .

  the last time i posted a comment or / r/europe saying that there is no difference between joining daesh and joining a pyramid scheme or a cult , i was downvoted to hell . 
  basically this shit reinforces the belief that yeah , the islamic state attracts teenagers just like how pyramid schemes attracts bored college students or scientology attracts actors . 
  oh yeah , the `` support israel and rapture will happen '' policy . 
  yeah , germany was a democracy between 1918 to 1933 and japan had a period of democracy called `` the taisho period '' between 1915 to 1926, 
   that said i 'm tempted to suggest it was ignorance over malice ; bush did suggest ` god ' wanted him to invade iraq , suggesting he saw the prophecy of gog and magog in the region . 
  i 'm almost unable to imagine a group that stupid would 've knowing favored policies that spurred/emboldened sectarianism . 
   the differences that exist arose only because iraqis decided to engage in widespread insurgency after the mlitary had collapsed despite the us doing everything it could to win the hearts and minds of the iraqis just like they did after ww2 . 
  and ( again ) the germans and japanese chose differently from the iraqis . 
  they engaged in widespread insurgency because they do n't have fucking jobs and are being killed by shiite militias !, 
  there were protests by sunni women back in 03 ' -04 ' demanding the coalition provisional authority restore their husband 's job . 
  at the same time , sunni enclaves and districts were getting attacked by shiite militias while us forces were stationed around the green zone and forbid from engaging in sectarian battles . 
  that 's how the insurgency started . 
   a widespread popular resistance against america formed in iraq and that is the basis of isis . 
  the reaction of the iraqis is not the fault of america . 
  isis is a grass roots movement , these people have actively chosen this path . 
  a few baathists that are out of a job can not create something like isis . 
  isis is a product of america the same way obama is a product of geroge w bush , but bush is not responsible for what obama does . 
  you do know that majority of sunnis in iraq are baathists right ? 
  it 's not `` a few baathists '' , it 's a huge number , around 103,000 people . 
  many joined the baathist party not because they were loyal , but because they needed a job and a salary from saddam . 
  americans think that all baathists are dirty evil foreigners who engage in arm smuggling , and that 's a huge mistake in their part . 
  there are 86.7 million members of the chinese communist party . 
  only 20 % of the ccp joined out of loyalty whereas the rest joined because of work and business opportunities . 
  now , if america invaded chinese , took over the chinese government and forbid every ccp member from getting a job , that would pretty much turn all of china into civil war . 
  that 's what we 're talking about here . 
   american ( & coalition ) troops did not create sectarian conflict in the region . 
  it merely unleashed it , a bit early than would have naturally . 
  the regions governments were largely dictatorial regimes set-up in the early 20th century along ( somewhat ) arbitrary lines post-colonialism . 
  with france and britain winding down direct control they still wanted influence over regional powers , but without the direct cost . 
  today 's sectarianism can be traced there ; although there is a case to be made it has existed far longer than that . 
  yeah , i did say that . 
  like i 've said , iraq should not be iraq . 
  it should have been three separate nations ( a sunni hashemite kingdom , a shia nation and kurdish nation ) . 
  and while the troops did not create sectarianism , paul bremer definitely created sectarianism . 
  remember , the coalition provisional authority created policies that favours the iraqi shiites and kurds at the expense of the sunnis , and then decided to attack certain elements of shiite society because of the rise of moqtada al-sadr , leading to a three-way war between the shiites , the sunnis and the coalition . 
   the ban on public sector employment was officially rescinded in 2004 when the iraqi government became sovereign again , but the baghdad government apparently kept excluding them because of the shiite vs sunni thing . 
  which is exactly why i did not like nouri al-maliki as pm of iraq since al-maliki is basically continuing bremer 's policies but in favour of iran . 
  yeah but many nazi party members were not expelled from german society after wwii . 
  many nazi party members , soldiers and even hitler youth kids went on to live stable lives and take part in postwar germany . 
  debaathification started off trying to emulate denazification , but became completely the opposite of denazification as months go .
