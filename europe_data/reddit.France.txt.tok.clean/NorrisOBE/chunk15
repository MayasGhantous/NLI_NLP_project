  if they still refuse to reform and instead blame the west or the jews for taking away their vanity projects then fuck them i guess . 
  there are much more deserving mideast and muslim nations that can host the world cup . 
  it 's in my flair . 
  and not only that , but qatar losing the world cup would also be a big fuck you to them winning the bid to host the 2006 asian games against malaysia , who was supported by nearly every east asian country out there . 
  yeah they think winning the world cup through corruption is justifiable because `` it 's now on arab land therefore okay '' . 
  it 's mind-boggling . 
  i 've decided to visit / r/arabs and they are pissed !!!!, 
  the worst is when the same terrorists behind the luxor massacre won parliamentary seats in egypt years later . 
  reminds me of my first week moving to france : `` whoa !, 
  you 're muslim ? 
  i thought you 're chinese ! '', 
  will erdogan transform into the new god ruler of mankind ? 
  will the sdf-1 be able to transform in time ? 
  will the kurds be able to stop raoh ? 
  will goku be able to stop frieza ? 
  find out next time on turkish election z !, 
  sarkozy has been campaigning to rename l'ump into the republicains since his reelection into the head of l'ump in 2014 . 
  if the us really wants nato members to increase military budgets , then it should be essential to have a military budget that helps increases research for organisations for esa and cern . 
  why bother having a military budget that does n't help increase scientific and education standards europe-wise ? 
  our military industrial complex should not be like the americans . 
  and besides , a bloatedly huge military industrial complex led to the ridiculous militarization of the police in the us . 
  the only people who supports police militarization are people like marine le pen , and thus i do n't like the idea of increasing military budgets that helps grow a large military industrial complex . 
  ** france ** ** personal ** so i 'm currently watching working !!, 
  which is really relaxing for an anime about the japanese restaurant industry . 
  such a nice , beautiful comfy slice of life show that was adapted from a manga by karino takatsu . 
  and grats to seed team for having french fansubs that are as good as the american counterparts . 
  seed team is one of the best non-english fansub teams and it shows . 
  i really love the new hannibal episode . 
  the european setting is great , and it 's as beautiful as ever . 
  gillian anderson also stole the show , as she is fantastic and is one of the few women who manages to look better as she ages . 
  ** news ** [ daniel legrand again acquitted ] ( http://www.france24.com/fr/20150605-affaire-outreau-daniel-legrand-acquitte-jonathan-delay-myriam-badaoui-pedophilie-viol ) daniel legrand was acquitted the second time on friday as part of a new trial of the outreau case . 
  the assize court for minors in rennes followed the requisition of the advocate general . 
  [ police evacuated the migrant camp in paris ] ( http://www.france24.com/fr/20150602-camp-migrants-chapelle-paris-operation-police-evacuation-ong ) evacuation operations at the migrant camp of la chapelle boulevard in paris began on tuesday morning . 
  nearly 350 people originating in east africa lived in this camp located under the elevated subway . 
  [ l'ump now called `` republicaines '' ] ( http://www.france24.com/fr/20150529-ump-devient-officiellement-les-republicains-nicolas-sarkozy-france ) the union for a popular movement ( ump ) officially became les `` republicans '' on friday , after the vote on the renaming of the party led by nicolas sarkozy . 
  [ qatar vs philippot : the vice president of the fn at war against the emirate ] ( http://www.france24.com/fr/20150601-qatar-florian-philippot-front-national-vice-president-guerre-emirat-terrorisme-financement ) according to `` le figaro '' , qatar has filed a defamation complaint against the vice president of fn , florian philippot . 
  in several interviews , he has accused the country to fund terrorism . 
  playing the devil 's advocate here : when your experience with pop fantasy comes from 5 years of game of thrones , then you are definitely predisposed to the idea of a multiracial fantasy earth . 
  thus seeing an all-white cast has can be pretty bizarre . 
  the invasion of normandy was one of the most fascinating aspects of war imo . 
  i love learning about the concrete planning of d-day . 
  it 's wonderful and it helps me understand the importance it had on free france . 
  have these guys heard of indonesia ? 
  i ca n't wait for the confirmation that fifa has its own stockpile of nuclear weapons, 
  no doubt , especially qatar . 
  everything that has led to qatar hosting the wc has a lot to do with money and not eligibility . 
  it makes a lot of sense , especially when qatar won hosting the 2006 asian games over malaysia thanks to money . 
  we 're trying our best . 
  the reasons why i moved to france are usually due to the fact that people do n't get offended over things . 
  and now , getting offended over things is so cool right now . 
  we 're french . 
  we are not supposed to have thick skins . 
  it 's what separates us from the prudishness of the amglophonic world . 
  it 's basically that speaker things from those old record players . 
  well , the current sounds like disclosure and boddika are pretty popular in the dance scene . 
  so uk garage is now mainstream again and no longer that `` post-dubstep '' burial stuff ? 
  at least he 's not corrupt . 
  by that logic , a muslim like ice cube would have murdered the rest of the nwa by now . 
  fuck now they 're in our continent ? 
  merci . 
  considering that the british isles love a good ol' scandinavian drama , when will the scandinavians remake father ted and the wicker man into nordic thrillers ? 
  sufism is a mystical interpretation of islam that relies on the spiritual aspects muslim culture than the dogmatic and political aspects of muslim culture . 
  you know those whirling dervishes ? 
  they are sufis under the mehlevi order . 
  many famout poets in the muslim world are sufi . 
  i 'm a member of qadiriyyah wa naqshbandiyyah order which is a prominent sufi/shafi ' e in southeast asia and my dad 's family belonged to that order . 
  i 'm more interested in bektashis and their role in advancing european islam though . 
  and sufism relies on adapting with culture rather than culture adapting religion , many western sufi orders are pro-gay and they do not renounce the quran , but there are several quranists orders that rejects the hadith . 
  none of that since i follow sufi islam . 
  yeah . 
  currently reading on the mevlevi sufi order . 
  fascinating stuff . 
   why did n't you care to reply yesterday ? 
  why should i ? 
  do n't worry , i rarely get involved in drama, 
  no , i did not delete your post . 
  that 's like saying you killed someone so that you can prevent him from getting killed by other people . 
  protocols of the elders of chip and dale ? 
  whenever i come back to my hometown in malaysia , everyone knew that it was the fault of putin . 
  no doubt . 
  although some of them think that putin is a pawn of the zionists just like obama was . 
   the actual truth is that fox news was n't that far off . 
  but these camps are not located in the non-existent no-go zones and they are nothing different than the homeless areas under the bridge . 
  the anime was good but the vns were always better . 
  dude , it 's a skirt . 
  it 's like that nightmare scene from the first terminator movie where a terminator disguised as a human attacked john connor 's base . 
  [ the time an / r/european mod pm ` ed me about marine le pen winning 2017 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/plliknm.png ), 
  i have not posted in srs for 3 fucking years !, 
  dude , you want to see immaturity ? 
  a fucking 15 year old is a mod at / r/conservative but seriously . 
  how so ? 
  what makes you say that i 'm not mature enough to mod ? 
  how so ? 
  my last post in srs was 3 years ago . 
  i mostly post in / r/europe , / r/twobestfriendsplay , / r/france , / r/syriancivilwar , / r/badhistory and / r/vaporwave . 
  if you 're going to do a baseless accusation , at least do it right . 
  i do n't even post in srs anymore . 
   you did the right thing . 
  i think it 's best to watch the anime after playing the vn and i think that 's the problem . 
  they make it so accurate and loyal to vn fans that it fails to attract fans of fate/zero and those who came in cold without any knowledge of the vn .
