  it 's like the opposite of works like lotr and game of thrones that had succeeded in being adaptations that go against its own source material while staying faithful to it . 
  anyways , thanks for the recommendation !, 
  i dropped the recent anime , but i do want to play the vn . 
  the material just sucks as an anime , especially when the only vns that work as anime are slice of life harems like clannad and amagami . 
  moebius wrote icaro which was drawn by manga artist taniguchi jiro . 
  also , oban star racers was animated by japanese and french animators . 
  t411 and mononoke bt releases french fansubs for anime . 
  t411 also has french dubs . 
  they 're both the same . 
  and hey we 're french , and we 're into that japan shit for 300 years . 
  we even gave manga artists their own louvre exhibits . 
  thanks . 
  ** personal ** so i 've decided to drop fate/stay night since i was so bored with it . 
  it 's literally boring compared to fate/zero . 
  life is strange episode 3 made it the game of the year next to bloodborne . 
  the ending to episode 3 was amazing . 
  i finished macross 7 and it could 've been better . 
  i love macross and hate robotech , and macross 7 was pretty stiff compared to the liveliness of sdf-1 and plus . 
  still better than macross ii though . 
  oh , and i 've decide to get some fabrice luchini films . 
  he 's the best `` guy gets engrossed in other people 's lives '' actor ever . 
  dans la maison and gemma bovery are fantastic films . 
  i 'm going to start a marathon of working !!, 
  saisons 1 & 2 in preparation of saison 3 in july .

  [ bears repeating that the duma now resembles the corrupt , useless galactic senate from the star wars prequels and that putin literally sheev ] ( https://youtu.be/abcxyzn9xjg?t=39m37s )  but anyway , he tells the senate that the jedi ( an organization of monks that have been the guardians of peace and justice for over a thousand generations ) have suddenly decided to take over the world . 
  `` oh , and i just also happen to look and sound like a monster that wants to take over the world .

  no , no , you see , it 's the jedi that are the ones who tried to take over . 
  and that warranted them all being executed by the army that i control by myself without any kind of trial in the courts to prove what i 'm saying is true . 
  yup , we just killed them all !,

  witness !, 
  that 's why we need an eurovision for orchestras , hip-hop and rock music . 
  we will win pretty much every eurovision rap battle out there . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  so putin 's basically immortan joe ? 
  no one in france cares . 
  eurovision would have been better if there were more non-pop contestants . 
  i 'd like to see an orchestra entering eurovision , or an eurovision for orchestras , hip-hop and rock music . 
  yes but only when they resolve their conflicts with armenia and iran . 
  i also support bosnia 4 eu . 
  seriously , a decade ago i dreamed that the flag of europe was flying alongside the russian flag at the port city of vladivostok , implying that russia joined the eu . 
  all the photos of putin/medvedev and berlusconi always implied that way . 
  what a silly dream . 
  that will never happen while putin and his cronies are in charge . 
  that does not look too bad . 
  i hope it becomes a cheap alternative to touge-friendly bmws . 
  the question is : should i buy a dacia and modify it for drift racing ? 
  how does a dacia compare to cheap asian drift-friendly cars like toyota and proton ? 
  i do n't eat foie gras so that joke did n't work for me . 
  this is fucking terrible . 
  force feeding is basically torture , and the police officer should be jailed for this . 
   but anyway , he tells the reichstag that the jews ( people who have been living in europe for over a thousand generations ) have suddenly decided to take over the world . 
  `` oh , and i just also happen to look and sound like a crazy psychopath that wants to take over the world . 
  do n't mind my creepy moustache , my horribly evil-sounding voice , or terrifying face . 
  also do n't mind the fact that i 'm yelling about creating a new third reich run exclusively by me . 
  no , no , you see , it 's the jews that are the ones who tried to take over .

  yup , kinda fits,
