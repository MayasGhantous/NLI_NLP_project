  [ i 'm starting to think that the duma resembles the corrupt , useless galactic senate from the star wars prequels ] ( https://youtu.be/abcxyzn9xjg?t=39m37s )  but anyway , he tells the senate that the jedi ( an organization of monks that have been the guardians of peace and justice for over a thousand generations ) have suddenly decided to take over the world . 
  `` oh , and i just also happen to look and sound like a monster that wants to take over the world . 
  do n't mind my creepy black cloak , my horribly evil-sounding voice , or terrifying face . 
  also do n't mind the fact that i 'm yelling about creating a galactic empire run exclusively by me . 
  no , no , you see , it 's the jedi that are the ones who tried to take over . 
  and that warranted them all being executed by the army that i control by myself without any kind of trial in the courts to prove what i 'm saying is true . 
  yup , we just killed them all !, 
  including the children !, 
  and then we burned down their temple , and you 're all just gon na have to take my word for it . 
  trust me , look at my face !, 
  would this face lie to you ? 
  you see , i 've successfully eliminated the only opposition i might have had to form my own galactic empire . 
  please continue with the applause . 
  so remember to vote palpatine in the next election that will never happen . 
  because i said so . '', 
  no doubt . 
  this is a country that tries so hard to be seen as a moral virtue against homosexuality and drug use and yet it has an astounding hiv rate . 
  and they 're closing the base as us armed forces are looking at moving to kurdistan . 
  perfect timing really . 
  [ a screening scheduled for june 26 , 2010 at theater n in shibuya was canceled after staff were harassed by right-wing protesters .

  [ 45 ] another theater in tokyo and one in osaka subsequently declined to screen the film .

   probably because he is a successful armenian , and armenians are proud of him . 
  he 's also a successful frenchman , and is the most successful person in the armenian diaspora next to serj tankian and kim kardashian . 
   armenians have no cultural connection with french people like we do with russians . 
  the french-armenian university , missak manouchian , jean carzou , alice sapritch , charles aznavour , \u00c9douard balladur , michel legrand , patrick devedjian , sylvie vartan , alain prost , andr\u00e9 manoukian , vardan petrosyan , youri djorkaeff and simon abkarian would disagree with you . 
  armenia and france has the same cultural connection as armenia and russia . 
  in fact , glendale in california has more cultural connection with armenia than both france and russia combined . 
  just ask serj tankian  seriously , fuck you . 
  those people were displaced by genocide originally . 
  the vast majority of armenians who emigrate move to russia . 
  france makes an extremely small fraction percentage wise.emigration from armenia is a threat to its national security . 
  so why has n't armenia called for the 250,000 -- 750,000 estimated armenians living in france to return to armenia ? 
  if their also , we 're one of the first few european countries to recognise the armenian genocide . 
  just to let you know . 
   you 're are seriously just an idiotic pseudo-intellectual teenager from france , and you have 0 clue what you are blabbering about . 
  alignment with russia is something most armenians agree with . 
  trust me . 
   you want to ask some armenians about joining the eu ? 
  go ahead and make a thread on this forum , and see the response you get . 
  some of these guys are from armenia , visit armenia , and live in armenia . 
  [ a december 2006 public opinion poll in armenia found that eu membership would be welcomed , with 64 % out of a sample of 2,000 being in favour and only 11.8 % being against . 
  another poll conducted in the armenian capital yerevan in october 2006 suggested that `` as many as 72 % of city residents believe , with varying degrees of conviction , that their country 's future lies with the eu rather than the russian-dominated commonwealth of independent states ( cis ) .

  armenia 's former minister of foreign affairs vardan oskanyan ] ( http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/pr_05/050924_vo_masi.html ) [ hovhannes hovhannisyan said there is a quite strong opinion in armenia that the country 's future lies with europe . 
  `` there is no talk about asia , '' he said , adding that armenian society considers itself european and celebrates its european origins and values . 
  he also said armenia shares a significant history with europe because armenian comes from the same language family as many european languages .

  um , you do know that there 's a statue of charles aznavour in yerevan right ? 
  armenia in general is very much aligned with france and thus , europe in general . 
  [ 54 % of armenians support joining the eu ] ( http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/cad-51-52.pdf ) . 
  hell , would n't joining the eu be good for stopping an invasion from azerbaijan and turkey ? 
  france always wanted to build a base in armenia , and armenia joining eu+nato would be good for that . 
  and yes , armenians will be emigrating to other parts of the eu . 
  so what ? 
  we have 750k armenians living here . 
  armenians have been emigrating en masse since 1918 . 
  no one gives a shit . 
  and armenia and iran have been friends since the median empire , and [ armenia is one of the biggest endorsers of the p5 +1 deal . ] ( http://www.mediamax.am/en/news/foreignpolicy/13724/ ) . 
  the blue mosque has been preserved by iran for decades now . 
  so shut the fuck up . 
  yup . 
  like i 've said , it 's basically supported by old right-wing japanese men who wants to stick it to china and korea in terms of sea dominance . 
  whenever i go to shibuya or roppongi in tokyo there 's a black speakervan with japanese flags all over it that screams about how evil the koreans are . 
  these are the people who are leading the support for japanese whaling , and it 'll never change because the japanese right and far-right have the support of the elderly , and the elderly make up most of japanese society since japanese birth is declining due to a horrible and sexist work culture . 
  seriously , people should realize that japanese demand for whale and whale hunting is all for the sake of old japanese uyoku right-wingers who pined for the glory days of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere . 
  whale hunting is a remnant of the old japanese empire where japan ruled the seas of china . 
  people should know this . 
  it 's really unfortunate that armenia really wants to be a part of europe due to their strong relationship with france , but will forever be stuck with russia thanks to turkey and azerbaijan . 
  i can definitely see armenia going eu and nato if they have a helping hand from france and georgia , a friendly neighbour of theirs with similar eu+nato aspirations . 
  yes but they do have iran , and iran as armenia 's friend can beat the fucking shit out of azerbaijan . 
  many armenians i know want the sanctions on iran to end because armenia can then rely on iran as an ally against turkey and azerbaijan . 
  damnit i expected a fight . 
  it 's still more entertaining that mayweather-pacquiao, 
  why the fuck would anyone leave during o canada ?

  o canada , we stand on guard for thee . 
  nah , i originally came from malaysia, 
  seriously , just send these people to jail . 
  if the police gets called `` racist '' for sending these grooming gangs to hail , their response should be `` so what ? 
  racist or not , rape is still rape '' . 
  i come from a muslim country where they send rapists to jail . 
  if muslim nations in southeast asia can send their own rapists to jail without being called `` racists '' or `` self-hating muslims '' , then what 's stopping a liberal country like the uk ? 
  and this can be an opportunity to convert that same sense of survival into integration . 
  if they want to come back when the situation gets better , then good . 
  but if they want to stay , then we should try and make them stay and turn them into productive members of french society . 
  our focus should be on the ones who wants to stay . 
  hey i thought scots and french are friends ? 
  auld alliance and shit yo !, 
  well , france is a pretty big country compared to sweden and norway . 
  we can take a few more as long as they speak french , are willing to integrate into society and carry the french flag with pride . 
  it 's basically yellow peril 2.0,
