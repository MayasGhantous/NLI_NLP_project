  no , i like it because it 's a funny touching story that i can relate to . 
  when i was miserable at 21 , i took a trip to indonesia for absolutely no reason . 
  it reminds me a lot of this story . 
  have you seen thor 2 and agents of shield ? 
  daredevil is in the same quality mark as banshee ( which is also amazing ), 
  um , it 's okay ? 
  this is one of the few reasons why many of these youths went on to join daesh . 
  the insecurity and anxiety caused by their crisis of faith made them likelier to do something to prove their loyalty to their faith . 
  jesus christ calm the fuck down . 
  learn to have a fucking sense of humor . 
  you 're going full coulibaly here . 
   pretentious that word . 
  i do n't think you know what it means . 
  and besides , he gave his reasons . 
  he was 25 , working for conan o'brien and was fucking miserable . 
  he did n't have kids so he had his `` wtf i 'm doing my life '' so he went to russia because he thinks it answers that question . 
  why do n't you go ask / u/iamlouisck instead ? 
  go ahead , call him a pretentious prick for not understanding modern russia . 
  he 's not making fun of russia . 
  he 's just telling a story about being miserable working for conan o'brien , and why his miserableness led him to going to russia . 
   so i can basically go on a funeral and make fun of the crying mother who lost her sun as long i have a reason why . 
  [ that was actually in an episode of louis ck 's show ] ( https://vimeo.com/103207581 ) rip robin williams, 
    i think that if you want to make a movie about a brave young man from the poor suburbs of paris who finds god and then joins the is and has a great time fighting the unbeliever and spreading the true faith , you will have a hard time getting the public to pay for it . 
  yup . 
  there 's a reason why french action cinema is garbage since luc besson has a monopoly on the genre . 
  [ i bet you are n't familiar with louis ck 's material . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3naugcm-3tc ) this is actually less about louie poking fun at russians and more of him being miserable at 25 . 
  [ but netflix france is already making a french tv series with a french cast , french crew and a french location . 
  ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/marseille_%28s%c3%a9rie_t%c3%a9l%c3%a9vis%c3%a9e%29 ) what more do these people want ? 
  yes , because providing an easy access for users to get their content is somehow evil . 
  look , i know that netflix is evil because it 's american , but until european companies provide ease of access similar to netflix , then they should take their boos and stick it up their arse . 
  one of the best tv shows this year is marvel 's daredevil , which is only available on netflix . 
  wake me up when canalplus releases something with that same quality . 
  unfortunately yes . 
  this . 
  pegida are a fucking joke . 
  makes sense . 
  islamophobia can definitely affect liberal arab women from christian or secular backgrounds . 
  [ russia 's anti-gay law is one of my ` proudest achievements , ' claims pastor scott lively ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/24/russia-scott-lively-_n_3982608.html ), 
  well , i live in a secular country and thus , i follow secular laws called laicite regardless of my religion and thus i support gay marriage on the basis of secularism . 
  and since i studied american history , one of my favourite american politicians is keith ellison , a muslim who has campaigned for gay marriage on the basis of the us first amendment which ensures secularism in the usa . 
  also russia and korea . 
  oh , scott lively 's behind this . 
  well , fuck him and fuck everything he 's into . 
  he 's the reason behind putin 's anti-gay laws . 
  we need to grow faster !, 
  yet his drinking record made him more socialist than both mitterand and hollande combined, 
  dude , my [ hokuto shinken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3wcnwuux1w ) can still beat your power armor, 
  dude , would a french person in `` business lawyers inc. '' really vote for a bob hawke or a jose mujica ? 
  you know , after the ps shot itself on the foot by embracing third way politics and `` soft socialism '' , i 'd vote for sarkozy . 
  even if he kisses rich muslim sheiks from the uae while calling french muslim youth `` scum '' , he 's still the best choice to defeat marine le pen . 
  and also , his administration elected georges fenech , who 's pretty much the best person to run miviludes . 
  if sarkozy can get fenech back to run miviludes , then he 's got my vote . 
  if the french left needs to rebound in 2022 , they seriously need a person like jose mujica or bob hawke to run the party . 
  he 's basically a post-apocalyptic religious warlord running a secular country . 
  hell , just across the border is a post-apocalyptic wasteland . 
  he 's literally immortan joe , cesar 's legion and shin/raoh in real life . 
  my allegiance is to the khorne the reign of blood shall flow from no 10 blood for the blood god !, 
  skull for the skull throne !, 
  i 'm pretty sure they do , considering the notable catholic population of palestine, 
  just legalize marijuana already . 
  young people can become entrepreneurs and open up dispensaries with that shit . 
  and it 's an acquired skill that many marijuana-related jobs are things that only european teenagers would know ( like edible creator , concentrates processor , budtender , . etc ) . 
  and not many skilled immigrants would even be skilled in simple marijuana-related jobs . 
  seriously , if it works for colorado it can work for europe . 
  i 've seen that talk and [ the rebuttal to that talk was better ] ( http://blog.ted.com/why-democracy-still-wins-a-critique-of-eric-x-lis-a-tale-of-two-political-systems/ ) the big flaw to mr. li 's idea is china 's lack of transparency and a rising brain drain . 
  as more of the middle class demands answers when the housing bubble comes and more chinese citizens are leaving china in droves , there will be a stability crisis within the government . 
  the next change in a mainland chinese government will be democracy , and while that will decades , it will still happen . 
  china has more males than females and their constant growing middle class will definitely lead up to a democratic reform one way or another . 
  they 're a successful capitalist economy , but also a failing socialist government . 
  compare north korea to let 's say , sweden then we 'll talk . 
  and no , do not mention china . 
  china is bigger than the rest of the eu , so any comparison between china and an ant farm is pretty much void , monsieur orban . 
  wait , so the anti muslim crowd are joining with the radical islamists to stop an exhibition of a mosque ? 
  that 's the worst team up since magneto and red skull joined to stop dr.doom , to the point when marvel writers said to themselves `` why the fuck would a holocaust survivor team up with a nazi ? '', 
  some companies leave = all companies leave . 
  great argument there , kiddo, 
  yeah but we 're not talking about the economy . 
  we 're talking about treating female workers as human beings . 
  and if it 's true , who gives a fuck if they are leaving in droves ? 
  if they refuse to treat women as humans then fuck them . 
   is more of an editorial than a story . 
  is n't that the point ? 
  in general , maternity leave in america is still seen as a joke compared to france ( where i live ) and even malaysia ( where i 'm from ) . 
  what are the halftruths if i may ask ? 
  the show 's success is their main stories like the recent [ paid maternity leave in america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zihkaqx5izw ) and the [ net neutrality issue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpboeorrhyu ) i think john oliver 's humor is not really to make you laugh but to make you understand complicated subjects in the simplest terms . 
  and it 's successful . 
  ah d'accord, 
  i live in france but i 'm not french . 
  * the richer the chinese , the more irrational they become, 
  i moderated a small subreddit called / r/marvelcirclejerk which is a small yet semi-active subreddit and we managed to solve a problem involving a troll who wanted to be a moderator himself ( there is even a subreddit dedicated to him trolling other subreddits ), 
   * 500 + combined karma from any subreddits yes  * be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue yes  * have experience as a moderator ( or similar ) yes  * do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  no  * what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  +2 gmt or +8 gmt depends whether i 'm in france or in parts of asia  * what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe my favorite thing about / r/europe is the ability for all europe nations to come together and share ideas . 
  learning about europe as a whole is fascinating . 
  however , i do n't like that / r / europe can be a target of brigading . 
   * what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  follow the example of / r/syriancivilwar and make / r/europe much more relevant to the continent by having more european content and less non-european content i would also encourage more posts from other european languages and maybe create a translation team for / r/europe  * what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i am keen to engage in debate with various sides of the european political spectrum . 
  i also check in reddit every morning which makes me much more aware of the happenings within reddit than most people .
