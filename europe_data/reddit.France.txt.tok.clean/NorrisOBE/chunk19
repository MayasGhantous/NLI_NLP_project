  yeah the free french campaign of north africa do n't real . 
  paging / u/turtleeatingalderman off / r/badhistory, 
  to be fair , when these people were polled they think that state-controlled media would lead to more works of art like stalker and solaris . 
  and yet , the only things the putin-controlled media managed to create these days are russian ripoffs of how i met your mother , big bang theory and the rdj-influenced sherlock series ( which is inferior to vasily ilyanov 's portrayal of sherlock holmes ) . 
  why do they say that `` voting is haram '' when indonesia practises democracy and holds election themselves ? 
  if you 're calling voting haram , then you 're calling 200 million muslims as `` kuffars '' . 
  where 's the logic in that ? 
  and the irony is that there are like fucktons of verses in the quran saying that you should respect the law of the land regardless if it 's a muslim land or not . 
  call me a fake scotsman , but i want to know what quran they 're reading . 
  this is basically another symptom of western democracies becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  terrorists want us to feel scared , and so we make laws to make us feel more scared , and thus the terrorists win . 
  it 's like poetry , it rhymes . 
  i ca n't wait to be spied on for having the name `` mohamad '' . 
  russian `` democracy '' is a joke compared to india and south korea . 
  you 'll never see a leader like narendra modi or abdul kalam in russian politics , ever . 
  dude , are you seriously saying that a community centre run by a sufi imam who 's not affliated with the 19 sunnis who caused 9/11 would be insulting to zuftul ibis , abul k. chowdhury , khalid m. shahid , tariq amanullah , nasima h. simjee , syed abdul fatha and many more muslims who died during 9/11 ? 
  in fact , [ the pentagon has a muslim prayer room before and after 9/11 without any objection from the us army or any american politician ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/22/ar2010082202635.html ) , making the entire `` ground zero mosque '' manufactured bullshit to stir your emotions for the 2010 election . 
  in fact , america is a country that allows alabama and mississippi to call the mlk day `` the robert e. lee day '' , and yet people are much more offended by some small building a few blocks from 9/11 because it 's run by dirty , evil mooslems . 
  are you seriously comparing theo van gogh and charlie hebdo to pamela geller ? 
  nothing , but it 's texas and cruz and gohmert are just fucking crazy . 
  but why texas ? 
  why not hold this event in oklahoma ? 
  or nebraska ? 
  or west virginia ? 
  what about south dakota ? 
  the tea party in texas is literally far right . 
  [ have you seen louie gohmert ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqvfqcpyocq ) and here 's [ ted cruz getting booed for calling arab christians `` anti-semites ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2zvihacwq0 ) golden dawn ai n't got shit on this yo !!, 
  you should watch daredevil . 
  it 's on netflix france and it 's really good . 
  the founder of the group , pamela geller is literally batshit fucking insane . 
  [ she managed to make a sufi imam look like a radical salafist and people fell for her bullshit !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pamela_geller#stop_islamization_of_america ) she makes le pen look like gandhi . 
  so basically these far-right tea party texans created an event to get a reaction from a vocal minority , and they got exactly what they want . 
  seriously , are these radical terrorists really that dumb that they do n't see how this plays into the hands of the far-right ? 
  or are they willing to do exactly what the far-right wants so that they could disenfranchise more western muslims in the process ? 
  so marine le pen is literally wilson fisk ? 
  come on !, 
  of course !, 
  there is a huge correlation between the growing aggressiveness of the kremlin and the rise of the european far-right . 
  it 's the horseshoe theory in action . 
  malaysian in france here . 
  can confirm for both malaysia and france . 
  france is obvious for its immigrant communities and expat diasporas , but so is malaysia with its high expat community of europeanss , japanese and koreans in kuala lumpur/penang/kuching / langkawi and the amount of nepali , indonesian , filipino and bangladeshi workers who have integrated easily and provides a lot of the workforce here . 
  wow , the malaysian building actually looks impressive . 
  the one in shanghai 2013 was a fucking disaster, 
  [ your wish is my command ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_young_men ), 
  and jordan , lebanon , egypt , morocco , indonesia , pakistan and turkey have growing pro-salafist sentiments and are/were run by dictators like mubarak , assad , suharto , musharraf and erdogan . 
  these dictators also used jews as boogeymen to gain control of their country . 
  [ these countries also have high numbers of fighters in syria . 
  ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/isis-numbers-foreign-fighter-total-keeps-growing-n314731 ) it does n't disprove my point . 
  watch anime . 
  the worst is when the israeli right tries to use growing antisemitism in europe as a political tool . 
  like netanyahu 's sleazy visit to the synagogue in paris ( and getting booed for it ), 
  according to the logic of neo-nazis , conspiracy theorists and radical salafists , all jews support israel and control the banking industry and the idea of a jew that is either indifferent or opposed to zionism is a lie by the jews to trick the anti-jewish/zionist cause . 
  balkans have been decent examples of interfaith unity post-war . 
  `` oh my god hollande is putting a stone cold slammer on the french army ! '', 
  - jim ross, 
   he also expressed concern that russian officials do not understand how western institutions function . 
   he cites an incident in which russia 's former ambassador to nato , the nationalist deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin , was denied permission to plant poplar trees on the grounds of nato 's headquarters in brussels . 
  the russian word for poplar is `` topol , '' which also happens to be the name of russia 's topol-m intercontinental ballistic missile . 
  which is funny because russians always accuse non-russians of `` not understanding russia '' . 
  yeah , i understand the japanese work culture and the nomikais and shite . 
  i used to work in one . 
  but will japanese companies eventually adopt western ` flexible ' work standards similar to the west ? 
  wow , japan is truly trying to ease up . 
  is abenomics working ? 
  they work * hard * , but not * smart *, 
  londoners hate london just like how parisians hate paris . 
  can i pin the blame on a group that rhymes with `` bourbon gown '' ? 
  in finance they 're both the same . 
  are n't long black skirts pretty secular though ? 
  i think our educators do n't know what the fuck they 're doing . 
  project network reminds me of [ the church of scientology 's pop band ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/the-church-of-scientology-had-their-own-teen-pop-band-and-they-were-amazing ) ( and yes , that was lindsey bartilson from grounded for life ) . 
  also , vladimir putin reminded me so much of l.ron hubbard . 
  from the charismatic faux-persona ( sea captain/tiger hunter ) to the belief in celebrity worship ( tom cruise/steven seaga ) , it 's so uncanny . 
  ps : project network claims to use music and pop culture to promote conservative values and against same-sex marriage but their music sounds so fucking gay that it makes me want to marry 5 dudes from siberia . 
  hell , the guys at 8:35 looked like people my friend dated via grindr . 
  i 'm a francophile who 's actually studying in paris right now . 
  that 's just it . 
  i 'm basically using / r/europe and / r/france to fit in by trying my best in french , and immersing it with a france flag flair and attempts to improve my skills . 
  i 'm currently b1 but i still have errors in writing . 
  my biggest problem right now is identifying `` phrase-clef '' , which pisses me off as i should be really good at this . 
  so basically slavery . 
  eh , d'accord . 
  i should start buying a french keyboard after all . 
  /  bleu /  rouge le nouvelle empire du francais confirmer !, 
  so what was it ? 
  if the gulags are n't slavery then what is it ? 
  if you really want to see that , [ then you should go to pammunjeon during propaganda balloon events when north korean defectors frequently fight with far-left pro-nk south koreans . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhj4rh13eoc ), 
  i see no difference between that and holocaust deniers . 
  if you deny mass killings of millions , then fuck you . 
  in fact , just go to / r/communism and / r/socialism . 
  you even get to meet some of the worst deniers of north korean famine , the killing fields and the cultural revolution on both subreddits . 
  `` there is no genocide in bah sing se '', 
  yeah , so much for `` parti socialiste '' this `` law '' will be the deathknell of hollande 's government . 
  i bow to the caliph vanilla caramel of the delicious fenocchio caliphate . 
  is/daesh does recruitment the same way mlm/pyramid scheme companies do recruitment . 
  the reason why people join is/daesh are pretty much the same reason why people join pyramid schemes .
