  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002 ) nate silver has taught me that the american and british press lied about mitt romney running a `` stiff competition '' with barack obama . 
  this is the same bullshit with not only the fn , but currently with ukip and ted cruz . 
  i 'd love to learn finnish . 
   also people visit your country because of the beauty of paris and the riviera , the good food , good weather and the cultural sights . 
  to think that people visit france because you refuse to speak english is the most absurd thing i 've heard in a while . 
  if anything it greatly contributes to the whole `` the french are arrogant '' stereotype . 
  that 's a shallow and terrible view of tourism and visiting other cultures . 
  and besides , tourism in france is way different than tourism in scandinavia . 
  i avoid places like eiffel and louvre because tourist traps , and i prefer immersing myself in the country and meeting people , having a drink and learning to grow myself in the experience . 
  and besides , tourism in france is about exporting french culture and values . 
  people who go to france will come back with a vision and understanding of french culture and french ideas , and language is the biggest part of it . 
   whats even worse was that when i was in france and i tried to speak french to a clerk she scoffed at me . 
  she was asking who the shirt was for and i said `` pour moi '' , which apparently is wrong and should be `` a moi '' . 
  did n't laugh or correct me , just scoffed . 
  having this attitude is just idiotic if you want people to speak your language . 
  / r/thathappened i 'm sorry if that happens to you but it never happened to me . 
  but then again , i took up french back in my hometown . 
   it seems like the whole world is starting to conform to the idea of english being the lingua franca . 
  japan and korea does n't , and china is still trying to figure whether foreign nationals should learn mandarin or whether locals should learn english . 
  and besides , we are the third biggest [ centre for international education ] ( http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy-1/economic-diplomacy-foreign-trade/facts-about-france/one-figure-one-fact/article/france-is-the-3rd-most-attractive ) , which proves that the idea of `` lingua franca '' to be pointless in the age of the internet . 
   i 'm danish and if i go to barcelona or warsaw i do expect people my age to be able to speak english . 
  but if i go to barcelona i still speak spanish/catalan and the experience is much more rewarding than speaking another language . 
  when i went to japan , i speak japanese . 
  the experience was wonderful and eye-opening and it 's what tourism should be . 
   its kinda sad to see france lagging behind , and i think it might come to bite you guys in the ass . 
  that has never happened for the past 900 years . 
  as long as we get all the international students from africa and china , headquartered the large hadron collider , host cannes and win oscars , french will not face irrelevancy for another 200 years . 
  and besides , when the esa lands its first base on mars before the chinese and the americans , the first two languages spoken will be english and french . 
  [ top kek . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfumw_mf5qc ) shut up and speak french . 
  even if you suck at it . 
  learn to blend with the locals or leave . 
  look , there are a lot of english speakers in france , they just do n't want to speak english . 
  in france , speaking broken holiday french is still better than speaking english . 
  when in rome , etc. ... 
  i understand but at the same time , i am heavily disenfranchised as a result . 
  when i look at a political party , i really would love to vote for a party which endorses regulated decriminalization of drugs as a job-creation platform , seeding french it startups against current american giants and turn french culture into a foreign policy . 
  and yet , none of the political parties have such outlook . 
  apparently `` immigration '' is more important than defeating is/daesh . 
  this is like 2004 america all over again . 
   actually , it is more related to the fact that the leftists are more busy fighting themselves than the others . 
  and also fact leftist parties in france have abandonned populism in favour of third way politics which is wrong . 
  third way politics led to the iraq war , and i am confused why hollande chose the third way in favour of leftist populism . 
  the reason why syriza , podemos and the uruguayan mpp became popular is because of populism . 
  if the french left adopted radical populism similar to syriza , the left would be a dominant force which would shit marine le pen 's pantaloons . 
  i 've said this many times and i 'll say it again : portugal , uruguay , washington state , alaska and colorado understand . 
  why ca n't the rest of europe ? 
  [ marijuana use is at its higest in france ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20130529-french-europes-biggest-cannabis-users ) , and thus 95 % of violence in marseille is the cause of that . 
  and yet , [ all the major parties except for the greens ( no pun ) ] ( http://www.estrepublicain.fr/elysee-2012/2011/12/20/le-cannabis-vu-par-francois-hollande ) are still against or divided towards decriminalization and legalization , even melenchon goes `` je ne sais pas '' in regards to decriminalization and legalization . 
  hell , [ obama had to reiterate to the creator of the wire that the war on drugs ai n't working , and that full legalization will happen sooner or later ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwy79jcfhjw ) . 
  when will europe admit this ? 
  as a malaysian , this is so true it hurts . 
  thinking that france would support a `` fexit '' is delusional . 
  if marine le pen believes that france wants to exit eu , then i believe in the ability to telepathically make out with scarlett johansson . 
  may i present you one of the best documentaries of the importance of medical marijuana on children 's health : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrvxrzy1_x0, 
  and yet davuto\u011flu marched in paris . 
  `` je suis charlie '' indeed . 
  french people benefit a lot from the eu and they know it . 
  [ the bookies are never wrong ] ( http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/european-politics/french-election/winning-party ), 
  there 's 2 years left till 2017 and by that time i hope we french can wake up , see all her other policies and say `` non merci '' . 
  majority of french love the eu and the youth are all pro-marijuana . 
  she wants to leave the eu and [ turn the banlieues into the next mexico and colombia ] ( http://www.estrepublicain.fr/elysee-2012/2012/01/02/le-cannabis-vu-par-marine-le-pen ) . 
  just like how ukip and uk greens ' policies are causing a backlash right now , the same will definitely happen to le pen and the fn . 
  ask yourself : is voting for fn because of immigration really worth it ? 
  with her anti-eu , anti-immigrant and zero tolerance anti-drug policies the only jobs she 'd really bring are jobs for riot gear manufacturers like alsetex . 
  is that the future you really want ?

   immigration which is also related to `` the economy '' . 
  my point still stands . 
  i do n't see any rhyme or reason to turn france into a vichy police state because of the `` immigrants '' . 
  and i guarantee you that clamping down on immigration wo n't solve unemployment except for a few job openings for the european military industrial complex ( hi g4s !,

  `` interpretation of islam '' . 
  happy francophonie day to you too . 
  and what about qatar ? 
  yes but i do n't give a fuck about that , especially when propaganda utilizes pick and choose itself . 
  the thing though is that islam has existed for a thousand years , and thus there literally thousands of sects and followings of different interpretations of islam . 
  shias have their interpretation of islam based on ali and within that there comes a million schools of thought within shias like alevis and ismailis . 
  sunnis have their interpretation of islam and within sunni islam comes teachings like shafi'e , hanbali and salafi . 
  and then you have sufi islam which advocated for a mystical interpretation of islam . 
  and within sufism you have the bektashis and burhaniyas . 
  also , there have been many muslim societies that have coexisted with europe for 500 years . 
  the tatars , the balkans , the turkics and the hemshins haved lived with europe for so long that they should be a case study on european islam . 
  and besides , we 're fighting a propaganda war against daesh . 
  the best form of propaganda that europe can do against these social media-savvy extremists is to emulate the cia 's funding for arts and culture . 
  and what better way is to bring european culture to islam and in return , turn islam in europe into an avenue to promote european culture . 
  if the cia can defeat the soviet union by using abstract art to promote critical thinking , the we can do the same thing too . 
  seriously , i care more about winning a propaganda war than whether or not one man 's interpretation of the koran is true or not . 
  as someone living in a france and a muslim i also support this . 
  the european governments should be looking at `` cordobanizing '' islam , reforming the religion to fit european ideals against powers of the rich gulf wahhabists and salafists aiming to turn european muslims into future cannon fodder for its proxy war against the shi'ites and the hashemites .
