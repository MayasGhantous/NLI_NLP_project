  we should do this in both interior and exterior . 
  for example , i believe that mosques in europe should look to reflect european values , and thus i believe that they should be built as if they 're european buildings and not buildings funded by rich saudis . 
  i also believe that imams and ulamas should be vetted by the government , and sermons by imams should have messages that reflects european values . 
  do n't the government knew that these terrorists are actually teaching them kids how to bypass government censorship ? 
  come on , is/daesh knew how to use tor , provides their own vpns/proxies and have fucktons of manuals on censorship bypass and server location . 
  a censorship war is a losing game for the west . 
   why does the u.s. need a big war in europe ? 
  because the us helped us in wwii and we provide them with marion cotillard in return to protect our ass ? 
  seriously , this question is as stupid as `` why should dale cooper solve the murder of laura palmer ? '', 
  i always believe that bosnia and albania are much better `` muslim countries '' than turkey when it comes to european integration . 
  both bosnia and albania are members of the organization of islamic co-operation ( oic ) , but at the same time both countris have leaders with higher european and western ambitions than turkey . 
  having bosnia and albania in the eu would allow for the eu to be involved in the global halal trade and islamic finance , both of which needs heavy regulation by brussels . 
  yeah that 's a great idea until muhammad al-scofield has a henna painting of the prison at the back . 
  speaking of which , prison break went to shit in season 2 . 
  i do n't see any rhyme or reason to center a season of `` prison break '' being outside of a prison . 
  protocols of the elders of ikea, 
  um , i did n't say that . 
  i also do n't like huffpo for its anti-vaccine stance too you know . 
  this . 
  i 'm sick of / r/europe linking to hack american right-wing sites . 
  i mean , the british has schooled american redditors for linking to the daily mail , and yet the opposite is okay for some reason . 
  the decadent homo muslim jewish neo-nazi svoboda eu imperialist west from dagestan/chechnya . 
  so russia is welcome to the nhk ? 
  reality is an invention of the eu gay jewish muslim nazis from dagestan . 
  no need to follow , [ just look at it !,

  [ k ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bad_religion/comments/2yn8j4/reuropean_and_rwhiterights_presents_muslims_are/ ), 
  you know , as a sufi muslim i was called an islamophobe for rejecting salafism . 
  fuck that shit . 
  there 's actual islamophobia like [ barack obama is a muslim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barack_obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories ) , [ the national front hates kebabs ] ( http://onislam.net/english/news/europe/479047-french-far-right-warn-of-kebab-threat.html ) or [ florida man threatens principal after learning that his daughter learns about muslims in school ] ( http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/story/27151002/marine ) , and then there 's actual debate about the role of the various sects of islam and muslims in western society . 
  the latter is not islamophobic and it 's actually a serious thing that muslims should seriously debate each other on . 
  look , at least muslims are n't as litigious as scientologists and jehovah 's witnesses , and going around calling someone with a question about muslims as an `` islamophobe '' will make the term islamophobia as meaningless as `` sjws '' , `` cultural marxists '' and `` hipsters '' . 
  yeah , and the us put a man on the moon while giving birth to the kfc double down aka the worst edible thing ever made . 
  but at least the dumbest american tea partier can understand the concept of `` canada '' and `` mexico '' . 
  the average pro-putin russian vatnik could n't even understand the concept of ukraine 's sovereignity . 
  and at least the us government would not invade tijuana and cancun over the pretense of `` protecting american tourists '' or some dumb shit . 
  see ? 
  i can do whataboutism too you know !, 
  juncker 's response : `` because fuck you that 's why '', 
  which is funny because germans in general has no love for krautrock and tends to love shit schlager music . 
  as someone living in france i strongly believed that no one in france would claim to speak english until they go outside france or francophone countries . 
  if there are muslims want to leave france because of our laws and move to syria , let them . 
  they shall never return . 
  if there are jews want to leave france because of our laws and move to israel , let them . 
  they shall never return . 
  we have muslims and jews who are integrated into french society and we should pay more attention to making them into role models for future generations . 
  why should we give a fuck what about a bunch of whiny radicals who moan about not being able to wear a burqa ? 
  no she does n't . 
  http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/european-politics/french-election/winning-party second place of course , but not first place . 
  there 's a higher chance that she will say something completely stupid or bizarre that will completely made voters reconsider her . 
  ps : [ madam hydra herself was from hungary ] ( http://marvel.wikia.com/ophelia_sarkissian_%28earth-616%29 ), 
  but clarion is clearly pushing an agenda . 
  i do n't mind if you also post a legitimate source with the same survey . 
  i just do n't understand why putin would bother creating a propaganda platform with news networks when he could instead export russian culture to the world 24/7 . 
  japan and korea won everyone 's hearts and minds without even focusing on propaganda news stations . 
  all they did was exporting k-pop , korean dramas , japanese food and anime and now everyone loves them . 
  they do n't need to focus on criticizing north korea and china 24/7 via nhk world and kbs world , all they need was to make every teenager listen to girls generation , make every boy watch one piece and make every housewife watch coffee prince and voila !, 
  instant adoration worldwide !, 
  south korean pop culture exports have become a huge part of foreign policy , and they even believe in doing things like smuggling korean dramas to north korea and having psy perform gangnam style for president obama as a way to for the world to love south korea . 
  and it worked . 
  i do n't see any reason for putin to send his troops to ukraine or call europeans `` nazis '' on a news network when he could be exporting the russian sherlock holmes serials or a game of thrones-like tv adaptation of war & peace to european televisions . 
  hell , britain loves denmark for all the scandinavian thrillers played on british tv . 
  why not putin ? 
  if he truly wants to bet on economic recovery then why not legalize marijuana so that everyone in the banlieues can get a job ? 
  i just really do n't get it . 
  europe is the continent with the fastest internet combined . 
  net neutrality allows for the use of fast internet to be on every internet service from websites to streaming services and voip . 
  revoking net neutrality would make fast internet useless . 
  why would you want a 1gbps internet where you can only surf google with high speeds , but get throttled to 218kbps for netflix because your cable provider only supports canal + 's streaming service ? 
  that should not happen . 
  our internet experience should not be as awful as our satellite/cable tv experience . 
  i really doubt the fn could actually win . 
  as a nate silver trust bookie , [ the chances of fn actually winning are not that much . 
  ] ( http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/european-politics/french-election/winning-party ) in politics , the bookies are always right . 
  yeah , it 's only two years and shit , anything can happen within 2 years from now that could rebound hollande for some fucking reason . 
  why the fuck does every poll say that national front is winning and yet i have yet to met a single fn supporter everywhere i go ? 
  am i doing it wrong ? 
  are the fn like nickelback where they keep selling records despite not knowing a single fan or some shit ? 
  do fn supporters live in some cave where they can only go outside when the `` polls '' are open or something ? 
  if america can enact net neutrality , so can europe . 
  seriously , russia has gone beyond poe 's law , godwin 's law , smileyman 's law and dunning kruger effect so bad . 
  dude [ i just said that yesterday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0afj/plans_for_an_islamic_university_are_fueling/cp55iye ) !, 
  having studied american history and taken us history exam back in international school , i am constantly fascinated with american civil war history but ever since subscribing to / r/badhistory i 've been more fascinated with the hilarious inaccurate `` lost cause '' arguments for the civil war stating that secession was a state 's rights and had `` nothing to do with slavery '' despite having total proof that it does . 
  um , what is so heritage about blocking some video of a german girl covering katy perry ? 
  look , k-pop won against j-pop because of unrestricted access to their music videos on youtube . 
  gangnam style , fantastic baby and gee were popular because everyone can watch the video without any restrictions whatsoever . 
  it has now become a south korean government policy to promote `` korean culture without any political , economic and social restrictions '' . 
  do n't people realize how beneficial is unrestricted access to culture towards foreign policy ? 
  and considering the speed of romanian internet , i really want romania to be the eu hub for e-sports and fgc . 
  the reason why korea is a starcraft hub is because of fast internet , and high-speed broadband helped japanese arcades foster daigo and justin wong . 
  fuck , i do n't mind if romanians start winning mlg , evo and the international due to the speed of its internet . 
  with lol and dota2 free , i do n't see why romania has n't jumped in on e-sports train . 
  yeah . 
  they even set up their own social media sites according to raqqa_sl, 
   i got a bit off put too when they agree with `` you wo n't win a war with weapons . 
  the war will be won with culture , science and intelligence . '', 
  what is this war they are referring to ? 
  war on isis ? 
  war on the west ? 
  well , here 's the thing : europe is challenged by a propaganda war from is/daesh .
