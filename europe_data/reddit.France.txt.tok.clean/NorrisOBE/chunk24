  everyone was preparing for final exams , glastonbury , eid and ibiza during that time , and you want to them to carry an extra baggage by having them decide on britain 's future with the eu ? 
  are you fucking stupid ? 
  okay , and ? 
  public transport in nyc and singapore also looks like this too you know . 
  [ considering how russians regret fall of communism and wishes for its return ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=considering+how+russians+regret+fall+of+communism&amp;rlz=1c1rlns_enmy717my717&amp;oq=considering+how+russians+regret+fall+of+communism&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) , i will not be surprised if it goes back to some form of socialism one way or another . 
  after jerry smith pluto shit like `` brexit means brexit '' it 's actually nice that the eu does the opposite of that instead . 
  do these fucks ever read the constitution ? 
  ever since the civil war and texas v. white , it 's technically impossible to secede from the union unless if it 's brought to the supreme court ( which the sc wo n't rule in favour of due to half of sc including gorsuch being constitutional literalists ) . 
  like i 've said : the cuntiest cunt to ever cunt . 
  seriously , i 'm getting sick and tired of brexflakes being the first commenters to every fucking brexit post in / r/europe trying to damage control by saying `` do n't worry , everything will be fine '' . 
  you and david cameron fucking started it you fucking cunts !, 
  take some fucking responsibility for once !, 
  do n't bother . 
  he 's a ukpol who says shit like `` english is and will remain the language of choice for civilised people . '', 
  yeah but muh strong russia and western degeneracy !!!, 
  yeah , he basically lied to maajid nawaz , mo ansar and the bbc by claiming to have left the edl and its ideology only to return to the ideology months later . 
  apparently he misses the fame he gets from hating muslims . 
  he 's a fucking liar and a psychopath . 
  how dare they !, 
  triumph of the will is a masterpiece !, 
  the thing though is that a lot of western tankies/pro-commies are still defending north korea as if it 's a communist state . 
  like alejandro cao de benos i can definitely see russia heading the way to communism , but it 'll end up way more conservative than its current orthodox christian mode . 
  have you read the handmaid 's tale ? 
  well , it 's basically that but replace gilead with russia , christianity with state communism , serena joy with natalia poklonskaya but maintain the same story themes ( homophobia , anti-women , militant conservatism , slavery , falling birthrates , high drug use , anti-intellectualism , censorship against pornography by christians and social justice warriors , separation of women from men ) and you 'll basically see russia within the next 20 years . 
  there 's diff . 
  types of communism the same way there 's diff . 
  types of libertarianism . 
  this is like reverse animal farm where a communist society turned capitalist is slowly creeping back to communism . 
  and it 's not even the communist of russia 's past . 
  it 's basically communism but with the orthodox church meets north korea instead of stalinism or leninism . 
  oh come on , let 's not get into this `` who started it '' shit . 
  the settlements are still fucking illegal regardless . 
  it only exists for netanyahu to get new voting blocs . 
  sure , if the settlements are geographically close to each other but instead it 's cluttered out of spite, 
  and this will ensure new settlements and thus , more netanyahu supporters for the next decade . 
  the fact that public broadcasters like the bbc rely too much on ratings is the most infuriating . 
  they 're meant to serve `` the public '' , not `` the most tuned-in public '', 
  well it basically reinforces the `` establishment vs. people '' message by making a mostly leave audience up against remain speakers . 
  also , the guest list has been fucking shite for the past few years . 
  nigel farage and diane abbott has more appearances than tim farron , and you get melanie phillips on qt calling global warming a `` scam '' whereas actual climate scientists like brian cox never got invited on question time . 
  in fact , [ he was asked to appear in australian question time ( q&a ) instead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jguarswdcrm ) and i consider that to be a fucking disgrace on bbc 's part . 
  he had to travel from the uk to australia just to discuss global warming while his own countrymen ditched him in favour of twats like melanie phillips . 
  hell , fucking l'emission politique is much better than question time . 
  at least the audience and guests in l'emission politique are not killing my brain cells . 
  when christine angot debated francois fillion , it does n't feel like idiocracy at least . 
  speaking of which , australia 's q&a is basically question time would 've been if it was actually good . 
  [ look at their recent episodes ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/past-programs-by-date.htm ) . 
  really good guests , with a really good audience , and they have themed episodes that brings guests from around the world who fit the criteria . 
  they brought in brian cox for global warming , they brought in naomi klein to discuss women 's issues , etc. 
  whereas question time has been nothing but shitty guests like diane abbott and nigel farage over and over again . 
  in fact , just rename question time as `` the diane and nigel show '' already if they keep rotating the same guests over and over again . 
  i think the jeremy paxman newsnight episode he did on brussels ahead of brexit was the most smug , condescending piece ever in european television . 
  it says a lot about the bbc in the lead up to brexit . 
  also , let 's not forget that question time has been nothing but `` fuck eu !, 
  fuck scotland !, 
  fuck ireland !, 
  reeeeee '' every time since 23rd june . 
  i stopped watching question time because i felt like watching the same episode every week . 
  that 's a nice conservative orthodox utopia you got there . 
  more like a growing anti-intellectual strain caused by a conspiracy theory culture , cognitive dissonance within anglophone politics and a disregard for humanities education . 
  as old people start reading more breitbart and infowars and more young people adopt a stem-esque circlejerk attitude on the internet in disregard for fields like psychology , philosophy , economics , history and even actual stem , a kneejerk anti-intellectual culture was formed where the most simplistic solution that benefits a certain group is accepted in favour of a nuanced solution that benefits everyone . 
  that 's why in the age of the internet you have [ sportsmen who believe in flat earth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtahjp42gjy ) , [ people believing that john podesta performed pedophilia in a pizza shop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfxwxnitf_y ) , [ people believing that voting leave will fund 350 million pounds for the nhs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ktoje6wqa ) , [ jontron using `` gene pool '' to justify against american values ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rqa9gzprqm ) and [ that sandy hook shootings were an inside job ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzmtywvvnq4 ) . 
  there are people who want simplistic answers for everything and disregard nuance . 
  that 's why they voted trump and got brexit . 
  it 's simple as `` maga '' and `` leave the eu '' . 
  illusion of simplicity is destroying the west . 
  looks like the fn vault is low on cash today ... 
  jesus christ this is starting to resemble north korean propaganda . 
  sometimes you meme too much it might end up becoming the president . 
  http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/shaq-believer-kyrie-irving-flat-earth-theory-article-1.3002720 https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/25/bob-rapper-flat-earth-twitter, 
  no shit . 
  the moment any big individual or movement advocates a dumb position , humanity gets fucked by 2 percent . 
  look at the normalization of the flat earth movement after support by nba 's kyrie irving and rapper b.o.b. 
  are these teachers and professors tenured ? 
  if so , what ? 
  if even tenured teachers get affected , then pretty much no one is safe in russia . 
  it just proves it . 
  in a free society , academic tenure is made to protect teachers and professors against things like these . 
   although it should be noted that only 1 % of russian hiv infections spread by homosexual contact , the vast majority is linked to intravenous drug abuse . 
  which pretty much outlined the hypocrisy of russian moral pandering . 
  honestly , russia has many issues and each issue can cripple russian society and government to where it can be a propaganda ammo for the eu . 
  i mean , i ca n't think of a single eu member with hiv and krokodil epidemic as high as russia . 
  every single anti-western point can be countered with `` and you guys are getting infected with hiv '' . 
  the idea that a country with high hiv rates can accuse the west of `` homosexual degeneracy '' is the most ironic shit in the yet and yet western countries led it slide . 
  what a fucking joke the eu is . 
  macron was seen as the most realistic candidate in comparison to hamon who 's unrealistically optimistic , m\u00e9lenchon who 's very naive geopolitically , fillon who 's seen as a thatcher wannabe and le pen who 's banking too much on trump and brexit, 
  number 1 is so obvious because monica bellucci still looks great . 
   thinking this is a german/japanese axis agaibst ametica ? 
  lol i think you had a stroke, 
  pretty much . 
  if i had to choose between anita sarkeesian , louise mench and tomi lahren i 'd go for a revolver , really . 
  i disagree . 
  she 's really pretty , like `` about to get famous '' porn star pretty . 
  yeah there 's a mantra of `` do n't put your dick in crazy '', 
  i live in malaysia and a lot of remnants of the portugese empire still reigned in malacca . 
  in fact , malacca is one of the most unique places in asia imo . 
  i mean , it has a combination of [ portugese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_famosa ) , [ chinese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kampung_hulu_mosque ) , [ dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stadthuys ) , [ french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_st._francis_xavier,_malacca_city ) and [ british ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malacca_light ) architecture all over the city and the entire city became a unesco world heritage as a result . 
  wow , march 30th is my birthday . 
  americans do n't even understand their own freedom of speech . 
  the first amendment protects the citizens from the actions of the government .
