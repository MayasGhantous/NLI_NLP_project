  speaking of sovereignity , everytime the leavers talk about ` sovereignity ' being a main reason and not immigration , it reminds me of lost cause neo-confederates claiming that the american civil war was about ` secession ' and ` state 's rights ' instead of slavery . 
  if that 's the case , then why do n't they do that in 2015 ? 
  the uniform of choice when visiting poland , sudetenland or austria, 
  eh , [ wilders just wants to learn from the best ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/24/north-korea-christian-exe_n_244340.html ), 
  its a bold strategy cotton , lets see if it pays off, 
  not so fast !, 
  kevin o'leary is just lurking around the corner . 
  interesting since daesh is losing ground in both syria and iraq . 
  seems like jabhat al-nusra and other jihadist groups are picking up where daesh left them . 
  but more talent though . 
  dj mehdi ( rip ) , sebastian and dimitri from paris does work that blows the shit out of guetta . 
  there are tonnes of better french house music producers than guetta though, 
  fuck david guetta . 
  he 's not even a dj . 
  he just puts on a premixed playlist and does jesus poses set to some shit chainsmokers remix . 
  this . 
  looks like i 'm the hipster in this situation . 
  i 've studied in europe before it was cool to do so . 
  ( i 'm still planning to go back though ) . 
  looks like you need to go to college because your english is pretty bad . 
  nah , thaksin shinawatra and silvio berlusconi were the ultimate proto-trump . 
  the columbus dispatch one is conservative . 
  unless if you consider [ ben garrison ] ( http://grrrgraphics.com/index.html ) ( nsfw ) to be the true conservative cartoonist of your liking . 
  this . 
  trump praised erdogan after the `` coup '' last year, 
  jesus , this is ottoman level dictatorshit right here . 
  `` it 's okay when we do it '' - the logic of these people, 
  i can read italian but the only thing i can say is `` ma porco '', 
   then , allowing boxing and forbidding mma would be nuts . 
  boxing has a way worse track record ruining people 's health , mostly due to those ridiculous gloves which are designed to maximise knockouts . 
  this , boxing has a way worse track record with things like chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( cte ) than mma . 
  hell , if oj simpson died and was revealed to have cte i wonder if germany would ban german bowl as a result . 
  i do n't know . 
  i find jogging a fine addition to french dietary and lifestyle habits . 
  if everyone in france added jogging and/or exercising into their daily lifestyle and dietary habits , they would be considered the healthiest people in the world . 
  the french would be considered superhumans adding exercise and jogging to the healthy diet and lifestyle . 
  i can concur . 
  gyms are kind of pricey in france , and i noticed back in asia that the cheaper gyms are mma-related , and mma is not legal to practice in france . 
  but jogging is definitely catching on in france , with marathon events like schneider electric marathon popularizing the running movement ( eventhough the winners of these events are always kenyans ) . 
  yeah , it 's kind of weird how france is filled with beautiful parks and garden yet lacks in the running/jogging side of things unlike the states where central park in nyc and golden gate park in sf are associated with joggers . 
  malay speaker here . 
  it 's either perancis or peranchis . 
  i do n't know why though . 
  it 's more likely due to the confusion caused by the switch from arabic script to roman script in the 20th century alongside the `` bahasa baku '' movement in the 1980s . 
  [ i just ca n't stop listening to paname by leo ferre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgsbhstqqtc ) another great singer introduced to paris by edith piaf . 
  actually it was . 
  slavery was recognized as a crime against humanity when the british abolished it . 
  hell , reverend lovejoy in 1847 was murdered just for stating that slavery was a crime . 
  in fact , one of the causes of the civil war was to recognize slavery as a crime in the western states of the us in order to prevent the spread of slavery to the west of the country . 
  because an honest politician can rule out ridiculous expectations from the public that the voters ca n't achieve . 
  the problem modern leaders like obama , hollande and trudeau were that they set out ridiculous expectations by the voters only to have the voters disappointed . 
  see obamacare , hollande 's labour reforms , trudeau 's electoral reform pledge . 
  instead of being honest , they give out ridiculous promises and it blew in their voters ' faces . 
  the same thing happened with right wing leaders like trump and may especially with trump 's obamacare repeal pledge and may 's frustrations with brexit . 
  as john f. kennedy once said : `` ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country '' kennedy did not promise anything at all . 
  if that 's the case then is lincoln stupid for enacting the emancipation proclamation ? 
  hedy lamarr : `` so what 's your country known for ? '', 
  sweden : `` rape , abba , ikea and rape '' hedy lamarr : `` you 've said rape twice '' sweden : `` i like rape '', 
  if anything , macron does resemble an air of kennedy ( also good looking ) and he has resemblance politically to d'estaing and mitterand , two of the most consequential presidents in contemporary france . 
  also , he seems to be very honest about his neoliberalism which is a huge difference to ps ' sham shift to neoliberalism that has plagued its party and affected hamon 's campaign . 
  and such air of honesty is refreshing after a year of `` he/she did not mean it '' talk by trump , may and farage . 
  also , this quote :  the rally went ahead all the same . 
  mr macron told the audience that he was `` sorry '' if he had `` wounded '' anybody , but that france needed to confront all sides of its history . 
  this reminded me of [ a speech by barack obama in 2008 ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=88478467 ) after he was accused by the clinton campaighn of having been to reverend wright 's sermons :  understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point . 
  as william faulkner once wrote , `` the past is n't dead and buried . 
  in fact , it is n't even past . '', 
  we do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country . 
  but we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the african-american community and the larger american community today can be traced directly to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow . 
  why ? 
  she has to revise the bill in order to lessen any potential damage to eu migrants and eu-based businesses in the uk . 
  all we need is him having studied engineering and we get a [ salem 's hypothesis ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/salem_hypothesis ) bingo !, 
  is n't that the point ? 
  the growth of romania in the last decade has accelerated a demand for romanians in the global job market . 
  then why not just ... not say it ? 
  then why say it ? 
  `` half of romania '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  romania is home to [ eli research center ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extreme_light_infrastructure ) . 
  it 's also home to [ one of the fastest internet connections in the world ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-city-comes-out-first-in-the-world-in-internet-download-speed-ranking/103102/ ) who the fuck wants to shut doors to people who are able to research on lasers and maintain fast internet ? 
  i know , `` gypsies and shit '' but i 'd rather buy broadband subscription from a romanian isp than from bt . 
  [ hell , there 's a huge demand for romanians in it ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/article/it-outsourcing-as-romania-vies-to-be-the-new-india-can-the-country-keep-up/ ) and may 's cabinet uses romania to justify suspension of eu citizen rights ? 
  this is basically a combination of xenophobia , europhobia , globalphobia and technophobia that is sweeping the uk and not only that , it 's out of touch because romania today is not romania of the 1980s . 
  it 's no doubt that outside forces helped in brexit in both sides of the spectrum . 
  it depends on what their goal is . 
  robert mercer supports brexit because he is heavily linked with the rees-moog side of the tories , whereas citibank and all the bankers supported remain because of their links with european banks . 
  the truth is that what is more disappointing is what 's happening after brexit . 
  theresa may went from a remainer to a brexiter because [ she saw potential in privatisation of british government services in an eu-free britain ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-us-trade-deal-donald-trump-theresa-may-nhs-privatised-food-standards-beef-chicken-a7545536.html ) . 
  and it does n't help that the british negotiation side of brexit are not bringing confidence and assurances in brexit . 
  and because of this , [ people are now starting to support staying in the eu ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-poll-majority-uk-remain-eu-theresa-may-article-50-second-referendum-latest-a7395811.html ) because they 'd rather not want to live in a uk without the nhs and the echr . 
  this is the reason why aspiring diplomats and politicians should graduate in data analytics and geopolitics than political science and economics . 
  knowledge in analytics and/or data manipulation is the key to winning elections these days . 
   milo was kiddie-fiddled by a priest as a kid , this has probably affected his views on this issue . 
  even so , they will never `` justify '' it . 
  child abuse victims who end up being child abusers ( like paul bonacci ) would do it due to psychological trauma or peer pressure . 
  they will never `` justify '' their actions . 
  and milo is no paul bonacci . 
  goodbye milo . 
  we 'll never miss you . 
  actually obama , clinton and bush tried their hardest to have a mostly smooth and coherent foreign policy in which the departments involve can agree on a principle . 
  trump 's admin is n't even trying .
