  to have a president paying lip service to russia while mattis and pence is reaffirming its support for nato and the eu is not good foreign policy . 
  donald trump will say anything from three of his competing advisors . 
  this is definitely the words of secretary mattis , whereas his anti-eu sentiments all came from flynn , tillerson and bannon . 
  it 's literally the apprentice , where competing departments try and gain trump 's ear on foreign policy . 
  if that 's the case then it 's a fucking terrible fashion statement unless if you 're doing naruto or any ninja cosplay . 
  their logic is that the more they spend on eu money the more they can bleed the eu dry and then blame it on the eu . 
  macron 's rebounding i see . 
  good !, 
  wear a head scarfs or veils . 
  that 's it . 
  `` aurat '' as they call it does n't require you to cover your face . 
  niqabs are what people wear to prevent sand storms , not a religious obligation . 
  you do n't have to wear a niqab outside the gulf . 
  a hijab is fine . 
  there is absolutely nothing , nothing in islam that requires you to wear a niqab . 
  [ hell , the leading islamic university of the world bans niqabs ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/6262819/egypt-purges-niqab-from-schools-and-colleges.html ) . 
  there is no reason to wear it outside the gulf . 
  dude , this has been a thing since the 1980s . 
  a lot of brits involved in tech like jony ive and tim berners lee live in the us . 
  le pen and fillon are also advocating george w.bush / mike pence christian neoliberalism you know . 
  not europe-related, 
  not europe-related . 
  [ the last two polls show ] ( http://cdn-new-parismatch.ladmedia.fr/var/ifop/21-02-2017.pdf ) [ that she still has to struggle in the second round ] ( http://elabe.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/21022017bfmtv_lexpress_intentions-de-vote-presidentielles-vague-2.pdf ) i 'm not saying that she could n't win , and i do think that she would win . 
  but she also has to curry favour with second round voters too and we do n't know how she 's going to do that . 
  prove to me that she can win the second round , thanks . 
  i 've yet to see evidence for it . 
  should n't nigeria worry more about the chinese than the french ? 
  also , francophone countries like senegal did more contribution to the ecowas intervention in gambia than nigeria did . 
  maybe you should focus more on jammeh 's fuckup than france coming for your sorry ass . 
  honestly what matters is the second round . 
  and both macron and fillon still has time to rebound , but hamon is trying to keep the momentum going eventhough he still lacks a chance to enter second round . 
  [ speaking of tucker carlson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afqfb5ypdze ), 
  well , the overseas campuses will definitely be private in comparison to their local counterparts . 
  sorbonne-abu dhabi is a private university instead of a public one . 
  only francophone students will get public fees whereas local and international non-francophone students get private fees . 
  another approach is to do a joint campus with local universities like [ the international university of malaya-wales ] ( http://iumw.edu.my/ ) and [ l'universite du science et technologie du hanoi ] ( http://www.usth.edu.vn/fr/programusth/programmefrancais/programme-francais-100.html ), 
  so basically allowing upper-class gentrification then ? 
  i can see upper class real estate developers coming in and gentrify and/or demolish any middle and lower class neighbourhood just to `` stop a muslim-majority neighborhood '' . 
  it happened in nyc and it 's [ now happening in vancouver ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/vancouver-housing-crisis-prompts-dramatic-rethink/article32047592/ ) . 
  british universities have been doing overseas campuses for decades . 
  there are british universities here in malaysia like newcastle uni , international university of malaysia-wales and nottingham . 
  i think french universities should do the same thing too . 
  sorbonne has a campus in abu-dhabi which is doing well but has received certain controversies over the location . 
  what the fuck happened last night in sweden ? 
  like , the only swedish thing i can think of last night was me ordering kebab pizza . 
  what did he mean by this ? 
  yup , it 's basically the apprentice . 
  me too . 
  but it 's trump 's strategy . 
  he wants to irritate the people he despises until they give him what he wants . 
  which is ironic since he gets really triggered by people irritating him to the point where he leaves them alone , like that scottish farmer michael forbes . 
  um , anime is pretty big in [ france ] ( https://youtu.be/iag8nc3f0uc?t=3m54s ) and italy . 
  hell , [ most european footballers were raised with captain tsubasa ] ( http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b00103/ ), 
  honestly if i 'm a rich motherfucker my dream is to literally build a fairy tale castle on the top of a mountain . 
  as a muslim , i find this to be fabulous . 
  france is the only country where i can read hentai in public . 
  i ca n't even do that in japan . 
  that 's why i love france so fucking much . 
   you 're playing tricks on yourself - the muslim peoples are some of the dumbest people on the planet and have virtually zero science/tech development at home . 
  tell that to muhammed yunus , jawed karim , abdul kalam , abdus salam and reddit 's favourite , salman khan . 
  you better stop using the khan academy if you think all 1.6 bilion muslims are stupid . 
  hell , better stop using youtube too . 
  seriously , i ca n't believe dan franck blew it . 
  love your india-hating username . 
  should 've added `` pajeet '' into it . 
  i did n't say he was from the middle east . 
  bangladesh is not the middle east . 
  if that 's the case , then the solution is to end the syrian civil war . 
  [ yeah , thsee guys are such dirty muslims ] ( http://www.sikhsiyasat.net/wp-content/uploads/dscf5186.jpg ) / s, 
  [ jawed karim ( bengali : \u099c\u09be\u0993\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u09a6 \u0995\u09b0\u09bf\u09ae ) was born in merseburg , east germany in 1979 . 
  his father , naimul karim , is a muslim bangladeshi who works as a researcher at 3m and his mother , christine , is a german scientist of biochemistry at the university of minnesota . 
  he crossed the old east-west german border with his family in 1981 and grew up in neuss , west germany , after which he moved with his family to saint paul , minnesota in 1992 . 
  while studying at the university of illinois , department of computer science , he decided to leave before graduation to become an early employee of paypal . 
  ] ( http://real-leaders.com/jawed-karim-co-founder-youtube/ ), 
  [ one of youtube 's main creators was a german-bangladeshi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jawed_karim ), 
  that would 've been the case if tech companies [ were n't protesting trump 's ban ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14426550/silicon-valley-trump-immigration-response ), 
  sectors like science and technology rely on immigrants , and there 's a lot of it graduates from bangladesh and iran who work on these fields . 
  that 's why trump 's ban was heavily opposed by google , tesla and apple as some of their top employees were from countries like iran . 
  and eu ministers like to pay lip service about [ becoming the next silicon valley ] ( https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/europe-is-poised-to-give-silicon-valley-a-run-for-its-money-argues-a-new-persuasive-report/ ) and yet many of their citizens believe in the exact opposite of this . 
  it 's absurd . 
  and yet europe still dreams of overtaking the states and china in various sectors . 
  edit : i love all the triggered right-wing trolls and racists here . 
  go ahead , downvote me and call muslims as inferior stupid people , you fuckers . 
  also a hilariously terrible netflix series . 
  i ca n't wait for the gendarme to sing `` le chant des cohortes '' everyday / s, 
  it 's creepy how `` marechal , nous voila '' sounds like horst wessel lied and the north korean anthem . 
  it 'd have been doing fine if the tories were n't looking at trying to [ privatise the nhs ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-privatisation-charges-professionals-in-house-agency-a7426966.html ) , [ leaving the echr ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-campaign-leave-european-convention-on-human-rights-2020-general-election-brexit-a7499951.html ) and implementing both [ snoopers charter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/draft_communications_data_bill ) and [ anti-whistleblowing laws ] ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170213/08484736698/after-passing-worst-surveillance-law-democracy-uk-now-proposes-worst-anti-whistleblowing-law.shtml ) the only recent why a remainer like theresa may is pushing for a hard red white blue brexit means brexit is because she sees brexit as an opportunity for privatisation of services and anti-privacy laws . 
  they 'll definitely blame the eu when aliens come to invade . 
  `` it 's those brussels eurocrats who caused the zargonian invasion , i tell you ! '', 
  yeah but there is no boogeyman like the kurds that will justify a nostalgic ottoman islamism in france . 
  yeah but turkey is just next door to syria and turkey has an active islamist party ruling the government . 
  also , they 'd vote for anyone strongly anti-kurd and erdogan is the most anti-kurd of them all . 
  there 's nothing like that in france . 
  assimilation does n't mean giving up culture . 
  it 's integrating it . 
  france works the same way america works . 
  armenian and pre-independence algerian cultures have integrated successfully into french culture . 
  nothing would change as it 'd be the same with what happened to mormonism in the us . 
  look at salt lake city . 
  you can buy a nice drink at their bars and despite being the home to the lds church there 's a lot of ex-mormons and non-mormons in that city .
