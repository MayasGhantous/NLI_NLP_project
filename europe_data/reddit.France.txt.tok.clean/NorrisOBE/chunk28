  no you do n't . 
  southeast asia has its own muslim identity . 
  africa has its own identity of islam . 
  why ca n't europe ? 
   it does n't have to happen so you 're saying that muslims in france should not assimilate to french society ? 
  so you want more people look up to hate preachers from saudi arabia ? 
  this is what must happen . 
  i 've said this once and i 'll say it again : instead of european muslims looking up to saudi arabia and pakistan , europe 's muslims should look into building their own identity away from outside influences . 
  the tatars and other balkan muslim communities have assimilated pretty well to europe . 
  there is no reason other muslim communities in europe ca n't do the same . 
  israeli settlements are nothing more than a tool for netanyahu to gain new supporters every day . 
  so france is back to new france , trump 's gon na build a wall around spain , germans have legal weed , redneck serial killers and hollywood , the uk has terrible politicians and poisonous water and the wire is set in italy . 
  so nothing different then ? 
  erdoganosexuality is a choice , m8, 
  sweden though is heavily affected by radical wahhabism causing tensions in cities like malmo , and iran is the only country fighting radical wahhabism in both syria and yemen . 
  sweden would have to look up to a sole country like iran that knows how to combat radical wahhabism . 
  the problem though is that iran is the only country that is actively fighting radical wahhabism in the middle east and other parts of the muslim world , and sweden being a country affected by wahhabi violence domestically would need a country like iran to help combat issues like this . 
  sweden can cut off relationship between both saudi arabia and iran , but the question is : who 's gon na stop that malmo violence shit ? 
   can iran afford to drive more potential allies to saudi ? 
  yes !, 
  they survived an entire decade of sanctions without any support from western countries . 
  they can cut off any relationship with the west and not give a fuck . 
  they are willing to see europe get fucked by saudi wahhabism and not face any repercussions for it , and they know that europe knows that iran is the only country that 's fighting radical wahhabism in syria and yemen . 
  the reality is that in geopolitics , any action that is seen as shunning iran would be seen as taking favour with saudi arabia . 
  this is the last thing that a feminist swedish government wants . 
  even if the sweden democrats go to power , they would want to have their female cabinet members wear headscarves if they visit iran in order to not be seen favouring a country that helped elevate the violence in malmo . 
  so sweden should align closely with saudi arabia instead ? 
  i 'm not an apologist . 
  this is the reality of geopolitics . 
  a country that is shunned by iran would be dealing closely with saudi arabia , and a country that is shunned by saudi arabia would be dealing closely with iran . 
  that 's how it has been . 
  the thing though is that many countries send male ministers to deal solely with iran . 
  that means that iran would cut diplomatic relations with sweden and thus sweden would have to align closer with saudi arabia instead , which is the last thing anyone in / r/europe wants . 
  but what if iran cuts off diplomatic relations with sweden ? 
  would n't that make sweden align closer with saudi arabia instead ? 
  would n't that be worse ? 
  iran has cut off relations with several western countries . 
  they do n't give a fuck about it . 
  it 's about sweden . 
  sweden and parts of the west has to choose between shiites ( iran ) and wahhabis ( saudi arabia ) . 
  it 's a lose-lose . 
  but what if iran cuts off diplomatic relations with sweden ? 
  would n't that make sweden align closer with saudi arabia instead ? 
  would n't that be worse ? 
  then what if the iranians would kick them out of iran ? 
  considering how they 're not making the swedish government covering their face as well , this is pretty tame . 
  this is no different from [ queen elizabeth wearing headscarves at mosques ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/britains-queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-the-green-mosque-and-green-tomb-in-picture-id81081533 ) . 
  i do n't see the outrage . 
  then what should the swedish government do then ? 
  yes but this is just a simple headscarf , not a fucking discrimination law . 
  also , i 'd rather if the muslim world adopts [ iran 's headscarf culture ] ( http://www.irantravelingcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6622797038df844e5c6bde1a74e1fff2.jpg ) than those stupid ninja burqa/niqabs that are spreading all over global muslim communities . 
  but it works in france , austria and a lot of countries and it 's a much preferrable system ( alongside av and ranked voting ) over a godawful system like electoral college and fptp . 
  it 's also a much better system to help come up with varied yet definite answers in regards to complex questions . 
  in a two round brexit , the questions in the first round will have multiple answers to a question like `` should the uk stay in the eu '' . 
  instead of a `` yes '' or `` no '' , it 'd go with : a ) yes , and britain should also join the emu b ) yes , but britain should control its own borders and maintain its currency and other economic autonomy . 
  c ) no , but britain should remain in the single market d ) no , and britain should also leave the single market and then round 2 would follow up with deciding between two of the four answers that received the most votes . 
  that would reduce the uncertainty and hysteria surrounding brexit and instead give a calm , reasonable campaign that would satisfy both sides of the political system . 
  seriously , this is why britain and america should 've adopted 2-round polling . 
  bruh , [ sa pa looks wonderful during the winter .

  this town was actually built to accomodate students from nearby english colleges but then property sharks started buying up the houses en masse and it remained a ghost town due to the costly price . 
  it 's a fucking shame . 
  i love the haussmanian buildings on the side . 
  also , i love how the painted rust to all the buildings makes it easy to hide the weather rust caused by the temperatures of southeast asia . 
  a lot of wannabe western/imperial buildings in southeast asia try so hard to be squeaky clean they failed at times as it 's costly . 
  when americans send their performers , they 're not sending their best . 
  wow , he a lot of alternative accomplishments !, 
  i 've seen barnier and he has amazing debate and negotiations skills and thus i can see him solely on the upper hand against boris johnson and david davis in brussels . 
  the closest there is to no go zones are cafes that bar women and nom-arabs from entering . 
  but those are private properties though . 
  that 's close enough to saying `` it was just a prank bro ! '', 
  no fucking shit . 
  no matter how many times the alt-right/fox news/breitbart crowd tries to pull that `` no go zones '' shit , people will still visit paris regardless . 
  not only that , the recent attacks lowered airline rates and in return , attracted more tourists as a result ironically . 
  you can get return tickets to paris from singapore for $ 500 . 
  with that price , of course people would still visit regardless of terrorism . 
  the ira attacks did n't even harm tourism in britain during the 80s and 90s . 
  the same applies to france , really . 
  yeah but at least according to the map france is known for weed , breaking bad , outkast , true detective , and redlettermedia/the onion ( well , obviously ) . 
  remember the time when [ lithuania woman crashes her teen daughters party and had sex with two underage teenage boys ?

  i lost my head at bowling green . 
  ama . 
  poland + lithuania + latvia confirmed for / r/floridaman of europe . 
  seriously , i 'd rather have the police foil more bomb plots and fail them instead of having countless attacks happening daily . 
  they need to continue foiling attacks publicly until the islamists give up . 
  it 's the best way to prevent terrorist attacks and that 's how a lot of terrorist groups like the tamil tigers gave up . 
  `` je suis fatigue '' should be the official motto of islamist terrorism . 
  sabotage and foil their plots as much as they could . 
  well , france does own the lhc and the esa launching stations and they pay pretty well . 
  [ president trump recently threatened to defund uc berkeley over a cancelled breitbart talk ] ( http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/02/trump-tweets-at-uc-berkeley-no-free-speech-no-federal-funds/ ) i do not think that american scientists would be able to resist that long based on how the current administration treats science , technology and climate change . 
  [ a brain drain is happening right now ] ( http://www.salon.com/2017/02/01/trumps-brain-drain-the-presidents-muslim-ban-is-causing-scientists-to-think-about-moving-to-canada/ ) and having been a part of a brain drain from another country with a trumpian political environment , i can bet that more and more scientists will jump ship . 
  and there 's quite a number of big scientific communities in france that are pretty multilingual . 
  cern and esa are always welcoming scientists , researchers and engineers even if they do n't speak french . 
  look at brian cox . 
  yeah but that does n't change the fact that there 's quite a number of failed attempts including last week 's louvre attempt . 
   get smart is he promoting a get smart reboot or something ?
