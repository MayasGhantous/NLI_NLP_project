  someone needs to slap britain in the fact and wake the fuck up . 
  because malaysian army participated in the peacekeeping process and is viewed as one of its military successes . 
  well , the cranberries are still played in every irish pub in malaysia . 
  i still associate every pint with lyrics to linger . 
  god , such a better song than zombie . 
  not every place in paris thinks like paris and marseille . 
  as a muslim chess player , this man is playing a fool 's mate . 
  oh they love erdogan and they saw him as the man to bring back the glory days of the ottomans . 
  also , i got fed with anti-altaturk propaganda in religious class , so yeah . 
  some context : '' [ inilah barisan kita ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r0jifqptcs ) '' is the official anthem of the malaysian military , and malaysia was one of the major participants of the yugoslavian peacekeeping process , and thus a major pride for the malaysian army . 
  malaysia has never won gold in olympics since its independence . 
  every malaysian tiger parent forces their kid to learn either the piano or the violin , and the pieces they learned are mostly schubert and mozart . 
  [ malaysia proudly hosts thousands of iranian students in universities ] ( http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/iran-keen-to-have-more-malaysian-students ) despite [ constant anti-shia propaganda by malaysian religious authorities ] ( https://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/01/14/133463.html ) . 
  [ the portugese destroyed the malaccan empire in the 16th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_malacca ) and thus started the 500 years rule of malaya by foreign empires including the british , the dutch , siam and the japanese . 
  malaysia forces a 300 % tax on foreign cars not made in malaysia ( in order to make people buy proton and perodua ) , which means that low-end foreign cars are considered a luxury in malaysia . 
  [ the prime minister bought scorp\u00e8ne submarines ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/contractwinning-french-sub-builder-dcns-tied-u ) which ended up being a bureaucratic nightmare as it was too pricey and thus a waste of taxpayer 's money . 
  ever since the liberalization of malaysian higher education , [ a lot of private colleges had twinning programs with almost every british , american and australian universities out there ] ( http://www.malaysiauniversity.net/uk-degree/ ) , which looks very shady . 
  for example , you can find a local college in a small village out of nowhere having a twin degree program with university of hertfordshire . 
  syaitan means `` satan '' , and it 's pointed to israel , because '' [ zionist jews are the devil ] ( http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/196642/anti-semitism-in-malaysia ) '' . 
  [ let me post this in solidarity ] ( https://i.imgur.com/laebvcz.jpg ), 
  there are private american schools though , like [ raffles american school ] ( http://www.raffles-american-school.edu.my/usr/page.aspx?pgid=2 ), 
  there 's a lot of american-curriculum schools catering to expats , embassy workers and wealthy locals in many parts of the world . 
  it does n't help that the referendum was set in the worst date possible , smacked just a week before the summer holidays . 
  actually , there was a survey stating that japanese people picked up more english from the internet than from the schooling system . 
  france confirmed for ultimate dbz boss, 
  * tips beret *, 
  man turkey needs to stop getting triggered . 
  seriously , why is erdogan such a triggered snowflake ? 
  britain 's love for their concept of `` sovereignity '' is akin to a meth/krokodil addiction . 
  article 50 will be an overdose of `` sovereignity '' for the british people , and there 's little of chance of surviving a meth/krokodil overdose these days . 
  post-brexit britain is like that one neighbour on meth who 's destroying the reputation and value of a really nice neighbourhood . 
  britain needs an intervention . 
  they 're addicted to a drug called `` sovereignity '' , which is the krokodil of meth 's `` nationalism '' . 
  yeah , they hang out mostly in / r/socialism and / r/communism . 
  [ both sides are literally guilty of that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rza4dct4x0i ), 
  it 's what happens when you cover politics like it 's team sports . 
  [ 4d chess ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trump-is-playing-4d-chess ), 
  * 2019 , as the missiles from china are heading to cities across the us american 1 : why is this happening !!!!!, 
  american 2 : because you voted for trump american 1 : but i did it to stick it to obama and the libs !, 
  i just want to see those libtard tears man !!!!!!, 
  he was going to make america great again !!!, 
  ! 1111111 what about hillary 's emails , huh ?? 
  yeah yeah but stigginit to the libs !!!!! 111111maga !!!, 
  ! 11111drain the swamp !!!! 111soros !!!!! 1111pizzagate111 !!!!!!, 
  edit : lol look at all the triggered trump supporters . 
  maybe you guys should head back to your safe space ? 
  now that i 'm back in malaysia , i now have the perfect recipe for buche de noel aka yule log cake . 
  i even learned how to make different flavours of yule log cakes . 
  i have soft spots for green tea yule log cake . 
  they look pretty baller as fuck . 
  you do n't want to mess 'em with those coats . 
  i ca n't wait for the mark wahlberg movie about this in 5 years time !, 
  can confirm . 
  french teacher was from toulouse . 
  sometimes she slips out a `` chocolatine '' or two instead of saying the proper `` pain au chocolat '' . 
  mont d'or is my favourite . 
  it should be taken with a states right approach . 
  tell each state to implement their own version of healthcare and work laws based on what they see fit . 
  it worked for marijuana . 
  it should work for other propositions . 
  `` delos plans westworld relaunch as a kid-friendly themepark '', 
  so people should go for delusional political fantasies and retreat into their small safe spaces , then ? 
  more like an european union of russia . 
  remember when berlusconi advocated for russian entry to the eu ? 
  yeah , i could russia joining the eu post-putin and replacing germany as the dominant eu power . 
  whether that 's scary or not depends on the direction of russia in the eu . 
  man , russia is literally a safe space . 
  fuck kusturica , this shit is pure art . 
  j'ai entendu qu'il n ' y a pas un reve comme orange is the new black . 
  so will serbia be the most russophilic country in the eu ? 
  they 're privatizing it , which beats the purpose of the nhs . 
  the problem is that under the eu , anything that scraps britain 's post-war social programs since the atlee government can be constructed as human rights violations . 
  yes , they might not have these in other eu countries , but the british left sees healthcare and social security sees healthcare as a human right , something that can be defended in the ecj and not in a judiciary during a tory-led government . 
  you have a tory government that is trying to leave the eu while scrapping the nhs and other social programs , which is seen as trying to turn britain into a dickensian state . 
   do you think he gives a monkeys nuts that it 's now harder for him to work abroad and travel in the eu ? 
  fuck no . 
  because most ordinary people ca n't just get a random job in warsaw in the computer science industry . 
  that still sounds pretty selfish to be honest . 
  just because they have grievances does n't mean that their solution and ideas are n't right . 
  and besides , their `` anti-establishment '' talk should have been presented in last year 's elections . 
  if they want to `` fight the establishment '' then why did they voted for the establishment party in britain ? 
  you know those south korean activists who sends balloons to north korea containing dvds of k-dramas and k-pop ? 
  we need to this from the canadian border . 
  send dvds of this film and idiocracy alongside a healthy supply of baguettes , wines , frozen sauerkrauts , chorizos , nude pictures of diane kruger and registration papers for carte vitale . 
  do n't worry , you 'll see him jumping off a balcony . 
  actually , it seems that russia loves mainstream party politicians espousing the pro-russian line more than than endorsing fringe parties . 
  we see that with trump in the republican party and berlusconi 's forza italia . 
  i always believe that steve bannon is actually nickelodeon producer and known pedophile dan `` put her in the van '' schneider, 
  it is . 
  fillon is a much `` bigger '' friend to putin than the le pens . 
  like , fillon is putin 's regular drinking buddy . 
  the funny thing is that breitbart and rt will be fighting each other unlike in america where both were heavily for trump . 
  breitbart 's rooting for le pen while rt 's rooting for fillon . 
  and besides , breitbart 's got a lot of competition with fdesouche , breizh-info , and \u00c9galit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation . 
  considering the fact that everyone outside the uk wants either `` hard brexit or no brexit '' , there is no way that may 's cabinet would come up with a plan that wo n't make brussels laughing to tears . 
  they 'd have to come up with a british version of a waffle since all the waffle plates are `` european '' . 
  when i was in a malaysian international school the hijab-wearing girls took off their hijabs and went swimming with non-muslims .
