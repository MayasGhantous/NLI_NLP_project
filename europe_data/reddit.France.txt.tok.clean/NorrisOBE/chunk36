  well she literally has a coalition of chaos now ... 
  [ from 0:32 onwards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyzocp0mf8w ), 
  [ it 's from her campaign ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c-z1sr8wsaeanxb.jpg ) and [ hersellf ] ( https://xchange.info/theresa-may-warns-of-unstable-coalition-of-chaos-if-nicola-sturgeon-forms-progressive-alliance-with-labour-and-lib-dems/ ), 
  he 's trump basically, 
  ironic that may accused a labour/lib dem government as a `` government of terrorist sympathisers '', 
  we told you so e t o l d y o u s o, 
  they should . 
  if not deport them , like how americans did with the vietnamese . 
  i 'm just gon na leave this here : http://www.fpri.org/2016/04/us-doesnt-muslim-problem-europe/ https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21615611-why-muslims-fare-better-america-europe-islamic-yet-integrated https://www.cato.org/blog/muslim-immigration-integration-united-states-western-europe https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2016/03/27/why-there-are-muslim-ghettoes-belgium-but-not-united-states/zek1csrr0epwhlmscipwkk/story.html http://www.huffingtonpost.com/saleem-h-ali/islam-and-identity-in-europe_b_9544420.html https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/business/international/for-immigrants-america-is-still-more-welcoming-than-europe.html?mcubz=0 https://niskanencenter.org/blog/muslim-immigrants-assimilate/ muslim americans , especially those of mena origin are still more assimilated than those in europe . 
  there are mena of muslim parentage who assimilate like pretty well in america and canada . 
  the hadids and dj khaled for example , plus tonnes of american rappers ( t-pain , akon , french montana ) who are alongside their muslim non-mena rap counterparts . 
  that 's an issue that should really be answered . 
  reminds me of vietnamese here in malaysia who had to resettle to canada because of their unhappiness with the country . 
   you do realize the mena migrants have n't really integrated anywhere in the western world . 
  mena migrants have integrated pretty well in the us since the 1970s . 
  lebanese , iranian , algerian , palestinian and moroccan americans do pretty well in the states ( especially iranian and palestinian americans ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure scandinavian countries have little to no assimilation program that resembles other assimilation programs like in the us , canada or france . 
  the eu does n't have a resettlement and assimilation policy similar to that many western countries offered to the vietnamese refugees in guam and pulau bidong who were bound for the us , france and canada , and that 's the core problem . 
   but they still speak the same core language and share the same wider culture . 
  south koreans disagree with you that . 
  [ 60 % of korean spoken in north korea is so different from that of south korea ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/world/asia/30iht-dialect.2644361.html?mcubz=0 ) , it 's basically close to becoming the portugese of south korea 's spanish , or like chiac to the average parisian . 
  it takes almost 1 half to 2 years for a north korean refugee to learn the korean of south korea . 
  that 's pretty much the average years of learning most european languages . 
  the refugees assimilate to the culture ( aka they 'll complain less ) and thus it makes the local population happy ? 
  how to speak the local language , speak english , learn and adapt to the local cultures , etc. 
  [ south korea did it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanawon ) , and so did [ and so did america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_new_life ), 
  like i 've said : before sending them , teach them . 
  back during the vietnam boat people crisis , pulau bidong 's operations were outsourced to private non-profits like oxfam , worldvision and other international government agencies like the us peace corps and canada corps . 
  plus , south korea 's hanawon shared its budget with both the south korean government and churches all over south korea , making it easy for the south korean government to operate the centre without budgetary issues . 
  look , the eu should really learn from how america dealt with vietnamese refugees and how south koreans are dealing with north korean refugees . 
  every refugee , and i mean every refugee should be sent to a relocation and reeducation centre like orote point , pulau bidong and hanawon and they should be forced to learn the languages and cultures of the countries of their destination and then be accepted to those countries or else be sent back to where they originally came from . 
  vietnamese refugees who refused to learn the english/french language ( s ) and western culture in general were sent back to vietnam . 
  why ca n't the eu do the same thing ? 
  wow , that water is really wet , huh ? 
  the last time you guys asked for reformation in islam it led to wahhabism and the iranian revolution . 
  the only people who answered the call for reformation are usually crazy imams with guns . 
  please stop . 
   how is that the case ? 
  that example sounds more like `` yea we can do whatever with this religion as long as it fits our goals and it can change anytime '' the thing though is that islam survives through shredding the parts of islam incompatible with culture and climate of an area and then adopting the values of that culture and climate into islam . 
  that 's why islam in indochina is completely different from the islam practised in north africa , and the islam practised in oman was legitimate practised since muhammad 's era but was completely separate from sunni and shiite islam . 
  it 's no different from spanish catholics having to adapt to philippine tribalism or sengoku-era japanese culture . 
   as opposed to a permanent structural change that is reflected throughout the entire religion . 
  the latter though is much more damaging as they 've tried and it led to things like wahhabism and the iranian revolution . 
  most of the people who called for an islamic reformation have been people like muhammad iqbal who called for a reinterpretation of islamic instead of a reformation of muslim society , and that 's what has led to the disaster in the middle east . 
  muslims are sick of calls for `` reformation '' since the ones who answered the call have been radical nutters for the last 60 years . 
  fuck that . 
  i was not talking about that . 
  as my flair mentioned , originally malaysian . 
  that 's nothing . 
  whenever i walk around paris people keep asking me `` have you heard of the high elves ? '', 
  in english and french only to die from eating pomme empoisonn\u00e9e moments later . 
  please stop doing that . 
  as a muslim , i do n't consider islam to be progressive but it is very adaptable compared to christianity . 
  when the first muslim traders went to the newly-formed kingdom of malacca , they had to abandon majority of islamic laws and traditions in order to convert parameswara to islam and marry him with the princess of pasai . 
  honestly britain should 've waited for chinese economic growth before giving hk back to china . 
  they gave hk back in the mid-80s when china was still recovering from the cultural revolution , shenzhen was still an undeveloped coal city and things like the tianamen square massacre were about happen in the horizon . 
  even in 1997 china was still not a fully realized capitalist country . 
  also , hong kong in 1997 was suffering from the asian economic crisis and china ( mostly unaffected by the crisis ) just rolling their troops and flags while hk citizens were facing a recession added more salt to hong kong 's wounds . 
  the macau takeover was handled better imo . 
  not the places where i lived though . 
  i 'm originally from malaysia , and lived in quite a few places . 
  i only saw a personal pc somewhere in like 1995 , and that was only when me and my family came back from cambodia . 
  in cambodia , the only people using computers were embassies and un staff so we only got our first personal pc when we came back to malaysia . 
  and even then our computer had no internet !, 
  we only got internet in 1998 so the only purpose for our personal pc was to write documents in lotus and play both doom and command and conquer red alert . 
  internet back then was pricey and the only time i got to use the internet was whenever me and my family went to visit singapore during long holidays where my grandparents ' home had an internet computer thanks to my late uncle . 
  when i first learned french , it was through french in action . 
  this was like in the mid-1990s , and computers and internet were still in infancy . 
  seeing mireille using mnitel like how we used the internet today was fascinating . 
  back then , you ca n't use the internet to even check movie dates , but people were using minitel to do exactly that . 
  it blew my mind . 
  so you 're saying that the le pen family are jojo 's bizarre adventure villains ? 
  kinda explains benoit `` hamon '', 
   and we have treated our history basically like germans in 90s . 
  and we got nothing from that . 
  [ south korea did tonnes of massacres towards the vietnamese ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20081201111114/http://www.hamline.edu/~rkagan/publications_asian%20literary%20views%20on%20vietnam.html ) during the vietnam war ( and it was also one of the factors why america lost the vietnam war ) . 
  and yet , south korea literally apologized and now [ south korea is vietnam 's third larget trading partner ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20070614012334/http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/09/16/viet.t_0.php ) . 
  nowadays , [ you see tonnes of vietnamese kids listening to k-pop ] ( https://ticketbox.vn/kplusconcert/en ) instead of propangadising about killing koreans or whatever . 
  if south korea can do it , so can russia . 
  yeah but that 's mainly meant for sitcoms , not panel shows . 
  looks like he 's done more acid than acid attack . 
  / r/beholdthemasterrace material right here . 
  do n't european governments have something like operation paperclip for jihadis or something that could use ex-jihadis to help determine and prevent radicalisation in certain communities ? 
  i 'm pretty sure mi5 and dgse are recruiting right now . 
  rolling start !!!!!!!, 
  ps : shout-out to arcade street and la t\u00eate dans les nuages .

  oliver stone and his family are a bunch of crazy nutjobs . 
  this is the man who helped popularize jfk conspiracy theory in the 1990s with his film . 
  he seriously thinks that the warren commission is an illuminati propaganda . 
  what a crock of shit .

  so much for daddy 's tribute film to 9/11 victims . 
  is/daesh is losing raqqa to sdf/ypg day by day .
