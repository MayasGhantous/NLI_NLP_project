  wow , britain now has a government run by terrorist sympathizers just as may predicted !, 
  a bargain-bin self-fulfilling prophecy !, 
  there have been sufi mosques in india that were bombed hundreds of times but are still operating today . 
  i hope they 'll do fine . 
  looks like my internet speed 's strong and stable enough to fap to this in 4k . 
   but i have yet to see new age spiritual-bullshit idiots ram their vans into pedestrians , decapitate people , fly planes into buildings , detonate suicide vests at teen concerts , or ban teaching evolution at a country level . 
  [ it 's already started ] ( https://www.wired.com/2017/05/anti-vaxxers-brought-war-minnesota-came-measles/ ) . 
  i consider the anti-vaccine movement to be as dangerous as terrorists . 
  i do not want children of antivax morons to infect my kids with measles the same way i do not want terrorists to attack my local shopping mall . 
  i 've seen religions and cults pop out of non-theistic beliefs . 
  and yes , more people might be less religious , but there are more people who considers themselves `` spiritual '' and/or belief in pseudomagical garbage like homeopathic remedies , evps and other new age shit . 
  there are people who do n't believe in god but believed that vaccines caused autism ( like bill maher ) and that marina abramovic performs satanic rituals in new york 's moma . 
  that is as dangerous as religious fundamentalism . 
  religions can never die . 
  it 's peoples needs to believe in something . 
  when the abrahamic religions die we might see it replaced with the church of atom and caesar 's legion . 
  well , abortion is legalized in muslim if it 's threatening the life of the mother . 
  some muslim countries like malaysia and indonesia do n't give a shit though and hospitals can perform not only abortions but also euthanasia . 
  as a muslim , it 's complicated . 
  there are certain sects that supported evolutionary theory as invented by al-jahiz instead of darwinian thought . 
  they support the theory of evolution as part of teaching about `` the islamic golden age '' . 
  evolution , like abortion are issues that the muslim world is on the fence . 
  they do n't know whether to side with conservative christians/jews or islamic history in these issues . 
  please defend this , leavers . 
  please . 
  he kind of deserved it though, 
  many thais say that he 's a secret ladyboy like those in thai cabaret clubs . 
  [ is n't this the moron who wants france to join an economic union with venezuela ? 
  it should be . 
  it should 've not just been a `` potential '' . 
  it 's no different than the van crash last week . 
  well , it depends . 
  the hijab worn like a scarf is fine . 
  if it 's a rousari or a shawl/selendang then it 's okay because they 're loose enough to be worn and removed for public buildings . 
  plus , they have no associations with religion ( both rousaris and selendangs have existed from mesopotamian times ) and thus they 're not breaking la\u00efc laws . 
  but traditional hijabs like khimars and chadoors are considered on the same level as a nun 's veil and it 's a violation of la\u00efcite as they 're also associated with islamism ( while burqas are associated with wahhabism and salafism ) . 
  i 'm a strong believer in burqas being completely unnecessary outside of the middle east/central asia and i strongly support such bans . 
  and if students want to wear the hijab in school , they can go to an islamic private school . 
  the same way you want to go a catholic school if you want to become a nun . 
  that 's pretty much the law and should remain that . 
  um , myanmar and sri lanka had buddhist terrorism you know and it 's as bad as middle eastern violence . 
  more like no one wants that crap . 
  the problem though is that western superpowers fucked over the middle east for 100 years and are only starting to face the consequences recently . 
  people like myself have terrible metabolism . 
  that 's why we drink like tonnes of water during sahoor . 
  for me though , it 's not the problem of starving or getting thirsty , it 's the problem of sleep . 
  waking up early to prepare for ramadhan fucks up with your metabolism , but it 's worse if you 're a caffeine addict like myself . 
  caffeine withdrawal is a huge problem . 
  though [ i practice intermittent fasting ] ( http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/01/25/intermittent-fasting/ ) during ramadan which benefits me more in the long term per / r/fitness . 
  more muslims in the muslim world have died due to islamic terrorism in the last 40 years than people attended this march . 
  look , if they wanted to do this they should 've just made an `` anti-terrorism iftar reception '' instead of a peace march . 
  it 's ramadan . 
  muslims like myself do things like play civilization v or playerunknown 's battlegrounds for 10 hours instead of going to a fucking peace march that would make people starve . 
  at least do this thing in the most ramadan way possible . 
  edit : holy fuck this comment went from +5 upvotes to just -10 downvotes within an hour . 
  what the fuck man . 
  this is a shame . 
  i 've never seen farron spreading his beliefs openly and he did his best trying to reshape the lib dems after 2015 . 
  vincent cable is a good replacement imo . 
  he was the most outspoken lib dem during the coalition , more outspoken than clegg . 
  either him or jo swinson , who won her seat back from the snp ( which is big news ) , is almost left of corbyn ( except on the eu ) and is a strong remainer . 
  honestly as a muslim ramadan is the best and worst thing to happen to any muslim really . 
  it 's the only reason why i waste 10 hours in civilization 5 . 
  [ and i thought that me wanting lord buckethead to lead brexit negotiations was a joke ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g7hs3/theresa_may_stood_against_lord_buckethead_in_uk/dio2vjj/ ) ... 
  it 's better to remain neutral when it comes to this , tbh . 
  maybe europe should prop up its own middle eastern country against both saudi arabia and iran . 
  america has the saudis , russia has iran and i think that either tunisia ( secular democracy with lots of oil ) or jordan ( constitutional monarchy with shale oil , natural gas and more liberal laws than both saudi and iran ) should be the eu 's own saudi arabia/iran . 
  reality is my favourite episode of the thick of it . 
  now that 's the guy i want to see in the uk side of the brexit negotiations team in brussels, 
  yeah but in the context of africa , africa has tonnes of industries that are [ until recently being developed with the help of china ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj79k-cuzhu ) . 
  none of the western countries have even bothered with propping up african industries , which is what led to the vicious cycles of famine , war and shady charities like live aid and invisible children . 
  ryzen 5 1400 is cheaper than many i5s . 
  and that 's why they 're overpriced as fuck . 
  yeah , because we want to buy $ 10k pc products made in europe . 
  i hope everyone in britain is ready for their internet to be replaced by maynet, 
  like i 've said : we need less live aids and more live investments in regards to africa . 
  the best way to help africa is to build their economies and industries . 
  africans want westerners to buy `` made in africa '' products , not `` bono 's africahelp products made in china '' . 
  p r o j e c t i o n r o j e c t i o n, 
  [ who loves you and who do you love ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ceegnwsenq ), 
  because she is the senate . 
  this is what an european mosque should look like , at least in the polish sense . 
  none of that ugly wahhabi shit . 
  something that ends with `` cide '' i guess . 
  if labour were to form a coalition , good luck . 
  because the other left-wing parties ( lib dems , snp , greens , plaid ) are pro-remain and labour would 've to compromise on their pro-brexit stance in order to form a coalition . 
   they also seem to get a hardon over ukip , they pretty much single handily promote a party that has only had 1 ( albeit briefly ) mp it 's evident with question time since 2014 , since pretty almost much almost every single audience member had a pro-ukip stance since the 2014 european parliament . 
  they should 've just renamed question time `` the ukip orgy hour '' . 
  this is why they should air threads on tv channels every year as a reminder of the horrors of a potential nuclear war . 
  before you ask anyone whether they are able to press the button , you should ask yourself : are you able to protect your family from scorching heat of 1000 degrees caused by a nuke ? 
  pokemalta go to the polls, 
  beren was the son of barahir and both led an expedition to defeat morgoth who ruled half of middle earth and morgoth was a giant the size of the tower of sauron . 
  it was my fav . 
  part of the silmairillon and it 's a reason why i wanted the silmairillon to be turned into a tv series . 
  please do n't penetrate my covfefe, 
  that is my belief as well, 
  i do see korea , japan , taiwan and indonesia ( post-2004 ) being an economic model for the middle east . 
  yup , it 's the failure of western think tanks trying to make political systems more important than economic reforms when it comes to the middle east .
