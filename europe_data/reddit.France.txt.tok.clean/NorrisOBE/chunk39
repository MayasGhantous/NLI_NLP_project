  if corbyn fucks up so bad that blair successfully took back the labour party i 'm gon na laugh so hard . 
  a mathematician , a raid chief , a widow , a bullfighter . 
  this is a very interesting list , a far cry from the ppe oxford types and ex-marine/banker/lawyer types you see in anglophone countries, 
  the handmaid 's tale is not a manual . 
  [ his ted talk is fucking entertaining ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc0kthyo0hu ) he being in politics is fucking essential for the advancement of research and science in politics . 
  yeah but ouwah sohvahraynetee innit !, 
  the banking clan will sign your treaty, 
  rip . 
  children was a great tune and it 's a shame that many great trance producers are mostly either one-hit wonders ( darude , energy 52 , robert miles ) , those with their own radio stations ( above and beyond , armin van buren , paul oakenfold ) or do n't even produce trance anymore ( tiesto , deadmau5 , underworld ) . 
  it 's the opposite with house , dnb and ukg producers like pendulum and disclosure . 
  it 's treason , then, 
  this is why macron won . 
  marine le pen should 've campaigned in wisconsin more . 
  [ this song perfectly sums up monsieur valls ( and marion marechal ) right now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kyyvrbx4v0 ), 
  it 's fucking genius how the macron campaign used tonnes of fake data , fake emails and fake folders to fool hackers in the open . 
  if anyone wants to try to help , there 's an organization called the rainbow railroad that is raising funds to help lgbt people escape violence and persecution in places like chechnya . 
  these concentration camps are a main focus of the organization . 
  [ canadian site ] ( https://www.rainbowrailroad.ca/ ) [ american site ] ( http://americanrainbowrailroad.org/ ) remember , the handmaid 's tale is not a manual . 
  the world is not meant to live like gilead . 
  a lot of things . 
  lived there between late 2014 to early 2016 and loved almost every part of it . 
  hoping to return for my master 's degree ( hence my flair ) . 
  jeb is a mess, 
  the oppression of / r/le _ pen will never return they have lost . 
  ooh scary !!!!, 
  they should 've picked jean-yves le drian to run in 2011 instead of hollande . 
  i do n't know why no one wanted le drian . 
  he was one of the most popular ps politicians and would 've defeated hollande and aubry combined if he ran in 2011 . 
  well considering how the media did not freak out about the macron leaks unlike the hillary emails due to french law , hopefully it did not create any effect . 
  yeah it certainly seems that way when you compare them to the trump campaign in the last 2 days before the election . 
  like , the trump campaign did not feel a single sense of incoming defeat . 
  they knew that somehow trump will win especially after the comey letter . 
  kellyanne conway did not even sound defeatist during the last few days of the election unlike romney 's campaign manager matt rhoades . 
  marine le pen 's campaign manager meanwhile ( david rachline ) has sounded a bit sour during recent radio interviews after the debate . 
  if macron does win , then it can also prove that timeliness is essential to the alt-right if they wanted to do that macronleaks shit . 
  the whole timing for macronleaks was terrible and they could 've done this before the first debate even . 
  / r/europe is left-wing ? 
  oh yeah , the guy who looks like an older kad merad . 
  he should 've ran for president in 2011 for the ps imo . 
  holy shit you 're right . 
  steven seagal had always been an asshole in hollywood , mma , martial arts and even modern policing communities . 
  the reason why you do n't hear those is because he 's not doing big hollywood films like in the 90s . 
  a surprise to be sure , but a welcome one . 
  the problem though is that putin and the kremlin is too thick to understand that their economy is hurt because they have to continue this bullshit `` masculine '' charade . 
  pineapple is a serious crime though . 
  i 'd burn any italian city that dares to add pineapple to authentic italian pizza . 
  let us remember steven seagal 's `` punani snatching '' ama : https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/4i0jso/i_am_actor_steven_seagal_live_from_thailand_ama/ never forget , steve !, 
  never forget !, 
  marine le pen : did you ever hear the tragedy of marechal petain `` the wise '' ? 
  i thought not . 
  it 's not a story en marche would tell you . 
  it 's a vichy legend . 
  marechal petain was a marechal of the vichy regime , so powerful and so wise he could use the nazis to influence the french to hate jews ... 
  he had such a knowledge of fascism that he could even allow jews in the free zone to be sent to the camps . 
  fascism is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural . 
  he became so powerful ... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power , which eventually , of course , he did . 
  unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew , then his apprentice betrayed him to join la r\u00e9sistance . 
  it 's ironic , he could save others from death , but not himself . 
  marion mar\u00e9chal : is it possible to learn this power ? 
  marine le pen : not from en marche . 
  that explains it . 
  ah , so ja rule 's operating a greek tourism company now . 
  wow it 's like life imitating art !, 
  this sounds like a ponzi/mlm/pyramid scheme . 
  putin tells all the far-right/far-left/alt-right / nationalist leaders to support him with a loan from russian banks and the far-right/far-left/alt-right / nationalist has to recruit as many supporters as they could so that they could win elections and repay that money back . 
  the kremlin and orthodox church 's holy war against pokemon go is the funniest thing ever . 
  like , it 's so fucking pathetic . 
  looks like the greek orthodox teaches you about the basics of cqc, 
   douglas murray oh , another neocon trying to buck the alt-right meme . 
  okay . 
  looks like a mosque from a certain distance . 
  post this to / r/justneckbeardthings, 
  `` just fuck my presidency up , fam '' - marine le pen, 
  she committed sudoku . 
  she 's literallly the personification of / r/badeconomics . 
  yes . 
  [ there 's also a tv show adaptation currently running in the us for hulu . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/pjtonrzxtjs ) it 's one of the best shows i 've seen this whole year . 
  the handmaid 's tale is not a manual , kadyrov, 
  ah , so the eu are the new jews . 
  `` it 's okay when britain does it '', 
  the `` millenials '' in the headline looked like characters from les revenants . 
  pretty apt imo . 
  `` can we hold a luxury music festival over there ? 
  my friend billy 's looking to invest '' - ja rule, 
  `` looks nice '' - ja rule, 
  been saying this since fucking forever . 
  ps : do n't send your kids to do [ ppe at oxford ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_university_of_oxford_people_with_ppe_degrees ) . 
  it makes your kids do dumb shit like supporting dumb wars and organising stupid referendums . 
  well he did say some truly horrid things and what he did in regards to turkey was rubbish . 
  so one of his main arguments for leaving the eu was that he fears turkey joining the eu and yet a few months ago he said that the foreign office will still support turkey 's ascension to the eu . 
  the fuck ? 
  because by pushing for brexit , she could do away with eu regulations and continue plans for [ further privatisation of government services ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/02/police-privatisation-security-firms-crime ) like [ the nhs ] ( https://tompride.wordpress.com/2017/04/23/theresa-mays-secret-plans-to-replace-nhs-england-with-private-us-healthcare-system-kaiser-permanente/ ) . 
  sure , but also you have brexiters and the british right-wing press being arrogant and ignorant too . 
  it 's a circlejerk of pompousness that would make the outside observer feel repulsive by it . 
  have you ever look at something like [ the rich kids of instagram ] ( https://richkidsofinstagram.com/ ) and feel disgusted by it ? 
  that 's how many in europe look at the british government , the british press and the british society post-brexit . 
  well , considering the right-wing press environment and the brexit voting bloc , she has to present a superior negotiating stance for her country which makes her and her cabinet look delusional to those outside britain . 
  she knows that all this posturing is for internal propaganda purposes and will never sway anyone outside britain . 
  hell , she picked david davies for brexit secretary and boris johnson as foreign secretary .
