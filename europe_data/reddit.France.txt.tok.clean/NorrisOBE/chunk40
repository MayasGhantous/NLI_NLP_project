  boris fucking johnson . 
  she knows that this whole shit is a joke and that she 's doing this shit just to get on with it . 
   edit : i got banned from that subreddit after posting this question here . 
  holy fucking shit . 
  / r/russia is literally a safe space . 
  [ lol they share the same colour scheme with the pan-islamic party of malaysia ] ( http://img.astroawani.com/2013-04/61366444973_freesize.jpg ) why do fascists and neo-islamists love sharing the same aesthetics ? 
  well , she definitely does n't look like the type who has to `` look stupid '' in order to get easy votes . 
  and this is why people are angry that a federal subject of russia is allowing chechnya to become one of those countries . 
   r/russia can do what it wants . 
  and we can criticize it for ignoring the biggest news happening to one of the most hated sexual minorities in the world . 
  that does n't excuse it not being featured in / r/russia, 
  it 's a region in russia the same way brittany/guyane is a region in france . 
  um , it 's in the first episode of the hulu series . 
  since everyone 's seen that episode , i do n't consider it a mass-spoiler anymore . 
  also , there 's a lack of articles and discussions on this in / r/russia . 
  i wonder why ... 
  i do n't have clips from the current hulu series , but [ this scene from the 1990 film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-45xl7qlxc ) looks like what 's happening in chechnya right now . 
  ps : the handmaid was executed for homosexuality in the novel , not adultery . 
  okay then , here 's an advice from [ the americans ] ( http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160526144550-us-special-operations-forces-in-syria-3-super-169.jpg ) . 
  michs are fucking cool and the keyword is `` modular '' , which means that it fits things like headsets and wearables necessary for spec ops involving regular and special forces combined . 
  it makes the british army helmet look like ramen bowls, 
  god , british combat helmets are so fucking ugly . 
  you guys are literally putting porcelain ramen bowls on your heads . 
  can you guys please switch to [ modular integrated combat helmets ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vfzbrew.jpg ) already ? 
  is this the fyre festival of far-right parties ? 
  i wish i was a staunch racist because i could 've called him `` conrad n **** r '', 
  [ he maxed out his s-link with kawakami-sensei ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dvu97cc.png ), 
  did you ever hear the tragedy of sultan mehmed the wise ? 
  i thought not . 
  it 's not a story the gulenists would tell you . 
  sultan mehmed was a sultan of the ottomans , so powerful and so wise he could use the pashas to influence the east and destroy armenians ... he had such a knowledge of the dark side , he could even make the armenians he cared about die . 
  he became so powerful ... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power , which eventually , of course , he did . 
  unfortunately , he taught his apprentices everything he knew , then his apprentice secularised turkey . 
  ironic . 
  he could save others from death , but not himself . 
  when your de-facto leader marine le pen supports banning sikh turbans in france , she rationalised by saying :  [ `` we do n't have a lot of sikhs in france . 
  we 've got some . 
  but we do n't really hear much from them or about them . 
  which is good news . '' ] ( http://indianexpress.com/article/research/french-presidential-elections-2017-national-front-french-secularism-and-how-it-helps-marine-le-pen-say-no-to-sikh-turbans-4624853/ ) what did she mean by `` we do n't really hear much from them or about them . 
  which is good news '' ? 
  does she mean that it 's okay for french sikhs to be sidelined by society due to their low numbers ? 
  does n't that go against the foundations of democracy ? 
  as a millenial , this really frustrates me as real change goes into the heart of the government . 
  in persona 5 , the phantom thieves infiltrate a palace . 
  they do n't cause havoc outside and then burn a few cars . 
  and the reason why i use persona 5 is because the game 's theme is about the actual goal of youths : to go into the heart of society and `` steal '' their hearts and minds . 
  ( and the game laments a lot about the lack of youth participation in japanese politics and legal systems that led to the abuse authority by previous generations ) . 
  this means that youths not only have to vote but also participate and get involved in government . 
  if anything , many governments around the world need young and millenial politicians to disrupt the baby boomer-focused governments . 
  wow : i got downvoted for supporting youth participation in government and politics . 
  it 's no wonder why youths will always get fucked . 
  um , it 's `` socialism with chinese characteristics '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 're going to pull a literall doll puppet as the interim fn leader under marine le pen comes back . 
  they could make a [ realdoll ] ( https://www.realdoll.com/ ) that resembles marion marechal and then have it blast [ le chant des cohortes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr1yb0b5pk0 ) 24/7 . 
  but remember , the le pens are friends of the gays !, 
  wincest was legal until 2010 . 
  do they seriously think that they can pull anglophonic puritan-shaming to the french ? 
  albania is more secular than turkey, 
  like i 've said , albania as both a member of the eu and oic would be a trojan to the eu playing a role in things like halal food , halal trade and islamic banking ( like takaful ) . 
  these things need heavy eu regulations . 
  well having an oic member in the eu would put the eu 's interests into regulating things like halal food , halal trade and islamic banking . 
  these things need heavy regulations . 
  good . 
  there are better muslim countries like bosnia , kosovo and albania ( an oic member ) that deserve eu membership . 
  and like i 've said , having witnessed to populists in their expatriated countries would make them less supportive of such sentiments back home . 
  it 's interesting how macron , fillon and melenchon are popular amongst french expats in east and southeast asia whereas there is little support for marine le pen . 
  maybe because expats are so exposed to the asian le pens like prabowo , jamal yunos , duterte , shintaro ishihara , etc. 
  `` do n't go , i love europe too !!! '', 
  yeah that is not fancy . 
  maybe in jakarta with currency converted to rupiah , but not paris . 
  that 's the price my family paid for a daily meal when they visited paris . 
  i 've signed in way pricier places . 
  this reminds me of when fox news called obama a `` snob '' when he used dijon mustard on a hot dog . 
  can you guys do a reenactment with berlusconi ? 
  someone should shop erdogan 's head creeping over the capital, 
  no it is n't . 
  also , this is discriminatory to those from introverted countries like japan and parts of the middle east . 
  eye contact ca n't be taught . 
  it 's a part of introverted behavior . 
  from your point of view perhaps . 
  bruh , i criticised erdogan for turning turkey into a one party state like , yesterday . 
  you can just look at my ottoman empire meme at the armenian genocide remembrance thread . 
  so it 's okay that lbj caused the loss of congress and senate , but it 's not okay for obama to lose congress and senate . 
  alright . 
  [ and look what happened to congress and senate after the passage of the civil rights act ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/us_1966_senate_election_map.svg/800px-us_1966_senate_election_map.svg.png ) it 's literally no different than the loss of the democratic congress and senate after passing the aca . 
  and now , the circle is complete !, 
  the president does n't run the direction of the party . 
  wot in carnation - ant\u00f3nio de oliveira salazar, 
  you see , that 's the thing : the settlements are basically easy scores for netanyahu to gain voters . 
  there 's a lot of likudis in the settlements and i doubt that other parties like the zionist union can attract settlement voters because their opposition to the settlements . 
  just like how north korea 's nuclear program is a way to for them to end the sunshine policy , netanyahu 's banking on the settlements to help him regain power for him in the next 2 decades and kill off the two-state solution for good , accelerating more problems for the middle east and thus allowing islamofascists , shiite clerics and baathists to use palestine for propaganda points . 
  it 's a lose-lose for palestine and a win-win for the ultra-zionists and islamists . 
  hooray . 
  netanyahu is basically pushing for a one party state , eh ? 
  gabriel should just meet with those groups because netanyahu is not the sole representative of israel . 
  this . 
  this is a long con , and 2 weeks ai n't that long . 
  for an area with a lot of muslims , marseille goes towards le pen a lot . 
  either a lot of muslims do n't vote or tend to vote against their own interests for some reason . 
  there 's omar from the wire .
