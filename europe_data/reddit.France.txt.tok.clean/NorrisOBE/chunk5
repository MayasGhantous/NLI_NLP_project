  it 's because they can foster propaganda back home and among russian expats that `` the west is failing '' and [ it shows ] ( http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/liz-wahl-quit-russia-today-putins-pawn-104888.html#.u4wyqzsswmd ) . 
  and russia funding golden dawn and fn is pretty much helping their propaganda that the eu is run by fascist homosexuals and is imploding any minute now . 
  [ no fucking shit ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/05/07/its-not-just-ukraine-putins-friends-in-europe-are-gaining-strength/ ) i would n't be surprised if the kremlin were giving monetary aid to far-right parties the same way [ the kgb armed ira rebels ] ( http://irishecho.com/2011/02/kgb-armed-official-ira-book-reveals/ ) and [ washington funding right-wing regimes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_support_of_authoritarian_regimes ), 
  it 's pretty ironic that marseille is both beautiful and dangerous . 
  it 's like tijuana and new york city combined . 
  that actually happened : http://www.reddit.com/r/montageparodies/comments/26uy8z/rmontageparodies_confirmed_to_be_illuminati/, 
  the problem is that to the media , moderate/liberal views do n't sell . 
  and when moderate/liberal views do sell , it usually ends up with death threats . 
  [ like maajid nawaz , for example ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-clegg-attacks-death-threats-against-maajid-nawaz--lib-dem-candidate-who-tweeted-a-cartoon-of-the-prophet-mohammed-and-jesus-greeting-each-other-9086469.html ) . 
  well , the apartheid made it that way . 
  congratulations , you 've just explained everything wrong with the apartheid . 
  yes , i do . 
  the same applies to ira , al-qaeda , hezbollah , fatah and hamas . 
  but you did n't answer my question : if you 're a black kid living in sa during the apartheid and you are forbidden from living a normal life , what would you do ? 
  well , here 's the problem : if you 're a black kid living in sa during the apartheid and you are forbidden from living a normal life , what would you do ? 
  of course he is a terrorist . 
  i 'm not denying that either . 
  but when people spoke highly of mandela , it is because he really helped end apartheid which is way beyond any terrorist attack he was involved in . 
  i ca n't think of a positive impact holeindre did in comparison to mandela . 
  i 'm just gon na quote / r/badhistory here :  it is true the anc were involved in acts which could be considered terrorist , but he is incredibly selective in his use of facts and has put a massive spin put on the portrayal . 
  he 's ignoring everything the apartheid government did and made botha seem perfectly innocent - when actually his ` offer ' for mandela to renounce violence would be comparable to phillippe petain asking a french resistance fighter to do the same : ridiculously hypocritical and largely farcical . 
   he absolutely ignores the context of south africa at that time . 
  the anc was banned , and the government were violently repressing opposition to apartheid . 
  they were also getting another group which was fighting apartheid , the zulu nationalist inkatha , to wage race war upon the anc ( a predominantly xhosa group ) , in vicious fighting which killed thousands - divide and rule . 
  simultaneously , they were doing their level best to destabilize neighbouring black countries like namibia and mozambique . 
   essentially , it 's the equivalent of talking about the resistance to nazi germany in a completely negative light while not actually mentioning the holocaust or any related atrocities . 
  it 's a devious , disgusting misinterpretation , but because reddit loves contrarians , they 're lapping it up . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1ha1v1/a_conversation_about_nelson_mandela_in_reddit/casok25 sure , nelson mandela was a terrorist but considering it 's the apartheid i would n't see why terrorism is n't the option . 
  so can we also oppose if the fn would propose naming a street after roger holeindre ? 
  so , um a question : how will the success of the fn in france affect french society at large ? 
  and how will the fn 's popularity affect future migrants like myself ? 
   fedoras are a symbol for atheists ? 
  because, 
  holy shit what a cunt, 
  now , as a muslim may i ask : if this law is meant to fine islamophobes , does this law apply to radical muslims who do hate speech towards other minorities too ? 
  for a country that does n't give a fuck about eurovision , france sure wins a lot eh ? 
  look , you may be new here , but / r/europe is where many top minds collaborate , and routinely outsmart the most well funded , well equipped and diabolical organizations on earth . 
  how do we do it ? 
  top thinkers , experts on every field , unparalleled investigative skills and fearlessness . 
  i would trust a top comment here over pretty much any news source , especially a mainstream source , any day . 
  `` how can wwii be real if poland is n't real ? '', 
  i can understand switzerland since taxes whatever , but france is pretty surprising . 
  does the numbers also account to those who stay in france for 3 to 6 months to learn french ? 
  thanks for this informative post . 
  as a muslim , if this is a private school exclusively for muslim parents , then i 'm okay with this . 
  but if this is state-funded , then it 's pretty much wrong .

   same goes for the eu : despite the heavy anti-russian rhetoric you still continue to buy russian energy . 
  oil = / = pop culture . 
  i ca n't think of any pop culture consumed from russia in the last decade except tatu and russian ark ( fantastic film btw ) . 
  and both stalker chernobyl and metro last light are made by a ukrainian studio . 
  and this is what i am talking about . 
  how can russia win a war against the west when russia has yet to produce a cultural boom similar to america , uk , france , korea and japan that can ensure a cultural victory against the west as backup ? 
  if putin is serious about winning the world 's hearts and minds , i seriously believe that creating art and culture that can wow the world is a much better foreign policy than anything that involves guns and tanks . 
  russian cinema should be winning more cannes and oscar awards than britain , russia should have a music scene that can compete against k-pop , russia should be making its own period dramas about the tsars similar to britain 's downton abbey and korea 's queen seondeok , and russia should be starting an animation boom after the brilliant success of old man and the sea , rivalling both japan and france . 
  a strong cultural foreign policy is what helped the west and its allies win the cold war . 
  russia needs to see that a strong pop culture is a much better rapprochment to the west against guns and tanks . 
  people in the west have a much more positive view of korea and japan thanks to k-pop and anime , so yeah i do n't see why russia needs to flex its muscles when it can return to the days of tolstoy and rachmaninoff . 
  as a frenchman , i really would love if putin had a cultural foreign policy as strong and powerful as western foreign policy . 
  pretty much every cable package in the world has bbc entertainment , fox hd , tv 5 monde , kbs one and animax . 
  there should be a russian pop culture channel inside there too . 
  and it 's this separation that would force putin to abandon his authoritarianism or else russia will implode economically and politically . 
  it happened in south korea , it happened in south africa , it 's going to happen in china and it will definitely happen in russia . 
  * je suis d'accord . 
  * i agree . 
  in fact , the perfect description for a french man would be someone like jean dujardin and jean reno . 
  well i do believe that everytime russia tries to out-ball the us and europe , the us and europe will eventually win via `` cultural victory '' as sid meier calls it . 
  america , britain , france , lapan and korea are currently running the sphere of arts and pop culture . 
  a cultural victory is what led to the west winning cold war , and putin can never maintain this contradictory rule of russian political nationalism in the midst of all the guccis , pradas , mercedes , bmws and edm parties currently roaming the wilds of moscow and st. petersburg . 
  everytime i see russia , i see two things : i see one part of russia as a land of supermodels , american fast food , mercedes mafias and dutch big room house djs selling massive concerts in moscow and kazantip . 
  and then there 's another part of russia that tries to be militaristic , ultra-orthodox , anti-west and meddles in their neighbours to destroy their european aspiration . 
  those two things do n't mix . 
  and when the two eventually collides , it will become a fucking disaster and i do n't know how russia will deal with that within a year or two , which ironically will be the 100th year of the october revolution . 
  jesus christ france . 
  our unemployment rate for the past 5 years has been 10 % already , which is worse than asian countries . 
  ca n't we just legalize drugs so that banlieusards and young graduates get jobs in pot farms and drug dispensaries or something ? 
  but not no country for old men that 's for sure . 
  that 's actually a compliment . 
  austin is one of the greatest cities in the us and the state 's inanity gave us no country for old men and bernie . 
  poland , croatia and bulgaria : the texas of europe til . 
  damn germany what the fuck ? 
  do n't you have any better fetishes to fap at , like netorare or something ? 
  u mad . 
  peter molyneux has n't release a good game in 18 years . 
  yeah , but did stephen harper gave obama a copy of deus ex : human revolution ? 
  check mate . 
  and besides , i do n't see canada releasing that many e-sports or fgc champions . 
  the most famous fgc player in canada is woolie , and he got his ass kicked by daigo umehara in the first round !, 
  the most a canadian would ever get to an e-sports champion was when ally got into 4th place in smash at mlg dallas 2010 . 
  in terms of the current gaming environment , i 'd put europe over canada every day . 
  but dire straits is better than the beatles . 
  the thing though is that china dominated the international 2014 , then i have doubts about koreans taking over the chinese in dota2 . 
  koreans do n't give a fuck about smash . 
  well , in terms of the rest of europe then yeah it 's underdeveloped . 
  but both france and poland are pretty much videogame powerhouses next to japan and the usa . 
  ubisoft is as big as ea and activision , whereas poland is churning out amazing games year after year , and the polish are fucking proud of it , especially when you have donald tusk giving a copy of the witcher 2 to president obama ( ps : triss is best girl ) . 
  the thing though is that poland is a country that thrives on the popularity of pc gaming after the end of the cold war to the point of tusk-obama witcher diplomacy , whereas [ videogames are considered an art form in france ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html?_r=0 ) and thus studios and developers can get tax breaks from the government .
