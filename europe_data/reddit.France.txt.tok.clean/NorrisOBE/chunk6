  and currently france is developing its e-sports scene and fighting games scene , with olivier hay winning usfiv at evo 2014 and kayane winning ssfivae at evo 2010 . 
  speaking of which , sweden has dominated the e-sports scene for years with them winning the recent 2014 mlg anaheim event for super smash brothers . 
  sweden is also the home to dice ( battlefield 4 ) and starbreeze , and ex-starbreeze employees made the excellent wolfenstein new order . 
  compare it to the uk and other european countries where there is a huge hysteria against video games by the government . 
  it 's difficult to get widespread support for development of video game as an artform when you have the bbc doing [ shit like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oplool1mcvu ) . 
  the only respectable studios to come out of the uk are rockstar games and they get huge flaks every single time from the british press for the gta series . 
  and it does n't help that the only thing british e-sports are good at are call of duty , [ which i 'm pretty sure the british government would be ashamed of ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7hbcku_-cm ), 
  or baldwins, 
  what is your daily work routine ? 
  what do you fucking expect ? 
  syrians are not stupid . 
  they 're smart enough to survive all the way to europe . 
  c'est pourqui le langue officiel du / r/europe doit etre francais, 
  [ well , majority of syrians who speak french are already here . 
  ] ( http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/syria/france-and-syria/political-relations-6414/article/graphic-france-host-country-for ) and we are willing to accept more only if they are willing to be a part of french society . 
  tell that to carly fiorina and donald trump . 
  america is bringing 10,000 next year which is a lot but the arab-populated cities of dearborn can accomodate around 30,000 refugees . 
  in fact , the refugee crisis is going to be the main foreign policy talk of the 2016 presidential elections . 
  do n't put your dick in crazy . 
  also , she 's 13 . 
  i think america needs to bring in more since they already have the infrastructure for syrian immigrants with cities like dearborn and newark having huge arab and muslim populations compared to most of europe . 
  uruguay has been bringing in refugees since pepe mujica 's term . 
  yes i am a regular in scw, 
  exactly . 
  and syria is not like iraq . 
  in iraq , the shiite militias , peshmergas , turkmens and isf are co-operating with each other , though their co-operation has little to do with iraqi unity and more to do with defending their ethnicities/sects/tribes . 
  in syria , everyone is fighting eachother . 
  alliances come and go every 2 months . 
  the fsa northern front allies with the ypg while the fsa southern front allies with is/daesh . 
  the ypg allies with the saa in hasakah while the saa is fighting the ypg outside hasakah . 
  the snc is against assad but refuses to support the ypg . 
  daesh fights jabhat al-nusra at the west while allies with jabhat al-nusra against the saa on the south . 
  it 's a big mess . 
  you 're welcome, 
  i think we banned some of his alts . 
  they are still well travelled in the middle east though , which makes their willingness to move to europe much more understandable . 
  hey i 'm just basing on what i know having lived in the middle east myself . 
  and besides , many arab parents sends their kids to do engineering courses . 
  it 's a common stereotype . 
  what do you know about syrians ? 
  [ there 's a wikipedia on syrian education before the revolution . 
  syria does have one of the highest literacy rates in all of mena ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_syria ) [ and syrians make up huge number of hajj pilgrimages amongst middle easterners ] ( https://books.google.com.my/books?id=2uk3gh6xruuc&amp;pg=pa126&amp;lpg=pa126&amp;dq=statistics+on+hajj+countries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ukw8gsq9vj&amp;sig=it0_xz6wunnmth0kcfeb6jcbg_c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=statistics%20on%20hajj%20countries&amp;f=false ) i too have been to mecca , and i was like `` i do not want to live here '' . 
  i bet majority of syrians would be like that too , you know . 
  you have to remember that syrians before the revolution are well-travelled within the region . 
  majority of syrians have visited neighbouring nations and most of them have done religious pilgrimages to saudi arabia , iran and/or israel . 
  it makes sense that they do not want to resettle into neighbouring arab countries when they know a lot about the middle east by their experiences . 
  and i do n't see any problem with integration by syrians when syrian people are well-educated and speak languages other than arabic . 
  when you have syrians who can speak english , french , aramaic , kurdish , turkish , russian and persian , then i do n't see a problem with them assimilating into german society and speaking german . 
  most syrians before the revolution are also doctors and engineers , and germany being an engineering powerhouse has always been welcoming of engineers from various countries . 
  after all , it 's one of the most innovative countries in europe and i do n't see what 's so negative about that . 
  syrians are not barbarians . 
  and that is my whole gripe to the western response of the syrian refugee crisis . 
  the easiest parts of french and latin/romance languages in general are the parts that shares words with the english languages . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow_peril  the term refers to perceptions regarding the skin color of east asians , the fear that the mass immigration of asians threatened the wages of whites and their standards of living , the fear that asians had some sort of unnatural sexuality that threatened western women with rape and the fear that they would eventually take over and destroy western civilization , replacing it with their ways of life and values . 
  the term also refers to the fear and or belief that east asian societies would attack and wage wars with western societies and eventually wipe them out and lead to their total annihilation whether it be their societies , people , ways of life , history , and or cultural values . 
  sound familiar ? 
  i 'll repeat this once and i 'll repeat it again : this is literally yellow peril 2.0 . 
  edit : nice brigading bro . 
  stickied . 
  palestine is considered an `` observer '' nation by the un since 2012 . 
  good . 
  ah , just like the early 2000s . 
  `` those who chose to ignore history are doomed to repeat it '', 
  no one follows fatwas really . 
  there 's a fatwa banning yoga in malaysia , and yet yoga is getting more popular amongst muslims in malaysia and indonesia . 
  i am a muslim and i watch football , my imam and ustazs back in malaysia and support manchester united . 
  please do n't provide misinformation and claiming that you 're an `` expert '', 
  but on the bright side , i get to see a post-apocalyptic wasteland with my own eyes !, 
  i regularly pray at the grand mosque of paris on fridays . 
  i 've seen blacks and arabs pray together , and so do white and asians . 
  can we counter those by building more sufi and shiite mosques ? 
  muslims can pray at any mosque that belongs to any sect of islam , which is something that for some reason europeans are too naive to take advantage of . 
  `` it 's okay when front national does it '', 
  syria was formerly a part of the hashemite kingdom and king abdullah of jordan took in syrian refugees over the fact that syria was a former hashemite subject . 
  and the hashemites are a sworn enemy of the wahhabis and the house of saud . 
  if that 's the case then why not pressure america to pressure saudi arabia ? 
  they 've been buddies with the saud house for 70 years . 
  jordan is a hashemite sunni kingdom that has accepted syrian refugees since 2011 . 
  they 're also friends of israel , iran and the kurdistan regional government . 
  however , their stability is being threatened by a wahhabi saudi state down south that took over the entire hejaz kingdom from the hashemites , especially when one of their fighter pilots was beheaded by is/daesh . 
  it has little to do with religion and more of the fact that wahhabis are a bunch of prosperity gospel cunts aided by america for 70 years . 
  seriously , you guys think that sunni wahhabi and ibadi states would accept shiite refugees ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's hak-par and hdp which represents kurdish minority down south . 
  i do n't know anything about turkish politics though . 
  i might be wrong . 
  and without erdogan and assad , the kurds would 've had its own nation in 24 hours, 
  i disagree . 
  it can be done . 
  look at / r/syriancivilwar, 
  that 's the thing . 
  the kurds are neither beholden to any arab political power , which means that america , europe and russia can support them without ever indirectly funding any radical islamist movements . 
  the failure for the west to support an independent kurdistan for 90 years is one of the biggest western foreign policy failures in the middle east next to the ousting of mossadegh . 
  the syrian civil war has forced the west to side with either the kurds or the sunni arabs/turks , and if they chose the latter then they will create the biggest battleground of modern islamism . 
  an independent kurdistan run by secularist barzanis and ypg creates a natural buffer zone between israel , sunni saudi arabia and shiite iran . 
  what else can the west do ? 
  if assad goes , then syria will be overrun by islamists fighting each other . 
  no one wants to see al-nusra fight daesh near the israeli , jordanian and saudi borders . 
  that 's the worst case scenario in the middle east . 
  that 's why the west should just fund the ypg and led them to fight for an independent kurdistan that joins with the iraqi kurdistan region . 
  they 're the true victors of the syrian civil war as they 're not beholden to a saudi proxy ( snc/fsa/daesh ) and an iranian proxy ( syria/hezbollah/saa ),
