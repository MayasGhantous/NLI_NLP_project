  wow , this is fucking awful . 
  congratulations you fucking idiots , you just flared more islamist sentiments in the country . 
  apparently this was linked elsewhere , the poster asked politely that it not be shared beyond the ukip sub ... https://www.reddit.com/r/ukipparty/comments/3hy8o3/can_someone_have_a_word/cubnkhx, 
  what shocks is that why are they crossing macedonia at all . 
   right-thinking progressives what ? 
   even the republican party of today is radically progressive compared to the thinkers of the old right , all of whom were purged from positions of influence . 
  since when was homophobia and xenophobia a leftist ideology ? 
  [ `` i 'd get along very well with putin '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-id-get-along-very-well-with-vladimir-putin/ ), 
  [ donald trump 's policies are also borderline fascist too . 
  ] ( http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/donald_trump_is_an_actual_fascist_what_his_surging_popularity_says_about_the_gop_base/ ), 
  the same thing will happen in 2017 . 
  oh man , what a shame . 
  jean marie le pen was my source of keks for years now . 
  i ca n't deal with this . 
  france needs its own donald trump , and unfortunately marine le pen is not crazy enough . 
  yes , they 're popular but not popular enough for the presidency as the same situation will happen again in 2002 where le pen loses to chirac as people started reading le pen 's policies in the last minute and said `` lol nope '' . 
  there is absolutely no difference between the le pens and donald trump . 
  they get popular because of typical right-wing crazy populist crap but the fates remain the same . 
  in fact , both trump and le pen have the exact same policies in regards to pretty much everything . 
  is it ? 
  i 've been many leftists and libertarians criticising saudi arabia and its relationship with the west without being called `` islamophobes '' . 
  as / u/optimalg said i bet in the eyes of many racists they were n't thinking of bosnians and indonesians when it comes to `` muslims '', 
   that both nazism and islam are ideologies with certain things in common . 
  and so is christianity , buddhism and hinduism . 
  in fact , nazism had more influences from far eastern religions than islam . 
  [ hell , there are tons of hindu and buddhist neo-nazi movements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esoteric_nazism ) i 'd say that islam shares more with conservative orthodox judaism as both are pretty strict in values and traditional norms . 
  yeah , and the mosque of paris saved thousands of jews . 
  also , many algerian muslims participated in the free french forces . 
  what 's your point ? 
  because `` muslims '' are also a word used to describe arabs and pakistanis . 
  i 've seen arab christians being called muslim for some reason . 
  hey , come on . 
  montpellier is not bad . 
  montpellier and perpignan . 
  very underrated cities , solely because of less tourism compared to cote d'azur . 
  body language and pronunciation , bro . 
  what the fuck is `` tabarnak '' ? 
  `` yeah , listen to putin . 
  we accept new recruits '' - is/daesh, 
  ah it seems that erdogan and the wahhabists are entering the prosperity gospel market, 
  we would look into that . 
  being both malaysian and french , the prospect of representing both would be fantastic . 
  but can you stop him , his time is now ? 
  i 'm already here . 
  ps : is hollande pulling a cena ? 
  france is a very musical society , so we are pretty similar to japan in terms of music : the youths love rap and typical french pop . 
  we also love french house and any current dance music trends right now . 
  personally , i find musicians like zaz as generic and i fucking hate christophe mae . 
  fuck him and his awful voice . 
  french rap has still yet to enter the cloud rap trend of a$ ap rocky and lil b but they still produce great gangsta stuff . 
  zuglou bands like magic system sometimes hit france and i love zuglou . 
  there has n't been any actual development in french dance music . 
  french house still sounds either like deep house or big room electro house . 
  compare it to british uk bass scene or the internet seapunk/vaporwave stuff france is pretty lacking in development of dance music , but they still produce great stuff . 
  french people still look highly at the chanson genre . 
  we still love our aznavours , lamas , reggianis and hardys . 
  it 's great . 
  i thought you guys jerk off about all those great edm djs you have out there . 
   france 's hipsters are much cooler than the ones by me . 
  well , [ lyon is hipster capital and is basically portland with much much better food . 
  ] ( http://www.redbull.com/en/skateboarding/stories/1331666496812/the-scene-in-lyon-the-skate-capital-of-france ), 
  well , i do know that 24 % of the romanian population can speak french , either fluently or casually . 
  and besides , both french and romanian are easily understood by each other ( french and romanian share the same language family ) . 
  there 's also a big romanian population in france . 
  yeah i 'm familiar with people like dylan roof, 
  a question : since bulgaria is a member of la francophonie , how francophonic are bulgarians ? 
  if i ask them `` vous parlez francais '' or `` vie govorite frenski ? '', 
  would they mostly say `` oui/da '' or `` non/ne '' ? 
  i do love going around europe and asking if they speak french hoping that i can start random conversations in french . 
  taqiyya is a shia practice meant to hide themselves from sunnis . 
  i 'm shocked that some in / r/europe still falls for this shit, 
  close . 
  i 've seen portlandia . 
  at least hipsters bring in culture , awesome music and cool sports like skating and bmx . 
  i 'd rather have a city run by hipsters than neo-nazis . 
  i 've been a muslim since birth . 
  i have never raped anyone , nor have i ever owned a slave . 
  am i doing it wrong ? 
  which is ironic because of the first converts to islam was a slave freed by muhammad pbuh ( or a relative of muhammad ) himself, 
  look , you may be new here , but / r/hentai ( nsfw ) is where many top minds collaborate , and routinely outsmart the most well funded , well equipped and diabolical organizations on earth . 
  how do we do it ? 
  top thinkers , experts on every field , unparalleled investigative skills and fearlessness . 
  i would trust a top comment here over pretty much any news source , especially a mainstream source , any day . 
  as a cautious optimist , is there any chance of nato and other european institutions playing a role in future growth ? 
  maybe more science and arts projects thanks to fast internet ? 
  i 'd love to build a particle collider in romania that allows for bigger cooperation between european and russian scientists . 
   in france , allergic kids must bring their own meals at school . 
  so why not just do that ? 
  american muslim kids either bring their own food or eat kosher at school . 
   no one is stopping them . 
  they can bring their own food . 
  so why is this an issue ? 
  why the fuck wo n't the principals say `` byof '' ? 
  there should be more options for kids . 
  if kids do n't want to eat pork because of faith or allergy or whatever , then who are we to stop them ? 
  let them have something else . 
  paging / u/here _ comes_the_king /, 
  britain will never leave nato , even under a government run by a pot-smoking hippie . 
  do you want another british government bringing its citizens to another war hosted by trump/walker/perry / rubio/bush/paul / christie/kasich/fiorina / huckabee ? 
  well , to be fair tsipras also said the same thing and yet greece 's relationship with russia is no different than ever .
