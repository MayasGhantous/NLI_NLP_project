  i am sure that england beating scotland to the euro football cup is enough , for her , to trigger a independance referendum . 
  we should try to put our prince albert instead . 
  libya is not a middle eastern country, 
  give me one case in the history were sarkozy is not related . 
  i wonder i the right question is : does a citizen choose the nation he is born into ? 
  he even quickly eliminate him what a righteous man . 
  we can still hate the chechen, 
  true but they make funny discussion, 
  the sweet irony, 
  i agree that there is probably a lot of cultural differences between people of different countries . 
  the economic background is off course different . people value may be different . 
  but i do n't think that those difference are enough to stop the establishement of a true democratic system in the long term . 
  may be in the short term , but the debt crisis and the migrant crisis , told me ( with the appearance of pan-european opinion ) , that we are already in the middle term where we begin to realize the common interest . 
  for the wolf story : scenario one : the sheep can ask one wolf to protect him from the other wolf . 
  in exchange this wolf would be able to eat the whole sheep . 
  he make the same pact with the other . 
  at the moment one wolf is dead and the other near death the sheep finish them . 
  scenario two : the sheep form an alliance with both wolf . 
  if they do n't eat him he open the door of the sheepfold at night . 
  for the rest i indeed think that people from the same background will have the same spectrum of view , ( except if of course is individual interest are against ) . 
  i do n't say that they old identic view.i just say that there are more likely to have enough in comon to have two or three school of thought who can be supported by several political party . 
  exemple : liberal party supported by people who do n't like to pay taxes . 
  i am sure that a lot of people inside all european nations do n't like to pay taxes and are ready to vote for this kind of party . 
  they can vote by adhesion to a pan european ideal or just by convenience . 
  i did n't say nationalist i use the term nationalism . 
  because the idea of nationalist are really similar ( even if there is of course some difference ) among european country . 
  they even have two pan-european party . 
  see interest bring people together . 
  i was really surprised first that a rape affairs unrelated to immigration made it to r/europe . 
  then a lot of people press the fact that they are african . 
  then i am less surprised . 
  here some number for a lot of rape who will never make it to r/news and r/worldnews https://rainn.org/statistics http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/50-facts-rape_b_2019338.html, 
  there are if they have the nationality of one european country . 
  what did they have to do with that ? 
  by the democratic law the sheep will have to seek alliance with one of the wolf . 
  there is more in common between people of the same social category ( ex farmer ) that between people of the same country ( famer and banker ) . the only thing slowing this communication process is nationalism . 
  merkel president !!!!, 
  this is democracy, 
  if it was white guys it would not be here in r/europe . 
  it would be in the local news category and no one of us would know about it . 
  if they were not austrian you can be sure that it would be wrighten in the headline . 
  edit : well it seems that i was wrong.this is quite surprising, 
  not part of the union but why not . 
  or some european land in the american continent . 
  ( the other way will make you live in a graveyard ), 
  gain the trait zealous +1 piety/month +30 opinion with other zealous taxis of same religion -10 opinion towards opposites : cynical or sympathy for other religions -50 opinion towards tourists infidels, 
  do n't know , they are never interviewed . 
  but they exist . 
  it is the number of pedestrian who do n't agree with this statement, 
  +10 relation with your religious group -20 relation with other religious groups +5 % chance that the remove kebab event occurs, 
  anti-israel , and anti-semitic are two different thing . 
  even if i concede that a lot of anti sionist , and anti israel are just hidden anti-semite . 
  not if the critical thinker are ridiculed and marginalized by more numerous racist and biggot . 
  if we did n't intervene kadafi would have fall , or if it stay in place it would end up with a syria like situation . 
  non of them is profitable . 
  we just speed up the process . 
  we ca n't , even if we effectively do , choose their government in place of their people . 
  kadafi might have been good for us but not for is people . 
  the instability who result the intervention is our fault because we did n't stay long enough . 
  why ankara ? 
  if i remember my history class it was not a big city ? 
  it was not is home town or something like that ? 
  there is a big list and not all of them was terrorist . 
  instantaned ramen does n't count as pasta . 
  they are in the college survival pack category .

  if jesus reborn now in bethlehem there is some chance to find him here . 
  ( or in america according to the mormon ), 
  i am ok with it . 
  as long as i am not a soldier . 
  and the german army do n't go to paris . 
  if someone in europe can , it is us, 
  they do n't want to come here . 
  they do n't apply to asylum , they just want to go to britain . 
  except that when they have a divorce we end up with a world war . 
  well the day after the european annonce of the quota plan ( last year ) , valse announced that it would be against . 
  and the refugee will overthrow us by not wanting to stay here ? 
  \u266b fall for russia and britain ; summer for ireland and netherlands ... \u266b, 
  literally yes .

  she must be 33.33 percent norwegian, 
  2 kind of heavy drinkers here . 
  the noble one , who drink wine , who drink a little to much , but still someone responsible and respectful . 
  and the non wine drinker , drunkard this one is irresponsible , he is the one who drink , drive and kill . 
  it seems that in the french mentality ( at least from what i can see in my entourage and in the media ) you can drink as much as you want as long as it is wine . 
  this is the royalist one . 
  and then they came first . 
  the last one was a message for you not a hard fact . 
  this is how it goes . 
  greece vote for syriza to end the austerity . 
  syriza negotiate and fail against the austerity camp they made a referendum about accepting or not austerity measures . 
  this was supposed to be used as a mean of negotiation ( a way to say that grecian people will not accept any austerity measures ) . 
  austerity camp threaten them that voting no would mean a grexit . 
  greec vote no to austerity .
