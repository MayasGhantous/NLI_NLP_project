those are very famous as well : * [ my mom said i could ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5_nlm6fj8u ) * [ you push the boundaries ( plug for the french idiom ) too far , maurice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asc40_mpzju ),

  i did n't know they were popular in spain . 
   it 's the natural habitat of supermarket chains wut ? 
  a little bit like the difference between [ this ] ( http://www.immobilier-occitanie.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/647/2016/02/maison-de-hameau-sud-aveyron-2.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.gatel-texier.notaires.fr/images_biens/350263410-1.jpg ) . 
  brittany is a former mountain chain . 
  several million years ago , it was higher than the current alps chain . 
  nowadays , it 's just a rolling countryside . 
  the south have tiles while the north use slates for the roof . 
  i sing in german when i 'm drunk . 
  and it 's awful : /, 
  you have to read a text in catalan . 
  it 's really close to the french language !, 
  i love history . 
  sadly , i think there is not enough jobs and opportunities in this matter , so i study law right now . 
  haha , it 's catchy !, 
  * [ manhattan-kaboul ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izbnztj4xwo ) ( a very good song , but the translation is quite meh ) * [ jean-jacques goldman - n\u00e9 en 17 a leidenstadt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4gbutj3hai ) about germany , mostly during the wwii . 
  he is wondering how he would have behaved if he had been german during this period . 
  and he just said he would never know .

  i 'm just white and clean-shaven . 
  i ca n't answear . 
  yeah , it 's quite weird , because i only went in private and catholic schools . 
  and i learned a lot about the colonisation of africa but never had a course about napoleon and the restauration . 
  but private schools in brittany are quite normal though . 
  except the fact we never have strikes , there is no real difference with the public ones . 
  and i 'm 22 . 
  weird . 
  i mosly learned about the colonies in africa `` in general '' , but nothing about america . 
  i only heard about the 7 years war when i was at college . 
  we had a lot of courses about the myth of the white man 's burden , the way we educated the african population like when they learned the french map , but not the map of their own country . 
  the history of france , but not their own . 
  or the fact that some of them were very educated , but we refused them jobs because , well , they are black . 
  we also critiqued the book of tintin in congo . 
  and finaly , we learned a lot about the pieds noir in algeria , the fact we refused to give to the natives the french citizenship , even though they fought for us in the wws , the fln , the torture made by the french army , and the algerian war in general . 
  edit : and also about the differenciation between settlement colonies and exploitation colonialism . 
  contrary to uk , spain and portugal , france prefered the latter . 
  we learned also a little bit about the code noir , the triangular trade and then , the decolonisation . 
  * an american woman who was really surprised that we do n't all wear stripped shirts and berets . 
  '' * in fact you just look ... normal * '' . 
  after that , she finished in a full patriotic speech , because obviously , european wanted to look like americans . 
  that 's why we have the same clothes than them . 
  one of the american guy who was in his group said me she was one of the most stupid person he ever met . 
  i believe him . 
  * some chinese girls who were doing a college exchange with my university . 
  they went in france because they thought france was very romantic and would like a french husband ( because they are all womanizer , right ? ) . 
  but well , in the rural part of brittany , i think their expectations were way too high . 
  futurosope is pretty interesting . 
  you have attractions like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vsjyhrbpcy#t=1m08s ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hugfupit9l8#t=1m45 ) . 
  it 's an interesting concept because while they do n't use `` real '' thrill rides , but just machines , they create the sentation you are inside one . 
  they spread draught and even water on your face and your seat move according the plot of a story . 
  you put a virtual reality headset on your face , and become the commander of a spaceship for example . 
  it 's really cool . 
  at 1h30 from the futuroscope , there is le [ puy du fou ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_erm68ziz0 ) . 
  it 's a famous theme park in france , but it 's not an amusement one , so i do n't think it fits your criterias . 
  except that , le [ parc d'ast\u00e9rix ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=parc+ast%c3%a9rix&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewib-vx098huahxlaxqkhcudapwq_auibygc&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=549#safe=active&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=parc+asterix+attraction&amp;imgrc=69-myom22aswim: ) and of course [ eurodisney ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqwsq5hxr2o ) . 
  * [ orgues d'ille-sur-t\u00eat ] ( http://dailygeekshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/orgues-6.jpg ) * [ lac du salagou ] ( http://www.panoram-art.com/galerie/france/11793-france-herault-lac-de-salagou-panorama-sentucq.h.jpg ) * [ palais id\u00e9al de facteur cheval ] ( http://www.facteurcheval.com/files/contenu/photos/facade-est.jpg ) * [ ocres de rustrel ] ( http://media.topito.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/22-600x450.jpg ) * [ gorges du verdon ] ( http://vizeo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gorges-du-verdon.jpg ), 
  and `` bestah '' for young teenager girls . 
  * dude : mec , type * bro : pote , fr\u00e8re ( brother ) , ami ( formal ), 
  it 's quite popular here , especially among the women . 
  i would say it 's the 5th most popular sport in france , but nba matchs are not that much followed . 
  yeah , and it 's easier to know the agreement of the past participle with the genre of the subject . 
  je suis surprise . 
  * [ salut c'est cool in general ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk6mhwafbue ) * i 'm a flower ... * * i 'm a beautiful flower ... * * i 'm more beautiful than a rose and i smell better than a lilac * * who am i ? 
  * * i 'm you * * [ grand jd - j'aime les licornes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_he0cy55vw ) i like licorns and their beautiful horn , they have a coat whith looks like clouds , they are so beautiful with all their friends , even if they love sodomy . 
  * [ jacques - dans la radio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gozdgqo8yv8 ) * [ bratisla boys - stash , stash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpe1bjp8-4w ) * [ bo le lavabo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mksk-3yivx0 ) , which means : the washbasin is beautiful , the bidet is ugly . 
  even when they swear , it sounds like french !, 
  guess what does mean : `` ves-te 'n a prendre pel cul , fill de puta . '', 
  i already read some catalan text in barcelona . 
  your post remind me this [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fzzi9/les_fran%c3%a7ais_%c3%a0_rome/ ) . 
  and in france , it 's the same spirit . 
  not as much as italians , but it 's still a problem . 
  when i search `` la france est '' ( france is ) , i found `` foutue '' ( screwed ) , and `` morte '' ( dead ) . 
  yeah . 
  i know a uruguayan woman who moved in france when she was 16 . 
  now she is 22 and have a perfect accent . 
  i was surprised when she said me she have n't got the french nationality . 
  but her grandmother was french and she often travelled in france for vacation when she was a kid , that 's maybe why she speak it so perfectly . 
  and i also had a brazilian friend which accent was near perfect , even thought she lived in france for only 1 year . 
  when i was in paris with her , some sellers thought she was french and i was brittish ( ! ), 
  because i had `` a little accent '' ( rich coming from an algerian seller ) . 
  i 'm a native french speaker and never lived in another country . 
  i guess people whose native language is a latin one can speak french with no accent if they stay here for a long time . 
  but it 's not the case for germanic and slavic speaking people . 
  brittish because i 'm redhead with a pale skin i guess . 
  there already had been some french people who called me rosbif ( if i 've never spoke with them ) and when i wear a green hat , i become full irish . 
  when i was in london for 2 month , there was at least 1 tourist who asked me directions per day . 
  my german friend said me i was a tourist magnet  but when i begin to speak , my strong french accent clarify everything . 
  edit : forgot a word . 
  well , a good movie about napeolon i guess . 
  hollywood never made one about him . 
  and not my country , but a movie about this [ badass canadian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a9o_major ) could be quite interesting . 
  the first movie would be about his exploit in the wwii , and a sequel would be created for the korean war . 
  honestly , if he had been american , i 'm pretty sure the movies would have already existed . 
  not a much as uk . 
  i would chose uk . 
  germany would have been a cool partner as well , but they do n't have as much experience as uk in this matter . 
  plus , if we stay with germany , it would be an european empire , while uk is much more ambitious in term of imperialism ( and they have nukes ) .
