  why not just dubbing them then ? 
  i was really piss off when i heard they will remake `` intouchable '' . 
  yes , i guess . 
  i have an argentinan friend who did pretty much the same thing thatwhat you want to do . 
  she had no problem . 
  where and when will you be in france ? 
  it 's just to have an idea and help you to find some good festivals in this area  with the [ shengen area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area ) , it 's pretty easy to travel in europe , since there is no control borders . 
  if you are adventurous , i recommend you the application blablacar and couch surfing if you want to save money and to meet the locals from europe !, 
  we worked a lot about that , of course . 
  for example , we closed more than 20 mosquees since december 2015 because they were spreading a radical message , a douzen of radical imam had been expelled , we created a [ `` fiche s '' system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiche_%22s%22 ) with a high surveillance on 10,500 suspected of being islamic radicals , our parlement is trying to find a solution to avoid foreigner financing while respecting the strong french secularism , they also put in place a center of `` deradicalization '' which obviously did n't work etc. . . 
  which country ? 
   i would choose france ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  brazil . 
  poor guy . 
  i live at 10 minutes from the [ tumulus saint-michel ] ( http://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/1/30/44/34/20150522/ob_62f1f9_tumulus-coupe.jpg ) , in carnac , which had been build in 4500 bc . 
  according to wikipedia , [ it 's the third oldest building in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_buildings#by_age ) . 
  near this tumulus , there is the carnac stones , which had been erected at some stage during the neolithic period , probably around 3300 bce . 
  [ there are more than 3000 aligned prehistoric standing stones in this area ] ( http://img.ev.mu/images/attractions/4526/1605x642/6222.jpg ) . 
  in the neighbour town , there is the [ saint-goustan port ] ( http://mushu7272.free.fr/bretagne/5stgoustan/stgoustan.jpg ) where i used to go with some friend for drinking . 
  on 3 december 1776 , benjamin franklin landed in this port to ask for french aid in the war of independence . 
  it must be strenuous : o, 
   i have a cat called findus fortunately , it 's not a horse . 
  estonia . 
   co-opted the white oval with place name inside it never seen this one where i live . 
   i am from [ country ] and i 'm proud to be a [ countryman ] '' in france , we do n't use national stickers , but regional one . 
  for example , i saw a lot of [ those stickers ] ( http://aws-cf.caradisiac.com/prod/mesimages/46123/dsc00706.jpg ) here in brittany , on at least 15 % of the cars . 
  it 's the logo `` a l'aise breizh '' which is quite popular here . 
  it even became a sort of regional identity symbol . 
  i also noticed some stickers from corsica as well . 
  ^ ^ oh ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ just ^ ^ that ^ ^ we ^ ^ often ^ ^ use ^ ^ this ^ ^ word ^ ^ in ^ ^ french ^ ^ but ^ ^ not ^ ^ with ^ ^ the ^ ^ same ^ ^ meaning ^ ^ ( it 's ^ ^ more ^ ^ `` pride '' '' ^ ^ than ^ ^ nationalism ) ^ ^ and ^ ^ wanted ^ ^ to ^ ^ explain ^ ^ you ^ ^ : /, 
  it 's a word which has exactly the same meaning that american exceptionalism . 
  it 's a mixed between nationalism and patriotism so the '' * we should impose our culture to other countries since we have the best one in the world * '' spirit . 
  this word had been invented because of the `` legend of the soldier nicolas chauvin '' during the napoleonic area . 
  a soldier who still fought even if he losed 3 fingers and a part of his skull . 
  chauvinism is not a french beaviour as / u/arvinadystopia implied , it 's just where the word had been created . 
  the same way , we do n't say `` french sadism '' , `` italian machiavelism '' or `` english darwinism '' . 
  it 's stupid . 
  it 's just chauvinism . 
  do n't worry , it 's true that maitre gims ( and indilla ) has a lot of success abroad , which is pretty great for a french speaking singer . 
  he has his place here , 
  oh , yes , forgot him ... 
  i do n't really like his music to be fair , and i do n't consider him as a rapper . 
  and since i add `` others '' categorie in the rush , he was a collaterale damage : /, 
  and here again , i do n't think it 's a good idea to military intervene in this case . 
  as you said , people are completly brainwashed in nk . 
  they learn at their birth that kim jong-un is a god , and that their country is exceptional . 
  some people had been sent to concentration camps , that 's true . 
  but the majority of the population is patriotic/nationalistic and are completly impregnated by the regime ideas . 
  they learned when they were child that americans are devil . 
  if the usa attack nk , do you think they will see you as savior or opressor ? 
  i encompass the european countries , they do n't make the distinction btw ( all white men ) . 
  nah , the best is an implosion of the regime ( like urss ) which will happen one day or another , the implication of china/russia , his neighbour and allies , instead of a western coalition and/or maybe trying to destabilize the regime from the inside ( corruption etc ) . 
  then , our biggest role will be mostly financial by helping sk to integrate nk to avoid the complete bankruptcy of sk and to prevent instability . 
  i think it looks a little bit like the kind of nationalism/imperialism we had in europe in the past , but in a less agressive way . 
  maybe our agressivity was more intense because of the history and rivalry we had with our neighbours , something usa never experimented . 
  i guess this kind of attitude looks pretty puerile and naive for foreigners . 
  i never met someone saying '' [ my country is the greatest country on earth ] ( https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/757604220661030912 ) '' irl nor in internet for example , especially in europe . 
  they would have been mocked by the rest of the population or categorized as a nationalist bigot . 
  but it 's not the case in usa ( well , for a big part of your population ) in fact , i think this kind of attitude may be dangereous . 
  if you always turn a blind eye to the problems of your country ( and all countries have problems ) , you ca n't progress . 
  plus , you would think it 's legetimate to intervene in other countries policy , since you have the best system in the world to offer . 
  it 's only `` charity '' and you want to share it . 
  tbh , the way americans brought `` freedom and democracy '' in some countries remind me the whole `` white man 's burden '' that the population believed several centuries ago . 
  as i said before , it 's just the way of thinking that i find similar , i do n't want to be misunderstood . 
  i 'm not saying american are racist colonist , just that the population have the same naive approach in term of geopolitical relationships . 
  the population really thought they were helping the colonies by bringing `` civilisation '' to the `` primitives '' . 
  of course , the elites were n't charitable and mostly thought in term of economy . 
  it somewhat looks the same than when some people say '' [ we brought them freedom , they should be gratefull ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/57eypv/iraq_we_could_have_just_killed_the_men_raped_the/ ) '' while the elite was mostly searching oil . 
  of course , all countries use the same stratagem . 
  a politician will never say `` well , this country has a lot of oil . 
  we want to steal it '' and it 's not something typical american . 
  it 's just the amount of people blindly trusting their country which is above the world average . 
  the only country which recently acted like the americans was turkey ... 
  we have the [ french house ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_house ) !,

  i feel bad now :( i will edit it for u , 
  thank you for the correction !, 
  i do n't really know handball , so it 's more a stereotype than a reality ... 
  my favorite thread of this kind is this [ one ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/france/comments/2srpjt/france_strikes_me_as_a_rather_authoritarian/cns96i4/ ) . 
  after a long and good explanation from / u/kookanoodles explaining why france was n't an authoritarian country just because we are more strict concerning freedom of speach than in the usa , op answered :  thank you for proving my point about france . 
  i 'm going to make sure to tell everyone to never go there and that your country is a police state . 
  god , why is the world outside of the us have no civil liberties ? 
  i really mean that . 
  can you name a country with as much rights as the us ? 
  then , of course , he had been linked on / r/shitamericanssay and / r/subredditdrama . 
  [ after some other complains from op , the moderator of / r/france decided later to ban him from the sub ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/france/comments/2srpjt/france_strikes_me_as_a_rather_authoritarian/cns9j37/ ) :  you want to see what the absence of free speech looks like ? 
   like this : get the fuck out . 
  banned . 
  op was obviously salty as fuck , and decided to whine in / r/conspiracy ... [ / r/conspiracy kicked him out as well !, 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2srvlg/banned_from_rfrance_just_because_i_criticized/ ) :'), 
  yes , but it 's [ les inconnus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyuzklrmsji ) . 
  the same way , i like when rowan atkinson or monthy python joke about french people , even if about french cowardise . 
  i also really laught at the sketch of palmashow on their movie max et leon where they were trying to convince the german they worth nothing by being their prisoner since they are french ( so they are as gentle as a lamp ) . 
  but on internet , gosh , americans really lack of originality . 
  there is maybe 3 surrender jokes in total , and i read it near once a day on the english internet . 
  plus , i never really find funny jokes about the death of the french soldiers in the wwi and the wwii . 
  it 's not a baseball match , guys , people died during this war . 
  no cheese and sauce on it ? 
  well , it 's just that i like the shape of those shoes , and that they are of good quality ( you can use them 10/15 years without problem ) .
