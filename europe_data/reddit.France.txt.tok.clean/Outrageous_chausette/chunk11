  it 's a good investment and they give a rock style to a lot of your outfits . 
  since i get them at 30 $ , it 's a pretty good deal , 
  depend of the kind of humor . 
  as i said before , i hate the surrender jokes because i find them disrepectful and overused . 
  it 's just a drag . 
  france : football : mostly italy , then germany , spain/portugal ( fuck you portugal ) rugby : i guess wales and england . 
  but i remember people were extremelly happy when we won against new zealand in 2007 , as if it was a miracle . 
  so i will add nz , even though it 's obviously one-way . 
  basket-ball : mostly spain . 
  handball : i guess scandinavian countries in general and croatia * . 
  i know french team is really good in handball , and often won the world cup . 
  but i do n't know which country will be their main rival ... 
  which kind of pizza ? 
  i know it  to be honest , for the moment they do n't hurt me at all , but they squeak a lot : /, 
  [ this one . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/44v8va/je_suis_un_am%c3%a9ricain_et_je_besoin_de_votre_aide/ ) sincerely , it was one of the most beautiful and interesting thread i read on reddit . 
  i get new doc martens made in england for only 30 $ !, 
  the former owner wore thoses shoes for less than 1 month , because it hurted her feet . 
  sincerely , seing the price of the others doc martens , they worth at least 80 $ . 
  but she did n't checked the other propositions ... , 
  i think it 's because some accents are really difficult to understand for a french speaker , especially if you do n't interact that much with foreigners . 
  for example , i watched the movie [ `` mommy '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3612616/ ) by xavier dolan with a friend . 
  they were all speaking french , but with a quebecer accent . 
  honeslty , without the substitles , it was incomprenhensible for us . 
  another day , a german which spoke fluently french said me in french `` the symbol of my city is a bear ( ours ) '' . 
  i did n't understand him . 
  he repeated `` un ours '' several time , but no way . 
  at the end , i understand that 's because he did n't prononced the `` s '' at the end of the word , so he was just saying `` un our '' which mean nothing . 
  see , just a little letter he did n't prononced correctly changed the sentence , so that 's not surprising this french guy did n't understand what `` manceau '' was . 
  oh , never been here , does it worth it ? 
  the price is pretty good and the programe seems really cool ( love iggy pop , phoenix and justice < 3 ), 
  which one ? 
  but , it would make it spongy , no ? 
  no , you have to freeze it . 
  and when you want your bread , you just have to bake it on the convection oven for 15 minutes . 
  i had been baptized but i 'm completely atheist ... 
  * we do n't have a surrender gene ( gosh , i hate this stereotype , it 's so irrespectious for our veterans ) * we do n't refuse to speak english because arrogance , we just are very bad at speaking it . 
  * we are not islamophobic . 
  * we are not under shakira law either . 
  * women shave . 
  i never met a french woman in my life with hairy armpits in public . 
  * we wash ourselves everyday . 
  * we do love baguette , wine and cheese . 
  and we consume it on a daily basis . 
  * we like as well frog legs and snails , but it 's not a common dish . 
  it 's forbiden to smoke inside now . 
  well , except in your own house , but even in this case , very few people smoke inside . 
  it 's not really the prononciation , it 's a word they use everyday and they do n't say that with a pejorative meaning . 
  it 's just that for me , those words have no sense . 
  it mean '' * people from outside the capital * '' . 
  when they want to go on holliday , some of them will just say '' * i 'm going in province this hollidays * '' . 
  not '' * i 'm going in lyon , in corsica , in la meuze etc * '' , just in province , so '' * outside of paris * '' . 
  plus , the way they say `` provincial '' is really weird for me . 
  it has no sens. 
  what if i met a parisian ** in paris ** and say '' * i like going in `` non-brittany '' during my hollidays * '' or '' * what ? 
  you never went in a starbuck in your life ? 
  it sound stupid and arrogant , no ? 
  i may have some ideas for you , but it 's pretty hard if you are under 18 years old ... * maybe in the hotel trade or restauration industry if they search a [ dishwasher ] ( https://candidat.pole-emploi.fr/candidat/rechercheoffres/resultats/a_plonge_france_01___p__________indifferent_______________________;jsessionid_candidat=trblyf1gbvjbprhp90c6ngf7v4vztl6pd5yhtw9nq2jzh1lfqgg1!1129439949 ) . 
  but sincerely , i do n't recommend it , especially if you do n't speak french . 
  it 's boring , and if you are here alone , it really do n't worth it . 
  * if i were you , i would try to pass some basic formations in `` organisation '' in austria . 
  in france , we have the bafa . 
  i guess the only equivalent in europe will be the `` scout disploma '' or cep in plus of a diploma for the first aids . 
  you will not won money this year , but later with a little bit more experience , you will have the opportunity to lead some itinerant summer camps in europe . 
  plus , during winter , you even may have the opportunity to be paid for skiing with childrens , it 's really cool  * after that ( or in plus of the formation ) , it 's not a `` work '' but mostly an international volontary work . 
  i remember i met a group of 20/25 years old spanish/english/german and french people in my city 2 years ago , who were working in a `` european building solidarity camp '' . 
  they were renovating some old building , and doing some archeologic researchs during the day . 
  of course , since they were a group of 20 young adults , they were more partying than working , but it seems like cool and a pretty funny experience ( they planned some festivals near here and a lot of tourism ) . 
  here are some website in [ french ] ( http://www.solidaritesjeunesses.org/projets.html#recherche ) and in [ german ] ( https://www.dfjw.org/workcamps ) . 
  a lot of them are accessible if you are between 16/25 years old . 
  maybe you will find something like that in austria , but reading the french description , it seems like open to all kind of nationalities . 
  we do n't know in fact . 
  they never speak about their religion . 
  when parisian says `` provincial '' or `` province '' . 
  i ca n't explain why , but in my head , it sound really arrogant and i immediatly consider them as assholes . 
  and since they use those words near everyday ... 
   ** salt butter ** or nothing . 
  ftfy . 
  seems like the japaneses do n't use butter as well in their sandwiches . 
  [ here ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c6h3mtsvaaakch2.jpg ) is a japanese ham-butter . 
  except brittany which want nantes and the mont-saint-michel back ... 
  yeah , you guys should really improve your english , it 's incomprehensible . 
  our bad level in english and the fact we complain about everything . 
  i have a friend whose parents are first cousins . 
  she has two brothers and they are all just fine , she study medecine , while her brothers prefer law and economics . 
  i know it was harsh for her when she was in middle school , since the other childrens mocked her because of her parents . 
  that 's maybe why nowoday , i 'm more openmind concerning this kind of relationship than the rest of the french population ... 
  if they love each other , i do n't get the point of forbiden their relationship .

  yes , there is immediatly a kind of complicity between us . 
  like if we excepted them to tease us . 
  for example , if the unoriginal surrender jokes were made by the english and not by the americans , it will pass better for me . 
  uk is our arch rival , it 's `` logical '' to tease each other about wars ( you , monsters burned jeanne d'arc ! ), 
  while usa always had been our ally and never experimented a ww on their own soil . 
  i will cheat a little bit , but my last history classes where two years ago during my law studies . 
  those lessons were about the history of penal law in france ( so the end of the class should be about napoleon . 
  we also spend long time speaking about the ma ) and roman law .
