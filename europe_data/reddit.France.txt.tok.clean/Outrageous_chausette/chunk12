  never heard this one irl . 
  in fact , i met only 3 americans , so that 's may be the reason . 
  [ what a coincidence , i just posted one of those in / r/europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xsl94/the_oldest_freestanding_building_in_the_world/ )  the cairn of barnenez is a neolithic monument located near plouezoc ' h in northern finist\u00e8re , brittany ( france ) . 
  it dates to the early neolithic , about 4800 bc ; it is considered one of the earliest megalithic monuments in europe , as well as one of the oldest man-made structures in the world , along with the tumulus of bougon and locmariaquer megaliths , also located in great west france . 
  it is also remarkable for the presence of megalithic art . 
   today , the barnenez cairn is 72 m long , up to 25 m wide and over 8 m high . 
  it is built of 13,000 to 14,000 tons of stone . 
  it contains 11 chambers entered by separate passages . 
  then , we may find the [ carnac stones ] ( http://www.carnac-hotel.com/usermedia/photo-635729931513810947-1.jpg?dummy=0&amp;h=800 ) from 4500 bc . 
  they are part of our folklore ( the stones are roman legions which had been enchanted by merlin our savior ) but we all know it 's obelix work . 
  near the carnac stones , we may find the tumulus of saint michel . 
  picture 1 ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/tumulus_saint-michel_ ( 2 ) . jpg/1200px-tumulus _ saint-michel _ ( 2 ) . jpg ) , [ picture 2 ] ( http://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/1/30/44/34/20150522/ob_62f1f9_tumulus-coupe.jpg )  the saint-michel tumulus consists of a mound of earth and stones 125 meters long , 50 meters wide and 10 meters high . 
  according to wikipedia ( i know ) , it 's the [ 3rd oldest building ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_buildings#by_age ) in the world . 
  when i said that to my dad , he just answered `` i ate on this tumulus every monday for 1 year . '',

  then , one of the best paleolithic place in france is obvisouly the [ grotte de lascaux ] ( http://leseyzies-tourist.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/lascaux-cave.jpg ) ( 17000bp ) . 
  there is a perfect replica you can visit , i recommand it , it 's really cool !, 
  in fact , if you love this period , you have to go in dordogne region . 
  there are so much interesting archaeologic places and a lot of medieval castels .

  oh , yes , it 's from morroco . 
  i read '' other countries '' . 
  my bad . 
  i like when they correct me . 
  but if i wrote a huge paragraph with a lot of argumentation , spend a lot of time to contribute to the debate , and just get a correction without a true answer concerning the content of my message , it will piss me off .

  not very `` exotic '' , i know . 
  for the little story , the famous striped shirt ( or marini\u00e8re ) and the garlic necklace stereotypes came from the [ `` onion johnny '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onion_johnny ) who were breton farmers and agricultural labourers on bicycles who sell onions door to door in great britain . 
  it 's surprising french people get this stereotypes as well , since most of them only spoke breton . 
  in the wikipedia page , it is even said : * '' they ( at least those born before world war ii ) could not really speak french well or only with difficulty ( breton being a celtic language related to cornish and welsh ) , so that in wales they often used breton to converse with welsh speakers . 
  [ which is a town twin of y , in france and ee in neetherland ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3lo07i/til_that_the_welsh_town/ ) . 
  yeah , i guess people from brittany know a little bit more about wales and cornwalls than the rest of french popuation . 
  we had a very similar language , share the same anthem tune and share the same folklore ( like arthur legends , the ankou , korrigans etc ) . 
  [ looks like it 's the same in france .

  no parisians ? 
  oh , it 's * him * . 
  god , i hated this song . 
  it 's the kind of song wich stay stuck in your head for the whole day . 
  horrible . 
  well , personnaly , i dislike gansta rap mostly because it 's often vulgar , stereotypical or auto-tun\u00e9 . 
  but i agree that the tune is often better than the conscious rap one . 
  plus , the wwi destroyed big parts of the industry in this [ area ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/34/5d/db/345ddb83b75d37edf0132463a28c35c8.jpg ) . 
  it never fully recovered . 
  i understand , we all have `` phases '' . 
  i do n't really listen conscious rap anymore . 
  the last two years , i mostly listened trip-hop ( chinese man , al ` tarba , boogie belgium etc. . . ) , electro-swing ( caravan palace , parov stellar etc. . . ) and epic music . 
  [ here is our chart for february . 
  ] ( http://www.chartsinfrance.net/charts/singles.php ) i 'm surprised by the second song though . 
  never heard this one . 
  well , there are 1 million bretons in paris , so it repreasant 10 % of paris population . 
  in comparison , brittany has only 3,3 million of inhabitants . 
  and i did n't even count the number of breton descendants . 
  it 's because between 1850/1920 , we were as `` traveller '' as the irish , mostly because brittany was poor as fuck . 
  here is a funny [ example ] ( http://www.hel-looks.com/20120815_02/ ) of a guy searching `` his roots '' . 
  we never wore kilt in brittany . 
  but let 's be honest , i 've never seen someone that extrem irl . 
  he 's just a weirdo . 
  a lot of parisian come here mostly to see the countryside ( some typic farms . 
  yeah . ), 
  and visit distant family . 
  well , he likes gansta rap . 
  if you like conscious rap ( which i prefear ) , there are [ mc solaar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkz8ufnoiwq ) , [ manau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkpdk3jxlay ) , [ iam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inud2d7r8bk ) , [ kari james ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzfcr3fpu4 ) , [ orelsan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2kvtrprvkk ) , [ ntm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4uom7s38xa ) ( well , this one is not one of their conscious one , but i like it ) , [ bigflo et oli ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btbzrysctcq ) , [ stupeflip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdaahmztnve ) ( one of the weirdest one . 
  i like it though ) etc. . . 
  they are less stereotypical , but i guess it 's less attractive if you do n't understand the lyrics . 
  quite common in the south of brittany . 
  it 's mostly dutch people with their caravan and old british people who like `` the weither '' ( = not too hot ) and the bracing air . 
  but the large majority of our tourists are parisians who come back seing their family and trying to find their `` roots '' . 
  l\u2019am\u00e9rique represent the whole continent , while an `` am\u00e9ricain '' is just an american citizen . 
  i think it 's the same for the largue majority of french people .
