  bravo ) . 
  no , i said , as churchill said himself , that comparing hitler and napoleon is plain stupid and disrepectfull for napoleon . 
  they did n't share the same values , they had n't the same goal , and they had completly different personalities . 
  yes , they were succussful commender ( and for hitler , it 's more questionable ) but that 's all . 
  it 's as pertinent as comparing hitler to ceasar . 
  as the first historian said , this kind of comparison is full of anachronism . 
  and finaly , as you said yourself , you '' * do n't know shit about this period * '' . 
  all your argumentation proved your lack of knowledge about the context during this period . 
  you should really read some books about it , it 's really an interesting period . 
  personnaly , i read all the collection `` histoire de france '' when i was a children . 
  here is the book about [ napoelon ] ( http://www.bedetheque.com/bd-histoire-de-france-en-bandes-dessinees-tome-17-napoleon-17137.html ) . 
  if you like french history , i recomand as well `` les rois maudits '' by maurice druan . 
  it 's about the templar curse , just before the 100 years old war . 
  it 's a really good saga . 
  you find one historian who compared him to hitler , i can find 10 who will say it 's completly bullshit . 
  look , i can do the same !, 
  '' * thierry lentz , in a paper originally presented at the 2011 consortium on the revolutionary era , 1750-1850 , takes a look at a particular branch of historiography that grew out of the comparative biography trend of the 1980s : the anachronistic comparison of napoleon bonaparte and adolf hitler * '' as i said before , he mostly fought defensive wars . 
  i do n't understand what 's your point with his desire of conquest . 
  it 's really stereotypal , the same way that no , hitler did n't wanted to conquer the world . 
  come on . 
  do n't fall in the english propaganda . 
   a guy make himself an emperor ( ! ), 
  in a country on fire like france was at that time yes , and the rest of europe was under absolute monarchy . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  france was under a civil war , they needed a strong chief , not a bunch of elites completly disconnected of the reality who were fighting each others . 
  napoleon took the place without even a fight . 
   attempts to defeat britain with a continental blockade well , of course , they were creating coalitions to destroy the revolutionar war . 
   resistance to the regime : in spain for napoleon but not in belgium , in germany , in italy , in poland etc. . . 
  so what ? 
   the story comes to an end with their respective countries in ruins . 
  do n't know about that . 
  he changed our civil law , our administration , our military etc. 
  we continue to use a lot of his laws/institutions , at the contrary of germany with hitler . 
   the far-right french rethoric of the peaceful napoleon saving france from its predator is pure bullshit and the left french rethoric of the warmonger napoleon trying to conquer europe is pure bullshit and a pure anglo saxon propaganda . 
  the only point i may conseived is the slavery , but it seems like it 's not important enought for you . 
   also , because you mention it , some thinks napoleon 's policies about jewish people was n't that benevolent did he exterminate them ? 
  he had been authoritar about how they should handle their religion , but it 's benefic for them at the long run . 
  you know , jewish people had always been rejected by the rest of the population and where living in gettos . 
  it look like a lot our current secularism , no ? 
  russia and austria where very irritated by those laws , because they were mostly antisemistics . 
  and you know what ? 
  those countries were n't diriged by a emperor !, 
   there are analogies , hitler admired napoleon like a lot of other people . 
  so what ? 
  [ even churchill admired him ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/winston-churchill/11376367/who-were-winston-churchills-biggest-heroes.html ) . 
  i do n't understand what 's your point . 
  funnily ,  most of all , chuchill hated it when people would compare hitler to napoleon . 
  '' * it seems an insult to the great emperor and warrior , * '' he said , '' * to connect him in any way with a squalid caucus boss and butcher . '' *, 
  i know , i 'm from here as well ( i think there are a lot of breton in this sub ) . 
  but kouign amann is pretty hard to cook , i recomand rather some basic cr\u00eapes , but with salt butter caramel inside it  i think it 's pretty difficult to find a national dish for france , since all our regions have a famous different dish ... 
  i really like this song , even though i think that at the end , it 's a little bit too much repetitive . 
  we have a lot of beautiful military songs though , i also like the [ strasbourgeoise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlogkjhigoq ) song and the famous [ `` vous n'aurez pas l'alsace et la lorraine '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3a4kol4yo ) for example ( on aimais vraiment pas les allemands , hein ? ) . 
  also , maybe it 's because i 'm from here , but i really like the [ breton anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y_m4nl3biw ) as well ( ouais , ch ` suis chauvin ) . 
  do n't know the other regional anthems though ... 
  and you are wrong . 
  it was mostly defensive wars , he did n't even began the first coalition . 
  the only offensive wars he made was against portugal and spain ( he had been a douchbag with spain ) and attacked russia because russian troops were too close of poland borders ( and he sweared he will protect poland ) * [ the first coalition  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_first_coalition#early_setbacks_for_france ) the french republic attacked first because austria wanted to put another king on the french crown . 
  * [ seconde coalition : britain + austria + russia + ottoman empire + portugal + naples attacked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_second_coalition#the_war ) . 
  the war began because of uk and austria who wanted to avoid the spread of the revolutionar ideas across europe . 
  * [ third coalition  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_third_coalition#from_amiens_to_the_third_coalition ) the british created another coalition --   * the nascent third coalition came into being in december 1804 when , in exchange for payment , an anglo-swedish agreement was signed allowing the british to use swedish pomerania as a military base against france . 
  british prime minister william pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against france . 
  * so french agression because of the creation of this alliance . 
  * [ the 4th coalition  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_fourth_coalition ) :  * the fourth coalition ( 1806 -- 1807 ) of prussia , russia , saxony , sweden and britain formed against france within months of the collapse of the previous coalition . 
  influenced by his wife queen louise and the war party in berlin , in august 1806 the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iii made the decision to go to war independently of any other great power . 
  * so prussian initiative . 
  * [ the 5th coalition  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_fifth_coalition#austria_strikes_first ) : by austria * french invasion of russia : napoleon initiative * it led as consequence the creation of the 6th coalition . 
  you should really open a history book , dude . 
  this guy was really liked by the [ jewish community ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/napol%c3%a9on_et_les_juifs ) because he was the first to consider them `` french before all '' . 
  he also helped with the independance of poland ( and is even mentionned in their anthem ) , helped indirecaly with the unification of [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation_of_the_rhine ) and [ italy ] ( http://img11.deviantart.net/3f49/i/2011/080/e/a/napoleonic_italy_by_hillfighter-d3c63t4.png ) , which were mostly composed by independant cities states . 
  he also indirecaly helped with the creation of [ belgium ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a9volution_belge#contexte ) and the independance of some [ latino countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_american_wars_of_independence ) . 
  [ he also spread the civil law across europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/map_of_the_legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png/1280px-map_of_the_legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png ) , made the [ metric system mandatory in france the ( 4 november 1800 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/syst%c3%a8me_international_d'unit%c3%a9s#la_r.c3.a9volution_fran.c3.a7aise_et_la_naissance_du_syst.c3.a8me_m.c3.a9trique ) , [ spreaded the abolisation of the death sentence for homosexuality across europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4yu50c/decriminalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe/ ) , created the baccalaureat , the conseil d'etat , the prefecture , the french territory division , the civil code , the procedure civil code , the commerical code , the penal code , the cour de cassation , the prud ` homme , . the banque de france , the cours des comptes , the [ lyc\u00e9es ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyc%c3%a9e_en_france#histoire ) , the l\u00e9gion d'honneur etc. . . 
  yes , he was controvercial , mostly because of the slavery ( which had been abolish during the french revolution , but not setting up ) , but come on , do n't compare [ this dude ] ( http://www.lavie.fr/images/2015/06/03/63809_diaporama01.jpg ) to hitler . 
  yeah , he also never wanted the franco-prussian war , but had been `` forced '' by the public opinion ( we hated the germans ) . 
  he also decided to create the haussman apartments in paris , because of the insulibrity and the traffic jams in the town . 
  he also created the first social housing to help the poor population who saw their house destroyed by the constructions . 
  [ he also modernized the agriculture and helped for workers rights . ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/situation_sociale_sous_le_second_empire ) . 
  [ he also helped a lot for the unification of italy by beating some autrian asses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon_iii#war_in_italy_.e2.80.93_magenta_and_solferino_.281859.29 ) . 
  because of this war , italy gave us the region near nice . 
  relevant : http://i.imgur.com/8i3hqai.png in fact , he was one of the most socialist king we ever had , pretty much like louis xvi , who was pretty liked by the population ( before his treason ) . 
  but sadly , they were perceived as being weak . 
  what ? 
  the large majority of our history teachers loves him . 
  and comparing him to hitler is really ridiculous . 
  [ it 's from coluche , a famous french humorist though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gph2si29afw#t=2m55 ) . 
  [ boeuf bourguignon ] ( http://static.cuisineaz.com/400x320/i94631-boeuf-bourguignon.jpg ) and for the dessert ... [ profiteroles au chocolat ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/medias.producteursdelait.fabrique3.net/beurre/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/profiteroles_au_chocolat_famille_du_lait-1024x768.jpg ) , maybe ? 
  hum ... 
  i know plently of americans who think that . 
  you know , the common surrender stereotype : `` your only great commander , napoleon , was italian '' . 
  and was the emperor of france for much more longer . 
  i do n't really get it , he was corsican , right , but not italian . 
  italian nation did n't even existed back this time and even though corsica was under g\u00eana rules before his birth , his father fought for the independance of corsica . 
  he was himself in favor of its independance when he was teenager . 
  he is corsican and french by his birth , his actions and convictions . 
  not italian . 
  weird when you know that napoleon died saying `` france , army , head of the army , jos\u00e9phine . '', 
  yes , but de lesquen is more racist and anti feminist than trump . 
   italian triggered, 
  yeah , in brittany , we never say `` l'am\u00e9rique '' . 
  mostly `` aux \u00c9tats-unis '' , `` aux usa '' or `` aux states '' ( for edgy teenagers ) . 
  i find [ trudeau ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/eb/c2/80/ebc280f3a329fff7dcb2c5ea6723fce2.jpg ) really handsome .
