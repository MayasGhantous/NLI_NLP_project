  because we are  but honestly , their accent was n't that exagerated . 
  welsh and breton are very close cultures . 
  we share the same [ anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qvobbhx4j8 ) , our [ language ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/langues_brittoniques#tableau_lexical_comparatif ) is so close , a welsh and a breton may understand each other , we share a similar [ folklore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ankou ) etc. . . 
  in fact , the stereotypes of the french people wearing striped shirt and carrying onions come from the [ onion johny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onion_johnny ) , who were breton merchants . 
  french people still associate striped t-shirt ( or * marini\u00e8re * ) [ with brittany ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=style+breton&amp;safe=active&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=549&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewimxyhvx5nsahxlorokhqtpbtaq_auibigb ) as well . 
  no , but we should have more handball on tv . 
  the same should be apply to basketball , rugby etc. 
  we already hear about football everyday , it should be a bit more diverse . 
  god , it 's horrible ... and what happend to your sport teacher ? 
  i hope he had been arrested . 
  while france national handball team is world champion for the 6th time , we continue to focus on football ... 
  it 's sad . 
  the last one is `` la gamelle '' . 
  i also liked the games : ** dauphin dauphine ** : the youngest children has the ball . 
  he has to throw the ball in the air ( vertically ) while screaming the name of one of the other players . 
  all the players run away the most fast possible from the ball . 
  if the guy who had been called manadge to catch the ball before it fell on the ground , he has to trow the ball while screaming another name . 
  if the ball touch the ground , when he get back the ball , he must scream `` stop '' . 
  all the player ( who runned away ) freeze . 
  then , the player with the ball got 3 step to come closer to one of his victim . 
  he win if he manadge to touch his victim . 
  this one may avoid the ball , but he ca n't move his feets . 
  ** la tomate ** : something like that --  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl2fh-ioqz0 the players form a round . 
  we have to spread our legs so they touch the feet of our neigbours . 
  the goal is to pass the ball between the legs of someone else to eleminate him . 
  you 've got several chances : * if the ball pass one time between your legs , you have to play with one of your hand behind your back . 
  * if the ball pass two times , you have to turn over ( so you show your beautifull bottom to the other players ) . 
  you 've got your two hands . 
  * if the ball pass three times , you stay in the same position , but with one hand behind your back . 
  * if the ball pass for the 4th time , it 's finish . 
  ** le facteur n'est pas pass\u00e9 ** : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6djfywj_i9y ( looks like it 's in a british school ) all the players form a round . 
  we all sit down . 
  then , a player is designated to play the `` facteur '' ( postman ) . 
  he got a random small object with him . 
  all the players have to close their eyes and to sing the counting rythme '' * the postman did n't passed . 
  he will pass this week : monday , tuesday , wednesday , thursday , friday , saturday , sunday ... * '' during the song , the postman hided the object just behind one of the players . 
  when the players open their eyes , they all check behind them . 
  the one who had been selected then enter in a high-speed pursuit and try to touch the postman . 
  the postman have to sit down at the place of the guy who had been selected . 
  if he losed , he has to go in the middle of the circle , la soupe ( the soup ) and wait until another one get caught . 
  otherwise , he become a random player . 
  the one who had been selected become the postman . 
  [ the ch ` ti accent !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5thinsyyy4 ), 
  i had erasmus friends from flanders in my university . 
  they all spoke fluently french but with the [ typical wallonian accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-ib9dv7w4 ) !, 
  it was so weird , they perfectly fit the stereotype we have about wallonian , even more than the wallonian themselves ( wallonian do n't have a strong accent anymore ) . 
  funnily , here our politicians consider the bukini as a symbol of salafist ... 
  ] ( http://lesavaistu.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/capture-d%e2%80%99%c3%a9cran-2015-10-14-%c3%a0-15.59.44.png ), 
  seems like i was wrong for the engineer part . 
  i know someone from polytechnique who said me he paid near 1000 $ per month so i thought it was the same for other schools . 
  looks like it 's mostly 1000/2000 $ per year for other schools . 
  here , colleges ( law , medecine , history , language , science , economics etc ) are free for families who do n't earn a lot of money . 
  for me , it was 300 $ per year until my master , which cost 500 $ . 
  for business or ingeneer school , it will cost near 10 000 $ per year . 
  yes , if he is from saudi-arabia or from another very religious muslim country , i will definitivly avoid him . 
  i do n't want to become one of those ... womens , i want to be well treated . 
  plus , i often heard about the `` kidnapping '' of the childrens by the ex-husband ... nah , it 's too risky . 
  if he is n't religious and share the sames values than me , i will give him a try though . 
  in france . 
  you will not get ban for having a right-wing mentality , you 're over reacting . 
  for example , chepamec , a very active moderator of / r/le _ pen is a pretty recurent member of / r/france community , and get upvotes in some subjects . 
  he is just civilized and gives his arguments without insulting the other members . 
  that 's enought to get upvotes , even by pro-melenchonist . 
  uk , they drive on the wrong side !, 
  so , i will recomand you my favorit saga , * the accursed kings * . 
  just keep in mind it 's a fiction , so this saga is not entirely true , but all the major events in this book really happend irl : * [ maurice druon : the accursed kings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_accursed_kings ) ( 7 books of 200 pages . ), 
  it 's really easy , quick to read , and pretty captivating . 
  the plot is set during the reigns of the last five kings of the capetian dynasty and the first two kings of the house of valois in 1313 . 
  the series begins as the french king philip the fair , already surrounded by scandal and intrigue , brings `` a curse '' upon his family when he persecutes the knights templar ( the curse obvioulsy does n't exist , but it was a belief of this time , since philp really destroyed the [ order of solomon 's temple ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knights_templar#arrests.2c_charges_and_dissolution ) and the curse is a [ actual legend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacques_de_molay#curse ) from this epoque ) . 
  the succession of monarchs that follows leads france and england to the hundred years ' war . 
  for some anedoctes , this book saga was really appreciated by putin ( yeah ... ) and george r.r. 
  martin . 
  according to george r. r. martin , : * the accursed kings has it all . 
  iron kings and strangled queens , battles and betrayals , lies and lust , deception , family rivalries , the curse of the templars , babies switched at birth , she-wolves , sin , and swords , the doom of a great dynasty ... and all of it ( well , most of it ) straight from the pages of history . 
  and believe me , the starks and the lannisters have nothing on the capets and plantagenets . 
  this is the original game of thrones * ** edit : sorry , did n't read all your description . 
  i recommand then history of france , by jacques bainville : https://www.amazon.com/history-france-jacques-bainville/dp/b0006d8f0s**, 
  it will be mostly stereotypes but well : * [ france ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua2loighz38#t=1m8 ) * [ italy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1av9x2d-f5g ) ( i really love this one ) * [ spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qew9cyr3t0g ) * [ germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1koat1vdlmc ) ( experimental electro music ) * [ netherland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c7ugr_siw0 ) * [ england - london ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqjensnunpm ) * [ scottish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8aev8jbx6m ) ( sorry ... ) * [ wales ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrkgdj0bvao ) * [ irish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fngvqs_pmq ), 
  i really like this [ welsh song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrkgdj0bvao ) and this one from [ brittany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkzquxqh-y4 ) ... do n't know why though . 
  it makes me nostalgic ... 
  the burkini ban concerned 30 towns because of mayors who wanted to please their right-wing electorate . 
  there is a total 17 300 towns in france . 
  the burkini ban had been canceled 1 month later by the `` conseil d'etat '' . 
  there is no debate here . 
  it 's done . 
  i heard the same story , even though i 'm pretty sure it 's mostly because we came after the generation x. 
  absolutly love it , but it was n't one of my childhood cartoons . 
  i 'm too old for that . 
  :( edit : and avatar . 
  those two cartoons are my favorits while i 'm adult ( plus a lot of animes ), 
  i also heard g\u00e9n\u00e9ration y on the media . 
  never irl though . 
  haha , but for us , it 's not complicated . 
  we do n't think about it . 
  i remember , at first , i shocked some english guys while i was in london , because it 's something so naturel for me i automatically approched them for the bise during the introductions . 
  one time , one of them did n't understand and finaly huged me awkwardly ^ ^ ' we do that near every day since we are child , it 's just as `` natural '' than a simple nod for you , especially when you 're a woman ( my case ) . 
  i watched it , but i was n't a fan of this show . 
  in general , if we know you 're not french , it 's pretty ok to refuse la bise . 
  for me , when i 'm really tired/lazy , i just pretend being sick .
