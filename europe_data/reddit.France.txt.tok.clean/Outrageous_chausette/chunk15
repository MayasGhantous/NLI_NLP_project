  in this video , there was only 10 people . 
  but sometimes , for familial parties or a weading for example , you have to do the bise to all the invites !, 
  it 's so tiring . 
  i remember having the same `` shock culture '' you had , but in usa , when people tried to hug me . 
  i find it 's even more intrusive than the bise , i always made a recoil . 
  paul taylor , an english youtuber , is pretty popular in france . 
  his video concept is to criticize french culture , and it 's pretty funny to watch , and for you , easy to understand . 
  the first video he made was about [ la bise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-vwbv6tjxu ) . 
  then , here is a [ playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol3ewowq_c&amp;index=2&amp;list=pl6otexnyf-bwg-xntrgbvkoqllw7jkegj ) of his more recent videos . 
  take paris instead . 
  we do n't want anything in exchange , it 's a gift . 
  a wonderful gift . 
  you will love it . 
  it 's true . 
  [ m\u00e9lenchon has his own youtube channel . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plnam9o_xn_3czszhvkm6dg2adkfyp8qz_ ) he is from the far left wing and should have near 10 % of the votes for the first round . 
  the mysterious cities of gold were popular in uk ? 
  everybody know them in france , even though a lot of children never watched an episode ( btw , it 's just a ugly 3d version nowodays ) . 
  it 's mostly famous for the [ opening ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7ncymfrojm#t=0m38s ) . 
  * [ martin mystery ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so_371lehlo ) * [ totally spies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtg_ldlrfo ) * [ p\u00e8re castor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwduojwhjvo ) * [ the pirate familly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac1vl6laf6y ) * [ code lyoko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwed4vjb7no ) edit : i forgot [ tintin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ek_tfz9ug ) the sunday . 
  you know , some people who voted fillon/lepen were also for the same sex-mariage . 
  in fact , strangly , a lot of gay will vote lepen . 
  the same way , i know pro-lepen people who are still pro-europe . they say that if she pass , she will ask a referendum for the frexit . 
  they just have to say no . 
  believe it or not , but lepen program is pretty extrem-left in term of economy . 
  she want protectionism , she want to increase the minimal wage , to come back to a retreat at 60 years old and is against globalism . 
  you are not a leftist then , your idea seems to fits lepen 's one ( which is good for you , since you planned to vote for her ) . 
  plus , hopefully , you do n't have to agree with everything her party propose , it would be boring as fuck otherwise . 
  it 's even sane to discut some of their resolutions ( and it 's the case for all kind of party ), 
  yes , of course . 
  the saint barthelemy was the first massacer which came in my mind , since the circonstances were `` pretty close '' to the shoah ( aka non acceptance of a certain religion ) . 
  but , yeah , during the revolution , there had been a `` genocide '' as well against the noblesse , and in pretty barbaric way . 
  the saint bartelemy was a massacer which lasted several days , but was more a passionated massacer , while the execution of the nobles continued several years , with brief and cold execution by guillotine only because they were nobles . 
  we can also mention the massacer of the vend\u00e9ens . 
  poor guys . 
  from what i just read , you 're clearly not a leftist . 
  yep . 
  england , which was a part of the norman duchy located in france . 
  because of the plantagn\u00eat family , they had some statements for the french throne as well . 
  the hundred years war began because of those claims . 
  and i guess you already know how were our political relationships with uk since this war . 
  yes . 
  that 's why a fillon vs lepen kinda scare me . 
  i though everythink will be alright since the battle sarkozy vs lepen had been avoid , but now , after learning fillon was just another corrupt politician , i 'm sure if he pass the second round , there will be a huge abstension by the left wing and the center right voters ... and lepen win . 
  seems like a lot of funny quotes are from cl\u00e9menceau . 
  the [ st. bartholomew 's day massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._bartholomew%27s_day_massacre ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtsfpbbneco ), 
  and you are from ... ? 
  yes , it 's really good when they are [ `` saut\u00e9s '' ] ( http://scally.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c676f53ef01b7c82dba6c970b-pi ) . 
  you cook your potatoes in a saucepan full of boiling water . 
  you put butter in the bottom of a frying pan . 
  when the butter is melting , you add your unpeeled little potatoes which had been cut in several little bits . 
  you fry the potateos , add some provencal herb . 
  then , you add some lardons and voila !, 
  it 's easy to cook and delicious , 
  yes , for the [ olympic games ] ( http://www.asterix.com/bd/albs/12fr.jpg ) . 
  hmm ... 
  i 'm a little more skeptical . 
  if you mumbled `` death to america '' , i think they will ignore you ( some will not even understand you , we are not the best in english ) . 
  but if you said `` death to france '' , there would have higher chances you would finish in a police station . 
  we are a little more `` paranoid '' considering the terrorist attacks from last year . 
  [ super dupont !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/superdupont.jpg ) more seriously , we do n't really have supereroes here . 
  maybe asterix and obelix , who have magic potion , but except that ... edit : i found this link : https://europeisnotdead.com/video/images-of-europe/european-superheroes/, 
  well , it was during napoleon 's area and surcouff worked for him . 
  i heard this quote had been appropriated by a lot of other historical figures ( not only french one ) , but it seems like surcouff was the [ original one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_surcouf#cruise_of_revenant ) . 
   when a british captive officer challenged surcouf with the words `` you french fight for money while we fight for honour '' , surcouf replied `` each of us fights for what he lacks most '' . 
  [ 61 ] [ 62 ] i know it 's wikipedia , but there are some sources link at the end of the sentence . 
  how could you forgot charles v ? 
  '' * i speak spanish to god , italian to women , french to men , and german to my horse * '' . 
  [ felix faure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a9lix_faure ) , a french president from 1895 until 1899 , died by a heart attack while in office . 
  it has been widely reported that felix faure had his fatal seizure while his mistress was fellating him . 
  several days later , [ georges clemenceau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georges_clemenceau ) , futur french prime minister who disliked felix faure , said '' * il voulait \u00eatre c\u00e9sar , il ne fut que pomp\u00e9e * '' it 's a wordplay in french which could mean both '' * he wished to be caesar , but ended up as pompey * '' , and '' * he wished to be caesar and ended up being blown * '' the verb `` pomper '' in french is also slang for performing oral sex on a man . 
  he also had some other famous quotes as : '' * england is a former french colony which did n't turn well * '' and '' * english ? 
  it 's just french badly pronounced * '' . 
  did i mention he did n't like the british ? 
  i also found two other quotes i find pretty funny by historical french figures , but they are not politicians : 1 ) [ robert surcouf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_surcouf ) , a famous french corsair , talking with a british officer after capturing his ship , the kent : british officer : `` * you french fight for money , while we british fight for honor . 
  * '' robert surcouf : `` * sir , a man fights for what he lacks the most * '' . 
  2 ) thomas de mahy , marquis de favras , just after reading his death sentence during the french revolution : `` * sir , you have made three spelling mistakes . 
  * '' edit : spelling mistakes . 
  green eyes ? 
  not that much popular i think ... 
  it 's a beautiful color , like blue eyes for example , but it 's not a beauty standard here . 
  i find those `` studies '' very caricatural and often wide of the mark . 
  for example , i 'm pretty sure that currently , the norm is not [ face tatoo ] ( http://www.totalbeauty.com/content/slideshows/global-beauty-standards-141201/page6 ) in nz . 
  come on . 
  i remember this crappy video where they were affirming [ hairy armpit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij8kkjyqt4o#t=4m27s ) were a trend in france . 
  it 's so cringy . 
  i 'm a french woman , i 've never seen one woman with hairy armpits in my life . 
  how can they be so wrong ? 
  that 's why i never trust those videos . 
  if they are wrong with the french one , i just ca n't imagine the among of bullshit they say for other less known countries . 
  the natural look is pretty true though , even if girls with red lipstick is pretty trendy as well . 
  other than that , a girl pretty skinny and with a good fashion style seems to be the norm , even though it 's the same than in most of other countries . 
  i heard in the east of france , they said the same thing . 
  it depend of the localisation i guess . 
  oh , cool rule !, 
  same rule in france , 
  really ? 
  we just repeated chips until one of us won .
