  but `` patate , chaussette '' sound funnier . 
  we say `` chips ! '', 
  here . 
  but it 's mostly for childrens  edit : if i remember correctly , it seems like there was a game with that . 
  the other had to say `` contrechips '' to conter the `` curse '' ( like in the game uno ) . 
  if he did n't do that in the right timing , he will be punish . 
  he will not be allow to speak until the person who said `` chips '' mention his name . 
  well , do n't know if this trend still exist nowodays . 
   we kicked german asses in verdun great , vive la france , we made great sacrifices otherwise we would all be speaking feldgrauen 's language instead of glorious fran\u00e7ais i think it 's more an american speech than an european one . 
  only americans do n't understand we will not sudently change our language to please the winner of the war . 
  changing a language will happen only if the conqueror maintain his `` empire '' at least 200 years , and even here , it will be moslty an influence over the original language ( like roman empire over spanish language or the norman invasion and the plantagen\u00eat family ) . 
  that 's really cringy to heard this kind of argument , showing , another time , the lack of knowledge the americans have for european wars . 
  1 ) i spoke about the muslim population ( even though it 's more the arab one but well ) since we had `` problems '' with some of them in france , that 's all . 
  2 ) if an ** american ** has his two parents from france , go back near each year in france to see the rest of his family , speak fluently french , has the dual french-american citizenship and know a lot of french cultural references , he will be consider as french by the rest of the popuation . 
  not a random guy who claim he is french because his great great great grantmother was from france . 
  3 ) i was more speaking about the first generation who grew up in france but with the culture of their parents at home that * sometimes * feel as much french as from the country of their parents . 
  the second and a 3rd muslim generation who grew up in france are normaly completly french . 
  as always , it depend how they feel it . 
  i think / u/atlas _ at is not wrong . 
  if someone grew up in austria and speak german , he will be consider as austrian by the rest of the population ( except some racists and extreme right-wing ) . 
  though , the persons / u/theeatinggames was talking about are persons who grew up in europe but also learn their parents culture ( morrocan for example ) . 
  they are austrian but grew up with the culture of the parents as well ( they learn the language , the celebrities , support their football team , go in the morroco parents once a year to visit their grandparents etc ) . 
  they are not totally european . 
  they feel autrian as much as morrocan . 
  that 's a very personal opinion , but i even think it 's a cause of the rise religious extremism the last decade ... 
  what do you mean by test/challenge ? 
  may you give an example ? 
  where i live , children [ celebrate ] ( http://www.letelegramme.fr/ar/imgproxy.php/images/2014/04/05/ecole-saint-pierre-le-carnaval-a-fiere-allure_1865682.jpg?article=20140405-1010110492&amp;aaaammjj=20140405 ) it during the period of the [ chandeleur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/candlemas#france.2c_belgium.2c_and_swiss_romandy ) . 
  we had a '' [ monsieur hiver ] ( http://www.ouest-france.fr/sites/default/files/styles/image-640x360/public/2014/03/28/monsieur-hiver-brule-samedi-soir.jpg?itok=4zzxwyel ) '' ( mister winter ) we burned near the sport hall . 
  it was really cool , do n't know if they continue the tradition though ... 
   right everyone , / r/the _ donald has arrived . 
  if i could ask you to please use small words , try to keep your sentences simple , and do n't attempt sarcasm or wit . 
  they are n't the cleverest bunch , but we should make them feel welcomed . 
  haha , love the mod :'), 
  i have to say , i do n't care about the channel purpose . 
  this video is from `` le petit journal '' , which passed on the national tv . 
  you had a bigger culture shock with english speaking countries like the usa and malta than france ? 
  since i ca n't choose , i will put 3 of my fav : * [ chinese man - i 've got that tune ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqjensnunpm ) * [ pearl jam - do the evolution ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaogu2cqti ) * [ rammstein - mein tail ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbvwch4xx6u ) ( love the intro ) what are yours ? 
  it 's even 6 % according to the [ pool ] ( http://imgur.com/a/4uwat ) , since 2 % said they did n't want to share the information and 1 % said `` other '' ( the reptilians i guess ) . 
  we are special snowflakes , 
  well , i will speak more about r/france so maybe it 's not general . 
  in r/france sub , the majority of the redditors are engineer and computer ingeneer workers/students . 
  in france , women represent 10-20 % of the students in computer ingeneery . 
  maybe there is a link ... 
  i also have the impression it has a link with video games and the `` geek '' culture in general . 
  sadly , we do n't play that much video games contrary to men . 
  men are more incline to speak english with foreigners since they used to play with them ( that 's how a lot of them improved their english ) . 
  reddit has a pretty `` nerdy '' and `` geek '' aura , so maybe that 's why women are not that much attracted by this kind of website . 
  i have the impression women stay more on instagram , deviantart , tumblr or even ... 9gag ( i know ) . 
  and herg\u00e9 ? 
  the majority of the foreigners i met did n't know david guetta and daft punk were french . 
  and i bet a lot of french do n't know that either , especially for daft punk ( they do n't sing in french after all ), 
  that 's why i said i disagree with the `` permanent '' places . 
  but regarding the recent context , the eu was the most advantaged in this council because of the 2 sieges of france and uk and the strong alliance with the usa . 
  nowoday , with brexit and trump , it 's less true . 
  i still think uk will stay a strong ally of the eu in term of military cooperation though . 
  i would say the [ age of enlightenment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_enlightenment ) for france . 
  well , i have to say , i prefer seing france and uk as member of the council than the european union as an entity . 
  let me explain : if we continue to have 5 permanent members for the un security council ( it 's better to have a pretty small number tho operate fast . 
  i disagree with the fact they are permanent though ) , here are the two situations : * having one place with the european union as an entity . 
  this european union , composed by 28 ( 7 ) members has no political and military unity , which mean a ( big ) lack of efficiency . 
  we will have 1/5 vote . 
  * continue having france and uk as member of the un security council , the two countries who have nukes and the biggest armies of the eu . 
  we have 2/5 votes . 
  for the moment , it 's better for the eu to stay this way . 
  i do n't think so ... because of the [ club dorothe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkxq-bork9a ) , a lot of people who are in their 30 's still read some manga , or at least , are not as condescending and wide of the mark than the older generation and some politicians ( [ sego ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khhgcyix1ou#t=0m20 ) ) . 
  they are not married , that 's all . 
  plus , i will add the perception of video game and manga/comics/bd . 
  since our parents/grand-parents often listen the newspapers/news broadcast and politician ( segolene royal ) , they are often completly wide of the mark . 
  so , it 's not 25 + years old , but here are some huge april fools jokes i found : * [ 1986 , eiffel tower moves ] ( http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/eiffel_tower_moves ) * [ 1rst april 2007 , france 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzcq_tuvchs ) ( in french ) : they said on the national news broadcast that the wind turbine finally have an impact on the earth 's rotation . 
  * [ 1rst april 2008 ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5uhfs_raymond-domenech-poisson-d-avril-20_sport ) : raymond domenech , the former manager of the french national football team , said that french team will avoid the euro cup because '' we are tired '' . 
  my parents own a little forrest near our house ( it could be consider as our garden ) . 
  we already seen a fox , a peacock ( do n't know why and how ) and another day , a cute little fawn ( we even arrived to aproach him a little bit ) . 
  of course , we also have a lot of rabbits , mouses , and grass snake . 
  one day , we observed a squirel doing a weird game in our forrest . 
  we hang a two trees hamac . 
  the squirel climbed one those tree , moved on a branch and let himself fall on the hamac . 
  he started it again 3 times . 
  so sad i losed my phone , i should have put it on youtube :( another weird encounter : one day , my sisters were walking on a cycle lane in the middle of the broc\u00e9liande forest . 
  they meet a kangourou who escaped from a `` farming `` near here . 
  8 firemans went and tried to captur the kangourou . 
  they spend 30 minutes . 
  take a look by yourself . 
  for the moment , they are in a fort/castle/cattle trend , so do n't be surprise . 
  normaly , it 's pretty safe . 
  for the moment , the majority of the news concern the french elections ( the sub is in majority pro macron , and hate mlp ) . 
  i just avoid the sub when there is a huge european crisis , since i have the impression it just become a echochamber ( immigrant crisis , brexit etc. . . ) . 
  but ap ~ ~ p ~ ~ art from that , the large majority of the racist/too right wing comments are downvoted or finish in / r/shitamericanssay . 
  plus , the garantee for those bag is 30 years . 
  it was really a good sales argument . 
  well , if you visit a little bit more on this subreddit , you will see by yourself . 
  one year ago , it was pretty bad , especialy during the immigrant crisis , but nowodays , it 's a pretty left-wing sub . 
  here is a [ survey about political compass ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28qxoa/anybody_interested_in_a_political_compass_survey/ ) from 2 years ago . 
  a lot of them are one the left-libertarian part . 
  i think we use a lof the `` decathlon '' brand here in france . 
  in fact , that 's how i spot a french tourist when i 'm abroad . 
  oh , and [ eastpak ] ( http://www.citadium.com/mediaproduct/sac-a-dos-wyoming-eastpak/1082241-noir-1-260wx260h.jpg ) and [ longchamps ] ( http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctcsv0bgyq4o3gh4jwyok1m4vixmz2c8zdwt_p2rx6cv3xl3znub_fw3km ) bags are very popular here . 
  according to my little sister , all the teenagers have one of thoses . 
  i trust her , it was already the most popular brands when i was at school 8 years ago after all . 
  for the food , herta , fleury michon and president according to [ those statistics ] ( http://www.marketing-pgc.com/2016/05/23/les-50-marques-les-plus-achetees-en-france/ ) .
