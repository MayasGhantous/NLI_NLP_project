  [ left-libertarian ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/chart?ec=-4.0&amp;soc=-6.72 ) love seeing tatcher being compared to hitler and staline, 
  german : * zwei bier , bitte * and * ich mag mein flip flop * spanish : * vamos a la playa * italian : * non parlo italiano * portuguaise : * bon noche * polish : * kurwa !, 
  honestly , 9 countries , it 's a lot . 
  too much to enjoy everything in fact . 
  if i were you , i would rather choose 3/4 countries in the mediterranean area ( because of the beaches . 
  it 's summer after all  ) . 
  maybe a trip like : * france : [ saint tropez ] ( http://www.planetware.com/photos-large/f/france-saint-tropez-vieux-port.jpg ) or [ cannes ] ( http://en.ruc-hotel.com/usermedia/photo-635821921838403054-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=700&amp;crop=true ) and [ nice ] ( http://www.ahstatic.com/photos/city/vi-v2813_00_1400x442.jpg ) . 
  corsica is beautiful as well , but the trip is long and expensive and you do n't have that much time . 
  sincerely , if you stay only 2 days here , it does n't worth it . 
  you have to visit venice , it 's sooo beautiful and quite unique . 
  one big day is suffisant to visit it though . 
  also , if you have a little more time , you can try to visit the alps in the north , it 's really beautiful as well . 
  * slovenia : [ ljubliana ] ( http://www.tbs-education.fr/sites/default/files/upload/stockfile/commun/summer-school/2013/ljubljana.jpg ) seems to be really pretty and the nightlife looks pretty active . 
  but i have to say , i 've never been there so maybe someone will give you better advices than me . 
  * and finally [ croatia ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=croatia&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewidgeao-ulrahxjwxokhzwvbdwq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=549 ) , where i will spend a little more time and maybe try one of those huge [ festival ] ( https://www.festicket.com/fr/magazine/best-festivals-croatia/ ) ( [ english version ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/croatia/articles/croatia-best-summer-music-festivals/ ) ) we often heard about in europe . 
  there are a lot of other beautiful countries in the north as well , but i have to say , when i think `` summer holidays '' , the mediterranean area pop in my mind . 
  keep in mind there will be a lot of tourists in those places . 
  oh , and you can also switch one of the countries i mentionned with spain ( barcelona and ibiza are famous for their parties ) or greece ( just beautiful and full of history ) . 
  edit : sorry , the link for the festivals was in french : /, 
  the others have already answered your question about your `` european '' citizenship but i will give you another advice : do n't say `` i 'm hungarian '' to a hungarian person or even a european just because you have a great great great father who came from here . 
  it 's a common mistake from americans , but you will not be welcome as a '' * lost brother who come back home * '' . 
  you are american , and will stay american until you adopt their culture ( know their language , history , some popular reference , politics , movies , song etc ) . 
  if you want more informations about that , go read [ this tread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/54g5hb/why_do_some_europeans_seem_to_really_hate_when/ ) or even r/shitamericanssay ( sorry if it sound harsh , but as i said before , it 's a common mistake from americans ) but you seem to be quite optimist and open minded . 
  if you keep this attitude , it should be alright , 
   got it 's independence when those two could n't agree on who would annect the place remind me that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5wchba8kjy#t=0m23, 
  what ? 
  italy 's economy is the 8th biggest one in the world and the 3rd biggest one in eu in term of gdp ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxbu21v_7dm&amp;t=329s#t=1m04 enjoy !, 
  yeah , in louisiana , the little figure is only baby jesus christ ( while in france at least , it could be about everything ) and they do n't have the `` chance '' to wear a [ paper crown ] ( http://creche-de-noel.pagesperso-orange.fr/images/galette-des-rois-couronne-gp3-548291.jpg ) like in france . 
  their cake is pretty [ weird ] ( http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/2124691.jpg ) as well . 
  since i will irritate polish people if i mention chopin , i will rather say [ debussy _ clair de lune ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvfh_6dnrcy ) . 
  there is also [ camille saint-sa\u00ebns _ aquarium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvpl-rnzde4 ) ( in `` the beauty and the beast '' from disney ) or [ camille saint-sa\u00ebns _ danse macabre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyknbtm_yym#t=5m20s ) ( in mickey 's house of villains ... 
  yeah . ), 
  that i really like . 
  edit : for a modern composer , i recommend [ yann tiersen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfwwkcrth_a ) ( amelie poulain , good bye lennin etc ), 
  same goes to spain though ... 
  we have a king cake as well here , but not with the same shape and tradition than yours . 
  i also learned one week ago it 's pretty common in louisiana as well . 
  i wonder if it 's still a thing in south america ... 
  not that much . 
  it was seen as a necessity . 
  back this time , there were huge problems of hygiene since paris was overpopulated . 
  before the reorganisation and the extention , the density was of 100 000 unhabitant per km \u00b2 . 
  after , it was of 36 400 unhabitant per km \u00b2 . 
  there were so much traffic jam , it was awful ( and cars did n't even existed back then . . ) in fact , the public opinion was largely in favor of those constructions , especially the bourgeoisie , who was affraid the overpopulation will cause some ... bloody rebellions ( we loved revolutions ) since a lot of family had to move out , napoleon iii created the first council housing at the suburbs so the lpoorer population was n't that much frustrated as well . 
  no , the only big contestation i recall was the eiffel tower construction , which was seen as a ugly building that disfigured paris ( i have to say , if i had been at their position , i would have thought the same ... ) . 
  with a apple compote and pur\u00e9e , it 's delicious though , 
   the franco german brigade what a ugly coat of arms . 
  r/french is about learning french language , so some there are some french / canadian / belgian / swiss news inside it . 
  there is also r/francophonie , not very active though ... 
  [ langue de boeuf ] ( http://images.marmitoncdn.org/recipephotos/multiphoto/47/4791cff5-6fe0-4767-858a-e0f3deb4df35_normal.jpg ) ( cow tongue ) is really smooth and quite delicious . 
  children tend to like that , until they learn what it really is . 
  we also may eat [ lamp brain ] ( http://www.monpanierfute.fr/images/produit/z1296-1-zoom521.jpg ) , [ pig foot ] ( http://cookingthebooks.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f08c4bd88340105357a2e24970b-pi ) , [ guts soup ] ( http://www.foodreporter.fr/upload/original/4/f/x/j/u/337040.jpg ) , [ blood sausage ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n-jijhdfufm/ulu8di18qai/aaaaaaaaade/ibliiiqeao0/s1600/img_9618.jpg ) , [ frog legs ] ( http://thekaydays.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/frog_legs.jpg ) ( which is like a mix between chicken and fish ) , [ snails ] ( http://www.petitsplatsentreamis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/plat-descargots-au-beurre-persill%c3%a9.jpg ) ( the best is obviously the butter sauce ) ... 
  i do n't know that much punk music : / there are : * [ les ramoneurs de menhirs - menez daou ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-63emrzzm4 ) : it 's celtic punk . 
  * [ trust - antisocial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kfolshspes ) * [ b\u00e9rurier noir - vivre libre ou mourir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj-rjokl3tq ) * [ parabellum - cayenne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sthrnmqt_fw ) * [ guerilla poubelle - generation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpwo_hjdk18 ), 
  oh maybe , i have to say i 've never done that with friends ( we prefear raclette ) , but only with my family and at school when i was younger . 
  so this tradition make sens with friend , but i thought it was weird with the family ( except if we speak about the large family ) btw , happy cake day !, 
   but if you do get the baby in your piece , you have to buy the next king cake . 
  oh , we do n't do that anymore in france ( or maybe it 's just where i live . . ) but i heard spanish continues this tradition . 
  in france , our [ king 's cake look like that ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/galette_des_rois#/media/file:galette_des_rois.png ) . 
  to ensure the distribution of the cake shares , the youngest person have to place himself under the table and name the recipient of the share which is indicated by the person in charge of the service . 
  then , the new kink receive this [ beautiful crown ] ( http://www.enfant.com/assets/posts/11000/11186-galette-des-rois-que-savez-vous.jpg ) he will have to wear during the whole day ( in general , adults wear that 1 hour and that all , but the childrens will keep it ) and will have to choose his queen/her king . 
  oh , and when we buy the galette at the backery , the feve is already inside the cake . 
  i will take # 24 your cake looks so weird in comparison to the french one , i 'm really curious . 
  but i heard there is a law in the usa which say it 's illegal to put a object inside a food preparation ( like for kinder surprise ) . 
  do you still have a `` f\u00e8ve '' ? 
  we have f\u00e8ves [ about everything here ] ( http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2015/46/1447506609-v1-star-wars-les-bustes.jpg ) , is it similar in louisiana ? 
  personnaly , i wear my shoes inside . 
  at the end of the day , i do n't wear them anymore though , but only because it 's more comfy . 
  what do you define as a `` black community '' ? 
  we do n't have a `` black '' community here , we have a martinican community , a malian community , a ivoirian community , a malgache but not a `` black '' community . 
  they do n't have the same culture , they act differently and have different accents . 
  this is a [ congolese ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulk2e_qxyac&amp; ) accent . 
  this is a [ martinican ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=virkus24-eq#t=1m02s ) one . 
  plus , do they live completly apart from the rest of the population ? 
  do they refuse to see their woman/men marying a american outside of their `` black '' community ? 
  ( some of them had been killed for that , it 's a act of treason ) do they refuse to put their childrens at school ? 
  do they refuse foreigners in their area by bracking guns ? 
  ( well , in usa , i guess yes ) do they refuse to pay their taxes ? 
  do they refuse to work ? 
  i think that the closest comparison you may have in term of racism toward the black community in the usa will be the `` arabic '' communities in europe . 
  there are in large majority intragrated to the rest of the population , even though they keep their own culture with them . 
  they pay their taxes , put their childrens in the public school , and there are a lot of `` inter-racial '' mariages with them . 
  plus , we heard way more racism and hate toward the `` arabs '' than the gypsy . 
  as i said before , they are not particulary agressive toward the rest of the population . 
  they do n't commit that much crimes/rapes/lethal attack , they just steal a lot . 
  the agessivity is more toward the other members of their comunity , so in general , we tolerate them , even though we stay suspicious toward them . 
  they stay in our town 3 month , and they disapear . 
  we are suspicious mostly because we do n't know them . 
  i know , but as you say , the circonstances are not the same . 
  the thing i try to explain you is that we do n't reject them because they are a minority or because of their skin color ( a lot of black/arab/asian minorities are considered as french for example , and full citizen of our country ) like it 's the case in the usa . 
  they have the exact same color than the french from the south , it will be really stupid . 
  so no , it 's not racism . 
  it 's ... not xenophobie either , since they are not from a different country and actually speak our language . 
  i do n't know how to explain , but it 's really because they are in a sectarian community and in fact , we just do n't know them . 
  they are here , they are not particulary violent toward the rest of the population but there is a lot of violence inside their own communauty ( aka the crime i put in the link before ) . 
  they are just seen as obscure `` parasites '' we do n't understand . 
  and since they do n't value the same way the material propriety ( they are nomadic after all ) and because of their education , stealing is not morally wrong for them . 
  it 's really difficult to understand what i 'm saying if you never met them . 
  but just keep in mind that they are completly different from the american black community .
