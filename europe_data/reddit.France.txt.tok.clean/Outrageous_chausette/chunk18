  edit : and even though they are pretty badly seen in our society , gypsy ( who are differents from roma ) are also a huge part of inspiration and are somewhat perceived as artists . 
  we may find them in a lot of our music/movies/comics like : la [ boh\u00e8me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwlc0j52b2i ) , [ gitano ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63k5vmx2bzm ) ( from a very famous gypsy singer in france , kendji girac ) , [ dalida - les gitans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aietygi3z4 ) , esmeralda in notre dame de paris , [ the camps of gypsy in asterix and obelix ] ( http://cdhlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gitane02.jpg ) ( it 's really a huge comic in europe ) , etc. . . plus , some of them have mobile funfair . 
  the childrens are often happy when they arrive in the city because of that . 
  they would not have been rejected if they tried to integrate our society . 
  it 's obvious no ? 
  we do n't reject them because of their color of skin ( the same way we do n't reject the black , the arab , the asian etc ) but because they never try to interect with us and just refuse to be part of our society . 
  it 's like a criminal nomadic amish community if you want a comparison . 
  also , see my former comment , i put some examples in a edit . 
  gypsy do n't have the same way of life than the black community in the usa . 
  if you want a comparison , the american black community correspond to our arabic/black community . 
  because yes , european countries are not homogeneous . 
  we also have black people , and contrary to the usa , a lot of them are immigrants from african countries and not 5th generation american . 
  the gypsy are nomadic and live in cast . 
  they refuse to put their childrens at school and teach them how to steal instead . 
  they stay in community and do n't want to be part of our country . 
  inside their encampment , it 's clearly a no go zone for the police . 
  they will always protect the members of their community and will refuse to cooperate . 
  we do n't know how they live . 
  i heard the woman rights were pretty much inexistants here . 
  they just do n't want to integrate , refuse our help ( cheap housing created specially for them ) , steal a lot to survive , `` invade '' illegaly our campus/stadium/field with their caravans if the mayor did n't find a place for them etc. . 
  if we reject them , it 's not because of the color of their skin , but their way of life which is incompatible with our values . 
  edit : one example of behaviour very common in the gypsy community . 
  3 years ago , in my little town , the gypsy stole for 500 $ of copper from a electric system in the area the mayor lend them . 
  [ for the city , this represent a minimum of 50 000 $ of reparation and the area is completly close to the visitors because of that . 
  [ they arrived with their caravan illegaly in the stadium charlebois ] ( http://www.letelegramme.fr/morbihan/auray/gens-du-voyage-trente-caravanes-se-sont-installees-au-stade-charlebois-03-08-2015-10727572.php ) . 
  we had to cancel all our match . 
  after leaving the area ( they stay here two/three month in general ) , [ they forgot a cadaver . 
  ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/rennes/1640231-20150626-bretagne-homme-ecroue-meurtre-auray ) and you know what ? 
  nobody was surprised . 
  we have the same opinion in western europe though . 
  but i do n't mind , it 's a pretty good one and the soundtrack is gorgeous . 
  edit : and asterix and obelix of course . 
  i forgot them ... we have a park for them . 
  yes , it 's something i would never understand . 
  i mean , it had been one millenary we fight each other in europe . 
  if a european country losed a war , he will never switch his language like that , just to please the conqueror . 
  that 's not how this work . 
  if they changed their language , it 's only after 200/300 years of foreign occupation , and even here , his language will have huges influences , but will never be the language of the conqueror ( english language with the plantagen\u00eat dynasty , spanish/french/portuguese / romanian after the roman empire , spain and the austrian empire etc. . . ) napoleon had a european empire for 10 years . 
  did the german switched their language during this brief period ? 
  even the urss had control over the eastern countries ( 3 million unhabitants in some of them ) for 80 years , did they changed their language ? 
  worse , hitler absolutly hated french people . 
  he would have never accepted they integrate his pure german reich , or even learn his language . 
  that 's the definition of nationalism . 
  after all , according to hitler , even '' * the peoples of islam will always be closer to us than , for example , france * '' . 
  i absolutly ** hate ** the coward stereotype . 
  i do n't mind being called * personnaly * a coward , but have some respect for our veterans and our history . 
  even if they had no choices , they still died to protect our country . 
  and i read this stereotype near every fucking day on the english internet . 
  even during the fucking terrorist attacks . 
  and i do n't really like being called a asshole because '' * one day , a friend of a friend said me a french guy laught at her in the underground . 
  french are so rude ! * '' . 
  and even tough i 'm not from paris , i do n't like as well the common justification from french people : '' * yeah , but you know , it 's the parisians who are asshole * '' . 
  no , the parisian are not a special alien , guys . 
  stop it . 
  for the rest of the stereotypes , if they are funny and said on the teasing way , i generaly find them hilarious ( the belgian and the british have tons of good one ) . 
  in fact , i likes them in general , except the surrender jokes which are just a big no for me . 
  plus , if they really enjoy history , they would love the [ puy du fou ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igoymtwjf8w ) . 
  and , it 's not that far away from the loire valley . 
  edit : there is a new show which openned in 2016 , it 's `` the beloved of verdun '' . 
  i also like the idioms like : * `` faut pas pousser m\u00e9m\u00e9 dans les orties '' * : do n't push granny in the nettles which mean '' you must n't go too far , or too fast . . '' * `` elle est aussi maquill\u00e9e qu'un camion vol\u00e9 '' * : she 's made up like a stolen car , which mean `` she put too much makeup '' * `` on a pas gard\u00e9 les cochons ensembles '' * : we did n't raise the pigs together which mean `` stop talking to me like we are friend . 
  we are not that close / you 're too informal '' * `` avoir le cul bord\u00e9 de nouille '' * : to have one 's arse filled with noodles which mean `` being lucky '' . 
  * `` prendre les vessies pour des lanternes '' * : to mistake bladders for lanterns which mean `` to think something is cooler/more beautiful than it really is '' * '' \u00c7a ne casse pas trois pattes \u00e0 un canard '' * : it does n't break three legs of a duck which mean `` it 's not that incredible '' . 
  - my dick hurts . 
  = i do n't care . 
  funny , in france , we say * `` je m ` en bat les couilles '' * , i 'm beating my balls = i do n't give a shit . 
  there is maybe a link ... 
  ah yes , french people tend to easily mock foreign accents . 
  we tend to be very clumsy about that . 
  i already heard french speaking persons complainging about that as well ( the marseille accent , the martinican accent , the quebec accent etc. . . ) and in general , when a french dude try to speak english , the french people around him will easily snigger . 
  it 's weird you sound portuguese though , i did n't excepted that . 
  but yeah , i know some flemish belgian who learned french in a erasmus program and i have to say , they had the stereotypical wallon belgian accent ( wich nearly do n't exist anymore in wallonia ) . 
  for the administration part , yes it 's a shithole . 
  and you are lucky , you are european . 
  i know a vietnamese girl who had to wait 2 month to have a debit card . 
  2 month only with cash !, 
  gosh ... 
  the educational part --  weird . 
  i find our educational system pretty brocken , especially when we have to learn foreign languages . 
  every time the english vo has a french accent , we put a [ italian accent instead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq3w-j7czdk ) . 
  here is pretty good website with the differents kind of [ architecture ] ( http://www.france-voyage.com/tourisme/architecture-panorama.htm ) we may find in france . 
  the list is not exhaustive though . 
  the last biggest political scandal i remember were [ j\u00e9r\u00f4me cahuzac affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_j%c3%a9r%c3%b4me_cahuzac_affair ) , [ the infected blood scandal ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/world/scandal-over-tainted-blood-widens-in-france.html ) , very huge affair , [ the wiretapping of elys\u00e9e affair ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/09/france.jonhenley ) . 
  but the biggest one in our history is the [ affaire dreyfus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dreyfus_affair ) i guess . 
  we even learn that at school . 
  ( well , you can understand it was a huge scandal only by seing the size of the * english * wikipedia page ) for scandals more ... personal which affected some of our politician , we can find [ strauss-kahn affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_v._strauss-kahn ) , francois hollande infidelity ( not a big deal in france , but it was huge on the international stage ) , [ the hidden girl of mitterand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mazarine_pingeot ) , [ the death of felix faure while he was still president ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a9lix_faure#death ) ( very funny to read ) etc. . . 
  i will say 1,4 in average . 
  obviously french , and some `` franglais '' . 
  i think that in the street , the average level in english would be a2 . 
  maximum . 
  they know some sentences , understand the context , but ca n't handle a conversation in english . 
  if you speak with a young french person , the level will increase to the level b1-b2 in general . 
  but often , they are not enough confident to try a conversation in english as well . 
  the immigrants and immigrants descendants know in general 2,4 languages . 
  the language of their parents/their home country , french and the english they learned at school . 
  their level in english is basically the same than the other french , so level a2 max . 
  if my region was sold ( britanny ) , it will be for the rosbif or the irish . 
  no problems with the irish , they are cool guys and we share a celtic culture together . 
  although , i think it will be near impossible for them to annexe us , since they are on an island and we are on the continent . 
  well , the british did that with ireland , but i find their borders not ... natural . 
  it 's weird .
