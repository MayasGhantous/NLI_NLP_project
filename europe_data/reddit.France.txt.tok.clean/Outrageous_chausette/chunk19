  if the english annexe us --  resistance . 
  we are part of france since a long time after all , we are too proud to join our oldest enemy like that . 
  we should ally with scotland and north ireland to take our independance !, 
  ( not the welsh , they betrayed us with brexit ) yeah ... that 's would be good . 
  sadly , you would have to learn our glorious language . 
  no exception , even for the bretons/catalan/basques / corsican/alsacian ... 
  never said i agree with the research . 
  i think it will happen , but waaay after 2050 . 
  that 's just the reaction of my friend which shocked me . 
  some songs : * [ couloucoucou stache stache ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpe1bjp8-4w ) : ... * [ la carioca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93akhvvzo3u ) : do you know how to dance the carioca ? 
  * [ banana split ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsqli9lfiwm ), 
  i do n't know if he was a neonazi , but my whole promo gave him the nickname `` le nazi '' . 
  i already spoke a little bit with him , and i have to say ... 
  he was so weird . 
  while i was waiting for the english courses , he was mumbling some song in german next to me . 
  i asked him what was the name of those songs , and he answear me it was hitler youth 's songs with a creepy smile . 
  sometimes , he was doing the nazi salute in the lecture theatre . 
  because he thought it was fun . 
  he hanged out with one of my friend . 
  i understand later that my friend became a racist biggot . 
  i think `` le nazi '' was a bad company for him , since my `` friend '' was n't like that 2 years ago ... 
  i also heard him speaking with a teacher at the end of a course . 
  he was saying we should kill the women who pactise the abortion and other nice stuff like that . 
  the teacher ( a woman ) said us he freak her out and always try to avoid him . 
  we learned later he stalked her . 
  edit : oh , i just remember an anedocte . 
  my `` friend '' may apply to the white supremacist category . 
  while we were looking at 9gag ( i know , but my friends only know that . 
  it 's quite popular in france ) , we spoke about this [ photo ] ( https://twitter.com/historicalpics/status/453974467564560384/photo/1 ) of the average woman in 50 years . 
  he was saying it 's a shame all this kind of interbreeding and that the typical `` white girls , blond with blue eyes '' are already endangered and that we should remove all the `` bougnoules '' out of france . 
  oh , and he think lepen will save france . 
  i do n't know if it enter in your definition , but we are very ashamed of the vichy regime here as well . 
  i mean , chirac admited the collaboration of the french state only in [ 1995 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpzms0wsoas ) ... 
  here is a photo of [ saint goustan ] ( http://cdn.nanxiongnandi.com/bing/auraydusk_fr-fr13118487783_1366x768.jpg ) , a part of auray 's city in brittany . 
  do n't know if you are from the usa , but this port also shares some history ties with the american one . 
  on december 1776 , benjamin franklin 's ship landed in this port to ask for french aid in the american war of independence . 
  in memory of this event , the biggest highschool of auray is named benjamin franklin . 
  i attended my courses here . 
  yep ... 
  i often see people hitchiking where i live ( brittany ) , especially in summer ( and during the festivals ) . 
  do n't know if it the same in the rest of france though . 
  [ i heard switzerland accidentally invaded liechtenstein ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13iht-edstamm.4893796.html ) . 
  some swiss soldiers get lost during their training . 
   the mayor reminded his listners that when napoleon 's troops invaded spain at the start of the 19th century , `` just one woman , who was old , wretched and bedraggled but a daughter of spain nonetheless , had on her own cut the throat of 32 frenchmen who were billeted in her home . '', 
   therefore , the mayor moved : `` the example of this women is enough to let the inhabitants of france fear that this village of lijar , although its has only l00 able men , proposes to declare war on all of france , since one man of this our village is worth 10,000 frenchmen . '', 
  kek , they are very proud . 
  thank you for sharing , it was very funny , 
  yeah , the habsbourg family really loved wars . 
  i guess the [ pastry war ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wyg0vyv.png ) with mexico . 
  more context : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastry_war#chronology_of_the_conflict, 
  at least , she has good tastes . 
  the [ belgians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oirtj4w3oqy ) on another hand  do you have this kind of stupid emission like confession intime and tellement vrai as well in belgium ? 
  [ and what 's that ? 
  bon vivant , a little `` simple '' , loves beer and french fries/mussel , always finish their sentence by `` une fois '' , a weird accent , a lot of good drawer and singer etc. . . 
  crazy and emotionally unstable ? 
  not at all . 
  where did you get this stereotype ? 
  they have pretty much the same stereotypes than the germans : pretty cold , efficient and frank . 
  they are also very discreet . 
  another common stereotype is that swiss people speak really slowly ( i have to say , i think it 's pretty true ) and use really weird words like nonante and septante . 
  at least , they say `` pain au chocolat '' . 
  it 's not a lost cause . 
  they have good watchs , chocolate , cheese ( fondue and gruy\u00e8re < 3 ) and our ministers love their banks . 
  they have a [ silly army ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/05/27/23/2920d7b900000578-0-image-a-9_1432767552839.jpg ) and love all kind of [ weapons ] ( https://images.knifecenter.com/knifecenter/sak/images/53861.jpg ) . 
  edit : a lot of french people try to be a border dweller with switzerland , so they have a swiss salary and have a cheaper house in france ( house are fucking expensive in switzerland ) . 
  those `` frontaliers '' have a bad rep in switzerland because of the `` they steal our jobs '' rhetoric . 
  france helped them to create their first nuclear weapon in 1966 . 
  not a big secret btw . 
  queue : a queue , a tail and a slang for penis avocat : lawyer and advocado tour : tower , circuit , trick vase : vase and mud chatte : a femele cat and a pussy ( same than in english ) cours : lesson , running , exchange rate and courtyard etc. . . 
  i heard it 4/5 times while i was in london ( i staid there 6 weeks ) . 
  never heard a welsh/scott/irish saying that , so i do n't know what would be their prononciation . 
  i like phonetically when a english person says `` that 's lovely '' . 
  do n't know why though . 
  here is the [ * american horror story * version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vrmc_l6sjy ) , i guess it will be ok . 
  well , i read [ this article . 
  ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-daesh-mean-isis-threatens-6841468 ), 
  ha yes , they want to be called islamist state because it gave them some recognition ( there is he word islam inside it after all ) while [ for the word `` daesh '' ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-daesh-mean-isis-threatens-6841468 ) ... 
  i always had been in scientific classes so maybe i 'm wrong , but i remember having learned a little bit of old french while we were in middle school ... we had to write some fairy tail with a `` old french '' style , but of course , it was n't very advanced . 
  sometimes , we used a verb which had disapear like `` ou\u00efr '' or we added a '' `` s '' instead of our accent '' \u00ea '' * like the transformation of the word `` for\u00eat '' which became forest or h\u00f4pital / hospital . 
  i understood english was finaly pretty close to french during those courses . 
  i have a friend who is at a faculty of art ( she want to be publisher ) and spoke sometimes about etymology . 
  i guess they learn old french and old english as well ( like shakespeare ) . 
  it 's a common circlejerk in france . 
  nobody like paris , even the parisians : it 's overated , there is a lot of polution , the parisian are stressed and arrogant . 
  and for the majority of our tourists , france = paris . 
  i knew it !, 
  kevin became pejorative in france as well . 
  they are often portrayed as the irritating 13 years old `` kikoolol '' who ca n't write correctly and are often `` a little bit '' mythomaniac . 
  paris . 
  the brother grimm 's tales were way more brutal than the perrault one though . 
  of course , it 's just that in france , the majority of the students do n't stay at their parents house during their studies . 
  since it 's the majority , the students living at their parents house only stay here because it 's easier economically . 
  but here , he do n't even see the point of leaving his parent 's house and was surprised by my question , it 's not only a question of economy , but culture . 
  oh , i did n't mention it , but he said me lived pretty far from his university ( 45 min ) . 
  but then again , it 's just anedoctal , all the south americans are n't like him . 
  my favorite fairytail is the [ ys city legend ] ( http://www.transceltic.com/breton/ker-ys-breton-ker ) from my region . 
  it 's a kind of breton atlantida in fact . 
  or a breton netherlands . 
  oh , and i loved the legend of merlin ( you know , the guy who helped the king arthur ) when i was a child . 
  according to our local legend , he had been enchanted by [ vivianne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lady_of_the_lake ) , a fairy who was in love of merlin and locked him inside the forest of broc\u00e9liande .
