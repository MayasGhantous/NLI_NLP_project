  and finaly , in an empire with germany , we would have been the dominated ( they have a bigger population and economy ) while uk is our equal . 
  they will be our vassal . 
  yep , we find this flag everywhere . 
  bretons tend to bring this one way more often than the national flag , even when abroad . 
  [ in burkina faso ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs06wctbram&amp;feature=youtu.be ) [ in the iceland clapping during the euro 2016 ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/rennes/1882907-20160706-video-euro-2016-drapeau-breton-incruste-clapping-geant-islande ) [ it is everywhere .

   france : ... different standards of body hygiene ... what do you mean ? 
  i have the impression most of the french in / r/askeurope are from brittany  and a lot of us are also women , which is pretty rare on / r/reddit . 
  and i have 3 breton flags in comparison ( because of the tour de france ) . 
  lo\u00ebzia for a girl and erwan for a boy . 
  same . 
  i guess it 's mostly because i say sneakers . 
   i ran from time to time  check the flair ... 
  i saw it in class when i was in highschool . 
  it 's pretty pedagogical , i really liked it . 
  i also saw goodbye lennin during those course , it 's now one of my favorite movies . 
  i recommend it . 
  personnaly , i really like it . 
  well , it must be understandable , but when they have a soft accent , it 's really charming . 
  when speaking french , i prefer uk accents over the american , the south african and the australian one . 
  but it 's my personal tastes . 
  and i also love the irish accent , it 's really cute , 
  i 'm 1m83 . 
  it 's clearly above average for a woman . 
  the [ battle of the pont saint louis ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bataille_de_menton ) was pretty badass as well , 
  we have a `` miracle '' battle against the dutch as well . 
  i liked this anedocte so much , i made a [ polandball comic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/61ga3l/grandpa_tells_a_story/ ) about that , 
  and do n't hesitate to visit r/socialfrance if you want to party with some parisian redditor . 
  or jean martin, 
  [ brittany share the same tune than the welsh one  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyvl9emw3hi ), 
  not at all , i learned it 2 month ago . 
  and sadly , nobody gives a shit about those buildings in my entourage :(, 
  they mostly speak french in bruxelles as well , so it would not change that much . 
  [ we have the 3 oldest building in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_buildings#by_age ) . 
  i live near the 3rd oldest . 
  world : english ( i only heard londoners speaking french , so this accent ) , italian , spanish and german . 
  france : [ martinique accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4u2qd4nh-i ), 
  * facho ( for fascist ) : often for lepen 's voters * collabo/nazi : often for lepen 's voters * ripou ( verlan for pourri : crook ) . 
  it 's dated , but usually concern the right wing party . 
  * gauchiasse ( mixt between lefty and diarrhoea ) and socialope ( mixte between socialist and bitch ) * bobo ( champagne socialists ) * [ bisounours ] ( http://asset3.replay.fr/photos/b7f/b7fad405eedc792ba5d5149958e23050.large.jpg ) : it 's a way to say you 're naive , utopist and live in another world . 
  but it 's not vulgar . 
  * communist ( often for m\u00e9lenchon 's voters ), 
  poland and russia . 
  h\u00e9h\u00e9h\u00e9 , take that uk !, 
  remind me this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/6cn2d4/le_couple_francoallemand/ ) . 
  for the legislatives , two representative of the fi movement ( m\u00e9lenchon one ) are named h\u00e9l\u00e8ne franco and jean-charles lallemand which gives `` le couple franco-allemand '' ( franco german couple ) . 
  some gossips pointed out the main candidat is lallemand while franco is just his sidekick ... 
  what ? 
  no , you are confusing it with our motto . 
   pigs head and feet i still do this . 
  i also like [ pork snout ] ( http://www.speedrecette.com/images/recettes/227253-1.jpg ) , [ cervelat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cervelat ) and [ beef tongue ] ( https://images.marmitoncdn.org/recipephotos/multiphoto/73/737454c9-4f29-4c49-9392-c3a88f5d4014_normal.jpg ) . 
  it 's delicious !, 
  but yeah , my own conscience is often confused when i eat some kind of meat . 
  the worst for me is when i eat a veal or a lamb . 
  i just feel ... bad . 
  i even prefer eating a horse over a veal , even if the second one tastes better . 
  how does it taste ? 
  horse riding ? 
  well , it 's the [ third most popular sport ] ( https://lesherosdusport.com/actualites/les-sports-les-plus-pratiques-en-france-en-2016-en-nombre-de-licencies ) in france , and it 's composed at 83 % by women . 
  but for the horse meat , it 's quite unusual , but pretty well accepted here . 
  i mean , we always liked trying some experimental food , so it 's not a big surprise . 
  i was surprised by the squirrel meat in usa though . 
  yep , especially in uk . 
  caramel with salt butter , of course !, 
  same with horse . 
  `` condamner '' and `` commander '' . 
  same meaning than the english words . 
  this stereotype come from the wwii . 
  when the americans arrived in france , they met a lot of women with hairy pits . 
  it 's understanding considering the nazi occupation and the rationing policy , but well , this stereotype is completly outdated nowadays . 
  [ vois sur ton chemin - les choristes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwxu8s6qdqu#t=0m27 ) ( so much nostalgy ),

  a guy was asking questions about relay . 
  but eddy malou completly missed the point and just invented new `` scientific '' terms .

  they did n't have a house , i just wanted to be helpfull '' . 
  he became a huge meme later , with jokes like `` they asked me to do molotov cocktails , i answered them i was n't barman '' or `` they asked me if i can make a bomb , i thought they were going to the swimmingpool '' etc. . . 
  haha , excellent !, 
  but , / r/whyweretheyfilming ? 
  [ my fav . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dludxistcuo ), 
  ok , i 'm gon na be downvote here , but i never understood why the `` french fries '' are specificaly from belgium and not just sometimes from north europe . 
  there is no historical proofs for this claim . 
  it does n't mean they are ugly , no ? 
  they are chubby , that 's all i heard about . 
  ugly women ? 
  never heard this one . 
  ( the stereotype goes for the british in france ), 
  * [ bluebeard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bluebeard ) : no need to explain why it 's gore . 
  * [ little red riding hood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_red_riding_hood ) : in the original version ( so perrault 's one ) , the little red ridinghood and the grandmother finnish eaten . 
  that 's all .

  * [ the tree little pigs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_three_little_pigs ) in the french wikipedia , they says it 's just a european story , and not only a english one .
