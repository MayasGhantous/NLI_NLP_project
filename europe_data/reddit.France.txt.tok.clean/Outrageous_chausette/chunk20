  there is a `` magic fountain '' and [ his tomb ] ( http://broceliande.slydventure.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tombeau-merlin-4.jpg ) inside it . 
  well , of course , when you are 8/9 years old during a school trip , it was more fun and impressive than now ... 
  but , because of that trip , i really loved the arthurian legends . 
  i read somewhere islamists hated when we use the word `` daesh '' . 
  always happy to piss them off . 
  1 ) i already met a scottish and a english girl who helped us in english at my university . 
  they did n't teached anything else so i guess it 's not mandatory to be an `` expert '' in another subject . 
  btw , history/political science skills may be interesting in some studies like at a history department , science po or even in a law college . 
  we do n't learn that much economy in law btw . 
  2 ) if you are interested by some studies in france , here is a [ link ] ( http://www.studying-in-france.org/how-to-apply-to-study-at-a-university-in-france/ ) which explain how to apply in a french university after your tapf . 
  btw , you should ask more questions at the university you will work , they may help you better than me for your orientation  3 ) i 'm currently a student in law in rennes 1 . 
  sadly , we do n't speak that much breton anymore ( i think it 's even worse for the occitan ) . 
  plus , rennes is in the gallo part of brittany . 
  gallo is a french dialect , while breton is a language . 
  [ historically , rennes never spoke breton in fact ] ( http://www.skolradio.fr/photo/art/grande/7075523-10831212.jpg?v=1413273671 ) . 
  however , it seems like breton lesson are gaining in popularity those last years , and some childrens are curently learning breton at school , even in rennes . 
  and rennais are very proud of their region ( like the whole brittany in fact , we are like the most chauvinistic region of france ) . 
  do n't worry , they will teach you some breton words . 
  if you are interested by brittany culture and history and consider to go in rennes , do n't hesitate to pm me for more questions  i recommend you to ask this question in / r/france as well , they often have good advices . 
  happy new year !, 
  oh , and sorry for all my mistakes , it 's really late and i 'm kinda tired . 
  i 've met some latin americans from mexico , equator , argentina , chile , uruguay and brazil while i was in london . 
  my general impression is that they seems , in general , more `` relaxed '' and rid of their complexes than the average european . 
  they were in general pretty openmind , always laught at the spanish accent of the chiliean guy and values more the family and the religion than in europe . 
  i remember having a conversation with a equatorian dude who was 23 years old about his student life . 
  i said him i was surprised he continues to live in its parents house during his studies . 
  he answeared me it was really normal here , that the majority of them leave their parent 's house near the age of 26/27 and that even if he had the money , he do n't see the point of living alone , without his family . 
  [ a little cultural shock i guess ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58sgn1/share_of_2529_year_olds_living_with_their_parents/ )  i also had some political conversation with a brazilian friend . 
  she said me that in brazil , even nowodays , there is still some racism between brazilians . 
  a dark brown brazilian will often be considered as poor and a thief at first sight . 
  but i ca n't really judge it since i have n't been here . 
  oh , and brazilian love football . 
  they always talk about it . 
  i remember having send a `` good luck '' message to this brazilian girl during the final of the fifa world cup of 2014 . 
  sadly , she was in hambourg ... 
  not in france but a french singer , jean-michel jarre had [ 3,5 million attended ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_concerts ) during a concert in moscow . 
  it was for the 850th aniversary of moscow . 
  there was a lot of laser , fireworks , and he even gave a live link to the russian space station . 
  i have to say , it looks pretty cool , with all [ those lasers . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwf6gtgglny#t=1m43s ) edit : oh , seems like he had [ 2,5 million attended in paris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nro2etdq_na#t=8m30 ) as well . 
  a real show man . 
  i have n't noticed more immigrants where i live , so nothing changed . 
  ( we do n't have that much immigrants in brittany ), 
  [ come on . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps3kxgo_gro&amp; ), 
  plus it really get out of proportion with the international media ( more particulary the anglosphere one ) . 
  there is 37 000 cities in france . 
  `` only '' 30 mayor decided to ban the burkini , all that to satisfy their right-wing electorate ( often in the south of france ) and say '' * look , we are doing someting . 
  vote for me ! * '' . 
  they knew it was illegal . 
  everybody knew it was illegal . 
  it was obvious the conseil d'etat will cancel those decisions . 
  and there is near no burkini in france , no , really it was so stupid . 
  but what piss me off the most is the media behavior . 
  they loves this kind of scandal . 
  they generalized by saying that it was a national law , invented some fucking stories to please [ their audimat ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20160926/aussie-tv-channel-accused-of-burkini-row-stitch-up ) and even promoted the burkini as a [ feminist symbol ] ( http://www.lci.fr/insolite/video-une-candidate-a-miss-minnesota-defile-en-hijab-et-burkini-2015202.html ) . 
  just no . 
  edit : it remaind me 2011 where everybody was saying france was islamophobic because we banned the veil , while it was just the [ burqa ] ( http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2013/06/14/1226663/736298-burqa.jpg ) . 
  huge difference . 
  pretty common here . 
   in france , more than one marriage in seven is mixed , i.e. 
  between a foreign man and a french woman , or a foreign woman and a french man . 
  the first type of union is slightly more frequent than the second : out of 239,840 marriages celebrated in france in 2012 , 16,237 counted a foreign groom and 15,810 a foreign bride . 
  in the majority of cases , the foreign spouse is of north african nationality . 
  next come european nationalities other than french , followed by sub-saharan african and asian nationalities . 
   source insee , october 2014, 
  i heard we have a pretty huge rap/hip hop scene in france . 
  well nowodays , the most popular artist is this guy : * [ maitre gims ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ydeyu61pii ) ( but not my fav artist : / ) well , maybe i 'm old school in fact ... * [ ntm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4uom7s38xa ) * [ mc solaar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkz8ufnoiwq ) . 
  he also has some songs in [ spanish . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20baknd9pug ) * [ iam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inud2d7r8bk ) really cool music . 
  * [ assassin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcixn0s3f5a ) * [ booba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hon6wnihsm4 ) ( but the old one . 
  his news music are shit , really . ), 
  * [ kery james ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzfcr3fpu4 ) * [ deen burgigo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efznoythqie ) * [ orelsan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdhzys2ozo ) * [ bigflo et oli ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eyokfm2bv4 ) ( love the lyrics ) * [ manau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khhwdfeyt_a ) * [ stupeflip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdaahmztnve ) i do n't know if they really fit here , but they are excellent and it 's sound kinda hip hop , no ? 
  and they are awesome irl . 
  germany, 
  in france , the average wage is close to 2202 $ net per month , so 2296.03 dollar . 
  keep in mind we also have a lot of `` free '' public services like free healthcare and free education at our disposition . 
  in a town , the average flat will looks like [ that ] ( http://www.terresetdemeuresdenormandie.com/site/images/normal/dieppe-maisons-de-ville-et-appartements51d3029eca067.jpg ) or [ that ] ( http://img.20mn.fr/pcyzrylyrbc6o_q1mytjiw/648x415_illustration-logement-paris.jpg ) with something like 70 m \u00b2 if you have a family . 
  of course , it depend where you live . 
  in paris , it 's near impossible to have this kind of flat , except if you are rich or a inheritor . 
  there is also more cheap flat which look like [ that ] ( http://www.fecampimmo.com/site/images/normal/maisons-appartements5329bf1755355.jpg ) more far from the centre of the city . 
  in general , city-dweller have one car , one scooter or nothing at all . 
  there are a lot of public transport at their disposition like the underground and a lot of bus so having a car is not a necessity . 
  there are a lot of parisian who never learned to drive for example , even at the age of 50 . 
  for the more rural area , i will speak more about brittany/the north , i know that in the south of france , they do n't have the same architecture . 
  so in general , we live near a little [ `` bourg '' ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/ploemeur/@47.7059033,-3.3828256,3a,75y,191.37h,64.87t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1shb_0uwh7k9ggmpbstva4-g!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dhb_0uwh7k9ggmpbstva4-g%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d98.02686%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x4810f522b2d48865:0x40ca5cd36e2c000!8m2!3d47.735695!4d-3.42714!6m1!1e1 ) with at least one boulangerie , a church , a hairdresser , a pharmacy , a supermarket , some restaurents etc. . . every week , there is a marketplace near the church where you can find all the local and fresh products . 
  the same can be apply to the cities though . 
  a lot of people will live in a little house in this little city which would look like [ that ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@47.7061289,-3.3829596,3a,75y,317.32h,98.2t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbukgzwzd_eqpgyoosd0s3q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  but in general , since it 's way less dense than in big city , we will find a lot of [ lotissements ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@47.6246969,-2.9226817,3a,75y,334.13h,75.55t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjwevjwqrsqiuzglfltcasg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) as well outside the city centre . 
  here is one of the most common [ house ] ( http://www.entreprise-josse.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img_5549.jpg ) we may found for a family . 
  those inhabitants have at least one car , even if in general , families have two cars ( because both parents works ) . 
  in this case , it 's near mandatory because we are far from everything . 
  the british ones , except `` for rent '' for me . 
  we learn british english at school but i guess some french people use the americans words because of the hollywood and american series influence . 
  but for me , british english is somewhat closer to the french language than american english , like the words humour/queue/torch / mobile phone/aluminium which are very similar . 
  it 's more spontaneous i guess . 
  but i thought estonian wanted to be into nordic , not slavs ... 
  i thought he was russian just because he spoke fluently russian . 
  i kinda feel stupid now : /, 
  physics .
