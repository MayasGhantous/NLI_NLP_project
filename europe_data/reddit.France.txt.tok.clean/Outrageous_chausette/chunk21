  the last map triggered me . 
  france , a religious country ? 
  history . 
  i have to admit it , i follow pewdiepie but only for his letsplay ( like walking dead , etc. . . ) i also follow [ life of boris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9cgsjqdave ) , a russian dude who teach us the `` true slavic life style '' and visit some eastern countries . 
  i though he was quite funny . 
  but sadly , my favorite youtubers are just some french ( [ wtc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecarkncxyrk ) , [ joueur du grenier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtb6zlaarv8 ) , [ les kassos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkyq4_vigkk&amp;list=plpkqoasyuip1hrm3lp3dkst_7yjihvtim&amp;index=1 ) ) and americans dude ( too much to list ) . 
  [ lastman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj6cpq0h8iu ) ( pretty recent ) . 
  the creators also have a [ youtube chanel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43ehs06ixla&amp;t=6s&amp;index=2&amp;list=plpkqoasyuip1hrm3lp3dkst_7yjihvtim ) with trash cartoon which will destroy your childhood . 
  there are english sutitles . 
  another of those creators made this very nsfw and wtf [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qfwo57wkwg ) . 
  some other dessins anim\u00e9s : [ pers\u00e9polis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gua0gpbnryc ) , [ les triplettes de belleville ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npro9kjyajk ) etc. . . 
  for the best looking , i really like the [ italian ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/it.en.html ) and [ german ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/de.en.html ) one . 
  for the worst , i 'm sorry cyprius , but your coin are [ kinda ridiculous ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/cy.en.html ) . 
  [ rochefort en terre ] ( http://www.monpetitmelimelo.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/header-incontournables-rochefort-en-terre-1024x377.jpg ) [ mont saint michel ] ( https://architecturehereandthere.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/mont-saint-michel.jpg ) [ najac ] ( https://i.sli.mg/ddwhwc.jpg ) [ bordeaux ] ( http://www.halcyontours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bordeaux-1.jpg ) [ rennes ] ( http://en.hotel-kerlann.com/usermedia/photo-635306451518100511-2.jpg?dummy=0&amp;h=800 ) [ rocamadour ] ( http://www.tourisme-lot.com/sites/tourisme-lot/files/styles/gallery_lightbox/public/cite_de_rocamadour_by_night_-_lot_tourisme.jpg?itok=r52k40e8 ) [ morzine ] ( https://images6.alphacoders.com/423/thumb-1920-423467.jpg ) i recomand this [ album ] ( https://sli.mg/a/nzzzve ) from / u/loulan as well if you are interested . 
  for a traditional festival , we have the [ historic festival ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=festival+historique+vannes&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=549&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewicyvhrqpdrahwfvxokhbzpb3oq_auibigb ) in vannes the 13 and 14 july . 
  we also have the interceltic [ festival of lorient ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvgipy2fdia ) , which is pretty huge . 
  there was 800 000 visitors in 2010 . 
  a lot of them are from brittany , scotland , ireland , wales etc. . . two years ago , the irish president came as well , that was really cool , 
  what ? 
  but french people love belgian jokes as well :(, 
  and for the irish , even more after the euro 2016 . 
  i know , it 's just that this add ( and of course , this sentence ) is pretty well know in france . 
  renault even did a parody for its own [ m\u00e9gane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_56iodbkvqs ) later ( we are already master in frenglish , now we try `` germench '' . 
  see the result : / ) . 
  i like this one as well : https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/rgurh/til_that_in_liechtensteins_last_military/ it was a during the austro-prussian war . 
  austria was fighting prussia and italy . 
  liechtenstein said he was neutral in this war , but send 80 men to austria because they were close allies ( a symbolic gesture ) . 
  [ france . 
  the last coup d'\u00e9tat in turkey . 
  do n't know why , it was too easy , there was not enough military preparation and the consequences it had after the `` failed '' coup d'etat like all those judges , minister ( etc ) who has been fired where strangly in favor of erdogan 's regime . 
  even nowoday , the russian ambassador who had been killed , the russian fighter jet who had been destroyed and all those links erdogan has with isis . 
  there is something fishy right now ... 
  but well , i have the impression the majority of european share my opinion so , do n't know if it 's really a conspiracy . 
  + ferrero ( and obvioulsy nutella ) , martini , glabani , diesel , gucci , , prada , alfa romeo , chateau d'ax ... 
  [ seems like . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sektpf3kcaq ) i just searched on youtube what was trap rap , and i found it . 
  i guess it 's pretty huge here , since even me heard about some of them ( edit : and except 5 or 6 rappers , i do n't know that much about rap ) . 
  gansta rap and all that kind of stuff is not my style ... 
  she also has english versions !, 
  i do n't know why , but i have a impression of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu . 
  i had the same conversation with a british guy on this sub . 
  maybe it was already you , 
  on the top automn 2016 : * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvk8skzbbwg * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0pmv7gotjc, 
  except andrea bocelli ( love his song * con te partiro * ) , i did n't know this genre . 
  it 's fucking good , they really have georgious voices : o, 
  here is a [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_french_expressions_in_english ) of french word we found in the english language . 
  and it 's without mentionning the common words we have from old french ( 1066 influence ), 
  no mention of [ them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swivbesd50 ) ? 
  l'international setting , comme je le disais , a deux langues officielles . 
  [ voil\u00e0 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurovision_song_contest ) . 
  dingue je sais ... 
  when you are agressive against one particular nationality , yes , it is xenophobia . 
  and looking your history , it 's seems the case . 
  maybe you disliked the jokes from french people about belgian stupidity , but it 's not a reason to become xenophobic . 
  popular ? 
  in electro , we have : * obviously [ daft punk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gajr4_cbppq ) , [ david guetta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dbehbkgoty ) , [ jutice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svq2ymuamvq ) , [ kavinsky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv_3dpw-bry ) , [ madeon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzq6graeoy0 ) , [ c2c ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1koat1vdlmc ) , [ bob sinclar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wofzs7lsfc ) , [ the avener ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqwu7nv3htm ) , [ m83 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lawyodrbr2q ) , [ feder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mptdcx36qzu ) , [ pony pony run run ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ino1-qysnnc ) , [ caravan palace ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubqgxey_zi4 ) , [ chinese man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqjensnunpm ) etc. . . * `` rock '' : [ noir desir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgcrvbjybe ) , [ shakaponk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lvwxq2f3ki ) , [ skip the use ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxf7wepbpi ) , [ pheonix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bjdnw7o6so ) ( useless anedocte : the guitarist of pheonix was in another band before this one . 
  it was a trio called `` darlin ' '' . 
  then , there had been artistic divergences and they separated .

  sadly , the most famous french raper singer are n't that good in term of lyrics ... * slam : [ grand corps malade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbvalwk7jsk ) i was surprised to learn he was quite famous in brasil ... * pop . 
  it will be really long . 
  i will just put the currently famous : [ indila ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kac5cocuk ) , [ tal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9gpvg6r8ec ) , [ kenji jirac ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fndmvpki1ms ) ... 
  there is also more ancien singers like aznavour , piaf , brassens , etc , but they are not that famous internationaly and belong to our grand father generation ( they are really great singers ) . 
  more recently ( 30 years ago ) , there is [ cabrel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmzvtfcu0zq ) , [ goldman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-er6v2zcy4c ) , [ myl\u00e8ne farmer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzgmpqn9zzc ) ... edit : others --  [ yann tiersen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iycrjmerw1q ) ( classical music ) , [ woodkid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vskb0kdacjs ) , [ christine and the queens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs40yxhjtxq ) ... 
  depend in wich situation . 
  if i 'm in the bus or the underground , the morning , barely awaken , i would find the small talk quite irritating and just answear politly . 
  but if i 'm waiting for a very long time ( like for 3/4 hours in a train/plane etc ) and see that my neighbour is as bored as me , i may engage a little conversation to pass the time . 
  generaly , i will just ask a random question like `` do you know at which hour we will arrive ? 
  i forgot . '', 
  and sometimes , after that , the conversation is set off pretty naturaly . 
  if they just answear my question and do n't ask any other questions , the message is clear , they do n't want a discussion with me and that 's all . 
  you have to feel it i guess . 
  yes , we have also the gitan ( manouche ) who are in france since way more time than the roma . 
  i even have the impression back then , french people tended to romanticize the gitan and they were kinda seen as poor artist in search of liberty . 
  for example , there is esmeralda in notre-dame de paris from victor hugo , the campsite of gitan in [ asterix and obelix in spain ] ( http://cdhlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gitane02.jpg ) , the songs [ `` la boh\u00e8me '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a314pvrsqim ) from charles aznavour , [ `` hijo de la luna '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iq9neocsns ) from mecano , [ `` caravane * '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhjoy0osd_y ) from rapha\u00ebl , and even more recently [ `` gitano '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63k5vmx2bzm ) from kendji girac etc. . . 
  they are source of inspiration . 
  the roma on another hand ... 
  because of theirlifestyle , they steal a lot . 
  the majority of the pickpockets in paris are roma for example . 
  here are some usualy methods they use : [ underground ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4et8rrgyqy#t=1m27s ) , [ false petitions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tso1rcuniss ) ( very often ) etc. 
  plus , we found a lot of their childrens begging money in the street or stealing insteed of going at school , while school is free here . 
  it 's really badly seen . 
  finaly , a lot of them steal metal ( coper , even train rail ) which can have big consequences . 
  they destroy some public infrastructures by doing that . 
  they also do a lot of `` wild campsite '' here . 
  we find them , from one day to the next , in the middle of a stadium ( so we have to cancel all the match ) or in the middle of a campus ... with a high increase of criminality in the area . 
  municipalities try to find a place for them , but as usual , they will excluse themselve from the rest of the population and they will not try to interact with us . 
  for uk , the first thing which cross my mind is `` pragmatic '' and `` phlegmatic '' . 
  do n't know why , i think it fit them . 
  what 's that ? 
  i though you was speaking about the [ sandwich am\u00e9ricain ] ( http://miamspeed.fr/image_149.jpg ) ham/tuna/chicken we found in every bakery ... 
  ok , / r/funny is that way , then -  . 
  i 'm pretty sure you have your place here . 
  you claimed there were fart jokes in this movie , while there is none . 
  if you had directly said `` i do n't like absurd humour '' or `` i do n't like this humourist '' , then yes , i would have trust you . 
  but you just said bullshits and invented facts . 
  where are your fart jokes then ? 
  may you link it ? 
  it 's not raging at those who disapprove chauvinism , it 's raging seing the same xenophobic person answering me the same kind of messages everyday . 
  if you do n't like me , just ignore me .
