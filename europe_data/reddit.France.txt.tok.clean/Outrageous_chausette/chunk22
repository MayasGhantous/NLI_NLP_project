  that 's all . 
  i 'm a woman as well ... 
  there is no fart joke in the live action , i bet you never watch the movie ... no , in fact , i 'm sure you never watch it but just spited on it because it 's a french movie . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  sincerely . 
  when i was in london , everytime i met a french family ( and there was a lot , especially near oxford street ) , there was the mom who was draging her child while he was screaming . 
  and obviously , the father was complaining near them . 
  complaining about the crowd , the weather etc. . . just by his face , you can guess he was frustrated . 
  even though i was n't enough close to them to heard french , i knew they were from our country . 
  and i was n't wrong . 
  yes , we can easily spot a french tourist , they often have a quechua tent in campsite , a book `` le routard '' , a child who is sreaming , and tend to complain about everything ... 
  in french of course . 
  remaind me one of my comment in [ another thread yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5i5e6v/which_european_country_is_the_most_smug_and/db5jv5r/ ) . 
  we are just fabulous , let 's face it , 
  mais ... meuf . 
  it 's the 6th answear of this kind you send me in less than 3 days . 
  and all in separated threads . 
  what 's your problem with french people ? 
  inferiority complex ? 
  and no , the animated comics are shit while the live action was a master piece . 
   [ looks like austria pretty like french song as well ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapgwvais3u ) sincerly , i think it 's really sad only france continue to use its own language for the eurovision ( with the exception of spain , italy sometimes and obviously uk and irland ) . 
  it 's supposed to be a european contest , with a share of our differents cultures . 
  now , it 's just shit pop song contest without any tie with the nationality . 
  we get the 6th place last year , only because our singer song in english the chorus . 
  it 's sad . 
  and for the announcer , they just use the second official language of the [ eurovision contest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union ) . 
  the same way we speak french at first for the jo because it was a french dude who `` invented '' it and it is now the official language of the jo . 
  and for the movies , may you give me some examples ? 
  sure , we have planty of bad movies , but there are some which are really good : intouchable , the 5th element , am\u00e9lie , la haine , asterix and obelix , cleopatra mission etc. . . 
  looks like french people agree with the fact [ we are the most arrogants in europe ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2013/05/blogs/graphic-detail/20131130_wom111_0.png ) edit : and for the least arrogant , i 'll say spain . 
  actually , my neighboor is cheminot and he admit it himself : he disagree with a lot of those strikes as well . 
  for the advantages , they have : * free travel in train everywhere in france for them and their family . 
  * a huge ce with a lot of '' [ village-vacances ] ( http://www.ccgpfcheminots.com/ ) '' . 
  they even benefit those village vacance during their retirements . 
  * the legal age for the retirement is 52 years old . 
  for a manufacturing worker , it 's 62 . 
  and they have a better pension than the other retired persons in the private . 
  * the cheminot have a pretty good wage : 3.090 euros you are speaking about the harsh conditions of living for those employees . 
  maybe , but i will not pity them . 
  we can say the same with a lot of other jobs . 
  i will play my whataboutist card here : what about a manufacturing worker ? 
  what about the family life of a doctor ? 
  a nurse ? 
  a airline pilot and the stewards ? 
  i even know lawyers in france who works under the smic for 50 hours a week ( le p\u00e9nal , ca rapporte pas ) , and vannes ' tribunal is in cessation of payments . 
  do you see them every 3 month on the media for a strike ? 
  for the `` being considered as shit '' part , well not more than the average . 
  being a '' train driver '' is even one pretty common dream job for little boy . 
  i think that being a garbage collector , fiscal inspector or a bailif is way harder . 
  the only reason sncf employees are denigrate by other workers would be because of the strikes . 
  the irony . 
  sncf employees are not more drawn in the short straw than the average . 
  and when they strike , everybody is paralysed and punished . 
  they should try more discussion with their employer or find another way of striking . 
  what irritating me the most in those kind of strikes is when the high school students strike as well , while it 's obvious they just want to skip school and do n't give a fuck about the law/reform . 
  i was in terminal ( so 17-18 years old ) when there was protestation against the retirement reform ( fixed at 62 year instead of 60 ) . 
  the 15years old students blocked the high school ( a blocus ) and boo us when we wanted to go in class because we wanted to study for the baccalaureat ( 2 month later ) . 
  but when you ask them why they are here , they are completly drop-out or recite what their parents/professor said without conviction . 
  it 's really cringy . 
  and the same for the sncf . 
  they already have a lot of privileges and are always complaning . 
  it 's never enough . 
  they have the behaviour of a diva and have a bad reputation in france because of that . 
  that 's what i was refering to . 
  a lot of people are proud of that and would mention everytime the resistance when there is a conversation about the wwii ( i agree with you , they are badass and it was really dangerous . 
  i personaly admire all the people who hided jewish people ) . 
  but a lot of those people will amplify the role and the number of resistants and considerablely reduce the number of collabo while in the reality , let face it , there was more collabo than resistants . 
  and i know , 90 % of the population just tried to survive the occupation by avoiding contacts with the germans ( let 's ignore those boches ) . 
  it 's still pretty taboo speaking about the colaboration . 
  after all , degaulle said that the whole france was [ `` r\u00e9sistante '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tlnmb-ytce ) just after the end of the wwii , and we had to wait until 1995 and jacque chirac to admit the part of responsability of france in the deportation of the jews . 
  i read a problem of stomach as well , but according to wikipedia , seems like it was just a question of style ( [ la fayette ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_dans_le_gilet#/media/file:marquis_de_lafayette_3.jpg ) , [ mozart ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_dans_le_gilet#/media/file:martini_bologna_mozart_1777.jpg ) etc. . . ), 
  for me , the biggest historical events in the current french history are : * the roman empire colonisation with the victory of jules c\u00e9sar . 
  latin is nowodays a source of our language , our law , our lifestyle etc. . * the french revolution which bring us democracy , enlightenment , the universal declaration of human rights and the metric system . 
  they also promoted the separation between the state and the clergy . 
  * napol\u00e9on : civil code , changed our administration , our laws , and spread it in the whole europe . 
  he was in the continuity of the french revolution spirit . 
  he is also one cause of our strong secularism . 
  for example , he is pretty well seen in the jewish community , because tried to emancipe them . 
  he overrode old laws restricting jews to reside in ghettos , as well as lifting laws that limited jews ' rights to property , worship , and certain occupations . 
  and i think this little guy changed the face of europe and even the world . 
  he spread nationalism in other coutries and indirectaly brought the independances wars of [ south american countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_american_wars_of_independence ) for example , and bring nationalism in germany ( which became a empire later ) , italy ( with the risorgimento ) etc. . . * the wwii : whith the nazi occupation and the collaboration . 
  even nowodays , we still are `` shamed '' of the collaboration . 
  it 's something pretty taboo here . 
  one another hand , the wwii brought the creation of the european union . 
  now , germany is our closest `` friend '' while before the wwii , it was one of our archenemy ( with uk ) . 
  france is nowodays in its longest period of peace it ever had with its neighbours . 
  it 's really cool . 
  a. . . wooden hand ? 
  i like them . 
  we should destroy portugal as well then ... [ here we go !, 
  ] ( http://giphy.com/gifs/napoleon-born2party-vabqbriiwcpno ), 
  i will add the moment when napoleon betrayed spain in 1808 ( dick move , nap , that was a dick move ... ) the fact that we were n't that much into settlement colonialism like england or spain . 
  ( it 's more by curiosity than angry . 
  what would have been a french speaking usa ? ), 
  and the war of algeria . 
  a stupid war which could have been way less bloody with some compromises from both side . 
  he was belgian , so i agree with you , 
  but french people are true [ franks !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n_ro-jl-90#t=2m45s ), 
  france is also a legit neighbour because of that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel,
