  oh , you will maybe like my favorite french author : maurice druon . 
  he wrote '' [ the accursed kings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_accursed_kings ) '' ( 1955 ) , a short saga about the kings of france and england just before the beginning of the hundred years war . 
  trust me , it 's very captivating . 
  another information : george r.r. 
  martin said that this saga was a huge source of inspiration and even said : [ '' * believe me , the starks and the lannisters have nothing on the capets and plantagenets . 
  it is the original game of thrones * '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26824993 ) . 
  [ the belgian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onapleg9efm#t=1m13s ) . 
  seems like our stereotypes about belgians are pretty true [ as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqagdkjb3k#t=0m09s ) .

  belgium ( especially wallonia ) . 
  i would say they are like the canada of france in term of culturaly similarities . 
  then , i would say quebec , and then italy . 
  we stole everything from italy btw . 
  we have a close language ( ~ ~ 80 % ~ ~ [ 89 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lexical_similarity ) % ( ! ), 
  similar ) , a close culture ( a lot of old monuments , a rich history ) , the same passion for food and wine ... 
  that 's british propaganda . 
  we are more seen as the delicate , rafined , calculating and traitor dude : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1ecj4lcq-s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir3fsl9wmdg#t=1m21s ( from uk ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5maqsjaqvle ( in the throne . 
  * well , after some minutes , he began to be pretty weird . 
  but i agree with him about uk . ), 
  well , except for this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qso0duy7-9s, 
  at least , you do n't have pepe le pew as [ `` representant '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op7k4lxm1re ) ... 
  he smell bad , is a sexual predator and pretty dumb . 
  perfect guy . 
  and i was wondering why the americans had this stereotpe about us ... 
   france waving the white flag already ? 
  well , that was to be expected . 
  i said * some complained . 
  it 's a french habit to complain about everything btw . 
  it concerned more the 30 + years old redditors who think it 's too pueril for them and are disapointed by the lack of real news . 
  we call that `` teq paf '' in france . 
  all began with this * [ cacapost ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/5ha6tq/bonjour_die_franzosen_essen_brot_die_deutschen/ ) . 
  now ? 
  the front page of r/france and r/de are full of k.k.krieg post and r/belgium is asking help to allies . 
  do n't know if the memewar will continue tomorow though . 
  some french redditors complained about this joke because it flood the frontpage of the sub . 
  do n't know if it 's the same in r/de and r/belgium . 
  which is stupid . 
  my ex was shorter than me . 
  if a guy has enough selfconfidence , there is no reason a woman will reject him because of his height . 
  even the stupid girls who posted `` a man under 6 ' is not a really man '' would certainly change their mind if they were hit on by a cute/funny short guy . 
  i have the impression the lack of selfesteem that some short men have is the same kind than the girls who have small breasts . 
  right , i read the 4 first threads of r/short , seems like they are quite salty : /, 
  lol , i 'm not desperate , but thanks for sharing , i 'll try it later  those jokes are just a bit clumsy , but never said in the attempt to be mean btw ( contrary to the fat jokes , the ginger etc ) . 
  i remember having seen this movie with a friend . 
  at the beginning of the film , we noticed there was french subtitles , even though they were speaking french . 
  we were like `` come on , i know quebecer accent is funny , but they exaggerate '' and joked a lot about it . 
  then , the movie began . 
  without the subtitles , we would have understood nothing . 
  and the disabled . 
  i 'm 1,83 m ( 6 foots ) female in france . 
  i do n't really like my height , i 'm really nonstandard , especially in france , a latin country where the average female population is 1 , 62 m ( 5 ' 3 '' ) . 
  everytime i met someone new here , the 3rd question will concern my height with some remarks like `` oh , you are as tall as my dad/bf ! '', 
  or `` funny '' and `` original '' jokes . 
  but at least , i have an advantage in basketball because of that , so it 's ok . 
  this page do n't exist dude . 
  we critics a lot about american policy . 
  that does n't mean we hate american . 
  this article is a critisim of globalism , not usa in particular . 
  he said that usa was the pure symbole of globalism , and that the terrorists are the `` virus '' which want to destroy it . 
   thus , it is no shock of civilizations , of religions , and it goes much beyond islam and america , on which one attempts to focus the conflict to give the illusion of a visible conflict and of an attainable solution ( through force ) . 
  it certainly is a fundamental antagonism , but one which shows , through the spectrum of america ( which maybe by itself the epicentre but not the embodiment of globalization ) and through the spectrum of islam ( which is conversely not the embodiment of terrorism ) , triumphant globalization fighting with itself . 
  in this way it is indeed a world war , not the third one , but the fourth and only truly world war , as it has as stakes globalization itself . 
  the first two world wars were classic wars . 
  the first ended european supremacy and the colonial era . 
  the second ended nazism . 
  the third , which did happen , as a dissuasive cold war , ended communism . 
  from one war to the other , one went further each time toward a unique world order . 
  today the latter , virtually accomplished , is confronted by antagonistic forces , diffused in the very heart of the global , in all its actual convulsions . 
  fractal war in which all cells , all singularities revolt as antibodies do . 
  it is a conflict so unfathomable that , from time to time , one must preserve the idea of war through spectacular productions such as the gulf ( production ) and today afghanistan 's . 
  but the fourth world war is elsewhere . 
  it is that which haunts every global order , every hegemonic domination ; - if islam dominated the world , terrorism would fight against it . 
  for it is the world itself which resists domination . 
   terrorism is immoral . 
  the event of the world trade center , this symbolic challenge is immoral , and it answers a globalization that is immoral . 
  then let us be immoral ourselves and , if we want to understand something , let us go somewhat beyond good and evil . 
  [ french reaction for the 9/11 attacks . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kbplcj1.jpg ) . 
  [ the french president jacques chirac was also the first foreign leader to visit wh after 9/11 ] ( http://www.weaselzippers.us/210681-flashback-french-president-jacques-chirac-first-foreign-to-visit-wh-after-911/ ) . 
  we supported you for the attack , but we were n't behind you for the iraq war . 
  there was not enough proofs about the `` existence '' of weapons of mass destruction in iraq . 
  we veto the un decision because of that and finally , it appeared that all this war had been caused for oil . 
  yes , english as well , but less than us . 
  that 's one of our politician who said a stupidity ( she is well know for being naive and kinda stupid btw ) . 
  she is currently the center of a huge [ controversy ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/12/04/segolene-royal-critiquee-pour-son-eloge-sans-nuances-de-fidel-castro_5043079_823448.html ) and several ministers already asked for [ her demission ] ( http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/cuba-jean-pierre-raffarin-reclame-la-demission-de-segolene-royal-7786127767 ) . 
  bush was n't seen as a nazi , just a douchbag who used war to make money . 
  i think you already know there was a lot of tensions between france and usa during this period . 
  and i have to say americans had been way more harsh toward us than the contrary . 
  here are two videos which sum up pretty well the opinion we have of george bush in france : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mvn1qmbsyu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgmpispofno, 
  maybe not as much , but i observed that italian tend to more use their hand than the rest of europe . 
  but it 's the same in the majority of latin countries btw ( we use it a lot as well in france ) . 
  it 's just the germanic and the nordic who are weird . 
  i really love `` le diner de con '' as well . 
  my favorite comedy after asterix and obelix mission cleopatra and monty python holy graal i guess . 
  for the second movie , i never watched it . 
  i will try it later , thank for sharing !, 
  boeuf bourguignon and foie gras . 
  this [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk-v7l0kaqs ) is also pretty good . 
  spend so much time on it . 
   seriously , i do n't know other videogames from france . 
  there are a lot from ubisoft but even though it 's french ( from rennes ) , their videogames are developped in quebec .
