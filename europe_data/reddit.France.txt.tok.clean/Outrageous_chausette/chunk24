  there is also * beyond two souls * , * life is strange * and * heavy rain * which had been developped in france ( paris ) . 
  in my opinion : [ asterix and obelix mission cleopatra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlhihcd6qtw&amp;t=37s ) , [ intouchable ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34wibmxkewu ) , [ joyeux no\u00ebl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krrr-cdxijs&amp;t=70s ) , [ un long dimanche de fiancaille ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnx2iuogvvi&amp;t=30s ) , [ oss117 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksnokzukugu ) ... for the best tv show , kaamelott . 
  good bye lenin --  love the music of yann tiersen [ in this movie . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfwwkcrth_a ) . 
  ah maybe , i misread the tittle . 
  i though it was just `` a game from your country '' and since ubisoft is from france and that its head office is rennes ( they are from brittany ) ... well , i will put beyond two souls and heavy rain then ( it had been developped by quantic dream , the locales are in paris ), 
  spain : they have a lot of beautiful beach and everythink is more affordable here . 
  all the spanish i met were very friendly and open minded . 
  and they are so proud of their regions ( i have a catalonian friend ) that i find that kinda cute and admirable  italy : it 's with italian guys that i had the most passionated conversations about food ( while eating , of course ) . 
  i know that in france we are kinda passionated as well , but italians are on another level !, 
  and they have so much beautiful monuments in italy ... switzerland : they have the best democratie in the world . 
  ( yeah , did n't met that much swiss guys * ) germany : the best christmas market , good beer , the best economy in europe . 
  very concerned about rules ( i had to learn to a german girl how to properly cross the road while the traffic light was red in london . 
  oh , and she panicked everytime we were late , even if it was 1 or 2 minutes . 
  it was cute and funny ) and really warm and welcoming . 
  luxembourg : never met a luxembourgish person as well , but i 'm kinda envious of their multilanguages skills . 
  belgium : they are one of our best pal . 
  well , especially for wallonia . 
  that 's weird , but they are so close of us in term of culture and language ( they do n't have a strong accent ) that we may considere them as french without meaning to ( no offense guys ) . 
  they have the best beer ( sorry for the german ) , the best comics and a lot of good singers . 
  uk : best humour in europe i think . 
  and they are very pragmatic about everythink . 
  that 's why i 'm not that much worried about brexit . 
  they will deal with this and bounce back as usual . 
  dishonored , assassin 's creed iv and life is strange i guess . 
  yes . 
  they had a overdose of cannabis . 
  edit : and no , space does n't mean pot in french if you asked that . 
  they used the english term . 
  it 's just a imagine for `` they were really high '', 
  yes , there are pretty beautiful as well  and for you op , what 's the most beautiful place of usa ? 
  it will be hard to choose , since we have a lot of beautiful [ landscapes and cities ] ( https://sli.mg/a/nzzzve ) here . 
  it sounds arrogant , i know . 
  in term of region lanscapes , i really like corsica : [ 1 ] ( http://www.isulavoyages.com/voyages/grandes/piana-ouest-corse.jpg ) ; [ 2 ] ( http://img0.mxstatic.com/wallpapers/af555f0867ca0d701858bb31716a64b9_large.jpeg ) ; [ 3 ] ( http://www.guide-evasion.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/shutterstock_117543997_opt.jpg ) , brittany : [ 1 ] ( http://www.ohmyfood.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bretagne.jpg ) ; [ 2 ] ( http://www.hotel-quiberon.fr/usermedia/photo-635609791825693371-1.jpg?dummy=0&amp;h=800 ) ; [ 3 ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8195/8114058926_fc3e11c9f3_b.jpg ) ; [ 4 ] ( http://en.normandie-tourisme.fr/docs/89-9-mont-saint-michel.jpg ) , rhone-alpes : [ 1 ] ( http://www.completefrance.com/polopoly_fs/1.4535122!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/image.jpg ) ; [ 2 ] ( http://www.completefrance.com/polopoly_fs/1.4535123!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/image.jpg ) ; [ 3 ] ( http://www.meteocity.com/medias/gallery/large/france/reg21/dptm04/montagnes-alpes-haute-provence.jpg ) and in term of building/food , i prefear dordogne : [ 1 ] ( http://www.lecomptoirweb.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/camping-sarlat.jpg ) ; [ 2 ] ( http://www.visit-dordogne-valley.co.uk/files/ot-valleedordogne/files/imagecache/image_bandeau/bandeau/st_cirq_lapopie_0.jpg ) but we also have la r\u00e9union : [ 1 ] ( http://www.reunion.fr/sites/crt-reunion/files/styles/gallery_lightbox/public/content/images/la_reunion_vue_du_ciel02_-_credit_irt_-_serge_gelabert_dts_12_2014.jpg?itok=f7juz9-9 ) ; [ 2 ] ( http://www.marseille.aeroport.fr/var/mpaeroport/storage/images/media/images/destinations/europe/france/reunion-1-mp/47293-1-fre-fr/reunion-1-mp.jpg ) ; [ 3 ] ( http://www.indian-ocean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cascade-aigrette-ile-de-la-reunion.jpg ) , tahiti : [ 1 ] ( https://cache-graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/destination/tahiti-133282.jpg ) ; [ 2 ] ( https://s.iha.com/00118042306/tahiti-bathing-in-the-lagoon.jpeg ) , nouvelle caldonie : [ 1 ] ( http://pacifique-a-la-carte.com/thumb/cache/037a837539f2191b5523ff4dc62c029f/249088/entete_img_nouvelle_caledonie_mare_15_053_dil_stephane_ducandas.jpg ) ; [ 2 ] ( http://www.lexpress.fr/medias/455/nouvelle-caledonie-terre-originelle-7_41.jpg ) as overseas territories etc. . .

  i found some translations : * [ d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance civile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-de4-ixmkr4 ) * [ suicide social ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1awn7hqxqx8 ), 
  only 5 years ago ? 
  : / ok then i found : [ indochine - college boy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp5u5mdargy ) : about bullying at school . 
  this clip caused a huge controversy because of the brutality of the clip ( you will understand ) . 
  the clip had been produced by xavier dolan ( very famous in france/canada ) [ keny arkana - d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance civile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fesmneycjm8 ) : civil disobedience . 
  critic of the actual world and ask a sort of `` revolution '' to change the system . 
  [ orelsan - suicide social ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2kvtrprvkk ) : a guy who want to suicide himself and spit out about all the problem of the french society ( but he do n't bring solution , just critics ) [ racaille ! - kery james ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbzfcr3fpu4 ) : reject of the actual politic . 
  kind of anti establishment in fact . 
  and the '' [ buche de no\u00ebl ] ( http://foodnetwork.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2009/1/5/0/ss1c06_buche-de-noel.jpg ) '' ? 
  and in my family ( do n't know if it 's the same for you ) for christmas , we can stay from 7pm to 1am at the table for a `` marathon dinner '' . 
  but if they phantasmmized france at the point to have a cultural shock , it 's that they are interested by france at the beggining no ? 
  i mean , i know some people who were really '' \u00e0 fond sur '' korea ( kpop , drama etc ) , spend 1 month here and came back here `` d\u00e9senchant\u00e9 '' as well . 
  but at the beginning , they were really interested by the culture of korea and know way more korean history and celibrities than the average european . 
  it 's pretty superficial i know , but manga is a huge part of their culture the same way we learned near `` everything '' about usa with hollywoodian spectrum . 
  and i 'm pretty sure you know a lot of cultural thing about usa because of theses movies . 
  it 's completly `` out of the reality '' , but they transfer us some part of their culture in their manga as well : naruto with ninja and ky\u00fbbi ( the fox with 7 tails ) wich is part of their folklore , bleach or death note with the shinigami ( sorte de faucheuse japonaise ) , plus there is always a scene with a japanese festival ( and the kimono and firework ) , always a tea ceremony , a scene with christmas ( not the same than our ) and the new year where they pray at the temple . 
  all that are cultural knowledge we have toward japan . 
  do we know folkloric creatures from vietnam as well ? 
  do we know their festival and religious celebration ? 
  for me , it 's nope . 
  and my two cousins who had been adopted from vietnam know more about japan than vietnam as well . 
  that 's sad , i know . 
  considering that france is the second biggest market of manga in the world ( i did n't say consumer , we pay more than the other for manga , that 's all ) according to japan companies ( and our market embrace shojo as well ) , a lot of people know more about japan than you think . 
  well , currently , we do n't have that much links with former indochina or vietnam . 
  while for japan ... 
  it 's the direct effect of the g\u00e9n\u00e9ration doroth\u00e9e quoi . 
  according to shueisha * ( the owner of jump magazine , which run , among others : one piece , naruto , death note , bleach , hunter x hunter etc. . . well , shonen ) * , france is the company 's largest market outside japan . 
  ** naruto ** [ ( source ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/2m62se/manga_sales_inside_japan_vs_outside_japan/ ) : japan : 1 000 000 - 1 200 000 france : 200 000 us : 18 000 - 28 000 ** one piece ** : japan : 2 900 000 - 3 100 000 france : 150 000 - 170 000 us : 5200 - 5400 ** fairy tail ** : japan : 450 000 - 490 000 france : 90 000 - 115 000 us : 2700 - 3000 because of this success , shueisha even decided in 2009 * to buy two [ french editor ] ( http://www.manga-news.com/index.php/actus/2009/08/28/shueisha-et-shogakukan-simposent-en-france ) because he want to implant the european and french market . 
  i mean , even nowoday , le monde ( le monde quoi !, 
  it will be the equivalent of ... bbc news i guess ? ), 
  has a special page consacred to [ manga ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/visuel/2016/10/15/manga-d-automne-la-selection-de-pixels_5014353_4408996.html ) . 
  in term of *** current *** * cultural * links , we have nothing similar with vietnam or even china in general . 
  and even though it 's `` only '' books , i consider them as the `` equivalent '' ( to a lesser extent of course ) of hollywoodian movies from usa in term of cultural propagation . 
  obviously japan . 
  france is the [ biggest market of manga in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manga_outside_japan#france ) ( france represents about 50 % of the european manga market ) and we organise the [ japan expo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japan_expo ) , the largest of its kind in the world outside japan .

  there is a top 10 of dumb news every weeks on a french website .

  i think so . 
  oups , my bad . 
  a london * er * accent . 
  i mistook because of paris * ian * : /, 
  when a foreigner is speaking my own language ? 
  for me , it will be the english ( londoner * accent i guess ) and italian ( more the accent from the north . 
  i had struggle to understand the south italian accent ) . 
  does n't change the fact it had been upvoted and commented a lot . 
  for me , it will be the french revolution and the napoleonics wars . 
  pizza and couscous . 
  i avoided the sub as well during this period and during the brexit , but they never said they were anti-eu . 
  in fact , all the brexiter were always downvoted . 
  they clearly did n't understand why uk left eu and are pretty `` federalist '' in general . 
  here is [ a post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bcvkn/nsfw_for_europhiles_europe_according_to_a/ ) from the sub for example .
