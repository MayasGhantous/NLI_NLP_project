  you have n't been here for a while . 
  it 's pretty much the contrary . 
  because french people are way more `` right-wing '' than usual . 
  jupp\u00e9 was a good compromise between the left and the right , in other circonstances , he would have been elected . 
  but not enough strict for the right wing . 
  fillon attracted the votes of the right and the extreme-right . 
  fillon will not touch the abortion law btw . 
  the same way he said he will not touch the same-sex marriage . 
  it 's always raining in uk . 
  they have to protect their head . 
  actually , i was n't inside the center of london ( too much expensive ) but near `` barking side station area '' . 
  and here , the sainsbury market was quite [ big ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/66+tanners+ln,+ilford+ig6+1qe,+uk/@51.5880555,0.0822147,3a,75y,327.23h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s486kibqk-bxw_z7qjbuimw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x47d8a6baa50cf2bd:0x8be53a6cb41b65bd!8m2!3d51.5884781!4d0.0817548 ) . 
  but you know , it was a joke . 
  i even found some little shops in the center of london specialised in cheese ( it was manadge by a french dude ) . 
  yeah , i remeber i shoked my german penpal when i said her we stay from 19 hour until midnight/1 am ( for the coffee ) at the table during christmas . 
   check the flair bloody traitor ... 
  guillotine !, 
  do n't lie to me , i went 3 month in london , i tried different sainsbury 's supermarkets . 
  there was more choice for the cr\u00e8me fraiche than for the cheese !, 
  argh !, 
  we pronone it like [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp3uy6lqfck#t=1m04s ) . 
  ( with the a of `` that '' ), 
  it will get worse . 
  mac-do here . 
   would mention italian or ** german ** ancestry i 'm pretty sure they would avoid saying that , lol , especialy for argentina . 
  there are a lot of spanish website , were only spanish speakers go . 
  in fact , the large majority of south america stay on spanish speaking website . 
  in france , i rarelly met french people on english speaking website ( except 9gag , which is pretty popular * sigh * ) . 
  the only exception is facebook and twitter , but all their contacts are french person and they speak french between them . 
  having cultural differences does n't mean you ca n't get on well ( and more ) with a foreigner . 
  at the contrary , exoticism is pretty attracting . 
  but still , i 'm pretty sure your neighbor do n't has the same cultural references than her . 
  he did n't watched the same cartoons than her when he was young , did n't had the same education , did n't eat the same food everyday ( for example , in france , we eat a lot of cheese . 
  in uk , they only know cheddar * sigh * ) , do n't have the same celibrities , the same music , the same movies ( i 'm pretty sure before their meeting , he did n't know * that much * argentinian movies ) , the same tv show , the same politics , the same landscapes , the same towns , the same way of thinking ( i.e. 
  the whole `` i 'm 1/15 irish and 1/32 polish '' in usa that ... nobody does outside of usa in fact ) , the same internet etc. . . 
  in term of cultural differences , comparing uk with greece/hungary or belgium is the same than comparing usa with argentina . 
  get it ?

  the end ... 
  the end of your life ? 
  that 's pretty depressive . 
  if i had to describe the personnality of france as a personification , it will be a grumpy middle age man who love to complain and think everythink was better before . 
  he will take a lot of antidepressants and is critical about everythink . 
  something good happend to him ? 
  he will say : `` yeah , that 's great , but what about problems a , b , c , d & e ? '', 
  but after seen his external facade , you will see that france is a idealistic guy who would like to set the world to rights . 
  he is a `` geek '' of politics and do n't understand that sometimes , because of his critisism , he is perceived as a moralistic morron and exasperate other countries , especially when he is right . 
  sometimes , it can even turn bad , i.e. 
  usa who is often in a `` you 're with me or against me '' spirit and disliked the behavior of france during the irak war . 
  but he do n't care and stay obtinated . 
  because of his politics passion , he became a big atheist after a existential crisis ( french revolution ) . 
  his main opposants in term of political view would be uk and recently his son , usa . 
  he loves to debate with them . 
  finally , even if france is depressive and self critical , he do n't understand that he has a complete and full life , that he is pretty rich , enjoy a good food , is a pretty handsome guy ( we have a lot of beautiful lanscapes here ) , has a blooming sex life , a lot of time to enjoy it ( a lot of hollidays ) , a big family who support him ( european counties ) and that a lot of other countries envy him . 
  his wife/husband will be germany i guess ( maybe i 'm too much influenced by polandball , but hey , they fit pretty well ) yeah , he will be the ** disillusioned and moralistic lefist professor of politics who always complain about his own life . 
  ** edit : and i disagree with the hetalia character . 
  see the comment of / u/itsacaragor above, 
   soundly beaten by the brits after 6 tries and the help of a european coalition ... 
  i noticed that as well . 
  while brits love to speak about waterloo ( and agincourt , you love that battle , right ? 
  ) , i never heard a german claiming the waterloo victory ... 
  i even have the impression they do n't even know they participed in this battle . 
  in fact , i never had a course about napoleon at school as well . 
  i had to wait my law studies to really understand why napoleon is so important for french history . 
  yes , it 's a shame . 
   duke of wellington it may sounds really ignorant but ... 
  i never heard about him and i 'm pretty sure the majority of the french population do n't know him either . 
  or maybe that 's just me ... well , we do n't talk about him at school , that 's sure . 
  for a strong parliament , we had the 3th republic which is a good example and worked pretty well . 
  for a strong gouvernment , we have the 5th republic . 
  i prefear the current one because there are more `` garde fou '' than the 3rd one ( lessons taken from the wwii ) and is more effective in general than the parliament one .

  * ( in french ) * they also stopped an imminent attack 2 days ago . 
  the 7 terrorists wanted to attack the strasbourg 's chrismas market . 
  [ le grand tourmalet ] ( http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2008/12/18/tourmalet.jpg ) which is composed by la mongie and bar\u00e8ge near the pic du midi in the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9\u00e9s . 
  i prefear the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es over the alps because , while the ski rail are less ample , the slope is more steep and there are more pine tree . 
  well , when a breton speak with another breton , we are not that much `` nationalistic '' . 
  only 10 % of the population can speak in breton , and nobody gives a fuck about our separatist parties . 
  when we speak about politics etc , we will only speak about the french one in its globality for exemple . 
  but , when a outsider of brittany come here , we are very proud of our region and tend to claim we are breton before french . 
  even is the tourist is french , and especially if they are parisian . 
  in fact , i already received some comments from erasmus studients who said me they were surprised because i was really proud of my region ( i wanted to teach them the breton specialities and i think i talked too much about breton history ... ) it sounded weird because i never had this feeling with others bretons . 
  we just do n't speak about brittany . 
  but we have a rich history ( for example , we have the [ first and the third oldest buildings in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_oldest_buildings_in_the_world#by_age ) ) , we still have a lot of [ `` untouched '' landscapes ] ( http://www.quizz.biz/uploads/quizz/403986/2_nd0y2.jpg ) which looks like ireland , and a strong tradition . 
  in each supermarket , you will find this kind of [ section ] ( http://www.produitenbretagne.bzh/sites/default/files/merchandising_breizhcorner.jpg ) . 
  it 's like mandatory . 
  i 've never seen that in other french regions . 
  plus , i have to say it 's pretty `` well seen '' to be breton in france . 
  we have the stereotype of being friendly alcoholic guys , just like the irish guys i guess . 
  plus , corsica and basque countries like us since we share the same regional pride and were separatists as well , and parisian likes us , because a lot of parisians come from brittany or have family roots here . 
  so yes , since our regional identity is pretty strong and that it 's not a shame to be from brittany , breton people like to say from where they are and like to travel with their flag [ everywhere ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/tv/sport/243633-euro-2016-un-drapeau-breton-s-incruste-dans-le-clapping-geant-en-islande ) . 
  like really [ everywhere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs06wctbram&amp;feature=youtu.be ) . 
  omg , 80 % of his comments * concerned child , pornography and pedophily . 
  wtf man ... 
  no , it 's just that they immediatly losed interest about me [ aka my nationality ] when i say them that i 'm not from paris , but just from the countryside of france . 
  especially when i say i only went 3 times in paris in my life . 
  so the subject of conversation concerning the so chic parisian area she visited 2 years ago or the next hollidays he was planning to do fall through . 
  i recomand as well [ le parc national d'ordesa et du mont-perdu ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7318/9682720982_6783c98b6b_b.jpg ) , [ le lac des bouillouses ] ( http://www.france-voyage.com/tourisme/lac-bouillouses-2060.htm ) , or [ le lac blanc ] ( https://lancoliebleue.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lac-blanc.jpg ) near the mont blanc .
