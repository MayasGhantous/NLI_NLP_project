  american : - * can you say something in french ? 
  your accent is so cool !, 
  * when i was in london , i also had a lot of questions about the terrorists attacks ( it was this summer ) and some jokes from portugueses about football ... oh , and when i say i 'm french , i often had this kind of conversation as well : - * you 're french ? 
  no way !, 
  i looove paris !!!, 
  i already went here 2 years ago and i was in the [ insert number ] arrondissement . 
  it was sooo cool . 
  where do you live ? 
  * - * i 'm not from paris . 
  i 'm from brittany . 
  * edit : formatting, 
  ireland and iceland . 
  [ le mec s ` appelle on . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdwzhaaf6ga ) ( pharaon = pharaoh ) the dude is called on . 
  he has a lighthouse . 
  it 's on 's lighthouse . 
  really ? 
  maybe it 's because of the bombardment during the wwii ... 
  since i only went in the k\u00f6lner dom in germany , i though it was the same than in france . 
  we still have a lot of old churches here , even though only old people use it . 
  no sane person will go in bikini inside a church which look like [ this ] ( http://img.zphoto.fr/data/photo/94/b6/433530.jpg ) . 
  and it 's fucking cold inside !, 
  what about the rock flooring ? 
  now , i imagine a german guy in bikini with his flip-flop/socks combinaison , a cap and his sunglasses taking pictures of the crusified jesus inside a old french church and saying `` ach ... sehr sch\u00f6n ! '', 
  every 5 meters . 
  perfect . 
  what ? 
  i never heard someone having a pb because she wear a bikini . 
  i live near the sea ( in brittany ) , and it 's not unusual to see women waking in a coastal town and even enter in some shops in bikini . 
  i did it a lot of times in carnac , near the beach . 
  well , it 's unusual if you do n't do that in summer though . 
  and who will enter inside a churche in bikini ? 
  it 's something normal in germany ? 
  we are not that pudic in france . 
  seeing girls in topless is pretty common , and we have a lot of naturist beach ( that german loves btw . 
  that 's even a stereotype here ), 
  but we have no problems toward bikini ... that 's even a french dude who invented this kind of clothes !, 
  did you mean ** burkini ** ? 
  i find this [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gsyozjhpte ) and this [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l90euztolps ) . 
  well , in france , we already have a pretty [ good birth rate ] ( https://libraryeuroparl.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/fertility2.png ) ( thanks to our pro family policy ) , so never seen this kind of campaign here . 
  what ? 
  and how do you call [ that ] ( http://cdn-9chat-fun.9cache.com/media/photo/amevzpg6o_480w_v1.jpg ) ? 
  a raisintine ? 
  guillotine !, 
  well , that 's not a circlejerk . 
  everybody know he is wide of the mark ... 
  scientifiquement , il n'existe qu'une race : la [ race de l'homo sapien ] ( http://www.ac-grenoble.fr/disciplines/svt/file/ancien_site/log/3eme/log_ebc/omhtmlexport/la_notion_de_race_n_existe_pas_pour_l_espece_h.htm ) . 
  some people which do n't know how to say properly pain au chocolat . 
  putin , hollande , renzi ( he is the president or the first minister ? 
  i do n't remember ) , rejoy , merkel ( not a president , but looks like ) , may ( same ), 
  no mention of the famous `` britannia rules the waves '' ? 
  well , maybe the marches are horrible idealistically , but they are `` in general '' , more interessing in term of historic background . 
  for the french one for example , it had been created during the french revolution , while france was in war against a european coalition . 
  the impure blood concerned more specifically the autrian invaders . 
  for the italian one , it has been created during their risorgimento , so the creation of a unifed italy . 
  it had been composed for a war ... against austria . 
  because fuck your austria . 
  the polish anthem had been created during the napoleonic wars as well , just after napoleon promised the creation of the duchy of warsaw , so it 's about the hope for a polish independance . 
  it had been created for a war ... against the austrian . 
  ... nah , just kinding . 
  the german one has been created to celebrate the emperor birthday , the english stole the french anthem from louis xiv ( which had been created to celebrate his anal fistula healing ) , the norway anthem had been composed for the 50th birthday of their constitution ... meh , i prefear mine . 
  even if brittany and cornwall are not countries , we share with wales the same tune . 
  * [ welsh anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtcoprrdum8 ) * [ breton anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct34lbdvgls ) * [ cornish anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojdzapejjao&amp;t=16s ) celtic heritage stonk !, 
  to improve my english . 
  and it works . 
  looks like more a pueril 4chan than reddit . 
  yeah , but sarkozy seems to have more chances to pass the first turn than holland . 
  what a pity ... 
  she will pass the first round , but normally , not the second one . 
  the worse scenario would be a second round `` le pen vs sarkozy '' which is the same than `` trump vs clinton '' . 
  sadly , in this situation , i think she has her chances to become president . 
  my grand father , who fought in algeria . 
  i had the question : '' do all the french people live on the eiffel tower ? '', 
  two years ago in san fransisco ... 
  personally , i do n't have the stereotype that american are idiots , just that they are self-centred and ignorants about other countries . 
  the 11 november is a national holiday in france . 
  make sense i guess . 
  with the rationing , i suppose they had better things to do than shaving . 
  yes , the stereotype with the striped shirts ( or marini\u00e8re ) and the onion rings came from brittany . 
  it was because we had a lot of trade relationships with uk . 
  and for the beret , it 's from basque county . 
  what i do n't understand though , it 's the not shaved woman stereotype . 
  thank you for the explanations !, 
  so when someone say `` as a french '' , it 's incorrect ? 
  we have to say `` french person '' at the place , that 's right ? 
  ( yeah , i 'm a women , it will be weird for me if i say `` frenchman '' ) does this rule has to be apply for other nationalities as well ? 
  like `` as a german ... man '' or `` as a swiss man '' ? 
   crapeau ( some kind of chair ) so weird . 
  in french , un crapaud look like [ that ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/bufo_bufo_03.jpg/270px-bufo_bufo_03.jpg ) . 
  if i remember correctrly , i had : - in primary ( 8-10 years old ) : the stone ages , vercingetorix and the gaul , ancien egypt - in middle school ( 11-14 years old ) : the roman empire , the old regime with the middle ages ( the separation between clergy / nobility / 1/3 estate and we learn some french king as charlemagne etc ) , the renaissance ( with francois 1er ) , the religions wars , the differences in term of architecture between a gothic and a roman church , the big discovery ( america , the world is not plate , gutenberg and the invention of the printing ) , the beginning of colonialism in america , the enlightenment , the french revolution and a short approach of the wwi ( do n't know why , it 's illogical , but i remember a middle class professor joking about the maginot line ) ... 
  in highschool ( 15-18 years old ) : the ancien greek republic ( because it had a link with civic education ) , the colonialism of africa , the industrial revolution , the wwi , the interwar period , the wwii , the cold war . 
  it depend of the school though . 
  and i 'm pretty disappointed i had to wait my university studies to learn something about napoleon . 
  but we have the procedure of `` indignit\u00e9 successorale '' ( article 726 du code civil ) . 
  if your child tried to kill you or if he killed you and had been convicted about that , he ca n't inherit if another inheritor askthe application of this procedure ( another children , the wife/husband etc. . . ) . 
  since france 's metropolitan borders have n't changed between 1936 and 2016 ... not really . 
  and i do n't want the colonies back as well . 
  oh , i remember having seen that [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5ly4mz15o#t=4m14s ) , it was kind of surprising . 
  seems like that during this period , netherland had a huge impact on the japan education as well . 
  i study in rennes as well , but i 'm from vannes .
