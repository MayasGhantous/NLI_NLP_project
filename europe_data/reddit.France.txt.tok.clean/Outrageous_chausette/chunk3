  at the end of this story , the pigs eat the wolf . 
  btw , most of our current nursery rythmes are subtiles metaphors of rape , pedophilia , hanging , torture , prostitution and even canibalism . 
  yeah , but it 's mostly about merlin 's legend . 
  i loved walking in broc\u00e9liande forest , so much nostalgy . 
  when i was a child , i was always trying to find some korrigans and fairies in this forest , like a paranormal detective ( martin myst\u00e8re < 3 ), 
  i do as well . 
  when someone says madame , i feel old :(, 
  my grandma was really young during the wwii ( like 3/4 years old , i do n't remember ) . 
  she losed her grandpa in the wwi , and her father in the wwii . 
  it was a stupid misunderstanding . 
  her father was a farmer , but liked hunting during the weekend . 
  at the end of the war , the germans found a rifle , hidden in their garage . 
  his brother he have n't seen for several years was part of the french resistance in another region , and already had been killed . 
  the germans thought there was too much coincidences and decided to execute him . 
  my grandfather was older , he was 8 years old during the war . 
  he did n't experimented the same bad experiences than his wife , but said me the rationing was really hard . 
  with the rest of the family , they ground some flour and hid it at the top of wardrobe . 
  they were afraid the germans found it and `` steal '' it for them . 
  but he had a much worst experience when he was a soldier during the algerian war . 
  same here . 
  i have no problem with people saying france commited war crimes ( torture , massacres , appartheid etc ) during this period , but i 'm quite piss off when they say it 's a genocide . 
  imo , the atrocities we ( and the fln ) commited during the algerian war does n't enter in the `` genocide '' categorie .

  ah , yes , maybe . 
  it 's just that i understandd what they were saying in occitan , and other french people were more pointing an accent ( marsaillais ) rather than a dialect . 
  the only other dialects i ever heard were the '' [ ch ` timi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iryzopwcctg ) '' and the '' [ gallo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tedjjdcnego ) '' . 
  and it 's not particulary beautiful : s, 
  [ occitan . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh2wgjfkwvg ) . 
  but it 's a dying dialect . 
  the english accent is definitly my favorite one . 
  it 's quite surprising , but i think the english accent is even more sexy than the italian one when they speak french . 
  but it 's just my personal opinion . 
  and it 's maybe because the italians i met were from south italy , so their accent was so strong , it was near incomprehensible . 
  i think the american accent is quite ok , it sound like the quebec accent . 
  so they have a `` friendly '' aura . 
  nah , they call us frog . 
  because we eat frogs . 
  the little prince . 
  exactly what i said to the greek guy . 
  it surprised me mostly because i have friends from south america ( mostly brazil ) who do n't gives a fuck about being topless , and they are far more religious than the population in europe . 
  plus , when i think of greece , the naked statues come immediately in my mind . 
  and since we can see some of them in public park in france , i thought it was the same in greece as well . 
  but tbh , it was the point of view of one greek guy . 
  he do n't represent the whole population . 
  and i know some french people who may be shocked by topless women as well . 
  ... maybe brittany sould join uk finally . 
  we tried our best to educate the rest of france , but they continue to use their sad and tasteless margarine . 
  i pity them . 
  plus , you have good cider , good beer , a lot of menhir and the same weither . 
  we will not feel homesick . 
  i 'm from brittany , so we have a lot of folklore here : * [ the diparition of the city of ys because of a beautiful princess , dahut ] ( http://www.ystari.com/the-city-of-ys/ ) * [ the korrigans ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=the+korrigans&amp;safe=active&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewih8ln76dntahul7bqkhvxbdssq_auibigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;dpr=1#safe=active&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=korrigan ) * [ the ankou ] ( http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/ankou ) * [ the lavandi\u00e8res de la nuit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/les_lavandi%c3%a8res ) * [ the broc\u00e9liande forest with the arthurian legends ] ( http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/text/tennyson-merlin-and-vivien ) aside those folkloric tales , another [ dahu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dahu ) is pretty well know in the south of france .

  i have two cousins from vietnam , one from china , two from ha\u00efti and one from poland . 
  they all had been adopted ( yes , there are problems of fertility in my family ) . 
  i always considered them as my cousins , even if they are not genetically linked to me . 
  they just ... grew up with me , and nowoday , it would be really weird to not see them at a family dinner . 
  i never heard them having problem of integration in france . 
  maybe a little bit at the beginning for my ha\u00eftian cousins ( they were 4/5 years old when they arrived ) but nowoday , since they do n't have any foreigner `` accent '' , i do n't think they would be considered as foreigners . 
  well , to be honest , i do n't really know , i never spoke about that subject with them . 
  well , i think some french people may be quite critical concerning the german gouvernment and , more particulary , the way they run the eu . 
  but it 's not against the germans population , just the gouvernment . 
  the far left wing dislike the austerity they `` imposed '' over the southern european countries and greece in particular . 
  the far right right wing are in a `` muh sovereignty '' phase . 
  but except that , i never heard bad things concerning the germans in particular . 
  germany is the `` showcase '' and the leader of the european union , so our extrem wing politicians like to attack it because germany represent ( for them ) europe . 
  we have the same stereotype about the southerners . 
  like the `` beauf '' we found in les marseillais or [ camping ] ( http://fr.web.img3.acsta.net/r_1280_720/medias/nmedia/18/36/09/10/18603154.jpg ) with dubosc .
