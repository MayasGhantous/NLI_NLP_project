  but yes , there also a lot of rednecks in the north . 
  i drink cider for a while , even when i was a child , so i do n't know . 
  maybe 8/9 years old ( it was a soft cider very close to apple juice to be fair ) . 
  but the first time i had been really drunk , i was 15 years old . 
  for the new year 's eve . 
  we did it in one side of my family . 
  it goes back to the french revolution , and it was ... really disappointing . 
  all farmers and all in the same 30km area . 
  worse , the same surnames came back way too often in the family tree . 
  edit : a word, 
  oh , the feelings :( it was so popular when i was in primary school . 
  if you want my own interpretation , i think it 's about how the wind ( the time ) will blow away everything . 
  your house ( the little sand castle ) , your loved ones ( the mother who disappear ) , in fact , everything will disappear . 
  at the end of his song , he says :  during the tide rises ( * i think it 's a metaphor of the time * )  and everybody is doing its accounts ,  i will take in the hollow of your shadow  dusts of you so you have to accept the fact that one day , you will die , and you should focus on what matters , so not the beautiful building , not your money , your career , but your loved ones . 
  pretty depressing song in fact :(, 
  sorry , i will put several , i ca n't choose : * [ denez prigent : gortoz a ran ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwahvbaygv4 ) ( in breton ) * [ dacw ` nghariad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrkgdj0bvao ) ( in welsh ) * [ nathalie cardone comandante che guevara hasta siempre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssrvtltwfs8 ) ( very famous ), 
  nah , in general , they are pretty cool with tourists . 
  except maybe the parisian one . 
  but , do n't try to move in corsica ( once again , especially if you 're parisian ) . 
  all the families i know who moved here came back 2 years later because they had problem to integrate with the locals . 
  they are very nice with you if you 're a tourist , but it 's not the same if you 're a new unhabitant . 
  `` sweden is an islamic shithole under shakira law ? '', 
  ( i read it on internet by some far right morons ), 
  and what about the `` petits pains '' ? 
  it makes no sens !, 
  chocolatine ? 
  * '' * i voted for lepen/fillon/macron / hamon/melenchon * '' * if you 're a parisian in paris : '' * oh , you 're a provincial ? 
  so , how does it feel being in a civilized place ? 
  * '' ( true anedocte ) * '' * you 're from corsica ? 
  you 're just italian then * '' . 
  ( do n't try it with a corsican , they are really hot-blooded and proud of their region ) * '' * what 's your point of view about [ notre dame des landes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/notre-dame-des-landes ) ? 
  * '' * '' * i think france is not responsable of the [ vel d'hiv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vel%27_d%27hiv_roundup ) * '' . 
  ( try that with anybody who do n't vote fn ) * '' * i think the colonisation of algeria was a crime against humanity * '' ( say that to fn voters . ), 
  * try a surrender joke . 
  etc , etc. . . 
  i forgot a lot of them to be honest : /, 
  since my tastes are pretty weird , i will just point the most famous one .

  i 'm stupid . 
  what ? 
  the first air ballon flight was from the [ mongolfiers brothers ] ( https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/27/114727-004-424c89b4.jpg ) , in 1783 . 
  * exageration : i think it look likes the english humour . 
  we exagerate so much our story , it 's near impossible to believe us . 
  but contrary the english humour , which is completly absurd ( like , i do n't know , a silly walk ministery ) , our humour is more down-to-earth and less fantasist . 
  * `` second degr\u00e9e '' : it 's basically sarcasm . 
  * mockery : french sense of humour is more oriented toward others than themselves , less nonsensical than english humour and more mean . 
  it is combative , fueled by ridicule and mockery and it needs a target.the french are great teases , which contribute ( for naive foreigners ) to our reputation of being rude . 
  we also love comedies where we can mock a dumb person ( [ the dinner game ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fangiunbia ) , [ kaamelot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsgcso6h0zq ) ) * we also like a quite `` crude humour '' and dark humor , which can easily be vulgar and bad taste . 
  for example , charlie hebdo have this kind of crude humour , where the goal is to shock or provock a snigger/cynical laught . 
  in this case , they exagerated excessively a statement to illustrate its falsehood . 
  the journalists/catoonists do n't agree with the statements they use , they are making fun of them . 
  in term of more basic crude humour , for example , there is this [ youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikdkuldgqwm&amp;index=11&amp;list=plpkqoasyuip0qdcpe3ntlugam4384ztb0&amp;t=2s ) ( nsfw , english subtiles available ) which is really popular in youtube france . 
  i do n't think this kind of humour is that exportable . 
  * we also like [ political satire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mvn1qmbsyu ) , good word pun etc. 
  it would have been much worst . 
  for the moment , it 's mostly pro-melenchon who do n't want to vote because '' * lepen or macron , it 's the same shit * '' vs pro-melenchon who will vote for macron because they do n't want lepen as president . 
   usa 's poor health care system , invading other nations , not using the metric system , being fat , being ignorant i think those critics are pretty true , but that does n't make europe a greater place . 
  your country has its own problems , but it 's the same for european countries . 
  in general , european countries have more poblem than usa for integration and immigration . 
  usa also produce way more movies and music . 
  if we do n't take europe in its globality , we can see that there are problems of corruption in eastern countries , there are problems of unemployment in latin countries , there are problems of integration in scandinavian countries etc. . . europe is not perfect , and we know it . 
  the problem is that , on internet , we interect a lot with vocal and ignorant americans ( the one who voted trump and follow fox news ) . 
  especially on reddit , where 70 % of the redditors are americans . 
  on reddit , european ( and people from other countries ) learned a lot obout usa and its politics on reddit . 
  but the contrary is less true , mostly because reddit is still an american website , so the subjects are often focus on your country . 
  plus , there are also quite a lot of americans who really think their country is the best in the world ( often from t_d ) . 
  this overpatriotism is really weird for an average european . 
  we associate this kind of behaviour with the wwi and the wwii , so nationalism . 
  i bet you already read american exceptionalism on reddit , just check / r/shitamericanssay . 
  but have you ever read a swedish dude saying his country is the best in the world ? 
  a spanish ? 
  a japanese ? 
  imagine if it has been macron vs m\u00e9lenchon in the second round ? 
  i do n't know if the sub would have survived . 
  in fact , i think that if op claimed he was n't american at first , the people in the comments would have been less harsh or at least more pc . 
  the same way , i think that if a frenchman posted an article about , i do n't know , '' * which country have the most attractive population ? 
  * '' and that `` weirdly '' , france was ranked n \u00b0 1 , we would get the same kind of comments than here . 
  it just seem ... arrogant , i do n't know . 
  and yes , i think that since south america is pretty `` obscure '' on the international stage , the country which come immediatly in our mind is brazil , with its football , rio de janero , sao paulo and its beautiful and exotic beach . 
  to be honest , i would have put brazil in my top 3 , but mostly because i have brazilian friends ( and they 're cool ) . 
  speak for yourself . 
  i care way more about the events which involve european countries than the americans one . 
  and if we complain about their actions , juste take a look at their president . 
  i think the answear is in the title of the thread . 
  european are really sick by this american exceptionalism , always claiming `` usa # 1 !, 
  '' , `` we 're the best country in the world '' . 
  and we have a lot of american troll in this sub . 
  it 's just something wich seems really arrogant and that 's probably why some redditors were more harsh than usual about usa in this thread . 
  maybe , but he is more progressive and `` socialist '' than hillary , that 's why i think he is closer to trudeau policy . 
  plus , contrary to hillary , he has no scandal ( for the moment ) and is still pretty `` fresh '' in the french political spectrum . 
  exactly . 
  and i think that if i spend more time in australia/nz ( like 3 month ) , the `` cool '' vibe will disappear , because it 's less mysterious . 
  personnaly , i think it 's better . 
   an inferiority complex not really , no . 
  personaly , i thought usa was the coolest one when i was a teenager , mostly because of the tv shows , the holywood movies , the fast foods , the music etc. . . 
  but later , i learned english . 
  nowodays , i know a lot more about usa than before , especially after discussions with natives on internet . 
  it 's not a country as `` mysterious '' as it was , and finally , except some cultural differencies , you 're not that much different from us . 
  then , there is australia and new-zeleand . 
  some of your cool friends went here for 2 weeks , and loved it .
