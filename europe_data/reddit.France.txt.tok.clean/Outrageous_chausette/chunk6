  the construction of our national idendtity did n't happen in one instant but took several centuries . 
  i 'm in favor for a eu army and a federation ... 
  just 8 month after brexit , uk threatened spain over gilbraltar ... 
  as much sense as french letter . 
  we call that condom as well ( `` capote '' in french ) . 
  it was just a reference to the `` french letter '' word in english . 
  we do n't use this idiom on a everyday basis , but it still exist . 
  i have the impression france and england shares this idiom : * for germany , uk , spain , greece and portugal , it 's the french . 
  * for hungary , italy , france , romania , poland and * ukraine , it 's the english . 
  according to the french google , it was a reference to the hot and cold tap water in two separated tubes in your shower . 
  why scottish , and not just brittish though ? 
  because during the 20th century , the scottish contrast bath therapy was pretty popular here ... 
  me neither . 
  i guess it 's from the stereotype of the souks we may found in maghreb which are pretty convivial open market . 
  in small towns , everybody know eachother and the by word of mouth practice must have been pretty common , especially during the 19th and 20th century . 
  an since a lot of those countries are former french colonies ... 
  nothing at all , it 's just that the english says `` french letter '' while we say `` english condom '' here . 
  but the large majority of the french population only says condom , without the nationality . 
  oh , i forgot one : we also `` russian mountains '' for rollercoaster . 
  we say : * * speaking like a spanish cow * : when someone butcher our language . 
  * * build castles in spain * : build castles in the sky , you are losing your time with unrealistic projects . 
  * * run away like an english man * : when someone leave a place without saying goodbye . 
  so very discreetly . 
  * * english condom * : a condom . 
  * * a scottish shower * : emotional rollercoaster . 
  * * being strong like a turk * : being very strong . 
  * * being the turkish head '' * : being a punchbag for bullies . 
  * * va te faire voir chez les grecs * : i do n't really know what should be the translation of `` va te faire voir '' in english , but the idea is * get lost in greece !, 
  * in the same spirit that the english idiom * go to hell !, 
  * * * he losed his latin * : when someone stammered . 
  * * being drunk like a polish man * : no need of explanations here . 
  * * drinking in switzerland * : drinking alone , without friends . 
  * * the arab 's telephone * : by word of mouth . 
  * * it 's all chinese for me * : i do n't understand what you are saying . 
  * * an indian line * : a queue . 
  and of course , i will point that italian pizza are shit and nobody surpass dominos pizza in that matter . 
  [ after all , italian americans invented the pizza , and what the world thinks of as pizza is strictly american ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/4w9wwp/italianamerican_on_pizza_americans_did_invent/ ) . 
  there 's far better pizza in new york than , let 's say , naples . 
  `` this pizza lack of pinapples , no ? '', 
  i 'm not original , but romanticism ( 1800-1850 ) with william turner , caspard friedrich and delacroix . 
  for more `` recent '' artists , i also had the occasion to see some salvadore dali 's paintings in tate in london . 
  it was really weird sometimes , but i absolutly loved it . 
  french bread is the best in the world, 
  wait ... 
  it also had been played by hans zimmer ? 
  [ and it has 10 million view on yt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdbyrjlrvyq ) and had been played in [ south park ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=litery3hhre ) ? 
  that 's awesome !, 
  oh really ? 
  i never thought la tribu de dana was famous somewhere else than in france . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  you should ask to / r/france as well , 
  not really in france . 
  we have some popular song about our regions , but not in a different dialect or language . 
  the only song pretty popular which came in my mind is [ tri martolod ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezbnselblvg ) from brittany , but i 'm extremely biaised and i do n't know if other regions know this one . 
  all my granparents losed their grandfather in the wwi . 
  but one of my grandmother alos losed her uncle and father in the wwii . 
  it was bad luck , her dad had a shotgun in his garage because he loved hunting . 
  his brother that he had n't seen for a long time because a quarrel , was a resistant and a communist supporter and had been executed 2 month ago . 
  for the german soldiers , it was too much coincidences . 
  but she was only 3 years old when her dad died , and she never really known him . 
  later , she grew up in the post-wwii spirit , so with the volonty to create a strong franco-german friendship , even at school . 
  later , my mother learned german as second language at school and invited several corres at home . 
  so no hate from my grandparents . 
  we do the same as well in france , except for this one since the french version was the vo  it 's sad they did n't keep the english and french voices , it make the scenes more moving and more ... 
  [ logical . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-csrqrdlfeo#t=12m30s ), 
  honestly , i pretty liked the movie . 
  it has a lot of clich\u00e9s , but there is a plot-twist at the end so it was ok . 
  i really pity the german girl , she had a lot of dilemma to face and it get the '' [ joyeux no\u00ebl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqhxngjxczg ) '' ( a very good french movie , with less obvious clich\u00e9s ) spirit because the characters were speaking different languages ( and i really like that , it feel ... european , i do n't know ) . 
  but yes , it 's the perfect definition of a french movie . 
  that and maybe the xavier nolan 's one , even though he is not french . 
  [ relevant video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zvu0usquri ) ( there are english subtitles ) it 's mostly boring movies where the main character has existential questions . 
  weirdly , i pretty like them . 
  the last movie of this kind i saw was frantz , a very complicated `` love story '' between a former french soldier and a german widow just after the wwi . 
  you understand it 's a french movie with [ the trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g7hgkwtzye ) : it has all the clich\u00e9s . 
  in general , we love wwi and wwii movies and have a lot of shitty comedies . 
  i have two of them . 
  they play scenes of verdun , gladiators and knight battles in their spectacles . 
  but it 's more a show than a reenact , even though the scenery and the costumes are pretty realistic . 
  * [ verdun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6lslp3noy0#t=4m45 ) * [ vikings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48em0epz_ms#t=14m40 ) * [ knight tournament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3yewauddyo#t=9m15 ) * [ gladiators ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtjobndkpyo ), 
  there is also the [ puy du fou ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqvuhlt4j7i ) theme park with a lot of reconstruction in vend\u00e9e . 
  it 's the second most popular park after eurodisney in france . 
  the majority of the actors are volonteers ( 12 000 persons ) but i do n't know if it enter in your criterias ... 
  i thought it was american since i saw this recipe on reddit pretty often and because they said they were inspired by the movie ratatouille .

  for us , it 's often '' * france is not paris !, 
  i 'm a french and this is false !, 
  i do n't know for you , but i often feel petty irritated after reading the comments in this kind of video . 
  it 's often nationalist french people , americans who say france is under shakira law , or surrender jokes . 
  he was curious as well , but i think he was n't mentally prepared for dominos pizza :p now , i know it 's not the good recipe , but back this time , i really thought it was the italian one . 
  my mother always cooked like that and even on internet , a lot of those recipes are the french version one . 
  it 's stupid , i know . 
   it 's like i give you a piadina and call it an italian crepe , it just fucking is n't ( and i would also trigger anyone between parma and rimini ) . 
  if you call that a ** italian ** crepe , i 'm ok with that . 
  and i 'm from brittany . 
  a lot of countries have variant of `` crepes '' , it 's really a basic recipe after all .
