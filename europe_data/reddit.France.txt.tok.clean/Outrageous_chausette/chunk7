   i do n't see it having a lot of success not a surprise . 
  it is !, 
  haha , i remember having an argument with a italian guy because my pasta carbonara looked like [ that ] ( http://www.lesfoodies.com/decaux/recette/pate-carbonara ) ( wrong pasta , no parmesan and gruyere insteed , cr\u00e8me fraiche , onion and no egg ) . 
  it 's the french way . 
  so later , i bring him to a dominos pizza for a little avenge ( he said me it doesn ' exist in italy , is it true ? ) . 
  then , he complained about the meal for 1 week . 
  that we are pessimistic and grumble about everything . 
  and also that we love confrontation and debats about futiles subjects , that was my impression while i was speaking with foreigners . 
  i think it 's the same in a lot of countries though ... 
  you just said :  please do n't go topless or make out in the beach , there are little kids . 
  you implied women who were showing there breast were obscene . 
  inapropriate would have been a more respectfull word . 
   i hope you do n't believe modern greeks are this phallocratic too because you saw a couple naked statues . 
  no of course . 
  i 've never been in greece , so i do n't know where they are , but here , we can see those old statues in the public area ( like a park etc ) . 
  and since greece has a larger proportion of those statues , i thought we can see more of them in the public area as well . 
  you had to say that at the begining and not imply women who show their boobs on the beach are slut . 
  honestly , i always thought the greeks had the same point of view about nudity than the other latin countries , especially considering your history ( antiquity ) and the fact you have a lot of nude statues as well . 
   balls are just balls and vaginas are just vaginas too , but people do n't go around showing them off . 
  come on , it 's not the same . 
  boobs are just boobs while vagina and penis are sexual objects . 
  a woman breast should be perceived the same way than a male breast . 
  i do n't know how this work in your country , but contrary to usa , boobs are not censured on the tv here . 
  i even already saw a report on the national news broadcast a topless woman who was showing where she wanted a tatoo to hide her scars from her former breast cancer operation . 
  children are used to see that , and on the beach , a lot of little girls are topless as well . 
  it 's the teenagers who sexualize boobs , not the childrens . 
  [ kaamelott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsgcso6h0zq ), 
  yes , but it 's weird seing that 11/20 of the top comments are from armenian , it 's not the same proportion in the other songs . 
  maybe there is a conspiracy somewhere ... \u0ca0_\u0ca0 edit : no , but really , all the comments are from armenian . 
  it 's crazy . 
  yep . 
  but they are less beknow than champagne . 
  we can also add pastis and chouchen , 
  do n't forgot champagne . 
  weirdly , a lot of armenians seems to like this song according the youtube comment section . 
  but polish nation and polish history existed before this treaty . 
  and after the creation of the duchy of warsaw , it became a state again , and a close ally . 
  i think i see poland differently than the other puppet state because there was a huge support of napoleon , he was seen as a savior , while in germany , spain , italy , belgium and netherland , he was a conqueror . 
  not part of the french empire . 
  even though napoleon was n't really clear about poland , he recreated the [ duchy of warsaw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_warsaw ) . 
  he received a huge support from the nationalist polish because he promised to recreate poland in his globality . 
  the gouvernement was n't handle by a member of napoleon 's family , but by a close ally . 
  but poland existed before napoleonic wars ( euiv taught me that ) . 
  it was even one of the most liberal country in europe for a long time . 
  we also had a strong alliance with poland during the napoleonic wars . 
  edit : and weirdly , we were also ally of the ottoman empire for a long time . 
  scotland is our oldest ally . 
  if you want to read his work , i found [ this website ] ( http://www.online-literature.com/maupassant/2988/ ) with the translation of most of his novels and short stories . 
  i have to say , it was my favorites classics . 
  nowodays , i mostly read english and american fantastic books and polar from sweden , so not that 's why i do n't know famous french authors ( except marc levy , but ... not my style : / ) . 
  i also avoided the obvious notre dame de paris , the little prince , around the world in 80 days , perrault work , the beauty and the beast , the `` fables de la fontaine '' , because they are too obvious . 
  well , the authors may be famous , but i do n't think their books are well known outside france : * [ maurice druon , the accursed king ] ( http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780008117559/#sm.0000spd1ceey6ed4xs82mxk40q80g ) saga is my favorite one . 
  * [ victor hugo , the last day of a condamned man ] ( https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hugo/victor/last_day_of_a_condemned_man/complete.html ) * [ voltaire , candide ] ( https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-448j-darwin-and-design-fall-2003/readings/lecture4.pdf ) this book is pretty fun , especially if you are interested by the age of enlightenment .

  no mention of camilla l\u00e4ckberg ? 
  her books are pretty famous here .

  [ you forgot this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo7wn40lfbe#t=0m20s ) . 
  i said that i was non religious at all , but i still celebrate chritmas and easter in the church with the rest of my family . 
  it 's mostly to please them and i do n't participate to the rites anymore ( i just stay mute during the whole ceremonie , and do n't participate to the communion etc ) is it ok ?

  and she is pretty good  edit : [ clara morgane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldjawlc6jhs ) and [ liza monet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4zqc2s-dqm ) tried music , but it 's ... well .

  oh , i love so much william turner 's work . 
  my favorit artist . 
  i would add [ le radeau de la m\u00e9duse ] ( https://www.franceculture.fr/s3/cruiser-production/2016/06/4ebf3af5-79bb-4bdf-a92c-ce06588b1eda/600x337_radeau_de_la_meduse_gericault.jpg ) from delacroix . 
  in fact , we are better in term of sculpture , with the [ statue of liberty ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cdclaaswoaeep16.jpg ) by gustave eiffel ( well , kind of ) , [ christ the redeemer ] ( http://www.merveilles-du-monde.com/christ-redempteur/images/photos/christ-redempteur-002.jpg ) by paul landowski or [ the thinker ] ( http://www.musee-rodin.fr/sites/musee/files/styles/zoom/public/resourcespace/1051_4b7adf46d20e8f7.jpg?itok=cxqmornp ) by rodin . 
  of course they were not alone !, 
  we were very racist during the 19th century , thinking those poor african were dumb and need some civilization . 
  we even had [ human zoo ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ce/b3/7d/ceb37de79e0719b89abd71b9c09c9902.jpg ) in 1931 , do you imagine it ? 
  and for the anti-semitism ... it was ~ ~ way ~ ~ something way more common than what we think nowodays . 
  and in the allies countries as well . 
  yes , i think a lot of western countries had this kind of belief at one moment . 
  check the work of the italian [ lombroso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cesare_lombroso ) ( ironically , he was jewish ) if you are interested , it 's really informative about the mentality of this epoch . 
  edit : his ideas were very popular in france . 
  he thought the `` born criminal '' existed , and that we can prevent a crime by lock up the people who had [ particular traits ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=atlas+of+lombroso&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj6mc6jgy7tahxdmhokhvizbhmq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=549#imgrc=ugdqffssyin9bm: ) . 
  finally , the more you were ugly , the more you had risk to be a criminal .

  exactly !, 
  when i was with her , i had the impression being the mommy duck trying to cross a road with her duckling . 
  it was quite cute in fact . 
  are we really having a fight about which country is the most pessimistic ? 
  [ the stronghold of reignac ] ( http://www.maison-forte-reignac.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/maison-forte-de-reignac-coupe3.jpg ) . 
  it 's a fort which had been built into the rock face in the xvi th century . 
  the inside of the fort is full of period furniture ( pic [ 1 ] ( http://www.maison-forte-reignac.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grand-salon-maison-forte-de-reignac-e1458122942779.jpeg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.maison-forte-reignac.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chambre-de-la-comtesse-maison-forte-de-reignac.jpeg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://p0.storage.canalblog.com/00/28/363481/77614002_o.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.perigorddecouverte.com/include/image/mont-reignpgd08essai6.jpg ) ) and we can visit a little musuem about torture during the midle age ( forbiden under 18 years old . 
  the descriptions were really gross : pic [ 1 ] ( http://www.justacote.com/photos_entreprises/maison-forte-de-reignac-tursac-1363522892.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.justacote.com/photos_entreprises/maison-forte-de-reignac-tursac-1363522556.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://p4.storage.canalblog.com/47/53/1039903/92586306.jpg ) etc ) . 
  i also pretty liked the obvious versailles castle ( pic [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a8/79/ba/a879ba704c548feef9fecb98924896aa.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.filfranck.com/versailles_palace_hall_of_mirrors_minibus_tours.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/vue_a%c3%a9rienne_du_domaine_de_versailles_par_toucanwings_-_creative_commons_by_sa_3.0_-_073.jpg/1200px-vue_a%c3%a9rienne_du_domaine_de_versailles_par_toucanwings_-_creative_commons_by_sa_3.0_-_073.jpg ) ) and the chambord castle ( pic [ 1 ] ( https://cdn.chambord.org/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/canal-%c2%a9-dnc-photo-lds-1200x675.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://zoomsurlafrance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/chambre-dapparat-300dpi-%c2%a9-guillaume-perrin-1024x682.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.my-loire-valley.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/chateau-bussiere-interieur-gilles.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.photos-de-villes.com//photos/images/centre/loir-et-cher/chambord-loir-et-cher/escalier-du-chateau-de-chambord.jpg ) ), 
  even in london , the huge queue to enter inside the bus were really [ long and disciplined ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/cby3h5/a-queue-of-people-waiting-to-board-a-red-london-bus-cby3h5.jpg ) . 
  i noticed that while i was teaching a german girl how to cross the road when the traffic light was red . 
  some stereotypes are true . 
  it 's cultural i guess . 
  latin countries are pessimistic about everything . 
  a shitty day in london . 
  i had a little `` fight '' with an english girl in a londoner night club . 
  we were too much inside it and someone push me because of a lack of space .
