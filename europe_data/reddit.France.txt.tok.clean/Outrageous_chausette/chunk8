  i felt on her back while saying `` sorry '' . 
  i guess she did n't hear me , since she push me back harder with her ass . 
  so i pushed her back as well . 
  i knew she was angry , so i made a sideway step to avoid her `` final attack '' . 
  she fell flat on her back , her mini-dress split because of the shock . 
  after that , she screamed at me , and pursued me inside the club . 
  it was quite funny in fact . 
  later , at near 5/6am , i took the underground to go back home . 
  during the ride , a guy accosted me . 
  he was completly drunk , and i think he was `` trying '' to hit on me . 
  he was near my age , and said me he was a new-zealander in hollidays in london . 
  he spoke for like ... 15 minutes , but i understood nothing . 
  it was 5 am , i was tired , we were in the underground ( so a lot of noise ) , he had a fucking strong accent and he was so drunk , he barely could walk . 
  well , since he understood i did n't care about what he was saying , he began to insult me , and became really agressive . 
  so i get out at the next station . 
  when the door closed , i saw him vomiting inside the underground .

  your country is the 7/8 biggest in the world . 
  nothing to be ashamed . 
  italy has a good economy . 
  you 're now the 3rd biggest economy of eu . 
  since i was 13 years old . 
  i 'm 22 now , but the rest of my family still think it 's just a `` phase '' and that i should be ashamed to want being atheist , because atheists do n't have any kind of morality .

  francophony is pretty important for us , especially in quebec and africa . 
  but we do n't think that much france is super relevant . 
  i even have the impression it 's the contrary , regarding our usual pessimism about everythink . 
  what ? 
  i just spoke about the franco-german friendship in this thread and you ... 
  i tought we had something * special * ... :'(, 
   colonialism oh , did n't excepted that . 
  arf , we do the same with wallonia ... now i feel bad . 
  and aside the usual surrender jokes , what kind of jokes do you heard about french people ? 
  personally , i prefer `` compost '' . 
  well , yes , i guess the ( very ) old generation may have some resentment against germans because of the war , but it was a long time ago and near all of them are dead right now . 
  even my grandmother , who losed her greatfather in the wwi ( soldier ) and her father in the wwii ( bad mistake . 
  he was n't a soldier , nor a resistant . 
  just a hunter with a rifle in his shed . 
  but the germans thought he was part of the resistance because of that : / ) , but she is still pretty germanophile . 
  she never knew her dad ( she was 2 years old when he died ) , and grew up during the european constuction , so it was a generation full of hope for the future . 
  and back this time , the franco-german friendship was really [ strong ] ( http://img.aws.la-croix.com/2016/05/29/1300763580/francois-mitterrand-helmut-kohl-22-septembre-1984-douaumont_2_1400_932.jpg ) . 
  the difference is that , contrary to 1871-1914 , the gouvernment teached them that germans were our friends at school , that 's why they are less `` revanchard '' than before . 
  no , if you want to find people who are xenophobic toward germans , it 's in the extrem right and the extrem left wing . 
  and it 's mostly because they think that germany , leader of eu , have too much power over the french sovereignty ( same way than the brexiteers in fact ), 
  we do n't have that much fireworks in my area ( it 's often raining ) , that 's maybe why . 
  oh , yes , cr\u00eapes salidou are the best !, 
  do n't know , but it 's something important for this day , much more than just marching in the innercities as you said . 
  i never heard about that . 
  maybe that 's only because they have a lot of tourists from germany , i do n't know . 
  in general , they are even more germanophile than the rest of france , since it 's where they teach the most german in the country . 
  [ indeed . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usschoqttyq ), 
  you forgot the fireworks :'(, 
  do n't know if it 's the best friendship within europe , but we sure speak a lot about the franco-german friendship here . 
  the 22 january , we even have the special franco-german day to celebrate . 
  portugal ? 
  cr\u00eapes , waffles and pastries i guess . 
  google translation say it is !, 
  btw , french and catalan share a lot of similar words . 
  i remember it was easier for me to read catalan than spanish or italian , and i only learned german and english at school !, 
  - `` salut - un moment , colonel ! '', 
  same in french and romanian . 
  it mean `` hi !, 
  one moment , colonel ! '', 
  and airbus , ariane ( not only made by french engeeners of course , but there are more french in those projects than other nationalities ) .

  on daily basis , it 's necessary . 
  plus , i heard germans stare a lot . 
  so do n't worry op , they stare everybody , it 's not because of your skin color , it 's just ... cultural i guess . 
  i ate [ rice and a cod with butter sauce ] ( http://img.cac.pmdstatic.net/fit/http.3a.2f.2fwww.2ecuisineactuelle.2efr.2fvar.2fcui.2fstorage.2fimages.2frecettes-de-cuisine.2ftype-de-plat.2fplat-principal.2fdos-de-cabillaud-au-beurre.2f1247930-2-fre-fr.2fdos-de-cabillaud-au-beurre.2ejpg/1600x1600/crop-from/center/dos-de-cabillaud-au-beurre.jpg ) ( it was frozen food ) . 
  then , i ate an apple . 
  for the dinner , a [ galette bretonne with an egg , 5 portions of goat cheese , honey on it , bacon strip and salad inside it ] ( http://www.foodreporter.fr/upload/original/6/r/y/4/i/331510.jpg ) . 
  then a fromage blanc as dessert . 
  they never spoke breton in rennes btw . 
  in the west of brittany , we may heard some breton from our grandparents ( like insult , orders and this kind of stuff ) but the younger generations do n't speak it , even though they mostly understand it ( do n't know if i 'm clear ), 
  do n't know , but it sound german ( with the burg at the end , like luxemburg , strasburg etc ), 
  a lot of fairytales from brittany : * [ merlin and the lady of the lake , ( called viviane in french ) ] ( https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/i/idylls-of-the-king/summary-and-analysis/merlin-and-vivien ) . 
  brittany , wales and cornwall share a lot of tales . 
  so i heard this one during my walk in [ broc\u00e9liande forrest ] ( http://arbredevie.melleambre.fr/wp-content/uploads/hetre-du-voyageur-broceliande-1.jpg ) when i was 8/9 years old . 
  i also heard a lot of tales about the arthurian legends and thought for a moment arthur was a breton knight :( * [ the legend of ys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ys ) that my grandfather used to tell me ( in simplified and embellished , of course ) , in plus of tristan and iseult . 
  edit : wrong link, 
  he must be from alsace-lorraine ... 
   i 'd chose brittany a thousand times over the rest of france toi , je t ` aime bien . 
  in france , the problem is that there are always a lot of tourists everywhere ... 
  in which city would you like to go in france ? 
  i will only speak about paris and north of france for the moment , but if you have a region in mind , do n't hesitate to ask me informations about it  for paris , except the obvious landmark we find in every touristic map : * [ la sainte-chapelle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/sainte-chapelle_gnosne.jpg ) * [ les catacombes ] ( https://www.mylodgevent.com/arbre/108/principale.jpeg ) ( do n't try it alone of course ) * [ le manoir de paris ] ( http://www.lemanoirdeparis.com/ ) * not paris , but the [ castle of versailles ] ( https://www.parisianist.com/assets/img/articles/palace-of-versailles/en/palace-of-versailles-hall-of-mirrors.jpg ) is cool as well .
