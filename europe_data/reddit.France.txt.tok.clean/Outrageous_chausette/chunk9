  when i think of brittany beach , i have this [ picture ] ( https://latribudanaximandre.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/la-rose-des-vents-c3a0-poulfeutuen-copie.jpg ) in my mind . 
  i have a renault megane and it 's a mess . 
  but i bought it in occasion , so maybe that 's why it had so much technical problems . 
  generally , my entourage say that renault , peugeot and citroen are okay . 
  not the best , but it 's pretty affordable and easy to maintain . 
  i also heard that the alliance renault-nissan and dacia were pretty popular as well , but do n't know if it enter in your question ... 
  avril * , 
  doit ... r\u00e9sister ... * it 's raining outside !, 
  * shit . 
  speaking proper english and drinking tea ? 
  if you speak french , you should try a french speaking country like france , belgium , switzerland or luxembourg . 
  if you are syrian and homosexuel , i bet you have high chances to be accepted as a refugy here . 
  we do have a lot of muslims , as you said , but they only composed 7 % of our population . 
  plus , here , we just do n't speak about religion . 
  it 's something private , so no need to speak about this subject . 
  for example , i found out one of my friend was muslim only 1 month after our first meet . 
  she refused to eat a saucisson . 
  her bestfriend is gay and her boyfriend is atheist . 
  of course , it 's just an anedocte , but just keep in mind that most muslims here are tolerant . 
  just avoid poor banlieues and prisons and everything will be alright  finaly , you have more chances dying by falling from a ladder than a terrorist attack . 
  do n't fall in their game , that 's what they want . 
  england then ? 
  i woulslike to see a discussion between him and [ joey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwzvtjeybq ) . 
  we have karadoc , a knights of the round table , who is known for his inspiring proverb : '' * [ the fat , it 's life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt4kwxsf9yw ) * '' . 
  tu as un super bon niveau !, 
  and always screming your machiavellian plans . 
  you should be more discreet !, 
  you understood it ? 
  because sometimes , even for me , it was incomprehensible : / if you want to improve your french , i will answer you in french and then english  * je ne peut pas parler pour l'ensemble des francais , mais je pense que beaucoup de personnes voient cette proposition de m\u00e9lenchon plut\u00f4t positivement . 
  * i ca n't speak for everybody , but i think a lot of people see this proposition pretty positively . 
  in our mind , this kind of change represent a new start , a breath of fresh air in our politics . 
  that 's why it was often put in place after a big war . 
  we want to rebuild the country on new bases . 
  personnaly , i think that the 5th and the 3th republics have the most interesting constitutions . 
  the 5th constitution will give a lot of power to the president and his government . 
  it 's better in case of national crisis or war for example . 
  a parlement will take decision way slowler , so it would not be effective even though the situation require rapidity . 
  the 3th republic is more interesting in term of representativeness . 
  it gave more power to the gouvernement and the law is voted with more debate etc. . . a lot of people want this republic back . 
  edit : i 'm always really fascinated by the amount of words we have in common ... 
   media less focused on ratings and sensationalism i think we have the same problem here . 
  yeah . 
  we even have a candidate , melenchon , who propose a 6th republic . 
  the majority of our constitutions had been created after a war ( 3th , 4th and 5th republic ) but not by revolution . 
  brazil . 
  there is the esma youtube channel which is pretty interesting . 
  it had been created by students from an art school . 
  there are near 100 videos in this chanel , but here are some examples i like : * [ mau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae2t4utxxpw ) i never wanted so much to punch a cat . 
  * [ the short story of a fox and a mouse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6kcwj0sk4s ) * [ catch it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c88qe6yghfm ) * [ foward march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwqnveqvlyq ) * [ the window ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95kskbqvcws ) * in french but easily understanstable . 
  she asked at the begining to see charly and wanted to go to the `` princess world '' . 
  [ mon ami charly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rknzgtinj1s ), 
  it 's the 4th bigest town of norway . 
  no problem , 
  yep , i bought his cd ( my car radio do n't have usb port ) and i absolutly love all his song . 
  it 's quite sad foreigners will never trully understand all the puns in his lyrics . 
  it 's really clever . 
  what ? 
  it 's not a surprise , napoleon wanted to form a blocus on uk . 
  that 's why he attacked portugal as well . 
  but that was just a bonus reason , the main one was to attract even more polish soldier in his army by defending their country . 
  they already composed most of his foreign army and poland was one of the only country he blindly trusted ( contrary to spain ) . 
   the treaty of sch\u00f6nbrunn , which ended the 1809 war between austria and france , had a clause removing western galicia from austria and annexing it to the grand duchy of warsaw . 
  russia viewed this as against its interests and as a potential launching-point for an invasion of russia . 
  in 1811 ** russian staff developed a plan of offensive war ** , assuming a russian assault on warsaw and on danzig . 
   in an attempt to gain increased support from polish nationalists and patriots , napoleon in his own words termed this war the second polish war . 
  well , if they want to attack our ally ... ( poland was our biggest ally back this time ), 
  i guess [ claudio cap\u00e9o - un homme debout ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9gcm9dzujo ) ( it 's about homeless persons ) and [ stromae - quand c'est ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ajw4chksqm ) ( about cancer ) . 
  the lyrics of stromae are really good in general btw . 
  i also like this song from [ coeur de pirate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwru4we1nq8 ) . 
  * si ton tonton tond ton tonton , ton tonton sera tondu * = if you oncle shave your uncle , your uncle will be shaved . 
  * si ta tata t\u00e2te ta tata , ta tata sera t\u00e2t\u00e9 * = if your aunt palpate your aunt , your aunt will be palpated . 
  my favorite is '' * il ne faut pas pousser m\u00e9m\u00e9 dans les orties * '' which literally mean '' * do n't push granny on the nettles * '' . 
  it means : you must n't go too far , or too fast . 
  take your time and analyse the situation . 
  + * french vanilla : we do n't have vanilla in france ... * french manicure : it 's american * french horn : it 's german * french letter : we say english condom in france , so ... * french press : it 's italian * french cricket : it 's english * french bulldog : it 's english * french disease : it 's spanish, 
  because of that , he lost a lot of men in spain . 
  plus , during the russian campaing , he had to deal with russia and the guerillas from spain . 
  that 's the same kind of war than the algerian or the vietnam one . 
  it 's much harsh on the long term than the usual war . 
  not the best conditions to face russia . 
  and i know the spanish king was n't very trustfull , but causing a coup d'etat was n't a good idea either . 
  a lot of people think the biggest mistake of napoleon was attaking russia in winter . 
  he arrived in russia in june and the main battles happend in august/september . 
  during the attack , the worst in russia was n't the weather , but the scorched earth policy . 
  the war in russia was n't avoidable , while the coup d'etat was our fault . 
  i will say [ annecy ] ( http://www.annecy.com/public/uploads/photo-vieille-ville-annecy.jpg ) ( even though it 's not a small town , but a medium one ) then [ colmar ] ( http://apps.tourisme-alsace.info/photos/colmar/photos/235008803_12.jpg ) and [ sarlat-la-can\u00e9da ] ( https://www.francecomfort.com/cmslib/www.francecomfort.com/francecomfort/omgeving/huge/sarlat_8_plein_terras_restaurant_frankrijk_vakantiepark_francecomfort_villa_zwembad.jpg ), 
  * not participing in the 30 years war and focus on increasing the number of colons in our colonies while the rest of europe was fighting . 
  it would have change the power balance during the 7 years old war later , and maybe even americans would have been speaking french nowodays !, 
  * louis xvi do n't try to run away in austria . 
  that 's what condamned him later . 
  if he have n't done that , france would have been a constitutional monarchy right now . 
  * napoleon not attacking spain . 
  i think this guerilla war is what weakened him the most . 
  the attack of russia was inevitable since they were threatening poland ( as always ) , but the treason behind spain 's back should have been avoid . 
  there was a mcdonald 's machine which did n't work for 6 month in my town , so i went in the other macdonald , even if i had to drive 15 minutes more . 
  i absolutly want my mcflurry daims/caramel . 
  no , we do n't really care about the background of your ethnicity . 
  but you have to share our culture to be considered as french . 
  french comedies in general . 
  they massacred '' [ le dinner de cons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fhlvec3vae ) '' and '' [ les visiteurs ] ( http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=32547.html ) '' , so i guess the movies `` asterix and obelix , mission cl\u00e9opatre '' , `` oss 117 '' or `` la cit\u00e9 de la peur '' would be horrible .
