i 'll have to double-check , but i 'm pretty sure my 3 year old daughter was n't . 
  we lived in the netherlands , and now france , and polio just is n't a thing here . 
  very disturbing news . 
  thank goodness for small favors . 
  on the other flip side , maybe this is a bad thing ? 
  if the nutters managed to form that bloc , maybe those who hold the reins of power would actually sit up and start paying attention to the people instead of each other ? 
  no , who am i kidding ? 
  they 'd toss a few crumbs , we 're gratefully eat them and then wonder why we were forgotten . 
   a decade ago , we had a big scandal over a speeding drunk us marine who killed in a car crash a popular rock singer ( teo peter ) . 
  this soldier was also taken away from romania and cleared of manslaughter charges . 
  [ here 's some unpleasant background on that , courtesy of wikileaks ] ( http://www.nineoclock.ro/wikileaks-disclosures-on-teo-peter-case-stir-controversy/ ), 
  it depends on whether or not the rest of europe balances that out or if the playing field becomes leveled . 
  the only real disadvantage that i can see is if a leveler playing field becomes an excuse to ignore structural issues with the euro ( which i suspect it will ) . 
  having monetary union without fiscal union and no real mechanism to get out is a ticking time bomb for another disaster . 
  it 's like that old saying `` tit for tat '' . 
  what is `` tat '' and how do i trade it in ? 
  in other news , i hope my wife does n't read / r/europe !, 
  and yet so many of my friends back in the us find your accents titillating . 
  it warms the cockles of my heart , it does . 
   this bit of internal political horse trading will drastically increase german demand . 
  can you explain your reasoning ? 
  by pushing wages up by a considerable amount , the price of german exports will rise and that should * decrease * demand . 
  how do you feel it 's going to increase it ? 
  holy crap , this is going to be interesting . 
  first , here 's a tidbit from the article :  job centres in the state of mecklenburg western-pomerania reported office workers receiving $ 1.37 an hour , a delivery driver on $ 1.55 an hour and a receptionist on $ 2.54 an hour . 
  what 's really going to make this interesting is how this will impact exports . 
  many people are concerned that france is struggling because she refuses to adopt strict austerity measures , but they ignore the fact that [ france is doing much better than pundits think ] ( http://www.overseas-exile.com/2013/11/red-state-france-is-doing-fine-thank-you.html ) . 
  however , one obstacle to france getting back on her feet is germany 's wages . 
  here 's the problem . 
  germany exports many goods to foreign countries . 
  however , [ germany pays many workers less than $ 6 an hour , while france has a $ 9.50 minimum wage ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20130915-low-wages-flip-side-booming-german-economy ) . 
  as a result , german export goods are relatively inexpensive and this leads to high demand . 
  what * usually * happens in this high demand scenario is that consumers will then start purchasing large quantities of the exporting nation 's currency to buy that nation 's goods , but this drives up the value of that currency , resulting in the goods costing more . 
  however , much of german 's export market is to other nations on the euro , ensuring that the value of the german currency * ca n't * rise , thus artificially keeping the price of their goods low . 
  if germany adopts a minimum wage that is considerably more than the wages their export-producing workers currently earn , this will drive up the cost of german exports and will give surrounding countries a chance to be more competitive with germany . 
  in the short run , this will help many german workers , but could cause widespread disruptions in the german economy . 
  in the long run , this would be good for europe , but german 's may be upset at a leveled playing field and weaker exports , but it will be hard to roll back a minimum wage once it goes into effect . 
  as i live in france , i 'm very happy to hear that this might happen , but it could be very disruptive while economies adjust . 
  ** update ** : merkel 's in a real bind on this one . 
  with more than 80 % of german 's supporting a minimum wage ( per the article ) , she ca n't really afford to say `` no '' . 
  however , she knows damned well that german 's `` engine of europe '' status is largely due to strong exports . 
  she does n't want to damage that , but if she pitches that the german people , she 's going to piss off hollande and many other european leaders who have long claimed that germany 's low wages are giving them an unfair competitive edge . 
  many government 's try to maintain exports via tariffs to protect domestic industries and subsidies/tax benefits to exporters . 
  this sort of anti-competitive behavior , while understandable , does n't work fly in the eu . 
  thus , germany 's reluctance to tamper with their low wages . 
  i fully expect some work from the merkel administration to try to address this . 
  grab the popcorn !, 
  i 'm a white american living in france . 
  however , i used to live in the uk and many british people , upon hearing my accent , somehow assumed i was just as racist as they were and would go on and on about how immigration was ruining the uk . 
  when i would point out that * i * was an immigrant , the response would invariably be `` you 're the good kind . '',

  and do n't forget that [ prince charles is a homeopathy nutter ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gemma-hurley/prince-charles-and-the-ho_b_2883153.html ) .

  she 's as white as the snow . 
  she lives in sweden with her swedish boyfriend -- who 's black . 
  we have [ chipotle in paris ] ( http://www.chipotle.com/france/fr-fr/default.aspx ) , but taco bell has tried and failed to make an impression on europe . 
  thank you !, 
  i lived in the netherlands for a year and the dutch referred to themselves as `` the other cheese country '' . 
  what i did n't realize at first was that they were referring to quantity , not variety . 
  now i live in france and i ca n't believe some of the strange `` cheese '' my wife brings home to eat . 
  my secret shame : kraft macaroni and cheese . 
  as an american living in europe , i 've had a surprisingly large number of other americans in europe tell me the same damned thing . 
  and fritos . 
  gim me my damned fritos . 
  teach her how to make frito pie . 
  oh , and you probably ca n't bring meat from the us , but it might be funny in a sad sort of way . 
  it was hilarious watching my french wife trying to cook meat in the us . 
  she was horrified when she watched all of the water flooding out of the meat and could n't cook it properly . 
  i had totally forgotten about that and i had to show her how to look for the words `` water added '' on many meat packages . 
  yeah , that does kind of kill the idea . 
  yeah , my wife and i briefly considered monaco because i 'm the breadwinner and i 'm a us citizen , but given that i 'll be picking up french citizenship soon , that sort of wrecked those plans . 
  american living in paris . 
  unfortunately , the `` american sized '' cup o ' coffee ai n't too popular around here . 
  instead , the free coffee we get at work is like the damned pomeranian of coffee and is gone in about two scalding sips . 
  `` ancient shorelines , ice sheets and rivers are approximate '' . 
  why the disclaimer ? 
  are they afraid someone 's going to get lost 20,000 years ago and sue ? 
  i would be happier with it if i saw a very clear explanation of power reserved for the various member states and powers reserved to the eu . 
  for example , in the us , the government has absolute power over interstate commerce , but each state can regulate its commerce as it sees fit ( in theory . 
  in reality , the federal government gets really pissy when the states violate `` moral '' issues such as drinking age laws and the like ) . 
  american living in france , previously lived in the uk for years . 
  every single british person i 've spoken with on the subject who disagrees with the uk being in the eu has the same objection : `` we do n't want bureaucrats from brussels telling us what to do '' . 
  i think much of this is due to deliberately misleading reporting in the daily mail and other anti-eu papers ( though the mail is one of the worst ) . 
  i think a large part of the british public is simply misinformed about what the eu is doing . 
  on the other hand , the eu has done an awful job of communicating what it 's doing and getting things done ( the whole solidarity versus sovereignty debate is causing many issues and not just with the uk ) . 
   i can tell you that , personally , i was never denied any of these opportunities by any of the jobs ive had over the years . 
  i can tell you that personally , i * was * denied those in most of my jobs when i lived in the us . 
  i can also tell you that you have to look at the laws and the data , not your personal anecdotes . 
  hell , i turned down a job as a software engineer at a well-known database consultancy company because they offered no paid vacation , but `` compensating time off '' when you worked overtime . 
  my job before that ? 
  three years as a senior software engineer at a small shop that offered * one week paid vacation per year * . 
  so yeah , we can trade anecdotes , or we can look at the data . 
  i 'm a us citizen , born and raised in the us , so there was nothing unusual about my situation . 
  now i 've lived in five countries -- currently in france -- and i guarantee from personal experience * and * data that they offer far better working conditions than the us ), 
   am i missing something ? 
  let 's look at those points : 1 protection at work . 
   i 'll give you that one , due to osha . 
  i do n't know much about us worker safety standards . 
  2 holidays  [ there 's no legal mandate in the us for paid time off ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyamohn/2013/08/13/paid-time-off-forget-about-it-a-report-looks-at-how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries/ ) . 
  up to a quarter of us workers have no paid time off .
