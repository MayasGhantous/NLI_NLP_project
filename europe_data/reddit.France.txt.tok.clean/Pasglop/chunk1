there 's also new rochelle in the us , founded by hugenots fleeing the wars of religion iirc, 
  we also sometimes say `` casse-toi une jambe '' , litterally `` break a leg '', 
  in guyane , probably . 
  in european france , i would be surprised , except maybe in the mountains somewhere ? 
  this aint gon na end well, 
  yah , i meant shake shack , i could swear there was a & there !, 
  well that certainly describes me and i vote lrem , so you might be right, 
  ( by alphabetical order ) - em ( en marche / forward ) ( also called lrem , rem , rm ... for r\u00e9publique en marche ) : new centrist ( center-right ) party led by macron , socially progressive and economically liberal , currently the ruling party . 
  there are no `` clich\u00e9 '' em supporters atm , because the party is too new to have created many clich\u00e9s . 
  - fi ( france insoumise / unsubmissive france ) : far left ( but not communist ) . 
  economically protectionnist , very keen on ecology , socially progressive . 
  the clich\u00e9 supporter is the `` bobo-gauchiste '' hipster-y student - fn ( front national / national frony ) : far-right party . 
  socially conservative , economically protectionnist . 
  the cilch\u00e9 supporter is either the edgy 18-years-old or the old racist countryside people . 
  - lr ( les r\u00e9publicains / the republicans ) : mainstream right-wing party . 
  socially conservative ( divided on gay marriage ) , economically liberal . 
  known for its corruption . 
  the clich\u00e9 lr supporter is some old catholic dude . 
  - ps ( parti socialiste / socialist party ) : left-wing , once one of the two main parties with lr and now mostly irrelevant . 
  socially progressive and economically * it 's complicated * . 
  no clich\u00e9 supporter since most of them left for em or fi . 
  i do n't believe it 's possible to nail down one absolute `` best french food '' . 
  as a breton , i would say cr\u00eapes and galettes , but probablty only for britanny . 
  someone from savoy or normandy might say cheese , someone from the mediterranean might say fish ... 
  shake & shack !, 
  it 's just too great to be real . 
  i ate at the one on times square , one of the best burgers , fries and lemonades of my life, 
  add the pas de calais to that please, 
  as far as the records went , my ancestors all lived in britanny, 
   the reach : england - house tyrell : the tudors . 
  trigerred, 
  and i heard the same about gen\u00e8ve a couple of times, 
  i almost had a downvote reflex there, 
   england is capital of france fuck you, 
  grind his body in a windmill and use the bones to help tulips grow ? 
  it 's a bit weird , but nothing incredible either, 
  it is a family name here in france !, 
  one of the largest streets in rennes is even called * rue le bastard * ( the bastard street ), 
  i like * dickdoodle fucknugget * , but it is quite situational, 
  or just `` et toi ? '', 
  implying the '' \u00e7a va '', 
  ( i am not the same person ) i 've seen them in a `` traiteur '' shop exactly once , i 'm from britanny, 
  not this again d :, 
  i 'm a student in britanny so ... a lot boy you 're not ready, 
  i 'd say l'enfant roi is the extreme laxist version of not being able to say no to your child . 
  not beating your child would be the norm , although letting them do what they want would imo fall in the enfant roi category, 
  honestly , i think that some of the moderate rightwingers would not have too much of a problem with it . 
  then again , they probably voted macron and not fillon ... 
  wait , balkany was not reelected as d\u00e9put\u00e9 ? 
  yay, 
  the united kingdom ( fite me other frenchmen ! ), 
  anywhere in western europe that is not too far from the sea . 
  i 'd much rather live in stockholm than lyon , for example . 
  if i had to choose a specific country , i would be france ( mainly britanny ) , then ireland probably . 
  as a teenager ( i 'm only 18 ) , i 'd say that my `` timeline '' was roughly the same as yours , although i do n't remember playing outside much ( then again , i 'm very indoorsy ) . 
  like an englishman would know anything about food, 
  i 'm pretty sure people like me whose ancestors all come from small villages in britanny have a rather serious mixup of family members instead , 
   we like speak for yourself . 
  pickes are vile , i do n't know how anyone could eat that, 
   launch italy can into space, 
  also , for politicians jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon is born in tangiers ( morocco ) , jacques cheminade in buenos aires ( argentina ) ( although `` made a name '' is debatable ) . 
  gad elmaleh is from morocco as well , casablanca to be exact , kad merad is from algeria ... on the other hand , although she is not french by any means , and made here career outside of france , emma watson was born in paris !, 
  le fran\u00e7ais pas une langue ~ ~ mainstream ~ ~ courant principal ? 
  i have the regret of not speaking breton ( and anyways it 's ugly ) , but i 'd like to pick up gaelic , wihc on top of beinc celtic sounds nice and is from a nice country !, 
   and the ocean is ~ ~ a bit cold ~ ~ deliciously refreshig ftfy ( for reference , i 'm from britanny ), 
  or saint-etienne ^ ^ or ^ brest, 
  also fran\u00e7ois langley ( langley = l'anglais = from england ), 
  it is not french by origin , but it is very much street food in france, 
  i beat you !, 
  i went to loz\u00e8re once , the least populated d\u00e9partement ( 55 000 inhabitants ) . 
  it 's boring and way too hot in summer, 
  depends on where you are . 
  in upper britanny ( mainly ille-et-vilaine ) it 's mostly flat , whereas in c\u00f4tes-d'armor and finist\u00e8re ( and to a lesser extend morbihan ) it is very hilly . 
  and get sticky caramel goodness all over your fingers . 
  if anything , the `` regions '' are colonizing paris . 
  montparnasse is already a breton protectorate !, 
  it does . 
  for example , in britanny , it might rain once every three days - roughly ) , while it rains once every ten days in provence . 
  only , the rain in provence is much , much strongr than he very light rain in britanny, 
  ite simz la\u00efke oui ave saume da\u00efveurgence in aweur acc\u00ebnte . 
  wa\u00efle iou s\u00e8i `` wive '' , aie am maure incla\u00efnd tou s\u00e8i `` wiz '' . 
  honestly , as a student , i 'd go back to 1966 . 
  that way , i could immerse myself in the 60 's culture and experience mai 68, 
  agreed . 
  i 'd say from around bordeaux more specifically . 
  there 's something i do n't like in the b\u00e9arn and toulouse accents but i ca n't find what, 
  where i live in rennes it was fairly clean ( patton ) , but the filtiest places were the touristy areas ( sainte anne square , the charles de gaulle square and its vicinity ) with the exception of r\u00e9publique square, 
  yeah except rennes and nantes ( it 's in britanny i want to believe ) . 
  they are quite filthy . 
  it really depends on the party imo . 
  the r\u00e9publicains and national front are not very trustworthy , and i could never bring myself to trust m\u00e9lenchon . 
  in the ps , i think hamon for example , has a genuine desire for scoailsit policies for example . 
   i vow to thee my country gives me the chills every time . 
  it was also perfectly rendered in civlization v as england 's theme, 
  we are a bit rough on the edges in britanny . 
  in cities we are like any other french people ( we might drink more ) , but rural breton people are very ... rustic . 
  tips are also generally quite small . 
  i do n't recall seeingany tip being over 5 $ in france, 
  also : lyon : the city of lights ( plural , while it is singluar for paris ) nantes : the city of the dukes of britanny the city of kings : reims and that one city with the story about clovis and some vase : soissons, 
  we have le baron noir too !,
