  it 's a great series , sadly underrated , and is almost the french house of cards , i suggest everyone to check it out !, 
  i 'd say it 's a tie with handball, 
  slander from primitives islanders !, 
  euron 's head should meet a spike !, 
  is there any other caramel ? 
  ya mad or something ? 
  young griff is the only true king !, 
  especially galette-saucisse and cr\u00eapes with caramel !, 
  i 'd also recommend de fun\u00e8s 's movies , especially * la grande vadrouille * , and ont he subject of foreign films : * bye bye lenin *, 
  t'as pas id\u00e9e, 
  arthur was breton and is breton cultural heritage latins get out reeeeeeeeeeeee ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ course, 
  i am a student , still not 20 , and for the first time recently , i 've had a little dipshit call me `` monsieur '' . 
  i felt like i had aged a decade in a second then :(, 
  bless you !, 
  no one cares if you drink a beer in public . 
  why would they ? 
  i feel you oh so much !, 
  yup , * pain au chocolat * is the correct way to write it, 
  of course !, 
  how could i forget it ? 
  you know what 's worse ? 
  people who say * croissant au chocolat * , and those idiots who call an \u00e9clair a ** chocotube ** !, 
  a friggin ' chocotube !, 
  also : - * the mont saint-michel is breton * ( if you talk to a normand ) * / normand * ( if you talk to a breton ) - * what kind of degenerate eats snails , amarite ? 
  * ( not that we do eat snails often , but the stereotype is irking ) - ( to m\u00e9lenchon voters ) * so , why are you voting for a communist ? 
  * - * so , is bouillabaisse good ? 
  * ( to people from the south but not marseille and surroundings . 
  they get incredibly pissed ) - inbreeding jokes in the north and probably many more still, 
  where i live , it would definitely be `` santiano '' ( ca n't link it , i 'm in class right now ), 
  ( lol ), 
   france think germany is their biggest rival !, 
  nah , germans are not really our rivals , we jsut strive to be as good as them . 
  those rosbifs , on the other hand ... 
  eat it with sugar and lemon , chestnut spread or salidou !, 
   also there is arte.tv which levitates above everything else . 
  i concur , arte is damn good and clever . 
  now , it angers me too , but we indeed have an alcohol problem in britanny, 
  just seeing it made my nose itch . 
  not often when i lived in a small town a few years ago , although one of my best friends was mixed , but now that i live in a big city , it 's daily , or almost daily i think . 
  i kinda stopped noticing . 
  the only stima against pirating i 've ever seen was peopel who downloaded independent games , because it impended their growth . 
  i can understand the arguments , after all , 10 $ for them might be a lot , especially compared to ubisoft , 20th century fox and whatnot . 
  # / ! \\ important / ! \\ do not do this in france , you will be asked to speak qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois , say you are an aussie instead !, 
  my city ( rennes ) is between 2000 and 2100 years old ( it was named condate back then ) . 
  by contrast , the building i live in is 6 months old, 
  yes, 
  or maybe germany ? 
  that said , italy could do it too ... or even spain ? 
  we just hate everyone okay ? 
   different way to spell `` czech '' `` tch\u00e8que '', 
  huh . 
  i 've never met french people who did n't know `` pays-bas '' ( but if you say netherlands in english , it might get you some confused looks ), 
  yeah but the other leader is a bishop : /, 
  well then by monaco because why the fuck not, 
  the polish is something like `` shish '' right ? 
  from what i remember fo my short stay in poland , bydgoszcz would be pronounced something like `` b\u00e9dgochich '' in french . 
  americans with french names also have this , the main example is shia labeouf , which is just a weird way of spelling leboeuf, 
  ho boy , mt father has cherry eau-de-vie which was made by my great-great grandfather . 
  i only saw it opened once , for my 18th birthday . 
  i legit got drunk from one shot only, 
  \u00cele-de-france , the region around paris, 
  oh god , i did n't eat maronsuis for a few years , definitley gon na buy me some at carrefour today . 
  that 's absolutely priceless . 
  if le pen did an ama on r/france , we would probably tear her a new one, 
  yep , it makes for a nice morning jog . 
  buy some croissants and/or main au chocolat with it , and down it with homemade orange juice !, 
  speak for yourself, 
  it 's only fair after all !, 
  as a matter of fact , we do n't, 
  maybe tempus comes from greek ? 
  it just comes from greek , simple as tat . 
  we have the same in french : `` temps '', 
   il faut que j' aille au cin\u00e9ma = it falls that i go to the cinema . 
  nope . 
  to fall is `` tomber '' , `` chuter '' or `` choir '' . 
  `` il faut que j' aille au cin\u00e9ma '' is `` it needs that i go to the cinema . '', 
  falloir is tricky because it is only in the third singular person . 
  it 's funny because we have a better army than the teutons, 
  my favorite pologneboule ever . 
  it is jsut so great . 
  in a sense , i am happy that we are the eternal rivals of the british . 
  it is essentially lighthearted fun , and makes any metting with british people a fun and memorable moment . 
  it was last year when i was still in high school , we learned about the second gulf war . 
  i woudl n't be surprised if my little brother studied obama when he will be in terminale . 
  20 $ / month for the fiber , with a speed of about 200mbs in theory . 
  when the internet does no crash , i 'm at about 170 , which is still pretty fucking great , but thanks to the total ineptitude of sfr , i can have up to one day without internet a week pretty easily . 
  also , there is `` go buy a rope , i can lend you a stool '', 
  that 's nothing . 
  when i was in middle school , our teacher wanted to make us sing the chorus of `` we will rock you '' , and i was all '' oui ouais rock you '' , because i thought taht `` oui ouais '' were lieks ome sot of `` yeah yeah '', 
  and it 's so fucking overpriced , just looking at the price tags made me feel i was being robbed . 
  judo ( we got the only 12th dan judoka outside of japan iirc ) , as well as fencing and handball . 
  hey , you have the neuschwanstein !, 
  imo it 's the most beautiful building in europe , or even the world . 
  visited it last year , the carving patterns on the walls are unlike anything i 've ever seen , it 's absolutely breathtaking, 
  in the back rows of the amphiteater , it is easier to masquerade white-and-blue reddit as a serious thing than google images with pictures of castles . 
  ( and the weird looks would have been from classmates , there is no way that the teacher , from 20 meters away and 10 meters down would see my screen ), 
   le hutin means more like `` the enraged one '' rereading `` the accursed kings '' , it 's a bit of both  philippe v was the long ? 
  oops !, 
  `` the fair '' one was his little brother charles iv !, 
  thank you !,
