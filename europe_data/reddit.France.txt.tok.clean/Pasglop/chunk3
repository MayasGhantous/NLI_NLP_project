  thank you . 
  i am in class and could n't go to google images without getting soem weird looks, 
  i 'll be honest , gustav ii adolf and carl xii are the only ones i know , thanks to civ v and sabaton respectively, 
  stricto sensu , we could say that cdg is indeed the father of the fifth french republic , which is the current iteration of france . 
  he may not be the father of the nation , but he definitely is the father of the republic imo, 
  still better than the endless `` hurr durr surrender monkeys '' joke, 
  i 'd say one of the loire castles , probably chambord or chenonceau . 
  we also had louis x the `` hutin '' , which means `` idiot '' , and ~ ~ philippe v ~ ~ charles iv the fair , son of philippe iv the fair . 
  althoug philippe iv was indeed eye-pleasing , it was pure mockery for ~ ~ philippe v ~ ~ charles iv , who was ugly as fuck . 
  i am in sciences po , which means i study history , economics , sociology , foreign languages and law , mostly . 
  wake up at 7am , take a shower , quckly eat a bowl of cereal , wash my teeth , put my computer in my bag . 
  leave between 7:45 and 7:50 , walk 10 minutes to college , get into class . 
  at midday , i go eating in a small tartines restaurant down the street from where i study . 
  at 1:45 pm , get back to class ( if it is a monday , tuesday or wednesday ) , or go to the university library ( on thursdays and fridays ) . 
  work until 4 or 6 pm , then go back to my apartment . 
  there i work until 8 pm , and i eat some microwaved dish while watching something on netflix . 
  i usually get back to wrk at 9 pm for an hour . 
  from 10 to 11:30 i play videogames , and then i go to sleep . 
  rinse and rpepat, 
  but they were loud after the euro, 
  dudeis so metal , he not only eats animals , he also * drinks * animals, 
  feum , the verlan of a verlan word ... 
  there 's `` dar '' too , whic is the verlan of the english word `` rad '' , and pretty much means the same thing, 
  pizza pizza pizza !, 
  there is not really a `` drinking age '' , but y are not allowed to buy until you are 18 ( everyone ignores it ), 
  woaw , you managed to cite the two french dishes i hate the most \\ ^ \\ ^ !, 
  to me , it is the [ tarte flamb\u00e9e / flammenkueche ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarte_flamb%c3%a9e ) , a traditional alsacian dish, 
  also : a slice of tomme de savoie in a homemade hamburger goat cheese in some kinds of soup camembert melted into an oven even if it is very plain , a good emmental can be an awesome quick meal ... 
   cheese  cheddar choose one, 
  and i thought german people were n't funny , you proved me wrong, 
  well , i said the best is in saint brieuc . 
  it is alright in rennes , quiberon , brest and vannes too ( all cities i lived in for some time ) . 
  and all those cities make up most of the breton population , so i guess most of us have it good ? 
   especially the bretons never seen someone with an hermine tatoo . 
  but one thing that is true is that iv ' e seen more tatooed people in britanny than elsewhere, 
   brita dunno what you 're talking about . 
  i never drak tap water as good as in saint-brieuc ( tastes better than bottled water ), 
  can comfirm , am super nice, 
  fortunately , northern britanny ( or at least the penthi\u00e8vre ) is way too fucking cold and windy to attract that much tourists , an we do n't have touristic spots like quiberon . 
  and djoul and black m, 
  not from my country but from my region ( britanny ) : we generally do n't like nolwenn leroy . 
  she is just too clich\u00e9 , singing ( and sometimes not even that good ) old breton songs with a biniou/bombarde and whatnot orchestra behind . 
  in this case , the `` breton was a peasant 's language '' happened during the third republic ( 1870-1940 ) , when the politicians wanted to make france very homogenic . 
  they made sure every child was learning french , the history of france ... breton , occitan , corsican and manymore regional languages were forbidden . 
  two men are sitting on a bench . 
  one is drunk , the other one is breton too . 
  hijacking your comment for britanny ( for thos who do n't know , a region in western france with a rpetty distinct culture ) : i 'd say [ galettes ] ( https://files.meilleurduchef.com/mdc/photo/recette/galette-bretonne/galette-bretonne-640.jpg ) , stuffed with ham , cheese , eggs and onions , and [ kouign amann ] ( http://p6.storage.canalblog.com/63/34/957661/87547255_o.jpg ) , a butter cake . 
  uuuugh , they are the worst , all smug and slow when i 'm trying to get somewhere ... really , i 'm happy that britanny is underrated , it means we get less obnoxious tourists compared to paris or the mediterranean . 
  jesus christ those comments under the video gave me cancer ... 
  if it was strictly got-esque ( so like `` flowers '' , `` stone '' , `` snow '' ... ) , it would probably be something like `` grape '' or `` rivers '' ( `` raisin '' and `` rivi\u00e8re '' in french ) . 
  if we go by the common names route , it would probably be `` dupont '' ( of the bridge ), 
  i 'd add france inter ( even if it is to the left ) and courrier international, 
  also , for the younger generation ( like me or my little borthers ) there are all the claude ponti books ( georges lebanc , all the stories about the poussins , ma vall\u00e9e ... ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbhetvpsqlo for britanny in france, 
  could not have said it better, 
  ah shoot , i deleted the mp he sent me , i knew it would come in handy some day . 
  i think he 's danish , but i might be mistaken ? 
  also , most of the time , he pms people , never voices his disapproval in comments . 
  you 'd have to alter your grammar to an american one to catch him . 
   there 's a really reeeally salty guy on here who reports every post which has `` americanized '' grammar . 
  pack it in \u0ca0_\u0ca0 one time i wrote `` color '' . 
  he almost sent me a death threat via pm . 
  edit : i forgot how to anglais, 
  what about wakfu ? 
  i am shocked that no one ( especially from france ) has said wakfu yet . 
  and that 's why i 'm appy that in france , we only have a distinction between male and female in singular `` le/la '' , while in plural it 's the neutral `` les '' , so we avoind this controversy, 
  nope , it 's en marche !, 
  algeria , msot specifically because of its war of independence , which made the fourth republic fall and put de gaulle in charge , shaping france as we know it, 
  well , the fact that it did n't exist a few months ago is one, 
  also the belle epoque , from 1900 to 1914 , when france was arguably as powerful as great britain , and the cultural center of the world, 
   he 's hardly pro-abortion , but he is pro-choice and would n't touch abortion laws . 
  yeah , it 's more like that . 
   being anti-abortion should be political suicide here , i hope . 
  i mean , i guess there 's marion mlp ... 
  it is , except , as you said , for the far-right of the far-right , wich are nutjobs enough to refute it . 
  did n't you kinda overthrew the king because he did n't want to sign the law , then put him back in charge ? 
  well , abortion is very free here , and not very contested . 
  ususally , it is only the far-right , and not even all of them , that protest against abortion . 
  even the very conservative fillon ( right-wing candidate to the election ) is pro-abortion . 
   double names for girls , particularly with a french part : upper class ( marie-fleur , marie-louise ) it 's the same in france , with maybe the exception of anne-marie which is more of a grandma 's name . 
  you should what the series `` the expanse '' ! , hard sci-fi , with a police subplot . 
  pute ( french ) puta ( spanish , maybe portuguese and italian too ? ), 
  whore ( english ) kurwa ( polish ) cyka ( russian ) shei\u00dfe ( german ) yeah i 'm not proud, 
  this is the most russian thing i 've seen . 
  meh , not very common, 
  triggered, 
  this man speaks the truth !, 
  also : in french , a `` bougette '' was a side bag . 
  it translated to `` budget '' into english where it became the bag of tax collectors , then lost the sense of a bag to become something regarding money balance , and came back to french to become `` budget '', 
  i 've seen a fran\u00e7ois-marie once ( he went by fran\u00e7ois only ), 
  because some people indeed eat frogs ( eugh ), 
  well , the spanish r is more a rolled r or a l ( at least that 's what my spanish teacher , native from spain , told me ) , whereas the french r is more like a spanish ( from spain , not latin america ) j, 
  truly , eurovision is the pinnacle of human evolution . 
  ave ? 
  ( did i do that right ? ), 
  well , i still think french pizza is better than italian pizza ( also , france actually has the highest pizza consumption per capita in europe ) , but really , that 's very clich\u00e9 of a thing to say about a cuisine as rich as italy 's, 
  no problem !, 
  but are n't there famous manuscript from medieval burgundy , or the general historical region of belgium ? 
  what you said !, 
  was n't he french ?
