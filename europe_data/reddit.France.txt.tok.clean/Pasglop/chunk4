  i mean , troyes is in champagne , not far from reims where the french kings were crowned . 
   are being fed up a new president every five years yeah that 's called elections \\ ^ ^, 
  naaah , a true frenc accent would be `` ee-ou av tou kutte ze pa ** rrr ** t '' with a very strong french `` r '' , like a spanish `` j '' or german `` ch '', 
  we like you too , your cuisine is wonderful ( and i confess , at least equal to ours , maybe even better ), 
  a few times it is german , such as in a futurama episode where french is a dead language . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm on board with that ... ( wait , did he say lorraine , not alsace ? ), 
  go on , take it !, 
  i would be british so oh hell no, 
  what was it about ? 
  f\u00e9lix faure died like i want to die ... old , rich , famous , and his dick in the mouth of a pretty girl . 
  oh god , wallonian sounds weiiiiiird, 
  that last one is so hardcore . 
  you apparently did n't see my flair , because you bothered with a translation , 
  nah , if anything trump is more liek a mix of cheminade and asselineau ( which luckily are both irrelevant ), 
  as much as i disagree with his politics , chirac was always a trat to watch !, 
  http://cabinflooresoterica.com/images/rennes/rennes-02.jpg because in rennes , we are so drunk all the time that it even affects the buildings , they ca n't stand straight . 
  edit : http://www.tourismebretagne.com/var/crtbre/storage/images/media/images/decouvrir/emblematiques/rennes/rennes_place_du_parlement/496016-1-fre-fr/rennes_place_du_parlement_large_rwd.jpg also , the parlement de bretagne , with its two sotries not the same color ( the top burned during the 90 's ), 
  i 've only got the french flag because there 's no breton one , so you 'd better prepare for haesteinn of nantes !, 
  mostl , it is because the clich\u00e9d british accent when speaking french and the real british accent when speaking french are completely differend , and the second one sounds a bit like a clich\u00e9d german accent sometimes, 
  we really need to repare this leak before the deus vult leaks too . 
  it feels like a betrayal but ... 
  i actually agree with you, 
  fucking nailed it . 
  the perfidious albion !, 
  well there 's football, 
  considering its position near the leftist stronghold that is britanny , and the general french attitude about trump , which is a mix of disgust , disdain , incredulity and fear , probably arond 90 % -10 % for hillary, 
  absolutely haram, 
  in french , bohemian means `` gypsy '' , and `` la vie de boh\u00eame '' is the phrase dor a poor life . 
  get ready for the stereotypes !, 
  there is edmond in french, 
  not really , most breton names are distinct : gwen , tugdual , gweltas ... 
  yah , you got a point . 
  frnace is historically catholic , and yet the most ( or maybe second most ) atheist country in europe , with more than half the population being nonbeleivers . 
  it 's just a big , big room , with waaay too many locks on the door . 
  but us ? 
  how can you forget the oldest rivalry in history ? 
  we are nothing without eachother !, 
  to me , the dems would be center , center left . 
  they are economically liberal , but very progressive socially , while the republicans would rank between `` hard '' right , as we call it in frnace ( socially conservative , ultraliberal , \u00e0 la thatcher , reagan or fillon ) , to the outright fascist . 
  really , i think that in europe , the republicans would be categorized as far-right , even further than front national , for example . 
  but they killed the v\u00e9n\u00e8tes !, 
  i say celtic france ftw . 
  i do n't know about other languages , but in french , `` bretagne '' , is both the word for britain and britanny , a region of france . 
  as a result , we often say grande-bretagne , streesing the `` grande '' , to be sure we do n't talk about `` petite '' bretagne, 
  nope , hollandais is for the people of hollande ( like breton for the people of britanny ) , and n\u00e9erlandais for the people and language of the netherlands ( like fran\u00e7ais is both the language and people of france ) . 
  why are you only targeting females ? 
  ( just joking , i believe you meant `` parisians '' , `` parisiennes '' is specifically the women living in paris ), 
  ally with germany , defeat lux , belgium , iltaly and switzerland pretty easily , m\u00f4aco and andorra immediatly surrender , we invade spain after along war ( and possibly nuke madrid ) , and then we take on the perfidious albion, 
  alexandre dumas , basically the first commercial author ever , he wrote ( among other things ) two books which have cult status in france : * the three musketeers * and * the count of monte-cristo * ( which is the best book ever , by the way ), 
  nope , we got everything : likd it hot ? 
  bordeaux . 
  hotter ? 
  marseille . 
  cold ? 
  colder ? 
  mild ? 
  milder ? 
  rainier ? 
  dry ? 
  dryer ? 
  nice . 
  mountainous ? 
  grenoble . 
  more ? 
  i can name one : jacques cheminade 2017, 
  bruh he will say all europeans are gunless cucks anyway, 
   standing in the way of corsican independence is not a smart move . 
  well , someone has to bail the island out at some point  i do n't see the issue me neither  though i suspect danes or swedes are more likely to annex normandy . 
  naah , if anything , the normands are as annoying as the enlgish , from my point of view . 
  they will fit nicely . 
  france and poland srround germany too . 
  besides , the last time the germans tried to unite all coutries bordering them in one countries , it did not end that well . 
  hum hum . 
  breton law should be french mate . 
  yours is briton law . 
   independent normandy . 
   independent brittany . 
  immediately , corsica is sold to itlay , while britanny entres into a war with normandy about mont saint michel , which is their rightful territory . 
  both are ruined . 
  britanny is annexed in ireland ( celtic union ftw ) , while the british annex normandy for old time 's sake . 
   celtic people group join ireland then, 
  pretty uncommon , most people have a standard frnehc accent ( i think it is from tours ) . 
  the exception being some experts on the tv and some politicans having a marseille accent . 
  thar really whiny and nasal accent from some parisian upper class people tho ... `` hon ouaaaiiis tu vois ... '', 
  brb gon na steal a nice italian lady . 
  brest as well , for the same reasons as le havre . 
  aaah , the best comedic movie ever !, 
  that would work in french too !, 
  you heretic . 
  thermomix changed my life : it makes cooking everything so easy ( sure , their marketing system looks a bit pyramid-schemy , but the product is worth it ), 
  and to think the japanese bathe in it ... 
  a german watching poland turning int an authoritarian state ... ze tablez have turned, 
  we do not really have one big problem , more like many instances of people clashing with migrants , fueling the anger of the fn ? 
  whoc rafted the narrrative of immigration being the problem . 
   really ? 
  i mean , spanish has th and kh sounds , neither catalan or portuguese have them . 
  catalan and portuguese have sh and zh sounds . 
  spanish does n't . 
  catalan and portuguese weaken non tonic ( stressed ) vowels ( a little bit like french does ) , spanish does n't . 
  yeah , but what i tried to say is that although i understand spanish to an extent , i can not tell apart catalanand portuguese,
