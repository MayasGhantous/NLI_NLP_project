   the british have never formally invaded mexico but the french totally did !, 
  suck it britain !, 
  :p but yeah , it still show how far their hard power could reach : virtually anywhere on the globe . 
  `` the only other nation which has achieved anything approaching the british total , mr laycock said , is france '' uh uh :3 let 's take `` invaded '' with a grain of salt , though :  incursions by british pirates , privateers or armed explorers have also been included , provided they were operating with the approval of their government . 
  so , many countries which once formed part of the spanish empire and seem to have little historical connection with the uk , such as costa rica , ecuador and el salvador , make the list because of the repeated raids they suffered from state-sanctioned british sailors . 
  cheapest offer by far in france , quite recent since free broke the prices : for 2 euros , unlimited texts , 120 minutes and 50 mb of data . 
  pretty satisfied of it , but if you want more data , it 's going to cost much more . 
  yeah , but for that you 'll need a strong probability of france and the uk giving up the nuclear program . 
  plus , the other countries would then ask for a shared control of the nuclear program , if they are going to share the cost . 
  i do n't think that either of our countries are ready to give up this tool and symbol of sovereignty . 
  hum , i think that european and american geostrategical , diplomatical and economical interests are not always the same . 
  hence an european sovereignty needing an independant operative military . 
  well , they could ask , but the others members are not gon na have the slightest reaction . 
  actually , france is trying to ask for at least a financial support from the eu members when doing military operation such as the ones in mali and car . 
  not much success . 
  `` france ; sweden - 15/11/14 french plane intercepted `` several kilometres '' inside swedish airspace . 
  the swedes scrambled expecting to intercept a russian aircraft . '', 
  ooops . 
  i think the us will always keep nato . 
  it 's a wonderful tool to center the european military capacities around theirs , and to have a really big diplomatical weight in europe . 
  what is possible , though , is europe creating an alliance of its own ( and making nato less and less relevant in europe ) . 
  and yeah , in this case we 'll need at least one nation with a nuclear deterrent . 
  france is higher on the list that great britain . 
  everything else is either semantics or pesky common sense . 
  and meanwhile , in france , the ( rarely ) debated question is rather : should we keep or not the aerian vector ? 
  i think that de gaulle would raise from the dead and strangle the first president trying to give up our nuclear deterrent ... 
  fear us and our superior cars !, 
  it is a fair point . 
  but honestly , imagine if putin was the one who ordered this , and managed to make this seems like a false flag attack , what a message it sends to any people opposing him : not only will you pay dearly your opposition , but it will be completely useless and even your possible open assassination will let most people clearly indifferent and thinking it 's a manipulation . 
  i do n't say it 's necesssarily the case ( mafia and overzealous putin-followers are possible pists , too ) , but i think it 's an advantage for the kremlin that is worth considering . 
  first thing i do with a list like this - see if france ranked higher than the uk . 
  in this case , suck it britain !, 
  hum , `` routinely '' seems quite exagerated . 
  sources ? 
  yeah but to be fair , the foreign policies of the kingdom of france had a lot to do with the division of the territories at the east of france . 
  to divide , neutralize any united threat at the east , culturally influence and slowly absorb the closest territories was the long-term strategy . 
  and pretty well done , when you see what a threat a united and hostile germany can represent for france . 
  but do n't worry , we 're at this point of economical interwinements where any political power on one side of the rhine is compelled to have good relations with its equivalent on the other side . 
  and erasmus students and people taking a job in the other country are a good way to garantee a close relationship , whatever the party in charge is , 
  yeah , but france and england were already nation-states back then ( possibly the oldest of europe , at least western europe ) , whereas defining the shape of `` germany '' is quite difficult . 
  it was more a collection of territories at the east that we kept as divided as possible . 
  i personnally never thought of the house of habsbourg as `` germans '' , and france 's conflict with them as a conflict against `` germany '' . 
  plus , these conflicts were relatively limited to europe ( outside of the xxe century , obviously ) , while france and england 's rivalry spanned africa , america and asia . 
  can you devellop ? 
  but seriously , disolving the baas party ( the only thing holding this country together beyond the communautarism ) and the army ( sending away hundreds of thousands of people with their weapons ) was really stupid and asking for trouble . 
  and of course the grabbing of irak 's ressources by american interests . 
  and the changes of policies support sunni/supporting shiis . 
  let 's be honest , both the real motivations and the execution of the `` let 's bring democracy '' are quite wanting . 
  ask yourself the question : if in 2003 , just before irak 's invasion ( or at the start of it ) , some terrorist bombed the white house and perhaps killed bush , would it makes the situation better ? 
  or would it blinds americans further and makes them support stupid decisions while under anger and fear ? 
  openly killing a country 's leader , except perhaps if he is completely despised and is the only thing holding its regime together against an organised and united opposition having the support of the population , is not a good way to avoid a war , really . 
  it has been pointed out multiple times here , but i 'll do it one more time : a nation 's sovereign airspace is not the same thing that its `` controlled airspace '' . 
  if any country want , it can send planes in this space without asking permission . 
  it 's just that not activating the signal for the civil controlers is a bit risky in a frequented area , and kind of a diplomatic provocation . 
  but it is not illegal , and in no way an act of war . 
  and even if a russian plane entered the sovereign airspace , there is other means to retaliate that firing upon one of the biggest army in the world and taking three more steps toward world war three . 
  sure , perhaps not as instantly satisfying , but you do n't put life of millions in the balance just for a good feeling in the gut for ten seconds .

  we were part of nato . 
  we never left it . 
  we left nato 's integrated command structure . 
  we got back in it in 2009 , with a clause preserving the sovereign use and gestion of our nuclear deterrent . 
  when the merovingians established control on the gauls severals codes of law were exercised , but not depending on the locations but depending on the people you belonged to . 
  there was definitely disparities between different regions ( and south/north ) , but saying north = franks and south = french seems to me like a nonsense . 
  this french/frank distinction is really weird , considering that franks and gallo-romans had the time of blending together during the merovingians . 
  fuck you , uk !, 
  we 'll get you next time !, 
  i 'm not sure why an elected president would have best odds solving this problem than a constitutionnal monarch . 
  if anything the king 's neutrality make him a far better arbiter in such situations . 
  you never have enough relevancy . 
  never !, 
  i 'm not sure the operational difference will really matter . 
  the political move and its meaning for the japanese-australian partnership is the reason it was pushed by the us , that and pleasing the japanese , i think .

  well the big majority of the aerian incidents rencently with russian planes are n't about planes entering territorial airspace but about them entering airspace monitored/controlled by other countries with big plane frequentation ( which the russians absolutely have the right to do ) without signaling themselves ( which they also have the right to do , but which is considered impolite/a provocation and in some case dangerous ) [ the airspace regulations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airspace ) can be [ a bit complex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airspace_class ), 
  it 's as satisfiying as it is undeserved xd,

  * quickly put a flag * we claimed it first , albion !, 
  okay ... first : china and france were n't part of the budapest memorandum . 
  [ they each made separate , somewhat weaker pledges . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_ukraine#budapest_memorandum ) second : [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) [ can ] ( http://www.cfr.org/nonproliferation-arms-control-and-disarmament/budapest-memorandums-security-assurances-1994/p32484 ) [ verify ] ( https://www.msz.gov.pl/en/p/wiedenobwe_at_s_en/news/memorandum_on_security_assurances_in_connection_with_ukraine_s_accession_to_the_treaty_on_the_npt?printmode=true ) . 
  the russian federation , the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and the united states of america reaffirm their commitment to ukraine , in accordance with the principles of the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe , to ** respect ** [ emphasis mine ] the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of ukraine ; the key word here is * respect * . 
  it 's a completely different diplomatical term from * protect * . 
  none of the signatory ever pledged to * protect * ukraine , just to * respect * its sovereignty and not attack it . 
  not the most up to date tank , but neither are all the russian tanks . 
  but yes , nobody want such a big war . 
  no , they did n't promise to protect . 
  each just promised to not attack ukraine . 
  so , russia aside , they all respected the non-agression treaty that was the budapest memorandum .
