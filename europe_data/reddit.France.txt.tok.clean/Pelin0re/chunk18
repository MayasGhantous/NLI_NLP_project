  the west did n't unilaterally lift the sanctions , and iran did n't fill the heart of arak 's reactor with concrete just because they felt like it . 
  the sanctions did push iran to negociate and make concessions ( perhaps temporary , we 'll see and nations are closely watching this ) on its nuclear ambitions . 
  either he 'll have the army on his side , and then it 's not a few guns who will stop him , or he does n't and he can not do much/establish a dictatorship . 
  you either trust your democratic institutions ( the army in particular ) or you undermine their authorities and up the homicide/firearm accidents rate . 
  ~ ~ to keep the british out ~ ~ rural hunting , i 'd say . 
  though the data on this map appear to not be extremely reliable . 
  well , sanctions can work ( iran is a recent good exemple ) , but only if the government care for the nation 's well-being more than whatever the sanctions are trying to impose them , or if the people have a strong capacity to influence the government . 
  if that 's not the case , then the only benefit is to reduce its geopolitical weight/military means . 
  why the grudge ? 
  because we split up the hungarian-austrian empire ? 
  well , they have the advantage of not having a strong left-wing opposition , role that they played when the right was governing . 
  in europe : ottomans were at last killed off by byzantium , and hungary saw its fortune go down as quickly as it had went up . 
  dakarans will probably explains much better than me , and i did n't see/understood much of what happened in europe , because i had much to do with the country i picked for my first session : hindustan , on which i can do you a recap . 
  welcome to india , wonderful land of coalitions , rebellions and italian greed !, 
  so , as soon as i started i got attacked by italy . 
  then a coalition of basically all my non-vassal neighbors attack me ( apparently the previous player had quite an agressive foreign policy ) . 
  i try to fight off the two opponents but my eyes bleed of all the bordergore and my difficulties to recognise which armies/territories are against me and which are my vassals . 
  unable to face both threats and in particular the feared italian army , i make peace with italy , giving up chunks of my vassals in the deal . 
  then it 's a long process to fight the coalised , who are basically on two fronts and come through my territory each time i try to siege one . 
  at the same time , i must face regular and serious rebellions trhough my empire . 
  the reason ? 
  ( it was at 1/4 when i started ) . 
  in the end the war turn at my advantage and i make peace ( do n't remember if i took some territory . 
  i suppose ) . 
  i crush the rebbellions and can at last breath . 
  but not for long , oh no . 
  at the second session mongolia , now player-controled , support the independance of my vassals , and war irrupt again in hindustan . 
  getting a bit sick of it , my economy in debts and rebellions still here , i make peace with mongolia and give up all the himalayas in the process . 
  then i can turn my wrath on my rebellious vassals , beat them into submission at last , and take several of their provinces as compensation . 
  after that , hindustan enjoy for the last years a well-deserved rest , achieve its westernisation and pay back its loans . 
  i wo n't be able to join this time , so i leave hindustan in the hands of the next willing player . 
  it 's perhaps shrunk a bit , but it 's fully westernised and economically healthier that when i took it , despite the plotting and violence of my neighbors , my vassals and the reactionnary elements of my people . 
  `` forced ? '', 
  if he did n't stop the sale it would have been done relatively quietly , and no nation would have done any retribution , as the sanctions were n't retroactive . 
  once he interrupted it and tried to use it as a bargain chip , the international attention made it more delicate . 
  could still have achieved the sale if he really wanted , though . 
  damned if you , damned if you do n't ... 
  * 4ringcircus uses butthurt on pelin0re * * it 's super effective !, 
  ... hence the `` multi '', 
  [ if it helps you sleep at night ... ] ( http://imgur.com/pkp9ikb ), 
  frenchnesse oblige . 
  still , it would not have been possible without the help of this brave canadian , who is probably an undercover quebecois . 
  multi-pleonasm here . 
  no need to excuse yourself , it 's not your fault you were born british . 
  oh , `` propaganda '' was certainly used to form the nation and consolide the state . 
  rulers and partisans of a strong nation have always used cultural means , `` medias '' to establish a `` national roman '' , a legitimisation that transcend the strenght of their army . 
  looking at france , we 've got a good exemple since the start of the capetian dynasty with the alliance with the saint denis abbaye , a cultural powerhouse ( and kind of a `` media '' , however anachronic the term is ) . 
  the 19th century is a much more obvious of the construction of a nation roman , with the help of historians and writers . 
  la firi sera compos\u00e9e de forces sp\u00e9ciales , d'un groupement terrestre interames de 1500 hommes \u00e9quip\u00e9s d'engins blind\u00e9s , d'h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res , d'un groupe naval constitu\u00e9 autour d'un b\u00e2timent de projection et de commandement , de 10 avions de chasse , d'avions de transport tactique , de patrouille maritime et de ravitaillement en vol , et des moyens de commandement et de contr\u00f4le associ\u00e9s so : 5000 men kept ready in permanence , giving the capacity to project 2300 men ( in a polyvalent force including special forces , 1500 soldiers with armored vehicles , helicopters , a mistral , 10 fighters , logistical planes , and a commanding structure ) , within a week , in a 3000 kms radius from the national territory ( or an `` implantation \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger '' , i suppose it means a french base , like the one we have in tchad for exempe ) . 
  so yeah , from the european state which is supposed to have by far the best power projection with the uk , it 's quite worrying for european capacities . 
  on the other hand , it is to relativise , because : 1 ) in case of * real * emergency , like `` shit shit shit the russians are attacking us ! '', 
  rather than `` okay , let 's stop these guys in africa '' i suppose it should be possible to hugely increase the manpower even if it mess with the training/operation/rest rotation and the defense budget . 
  france * livre blanc * allow for a force of 15000 men projectable on a limited period , but if the situation is really dire , the maximum capacity is probably much higher . 
  2 ) if russia attack a nato eastern european country , we have a direct land connection across friendly territory with very good infrastructures . 
  so logistically speaking it is much easier that to send men in mali ( which is i think a good exemple of the scenarii corresponding to this procedure ) . 
  i 'd expect the 2300 men to be there in 2-3 days , and bigger reinforcements to be able to follow quickly . 
  3 ) we 're speaking here of a `` caught with our pants down '' scenario . 
  if the agression is big enough to overwhelm quick reaction forces , one can think that military intelligence would have detected the preparation , and i am not even speaking of political tensions normally anticipating such a big agression . 
  in such a case , plans would have been done , logistic relatively planed and reaction time to this specific scenario considerably decreased . 
  yeah , bought a game and was able to join the chat . 
  thanks . 
  well , i did buy eu4 , but i bought it on instant gaming then activated on steam . 
  ca n't add a friend either , for the same reason . 
   there are games that cost literally 5 cents there exemples ? 
  i 'll be able to participate this time . 
  thing is , i 'm in the group but can not join the chat : steam tells me that my account does n't fullfill the requested conditions to do that . 
  any idea on how to solve the problem ? 
  if france is on your side , do n't he have much more manpower than the neighboring hre members ? 
  why your side did n't stomp them ? 
  western hre do seems like a relatively tender place where there is n't any big power other than france ( and prussia , if the two big alliances clash against each other , which happened once this session ) , yet france 's continental expansion seems extremely slow , in particular when comparing to prussia , lithuania and hungary . 
  some explanation ? 
  * only paris is worthy of rome ; only rome is worthy of paris . 
  done some research [ ( source in french ) ] ( http://www.lepetitjournal.com/varsovie/actu-varsovie/73398-de-gaulle-en-pologne-les-liens-privilegies-et-meconnus-entre-ce-grand-pays-et-le-grand-charles.html ) and yeah , he indeed spent ( after personnal demand ) eighteen months in poland as military advisor and counsellor for the polish army and participating in an important counter-offensive ( gaining some polish decoration , the virtuti military ) . 
  also he apparently was quite popular when he went in poland in 1967 because at the end of ww2 he was one of the rare western leaders to refuse to recognise the regime installed by stalin . 
  [ some words of the general during his polish trip ] ( https://www.ina.fr/video/i00014611 ), 
  it 's the reason , the cause of patriotism . 
  rejecting patriotism , it 's denying/neglecting this need . 
  i think that you and i have different definitions of patriotism , but when debating with others people must either use the consensual definition ( here `` patriotism is an emotional attachment to a nation which an individual recognizes as their homeland '' ) or at the very least , once the confusion understood , establish the meaning they put behind the words they use to continue the discussion . 
  of course , and it is a lesson that we must cherish especially as it costed us so much lives to learn it . 
  but it is a universal truth that excess tend to have bad consequences , be it work , hobbies , wine , desire or patriotism . 
  does it mean that we should back off from all those things ? 
  no , there is no easy way out , no way to garantee peace by neglecting the human need to be part of a community . 
  we can but embrace it while remembering the past and staying vigilant . 
  at 0:56 , statue of charles de gaulle spotted . 
  did not expect it . 
  well , of course words are but tools and we all have slightly differents perceptions/definitions of each words , but to avoid confusion it is generally agreed to try to use the most uniformous/consensual/accurate definition possible . 
  in this case , looking on [ wikip\u00e9dia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriotism ) :  patriotism is an emotional attachment to a nation which an individual recognizes as their homeland  an excess of patriotism in the defense of a nation is called chauvinism ; another related term is jingoism . 
  * `` dans le grand drame , il fut le plus grand '' charles de gaulle , 1965 * `` in the great tragedy , he has been the greatest '' charles de gaulle , 1965, 
  yeah , who needs a sense of belonging to a place and a community , right ?

  beautiful , 
  [ la d\u00e9fense de belfort ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv39-cc6tgw ) yeah , mostly songs rather than videos , and with a focus on lyrics rather than the music . 
  personnal taste i suppose . 
  i think it make it really appreciable for francophones only , but i 'd be curious to see how non-francophones find it .
