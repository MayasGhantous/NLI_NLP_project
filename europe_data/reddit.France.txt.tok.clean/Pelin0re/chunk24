  i am not knowledgeable enough in pre-1917 and post-1917 russia to provide counterpoints but i would advice against putting too much weight into comparisons in history . 
  to think that the french revolution was `` fueled by philosophy '' is historical revisionism at worse , and a very annoying oversimplification at best . 
  very few enlightenement philosophers were for a republican model , for exemple . 
  contested government , the counter-powers ( in particular the parliaments - not the same kind of parliament as today ) sinking louis xvi 's tentatives of reforms and economical troubles led to the revolution . 
  i 'd say that the power game between the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy/clergy ( the bourgeoisie won ) is an equally or more relevant `` fuel '' than the `` enlightenment philosophy '' . 
  also should avoid parisian-centrism . 
  it should be noted ( because i see allusions to this quote nearly everytime the hre is named ) that it apply to the hre in voltaire 's time , and not on the hre at every point in history . 
  because in voltaire 's era the hre had n't much ground anymore to be called holy ( the emperor had ceased to be crowned/blessed by the pope , because it would be a bad political move against protestant members ) nor roman ( rome and north italy had drifted from the empire ) and had become so decentralised and its members with so much autonomy that yes , it was a poor excuse of an empire . 
  if i take the exemple of african eufor they are often just a few peacekeepers that france has to slowly convince to come along after taking most of the impact/quick intervention . 
   the reason we have to spend 3.3 % is because our european allies , canada , and japan have huge military gaps and we have to fill them . 
  no , to be honest you spent such an amount because you have extremely big geopolitical goals and commitments and want an extensive projection ability . 
  also a bit of militaro-industriel lobbying . 
  a military stronger europe would relieve the american on some operations , but i do n't think it would have a substantial impact on your spending . 
  i agree that military spending have been let down ( it 's going to go up now , hopefully , but i do n't know to which extent ) , but it would be dishonest to say that america does n't benefited/benefits greatly from nato , in other fields than the purely military . 
  nato is n't a common army , just an alliance . 
  there is no real opposition to an european alliance , because there is already one ( with nato ( which is n't just the american , everybody have a multilateral commitment ) and one of the european clause cover it i think ) . 
  a common military is another beast , and imply homogeneity of the army and command structure . 
  the first big problem is that the army is basically the ultimate opt-out , the tool of sovereignty . 
  if there is a very strong disagreement between a member-state and the commission ( or another hypothetical eu body ) , the member-state ca n't be physically compelled to do something , because it has an army , and not the eu ( for exemple the commission does n't want britain to leave ? 
  well nothing they can do to stop that ) the big problem with a common army is that we do n't have a common foreign policy , our foreign interests are n't homogenously perceived and shared . 
  if something happen in mali for exemple france is much more encline to intervene because it has companies and expats there , interests in neighboring countries , that even just morally speaking it 's an ugly thing happening there in tumbuctu and that france is less reluctant to send soldiers to fight abroad to fight and die for its ideals and interests . 
  other countries wo n't want to send the common army because they do n't have much interests there and are more reluctant/opposed to interventions . 
  basically the `` we 'll use the army only against invasion '' side will keep the army effectively useless except in case of invasion ( the virtually unavoidable scenario if we keep a unanimity mode of decision ) . 
  or the `` time to intervene '' side will send men of nations opposed to an intervention . 
  we need a stronger sense of belonging to the european identity , sharing more homogenous goals and foreign interests and a common foreign policy ( which work closely with the army in many times ) before we can really build an european army that will not be paralysed . 
   countries the size of eu member states ca n't be a global or even regional force on their own . 
  a country like france can still use its army to apply significant projection occasionally , and against a big country it has nukes and the possibility to increase the war effort if it has time . 
  i 'm not saying it cover everything , it clearly does n't , but it is still a very useful tool . 
  i blame ethnocentred universalism . 
  `` what do you mean everyone does n't naturally tend toward our societal/cultural/moral values ? 
  surely if we kill a few madmen/tyrants the people will rise to freedom and be free from obscurantism !, 
  what , ` they are not nations-states with strongly established national identity and they have deep tribal , regional and religious divisions ' ? 
  what non-sense are you spouting about ? '', 
  ( or the idea that `` a good revolution solve everything , and if it does n't work it mean that you just need to do one again '' , a french classic ), 
   he 's the least favourite candidate in the r\u00e9publicains primaries . 
  where did you get that idea ? 
  would n't it still be correct , although with a nuance ? 
  the `` to '' just add a purpose , a will behind the act , but it 's still linguistically correct , no ? 
  it gives no garantee that the next government wo n't be as shitty . 
  just that the need to keep a multi-parties coalition will make it more eratic , more unstable and less susceptible to actually do stuff . 
  like the fourth republic , or israel 's current system . 
  and goverments that fall quickly do n't make their members politically deads , you know . 
   i do n't know how france ( after the next elections ) the probability of marine le pen winning the presidential elections is extremely low , though . 
  looking at the first thread , linking to a post of -52 karma . 
  sure there is brigadding of r/subredditdrama but the concerned thread is pretty levelheaded overall for the `` worst '' than subredditdrama come with . 
  i do n't mean that it 's perfect or that there is n't biggotry , but far less than in / r/atheism . 
  well , / r/christianity seems like a pretty great subreddit , and i was pleasantly surprised by / r/islam last time i went there . 
  source ? 
  it may have happened but from what i know a botched execution just mean a botched execution . 
  good !, 
  as for aden well , he took the trade idea , so merchants everywhere . 
  muh east africa is n't that bad !, 
  at least dev 3-5 provinces make for easy coring ;(, 
  hurrah !, 
  yeah , you can take it over . 
  make it prosperous , or at least not dying !, 
  heed the above-mentionned advice , and you can try to reach an agreement ( or agree to disagree ) with / u/egil4950 ( pegu 's player ) before the session if you want to save some time and attention . 
  ( you can choose to be happy with the kind of crappy western bengalese province , enforce your claims by the sword , or reach another agreement . 
  you 're the captain of the boat now ) . 
  go forth , and may [ coptic jesus ] ( http://img03.deviantart.net/5f37/i/2014/159/5/f/jesus_coptic_art_by_joeatta78-d7lifdy.png ) be with you . 
  paging / u/rhaktor to let him know i found a sub and in case he want to do some plotting/discussion with him before session . 
  ten escaped from the local zoo forty years ago ( and others during the tempest of 1999 ) and they have since reproduced . 
  it should be noted that this mp game has been kept ( in no small amount thanks to / u/rhaktor diplomatic game and fair-play . 
  and also because of some asian shenanigans ) extremely balanced : you normally do n't see a purely african africa , almost no european presence in asia ( yet , brace yourself , it is probably coming ) , america is just an hilariously rare sight ( the two big owners of land : cheerokee and exiled cologne ) , and in general matter you normally have far more ugly borders . 
  at least from my experience . 
  if other players here want to give their mind ? 
  there should be opportunities to play good nation , though . 
  for exemple starting this week i 'll not be there anymore to play the ethiopian empire anymore . 
  i will ** not be able to play the glorious empire of ethiopia ** . 
  i strongly encourage people wanting to play to take the head of the coptic empire : i 'll not be there for the later week as well so if you want you 'll be able to keep it to the end and enjoy the fruits of your efforts . 
  ethiopia is in a relatively good position : she is bff with kilwa and have an informal alliance with tunis and the ottomans . 
  i deeply encourage the potential new player to keep these alliances and make them prosperous , to do otherwise would be not only be backstabbing but also very foolish . 
  also apparently the ai allied pegu last session . 
  basically african frontiers are drawn , ethiopia 's conquests are taking place in the wealthy indian subcontinent , where many rich provinces have been taken and cored . 
  an agreement has been reached with the ottomans and bukhara ( i can send it in pm or you can ask them ) , and i advise respecting it . 
  but bengal is ripe for the taking . 
  there is a conflicting claim with pegu who claim the richest bengalese provinces , you can negociate with him or go to war . 
  even if i 'd say military odd are good enough , finding a diplomatical compromise and keeping pegu as an ally have the huge benefit of presenting a united front against european greed . 
  the tech is n't very good , and the unbalance ( admin tech is low , you should focus on it ) gave like 10-15 corruption , but you can close the gap and the other africans are n't bad . 
  ( and at least you 're not bukhara :p ) if you maintain good relations with the africans and the ottomans , and negociate a bit with pegu , it should be a relatively easy session with enough opportunities . 
  so ** come and have a try ** . 
  all hail the house of solomon !, 
  well , technically vatican city 's got 100 % , so ... 
  louis xvi killed by janissaries ? 
  you : `` france 's services should stop this from happening '' / u/quas4r : `` you ca n't stop every attack of this kind , if there is enough tries . 
  eventually , one is bound to do it , in particular if he works ( nearly ) alone or plan quickly '' i fail to see where is the understanding problem . 
  strictly speaking `` liar '' is apparently broader as it means `` a person that has lied * or * that lies repeatedly '' . 
  but regardless the psychological and thus diplomatical effect of these words are not exactly the same . 
  perhaps some people here do n't like gratuitous insults and salty hyperboles ? 
  there is also the viewpoint of considering the head of state as a representation/unifying point of your country , like a flag , and then the comparison is a bit like burning your nation 's flag . 
  of curse you might still disagree against such laws , but it is n't purely a monarchist thing . 
  `` it does n't make any sense '' mean than there is n't any coherent theory/viewpoint justifying the existence or use of a non-elected head of state , which is completely false . 
  you can disagree with them , but do n't do as if every person opposing you on this subject is a backward moron . 
  it completely depends on what are your criteria for what you consider a `` serious power '' , though . 
  i 'd say there is a difference between a foreign minister saying than another foreign minister `` told a lot of lies during the campaign '' and `` is a liar '' . 
  the former imply a ponctual , past action , and the latter imply a present , almost chronical/pathological * modus operandi * , and is also attacking someone personally instead of his actions . 
  you may think that the difference is n't that big , but i 'd say that diplomatically it makes some difference ( in particular considering it 's a top diplomat speaking publicly of a counterpart ) and that in particular ** when you are putting quote marks you should quote the verbatim faithfully ** , which the guardian disapointingly did n't do here . 
  [ si tuvieras f\u00e9 como un granito de mostaza ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0etia52n9m ), 
  i do n't know where you came with this explanation . 
  not only it does n't make much sense ( they 'll get as much , and probably more tourism with a pretty completed basilic that one in construction ) , that was pretty much the point from the start to have a drawn out construction : it is an `` expiatory temple '' , and the goal is to have people participate in its construction , for spiritual reasons not unlike the builder of this ` cathedral ' .
