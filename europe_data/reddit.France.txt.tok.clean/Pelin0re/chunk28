  the sultan of kilwa shall be there !, 
  this campaign shall see the victory of allah 's faithfulls !, 
  ( about the save file though , last time i dowloaded it and placed it where i was told , yet it did n't work and my computer just dowloaded it normally once in the lobby ( did n't take too long as it worked for others ) . 
  i 'll try again , but hope there 's some tolerance in case of failure . ), 
  well yes , but outside of a god that garantee their absolute existence ( which is at least a consistent justification , wether one agree with it or not ) i find it hard to justify rights as `` natural '' , and more and more as you go into details . 
  i mean , it 's not written in your dna ( there is wants , needs , but not * rights * ) . 
  the declaration of human rights , if we were more honest , should be called `` convention of human rights '' . 
  well at the scale of your life they also only take a portion of your time , and you use the benefits of this investissment ( a sovereign and independant country , relatively safe ) . 
  but yes , in most cases nowadays a professional army is the optimal solution ( and an enjoyable luxury ) if you do n't have a substantial threat nearby . 
   ugh dude . 
  it 's not about fucking punishment . 
  why does everything have to be about you . 
  are you really this dense that you do n't understand what this is about ? 
  or have you just been extremely sheltered ? 
  genuinely wondering because to me it 's obvious . 
  eh , i like to discuss/debate on the internet as much as the next redditor , but i sure do n't have to do it with people who insult me . 
  i could have went for \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05db\u05dc \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9 \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05e9 instead , but there is a limit to snobism . 
  i was n't speaking only of religion , but of our wolrdview in general , and the way your accusation of `` brainwashing '' can be applied to the rest of our education :  the thing is , by the same criteria basically all we teach to kids is `` brainwashing '' . 
  the values we transmit , the models and the way to view the world , all that comes from the society where the kid grow and will shape him why , do you think that religion have the monopoly of `` torturing and burning people alive '' ( or simply killing , for that matter ) ? 
  also , culture and moral are complex things , depending on the society , it 's not some universal truth that you `` know '' , like `` basic knoledge of decency '' . 
  take slavery as an exemple : the very numerous culture that accepted it just had n't the `` knowledge of decency '' ? 
  of course , that 's just the theory . 
  but it 's a big reason behind the current weight of the marrital institution , and still relevant enough today for a lot of people . 
  by today 's standards every countries ' have a horrific history ( and algeria , or rather alger and north africa , as well with the barabesques ' piracy and slave trade for centuries ) . 
  going in algeria to makes such a semi-anachronical declaration seems to me like pointless self-flagellation at best and cattering to voters of arab/african origin ( at least the substantial parts very sensitive to the anti-colonialist rethoric ) at worse . 
  but eh , guess i `` should be punished '' for thinking like this . 
   do you have some proof for this ? 
  same as you , anectotical evidence and people i met , that 's why i stayed vague and did n't gave numbers . 
   its not that long ago , when these exact religions kills , tortures or burn people alive if they disagree with them . 
  that treatment is n't about religion in itself though , it 's about the protection of the societal order in a much less individualist society , where the perception of the group , and what allow it to form a whole , is perceived with much more strength , and human death is a bit less of a big deal considering the mortality . 
  but you 've got that outside of religions , as shown by the exemple of irreligious ideologies . 
  i 'll be honest , your use of `` the dark ages '' makes me quite uncertain of the fiability of your historical views on the question . 
   nobody forced me to do anything if i dont wanted to . 
  go to school ? 
  go to the funeral of a relative ? 
  learn x and y ? 
  do n't shoot or scream in such or such situation ? 
  do n't act that way or do this ? 
  of course that during your education you are `` forced '' to do things that you do n't want to do , and it 's considered near-irrelevant ( except when trying to make the thing more appealing to transmit it to you more easily ) . 
  that now you regret it or be happy that it was done is irrelevant to the fact that back then you did n't have as much of a choice that you seems to believe . 
  ( also `` brainwashing '' does n't necessarily mean `` against his will '' ), 
  also the huge part of `` creating a familial cell '' . 
   back to the dark age , where people belive in everything and live in artificially created buble . 
  well hello , / r/badhistory  i believe if person is not born in religious family and have decent education , its close to 0 % chance he will become catolic/muslim/jude . 
  meh , science is not antinomic with religion , and a substantial number of educated people are n't necessarily satisfied with a purely materialist vision of the world . 
   but many aspects of religion is just pure brainwashing of kids . 
  if anyone want to believe in something , he should do that from his own choice , after he will get proper non-biased education . 
  the thing is , by the same criteria basically all we teach to kids is `` brainwashing '' . 
  the values we transmit , the models and the way to view the world , all that comes from the society where the kid grow and will shape him , and that this society transmit an atheistic , agnostic or religious metaphysical point of view , it 's always a biased transmition , a `` non-biased '' or `` neutral '' education simply does n't exist . 
  yeah , our speaker is also named `` pr\u00e9sident de l'assembl\u00e9e / s\u00e9nat '' , it 's just that when we say `` the president '' without anything else it normally means `` the president of the republic '' . 
  oh , i googled a bit and apparently `` president of the government '' is the name you give to the prime minister . 
  my confusion comes from the fact that the `` president '' is often the head of state and the prime minister the head of government , and as you already have a king as head of state i was quite confused with the role of an eventual president . 
  president of spain ?? 
  the sultan of kilwa rejoice with his muslims brothers learning of their victories , and mourn with them of the way it was spoiled . 
  may your brotherhood stay united and allah willing , take back iberia . 
  my prayers ( and perhaps my ducats ) shall be with you on this arduous path . 
  ** kilwa ** here : i missed the first part , and when i got there in the rehost the ai had truce/alliances with nearly all possible targets . 
  nevertheless i managed to apply my planned shenanigans and * adopt feudalism * ( even if i had to grant 2 provinces to my vassal for that ) and started the conquest of madagascar . 
  so things are going right , my economy is thriving thanks to my boosted gold province of kilwa ( inflation ? 
  what inflation ? ), 
  i 'll be able to annex my vassal in two years , and i even got a promising 5/4/3 heir ( pleasedontdieinafuckingevent ) . 
  3 hours is a bit short , though , in particular since technical difficulties and waiting periods make it more like 2 hours , which does n't allow to get a lot of things done at speed 2 . 
  4-5 hours would be better . 
  observer is fine by me , because the player do n't see a huge chunk of the map and have his attention elsewhere . 
  3 minutes seems fine by me . 
  yes , someone could gain information by watching , but only a few , ( i hope ) and they 'd waste time and attention watching you and waiting for relevant usable information . 
  the optimism is strong with this one ... 
  meh , i 'd say we can still differenciate the size : if we say `` un village '' , it 's generally no more than a few hundreds of inhabitants . 
  then i suppose `` bourg '' or `` bourgade '' could be used for cities with a few thousands of inhabitants , though we use `` ville '' or `` commune '' in nearly all cases . 
  sultanate is love , sultanate is life . 
  ca n't wait to reform my government , though . 
  honestly yeah , i 'm not putting odds in favor of ottomans ' containment . 
  but who knows ? 
  a man can dream ... also the mameluks should ally with the others neighbors to put down the otto quickly . 
  unless he try to eat the anatolian ais while he 's occupied elsewhere . 
  kilwa is ready to build an independant [ africa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mmjngshtl8 ) ( [ english version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du5nj5lvjgq ) ) ... 
  good luck , you 'll need it . 
  if you do n't form a giant alliance at the first day of the game to remove him immediatly , the green death wo n't miss you . 
  well i may be a bit biased as i participated in one of the / r/europe games as hejaz ( and next campaign ethiopia ) and got wrecked by ottomans even when managing to gather enough ally to put him in difficulties : he 'd just peace out with the italians for exemple and then proceed to trash me and the one or two allies i entered a separate war with . 
  same for defensive wars : containment is virtually impossible . 
  which i find very unnerving and unbalancing . 
  even more so since the great power system give even more tools to the big ones . 
  the sheer number of players here may make it possible if they all ally together in a big alliance ( removing kebab is worth the diplo malus for 2-3 years ) at the first day then attack , but i do n't have the impression they 're trying to do so . 
  they are either very unprepared or very sneaky . 
  considering the number of players around the ottomans , for once it * may * be possible to make them bite the dust before they blob . 
  but you should form an alliance at the very beginning of the game ( in particular with the `` do n't ally after a war started '' rule which is very good for the ottomans and very annoying for small nations ) , and discuss it even before the start . 
   ah , a huge chunk of the population was annexionnistic sure thing bro . 
  would really love to see any sources for that . 
   because guess what the politicians were n't actually as retarded as you 'd think this tone sure makes me want to research sources to continue this relaxed academic debate / s, 
  i have to disagree with your disagreement : a huge chunk of the population was annexionnist and germany * did * plan to annex the north-east of france ( and place her in economical dependance with a treaty of commerce , occupy belgium and luxembourg , push back russia with poland and beltic states under german control with buffer states , and annex congo ) . 
  i do n't have the books under hand to give you my sources , so i searched on internet to confirm and [ behold the semptemberprogramm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/septemberprogramm ), 
   that is true , but i 'd argue that without the british the french would n't have declared war on germany . 
  but france `` declared war '' on germany only because germany was already invading belgium to attack them . 
  and germany was doing that because they wanted to `` break the containment '' , perceived as threatening , of both france and russia , and the war was viewed as an excellent occasion for that . 
  and i fail to see why without the british germany would n't have attacked . 
   building ships takes quite a long time though . 
  i do n't agree that the time would 've been enough sorry , i do n't understand . 
  in which scenario ? 
   also , there would n't have been a reason for germany to even attack france in any case . 
  the reasons of france-germany antagonism are different from the naval race though .
