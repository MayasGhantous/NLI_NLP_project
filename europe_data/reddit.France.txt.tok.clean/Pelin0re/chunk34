  promptly , the pope pursued this insolent band and eliminated them among ancona 's hills . 
  but the people of roma were running out of food and despair was crippling the formidable will to fight of the romans : time was running out ( 7 % siege ) . 
  having only had time and men to raise two more regiments , the pope decided to strike now before it was too late and the napolinese could send any reinforcements or that the holy capital fell . 
  around 13 000 soldiers faced each others on each side , the papal troops getting a small numerical advantage thanks to a reinforcement of the small urbinese contingent , but naples having got the services of a bold and very competent general ( 5 shock ) , and each having a particular advantage in quality on the other . 
  the armies fought , spilled blood , and held as their number were cut down . 
  the stakes were too high to run , the battle too close for any side to think themself the sure victor , and this through the whole melee . 
  as the fight dragged to an end , both lines on the edge of crumbling , two fresh regiments came from southern italy , walking as fast as they could to assist in the fight , close enough for both commanding officers to knew it , close enough to make the difference ... but the center did not held , and naples ' battle line collapsed , getting cut down to the last by the urbineses while the exhausted , bloodied but still more numerous papal army ` welcomed ' the fresh napolinese coming too late . 
  ** victory ** . 
  sweet , almost surprising victory . 
  on this note , ( and the rehost happening just in the middle of the battle ) the wind turned : under french and polish diplomatic pressure , austria pulled out of the war , and hungary joined the war and disembarked troops in italy , enough to throw a counter attack and make the hunter the hunted . 
  savoy got sieged to the last province and fort and naples got attacked by the opportunist but well-supported tunisian . 
  in the end , savoy lost wallis to milan and nice to the papal states , who also took abruzzi from naples . 
  after savoring victory and survival for a short time , the pope sent an army to take ( again , with milan 's assistance ) ferrara from his excommunicated duke , and after imposing his domination answered the milanese call to arm against venice and his weak allies , to further affirm the control of their alliance on italy . 
  what challenges lies further , for christendom and his holy church ? 
  is france 's unholy alliance but a temporary compromise to ensure his survival ? 
  will the hordes of mahometans that stuck together and dared put their feet on italy and raid papal provinces pursue further their expansion ? 
  what of the great turk , the polish and the hordes , the plotting english , the weakened spanish , the complex balance of the holy roman empire ? 
  the wise men make their plans ready to crumple when they 'll touch reality and the fools look at the sky to see something that might unravel the future to their eyes , a sign ... an * omen * ... ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ economy , ^ ^ ^ ^ fools !,

  meh , you can just wait for the lowered price and/or just buy a few really useful dlc ( art of war/common sense in particular ), 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/via-wheninmanila.com-1.jpg ) i 'm postulating for the papal states . 
  gorgeous ? 
  britain played the game of thrones , and lost , and paid most of the price . 
  j e r u s a l e m e r u s a l e m one does not simply take jerusalem from a true catholic !, 
  no further intel , the salt mine is deep , and [ our archivists are currently lost in it ] ( https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2013/04/the-strange-beauty-of-salt-mines/s05_24042462/main_900.jpg?1420510192 ) . 
  the king of great britain is impatient to start this very promising session !, 
  and i hope we 'll get someone willing to stream , 
  my pleasure , 
  eu4 is grand strategy game ( disponible on steam ) : you play a nation and try to make it prosperous and strong , take your neighbors/rivals ' provinces and survive the attempts of your ennemies ( and the backstabbing of your allies ) . 
  it starts on 1444 and end in 1821 ( though multiplayers rarely go as far ) and is played on real time with a second being worth a few days ( depending on the speed played ) . 
  it is quite complex game , so you 'd need to play at least a few hours to learn the most important mechanism , and it 's an interesting part of the game : we still learn new things even after hundreds of hours of playing it ( i understood how trade worked exactly after like 500 hours , and forts by watching an explaining video after 700 hours ) . 
  playing in mp is great , and we spend far much time plotting between session than playing xd . 
  if you want to join [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6glhuy/reuropes_eu4_campaign_is_starting_today_at_18h/ ) is a thread explaining a bit the details . 
  basically buy the base game on steam , play it some hours on solo and come on the discord to discuss it with us and get a country : there 's not a lot of viable countries not taken , but there 's generaly a few absent in need of a substitute , or ( since you would be very new ) you can take one of my colonial nations ( i play great britain ) and watch a bit the situation unfold without too much responsibilities or risk . 
  what did the wise and benevolent british empeor have ever done to you ? 
  he brought back some weight to the imperial title !, 
  did you prefer montferrat or savoy as emperors ? 
  would you have preferred france ? 
  or is it the fever of sectarian hate that cloud your appreciation ? 
  ** the emperor protects **, 
  see you then !, 
   try to come a few hours/days before on the discord , see what countries are disponible ( though there 's generally a few countries in need of subbing just before the start ) and get a feeling of the situation . 
  well there have been / r/europe mp since more than one year , and there is a base of fervent players , so yeah it 's gon na stay i think . 
  there 's never enough players to my taste , but also contrary to wikki96 i think there is opportunities to join : just today there was several countries which were subbed , and a few that were up to grab . 
  it depends on who 's here , and it 's true that it 's a bit dangerous to take the countries left ( unless you 're lucky enough to have a nice country in need of subbing or even with the player that ca n't play anymore , which will probably happen several time with the coming summer ) . 
  would still place de gaulle there . 
  also either john paul ii or john xxiii ( for vatican council ) , they were both preeeetty important for the second half of the 20th century . 
  meh , it 's debatable . 
  the 60s were n't the 90s or the 00s . 
  well it is a religion and not a state , it 's just just one of which the religious leader is also a head of state . 
  apparently not ... 
  and why are you so adamant to go against the international consensus on this issue ? 
   widely considered a sovereign subject of international law , [ 8 ] the order maintains diplomatic relations with 106 states . 
  it has united nations permanent observer status , [ 9 ] enters into treaties , and issues its own passports , coins , and postage stamps . 
  its two headquarters buildings in rome enjoy extraterritoriality , similar to embassies , and it maintains embassies in other countries . 
  the three principal officers are counted as citizens . 
  though its sovereignty is disputed by some legal scholars , it is often given as the only remaining example of a sovereign entity which entirely lacks territory . 
  interest for aesthetics and culture have historically be quite tied to christianism/catholicism , though , so i see nothing problematic with that , nor unbecoming of the teachings of jesus . 
   the swiss used to be among europe 's most fearsome mercenaries and took part in a sack of rome . 
  afterwards the vatican hired them for protection . 
  which one ? 
  the swiss were already hired by the papal states in 1527 . 
  the major basilics of rome for exemple have extraterritoriality . 
  interestingly , st john of latran , which is the actually seat ( cathedre ) of the bishop of rome ( yes , it 's not st peter ) hold the bronze door of the ( late empire ) roman senate . 
  well then that 's the most country-like non-country that is still a non-country , 
  if you wish , it 's easier once you understand that there is three distincts entities , that the holy see is the administrative and diplomatic one , that the catholic church is the religious/sacramental one , and that the city of vatican is just a small sovereign piece of land to guarantee the independance of the two other institutions . 
  and that the thing that tie these , in a way separate institutions , together is primarily the fact that they have all three the pope at their head . 
  it is not a surprise anymore to see the austrian king lie through his teeth ... 
  democracy ... what is this strange concept ? 
  well actually it is a true one in the case of constitutionnal revision . 
  this session was quite an animated one , though the first half was very disappointing for the king of great britain and emperor of the holy roman emperor . 
  it started with a betrayal and a failed plot , when austria , despite negocitations to conclude religious peace with the emperor , refused the white peace offer and with his numerous protestant leaguers , crushed the catholic league on the continent . 
  the taste was bitter , but the sea stayed under control of the royal navy ( a small fleet of heavies was destroyed when an overconfident amiral tried to push deeper into the baltic to surprise a swedish fleet , but one hundred light ships ensured a following victory to ensure the protestants could nurture no illusion ) and none could siege the british islands for this reason , and the emperor refused to accept the protestant supremacy that would deprive him of his crown . 
  in the end , after many years of religious conflict , unable to siege the islands , the protestant accepted to sign the peace of westphalia . 
  so many years and good men lost by the sectarism of the protestant fanatics . 
  but not all plotting went unrewarded . 
  when britain became emperor , it had bought a french province temporary to connect them to the hre , then made a path of hre provinces to ireland . 
  here , it had put three provinces in particular in the empire , and released them as vassal , then broke the vassalisation and named them electors . 
  after the end of the league war ( which had seen the emperor dying and his son inheriting the crown as league wars do n't allow a change of emperor ) , the princes were conquered and vassalised , and great britain now had 3 loyal electors on 6 , garanteeing ** perpetual emperorship ** !, 
  all hail brittania !, 
  in the same move , portuguese la plata was taken , and though quickened rebels proclaimed independance shortly after , the territory is currently under reconquest . 
  colonisation advanced a bit erratingly , and natives uprisings set it back many time , the troops not being always there or in time to ~ ~ genocide ~ ~ pacify the province . 
  also , the glorious plotting of the emperor ensured him a worthy price : his counterpart of the east , byzantium , sold him the palestinian coast and , after a quick conquest against the mamluks , great britain had not only an access to the indian ocean but also had ** put jerusalem back in christian hands ** . 
  many deus were vulted that day . 
  overall great session , but please , let 's cancel the protection rule after a certain year/era , because now each absence is just blocking someone 's ( and here , several people ) paths of expansion . 
  ah , typical protestant propaganda !, 
  equality of candidate was the proposal of the emperor since the first year of the conflict , but the enemies of the crown , having no trouble with `` forces outside the empire '' when swedish intervention suit them , requested in their sectarian mindset that only protestant princes be elected . 
  it is only through the emperor 's perseverance than religious liberty prevailed !, 
  and you can deny me all you want , spite thy venom on my name and my armies , but you can not erase the truth : the imperial crown will stay british . 
  i ** am ** the electors !, 
  this : our collective psychological reaction ( be it the politicians , the medias or the population ) to terrorism is disproportionnate , because terrorism aim to provoke such a reaction ; someone getting mugged and killed in a dark street will stay unheard , but someone beheaded in daylight will shock people and be spoken of by media and politician . 
  though you should n't discard the politicians ' attitude as pure cynism : although they have political incentives to talk of terrorism , they are emotionally impacted/compromised too . 
  they are humans , and they often get on the places where attentats have just been commited , see the bodies , see the video images ... and even if one had enough hindsight to fight his gut reaction * and * refuse the political opportunity , saying what is basically `` terrorism is n't that dangerous '' is basically political suicide , you 'll be accused of disrespect to the victims and their families and to hide your head in the sand . 
  most people refuse to accept the slightest possibility of death if it is shoved in their face . 
  all hail britannia !, 
  britannia rule the waves !, 
  at the start of the session , without the slightest suspicion from its prey , england ~ ~ ruthlessly ~ ~ shrewdly attacked iceland , having decades before fabricated a claim on a louisianan province . 
  the english crown tought that the fight would be easy : they fielded twice more troops than the icelanders could ever hope field , could keep iceland 's island capital without problem and a war of attrition war was unwinnable for the nordic colonisers . 
  but these * americans * fought bitterly , disappearing in the mist of the inland territory they knew the secrets of , taking advantage of the distractions of the english generals and their overconfidence , shedding the blood of many young english men , even managing to secure louisiana and retake the east coast until the generals got their shit together and pushed south to retake the east coast while sticking their troops together . 
  at this point the war had dragged on for many years , throwing several plans the english crown had in disarray .
