  and of course there is the fact that she could have lied and told whatever arranged her . 
  well , something fundamentally imperfect in both , at least . 
  not really `` no other banks '' . 
  no french or european banks because these banks decided to stop lending to political parties . 
  i think that they would have found money elsewhere , but perhaps not at this interest rate . 
  i do n't think that putin is the only one in the world willing to loan money to the fn . 
  this is the bank with which they made a contract , and it 's probably an advantageous one , but i do n't think it is the only bank that would have lent them money . 
  the one who pay is ruling , if he is the only source of money . 
  care to expand on the fake bank ? 
  oh , i was in fact more reacting to / u / / harrysplinkett sentence :  no , it was because the asshole that i was replying to did n't bother to read my post ( i said twice that i am no fan of putin ) and called me a shill putin bot instead and went on to generalize all russians ( just like you did , how nice ) . 
  i 'd wager that would n't have happened without my flair . 
  i may agree with the point he made , but this kind of insult does n't contribute to the debate and contribute to make the world an uglier place . 
  of course , the possibly confusing generalisation does n't help either :p, 
  i agree . 
  my point was more of a correction on the `` taking order from moscow '' analogy , where it is indeed more of a `` objective allies '' thing . 
  seriously , people should stop with the `` the fn take its order from moscow '' . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it contracted a loan ( a loan , not a gift ) with a russian bank , but it just means that the fn and the kremlin have good relations . 
  the fn is not desesperate for money at the point of kneeling at the feet of the first ready to loan them money ( i think they could have found it elsewhere if not there ) . 
  seriously , fn is strong enough to not be at the mercy of a foreign backer , and historically they do n't have heavy ties with russia . 
  marine is n't some kind of subordonnate/vassal of putin , and i do n't think he have much influence on the choice of the fn . 
  the reason of this proximity is not money ( the loan is more a gesture of good will/friendship imo ) : the fn and the kremlin are objective allies in their animosity toward european integration , their * realpolitik * approach of geopolitic and their defiance of the usa . 
  i precise that i am not a fn elector , i just do n't like to see this stupid simplification done in a recurrent manner , it 's not necessarily obvious for those non-familiar with the french political scene , and even then the temptation of simplification can be strong . 
  it really is n't the same thing here . 
  the communist parties took their legitimacy and their connection with other communists parties from their relation with the kremlin , and they had real ideological ties . 
  the fn and putin are objective allies right now , but saying that marine is taking its orders from the kremlin ( which seems to be a popular opinion here on / r/europe ) is really underestimating the fn . 
  there is probably some other europeans countries doing it as well or better than us . 
  we call it viennoiseries for a reason after all . 
  ... actually , the pessimist stereotype is probably true as wel ... 
  the problem is that the `` verstehen '' mean `` understand '' in german . 
  the point / u/harrysplinkett made was that it was an extremely bad nickname . 
  and i agree with him . 
  he may have a point on the russian flag : while most people here do n't , imo , have a visceral anti-russian reaction , it probably makes people more suspicious when speaking of the ukrainian conflict , and more inclined to see it trhough the prism of the information confrontation . 
  although , while being misunderstoof can be irritating , there is no need to start calling other assholes ... 
  every stereotypes about us is false or completely obsolete . 
  except the baguette stereotype . 
  this one is true . 
  hmmm ... baguette ... 
  well this is indeed a long rant ( and without paragraphs ) , but a very instructive one . 
  thank you a lot , this is exactly the kind of analysis/explanation i wanted , 
  * while you 're there , and since you are apparently from kiev , your thoughts/news about vitali klitschko and his work as a mayor and party leader ? 
  if we want to contest the english hegemony we need to put some good will into it  *, 
  * in this cas the term `` evil '' would have probably been more appropried than `` bad '' . 
  well , russia will be pissed . 
  and france want to keep acceptable relation with russia . 
  and any country doing business with france will consider france as a far less reliable partner , in particular in the weapons sales . 
  [ look at this film !, 
  ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyrano_de_bergerac_%28film,_1990%29 ) it 's in alexandrine , perfect for language learning purpose !, 
  seriously , this is a gem . 
  still some historically low popularity . 
  but yeah , in politics everything can happen . 
  basically i see him having some chance of winning if he face sarkozy . 
  otherwise ... 
  at least we are starting to break free of this despotic anglo-centered hegemony ! ~ ~ congratulations to our new mods and good luck to improve this already pretty good place  * a tous les francophones : le loup est dans la bergerie . 
  we 're the only funding member of the eurovision who never had nul points . 
  i hope that it will continue this way . 
  basically we are compelled to either consider eurovision as irrelevant and unimportant , or think that we have no friends whatsoever in europe . 
  not even the francophones country gave us one point . 
  we gave twelve points to belgium , and received not a single one . 
  and our song was n't that bad . 
  so yeah , fuck you eurovision . 
   i kind of liked france 's song but i thought it was an odd choice for the eurovision . 
  doom and gloom in a saccharine sea of effervescence . 
  we are the song that the eurovision needs , but not the one that it deserves . 
  it was legally a possibility . 
  a referendum can be consitutional ( article 89 ) or legislative ( art 11 ) . 
  over my dead body !, 
  down with the english cultural hegemony !, 
  but seriously , i think it would be good if the tv gave translated subtitles for the songs . 
  i know that it 's in direct , but it should n't be that hard . 
  well , it is about the desolation of a village in ww1 . 
  supposedly it is not about the armenian genocide , but i do n't buy it . 
  aside from the fact that it is the 100 year anniversary , some lyrics just do n't go that well with ww1 and much better with the armenian genocide . 
  but well , you 're not * supposed * to be making polemics and political moves ... still cool thing to do , and i like the style , the performance and the lyrics . 
  and the fact that it is not in english , obviously . 
  * ** remains only for me the ashes ** ** of my village immersed in the silence ** ** i am but a wound ** ** a heart without armor ** ** how survive to this ? 
  ** * mais je suis l\u00e0 , je n\u2019oublie pas * * dans mon village balay\u00e9 par l\u2019histoire * * et je vis l\u00e0 , n\u2019oubliez pas * * effac\u00e9 des cartes et des m\u00e9moires * ** but i am here , i do n't forget ** ** in my village swept by history ** ** and i live there , do n't forget ** ** erased from maps and memories ** * je me souviens du rire des enfants * * la voix des hommes quand ils partaient au champ * * les f\u00eates des moissons * * l\u2019odeur dans les maisons * * les \u00e9clats d\u2019amour et de joie * ** i remember the laughter of children ** ** the voice of the men when they went to the fields ** ** the feasts of the harvests ** ** the bursts of love and joy ** * mais je suis l\u00e0 , n\u2019oubliez pas * * effac\u00e9 des cartes et des m\u00e9moires * ** but i am there , do n't forget ** ** erased from maps and memories ** * quand ils sont arriv\u00e9s * * cach\u00e9s derri\u00e8re leurs armes * * ils \u00e9taient des milliers * * ils riaient de nos larmes * ** when they came ** ** hidden behind their weapons ** ** they were thousands ** ** they laughed of our tears ** * ils ont voulu d\u00e9truire * * nos croyances et nos \u00e2mes * * avec des mots de haine * * que l'on n'connaissait pas . 
  * ** i am here this evening ** ** amidst these ruins ** ** to talk to you about hope ** ** and to sing you life ** ** and i make the vow ** ** when blood will be dry ** ** to build my town anew ** ** so much more beautiful than before . 
  * ** but do n't forget . 
  well , at least france did much better than last year ( was n't really difficult ) and did a song with meaningful lyrics about the armenian genocide . 
  not gon na win , but doing a decent song in french is good enough , and doing some hommage to our armenians bro is almost enough to makes me forget last year . 
  i would still put 987 and the election of hughes capet as king above the revolution . 
  because in the end it is the capetians who , king after king , battle after battle and centuries of political scheming , shaped france as we know it . 
  the revolution was followed by a lot of change of regimes and its importance has been in my opinion , overstated by the republic and its politicians and historians which used as a founding republican myth . 
  still a pretty big event , though , and my choice is debatable . 
  ^ shhhh , ^ not ^ so ^ loud ... 
  well , to be fair , the fall of the roman empire was in big part caused by the unability of the empire , in its last centuries , to integrate the populations coming ( well , `` coming '' hide more complex dynamics ) from the east . 
  that and heavy political instability . 
  both factors helped each other in a vicious circle , destroying roman unity . 
  sometimes war ? 
  i think that the only difference on this point would be that an independant guyana would raise the price for the eu : as you said , it 's by far the best launch site available so if guyana want to milk the eu ( to some extent ) they could . 
  then there is the security and secrecy protection issues : it 's much easier if the site is owned by a member state and not by another state . 
  but yeah , the lauch site would remain there . 
  well , the embargo is still technically in place , no ? 
  even if the president has agreed , there is still negociations to undergo/complete and a part of the congress is reluctant before this , no ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  plus , something not to be forgotten : france is present in the caraibes ( guadeloupe , martinique ) and in south america ( guyane ) and is thus a regional actor . 
  on the contrary , we got quite a heavy media coverage of the the `` historic '' relaxing . 
  and hollande have n't an history of opposing the us just for the principe . 
  not a `` step backwards '' , he simply said that it was n't `` modern '' per se .
