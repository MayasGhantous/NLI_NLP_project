assuming there 's no `` we could spend money on much better things '' animosity against it . 
  from what i 've heard , that 's the general feeling about it . 
  i was neutral to it , but i 've grown to be a bit opposed to them because of the constant and daily advertising for them . 
  and especially becaue of the fact that it 's presented as if * everyone * was rooting for us to get the olympics , when it 's ** clearly ** not the case . 
  i wish the cio were n't actinf like fifa or other questionable institutions though . 
  i also hope it wo n't cost us too much money , although i 'm positive it will ( i live in nanterre , a peripheric town near paris in which there should be some events ) . 
  they do more harm than good to the left . 
  i have a few personal friends that are antifa , they are genuinely good people . 
  but imo their approach to politics is plain wrong , and they want to be subversive more than they want to actually achieve social progress and the broader struggle . 
  creuse , loz\u00e8re , ard\u00e8che du sud-ouest ... most of the `` empty diaognal '' . 
  malongo is my everyday brand , it 's pretty good , ethical trade and roughly the same price as the other brands . 
  once every month or so i buy a zapatista coffee from a roastery near my home , but it 's a bit more expensive , and not as good . 
  if it answers to the question a bit more , in france there is also [ superdupont ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q_yq_kmumde/uzkenere_ei/aaaaaaaaajo/yd4idwss3_w/s1600/superdupont.jpg ) , a parody of superman . 
  i assumed for a long time that c\u00e9cile de france was ... french . 
  she 's actually from belgium . 
  and `` camarade '' for some people with certain political ideologies . 
  nope . 
  when people talk about the region , they say \u00cele-de-france , when they talk about the city , they say paris . 
  there 's no confusion as it 's really not the same thing , especially for french people used to knowing the differences between city/d \u00e9partements / regions and so on , altough it was a valid question coming from a foreigner !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bureau_\\ ( tv_series \\ ) ) clearly my favorite serious series so far . 
  quite a few times . 
  born in 1993 . 
  also quiche and panini like stuff you can buy at a bakery, 
  dutch ? 
  absinthe , cognac as well ? 
  i 'd like to add that outside of classic homebrewing , i know many people including my roommates and i who mix small doses of fruit alcohol with some plants in order to have an homemade alcohol . 
  not really moonshine , way less alcoholic than traditional eaux-de-vie , but it 's quite common here . 
  i 'd say it 's a tie between [ cassoulet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cassoulet ) and croziflette ( variation of [ tariflette ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartiflette ) but using dark-wheat pasta instead of potatoes ) . 
  i like rich food . 
  ps : i almost to forget to mention the gizzard salad . 
  not so much a dish as an entry but delicious nonetheless . 
  i fear it would be pretty hard top understand these songs from another country . 
  typically , py favorite one is ** balkany rap ** ( https://youtu.be/v_ztbs1juou ) , but it 's quite hard , if not outright impossible to get the message because of the slang , the puns and the wordplays within the lyrics . 
  one of the most famous one is `` hypocrites '' , coming from \u00e0 speech from left-wing politician jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon : https://youtu.be/cm1aqk30kfs, 
  there are much more , but one of my favorite in french is * je m ` en bats les couilles * , which translates as * i hit my balls with it * , i.e. 
  i dont care . 
  in the same way : * \u00e7a m ` en touche une sans faire bouger l'autre * --  * it touches one of mine ( genitals ) without making the other move *, 
  basically anything about duck . 
  duck confit , especially . 
  a good cassoulet is a dreamer . 
  in desert , i 'd say a nuts pie ( in my region you do an icing with plant-based liquor , such as chartreuse or g\u00e9n\u00e9pi , it 's fantastic ) . 
  no , the pope actually has both status , as church leader and head of state of the state which is the holy see . 
  it 's a different institution from the church , and recognized as an independent state , which explains its diplomatic relations as a sovereign state engaged with other states and govnts , and its place within the international system . 
  besides the holy see as well, 
  in turkey , religion is specified on your id , you have to make an express demand to the administration to change it . 
  so i imagine many people do n't believe it 's worth the hassle to do it . 
  it would be good if a turk from here could enlighten us on this practice ? 
  soon , i hope . 
  being very catholic , mostly . 
  seems fair . 
  we also got the wine though ... 
  do n't know if it 's your style , but for french rap i can give you some advice . 
  it 's debatable as a non-european country , i 'd say it 's european , but i 'd pick turkey . 
  i find its history , struggles with minorities both in the past and now , with the kurdish/alevi/others situation ... fascinating . 
  the way turkey as a nation emerged after a conceptualization that preceded the political movement is really interesting to me . 
  besides , i 've become quite a fan of turkish litterature ( admittedly the most famous examples , such as yachar kemal ) , so that helps . 
  and all of that started through a turkish girl , that seemed fitting . 
  haha yes my bad . 
  haribo then . 
  it really changes with the different regions , so i 'll let less fortunate frenchmen answer for their own liquors , but for my part it 's the beautiful [ chartreuse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chartreuse_\\ ( liqueur \\ ) ) , made in a monastery near my city of grenoble in the french alps . 
  having family from normandy , i 've been accustomed to [ calva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calvados ) as well . 
  the best of them all ( warning though , it 's really lefty ) : [ sans la nommer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouaytc9njfu ) , ( * not to name her * ) , de georges moustaki . 
  a bit hard to translate , but it 's about the confession of love for the permanent revolution , personnified into * her * . 
  it 's quite known in france , moustaki himself being really famous . 
  it 's not a country that pops up in news or other stuff here , except for elections , especially the last ones . 
  what do i think about austria ? 
  mountainous , red vienna/rest of the country , slightly racists folks ( but maybe i met the wrong ones ) . 
  it has b\u00e9chamel within , that 's the whole difference , 
  [ croque-monsieur . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croque-monsieur ) always thought everyone ate that when out of ideas and on a tight budget , found out it 's quite uncommon for foreigners . 
  few people . 
  i have a masters degree in humanities , in which english is mandatory up to the very end of your program . 
  some of my friends who have done the same degree can speak quite good english ( i 'd say 2 ) ; others ca n't or wo n't try due to being afraid of failing or sounding bad . 
  of 20 people i can think of , all of them having a degree , i 'd say 5-6 can speak english with a stranger , 2 could be seen as ` fluent ' . 
  not mentioning the others that i 'm l'ess familiariser with , i thnk it 'd b\u00e9 \u00e0 shame to merely pass through belgium . 
  there 's much to do and discovery there !, 
  ( plus the beer , of course ) . 
  now luxembourg , on the other hand ... 
   apart for the mont saint michel , camembert and cider , d-day rememberance tours is one of the big reasons to go visit this region . 
  what about the lovely landscapes ? 
  seems like typical breton propaganda ... 
  i 'd give it to the [ mus\u00e9e de l'arm\u00e9e ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mus%c3%a9e_de_l%27arm%c3%a9e ) . 
  it 's quite an large museum , covering up many eras , and has very interesting permanent collections about the status of military and military members within civil and political society as a whole during different eras . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of military related stuff , but i 'm a big museum goer , and that was for me one of the biggest surprises visiting museums : although there are obivously some elements of it , the straightforward propaganda about the ` glory the french army ' is way less present than you 'd expect from an institution directly owned by the ministry of defense ; and there are some really interesting temporary expositions , sometimes in collaboration with other parisian museums ( last time , for example , was an expo about gunpowder , both in this museum for the military applications , and in other inner-city museum for the other aspects ) . 
  if you happen to stop by paris , that could be a good afternoon spent if you 're into this kinda stuff . 
  build roads ? 
  aqueducts ? 
  gave glorious france to the world ? 
  overseas territories , and rural & pauperized parts of france . 
  i think i do agree that it relies totally on the places involved , but i do n't think it means much . 
  i mean , by that logic , france alone is way more diverse culturally because of her overseas territory than the whole of continental us . 
  there are , i 'd bet , more similitudes between new jersey , texas , alaska and california than there are between martinique , saint-pierre-et-miquelon , wallis-et-futuna ( ruled by 2 kings on the republic 's territory ) , nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie , larzac , bretagne and \u00cele-de-france . 
  ftfy ( c\u00c7pt ), 
  in my eyes , one the best piece of litterature ever . 
  it 's such a pity that it can not be propery translated . 
  funny , cause dutch here are stereotyped for not being direct enough , even over polite / hypocritical sometimes . 
  i seen it is perceived as a way to make sure no onextra gets offended by any of your words , but it 's pretty annoying . 
  especially when discussing actual topics . 
  yeah , i do n't think people really believe that . 
  but , for the same reason , it 's not offensive either .
