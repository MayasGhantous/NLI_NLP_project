no , we are elite redditors , 
  totally different context and forces here . 
  with all due respect , germany is not what it was back in the 30s , from a military perspective . 
  not even speaking about the country shape ( stable economically and socially ) and the really cautious mindset which is in place now in europe . 
  we do n't dare do risky stuff and tend to take all necessary precautions ... you could say the same about japan but their forces and mindset is miles away than where it was back then . 
   meaning a full war breaking out ( and i currently do n't see that coming you are telling it yourself , shitstorm is not forecastable , and in peace time it 's way easier to justify defense budget cut . 
  the plebe is satisfied like this ... ( not my opinion ... at all ... ), 
  that was n't what i was saying . 
   germany fighting russia again would inevitably lead to ww3 my point was , talking about a sole involvement '' ** inevitably ** '' leading to ww3 is putting way too much importance on a single state . 
  the involvement of the us or even china ** may ** lead to ww3 , i hardly think about any other nation ( even the uk or france ) that ** may ** lead to ww3 . 
  i think you overestimate the germany involvement ( in case it would happened ) and the outcome of a possible conflict within ukraine . 
  edit : seriously hope it was humor . 
  against , as long as nothing is clearly decided on a nato/un level . 
  moreover the situation there is way too unstable at the moment to send troops brainlessly , armed force are not supposed to manage a civil war . 
  un peacekeeping forces might be a temporary solution ( if it is better managed than in yugoslavia ) . 
  but they took our jobs !, 
  clear and `` simple '' tense & vocabulary is the key here . 
  it was perfectly written to be readable by a foreigner but not the style we are used to . 
  / r/dclauzel did an impressive job to be comprehensive by anybody ... to the point i had difficulty to read . 
  it 's difficult to explain but as i 'm used to something more complex , my brain is not wired to read that level of speech . 
  ( maybe being sick & dizzy does n't help ) . 
  really ? 
  i mean for real ? 
  i 'm not a big fan of extreme freedom of speech ( i like extreme freedom of debate though ) , but seeing this in our modern world is mind blowing ... 
  i was actually referring to vocabulary used in rugby as there is no such things as `` friendly game '' . 
  only friendly 3rd half . 
  but i like your style . 
  shall i say it in french ? 
  fair enough , but france was n't comparable back then , with what it is right now . 
  neither do i  just having an open enthusiast talk on this topic . 
  it was a pleasure exchanging with you . 
  kinda what i meant ... 
  all in all , do n't you think the cost added of all development and maintenance of stovl compatible jets is far higher than the added investment of a catobar carrier ? 
  edit : i admit it is easier to have a critical look at decisions taken decades ago . 
   harriers were not really meant to go toe to toe against modern air superiority fighters , but they dealt with the old a-4 skyhawks and mirage iii 's the argentinians used , the su-27 would have eaten a harrier alive definitely agree with you but i picked up , radically different , same generation aircraft on purpose as they might have faced each other overseas . 
  the current trend of navy fighters fleet highly rely on multi-purpose , and it was already the case at the harrier 's time . 
  potentially he might be involved in dogfights , which is not really in its operational range . 
  my point was mainly , would it have been the case if , by design , the rn chose a different configuration ( catobar ) with better performing aircraft ? 
   the tornado 's would have had responsibility for those . 
  in bvr he may have a chance indeed , i do n't think he can stand the duel otherwise . 
  ( just to add something important , i 'm not a specialist , only an enthusiast ) i think it actually work both ways , we are simply not talking about the same forces here ( vertical vs horizontal resistance ) . 
  but you are right adaptation form a catobar compatible plane would be easier . 
  just have a look at the recent f35c issues with the landing hook & landing gear during arrested landing . 
  sorry mate , i edited it right before you posted ( i realized my mistake ) . 
  while it 's an interesting tactical advantage , i 'm not sure it worth the cost of the technology and maintenance . 
  this is without speaking about the `` poor '' performance you might suffer from , when facing a `` regular '' aircraft . 
  i 'm not sure an harrier was able to face an early su-27 with good chance to win . 
  ( i consciously used 2 4th generation fighters as the pak 50 capability is really unknown atm ) . 
   how hard is it to install cats and traps on the qe class ? 
  nearly impossible ? 
  it 's not only related to the carrier but to the planes used too ... 
  i always imagined it fairly hard for a catobar compatible aircraft to handle the pressure of the ski-jump . 
  plus , there is a specific prop to weight ratio to be reached by airplanes to be able to exploit that kind of take off . 
  i 'm not sure about this but i think the f-18 and the rafale ca n't handle it . 
  i actually have n't followed the reasons closely , our government was okay at first for a non-nuclear carrier , i 'm not sure it was the main reason . 
  i always wondered why the stovl was such a passion for our neighbor ... 
  sadly this project failed miserably . 
  love you all you cunts !, 
  am i doing it right ? 
  strange this did n't help us to set aside everything following those events . 
  i would have love to have more than an `` entente cordiale '' now ... 
  i have the strange feeling lately that we share more with the british than the germans ( love you guys , do n't start another ww for the best of all ) . 
   england vs france friendly there is no friendly game with our oldest rival , only test matches or real battles . 
  joke aside , i recently discovered that we had quite a good relationship with you guys during the 2nd empire ( not my favorite era ) . 
  it 's never enough hm ? 
  :p anyway , the standard rifle is being replaced now so this story will be a matter of the past soon . 
   that ca n't use the same damn rifle ammo that others can . 
  the famas g2 ( standard for the navy now ) only fires stanag 5.56 mm . 
  the f1 was n't replaced that fast ( still standard rifle for the `` arm\u00e9e de terre '' but being replaced iirc ) for economical reasons ... 
  the next standard rifle will be chambered in nato round as well , it 's part of the criteria . 
  the final decision is n't made yet but there is good chance it will be the hk416 . 
  your information are outdated by a good 20 years  . 
  if all europe join spain with a capital in spain , i 'm totally with it ... 
  yes , stupid nationalism . 
  i was also oppressed by the nazi of using french during occupation , does that count ? 
  can i be independent ? 
  i ca n't stand giving 30 % of my gdp to this socialist government that has nothing to do with me . 
  my backyard has the right to be independent !, 
  meh , i declare my apartment the independent state of pinguland following a referendum resulting with a 100 % yes . 
  i 'm oppressed by the government taking 30 % of my gdp and i highly disagree with the socialism as i prefer imperialism as my antarctica 's cousin align to . 
   stupid nationalism is the achilles ' heel of europe . 
  except that if catalunya or any other country becomes independent it will have to go through the normal process of eu integration , no exceptions . 
  the parliament made things really clear for once . 
  this process would take years ( if it success ... ) before catalunya becomes part of the eu . 
  the english crown belongs to the normandy duchy , not the other way around . 
  i thought guillaume the conqueror ( and not william ) made things clear with you guys . 
  and i want my independent country in my backyard because muh freedom i 'm oppressed . 
  those movements in europe make me sick , we only hear people whining and leave poorer people in their shit . 
  it 's stupid in so many level i ca n't stand it . 
  normandie independante !, 
  so in real , this war was for the supremacy of a whole culture ( i knew they were culturally different , but not that different ) over all italy . 
  my bad , i did n't take this into consideration ... 
  wait a minute , etruscan were not speaking latin ? 
  til . 
  this change radically my view on the conflict with rome . 
  i thought it was , basque , finnish and hungarian . 
  edit : western europe , my bad guys ... 
  like it was n't already complicated enough to administrate and push decisions in europe right now ... 
   fleur would not be here . 
  and it would be mistake , i 'm definitely not in line with those people .
