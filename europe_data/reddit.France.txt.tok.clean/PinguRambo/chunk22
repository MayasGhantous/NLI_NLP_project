  too fucking late you morons . 
  this should have happened 5 years ago . 
  why do they have to wait that much to act ? 
  good job guys !, 
   i did and i 'm more than happy to admit defeat on that point . 
  let 's use the uk as example then . 
   what do you mean exactly ? 
  i 'm not sure the status of anything there  i do n't know what to think about this , myself and all my friends ( male friends ) , had our fair share os slap on the wrist/spank for not behaving . 
  we ended up pretty well in life ( all young engineers ) . 
  i guess it 's not a good tool to avoid abuse ... 
  are you talking about spanking/slaping children ? 
  it has also been declared illegal for a few month here as well . 
  i would be ok for some consistency across europe for some crimes . 
  i do n't say for all because we 'll find the `` cultural exception '' of one country or another . 
  child abuse though ... 
  well i meant homicide by firearm obviously . 
  i could n't find the right term for that : x, 
  well , death by firearm is pretty much a binary definition . 
  see us vs europe figures . 
  not all stats are garbage . 
  could n't even recognize her . 
  and you are assessing my english level based on an interpretation of a single sentence ? 
  what a deep and meaningful way to test one 's english . 
  and i 'm telling you this sentence alone is n't that clear . 
  i really do n't understand why your interpretation of a title is more valid than mine . 
  the rest of the article is clear , and i 'm fine with what she said . 
   cooperation with eu she is speaking for the eu , here , right ? 
  and for fuck sake , i just said the headline is shitty , not the content of her speech or article . 
  you guys are really butt-hurts sometimes . 
  i 'm not sure actually , but i really read it as : merkel : `` there is no ` eternal guarantee ' for united states cooperation with eu '' . 
  when she says `` with the eu '' , i read as , `` i speak on behalf of the union '' . 
  the content of the article reflects more that it 's her position ( or idea/opinion ) or germany 's and i 'm really fine with this . 
   merkel : no ` eternal guarantee ' for united states cooperation with eu i 'm sorry but it 's far from obvious from this quote alone . 
  ** misleading title . 
  ** i do n't like the headline , which sounds like she is speaking on behalf of everyone else . 
  i do really like the content of her speech though . 
  read the paper once again . 
  are you living in europe ? 
  because it 's the new hot potato . 
  congrats guys . 
  finally concrete actions against this barbaric act . 
  thank you for that !, 
   hypocracy really ? 
  you could n't even spell it right ? 
  damn i did n't know commies were so dense ... 
  far right populism is democracy ? 
  noted . 
  it was mine as well !, 
  soundtrack bro ? 
  just so you know . 
  answered : just a small city !, 
  ok fair enough !, 
  i just wanted to understand why 2 austrians were surprised with that . 
  it 's always important to put context in news . 
  i did n't know if it was just a small city or something with a refugee camp nearby . 
  they are just teasing us . 
  it 's not like it 's a ghost town with alien research , or the location for an ancient mayan pyramid . 
  i guess , but i really want to know it from an austrian mouth . 
  always interested in actual context when i read a news . 
  but my question still stands :p what 's so special about innsbruck ? 
  true , but the partie socialiste , is unpopular as ever , it 's just a waste of time for some of those people that are leaning between the 2/3 of left candidates . 
  why is that so worse there than elsewhere ? 
  yeah , let people do justice themselves , what could possibly go wrong ... and sorry but you are curing the effect , not the root cause . 
  they will just upgrade to knife and guns . 
  i 'm more [ into this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bh63oqkdus ) right now . 
   from a moral standpoint . 
  so their ( your ? ), 
  moral is illegal . 
  you know , there are plenty of extremists who think this way , and not the nicest ones . 
  why not ? 
  and i do n't see anybody in their sane mind voting for the exiting party . 
  and especially not valls . 
  seriously , this guy is way more hated than sarkozy was in 2012 . 
  and he was the only real right wing candidate . 
  valls is n't . 
  it 's just removing voting power that should be dedicated to people that actually stand a chance . 
  i 'm not left leaning anyway , so i really do n't care . 
  i just think it 's non-sense if the left wants to stand a chance . 
  no , it does n't work like that , funds are not to be spend on whatever you want . 
  you do n't go to a strip club on business expense when you are in a business trip . 
  same thing apply here , this money is not meant for nationalist propaganda . 
  as melanchon said ( i agree with him on more topics that i care to admit ) , a socialist candidate is complete non-sense . 
  it 's now clear that you will have 2 rights ( fillon & le pen ) and 2 left ( macron & melanchon ) candidates . 
  nothing more . 
   ** eu money ** on ** national ** referenda ? 
  you have your answer . 
  this is extremely rude and not worth of a country leader . 
  i truly agree . 
  but in all fairness , could we have the same kind of data for other leader ? 
  just as a fair comparison . 
  she is a symbol from a past oppression , ca n't blame him for that . 
  for the rest of official delegations though , it 's outrageous . 
  just try . 
  where do i sign ? 
  edit : would they invite van halen for the party ? 
  oh yes we do ... we even have an islamist party who wants to veil all women . 
  for real . 
  i 'm not saying they have any chance , i just think some people are denser than i imagined . 
  and it still surprises me . 
   same for trucks interesting point ...
