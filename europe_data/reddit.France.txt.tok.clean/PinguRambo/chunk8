  thanks to you !, 
  you made the good start out of it , 
  great system , sounds like a fair deal for once !, 
  i 'm a young professional so there is not so much i can win from anything ( except maybe the tax free threshold , but i 'm not even sure ) . 
  this is simply perfect . 
  i would love to hear about ~ ~ luke skywalker ~ ~ juppe 's sister , christine laguarde who would also make a good candidate in my opinion . 
  to me laguarde would be daenerys . 
  with no question . 
  juppe is more like john snow to me , stuck in a shithole ( sorry i love bordeaux ) , the rightfull heir , that was back stabbed by his peers and promise to a brilliant come back with enough chance . 
  he is the only hope we have , i dream about him kicking sarkozy 's ass on the first run . 
  do n't worry , we wo n't forget to celebrate the death of your monarchy . 
  on a more serious note , i think it 's a good idea to celebrate all national days like this . 
  it was n't only a political prison , but also a huge weapon and powder reserve . 
  hence the name , they just got poisoned by the perfide albion ... 
  hence the name , they just got poisoned by the perfide albion ... 
  because our glorious emperor was 30m tall ? 
  i just made the swap the other way around , i 'm a bit clueless about this system . 
  care to expand ? 
  really no surprise to see luxembourg here . 
  the poorer you are the more fucked by tax you will be ... 
  combien as tu d'enfants ? 
  yeah sorry , it 's like a combination of fancy and rural french . 
  really typical of the late middle age-renaissance period . 
  ( if there is a linguist here and i 'm mistaken please correct me ) so hard to describe , but so meaningful to us . 
  for instance , in this particular case , instead of threatening people of beheading / u/tex-to-speech - device used the term `` shorten above shoulders '' . 
  it 's like raw poetry . 
  i love it !,

  oh do n't be silly , you always knew we were the favorite brother . 
  you even prefer us over them :d, 
   alors , regarde ceci while absolutely perfect and very formal we will more use a casual `` ca '' on a reddit / online conversation topic ( us keyboard no other way to write it properly ) . 
  as always , i love having people practicing , and i love when people correct my mistakes in any languages . 
  anyway , thanks mate !, 
  call me blind , but i do n't know what they are really doing bad for europe at the moment . 
  `` de l'audace , de l'audace toujours de l'audace '' seriously , it should become our maxine ... 
  why did we gave up this french already ? 
  it 's so much more badass/funny/pleasant to read ... 
  definitely agree with that , as far as i 'm concerned , the longest peace era of europe is a proof that the dream worked . 
  i sincerely hope this wo n't prevent you to play at the world cup !, 
  i talked about both ... 
  i talked about both ... 
  because heavy co2 ( besides other things ) pollution is n't creating a cataclysmic future either ? 
  sorry , i 'm a bit bitter about the situation as our politician loves to take sweden as an example while : - we have very different cultures - more than 6 times the population ( the bigger the population , the harder it is to manage ) - the model is n't that efficient apparently ( despite some great achievement i admit ) . 
  we are showing the same empathy toward criminals lately and that makes me sick . 
  what do you suggest , returning to stone age ? 
  coal particulates pollution cause approximately one million deaths annually across the world . 
  nuclear energy ? 
  oh wait , no atmospheric pollution from the energy production . 
  but you might be referring to operational accidents :  separate studies found out that during the period from 1970 to 1992 , there were just 39 on-the-job deaths of nuclear power plant workers worldwide , while during the same time period , there were 6,400 on-the-job deaths of coal power plant workers , 1,200 on-the-job deaths of natural gas power plant workers and members of the general public caused by natural gas power plants , and 4,000 deaths of members of the general public caused by hydroelectric power plants . 
  oh you may want to talk about civilian nuclear incidents , less than a hundred . 
  while coal mining death toll is astronomical . 
  still want to discuss which is the most lethal and dangerous for us all ? 
  i would love to hear your argument against nuclear energy . 
  congratulation anti-nuclear activist . 
  you are responsible for 1000s of death in the near future . 
  in your country and other surrounding ... fuck you all . 
   let 's take brutal assault gang-rapes which is a crime hard to bury in statistics because of it 's impact in the press . 
  anybody with google can check that there have been dozens of brutal gang-rapes in sweden in recent history and that such a crime is extremely rare in most other countries of europe . 
   i thought it was the most progressive nation toward women ( and everyone ) in the world ... 
  or even worse , they only are in opposition with their adversaries . 
  it was a simple affirmation , your last answer was clearly an aggression . 
  mate , do n't be condescending , i do n't know your background and you have no idea about mine either . 
  except that at the moment it 's only the former that is happening . 
  and it 's in now way better than the later . 
  edit : and come on , engineer , scientist and technician are n't stupid people . 
  they have their understanding of law and could refer to it before making mistake . 
  i 'm not advocating for one side or the other , i want people to work together . 
  i do n't want to see morons like him deciding on their own extremely dangerous idea for everyone . 
  once again , cameron wanting a ban on encryption , is the perfect example of what i was saying . 
  he just has no idea of the implication of what he wants . 
  i think it 's ** at least ** as harmful as a group of technician expert discussing the topic without fully understanding how the law work . 
  i do n't know the denmark position/culture/regulation on this point , but in france religion is a private matter . 
  you can praise cthulhu in secret , as long as it does n't interfere with your job , it should n't be a problem . 
  i know a lot of people have the crazy view of catholic religion going batshit crazy against science , but it 's not the perspective i know from european religious guys . 
  you can perfectly believe in god ( ** as long as it remains private ** ) and accept all the scientific fact given . 
  i know it 's a totally stupid reference but to me , religion should be the answer to why , not how . 
  sorry mate , i was thinking physician while writing and reading physicist . 
   ( which means that some counsellor will stop him from actually doing anything stupid ) he actually claimed that several times now , nobody is stopping him and it 's actually frightening to see that he not even well advised . 
  anyway , it was mostly a single example i used because i 'm well aware about the topic . 
  i 'm even more scared about the level of their debate when i 'm not literate on the matter . 
  and you are absolutely correct about the ideology , too many time politician take the `` right way '' ( e.g. 
  defending internet neutrality ) only as an opposition to adversaries . 
  do n't you think it 's time to break this childish game ? 
  i do n't have the solution , but starting hearing the right people might be the key . 
  oh , and one last thing , in no way i said that i 'm the right person to be heard on the issue . 
  there is plenty of brilliant mind with appropriate background in europe able to talk and debate about the problem . 
  schroeder was a physicist ? 
  i thought he was only called doctor because he had a phd of some sort . 
  anyway , i 'm still not okay letting lawyer spreading bullshit over how the energy production should be managed or how to secure our interests . 
  the simple fact that cameron stating that kind of bullshit ( i only use this example as it 's really fresh but we also have our own ) , only show how they actually do n't understand shit about it . 
  so yes , it 's apparently that hard to understand technical matters . 
  sorry but as far as i 'm concerned , i 'm disturbed by this over-representation , and i would like to see things change for once . 
  i do n't say they should be put out of the game , but i see them more as a support of who should actually debate those problem rather than the major ( and only ) actor . 
   no offence but why enginers or technicians ? 
  i get scientists or economists but technicians ? 
  are they gon na debate over preferable bridge building techniques ? 
  none taken  to illustrate my point , i will pick-up a really recent example : how come a lawyer could debate on internet regulation without knowing shit about everything involved here ? 
  cameron stating that he wants to ban encryption makes the it security engineer i am , turning into a berserk wanting to burn the world . 
  they do n't have the bigger picture , they just do n't know anything about what they are talking about . 
  i do n't believe a lawyer is knowing more than me about ethic or the potential impact of a stupid statement on a really technical topic like this .
