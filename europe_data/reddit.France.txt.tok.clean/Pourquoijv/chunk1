lol even still ... i expect that the top 4-5 teams at least did not fire managers halfway through ... that is like 15 teams 23 manager changes, 
  how many teams do you guys have !, 
  looking at twitter this feels somewhat like a cult ... if he were to organise a referendum for a life size statue of himself at the white house entrance , looks like at least 25 % of the population would say yes, 
  shit they found my surname, 
  waiting for the library of the r/europe mods, 
  theee is also rue du havre , rue de calais , rue de douai , provence and anjou too but those are not cities ... place de dublin as well , rue de t\u00e9h\u00e9ran, 
  agreed, 
  they could get something from scandinavia considering how norway gets saint-petersburg, 
  damn russia does n't even get another country, 
  when you are the greatest nation to have ever existed you need to have ego, 
  is the centre part retractable by any chance ? 
  mexico ? 
  are we getting despacito next eurovision then ? 
   best football team in the world from the late nineties to the mid 2000s . 
  * ahem *, 
  that scarf, 
  this one looks like it 's come from a fairy tale, 
  this is really nice probably my second favourite after italy, 
  yes that 's it !, 
  thanks !, 
  i think it 's the main place with the large church on one side ... there 's a statue in the middle and caf\u00e9s in another side, 
  have issues with their name consider themselves central european but that 's debatable no great beer ( only beer i like ) i also really like the place in prague but i forgot the name :(, 
  so how do we become the french ambassador to italy, 
  okay italy you win this round, 
  everything i read or watched in the past week said 120 battements or faute d'amour ( the russian one ) would win ... so yeah that was surprising ... in other news : * ramadan started * our president went to mali / g7 / nato * roland-garros started * psg won the cup of france, 
  france : we outdid a pumpkin at handshaking !, 
  proof : https://i.redd.it/je6sol8lgnzy.png, 
  yet when i try to work i fall asleep within a minute, 
  iceland 46,6 wtf that 's crazy, 
  those are some weird flag pairings ... croatia - cyprus instead of greece ? 
  lithuania - malta instead of latvia ... finland - austria instead of estonia etc etc, 
  oh then i have no idea, 
  population is 921 according to wiki so that should be around 156 police total, 
  maybe the buffer zone guys ? 
  ahh okay makes more sense that it was made for a contest, 
  oh i was commenting on the app design rather than the fact that they did n't want to `` bang relatives '', 
  omg wow !, 
  thanks !, 
   their dating apps are specifically designed to avoid banging relatives wait what really ? 
  * future vacation spot * weird d letter * many times not on maps of europe * northern lights * jb filmed a video there * oh and everyone is related to everyone else apparently, 
  # #neverremember, 
  it does n't have to be dumbed down but that 's just how eurovision is ... anyways it 's late and i do n't want to argue / discuss ... i did n't like the speech you 're welcome to do so , 
  not appropriate . 
  but whatever i did n't like the speech you are obviously welcome to do so , 
  why say it on the eurovision stage then right after they hand you the trophy, 
  it does n't matter whether his song had meaning . 
  he 's at eurovision not the orchestra ... go to a mcdonald 's and complain about not getting michelin star food ... let 's see how you do and yes i do prefer people to be politically correct instead of douches, 
  but she bought new underwear for you, 
  it was televote that they gained the points though did you guys actually like the song or just neighbour votes, 
  all of it ... 
  thoughts : * hosts were horrible * jury voting is outdated ( australia 171 seriously ?? 
  also of course sweden gets all nordic votes ) * spain was ... just i do n't even know ... who voted for them * rip iba * france / italy / hungary should have been higher * congratulations salvador ... fuck your speech, 
  so did you guys < 3, 
  it 's ukraine probably seen that before, 
  #fuck the juries you guys were trash, 
  hungary, 
  which ghetto did they find timur in smh, 
  static weepy bitch is here, 
  ukrainians : are there not three english speakers in your country who could host ? 
  yup looks like russia can participate next year then, 
  hello scary giant head, 
  i love the song !, 
  italy / portugal / bulgaria - favourites, 
  eugh i hate it ... just another ballad, 
  yes , very . 
  financial troubles, 
  can you guys somehow win so petra can re-host, 
  apparently, 
  yeah but both lose the last syllable so it still should rhyme, 
  i pronounce it similar to that, 
  nf not eurovision ... still a pretty impressive number, 
  and then we would have spain at # 26, 
  it 's about love being born and dying and centuries passing and disappearing ... basically love, 
  chorus is romani ? 
  ~ ~ rise like a phoenix / fairytale ~ ~ #lovelovepeacepeace, 
  okay i know france  italy etc etc but if francesco does n't win ... 
  rip, 
  probably, 
  i 'm not very religious, 
  on behalf of all muslims , i apologise for such crazy fucks, 
  i think even the luxembourgeois have forgotten luxembourgish, 
  well it 's the only one largely spoken here ... was n't trying to be factual or anything edit : grammar, 
  wow german is weird, 
  so why are deutsch and english capitalised but not most others ? 
  it 's very fashionable, 
  thankfully that ended ... imagine breton being the official language of france, 
  so austria was celtic ? 
  wow i never knew, 
  probably the same people who think all muslims are daech, 
  did n't think i 'd need the / s but yeah was totally joking, 
  til america is not r/t _ d, 
  france 3 % italy 2 % * hon hon hon *, 
  i 've supported macron since probably before he supported himself but le pen ( and her supporters ) are much better than anyone or anything you find on that subreddit, 
  9 votes for marine vs 2 for macron in ouanary ( 81,82 % ) source - https://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/resultats/guyane-973/ouanary-97314/, 
  macron winning by over 15 % departments that marine won the first round, 
  wow ... no words, 
  did n't trump release a video of him speaking hindi ? 
  also the newborn in the saudi royal family was named ivanka, 
  probably ... i think it 's as weird as you do, 
  macron is speaking .
