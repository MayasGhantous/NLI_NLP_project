  so that 's it ? 
  you keep spinning it in your hands ? 
  how could that possibly become big ? 
  wait what is this, 
  yes because my phone connection is dutch, 
  i just google houses in cachemire and they were similar to those idk, 
  i was oversimplifying with the `` dying off '' thing idk the climate accords are literally the only thing on the news right now ( travelling in india so watching france24 english ) so it seems like a larger problem than let 's say terrorism etc but mostly i guess the coverage 's due to the trump verdict, 
  wtf did i just read lol, 
  idk the way people are talking about it makes me feel the earth is going to die off within this decade ( honestly it 's probably because of the us thing and people are going to stop talking about it so much in a couple of weeks ), 
  yeah watching now, 
  yes i do ... but i think it is slightly less serious than what everyone is saying, 
  china / india have the himalayas there could well be something like that, 
  i do n't recognise any but ... not sure if you 've seen this https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/6ekg9l/help_europol_fight_child_abuse_id_these_items/, 
  have they officially pulled out ? 
  i thought he would decide later today ? 
  lmao, 
  ah but surely football is more popular ? 
  this must be second ? 
  where is this ? 
  edit : i just realised ( 5 hours later ) that you were being sarcastic, 
  football, 
  i quite like the british film industry, 
  great now we have a language that no one can understand, 
   people will sometimes say that italians are more african than european . 
  lol what ? 
  eh it 's called an `` overseas collectivity '' if you want to be technical but frankly i group them all together as one ( departments , territories , collectivities etc ), 
  i 'm curious now as to which insult this is, 
  i only get offended when for example i am talking on the phone ( in french ) and some tourist comes and like keeps asking me ( hey where is the louvre ? 
  ) ... probably most people would get annoyed then ... but it really helps if you said `` parlez-vous anglais '' after bonjour or something of the sort rather than bonjour i want x and y from the menu ... for me personally i would n't switch to english unless the other person asked because maybe they do n't speak english ? 
  many of my friends do n't so no i would n't be offended if you did n't because i would assume you spoke your language and learnt some french to visit, 
  well of course, 
  well that 's partly because of your history i would say : was there not a law that if you were 1/16 of one race you were considered that race ? 
  i think maybe that 's why americans are always i 'm 3/19 irish etc, 
  fucking hell i have n't taken a harder test in my life ... i did n't know what most of that meant ... i went like other / other / i have no word for this / other ... oh you speak new york edit - i did the quiz again with some different answers and same result ... k, 
  if they institute only one official language to be spoken and taught in schools ( unless it 's french ), 
  we could make him president of the e u ? 
  sicily ? 
  googled him as well ... son of indian doctor maybe that 's what op means ? 
  saint-barth\u00e9l\u00e9my if it counts i 've been there twice, 
  ah i basically take out from the washer a fourth each day and if i really need something i use a hair dryer to dry it, 
  i have about 12 i wash my towels / clothes twice a week, 
  netherlands x north sea, 
  for me it 's a country with great people whose politics the us , the gulf , and maybe other countries ( not sure on the last part ) do n't like ... and that 's why they have been vilified in the media ... 
  eh i do n't much care for it ... neither for people gender, 
  one of the american ones ... idk which one exactly probably where we get more tourists from, 
  in the us sorry but it is bloody confusing ... i was in chicago once and someone connected me with a person who was living `` in chicago '' ... okay cool messaged him he invited me to stay with him okay great when i give the address to the taxi he says it 's two hours away in a different state ... had to book a shit hotel last minute, 
  not me but a friend from very close to the border said she had spanish as the second language, 
  i feel like spanish might be more common second language than german in the south, 
  \u00cele-de-france is the region of paris, 
  only about 2 hours a day at most ( when i wash my hair longer but that 's only about twice a week ) ... it 's not about sweat i feel dirty if i do n't, 
  eh there are other countries ( likely us influenced ) that use their colour scheme ( south korea for example ), 
   far right parties had been depicted as brown , the nazi color . 
  hmm til it was n't red and black, 
  lmao do a lot of people in louisiana still speak french ? 
  in france , red / pink = ps ( left ) black and white ( i 've seen yellow used too ) = em ( centre - current party ) blue = lr ( right ) navy = fn ( radical right ), 
  french / english - fluent - learnt since i was a baby spanish - intermediate - learnt in school italian - passable - learnt in italy arabic - absolute shit ( can converse okay ... just do n't ask me to read / write ) - supposed to be native language dutch - i know a few words - dated a dutch person a while back, 
  california but i would not be happy about it and complain 12 times an hour side note : the us does political party colours all wrong, 
  not very ... among some friends yes as a country no, 
  not at all ... for me it 's my body feels less smooth / soft if i do n't shower idk, 
  i ca n't do anything without a shower :( if i 'm going out on a week night like friday then i shower four times, 
  three times a day lol ... morning / after work / before bed, 
  american ... lol even the top posts on r/france are us-related ... i do n't browse too many super-american subreddits ( like r/t _ d for example ) so it feels slightly more international to me ... r/politics is basically us politics etc, 
  you should really be fine in most large french cities at least . 
  there 's a lot of indians , pakistanis , etc in paris and i assume elsewhere ... there are muslims everywhere so that should n't be a problem either, 
  mine is in the kitchen as well, 
  i like when the portuguese speak french, 
  kind of ( paris ), 
  we have a large dirty river, 
  french onion, 
  not happy about it but not overly disappointed ... environment is not my main issue right now ... the fact that people agreed on terrorism and immigration situation makes me happier than this makes me sad, 
  banlieue = suburb but they are really terrible places where many immigrants are, 
  turkish colonisation of germany = complete, 
  personally the french revolution, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zlatan_ibrahimovi\u0107#paris_saint-germain_2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zlatan_ibrahimovi\u0107#club_2 he 's also really funny, 
  wow that 's much better !, 
  thanks !, 
  that makes sense ... i wonder how i would fare on a test like this made for europeans, 
  `` wine '', 
  social liberalism https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=57.3&amp;d=70.2&amp;g=63.8&amp;s=70.5 would have thought i was more conservative on economic issues honestly, 
  well hopefully the apartments are cheaper, 
  a lot of it is due to political turmoil ... morocco / tunisia have been more stable while we had a civil war that ended 15 years back ... there were also problems earlier right after the war etc and immigration was easier i believe as algeria was an integral part of france, 
  i have no idea ... i probably could but uber does n't bother me so probably not gon na bother honestly, 
  algeria / canada maybe / otherwise fidji / maldives, 
  maybe merkel ? 
  but we finally have someone who looks good let us have him, 
  regular uber honestly i prefer the calmness ( i hate when the drivers try to talk to you though it 's so frustrating ) ... eh i just have medical conditions for which public transport is too inconvenient ... i took the metro a few times it was too crowded too dirty too suffocating, 
  uber nowadays ... there 's a lot of traffic so no not satisfied but there are n't many alternatives ( i hate public transport ), 
  monaco definitely but hopefully germany ... that would be a great country ... we can share with them our language and culture , and they can share with us their money and cars, 
  fun fact : there are more users here right now ( 219 ) than subscribed to r/andorra ( 192 ), 
  and here i thought the entire andorran population was on reddit ... why do we not have a catalan flair anyway, 
  none * turns nose up in air * edit : removed the / s, 
  soap and a sponge ... no soaking i wash each individually ... i rinse after, 
  i do n't like it but it does n't bother me a lot, 
  for work like three times a month lol ... for pleasure maybe once a year, 
  haha i do n't care for much of those ( bicycle paths what ) but yeah paris has its problems ... berlin is pretty though, 
  linnahall looks pretty nice to me just extremely dirty, 
  the ugliest by far is the montparnasse tower http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4424328/thumbs/o-tour-montparnasse-570.jpg ... there are way too many pretty ones though, 
  i like it ( paris ), 
  eh ... not really ... it 's fine the way it is right now ... 
  i do n't care for marriages but i love weddings !,
