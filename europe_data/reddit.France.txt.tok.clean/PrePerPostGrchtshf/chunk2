  that never happens , it was timed for the elections . 
  i am qualified in eu law . 
  check http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome it is very straightforward , there is no debate about this . 
  the citizens initiative `` invites '' the ec to make a legislative proposal . 
  and guess what : 1 . 
  the eu has no competence on the matter 2 . 
  this eci does not ask for a legislative proposal 3 . 
  the ec can choose to completely ignore it . 
  it owns the right of initiative . 
  eci 's are not legally binding . 
  the ec can use them to propose legislation ( it gives them political ammo ) but in no way does it have to . 
  actually no . 
  the eu bas no competences for it . 
  this was known when writing the eci , so ont talks about `` opening a dialogue '' blahblahblah . 
  which really means nothing . 
  moreover , the ec does not have to do a proposal reflecting an eci . 
  i was part of the students who made it up . 
  it was a school project . 
  i came up with the wordplay ( that 's it though ) . 
  it has no chance of achieving anything , 
  this petition is a joke . 
  france vetoed the uk 's application for over 10 years just because why not . 
  there is no limit , why should there be one ? 
  no , she wo n't . 
  she got what she wanted . 
   important one with `` employment , social affairs , skills and labour mobilty '' lol, 
  what ? 
  i love them . 
  i 'll be so sad if there is a no ... 
  it includes filthy non-eu members though . 
  icky ... 
  needs to be more centered around central europe imo : france . 
  you better send us snow removal stuff next time it snows in france !, 
  it 's a national catastrophe everytime it happens :(, 
  actually no , you france ca n't deport its citizens , under any circumstances , unless there is a european mandate ( and the crime is punishable in france ) . 
  i do n't think a bullet would suffice . 
  maybe a silver one . 
  we make jokes about belgians , because they are not very smart . 
  they are like our retarded little cousins . 
  those jokes can involve fries , but not necessarily . 
  here are a few : ** 1 ** a belgian is sitting at a caf\u00e9 drinking coffee . 
  - sir can i get a sugar cube ? 
  - but i gave you 10 already !, 
  - it is n't my fault if they all melt in my coffee !, 
  ** 2 ** why are there piles of shit in front of some belgian stores ? 
  because it says push hard on the door . 
  ** 3 ** a helicopter crashed in a belgian graveyard ... the police found 500 bodies . 
  belgians so dumb lol, 
   f , as is most likely , the final round is between the fn and ump , then i can not see how the fn can win . 
  surely a large majority of the left will vote ump ? 
  in the less likely scenario in which the final round is between fn and ps , then i think the fn have a better shot as i think some of the centre right will go for fn rather than ps again . 
  currently it does look as if fn will be in the run off , though obviously there is a long way ahead ... 
  while it is very possible ( and likely it seems ) that le pen makes it to the second round , there is no way she would make it past the second . 
  even with the high score that she got in the european election she would be far from being able to make on the second round . 
  she is really really ** really ** despised by over 70 % of the population . 
  he is elected , albeit indirectly . 
  most heads of state are not directly elected . 
  even in france technically the head of the executive isnt elected . 
  no you do n't !, 
  while i see the point with the council ( though technically ministers are appointed by head of states , who are elected ) , i do n't think the eu commission should be elected . 
  it really is just an administration , you ca n't elect all the fonctionnaires , that 's just not practical ( and they would n't be qualified ) . 
  what needs to be done is make more people realize that their vote for the parliament does matter , consolidate the ec president as elected by parliament , and strenghthen his position in deciding who the other commissioners are . 
  it would make up a pretty standard parliamentary system . 
  which is absurd . 
  good on germany for speaking out . 
  indeed , there was some constitutional interpretation involved . 
  we had just changed constitution ( 1958 ) and there was a referendum on this topic . 
  the constitution can be overriden through referendums . 
  interesting fact : more people voted yes outside of algeria than in algeria . 
  disagreement . 
  except we 're not planning to divide ourself . 
  clearly unrelated though . 
  did n't you hear / u/pablospicyweiner ? 
   she is another person . 
  she can not influence what her father does !, 
  she might actually condemn it . 
  do you understand that ? 
  you can not be made responsible for what another person does just because you are related to him !, 
  that poor girl living the hard life in the netherlands !, 
  it clearly undermines the national justice system , it means a country ca n't apply its own law on its territory ... 
  i was just quoting our constitution . 
  also france is a much more unified entity than germany or even the uk ( if you count the whole scotlands/northern ireland thing ) . 
   france should also split into two parts what . 
  pms are bosses pretty much , the eu reps are just their voice in brussels . 
  edit : i thought you meant prime minister , we usually call parliament members `` meps '' . 
  meps do n't get to pick the sanctions . 
  you would be part of glorious bretagne , most dominant of celts . 
  or paris + garden . 
  also i just realized , bretagne is in `` celtic union '' . 
  yeah no thanks . 
  the mont saint-michel is in the wrong region !, 
  thx for nantes though . 
  yes it does ... that 's what i said !, 
  the clause was `` dormant '' , because the arrangements for its implementation had not yet been adopted . 
  kinda like for the passerelle clauses ( though i do not believe this is one ) `` 3 . 
  the arrangements for the implementation by the eu of the solidarity clause shall be defined by a decision adopted by the council acting on a joint proposal by the commission and the high representative . 
  the council shall act in accordance with article 15b ( 1 ) teu where this decision has defence implications . 
  the ep shall be informed . '', 
  now it is fully part of the treaty . 
  the point ( well , that 's my analysis anyways ) is mostly to comfort finland because it isnt in nato , and also to strenghthen the eu spy system thingie .
