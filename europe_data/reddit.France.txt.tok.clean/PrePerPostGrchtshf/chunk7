  there wo n't be any major expansion any time soon . 
  you could argue that croatia got lucky and got aboard the accession train on time , serbia missed it . 
  most of the big ones do n't want new accessions . 
  more expansion is not popular , particularly following the last expansion . 
  realistically , it wo n't even come to a point where a veto will have to be put . 
  things will just get delayed and delayed until everybody agrees . 
  i do n't think so . 
  even if you fulfill all the criteria it will be vetoed . 
  i think 20 years is very optimistic actually , 30 years is more plausible , no offense . 
  so what ? 
  it would be an even bigger mess if we got more involved in your internal issues . 
  damn . 
  so much hate =( what are we supposed to do lol ? 
  send the fucking army ? 
  like that 's a good idea . 
  it 's not like they 're gon na actually join for another 20 years ... 
  it 's missing a good chunk of bretagne . 
  including the mont st. michel . 
  fuckin normand thieves . 
  i would say more so than jean moulin or charles martel . 
  it applied three times . 
  there is very little support for that . 
  at least on the french side . 
  what ? 
  yeah , i know , i have a few friends from bucharest . 
  my problem was mostly that there were strain dogs everywhere , the streets are in poor condition , and people were generally not very friendly . 
  i did notice when i was there that there was a lot of construction on the way , so it might be nice in a few years . 
  i visited the east , i was supposed to stay 3 days in bucharest , i had paid for my room and still decided to leave the next day , i even waited a few hours at the train station . 
  sofia is beautiful though , and budapest is one of my favorite cities in europe , bucharest ... not so much . 
  i heard that transylvania is great too . 
  it 's not just the west not liking the east . 
  actually , we are third now . 
  china has more than us now . 
  [ it 's on the way ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connected-continent-single-telecom-market-growth-jobs ), 
  well ' we 're talking about treaty changes here . 
  much policy areas are handled through qmv . 
  i know i know , if you check the linked article it clearly says so . 
  i am hardcore pro-eu ( i 'll be working in the council of the eu in september ) . 
  still , it is a funny story ( particularly the fact that the question was brought up in parliament ) . 
  if anything it shows to what length eurosceptics will go to try to blame things on the eu by distorting or ignoring facts in any way they can . 
  thank you romania !, 
  the movie is great but the ending is just shit honestly . 
  i liked [ casse-t\u00eate chinois ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1937118/ ) , the third of the [ l'auberge espagnole ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283900/ ) and [ les poup\u00e9es russes ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409184/ ) trilogy . 
  actually it was mostly private individuals who owned this debt . 
  how is that related in any way ? 
  it is important to note that even where qmv is the norm consensus is the standard . 
  well , this is depressing . 
  well , in 1917 the soviets `` canceled '' the equivalent of [ 3.5 % ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/emprunt_russe ) of france pib at the time . 
  obviously . 
  it 's all subjective . 
  if you want a more accurate map , based on scientific facts , i made [ one ] ( http://imgur.com/6mgulwr ) some time ago . 
  yes it is . 
  anthg east of the iron curtain is . 
  as a french , i think it is physically impossible to look over a norvegian 's shoulder . 
  but ... like ... we got awfully close to deflation ... 
  what dya mean ? 
  you can use visa cards everywhere in france . 
  try berlin . 
  that 's not very nice . 
  do they actually prosecute arsonists that they catch ? 
  or they try to prevent people from burning it , but if you manage to do it , it 's fair game ? 
  am i the only one who instantly thought `` dead morose '' for russia ? 
  hahaha . 
  yeaaaah , not gon na happen . 
  it does n't matter so much , it would be understood . 
  belgians use some verbs in different ways , like * savoir * instead of * pouvoir * . 
  it 's understandable of course , just kinda funny sometimes . 
  i thought it was one of those cases . 
  anyways , normally you 'd use * faire * or * devoir faire * instead of * devoir * ( depending on what you wan na mean ) . 
  oh , and you got ta use * en * for places ( except for exceptions , lol ) , though if you said * dans le sud de la belgique/de la wallonie * it would be correct . 
  damn my language is fun and intuitive !, 
  there are plenty of shows that have english names . 
  more simply , france got talent would not appeal to the french audience , we often get our own traductions or changes/dumbifications in the name of shows and movies ( though still in english ) because the names are too idiomatic and just do n't ring a bell to many french people . 
  a few examples : american idol =  star academy hangover =  very bad trip not another teen movie =  sex academy etc. . . 
  the loi toulon only applies to the public sector or to private bodies when they are doing `` missions de service public '' . 
  not sure if you 're flemish , or it 's one of those weird belgian usage of verbs . 
  wallons speak funny , it 's ok though , at least * they * still speak french . 
  nope , la france a un incroyable talent . 
  i think there is a misstake , the linked page is not in a language . 
  agreed 100 % . 
  i also do n't think we should enlarge for a good 30 or so years . 
  about what ? 
  there is nothing new here . 
  hey hey , this is latvia we are talking about . 
  we have a small fortune there !, 
  except it is . 
  poor , poor swedes =(, 
  * slowclap, 
  also , i just read another article , the fine might get bigger . 
  indeed , while those banks cooperated cr\u00e9dit agricole , hsbc , and jp morgan refused . 
  the commission is still investigating , and they tend to get much more aggressive with the fines when companies do not cooperate . 
  i 'm not sure what your point is and what trichet has to do with it . 
  i never tried to defend the banking sector , i merely said euribor ( the rate at which euro interbank term deposits are offered by one prime bank to another prime bank within the emu zone . ), 
  has always been kinda bs cuz , well yeah obviously banks always fixed it and did n't really take it seriously . 
  did you know that : - ** some banks submitted the same rate for up to 67 consecutive days ( ~ 3 months ) and for all maturities . 
  ** - some contributors can provide the same rate for up to 476 days in a row ( 2004-2006 ) for jpy and 175 days for chf ( 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 ) . 
  - some contributions were clearly erroneous before 2007 : some banks were submitting quotes at 66 % . 
  they were kept in the data submitted for computing the euribor - over the last few years , some banks provided `` wrong '' quotes , with rates changing from 1.85 % to 2.87 % and then to 1.87 % . 
  ( `` fat finger errors ) oh and btw , i checked . 
  this is the biggest fine ** ever ** for a cartel .
