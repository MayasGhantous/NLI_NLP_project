  but frankly , i am no expert on the subjet , so you should n't take my word for it . 
   maybe you can argue why i should trust your paper instead of my papers ? 
  you have things the wrong way here . 
  you made a statement and backed it with a meta-analysis . 
  i challenged that statement by not saying it was n't true but that it was contradicting some data . 
  you countered by saying it is `` worth more '' which does n't mean anything by itself . 
  what you should have argued was that the paper i presented was an outlier , meaning a data point outside of the general trend . 
  but saying that a paper is an outlier is a weak argument in science , one which is used as a last resort as a scientific theory should be able to explain * all * the data if it the theory ** and ** the data are both correct . 
  otherwise , you are left with `` my theory is true most of the time , except when it does n't '' . 
  researchers do n't weigh papers , they weight theories and conclusions . 
   i think ** my ** meta-analysis in nature beats ** your ** single paper . 
  and me who hoped we could have a scientific discussion without it becoming personal and devolving into `` mine is bigger '' . 
  looks like it is n't going to happen though . 
  i do n't trust them * blindly * but i think the more studies you see , the more clear a view you have and you start to identify the group of people who are doing better science than other , like `` oh , this paper comes froms the guys who never peer-review their research ! '', 
  and `` oh , this guy adressed the issue in a study i previously read '' . 
  it does n't looks so black and white to me :  and in a new paper ( pdf ) funded by the us department of agriculture , university of wisconsin researchers have essentially negated the `` more food '' argument as well . 
  the researchers looked at data from uw test plots that compared crop yields from various varieties of hybrid corn , some genetically modified and some not , between 1990 and 2010 . 
  while some gm varieties delivered small yield gains , others did not . 
  several even showed lower yields than non-gm counterparts . 
  with the exception of one commonly used trait -- a bt type designed to kill the european corn borer -- the authors conclude , `` we were surprised not to find strongly positive transgenic yield effects . '', 
  both the glyphosate-tolerant ( roundup ready ) and the bt trait for corn rootworm caused yields to drop . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/02/do-gmo-crops-have-lower-yields ), 
   yes , but if organics and gmo were identical in performance , then monsanto and the entire bio-engineering sector would not exist . 
  this is n't that obvious . 
  the reason is that farmers have been building a dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides long before the gmo appeared and by the point of the appearance of gmo , what we called biological agriculture and used to be traditional agriculture had disappeared from developped countries for 40 to 50 years . 
  i am no expert on the subject but i know it has been argued that farmers are using gmo because they are in fact completly dependant of bio-engineering companies like monsanto . 
  personally , i think one should be cautious about both what is said by companies like monsanto and tree huggers that know shit about science . 
  a hard balance to maintain when they are decisions to be made though . 
  indeed but it is not as mosanto is going to make a 30 year long comparison study with biological field and disclose the results if they are not favourable to them . 
  it is hard to get a clear picture in what is done in that field because there is a lot ideology and money muddling the studies . 
  without entering the debate about ogm , there has been a study in america of a side by side comparison of biological and conventional agriculture and it looks like the yield of biological was about as good as conventional and yielded more money for the farmer . 
  not sure of how good the study is ( when it comes to gm , there are a lot of bad ones from each side ) but [ here is the link for those interested ] ( http://www.fnab.org/images/files/etudes/fstbrochure_rodale_institute.pdf ), 
  ok , i did n't really see the point bacause i was wondering what it does more than traditional armor , except the no ricochet part . 
  turns out its use would be hardening barracks or very exposed buildings ( like embassies i guess ) . 
  still not sure it beats a steel plate when it comes to cost-effectiveness though . 
   i 've never been one to think that the french were inferior during wwii . 
  to me , i do n't think anyone would have put up much of a fight against a full strength blitzkrieg from the germans at the beginning of the war . 
  the invincible and revolutionary blitzkrieg is not a real thing , or at least not on the scale many think it was . 
  the german army was never fully motorised , even less so mecanized . 
  only the us amry was fully motorized during ww ii . 
  only the german very tip of the spear , its panzerdivision * were * able to do blitzkrieg but they were n't many of them and in the process of attacking , they were often extremely over-extended . 
  what could and should have happened if french high command had n't been incompetent would be that every german blitzkrieg attack should have been followed by a counter-offensive and/or an encirclement . 
  the key to the german success was less in the german tactics that in a fatal flaw in the french organization : division commanders that could have inflict terrible damage by counter-attacking were n't allowed to move on their own ... basically , what happened was that the french command completly surrrendered initiative to the germans and that they fully exploited it . 
  but it was less of a case of the germans revolutioning warfare that it was a case of french command fucking just about everything . 
  now , even with a good command , we probably would n't have been able to beat the germans because of how inferior the french aviation was to the german one . 
  but we should have been able to hold them back . 
   it 's france though , love and hate are the same thing it seems . 
  :p exactly , and you know how much we * love * you , do you ? 
   what about drole de guerre ? 
  you got fucked by french high command . 
  well , if it can give you confort , we were fucked by it too a few months later . 
  mines and submarines severly limited the effectivness of the british navy in the baltic sea in ww ii , as it did in ww i. 
  see the battle of jutland where the british could n't push further despite their superior number of ships . 
   poland got sold by europe and usa to russia for 50 years we did n't sell poland over , we decided to not start ww iii the moment ww ii ended . 
  it had been [ thought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unthinkable ) but it was n't the course decided . 
  i do n't think refusing to start a war that would have killed millions is the equivalent of selling a country . 
  i would say so too . 
  historically , there been a lot of italian immigration at the beginning of the xxth century ( `` rital '' is a slang word that used to be an insult to the italians coming to france ) , followed by spanish immigration after the spanish civil war . 
  second half of the xxth century , lot of portuguese working in cleaning and building to the point where there is a fair share of ( bad ) jokes about portuguese related to this job . 
  my brother is an engineer on infrastructures projects and the portuguese builders clich\u00e9 still holds a fair share of truth . 
  then of course a lot of immigration from north africa and there is also a lot of eastern europeans working here for the higher salaries but i think it is more with the intent of sending the money home rather than settling . 
  for myself , my mother maid name is rueyfflaere which is flemish and my sister married a man named vaccaro whose great grandfather came to france from italy around 1900 . 
  and i think that many french people can relate to that if they look at their family tree . 
  the reason is , i think , that geographically speaking , france is at the crossroad of western europe . 
   you ca n't say they worked properly . 
  not really disagreeing with you here but if i play the devil advocate , i could argue that if those reforms had n't happened , the unmployment rate would have been even higher than 26.03 % . 
  what is really making economic science difficult is that it is difficult to link cause and effect . 
  i do n't * think * those reforms helped but i ca n't be * sure * . 
  it is less about the opposite because tbh , the economist is n't bad , they are doing their homework most of the time at least , which is more than most economic newspapers in my country . 
  anyway , there is a very good french newspapers called `` alternatives economiques '' ( not too hard to translate , is n't it :p ) which is one of the very few independant newspaper and going on their website , they have several good links that seem promising but sadly it is in french :( . 
  personally , i think that [ the european economists for an alternative economic policy ] ( http://www.euromemo.eu/ ) looks interesting . 
   reading the back stories of these young and bright people knowing that they will be heartlessly murdered is fucking devastating . 
  yeah , i think i will pass on that . 
  it is horrible already on an intellectual level , i do n't want it to hit on an emotionnal level too . 
  i have mixed feelings about this one . 
  on one hand , i am affraid of the consequences of not holding up on the policy of not negotiating with terrorists , on the other hand , it is also good to see politicians not sacrifice one its nation citizen to the reason of state . 
  anyway , it is good news for miss prime 's family , at the very least . 
  not a bad article . 
  i was affraid it would only present the liberal point of view of the spanish government policy but it did a good job of presenting the different points of views on the matter . 
  two things i think it should have been adressing though : * the policies that tilted a labor market even more in favor of companies might have contributed to the high level of unemployment . 
  it had been argued that french labor market resists crisis better to crisis because it is harder to lay off people , at the cost of less flexibility overall . 
  * also , the high unemployement level mean that the spanish workforce has lot of skill compared to its competitors , the german especially , at the very least on a relative scale and even on an absolute scale . 
  that in turn will damage the fiscal situation of the country in the years to come . 
  * personally * ( meaning it is my personal opinion in a field where it is hard to get a clear consensus ) , i think that unemployment of that magnitude should be avoided at all cost , even if you have to spend a lot of money in keynesian stimulus . 
  the social and economic costs of long term unmployment as well as the brain drain in the spanish youth that emigrated is in my view much more damaging than the added debt , especially when inflation is low . 
  but , as paul krugman said , we will never now because that path was not taken . 
  as it is , i am not so impressed by economic policies whose main argument in favor are `` it * sucked * really bad and now it * sucks * less and if things keep at this rate , it will go back to normal in half a decade '' . 
   a terrible deal a major nato country defense industry would have gotten 1,5 billion euros to invest in dfense and russia would have been left with two useless military ships : all the seas and oceans where they could have been deployed are controlled by nato . 
  if it comes to a war with russia , those ships would get sinked the moment they get away from the safety of russian military ports . 
  the decision of buying these ships was controversial amongst the russian military too as many felt that it was a lot of money for ships that would n't be able to challenge nato on deep water and would have rather gone for submarines instead . 
  yeah , i know of that russian general who said that could have controlled crimea in one day if he had a mistral class ship . 
  first , this is bullshit as the russians already had enough military forces to get control of crimea at the time of the push so they did n't need to land any . 
  and secondly , i am 90 % sure that comment was meant to start the shitstorm against france sale contract so that russia could break of a deal it did n't want anymore . 
  so , yeah , we really showed these russians we meant business by playing in their hand here . 
  source :  adm. vladimir komoedov , chairman of the defense committee of the state duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , said 03 september 2014 . 
  `` this will not undermine our combat readiness because this ` tin can ' will require a lot of getting used to , and will most likely come without a control system ; ** and we do n't really need a helicopter carrier vessel , ** '' and  however , some military experts doubt the need to acquire helicopter carriers . 
  an expert of the center for military forecasting anatoly tsyganok told in an interview with pravda.ru that russia does not need such a ship because it is poorly armed . 
  `` to protect helicopter carriers we need escort of cruisers and destroyers , ships of this type are designed to solve problems that the russian navy does not have ( like transferring landing troops long-distance ) , equipment of mistral is incompatible with the russian equipment ( helicopters do not fit in elevators ) , and modifications will result in additional expenses . 
  and the ships will be delivered without electronic `` stuffing '' because nato will not allow it . '', 
   president of the academy of geopolitical issues , colonel-general leonid ivashov shares the skepticism of anatoly tsygankov .
