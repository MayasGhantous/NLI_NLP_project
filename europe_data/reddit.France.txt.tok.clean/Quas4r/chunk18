   folkr\u00f6relse  arbetarklass  folkhemmet no i did n't order any of this . 
  half of my furniture already comes from ikea , i 've given you enough money !, 
  that takes too much time and is wasteful . 
  separate taps are evil . 
  how did you adapt to the crappy `` hellfire or liquid nitrogen '' taps ? 
  i 'm not in the uk anymore yet i 'm still angry at these things . 
  too much few ? 
  i 'm highly interested in knowing what are the specifics of a standard shit as defined by german regulations . 
  i think you 're right but i do n't even remember going over this subject in class . 
  i realise my french geography is quite terrible . 
  i do n't even know half of the regions by heart and i get some of them mixed up with d\u00e9partements . 
  i know more us states and canadian provinces than french regions . . 
  they did n't back out for gay marriage at least . 
  literally the one thing i give them credit for recently . 
  i checked your last link thinking `` silly you , that is in the us ! '', 
  actually , til there 's a spanish mountain range called that, 
  what . 
  go to any cinema and see what kind of movies there are . 
  turn on the radio and hear what kind of stuff we listen to here . 
  talk about tv shows with someone and see which series come up . 
  yeah we totally hate all things not french . 
  somehow you made me doubt that you really live in france . 
  you 've said very well what i 've had on my mind for a long time . 
  the third paragraph especially had me clapping in front of my screen !, 
  well i think it would be a fair trade to give up your oil if we bring you some good old eu freedom and democracy ... shit , i 'm bad at this . 
  got ta ask more advice to america . 
   if you can get a french person to like something i do n't like what you 're insinuating . 
  we french people do n't like anything , we even hate ourselves , i thought that was common knowledge . 
  suggesting we do like things is a huge insult !, 
  despite being quite staunchly opposed to fn , i would * totally * hit that . 
  to name some current ministers , i 'll go with [ najat vallaud-belkacem ] ( http://lelab.europe1.fr/photos/92d57a29dabfbcb87a9eeee4ba441b2f.jpeg ) , and [ fleur pellerin ] ( http://referentiel.nouvelobs.com/wsfile/0891343039668.jpg ) ( they do n't look consistently this good though ) . 
  from the previous government : [ rama yade ] ( http://www.gala.fr/var/gal/storage/images/media/images/actu/photos_on_ne_parle_que_de_ca/rama_yade_portrait/466160-1-fre-fr/rama_yade_portrait_reference.jpg ), 
  behold the people on the wrong side of history , endangered species . 
  the 50 's called , they want their reactionary ideas back !, 
  what about your kebab removal figures for the last quarter ? 
  doing good too ? 
   when napoleon retreated from moscow through vilnius , he wanted to take this church and bring it all the way back to paris sounds quite impractical to carry a church with you when the russians are on your ass and your soldiers are half dead, 
  for real . 
  it 's like they 're trying to deal with serious questions in a pub while the crowd looks on , and the speakers are the only ones not drunk . 
  everyone else goes yurrrrr or arrrrr or nuuuuurrr, 
  i do n't follow you . 
  what does civil service have to do with women being unfairly exempted from conscription ? 
  i wish you good luck with that . 
  shaking up an established political environment would be quite the accomplishment !, 
  so the names are randomly decided ? 
  interesting . 
  it 's even more unfair to the ones whose names come out of the draw . 
   if people care so much about equal rights then why are n't danish 18-year old women demanding to be conscripted ? 
  you have it reversed . 
  people and especially men should be demanding to remove all conscription for everyone . 
   it 's nothing more than a waste of time for most people yes , and i do n't see why you would force a select few people to waste this time and not the rest , there is no fairness in that . 
  6 months is a lot . 
  in my case , if i had been conscripted upon leaving highschool , i would have lost 1 full semester of college time and i would be returning to school life after a 6 month break from studying !, 
  i 'm damn thankful france scrapped conscription altogether , because the idea of losing 6 months of my life just for being a man does n't sit right with me . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a good thing , i 'm saying it 's hilariously inappropriate for me . 
  no french paper would have the audacity to print something so blatantly insulting , and if they did the offended would sue their ass and win . 
  i 'm actually surprised it 's not the same in ireland , you would think laws against public vilification are a common thing . 
  well i had no idea the irish had a notable engagement in congo . 
  i did n't know much ( if anything at all ) about the whole event and it was quite hard to follow everything from the pictures . 
  so there were irish soldiers , fighting katangans , but there was norwegian support , and french and belgians who fought on both sides ... what, 
  but the men have to ? 
  how is that fair ? 
  either everyone gets conscription or no one does . 
  no they 're not . 
  sitting your ass in a room and listen to army guys talk for 3 days is not conscription . 
  your comment reminded me of [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_orrozc9jh_c/tpn2w6olwii/aaaaaaaaehm/rjqo8rafyea/s1600/useless_gobshites_101123_46.jpg ) . 
  i was rolling on the floor last time i saw it , it 's still pretty funny now . 
  fyi we do have our own tabloids in france , but they 're not quite as `` bold '' as yours . 
  seeing a newspaper daring to print this on their front page is like seeing the queen performing hip hop in front of buckingham . 
  so , you actually think schools are going to show porn and everything ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  of course they 're not going to do this , that 's why the boycott is stupid . 
  for reference , here is a french [ article ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2014/01/28/01016-20140128artfig00405-theorie-du-genre-des-eleves-absents-du-fait-d-une-etrange-rumeur.php ) ( from a * right leaning * newspaper , mind you ) about this . 
  you must be incredibly gullible to believe all this fear-mongering . 
  to be clear , this is not a widespread boycott . 
  it 's mostly the far right and muslims who buy into it . 
  they think the gay-transgender-jew-lesbian are going to come to their kids school to touch their pee pees and show them porn ... you really have to be either religious or a real dumb fuck to believe something like this . 
  thanks for this because i had no idea what the fuck that was but did n't care enough to google it . 
  tl ; dr : pickles & vodka . 
  well i 'll be damned !, 
  but with all due respect to m. walesa , he took the nutty road on this one . 
  you just do n't gather in one country 2 fundamentally different people who have a ( sometimes recent ) history of being at each other 's throat , especially today . 
  people care about identity . 
  it 's not like the middle ages when royalty simply traded and exchanged pieces of land like it ai n't no thang , or just married their kids off to the neighbours to unite kingdoms . 
  when i read about this , i always wonder exactly how delusional were the people who thought this could work . 
  us kissing the queen 's ass , really ? 
  it 's like asking poland to form a reich with germany . 
  lol `` so far '', 
  says the brit !, 
  are you asking if sex ed will from now on include `` genital exploration , demonstrations of homosexual acts '' ? 
  that 's the kind of thing you hear on fox news , and it 's just as reliable . 
  extremists use this rhetoric to rally all the dumb fucks around them . 
  fortunately most of us are not this fucking dumb , we can spot such a class a bullshit when we see one . 
  sounds about right . 
  i would add everyone gets drunk in the pubs at all times , but that might just be a uk thing and not limited to london, 
   panev\u0117\u017eys - generic eastern europeans , they all wear tracksuits , eat sunflower seeds and drive old audis panev\u0117\u017eys , home of the [ eastern european men school ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uzu58n-sso ), 
   west flanders : no one understands what they 're saying , and they 're happy farmers . 
  sounds like a decent compromise . 
  you welshmen sure are a contentious people . 
  for what it 's worth , i 've found they always tried to help me even when in a rush .
