  i 'm wondering if you have been high this last decade or something . 
  europe is already not safe from terrorists right now as we speak . 
  attacks have happened and i have no doubt that more will . 
  if we do nothing to stabilise africa , we 're giving them an advanced base for european operations on a silver platter . 
  you 're terribly misguided and have no understanding of geopolitics at all . 
  if we do n't stop threats to peace , even when our country is n't directly at risk , we allow madmen to gain more power . 
  first they take mali , then they take another country , and another ... eventually they will want to take us too . 
  that 's to explain why france gets involved even when the threats do n't concern our territory . 
  also , call me a utopist but operations like the one in mali is the kind of thing i want to see our army do : defend people 's right to live free . 
  in before `` yadda yadda france only cares about its interests in africa '' , to which i answer : if the immediate consequence is protecting people from aggression , i do n't give a shit what the motivations are . 
  well , for example i would wager that the [ malians ] ( http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/hollande-gets-heros-welcome-mali-fearful-future-20130203 ) who did n't get killed , tortured or enslaved by islamists are thankful for my country intervening . 
  just a thought . 
  both buttons ( easy & hard ) direct to one same quizz so i do n't know which level i 'm playing , though i would guess it 's the easy one . 
  the only difficulties were `` republic of ireland '' and `` vatican city '' which had to be named in full unlike the others . 
  also it seems the polish flag with the coat of arms is very uncommon ( to me at least , it was the first time i saw it ) and not the best choice for this test, 
  greece you are of genius !, 
  get your head out of the clouds . 
  pacifism should always be a goal , but inaction is how you get walked all over . 
  the world is n't teletubbyland . 
  with that attitude , if no one tries to push it at all , yes there probably wo n't be progress anytime soon . 
  well then , she totally deserved it . 
  i 'm opposed to it for many reasons already mentioned by others here . 
  also the turkish general public has grown disinterested with this topic , so if even they do n't want it anymore . . 
   i honestly think french people hate english people way more than we hate you . 
  it 's not hate , it 's dissing . 
  and i disagree , judging by your press . 
  every other week there is an article about what we do wrong , how france is failing to deal with issues and stuff . 
  it 's like the go-to topic in case you do n't have anything else . 
  do n't know what to fill your column with ? 
  let 's bash the french , the old boys always love it !, 
  the opposite happens sometimes in france too but overall we 're much less obsessed , not on the lookout for everything we can criticize about you . 
   getting hammered every weekend what else will you brits do on weekends then ? 
  tell some french jokes ? 
  that 's what you already do during the week . 
  well that made complete sense . 
  i want to kill the penny now . 
  he wants to sign it ... if we give him 20 bn euros a year, 
  i thought that was already the case ? 
   the french part is more inclined to join than the german part what is there to infer from that concerning french and german mentality ? 
  i 'm not surprised that there is a linguistic divide , there always is , but both france and germany were founding members of the eu so there is a discrepancy here . 
  it would be interesting if the irish language authority ( whatever you call it ) decided to coin yes/no words . 
  that would be quite a major and useful change to the language , not like our academie francaise that creates every year a flock of strange words no one ever uses . 
   do you 've got my jumper street irish yo, 
  as much as my ocd would like [ that annoying spot in the middle of the map ] ( http://www.thomasgraz.net/glass/map-eu-2013.gif ) to be colored blue as well , i do n't think it will ever happen . 
  business ( notably finance ) is too good outside the eu for switzerland . 
  think of it : if you join and go full on european regulations , where will rich people hide all their money ? 
  out of curiosity though , what part of the population supports joining ? 
  it 's a topic we never ever discuss where i 'm from . 
   croatian ( irish ) what ? 
  and did i miss the sarcasm or you 're serious ? 
  yay pissing contest . 
  `` my corruption can beat up your corruption ! ', 
  how do you agree to something then ? 
  well duh , you must be like , the last pharaoh alive . 
  nobody speaks hyeroglyph anymore these days . 
   not even by the means of his lack of ability to cause things to become unsystematic can ... can you rephrase that too ? 
  if you let us borrow cristiano for a couple world cups ... you might have a deal, 
  do n't put yourself down , i would like to see this in my city, 
  as long as our troops do n't start bombing the shit out of everything and shoot only the militias , we should be good, 
  u/thebb is correct . 
  i did n't try to imply anything , it was just one of the words i knew for `` dead '' . 
  first french victims in the car operation , i doubt it will stop there . 
  helping an ally to carry out a un-backed peacekeeping mission ? 
  that 's why the world hates america ? 
  spying on your allies is an act of hostility . 
  and even if there were as many fundamentalists as this study suggests ( which i doubt ) , it should be our business to deal with . 
  enjoy that thirth place , luxemburg . 
  low, 
  they must all be ballin ' with the scam money, 
  they ca n't do much about it , can they ? 
  they can oppose everything they want , who cares . 
   knowing russia , they will never fully let ukraine go if ukraine joins the eu , it would n't be alone to face russia at least . 
  many things are disfunctional in the eu , but i like to think we 're a family and that we care for each other in times like this . 
  yeah , like it stops them . 
  keep it real , serbia, 
  it 's expected that one day everyone will speak english as a second language , it 's already on the tracks . 
  so half of your question already had an answer long ago . 
  this permanent cynicism is annoying . 
  you 're not telling us anything new here . 
  everyone knows 1st world powers do n't intervene out of kindness . 
  in this case i want to ask you `` so fucking what ? '' . 
  if troops can help stabilise the country then yeah go for it , as long as the intervention does n't consist of bombing everyone , which france does not do . 
  do n't encourage them . . 
  obviously they were disciples of this dojo practicing their art . 
  nice try , russia . 
  people called romanes they go to the house ? 
  this is awesome !, 
  `` those grubby hats in their drip-dry shirts , they tried to get me to mention * it * again ! '', 
  `` what , europe ? '', 
  * slap * `` we do n't say that word ! '', 
  shhhh i 'm trying to keep our club secret !, 
  now please help me out here and circulate this map on the internet . 
  [ what 's a `` europe '' ? ], 
  ( http://i.imgur.com/r2tnqn7.gif ) ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ spent ^ ^ ^ way ^ ^ ^ too ^ ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ making ^ ^ ^ this ... 
  i dare say , old chap , i expected no less of you :d, 
  wow , it has been really fast since we hit the 30 000 milestone . 
  another 10k = another survey ? 
  or that they have a french accent, 
  * fat zombies, 
  of course they do , danskj\u00e4v - oh sorry , wrong nordics .
