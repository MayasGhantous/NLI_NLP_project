  well why is eu membership an uncertainty when people universally do n't want out ? 
  ^ ^ ^ surprise ^ ^ ^ anschluss, 
  welcome to the party , netherlands !, 
  nothing changes . 
  thank you , captain buzzkill . 
  you better hope no canadian sees this . 
  hahaha this guy is considered less anti-eu than the general public ? 
  i do n't know if you 're right , but if you are the uk will get right the hell out of the eu at the first occasion . 
  -110 -110 divisions ? 
  - no , 110 swiss guards in clown suits , armed with halberds and stern looks . 
  do n't be sad , west spain is best spain !, 
  i think you mean the independant principality of rafa nadal . 
  common confusion . 
  as a french ... hummm ... all the damn yanks know where my bloody country is !, 
  how am i supposed to make stereotypical jokes now !, 
  i think you mean borat . 
  the name romania is obsolete . 
  i say , old chap , you must be quite pleased with the boys from overseas . 
  to be honest it was n't really the question here :p they were expected to pinpoint the uk, 
   asked about ** their definition of an anti-semite ** , 34 percent of all respondents indicated that ** it applied to `` a non-jewish person if he or she criticizes israel . 
  ** '' in sweden , only 21 percent of 703 respondents said non-jewish critics of israel were anti-semitic , compared to ** 42 percent of 1,137 french respondents ** wow . 
  seriously . 
  if that 's anti semitism , they must think everyone but them is a nazi in europe . 
  `` hey israel , i 'm not sure bombing the palestinians and stealing their land is very cool ... '' `` aaaaah antisemitism !, 
  help , help , i 'm being oppressed ! '', 
   it does n't sound like you really give a shit about the welfare of the child if you 're equally satisfied with the child being taken out of france . 
  what do you want us to do , genius ? 
  restrain them so they wo n't take their kids to a dangerous place ? 
  now * that * would be totalitarian . 
  as long as the kid is a minor and under the responsibility of the parents , they can go wherever they damn please if they like the culture better somewhere else . 
  that 's freedom for you . 
   every totalitarian thinks they 're acting in the best interest of the stupid lumpenproletariat except in this case , we really are . 
  having your dick cut is a religious tradition . 
  religion should be a choice . 
  babies are n't responsible enough to make this choice , maybe they do n't want that . 
  only solution : put everything on hold until the kid is responsible enough to decide for himself . 
  what is old enough , tough question , we would have to draw an arbitrary line somewhere . 
  arbitrary kind of sucks , but there is no other way and it 's a small price to pay if it lets boys decide if they want their penis intact or not for the rest of their life . 
   the israelis have a french-jewish population that grows by the hour really ? 
  i had no idea . 
  well , good riddance . 
  if they are ready to go sit on a powder keg like the middle east , just so they can continue their iron age practices , they do n't belong with us . 
  about them moving to the usa , i do n't know what you as an american think about this . 
  americans have a different take than us on religious rights . 
  personally i do n't think the american way is sound ; you have to cut the crazy early on , otherwise it becomes normal . 
  we have no obligation to endorse primitive barbaric practices . 
  in europe the rights of the individual come before whatever stupid ritual the parents ' religion wants to inflict upon her/him ; anyone who thinks otherwise is welcome to adapt or fuck off to a country more `` tolerant '' of the extremisms of religion . 
  royal heads had to drop/and we could n't just stop we made more heads roll/till we reached our goal, 
  almost , 3 times actually . 
  after the revolution there has been 2 other monarchic periods , in between imperial eras . 
  but the kings could n't hang onto the throne too much after their buddy louis lost his head in 1792 . 
  maybe it did n't get us rid of monarchy for good , but it set the country in motion . 
  without the revolution we could have ended up like the uk today : stuck with a `` theoretic '' monarch dipping into taxpayer money for allowance , and a governing body with hereditary members and catholic bishops !, 
  the brits seem more or less ok with this , but to us it would be utterly outrageous . 
  edit : made my last sentence more inclusive . 
  republican & secular tradition is very strong and shared by almost all of the french people . 
   a chamber of parliament filled with 100 or so hereditary members that 's glorious monarchy for you . 
  to solve this , heads must roll ; preferably royal heads . 
  we french people know a thing or two about that . 
  call any time for info . 
  yeah you 're right , it 's not like members with weaker economies receive shittons of eu subsidies to modernise their whole infrastructure . 
  also we let governments abuse their people in every way possible , we absolutely do n't have any system of mutual scrutiny in which every state takes part . 
  do n't come !, 
  we suck !, 
  we prefer the term * fabulous * western devils . 
   always bright and sunny in western democratic countries the uk is western , and until proven otherwise it 's a country , so by elimination the conclusion is very simple : it 's not democratic !, 
  ^ ^ ^ jk ^ ^ ^ jk ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ drop ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ monocle ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ tea ^ ^ ^ cup, 
  well , at the risk of making a bold statement i quite agree with you :d i 'm just curious to know what the gentleman above might have against this operation which was pretty much a slam dunk . 
  hell no fuck that , i 'd rather leave europe completely , or worse : become ... * british * !, 
  argh now i have to wash my mouth . 
  i 'm not decided on lybia , but what 's not good about mali ? 
  they lick his boots . 
  i volunteer my body to help women who want to save energy . 
  that 's surely why russians are so comfortable with the idea of ukraine joining . 
  shut the fuck up israel . 
  you 're committing more racism and human rights violations than any of us . 
  yeah well your weather sucks !, 
  enjoy your rainy summers and your rosbif skin on our beaches !, 
  ( i retaliate with what i have ... ), 
   eussr i like that , maybe we can steal the totally kickass [ soviet anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u06jlgpmtqs ) and write our own version . 
  after all this fruitless waiting there is probably no one there that still wants it , not just him because he 's nuts . 
  and i 'm ok with that . 
  in several articles posted here or maybe another sub . 
  you must have missed them , but he does like to say we 're fucked quite often . 
  hey , an article by paul krugman that does n't say france is doomed in the title !, 
  let 's check it out , maybe . .  the real nature of the problem with germany 's failure to adjust , and how this relates to europe 's dangerously low inflation rate . 
  well , fuck . 
  did n't even make it past the second line . 
  you do n't even try , paul . 
   his government receives intelligence on what goes on in these apartments . 
  well this sounds serious , i wonder what that might be . 
  do you think they mean ... the satanic sexing ?? 
  luckily erdogan is here to save these poor students from getting laid !, 
  thank god for religious morals . 
  want some easy readership ? 
  let 's take a look at what the french are doing wrong , the chaps will love it . 
  no mandatory shower is the best . 
  such freedom . 
  how does getting rid of their passport help ? 
  you need one to cross borders and get to sweden , no ?
