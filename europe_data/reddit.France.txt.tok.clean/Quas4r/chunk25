  oh damn , henry burnt himself bad on this one , even here . 
  i do n't even follow football and i thought if he had any honor he would have come clean . 
  another proof that football needs more video refereeing . 
  i love the soldier 's song as well , actually i 'm biased towards everything irish . 
  question : which language do people use to sing it , considering most do n't speak irish ? 
  do they only learn the lyrics to the anthem so they can sing it ? 
  i 'm very jealous of scotland for this reason , they have an excuse to bring the bagpipes at every large sport event and the sound just pumps up their players and supporters . 
  hell , it even pumps me up even when i root for the opposing team . 
  i can vouch for la marseillaise ; its lyrics are definitely quite violent but it 's the memory of a founding moment of the republic , when the people united against tyranny . 
  i think it 's fitting for an anthem and an image that deserves to be remembered . 
  well , i 'm moved . 
  i could n't think of anyone who would sing in such circumstances , but i 'm happy to be proven wrong !, 
  to be clear i do like the tune of many foreign anthems ( the scottish , italian , american , russian and german being among my favorites ) , but i do n't think many people would sing/hum along to an opposing team 's anthem . 
  it 's a great gesture of sportsmanship . 
   although probably not the most hated , that dubious honour is probably french woah , where did that come from ? 
  have you never heard any girl talking about how french accents are sexy and how smooth the language sounds ? 
  i do n't want to sound too defensive but it 's like saying russians ca n't handle their liquor , you got the stereotype wrong . 
  france to uk ( london ) ** how difficult was learning the language ? 
  ** i was fluent before coming . 
  ** any hostility ? 
  ** none whatsoever . 
  ** do you feel integrated ? 
  do you have a timeline on when you will ? 
  ** london is possibly the most cosmopolitan place i 've seen so i was able to blend in and integrate quite easily . 
  ** how is your new country better/worse than your old one ? 
  ** i liked the diversity and how lively the city is , there is always something going on . 
  pubs everywhere , that 's nice . 
  on the negative side i noticed i was much more pressured into spending more than planned ( pushy sales staff , always a ton of `` options '' you can add to your standard purchase ... ) , it got annoying fast . 
  also the food , brits ca n't food . 
  ** are you planning to settle ? 
  ** actually my time in london finished last week and i 'm now back home . 
  but i have hopes to find work abroad after graduation and london is definitely a strong contender . 
  ** how difficult was it to gain employment in your new country ? 
  ** i had my internship before coming , it was not hard to find at all as it was an unpaid position and the boss just wanted to fill his office with little to no regards for qualifications ( decent english was the one big requirement ) . 
  ** any things you wish you knew before you left ? 
  ** everything about oyster cards . 
  the london transport system is pricey and will try to steal your money every chance it gets !, 
  ** is the quality of life better in your new one ? 
  ** not really , being unpaid i had to make a lot of sacrifices on housing and food . 
  ** do you find the culture overwhelming ? 
  ** it can be at first , but after a little time it became more inviting and absorbing in a good way . 
  ** how difficult was/is it making new friends ? 
  ( with other emigrants and also the natives ) ** i lived with other foreigners , went out and became friends with foreigners . 
  a kind of `` together in this '' bond , as we were all outsiders working not so great jobs but enjoying the city . 
  we ( foreigners ) were all over the place and i felt we meet people very easily within our own group . 
  local brits , however , were `` invisible '' during my stay . 
  apart from my boss ( who i had a business relationship with ) , i did n't get close to any local and it 's my main regret . 
  ** what 're your future plans ? 
  ** i must now complete my degree , and like i said i really want to work abroad , so i will keep london in mind and seize the occasion when i get one . 
  ** what were your reasons for moving ? 
  ** mandatory internship abroad as school requirement . 
  in french too ; `` prout '' is colloquial though ( real word is pet ) . 
  funny how 2 seemingly unrelated languages transposed something into a word through the same onomatopeia, 
  you `` hope this wo n't be offending '' ? 
  when is despise not offending ? 
  how ... how does one prove he is gay ? 
  `` sir , you are now going to watch hardcore gay porn , while we monitor the size of your boner '' . 
  i 'm just coming back from a 5 months internship in london where i made no money at all ... yay business friendly environment ... 
  i would be so pleased if bulgaria could answer `` lolnope '' , it 's none of russia 's business what happens in bulgaria . 
  but then again i guess this is a case of defaced public property so there is ground for charges . 
  i would rather not ... 
  i already majorly spoiled myself and i do n't want it to happen again !, 
  started bioshock infinite yesterday , raked in at least 6 hours of gaming today . 
  it 's now 2 am , i 'm going to watch silly videos for a bit before going to sleep and doing it all over again tomorrow . 
  holidays , guys !, 
   first getting stunned by an electrical stun gun is n't it specifically stated in the `` halal rules '' that animals mus n't be stunned ? 
  * man . 
  and it has nothing to do with it . 
  you have no argument , come back when you have learnt how to debate . 
   it is not the veil that is banned but covering your face ( ie it is nt ( only ) targeted at muslims ) yes , their fancy wording did n't fool anyone as to who the law was targeting . 
  a sad piece of democracy really, 
  still more reliable than some guy on the internet, 
  i have to admit , some stats surprised me and make me very proud of my country . 
  if you mention fran\u00e7ois le fran\u00e7ais ( bleuuuuu blannnnnc rouuuuuge ) i will throw in [ super dupont ] ( http://cweben.free.fr/images/superdupont-we-need-you.jpg ), 
   the irish do n't partake in silly francophobism and for this i respect you guys very much . 
  it 's easy to jump on the bandwagon but the irish do n't do it . 
  why ? 
  it 's just a shopping center . 
  of all things french , the `` only one you want in your country '' is one that is really not unique at all . 
  i do n't understand you . 
  that was beautiful , i did n't expect this at all . . 
  yes , like we do n't get enough shit already !, 
  that would be so much fun !, 
  what really matters is how true do you think this is . 
  oh my ... she looks like an ugly wax model . 
  or a badly taxidermised corpse , i ca n't decide . 
  yep , her pathetic `` damage control '' attempt made her sound like an even bigger homophobic cunt . 
  should have kept her mouth shut . 
  you do n't frighten me , english pig-dog !, 
  go and boil your bottom , son of a silly person . 
  now go away or i shall taunt you a second time !, 
   the joke will die out eventually ... hahahaha are n't you a funny lad !, 
  let 's be serious here . 
  the americans ( and brits too ) will ** never ** stop saying it . 
  oooooh what a burn !, 
  which in my opinion is a fecking cool symbol . 
  i even got a guinness t shirt just so i can wear one . 
  ^ ^ also ^ ^ i ^ ^ like ^ ^ the ^ ^ beer ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ lot, 
  you 're god damn right, 
  it would have worked like a mix of matter with anti-matter .
