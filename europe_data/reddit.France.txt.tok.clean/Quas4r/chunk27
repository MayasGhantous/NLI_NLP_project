  chunnel . 
  what an interesting word . 
  * chunnel * !, 
  thankfully my agreeing with an irish is not frowned upon . 
  is that such a bad thing ? 
  they commited major fuckups in the past like rwanda , but these days they do n't do much apart from protecting the french expats and peacekeeping . 
  i think the countries where it happens could use the help . 
  they 're far from being as stable as the former soviet countries , to say the least, 
   even the french are largely off it implying there are still places where it 's not the case ? 
  if you 're thinking of africa i disagree , france still has a `` sphere '' of influence as you say , but it 's nothing comparable to what russia does . 
   when italian police/army `` accidentally '' crosses their border to remind them who 's boss or by negligence ? 
  also , i ca n't decide what is coolest between power rangers and regent captains . 
  how do you make that fit on a business card ? 
  guys !, 
  i think i got one here , get her !, 
  i would assume their stance on gay marriage motivated quite a few retarded catholics to demonstrate in my country ... 
  so we meet again , cbfw86 [ what kind of a nick is that ? 
  is it welsh ? ], 
  i vaguely remember arguing with you over something . 
  but yeah , we can most definitely agree that the pompidou center is shite . 
   the french i stopped at this one too and i still do n't get it . '', 
  any suggestions for making / r/europe better , or comments in general ? '', 
  '' the french '' i do n't know if i should be flattered or offended ... 
  we should do this for every survey , we could reach a more representative number . 
  only 2000 answers for a subreddit of 30 000 is quite disappointing to me . 
   the beaubourg is so ugly it 's unreal yes !, 
  for a second i even thought `` wait , it 's still under construction ? 
  what 's with all the scaffolding '' before remembering * that 's how it is supposed to look ... *, 
  this sounds great , but it looks like it could be abused easily by someone who gets a hold of your phone behind your back, 
  you 're now on the nsa watchlist for using terrorist keywords `` freedom '' , `` democracy '' and `` weather '' . 
  wow , that 's not secret-y at all , they do n't even hide anymore ? 
  straight up `` you 're suspected of hating democracy and freedom , we have a few questions to ask you '' ? 
  5 years ago they would have had the decency to stalk him more discretely . 
  this is bullshit of course , but i 'm confused by the title ... how were they `` checking his political leanings at his door '' ? 
  who are the people wearing caps at the end ? 
  some sort of loyalist militia ? 
  ventre saint-gris !,

  where else ? 
  would slightly less shitty african countries be keen about taking in immigrants ? 
  hey italy , wan na play immigrant ping pong ? 
  you bring them in and let them pass , then we send them back . 
  you get the point if they do n't disappear on your side of the border . 
  look , it would be nice if were able to help everyone and give free money handouts to every poor person of the planet , but we just ca n't . 
  what aka_sotof said in the big comment above makes sense . 
  poor countries rely on rich countries to get help , and if our own countries collapse we wo n't be able to help anymore . 
  also , i do n't know why you are upset that we put our people ( europeans ) first . 
  everyone does that , you included . 
  if you tell me you would rather help a stranger rather than a family member , either you 're a liar or you have one messed up family ... 
  this kind of `` industrial tourism '' where everything is processed and fed to you from a conveyor belt is very popular with the chinese right now . 
  when their middle class gets richer , they will get into a better quality tourism : more personalised travels , where they venture somewhere in smaller groups and make their own experience . 
  a nice cup o ' brainwash for breakfast every morning will do that to someone . 
  it 's the only country with a position of `` co-prince '' that i know of . 
  that being said , the french president does basically nothing for the management of the country so i would say he does n't really count . 
   luis barcenas , aka luis el cabr\u00f3n hahahaha i love straightforward nicknames :d, 
  the lines divide the land considering which capital city is closest .

  oh you portuguese , always a good money joke despite the grim situation :-), 
  i think sphks and myself are both surprised and sorry for the poor intelligence agent that has to watch for hours a 2/3 empty room where a few old men discuss boring laws , while a few others take a nap . 
  spanish is a romance language like french and quite big in the world , as such it is very popular . 
  maybe more than english ( but i 'm not sure if it 's more widely spoken , as english is possibly the easiest language to learn ) . 
  german is very far third . 
  in middle school we all have to choose between this and spanish for our second foreign language ( the 1st being english ) , and most people go with spanish for the above reasons . 
  german makes sense economically , geographically and it 's quite a wanted skill here , but it 's just too hard to learn and to practice for us ( also it sounds angry :d ) . 
  i 've taken 7 years of german , yet today i ca n't hold a simple conversation without stopping every 3 words . 
  italian i think is a quite popular optional language in highschool . 
  it 's what i did , and after only 2 years i already spoke a better italian that i speak german today after 7 years ... this should tell you something hahaha after , it 's the `` up and coming '' but unusual languages like arabic , russian and chinese that are popular but it 's quite difficult to study them in the secondary cycle . 
  i probably forgot many others but the big ones are here . 
   is it not important to speak pretty standard-english for jobs and studying ? 
  well , not always ... it 's gaining importance every year , but there are people who just are n't interested in jobs where they would have to deal with foreign languages . 
  they are just fine with remaining in france so they ca n't be bothered to learn stuff they think they wo n't need . 
  i know small entrepreneurship is big in france , so when someone plans to create their own business from scratch and probably stay local , i can see why they would n't bother . 
  except if they want to be in new technologies . 
  if you 're looking for classes in english here , you 're going to have to go for specific fields . 
  for example my case , i 'm 3 years into my 4-years business degree , and i had classes in english for the first time this year because i chose `` international business '' . 
  fortunately english is becoming prominent in more and more fields now , and coupled with this recent `` legalisation '' in universities it 's going to become harder to avoid , even for lazy people , 
  now i 'm curious to know why they take so long to explain it . 
  it seems pretty straightforward to me , what else is there to say apart from `` run the fuck away and call the police '' ? 
  it 's the school system that has ** a lot ** of room for improvement mostly . 
  a secondary factor can indeed possibly be a form of protectionism in cinemas and on tv , productions in original language are uncommon ; the result is we are not as exposed to english as we could be . 
  but even then , we can blame this on the small number of people who have control over the audiovisual industry in france , this is not something we consciously partake in as a people . 
  we could say that the french lack motivation to learn languages , but it 's apathy and not active rejection . 
  i have honestly never met anyone with a mentality along the lines of `` ha , we french people are too good to learn other languages . 
  english is for lowly peasants ! '', 
  i think the french you met here are the kind of self-bashing people our country produces `` en masse '' . 
  we definitely have our pride to the point of sometimes being arrogants , but being proud of willfully remaining ignorants is a level of stupidity i ca n't conceive for us . 
  if you think many of us are bad at languages because we are `` too proud '' of our own , you are terribly misled . 
  what the hell is this about ...

  i think he 's choking . 
  pat him on the back . 
  easy , ask around you `` when was the last time you ate horse ? '' . 
  i do n't think i have even * seen * horse meat in my last 5 years of shopping , be it in malls , grocery stores or butcheries . 
  or just make a google maps search on any part of france you want with the word `` boucherie '' , then a new search with `` boucherie chevaline '' , you will see 95 % of the dots disappear from the map .
