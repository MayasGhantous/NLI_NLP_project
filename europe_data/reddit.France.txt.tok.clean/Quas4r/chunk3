  there you go , / u/houad posted you the cadillac ad . 
  so apparently we 're not willing to slave away at three jobs with little holidays , all for the purpose of being able to afford an unnecessarily massive car . 
  how silly of us . 
  seriously , such ads are probably few and far between , but still it 's coming from a major american corporation . 
  whose name was given in tribute to the french founder of detroit . 
  the best part is that this ad also sparked outrage in the us , because the average americans who do slave away at three jobs with little holidays are n't exactly doing that with the end goal of buying a massive cadillac . 
  problem solving in the eyes of a gambling pragmatic . 
  why do you have to make it about war ? 
  we can stick to exchanging economic punches and overused national stereotypes , stiff upper lip , gallic shrug and ... whatever it is the germans do . 
  you know , like peaceful people . 
  where is the love , man . 
  ^ ^ the ^ ^ love . 
  ^ ^ the ^ ^ love . 
  somewhere between that and `` wtf '' . 
  i guess that 's what we call morbid curiosity . 
  sunday roast is more than just this . 
  i 'm not sure how i feel about this ... 
  holy mother of clogged arteries . 
  i still kind of want to try it though . 
  yes , except maybe for `` french toast '' which is a more or less accurate designation for [ pain perdu ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3i9gorrfdyw/us5zaivsxsi/aaaaaaaaa1m/f0wlcqsyyr4/s1600/pain+perdu.jpg ), 
  i think it 's some highly advanced british sarcasm that we 're not quite getting yet . 
  note that they made sure to precise * continental * europe :d i do n't really blame them for that though . 
  jesus christ , they are dipping this innocent pizza into a pool of greasy unnamable filth . . 
  what the hell is this , is it even remotely related to us and can i eat it without dying from a heart attack ? 
  down with this sort of beans !, 
  i used to think the americans messed it up by mistaking walloons and their fries for french , but recently i read that `` french fries '' rather refers to the style of cutting the potatoes , `` frenching '' . 
  not that we have a patent on cutting vegetables in thin sticks either . 
  bring your complaints to the us department of hastily naming foreign things . 
  i do n't know too much about polish food , but i had the occasion to try pierogis , kielbasa and zurek . 
  all three are my favorite polish foods . 
  what about * fried * kebab pizza , is there such a thing ? 
  if there is , i 'm quite sure we would owe this shining example of `` adventurous gastronomy '' to the scots . 
   you can find a wide range of delicious food in most british cities . 
  ah yes i 'm aware of this theory :p seriously though , since you do have some good stuff of your own it is pretty funny that you would mention an essentially indian dish above everything else . 
  ... that is next level stupidity . 
  it will always amuse me how brits consider tikka masala a national dish :d, 
  except the elites who were `` more equal '' than the rest , as usual . 
  you 're right , i did completely forgot about sarkozy 's union for the mediterranean and yet he was my president . 
  to this day i have no clue what this union is supposed to do . 
  when they 've been saying we are on our way to hell for years it just becomes funny . . 
  i know what i 'm talking about . 
  she gathered enough popularity to become influential in french politics , which was not really the case before , but not enough to win . 
  it 's not unlikely that she could advance to the second turn in 2017 ( not 2022 ) , but if she does then * everyone * that is not among her supporters will unite to block her like they did in 2002 , it would be a 70/30 split at the minimum . 
  well , to be fair the british press does have a tendency to declare we are doomed pretty often , so i understand why when they publish a legit article about our economy 's flaws the impact is diminished . 
  it 's the boy who cried wolf , in a way . 
  she can make the second turn but never president . 
  period . 
   `` it was n't easy for him in france , '' he told russian newspaper mk . 
  `` there , society is corrupted and does n't have any moral principles '' oh boy , please keep going i have n't laughed this hard in ages !, 
  what the fuck am i looking at ? 
  russian special forces at training ? 
  welcome to the club . 
  i could have sworn our numbers were higher . 
  phew , i was worried but you actually have legitimate criticism . 
  as for the mistral deal itself , unfortunately this kind of thing will only stop happening if the 1st world decides to renounce the massive cash flow or if dictatorships become peaceful . . 
   adequately dealing with the kidnappers after the hostage has been released . 
  when does that ever happen , seriously . 
  kidnappers almost never get caught . 
  i swear , if this guy is trying to bring up the phoney war like an idiot , i 'm going to be very , * very * annoyed . 
  maybe i 'll even shake my fist . 
  i could tell his accent was great in italian , german and english but i was blown away by the french !, 
  this guy really is impressive . 
  wow , what a. . . gracious person !, 
  northern spain aka tobacco kingdom in france, 
   he 's certainly better than the last two pms we 've had ( especially the second last one ) . 
  alright i have to post [ this ] ( http://itellsya.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/daily-star-231110.jpg?w=590 ) . 
  never fails to make me laugh even if i 've seen it so many times . 
  well , it 's easier to be isolated when you have small borders and a huge pile of money to secure them ... not to mention a favorable geographic location , stuck between mountains in the middle of bigger and more accessible countries where it is easier to immigrate , drawing immigrants away from switzerland . 
   none of your qualifications of switzerland imply it would be advantageous to be isolated no , my qualifications imply they have * the means * of being isolated . 
  switzerland is tiny and full of cash , also not a target ( i believe ) of massive illegal immigration . 
  an exception , not the rule . 
  mystery solved , thank you . 
  i should have phrased my thoughts better . 
  i do n't think they should have waited to deal with bigger things before this ; there would always have been bigger things so gay marriage would never have come on the table . 
  basically the way i see it is this : the government had the occasion to do it , that 's good and i would n't have it any other way . 
  it just does n't mean much in the perspective of all the problems we have . 
  no shit , really ?!, 
  seriously , i wanted to know how on earth being francophone means that he likes france . 
   that 's a courageous decision , that is sacrificing the gvt 's popularity . 
  no , hollande campaigned on it and delivered ( for once ) what he promised ( and what we expected ) . 
  he had the majority supporting him on this , which is rare enough these days . 
  he destroyed his popularity quite thoroughly but not with gay marriage . 
  i had no idea , that 's interesting . 
  i guess if all the big clubs agree fifa really ca n't win . 
  what i meant was that the country would n't have blown up without gay marriage . 
  unemployment , education , investment ... are more pressing matters . 
  i 'm happy that we fixed this injustice of course , and it was long overdue , but it 's not the kind of change that can turn a country around . 
   liking france tell me where the above comment implied that . 
  pretty clever . 
   the response to this from real madrid , barca , united , munich , chelsea , etc will likely be the civil war that was threatened for decades explain ? 
  fran\u00e7ois ~ ~ netherlands ~ ~ hollande is our president . 
  i think i speak for a majority of us when i say he was elected out of opposition to sarkozy rather than real support , plus the fact that the original socialist candidate , [ dsk ] ( http://cache.20minutes.fr/img/photos/20mn_indesign/2011-10/2011-10-18/article_1810-cul-dsk.jpg ) ( not actual picture ) , was ousted following the shady and infamous sofitel case . 
  as for his presidency so far , the polls speak for themselves : he 's a major disappointment , seen as `` soft '' ( his nickname is [ flamby ] ( http://a141.idata.over-blog.com/300x210/4/92/49/53/flamby.gif ) ) and unable to take useful decisions by many people , despite a few token good actions ( among which gay marriage ) of little importance and his apparent willingness to go kill islamists in the desert which clashes a bit with his personality . 
  his critics also say his presidency is socialist in name only . 
  compatriots feel free to expand/correct this, 
  and * aqueducts * ... 
   not even people in the tourist office would use english bullshit , you do n't get hired in such places without speaking a bit of english . 
  my guess is they did n't speak * enough * for you to have a conversation , which is bad but not rude at all . 
  even assuming you 're being completely honest and they refused to speak english with you , why in hell would they do that ? 
  what 's the point ?
