  either you 're a troll or you 're clueless . 
  that 's too bad for your experiences , but the food culture has n't gone anywhere so i think saying `` france is not a good country to eat anymore '' is a tad dishonest ... 
  if we do n't have good food i do n't know who does . 
  also , what the hell are `` dining ranks '' ? 
  first time i ever heard about it . 
  please link, 
  not sure if bantz or serious . 
  why would you say that ? 
  being able to dump shit on the floor is a freedom i gladly renounce . 
  too bad many smokers have no such respect . 
  this is n't really connected to what i wrote ... 
  france is in the least free category for both alcohol and food . 
  this index claims to `` identify the worst places to eat , drink , smoke and vape '' . 
  yep . 
  they have been called offensive and racist long before the attacks . 
  they 're not racist , but being offensive is what they aim for . 
  they have n't cranked it up , it 's just business as usual . 
  lol , no . 
  every satisfied customer gets 50 % off on their next purchase of an explosive device !, 
  ( receipt required upon purchase . 
  discount not available from heaven . 
  does not stack with other current offers . ), 
  offensive , wtf are you talking about ? 
  it 's not like op wrote `` alsaciens are literally germans '' . 
  it is a fact that german is more widely spoken in alsace than anywhere else in france , and it 's not a bad thing either . 
  how sensitive are you that this innocent post makes you go full force `` germans out of my alsace , 1939 never 4get '' ? 
  i 've seen such maps before , they use these same words for damn near everything . 
  it must be all about the emphasis . 
  crafty africans !, 
  bro chill, 
  wine is tool of capitalist pigs . 
  we now acknowledge vodka is superior drink for all true sons of mother frantsiya . 
  walked right into that one, 
  is it right to say that brussels municipalities are like arrondissements in paris ? 
  5th republic since 1958 , what 's your point ? 
  when i search brussels in google maps , molenbeek is included within the city limits which would make it a neighbourhood . 
  but when i look up the wikipedia page of molenbeek it says it is a `` municipality in the brussels-capital region '' . 
  i 'm confused , how can it be both ? 
   buying french is like buying . . mcdonalds come on . 
  i 'm not going to pretend that french wines are the nectar of the gods and that all others pale in comparison , but you 're full of shit . 
  you do n't seem to understand me so i 'll rephrase : i respect that monarchy is the will of the british people . 
  does n't mean i have to like monarchy . 
  i will always think it 's outdated bullshit . 
  it matters to me as a republican . 
  i 'm entitled to a negative opinion on monarchy even if i 'm not british . 
  at least your president 's position is n't hereditary . 
  ~ ~ officially yes , in practice they do everything uncle vlad says . ~ ~ seems i was wrong , good for belarus that they 're making a stand . 
  ye of little faith ... 
  happy to be of service . 
  if one more person knows the truth thanks to me then i 've done my duty . 
   jews are behind buildelberg , multi culti , bankers , 9/11 , iraq , liberal agenda of destroying traditional way of life and family , cia and mossad are behind every conspiracy of course you would believe this ... that 's what the lizard people want you to think !, 
  i explained precisely what it meant in my 3rd paragraph . 
  read instead of assuming . 
  you apparently ca n't read . 
  i wrote `` 10 criminals stay alive '' , not `` 10 criminals walk free '' . 
  no matter how thorough the checks are , if death penalty is applied innocents will lose their life ; i would rather have 10 criminals stay alive than one innocent die . 
  you can see that in the us with their joke of a justice system and the several cases of people proven innocent after their execution , or cases with dodgy evidence that still ended up proceeding with the sentence . 
  not to mention the cost of the death penalty for the taxpayers , which ends up being very high since the system allows for a lengthy process of appeals . 
  i do n't see why we should allow these things to happen . 
  with life imprisonment as a capital punishment we have the best of both worlds : actual criminals are still removed from the population permanently , innocents convicted by mistake get the time for new evidence to appear , they can live with the hope of getting out and their family does n't need to go through the pain of seeing them killed for nothing . 
  targeting known isis positions is `` randomly bombing muslims '' now ? 
  well fuck me . 
  plus it 's not like the paris attacks triggered french actions , that has been happening since 2014 before even charlie . 
  you 're talking about the mona lisa ? 
  i thought everyone knew it was bought by fran\u00e7ois i. 
  wtf, 
  i thought that too about the scottish referendum , i just * really * wanted them to vote out to see what happened . 
  in hindsight , i realised that it was pretty irresponsible to hope for world-changing events just for the hell of it/curiosity . 
  maybe start by ** having ** a production to begin with before worrying about being the best . 
  hehehehe whatever you say :d, 
   i constantly ** see people say ** french people mock you if you try and speak to them in french yup . 
  it 's cool to hate us , so people online just assume negative rumors about us are true , and spread it themselves . 
  do n't take it personnally but i find comments like yours depressing ... it seems that no matter what we do or how our society changes we will always be seen as `` assholes until proven otherwise '' . 
  algeria used to be considered an integral part of france . 
  we know how well that went . 
  you know the undecideds go for the status quo . 
  we may not be very happy with the eu right now , but unless they announce something outlandish like `` all immigrants get complimentary house and car '' we will not leave . 
  we are a founding member of the union and more in line with it than the uk , which always kept some distance even after joining . 
  do n't hold your breath . 
  this article also shows a majority of 45 % for staying , 33 % for leaving and 22 % undecided . 
  that 's just ridiculous . 
  the only part i agree with is the subway smelling of piss . 
  for the rest you 're spreading misinformation . 
   with overdone emotional appeals ? 
  that 's not a great quality with which to define your movement if we get something objectively good out of it , i really do n't give a crap . 
   i 'm not making that argument and never did i did n't say you did , i showed you a similar situation in which emotional appeal worked . 
   do you agree with france 's new surveillance laws ? 
  no , but that was the government doing their own thing , not popular will that demanded it . 
  plus the gay marriage situation was * objectively * clear cut : either you were for it and right , or against it and a bigot . 
  are you serious , local government openly uses public money for this ? 
  it 's insane . 
   however , people are far too emotional about it in my opinion it 's the only way we can get this thing banned at last . 
  when france was in the process of passing the gay marriage law , those who opposed it all used the argument that `` there are more urgent things to deal with , what about jerbs ?? '', 
  as if we should n't touch gay marriage before we fix the job market . 
  this here is the same situation . 
  underage male circumcision is n't the worst thing in the world , but it 's an easy fix and if we can get it banned it will do some good . 
  if a discussion starts around it , then it will be the right time to be emotional and passionate so that it can be written into law . 
  right . 
  how complicated can this be ? 
  impressionable young girls being pressured by their family is not like adults being targeted by a cult that asks them to join .
