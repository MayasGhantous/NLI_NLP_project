  if you think trump is going to do anything because some obscure newspaper in europe is mean to him , you probably do n't have a very good grasp of reality . 
   i call this behavior bullyism , only beat who 's weaker . 
  remember when ch literally made fun of the people who * actually * shot up their office ? 
   when if . 
  do n't commit the same mistake as clinton supporters . 
  tremendous humour . 
   no war with russia where does this argument come from ? 
  you too , make your own british tabloid headline with the [ daily mail-o-matic ] ( http://www.qwghlm.co.uk/toys/dailymail/ ) !, 
  the first one i got was ** could the french give british sovereignty swine flu ? 
  ** could n't have wished for a better one . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ yes ... ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ shhhh, 
  [ me itt ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/006/077/so_good.jpg ), 
  are you really uninformed about what collaboration was ? 
  there is nothing wrong with trying to not get killed , in fact that 's what most people did all over france . 
  however some french people went `` above and beyond '' . 
  for example by reporting their neighbors for being jews or resistants , or by willingly joining the militia to happily take part in the oppression of their own people . 
  those who did such things were traitors and they deserved to pay . 
  anyone arguing against it ... 
  i do n't want anything to do with them . 
   most of europe still thinks the roi is in the uk and you got that from an obviously silly map of stereotypes ? 
  how little you must think of us . 
  well , do you think the traitors should have been left to continue their merry life after taking part in war crimes against their own people ? 
  of course , the witch hunt was n't pretty and led to innocents being accused , but the opposite option of doing nothing is n't any good . 
  you youngsters do n't know what good music is anymore . 
  only -1400 's kids will get this . 
  and turns it into a `` fuck you germany '' joke . 
  is n't it wonderful ? 
   being pushed aside by someone trying to get on the metro that 's not asshole behaviour , that 's a public transport etiquette lesson . 
  * do n't block the goddamn metro door or you 're gon ' get the elbow . 
  the truth must prevail, 
  oh yeah [ zurek ] ( http://www.splendidtable.org/sites/default/files/styles/lede_image/public/zurekistockphoto.jpg?itok=o1n78aqd ) . 
  best thing i ate in poland . 
  it deserves more popularity !, 
  it 's the marini\u00e8re sauce full of cream . 
  the fries do n't help the calorie count either . 
  so you mean they almost never eat roast beef , and many of them think it 's weird ? 
  surprising . 
  you discovered how to grow wifi hotspots from dirt and have n't shared it with the world ? 
  wtf eesti , i thought we were tight !, 
  yeah , my commute is probably around 10h per week , living in a parisian suburb and working in and around paris . 
  all public transport . 
  like , 5 moneys ? 
  first it 's important to understand that many people voted * against * sarkozy and not * for * hollande in 2012 , so he started his term with a part of his electorate already unconvinced . 
  he failed to keep the others convinced by being kind of mediocre and uninspiring overall , despite a few good points ( like legalising gay marriage ) . 
  his administration passed some quite controversial bills , such as surveillance and especially the new labor code . 
  he has been called `` not socialist enough '' despite being from that party . 
  the wave of terrorism has n't helped , even though it 's not his fault . 
  he probably suffered the consequences for some of sarkozy 's bullshit too . 
  to right wingers , he 's anything from an incompetent pussy to the antichrist and root of all evil . 
  as shown [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqbhxeoru0 ), 
  senpai has noticed us \u00b0 o \u00b0, 
   if my theory of relativity is proven successful ... france will declare me a citizen of the world . 
  should my theory prove untrue , france will say that i am a german what does that mean ? 
  why does he bring up france of all countries ? 
  it does n't matter which country makes what official , nobody cares which word their government tells them to use . 
  the fact is neither the brits nor us are going to use `` czechia/tch \u00e9quie '' more , regardless of what is official in our respective countries . 
  when it comes to language , no amount of official rulings beats popular use . 
  french allows both , but i 've never heard or read tch\u00e9quie anywhere . 
  personally i do n't like how it sounds and will probably keep saying `` r\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que '' . 
   why do english speakers keep finding in slavic words vowels which do not exist there happens to anyone who reads a long word , in a foreign language , with unusual associations of letters ( like dn or vsk for most non-slavs ) . 
  add to that ignorance of the pronounciation rules which may or may not apply , and it takes no more for the brain to activate the `` big scary foreign word '' alert and hinder the ability to use intuition and decompose the word into manageable pieces . 
  honestly , you ca n't fault the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois for not being very keen on the british crown . 
  it must suck being a republican trapped under monarchy in your own country , and a foreign monarchy at that . 
  keep it up , proud of you !, 
  michel barnier is now saying he never commented on language : https://twitter.com/michelbarnier/status/789459759615410180 of course that would n't allow you to express your francophobia so ... better stick with the rumors i guess . 
  did you see that as an attempt to establish dominance or some shit ? 
  i did n't care much for them , but sometimes i found it interesting to see how other languages worked next to english . 
  upvote for an original joke . 
  but also fuck off mate . 
  oh yes , qu\u00e9bec is assuredly the most royalist , british-loving part of canada . 
  liz would feel right at home !, 
   attack , vandalize or loot random innocent people who 's only crime is that they 're just passing by . 
  because that does n't happen in detroit ? 
  again , what do you make of gun and drug violence ? 
  calais citizens do n't have to fear being shot by anyone . 
  and will you adress my claim that for most of them it 's counterproductive to draw the attention of police for reasons other than trying to get smuggled ? 
  you picked one of the most notoriously unsafe cities of the us , it 's hard to believe you . 
  everything that 's said about detroit ( particularly by americans themselves ) is quite a lot for one person to dismiss like it 's nothing . 
  it 's similar , but our ghettos are probably worse and more dangerous for them . 
  overall cops are n't seen very positively by the general population who tends to think of them more as enforcers/punishers than protectors . 
  however , they have the public on their side when they are stretched too thin , not supported enough by the government , or when they are attacked by thugs like in the recent molotov cocktail incident . 
   even detroit is a 5 star spa resort compared to that this is where you cross the `` major bullshit '' line . 
  detroit has a high crime rate , actual ghettos within the city , urban decay . 
  calais has none of that . 
  migrants definitely cause troubles and crime , but it 's ridiculous to compare it to detroit where there are guns , murders , muggings and drug trade . 
  they 're trying to get into the uk , it 's generally not in their interest to draw the attention of the police more than necessary . 
  easy there . 
  you may have good reasons to dislike the lifestyle in paris but it 's not a shithole or a dump . 
  jesus christ ... not the fork [ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/southpark/images/f/f9/mr_slave_cutout.png/revision/latest?cb=20091116222502 ), 
  well look at this guy 's frame , he does n't present the best image for his religion . 
  gluttony and sloth ( possibly greed too ) together :d, 
  that 's a well fed bishop . 
  all that tithing money must have bought a good amount of pierogi . 
  ^ ^ ^ soon ... 
  hopefully not if you 're parked in a row . 
  that would be silly . 
  this is a real article . 
  on the real wikipedia , not a parody version . 
  it 's got pictures , graphs , studies and everything . 
  on fucking tp orientation ??
