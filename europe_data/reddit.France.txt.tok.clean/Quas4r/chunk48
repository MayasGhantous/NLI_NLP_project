  at this point i 'm not sure if you really think the other guy is serious , or if you 're playing a trick of your own . 
  the turks have stopped wishing to join a long time ago . 
  it 's the typical turk retort , i see it whenever i read the comments on news articles about the aftermath of the coup . 
  dozens of ( presumably ) franco-turks who go '' it 's not your business , you just want to spread hate of turkey , why do n't you worry about [ something that 's wrong in france ] '' . 
  like , we 're not even allowed to talk about turkey , that 's already too much for them . 
  i have never seen such mindless and vehement nationalism . 
  they were born and raised here , but the minute we so much as mention turkey , it 's like they all become erdogan 's personal lawyers . 
  how have i never heard of this before ? 
  this is top banter fuel !, 
  i find that very powerful . 
  haha , i have a [ treat ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/18/pizza-vegetable-congress-says-so ) for you . 
  i did n't have to make anything up !, 
  no , america , pizza is not a vegetable . 
  france not even ranked ? 
  i do n't think it 's so bad here . 
  not an honest comparison . 
  on the one hand there are expats , on the other hand there are eu-born and raised people who go full retard with turkish nationalism even though it 's * not * their homeland . 
  the honor is safe . 
  that 's a ridiculous opinion . 
  i 'm sure many of them honestly believe they had to vote leave because they felt it was the best choice to preserve the young generation 's future , regardless of whether it is right or not . 
  and i say that despite all my disdain for the leave side . 
  `` god wills it '' . 
  it has a nice ring to it , too bad i 'm not a christian fanatic . 
  sure . 
  but you seem to imply this means she was n't french but just polish , when in reality she was both . 
  also true , but not the only truth . 
  naturalisation counts . 
  otherwise why would this process exist at all ? 
  they go to guyana for jungle training , but besides that they also fight against illegal gold diggers and provide security for the european space center in kourou . 
  his father left italy when the republic was proclaimed in 1946 , and never set foot there again until his death 37 years later because the constitution barred ( until 2002 ) all male heirs from ever returning to italian soil ; that 's harsh . 
  i do n't know what kind of guy he was , but i feel sad that he never got to see italy again . 
  i looked them up . 
  the `` legitimist '' guy , louis alphonse , apparently spoke in opposition of gay marriage and said a few months ago ( in my city even ) that laicism `` pushes back the unity that faith represents '' ; a royal cunt indeed . 
  he 's pretty handsome though , out of the 4 pretenders his head would look the best on the guillotine . 
  france has n't been fighting al qaeda much lately , they have all but dropped from most people 's radar . 
  almost all of their guys around the world who are or could be fighting france have declared for isis now . 
  that 's not what you said at all , you said the opposite . 
  you basically implied the services are incompetent and that if they were doing their job better it would n't happen . 
  apparently you do n't understand that france is a bigger target as this moment , or that lone wolf attacks ** can not ** be prevented . 
  whoever he was , this criminal did n't need to speak to any isis leader , or learn how to make a bomb , he did n't need to go to syria or visit extremist websites ... pretty much all he needed was having access to a truck . 
  who else has a reason to do something like this . 
   i wonder what french intelligence services are doing all day you just say that , as if you were some sort of expert with information from the inside . 
  you only hear about the attacks that do happen , many others are prevented and never heard of . 
  lone wolf attacks are impossible to prevent , no matter how good the intel services are . 
  please stop running your mouth about things you could n't possibly know about . 
  uk social experiment [ gone wrong ] [ brexit confirmed ] ( in the eu ), 
  he 's not an idiot , but he has a terrible rep with the foreign governments he 's supposed to deal with . 
  we 'll see what he makes of that . 
  the `` brexit minister '' is pretty respected , no ? 
  ayrault called him a liar , not an idiot . 
  being smart is a great asset for a liar . 
   the last thing you want is go to the fireworks , where you 'd get stamped on , overcrowded and wo n't see a thing anyway you 're talking about the champ de mars , where the view is [ great ] ( http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/sites/default/files/styles/live_full/public/assets/images/2014/06/feu_dartifice_c_henri_garat.jpg?itok=4iczr_zk ) . 
  all it takes is patience to get in and out of the area . 
  it is . 
  14th july is what we call it , not bastille day, 
  honestly , you really think there can be another war in the balkans ? 
  i think everyone is past that , despite all the tensions it will never be as bad as it used to . 
  you can stop worrying for croatia which is already `` safe '' in the eu . 
  fireworks happen in the sky , you know . 
  you do n't get it bro . 
  let [ cristiano ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zawyhcakcbm/ufjfbeqal_i/aaaaaaaadd4/vv4qaeyk0h8/w1200-h630-p-nu/cristiano-ronaldo-jews.gif ) explain . 
  yeah , i have no doubt they can [ ~ ~ knock off ~ ~ ] ( http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/funny-name-brand-imitation-3__605.jpg ) produce anything the good people of britain desire . 
   that 's america for you . 
  we just do it . 
  if you do it only because `` it 's the way we 've always done '' , you 're an idiot . 
   uncircumcised is nasty , and you guys get that funky dick cheese uncircumcised is * normality * , you 're the odd one out . 
  `` funky dick cheese '' , as you say , is easily avoided by this one weird trick called washing . 
  it seems some americans have n't figured out the advanced technique of pulling your foreskin back and applying water when you take a shower . 
  all these proclaimed `` sanitary benefits '' are laughable . 
  are you really so pretentious to think america has found some advantages to circumcision that the rest of the world has not ? 
  has it occurred to you that if every other country with advanced medicine does n't do it , you might be wrong ? 
   so you 're fine with jews doing what they want in israel but not in your country ? 
  sounds a bit weird to me . 
  why is that weird ? 
  when in rome , you do as the romans do . 
  if some saudi guy comes to the usa and tries to legally marry 10 women he will be told to fuck off . 
  however he can do so in saudi arabia . 
   sorry did n't realize it bothered you so much since they 're not your kids , and it 's not your penis . 
  it 's kind of like , what they do in the privacy of their own community / home should n't be of concern to you . 
  the kids are theirs , but they are also citizens of their country . 
  if a country , by law of the majority , rules that you can not cut your kid 's dick without a medical reason , you 're shit out of luck . 
  if you 're going to be a citizen of that country , you leave your kid 's dick alone . 
  if you really want to have the procedure done , you can fuck off to someplace that allows it and bring your backward-ass ideas with you . 
   assimilation into reddit hive-mind complete . 
  crush all cultures for human rights !, 
  sure , now the strawmen . 
  i have some real arguments i would like to discuss which you can read below if you like , or not . 
   myself and most americans were circumcised without our consent for no reason at all and we suffered no ill consequences you even say it was done to you for no reason . 
  then why have it done at all if your religion does n't require it ? 
  this is fucking stupid . 
   i 'm saying for the sake of world culture and jewish identity some concessions need to be made . 
  why is it us that should make the concessions ? 
  secular countries do not recognise religion , but they allow it to be practiced under certain terms . 
  this is our concession . 
  jewish identity can be fully expressed in israel , but other countries have no reason to permit it . 
   it 's wrong to force jews who 've been doing something for millennium to change their culture based on what others think is right . 
  but it is right to force secular countries to allow a practice they disapprove of ? 
  why should jews get to impose what they think is right , in lands that are not * just * theirs but shared with others . 
  you were n't lying . 
  here is a good one :  the uk had a referendum based on migration/immigration with the absolute idea that both will stop and we will be in control of our borders and i am pretty damn sure that this silly woman is totally aware of that .
