   `` jersey is n't that like france ''  no , no it is n't * grumblegrumble *, 
  i disagree . 
  firstly , the spelling differences are n't big enough to matter . 
  center or centre ... either you understand both or none . 
  secondly , the british spelling in these examples is in opposition with the pronounciation . 
  i ca n't see how a word that does n't sound how it 's written is better than one that does . 
  it 's not intuitive to write `` centre '' in english . 
  i 'm sorry to tell you this , but customs , mentalities and the world in general have been changing continuously since the beginning of humanity ... if it had n't been so , we 'd still be living in caves , naked and eating rotten animal carcass . 
  i do n't think we are as obsessed as you are to be above the other . 
  what contest is there even in being mentioned more on wikipedia ? 
  it 's not a value judgement . 
  you 're getting outraged for nothing . 
  nobody defends her , everyone laughs at her for getting caught red handed . 
  it 's fashionable to hate us , all the cool kids are doing it . 
  to look at the bright side i try to think of it as some kind of public service , if it was n't us it would be someone else . 
  we 're the punching bag the world deserves , but not the one it needs right now . 
  is that so ? 
  i remember reading about a study that proved it was n't true , unfortunately i do n't have it on hand . 
  anyway , if that 's true i do n't understand this line of reasoning at all . 
  i have songs in german or korean in my playlist that i do n't understand , and i like them because they sound good regardless . 
  hell , most of my playlist is in english and i ca n't say i understand every song fully . 
  maybe the people who want to preserve cultures and the people who demand english everywhere are not the same . 
  the artists themselves are subjected to a lot of pressure , consciously or not , to sing in english . 
  it 's like a generalised lobbying led by nobody in particular but with very real consequences . 
  i find it sad , all the contestants should show pride in their own language . 
  when our entry was in french we would get shit by people who saw this as being pretentious , `` too good for english '' or some other idiocy . 
  now we 're back into the fold , yay monoculture . 
  i 'm having troubles determining if i 'm not seeing your sarcasm or if you 're serious and got unironically upvoted ... 
  also , what is the random jesus flag about ? 
  i quite enjoy seing russian nationalists getting flipped off , but i do n't like when children are made to parrot political opinions . 
  why does everyone feel the need to remind us that all the time like we 're going to be super offended ? 
  not true, 
  do n't you hate it when you come across a member of the nobility and they run away before you can arm your guillotine ? 
  always be prepared . 
  regardless of the century , you ca n't go wrong with the * guillotine * ^ ^ tm , the vintage yet efficient execution method that never goes out of style !, 
  call today to get your * guillotine * ^ ^ tm and receive a free sharpening set !, 
  ^ ^ ^ aristocrats ^ ^ ^ sold ^ ^ ^ separately . 
  ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ leave ^ ^ ^ unattended ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ presence ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ children ^ ^ ^ under ^ ^ ^ 10 . 
  shhh is ok, 
  off with your head too !, 
  i like to play a little game when that happens . 
  even if they 're already leaning on the bar , i squeeze my hand in and stick my knuckles out as much as possible , then we see who caves first . 
  nothing like a good passive aggressive duel to help me get motivated on the way to work !, 
  i keep waiting for the moment one of them will say `` haha it was just a prank bro , you got trolled hard ! '', 
  and then all of them break out in a bhangra dance with 50 backup dancers . 
  this is not much of a frequent behaviour , really . 
  the worst offenders in the paris m\u00e9tro are those who take one step into the wagon and just stop , blocking the way for the people behind . 
  they do n't even deserve a quick death by guillotine , i say they should be hanged , drawn and quartered . 
  down with this sort of referendum !, 
  our anthem is more about defense than conquest , but it can sure make you thirsty for impure blood . 
   sacrifice children what ? 
  the line with children is about enemies coming to kill our children , not us sacrificing them ... 
   perhaps i am biased but asterix and the brits must rank as one of the all time best pieces of european literature i say , quite . 
   frankfurt seems to have a bigger reach i do n't think so , it 's the more central position that makes it look bigger . 
  i like trains . 
  awww . . turkey even has a cute little derpy star !, 
  i would n't make it beyond the first street . 
   a chicken can fight even if you cut it 's head off just a flesh wound !, 
  come on you pansy !, 
  it does n't . 
  i do n't know why people keep repeating `` good luck getting into eu now '' whenever turkey goes full retard , that ship has sailed long ago . 
  this is why i always read the comments first , there 's usually someone warning us about clickbait shit . 
  i thank these people for taking one for the team . 
  sure mate , he only died 2 years before the uk even joined , but he had indeed such a presence that i can see how he somehow kept affecting your behaviour while being dead for 40 more years ... 
  seriously , now is probably a good time to take responsibility for british euroscepticism that has been kept alive by nobody but yourselves as a people . 
  you ca n't blame everything on the french . 
   i 'm still of the opinion that brexit might be short term pain , for long term gain . 
  no one is able to tell yet , so let 's all calm down you 're completely missing the point . 
  this post is n't about the potential success or failure of brexit , it 's about farage 's comment . 
  he plans to bail if his country goes to shit because of what he started , i think we can agree that it 's a douchebag move regardless of how brexit goes . 
  this is an exceptionnally despicable comment even for him . 
  shaking up the status quo , while planning to run away if it does n't work out ? 
  that 's an interesting take on patriotism nige !, 
  top kek, 
  what do you mean `` odds of russian interference '' ? 
  they 're not even hiding . 
  it 's out in the open since our far-right loves russia , unlike the american far-right . 
  fn went to russia for funding , and mlp is currently waltzing into moscow to get a big hug from her sugar daddy vladimir . 
  i have a weird feeling in my pants ... and the urge to be held by strong manly arms ... 
  franglish is one of our top cultural exports !, 
  many * bad hombres * in brussels , let me tell you !, 
  that 's about it for me too , and i ca n't even say it since the pronunciation is too hard to make a good guess . 
  i looked up `` taoiseach '' since i saw it all the time in the news , surprisingly it sounds more like * tee-shay * than the * tawa-seetch * horror that my brain automatically reads ... 
  thank god i never had to say it out loud . 
  joking aside , there is increasing overlap between their electorates . 
  fn polishes its image to appear less crazy and poach lr voters , while lr becomes crazier in response to keep their voters from leaving further right . 
  following news outlets on facebook , i 've seen countless comments along the lines of `` if the scheming communist judges on hollande 's payroll steal fillon 's rightful victory , i 'll vote fn '' . 
  facebook comments are cancer but i ca n't help myself , i keep reading everytime ... 
   french people could perhaps do a better job . 
  not now , iz caf\u00e9 break . 
  zen iz time for going to ze demonstration against work . 
  and we have n't discussed my raise yet . 
  he has the best suits . 
  look at mr moneybags here , flaunting his riches . 
  on the contrary , please do show off more . 
  i 'm starting to feel embarassed that it 's mostly pictures of france spamming / r/europe right now . 
  is there a subtitled version ? 
  my highschool german can only take me so far and i really want to know what they 're saying . 
  big if true !, 
  damn .
