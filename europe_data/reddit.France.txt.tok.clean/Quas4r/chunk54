  now he can add `` i 'm not fillon '' to the list of his arguments , no actual policy needed !, 
  of course it would change if it appeared he was dirty too , then all bets would be off . 
   what fillon did might actually not be illegal more and more [ evidence ] ( http://www.ouest-france.fr/politique/francois-fillon/affaire-fillon-une-interview-et-un-contrat-de-travail-genants-4773884 ) is piling up against him . 
  for those who ca n't read french : in a 2007 interview given to the sunday telegraph , penelope fillon declared she had never worked as an aide for her husband , or dealt with communication . 
  however , we have paperwork ( her employment contract ) that proves she was paid as such from 1998 to 2002 . 
  her contract also bears 2 contradictory work adresses : one in the sarthe d\u00e9partement , another at an lr field office in paris . 
  before the lr primary election it was jupp\u00e9 who was strongly expected to be the nominee . 
  fillon 's large win was a surprise and started a momentum towards the presidency . 
  without all the recent shit that came out , he would have been almost assured to be president in a few months since it 's always a mainstream-left or mainstream-right ( lr ) candidate that wins , and people are currently unhappy with the left because of hollande 's term . 
   i 've been thinking that fillon was the way that le pen could win in the second round sarkozy would have been that guy , our clinton equivalent . 
  fortunately , he is so hated that he did n't even make it to the second round of his own party 's primary . 
  anyone but him is almost assured to beat le pen in a duel . 
  fillon less so now , but still . 
  haha !, 
  no one cares . 
  this is why you 're not supposed to take stereotypes literally . 
  i hope you do n't also believe we all live in m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois and wear berets every day . 
  only assuming here , but i would say this case hurts mlp among the undecided . 
  such cases of embezzlement are par for the course in french politics , so for a true neutral person it would probably not be surprising that the charges are legit and that fn is in deep , just like the others . 
  her base does n't think the charges against her are justified , fn cries persecution/slander whenever the media criticise them . 
  it 's true that sometimes they are reported on unfairly , but it does n't seem to be the case here . 
  of course , admitting to it and returning the money would be bad form ( surrendering to the communist multikulti brussels dictatorship ) , not to mention a rookie mistake in french politics !, 
  false equivalence . 
  thinking there are too many immigrants and overestimating the proportion of muslims in the population is not the same thing . 
  that 's one example . 
  i remember their rusty aircraft carrier painstakingly making its way around europe , experiencing fueling issues and losing parts all the way to syria . 
   russian technology is superior to that of the us and nato most wtf thing i 've read in this thread . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  no way russia is at the same level as usa and china , or a superpower . 
   germany needs to step down as a leading eu figure and let france and other countries do the leading ha , as if europeans liked us any better . 
  they probably think we 're less efficient on top of that . 
  in a distant future , eu , nato and un have failed and eurovision is the most powerful supranational organisation ... 
  i 'd watch that movie . 
  one great thing the eu does is drag the average up in places who are falling behind . 
  i 'm all for it , even it costs me since i live in a net contributor country . 
   that would mean there is a method to disable the nuclear arsenal yeah that 's the point of backdoors . 
  being able to disable technology that you developed when it is used by someone else . 
   once a nuke is launched there 's no going back . 
  how would you know ? 
   there 's literally zero logic in the article about why brexit , specifically , would be an obstacle for franco-british military funding it 's in the last lines : `` it is time for europe to defend itself -- and it would be good if we could unify and cooperate to build that defence '' . 
  if we want to achieve results with the project of eu army that 's been going around lately , brexit is surely going to be an issue . 
  eu army implies members only , nevermind the importance of the uk in european defence . 
   i do n't see any reason why either uk or france would want to end military ties . 
  this post is about brexit being an obstacle to closer cooperation , not ending current ties . 
   it might very well be that the us has a kill switch somewhere . 
  honestly the real surprise would be that they do n't , and not just because it 's the us . 
  what country * would n't * place backdoors in its licensed/leased technology ? 
  nobody is that nice , or naive . 
  nice try , northern ireland . 
   ca n't find any relevant nationalist movement in my homeland portugal does n't have a lot of international visibility . 
  no migrants or terrorists = not much for nationalists to grow on . 
  when you 're feeling disappointed about your country , remember that the us elected donald trump as their president . 
  i do n't see the difference, 
  depends on one 's definition of major . 
  above 9000 dead overall since the crisis began . 
  of course it 's hard to say which proportion can be directly pinned on russia , the rebels or ukraine respectively . 
  right , i forgot . 
  going full putin is definitely not the way to convince the undecided . 
   i also think that ukraine 's claim on crimea is just as weak if not weaker i disagree . 
  crimea was part of the soviet republic of ukraine from 1954 to 91 , then briefly became independant before accepting to join ukraine in 1992 in return for great autonomy as a ukrainian region . 
  the ukrainian claim is clearly stronger , crimeans accepted the tradeoff for more than 20 years . 
  i do n't disagree that the peninsula has been in majority ethnically russian for a long time . 
  in hindsight it should have joined russia instead , which would have avoided many deaths today and big headaches for the rest of us . 
  i also do n't disagree with a people changing their mind about allegiance . 
  however i disagree with the means . 
  if crimeans wanted to join russia they should have lobbied for it , ask official russian support , create unionist parties , and overall make it too much of a pain in the ass for ukraine to keep them ** but ** without working covertly or shedding blood . 
  as for russia , they should never have sent troops ( `` secretly '' first then overtly ) with the intention to annex part of a sovereign country . 
  i guess when i said you have crazy politics it also meant that they 're more unpredictable than ours . 
  going from obama to trump is a greater shift than hollande to le pen would be . 
  your electoral system is also structured in a way that made it possible for trump to win , i also had that in mind when i wrote shifts in society . 
  if you used a simple majority system like us , it would have been clinton . 
  but also the number of contestants involved : in your election only 2 parties make the top scores . 
  in ours it 's 3 , and even if le pen makes it to the 2nd round ( likely but not assured ) there is a high chance that the supporters of the major party that did n't advance will go to her opponent by default . 
  we also have `` small '' candidates that have a real presence . 
  last election , 2 of them got 10 % of the vote in the first round , which is a lot . 
  this year we also have a couple of potential `` king makers '' who do n't belong to the 3 biggest parties ( ps , lr , fn ) . 
  so i would say the craziest part about your election was trump winning the republican nomination . 
  once he was lined up as one of the only two pretenders , all bets were off . 
  as i 've said , our political scene is much more fragmented and likely to unite against le pen if she advances to the 2nd round . 
  edit : i would also add that your election had a unique situation in the fact that you had a duel between two extra hated and controversial candidates . 
  that is also not going to be the case for us . 
  well yes , because they matter . 
  to be more nuanced in my opinion that it ca n't happen , let me quote a great modern thinker known to frequent reddit : it ca n't happen * now * . 
  massive shifts in french society would be required for someone similar to trump to make it here . 
  and i mean actually similar , not just `` whoever is most closely relatable to him '' . 
   you had hitler and the holocaust well who is `` you '' ? 
  hitler was n't a ~ ~ european leader ~ ~ leader of europeans . 
  and even then , my reasoning would be that we have had cooperation and proximity like never before ( greatly thanks to the eu ) . 
  i honestly think we are too far gone in the direction of peace to ever go to war between europeans again . 
   i 'm pretty confident that `` it can never happen here '' generates unwarranted confidence in people around the world . 
  people do n't differ that much . 
  ok , i was wrong to say never because we ca n't know for sure and only siths deal in absolutes . 
  my more nuanced view would be that it ca n't happen * now * . 
  massive shifts in french society would be required for someone similar to trump to make it here . 
  and i mean actually similar , not just `` whoever is most closely relatable to him '' . 
  it 's a bit early to say , but i do n't think it can earn her or lose her enough support to be significant . 
  most people against her are now even more against her , and those who support her probably do n't think this one issue is worth reconsidering their choice , ** if ** they even disagree . 
  one comment on the situation of another country ( and distant too ) is not much compared to everything else she said , and that they agree with . 
   before that he was real friendly with petain and the nazis you ca n't say that , he was only 11 in 1939 and he even tried to join the french liberation army in 1944 . 
  it would be more accurate to say that some of the ideas he later adopted could be assimilated to petainism and negationism .
