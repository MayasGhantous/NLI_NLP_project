   yeah , because that will be totally cool with all of their relatives , friends and sympathizers . 
  murderers and rapists have relatives and friends too . 
  they do n't go killing people or raping people in retaliation when murderers and rapists get convicted . 
  islamic radicalism is a theological issue , not a knee-jerk reaction . 
   congratulations , you just multiplied the problem . 
  is there another island to put the next bunch ? 
  yes , actually . 
  literally thousands of them . 
  here are the big ones : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_\u00eeles_de_france, 
  they can call it whatever they want . 
  concentration camp , shariah island , whatever , let 's not get stuck on labels . 
  we can build a nice little town for them there , with clean water , heat , electricity , amusement , and wonderful weather . 
  they will be able to build 500 meter tall minarets and have 10,000 loudspeakers announcing prayer time five times a day every day . 
  sounds like a mutually beneficial solution . 
  it 's either that or i ) we can try to learn to dodge bullets and survive explosions when they attack our cities again or ii ) start going door-to-door to shoot them all . 
  not people . 
  islamists . 
  not people . 
  islamists . 
   how many of these ` potential suspects ' do you think there are in a country ? 
  could be as many as 5-10 ,000 . 
   intelligence services do not have the means to keep an eye on them 24/7 . 
  first , it 's physically impossible . 
  gather all the islamists , deport them to an uninhabited island in french polynesia or new caledonia . 
  problem solved . 
  not hard to keep tabs on them if you herd them up all up on an island . 
  the cover basically says `` it does n't matter that the jihadis are slaughtering us in our own cities because of the failure of multiculturalism in europe and the terror-supporting policies of our government in the middle east if we can drink our sorrows away '' . 
  it 's not a matter of want it 's a matter of not being able to afford having them . 
  ukrainian activists ( from kiev i believe ) set up a site for open source investigation where a list was compiled of 406 main battle tanks and other armored vehicles that the separatists captured from the ukrainian military , including 60 t-64bvs , 155 bmps , and 74 btrs . 
  in half of the cases they were even able to figure out which ukranian brigades these vehicles belonged to ( which was difficult because small elements of half a dozen different brigades would very often take part in the same battle ) : http://lostarmour.info/spoils/ meanwhile the ukrainians captured 32 armored vehicles from the separatists , including 5 t-64bvs and 2 t-72b1s . 
  the site also documents captured artillery and so on . 
  does n't seem like russia provided many vehicles , their main contribution was munitions ( they did n't even provide most separatists units with adequate small arms ) and training . 
  no , you 're wrong , the vast majority of mujahideen atgms in syria are american tows . 
  people are keeping accurate records of this . 
  in the last 5 months 368 atgms were fired by the mujahideen on camera ( which means that 368 were fired in total , every single atgm team in the mujahideen ranks has a dedicated camera man for propaganda purposes ) . 
  257 were tows . 
  https://pbs.twi mg.com/media/csrkx7gweaakh3o.png in october , 136 identified atgms were fired . 
  here 's a list : http://justpaste.it/octoberatgm 115 were tows . 
  a further 12 were fagots , these are also coming from america as the mujahideen have recently confessed , even the nightscopes are from uncle sam http://arabi21.com/story/869453/%d8%b5%d8%a7%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%ae-%d9%81%d8%a7%d8%ba%d9%88%d8%aa-%d8%a8%d9%85%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d8%b1%d9%87-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%84%d9%8a%d9%84%d9%8a-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%ad%d9%88%d8%b2%d8%a9-%d8%ab%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%b1-%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a7 most likely the us bought them from the bulgarians and romanians , which is where the us bought other soviet weapons for its proxy terrorist groups in syria earlier in the war . 
  iirc , bulgaria is also where that us contractor died a while ago while learning how to use soviet rpgs so he could then pass on the skills to `` fsa 30th division '' terrorists in jordan or turkey , because of a misfire . 
  are you illiterate ? 
  you are moving the goalposts , not me . 
  here is what i said :  i ) country a invites foreigners to settle in unsettled lands so they can be economically exploited  ii ) country a agrees to give foreigners land to settle in because the foreigners are mean barbarians which wo n't stop razing your cities and killing your soldiers until you pay them off with money or land or both i said foreigners . 
  bengalis/bangladeshis are not foreigners in india . 
  they are native to that country and constitute an integral part of it , half of the world 's bengalis live there , the other half live in bangladesh ( 125 million in india , 150 million in bangladesh ) . 
  the indians considered the hindu bengalis a part of the indian nation , not an external community . 
  that does n't really dispute anything i said , hindu bengalis fleeing from muslim bengal ( east bengal ) to hindu bengal ( west bengal ) is n't a mass migration of foreigners , nobody there considered them foreigners , they spoke the same language , had the same culture , and even followed the same religion as the place they fled to . 
  it 's more like ethnic germans fleeing from poland or czechoslovakia to germany after wwii . 
   statutory rape is not rape . 
  the rape part is right there in the name you know . 
   much of it will not as the money given directly to refugees will see much of it sent to family members back home and around the world no it wo n't be they barely receive enough money to feed themselves there . 
  the ones that send money back home are the ones with jobs . 
  then it becomes a lottery man , not asylum . 
  the basic human instinct here is to advance the interests of your community ( town/city/country ) at the expense of external communities , not to help members of external communities at the expense of your own community . 
  basic humanity ? 
  when in human history have humans ever allowed in massive amounts of migrants to enter their societies out of altruism ? 
  there are basically only 2 scenarios in which human societies have allowed massive migration , and it 's never altruism , the motivation has always been either profit or coercion . 
  i ) country a invites foreigners to settle in unsettled lands so they can be economically exploited ii ) country a agrees to give foreigners land to settle in because the foreigners are mean barbarians which wo n't stop razing your cities and killing your soldiers until you pay them off with money or land or both, 
  if that is what germany wanted then germany would just import young people from eastern and southern europe , who are more educated and more culturally compatible with germans instead of importing illiterate farmers from the third world mate . 
  germany could find tens of millions of qualified young people just dying to be imported by germany in eastern and southern europe . 
  the absolute monarchies that imprison women for being raped and publicly behead people for black magic ? 
  yeah i do n't think they 're much into the whole human rights thing . 
  lol if we went around refugee camps picking out people most in need we 'd be accepting like 10,000,000 immigrants a year, 
  was n't erdogan mayor of istanbul before pm ? 
  i mean with his whole `` the mosques are our baracks , the minarets are our bayonets , and the faithful are our soldiers '' speech , i wonder if istanbul has n't been dominated by akp types for longer than recent years . 
  or did he get elected by downplaying his islamist agenda ? 
  is n't istanbul mostly populated by immigrants from rural regions ? 
  i hear most of the city is nothing like the other western cities , it 's more like the southeast . 
   what i 'm wondering is if other nato members are obligated to defend another nato government that has an internal revolt . 
  not at all . 
  not that nato would defend the akp government even if they were obligated to do so . 
  a revolt in ankara/istanbul would be dominated by chp types and gulenists . 
  they 're more pro-american/pro-nato than the akp . 
  it 's not like there is a chance of a communist uprising that would align turkey with the soviet union if it succeeds . 
  i do n't understand the problem here , or how it can increase . 
  these are economic migrants , as a rule they keep their heads down and do n't cause any trouble unlike the untitled brats that receive asylum and leech off the state . 
  they provide cheap labor for german businesses which is a plus for germany and it 's a plus for them as well because even though they are undocumented migrants , their lives are still better off than back home . 
  win-win . 
  100s of people in a country of 80,000,000 ? 
  how many illegal immigrants are there in germany ? 
  more ? 
   was n't it medvedev who started a war with georgia ? 
  same hell , different devils . 
  saakashvili started the war , medvedev finished it . 
   norway is a social democracy , not a `` socialist democracy '' , and bernie sanders has nothing to do with any of the scandinavian countries policies his own claims aside . 
  social-democracy is a german contraction of `` socialist democracy '' , guy , karl marx 's disciples like liebknecht and bebel founded the party movement in the 19th century just before the german empire was born . 
  their marxist party , the sdap ( later sdp ) became the most organised and popular party in germany so other socialist parties began modeling themselves on it , including the russian marxists ( who called themselves social-democrats until 1917 when the social-democratic movement split on the question of the first world war lead to the revolutionary socialists breaking off from the reformist socialists and renaming themselves from socialists to communists ) . 
  social-democracy literally does mean socialist democracy . 
  well basically by the end of the 90s a mild housing shortage became felt and the government decided that instead of having the state fix it they 'll try the neoliberal route and get the markets to do their thing but it turned out that since sweden has a very strongly regulated housing market and rent setting , the markets did n't do anything since it was too expensive to build enough new affordable housing and there was little profit in it because they ca n't charge exorbitant prices , so only expensive housing for high-income people is built but that does n't solve the issue since low-income people in their 20s are the most hard-hit by the housing shortage . 
  so now sweden 's housing market is fucked because none of the rewards of a social-democratic housing policy combined with a neoliberal housing policy have been reaped , only the drawbacks of both . 
  swedes got fucked by both the state and the markets . 
  there is a ridiculously acute housing shortage in sweden in the big cities and university towns , to rent an apartment in g\u00f6teborg for example you might have to wait a couple of years . 
  they even speak a medieval dialect of mittelhochdeutsch . 
   and let 's stop with this layers , engineers and doctors mantra . 
  literacy level in syria is 80 % which mean that statistically speaking there is now 20-50k of illiterate refugees in europe . 
  no there are n't , only the educated middle class syrians are coming here because they are the only ones that can pay the thousands of euros to the smugglers . 
  and alongside france , the uk , croatia , bulgaria , etc. 
  that 's why all syrian refugees should go to these countries . 
  no , not really . 
  czechs and poles did the same thing in literally the same period ( mid to late 1940s ) when they expelled millions of germans from the sudetenland and western poland and gave everything czech and polish names .
