  if not , entirely against our will , the [ military ] forces will act and destroy you . 
  one must obey the state '' ( halli 1972 : 390-91 and 491 ) . 
   then why you told me that majority of kurds are supporting hdp and pkk ? 
  because the majority doesnt mean all of them . 
  majority means majority of the voters . 
  majority means more than 50 % . 
  you clearly lack some real knowledge man . 
  i honestly find it sad for you . 
  like i said , the voter population ca n't be generalized directly to the population . 
  1 ) not all kurds vote for hdp 2 ) there are a lot of kurds in rural areas who dont vote at all the lowest estimates for turkish kurds have been 15-19 million , and some go as high as 22 million . 
  there are more than 3 million kurds in istanbul alone , that 's only in 1 city . 
  first of all , it 's logically that not everyone can vote . 
  some are too old , some are too young , some just do n't vote . 
  and besides that , not all kurds vote for hdp . 
  this is a very ridiculous claim . 
  the number of kurds in turkey is not lower than 19 million . 
  in istanbul alone , there are around 2-3 million kurds . 
  why are they returning ? 
  so the only refugees who actually do work , return back ? 
  also how big is the kurdish community in sweden ? 
  the secular rebels dont dominate the place . 
  dont make up lies to feed your european dream . 
  half of kurdistan wasnt solely armenian and armenians werent the majority there . 
  northern mesopotamia/southeastern anatolia has a great history of being multicultural . 
  there have been many kurdish emirates there and northwestern iranics ( kurds are neo period iranics and parthians are middle period iranics ) have been dominating the region for thousands of years . 
  arsacid armenia was ruled by arsacids , also called parthians , one of the ancestors of kurds . 
  professor gernot windfuhr even studied kurdish languages and found direct derivatiom betweem the parthian and kurdish language , which both are northwestern iranics .

  while more common in kurdish-populated areas , it is also common in turkish-populated areas : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/was-ahmet-yildiz-the-victim-of-turkeys-first-gay-honour-killing-871822.html http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2010/04/16/un-bebe-de-2-jours-victime-d-un-crime-d-honneur-en-turquie_1335090_3214.html http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2009-05-21-voa39-68815262/363828.html, 
  it 's ` murica , not america !, 
  again , that 's not how democracy works . 
  you do n't count the people who have n't voted . 
  also , there is 0.0 suggesting that those people would all vote for secular parties ( hdp , chp ) if they voted , in fact there is more chance that they would vote for akp ( since akp has been the biggest party under turkish voters in almost every country ) . 
  so at best , only 53 % of the turks in germany voted for akp . 
  at worst , it is even higher ( like in other countries like nl where it is 60 % + ) . 
   to put in perspective , only 250.000 out of 1.4 million turks in germany voted for the akp . 
  no , that 's not how democracy works . 
  it 's not about those who didnt vote , but about those who voted . 
  53 % of the turks in germany voted for akp islamist party . 
  and to put things any more in perspective : a lot of people who dont vote , are usually the older people , who tend to be more conservative and tend to lean towards akp anyways . 
  is this your excuse ? 
  turks in the whole world , almost every country thus , have voted for akp . 
  newsflash for you : akp has been the ruling party of turkey for 12 years . 
  that 's how democracy works dude . 
   i think saying `` majority of turks are islamist '' gives off such a bad image though . 
  firstly that is an incorrect statement , majority of turks voted for opposition parties . 
  voter rate of turks in germany : ** turks in germany voted 53 percent in favor of the akp , ** while , mirroring the trend worldwide , second place went to the hdp with 17 percent . 
  the akp was especially strong in western european countries where there is a large turkish diaspora , coming first in germany , france , the netherlands , belgium , austria and norway . 
  at the same time , voters in most arab countries , particularly in north africa , also opted for the ruling party . 
  and this poll has taken the kurdish voters for hdp too , which means that if the kurdish voters were put away , the % of voters for akp was even higher . 
   but what are akp supporters ? 
  they are n't all super duper political islamists like what you think in your head . 
  they 're just turks voting for our equivelant of the republican party . 
  not saying it 's good , but if turkey were a christian country and akp had a christian agenda , then it would n't be as scary as when we say `` turks are islamist . '', 
  there are also crypto-secular people inside the saudi government , does that make the saudi government secular too ? 
  who says that ? 
  also majority of turks are islamist , they vote for islamist parties . 
  especially in europe the support for akp islamist party is relatively high . 
  yes . 
  islam teaches that , only the laws of allah ( swt ) are legit . 
  thats what i am saying . 
  to defeat pkk you have to resolve social issues , not fight the pkk militarily . 
  has military conflict solved the issue ? 
  30 years later the issue is still relevant . 
  its time to realize there needs to be another solution . 
  dividing turkey shouldnt be the answer but neither oppressing a group and even denying them a sense of honor does . 
  funniest thing in the article ( and all these `` anti pkk articles '' ) is that they wo n't show * why * the pkk was created in the first place . 
  turks use all their power to show that pkk is a terrorist organization yet how many of them acknowledge that pkk got its power because of the terrorist and racist activities the turkish state has been employing since its existence . 
  the pkk can be defeated so easily , just by including kurds into the turkish instutions . 
  but even today the racism and biased against minorities in turkey has not been decreasing ( after 100 years ) . 
  my hypothesis is that because turkey was largely kept out of ww2 , it did n't experience what nationalist racism can do and kept the ideology as the last country in the region where this ideology remained . 
  the biggest , greatest terrorist attacks in the last year have been turkish army killing kurdish people . 
  turkey for 2 years supported isis because they were killing kurds . 
  we know who are the real terrorists . 
  saying that ypg is a terrorist organization because they support ocalan is like saying chp is a terrorist organization because they support ataturk . 
  you can hate ocalan for what you want , but dont forget that he came up at a time when turkey said kurds dont exist . 
  rest in peace and stay safe , from france . 
  the ` nationalism is associated with secularism ' is also a negative aspect if you look at it from a historical perspective . 
  much of the kurds you see in this poll voted no because historically ** all ** secular governments in turkey have repressed kurds and many of them even said that kurds did n't exist as a people . 
  it has historically been the islamic oriented governments in turkey that have supported some type of kurdish rights , which has resulted in kurds disfavoring secular governments as they are heavily associted with racism and fascism in turkey . 
  that 's why 50 % of the kurds used to vote for akp , because they saw this islamic identity as finally binding turks and kurds whereas secular turkish governments imposed the turkish ethnicity on kurds . 
  chp has for the last years tried to repair kurdish-turkish relations on a progressive manner but many kurds still associate chp with its policies of decades ago when the party was responsible for forced assimilation and repression of kurds . 
  also , do n't forget that akp voters are not non-nationalist . 
  they are just a mix of nationalism and religious conservatism . 
  look at the protests in the netherlands and germany , those people were not flying islamic flags but turkish flags and chanted turkish nationalist songs . 
  it is very easy to say that . 
  if we put it in a historical perspective , every secular government in turkey has repressed kurds to such a point that they associate secular governments with racism and fascism . 
  to put it simply , it is not that kurds in turkey are against secularism but that all the secular governments of turkey have committed huge human rights abuses against kurds ( including rape , murder , destruction of villages and ban of kurdish language ) . 
  the fact that you spend more time defending turkey than condeming these racist attacks against kurds , proves the point of this article : collective racism and hatred against people . 
  i thought turks at reddit were liberal and secular , but then i went to the turkish subreddit and the comments there with full of people dehumanizing the student by labeling him a `` a listener to pkk music '' . 
  i was very disappointed to see that the liberal turks at that subreddit are as backwards as akp supporters regarding minority rights . 
  just see how many people downvote this topic . 
  they are trying to hide everything that is bad in turkey . 
  this kind of `` philosophical thought '' is regressive for human society ... and to think that he 's actually had education and has access to top researchers . 
  just imagine what the average guy from that country thinks . . 
   if it truly is islam , why have n't turks committed terror in germany yet even though 3 million of them live in germany since 70 's ? 
   who says they didnt commit terror ? 
  one of the biggest dutch jihadists in syria was ethnically turkish ( alongside other turks traveling to syria for jihad ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israfil_yilmaz most turks in europe also vote for erdogan . 
  not probably the '' enlighted '' person a secularist would vote for . 
  it gets even worse when we include turkey 's own population :  hundreds of mothers and fathers in turkey are speaking those very words .
