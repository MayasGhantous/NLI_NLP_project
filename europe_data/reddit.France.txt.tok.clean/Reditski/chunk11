  according to official figures , about ** 2,500 individuals have traveled from turkey to iraq and syria to join is ** . 
  about 800 even took their families with them . 
  according to security experts al-monitor spoke to in ankara , the reality on the ground is much more worrisome . 
  one source , who did not want to be identified , said 5,000 turks have crossed . 
  another source said , `` the real problem is not the ones who go to syria and iraq to fight , but those who are radicalized and stay here . 
  they [ number ] in the thousands . '' read more : http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/turkey-salafi-radicalization-on-the-rise.html#ixzz4ttkg6atn there is even a whole group in germany called * caliphate state * with many turkish members who want to make turkey a new caliphate :  differentiated from the concept of the hizb ut-tahrir , the caliphate state in germany aims to replace the secular regime in turkey with the caliphate system . 
  the goal is regional and has turkey as the target . 
  this also means that the caliphate state has no political targets in germany or in any other country . 
  the narrative of the caliphate state has no elaborated concept of the state and focuses on the writings and the discourse of the former leader and other members of the organisation , non - or anti-islamic politics and the non islamic way of life of the founder of the republic , mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk . 
  beyond this rhetoric , the theories that he was born as an illegal child ( veled-i zina ) play an important role .213 https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/doc_centre/terrorism/docs/ec_radicalisation_study_on_ideology_and_narrative_en.pdf, 
  i do n't dispute whether he is killed . 
  i dispute the motive . 
  due to turkey 's freedom of press we do n't know the motive . 
  nobody is allowed to ` reveal ' the truth anyways because if it could hurt erdogan then he would smash the newsreporter . 
  remember the incident of turkey 's opposition newspaper revealing that turkey supplied syrian '' moderate opposition '' with weapons ? 
  the journalist was persecuted . 
   this kid was just 15 . 
  3 years younger than me . 
  no offense but how do we know this is true ? 
  turkish media is considered the least trustable media in the world . 
  [ i remember this case of turkish media discussing whether aliens were turkish or not ] ( http://galeri2.uludagsozluk.com/206/ufolar-turk-mu_272552.jpg ) . 
  according to ngo 's , turkey regularly kills journalists that are reporting anything that could go against the government narrative . 
   journalists working in the country 's predominantly kurdish southeast faced serious obstacles to their reporting -- such as threats , physical violence , and criminal investigations -- in the context of a counterinsurgency campaign against kurdish separatist fighters . 
  at least one journalist was killed while working in the region , and residents experienced multiple episodes of interrupted internet service or social media access . 
   i do n't think you know what brigading means . 
  it does n't matter what i think . 
  the reddit admins definitely acknowledged the turkish brigading and warned the moderators of / r/turkey . 
  turkish downvote brigade is a real thing . 
  a month or 2 ago , they openly called for brigading this sub until the admins removed their topic at / r/turkey and warned their mods . 
   is not a good way of reasoning . 
  this news article may or may not be true . 
  all i can say is , sources have zero confirmation . 
  the news organisation has below zero credibility & accountability and a clear bias . 
  turkey does not allow free media , let alone free kurdish media . 
  so yes , these sources ** may ** be dubious , but there are no other sources due to turkish policy so these only sources are the only thing we can base our opinions on . 
  is n't it a little bit suspicious that turkey does not allow any media to go into kurdish areas ? 
   in towns across the region , trustees have changed the names of streets previously named for prominent kurdish figures , or removed statues of kurdish heroes . 
  more than a dozen lawmakers from the main pro-kurdish party have been arrested in recent months . 
  a kurdish artist was jailed for doing a painting of the ruins of nusaybin , one of several kurdish towns partly destroyed in 2015 during fighting between the turkish army and kurdish militants . 
  so who is going to ensure that these people get a fair trail ? 
  we know that turkish justice system is fully under the control of akp government . 
  according to human rights organizations :  the turkish government 's onslaught on kurdish towns and neighbourhoods , which includes round-the-clock curfews and cuts to services , is putting the lives of up to 200,000 people at risk and amounts to collective punishment , amnesty international said today . 
   ( istanbul ) -- the turkish government has jailed 13 members of the pro-kurdish democratic opposition in parliament on terrorism charges and taken direct control of 82 municipalities in the kurdish southeast region , suspending and incarcerating elected mayors , human rights watch said today . 
  the crackdown on democratically elected officials not only violates their rights to political association and participation , and freedom of expression , but also interferes with the rights of constituents who voted for them and whom they serve in office . 
  and do n't come telling me that kurdish people are only jailed for supporting pkk . 
  it 's way too easy to blame pkk for everything that turkey does do wrong against kurdish people . 
  that was pkk members being beheaded by turkishs soldiers . 
  here is the video of it . 
  i have worse photo 's than holding a gun yet that does n't automatically disqualify me from doing humanitarian work . 
  this women went to fight isis , the same organisation that caused the refugee crisis . 
  acting like they are the wrong side only to appease turks who are on a dictatorship is contray to our values . 
  this is n't so much influenced by erdogan as it is by turkish nationalism . 
  by definition , turkey and most turks are negative towards any form of kurdishness . 
  even iraqi kurdistan which many turks used as an ` example of relationship between non-pkk kurds and turkey ' , is a false example . 
  turkey used to threaten peshmerga ( iraqi kurdish fighting force ) with war back in the days . 
  here is an article of 2007 where turkey threatened to invade iraqi kurdistan '' under the pretext of iraqi kurdistan supports pkk '' https://www.rferl.org/a/1077605.html whenever a kurdish group comes up , no matter where , turks will claim that they support the pkk and somehow people will automatically find their casus belli legitimate . 
  we need to look deeper , and that is that turks feel threatened when kurds become self-concious . 
  ypg is a secular organization which found itself to defend syrian kurds . 
  it is nothing like the islamic factions that are also supported saudi/paki , who by definition have nothing in common with the west . 
  ypg follows a leftist western ideology and has incorporated many things which were suppressed in the middle east ( feminism for example ) . 
  turkey does n't like them because they have links to the pkk . 
  but then again where was turkey when the syrian rebels ( supported by turkey ) were attacking kurdish civilians and killed many of them ? 
  the pkk has helped the ypg . 
  what turkey simply demands is that ypg leaves its friends with the ` good cadeau ' of eventually not being accepted by turkey anyways . 
  what we know from the cases in france and the rest of europe is that turkey regularly uses civil servants such as teachers , professors and normal looking people to infiltrate and then execute kurdish political figures . 
  for example , in germany there are many cases now of turkey deploying spies to gain intelligence on kurdish civilians who , on their turn , hand it over to the turkish government . 
  [ * german prosecutors have filed espionage charges against a turkish national , identified as mehmet fatih sayan , for spying on kurdish expats at turkey 's request . 
  * ] ( https://stockholmcf.org/germany-man-who-spied-on-kurds-for-turkish-intelligence-received-30000-euros/ ) i do n't know the full case of mr. hamit yilmaz and i sympathize with his family . 
  however , we should realize that turkey triggers the pkk in doing this due to its deployment of very dirty tactics . 
  how can you try to use teachers , who suppose to teach kids and bring them up , as an intelligence tool for your political goals ? 
  that 's the most evil part . 
  this reminds me of what the turks did to the armenians . 
  they used the dashnak ( the armenian fighters against the ottomans ) excuse to target everybody non-muslim in that era . 
  [ here is an actual report from that data , which the turks claim is fake ] ( http://www.armenews.com/img/armenia_in_the_world_war_gibbons_1926.pdf ), 
  how many have they done for saudi arabia , your lovely state ? 
  yeah , an end of an era until germany actually spends something on their military . 
  people act like the us owns germany anything . 
  yall dont realize that if we push us away , they will just find a new friend in russia . 
  stop with the anti american racism and crap . 
  you hippy-loving , weed-smoking political `` strategists '' dont understand anything . 
  every post here in european subreddit is about trump . 
  yet none of them are about european support for saudi arabia , father of isis and turkey , the successor of a state which was closer to isis than to europe . 
  i said economic migrants, 
  there is a difference between important and '' important '' . 
  turkey is being used as a tool against russia , because russian fleet in black sea is relatively weak as long as a nato member blocks the straits . 
  however , that is just one issue . 
  an alliance shouldnt be one issue . 
  turkey is an enemy in many respects , think of its violations of greek airspace ; its support of islamist anti-west militants in syria and iraq ; its occupation of cyprus and its close relationship with russia . 
  china isnt doing this because they are so great . 
  they do this because their cities are literally death chambers with smog and some of their cities even are drowning . 
  in addition they have oversupply of energy . 
  turkey is not important , only to contain russia in the sea . 
  they are attacking all our allies in the middle east , from iraqi forces to syrian kurds to armenians . 
  with turkey as a friend , you dont need an enemy, 
  let 's be honest . 
  most of eu policy is done on a basis to atleast not hurt germany . 
  we need a more balanced eu before we consider those things . 
  for example with the refugee question , many east european states do not want economic migration from islamic countries nder the umbrella of refugee shelter . 
  what has happened ? 
  germany threatened them with economic ` sanctions ' .
