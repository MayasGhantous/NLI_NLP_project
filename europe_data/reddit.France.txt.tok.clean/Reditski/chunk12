  i love the eu and support eu , but i am not an europhile . 
  the eu is there to support the general cause of eu member states , not only germany 's . 
  how do you think that is going to rise ? 
  the islamic regimes dont allow normal education . 
  its either islamic education ( which often times means ban of science , like in erdogans turkey where evoluation theory is being disputed ) or no education at all . 
  french law and german-influenced eu policies regularly clash . 
  afghanistan is really one of the most failed state in the history of mankind , along unsuprisingly their neighbor pakistan . 
  almost everything you do there is a waste of resources . 
  on the other hand if the west pulls its troops and leaves afghanistan , not only will there be a super islamic terrorist state emering out of there , but it will also destabilize the whole south asia and western asia region . 
  the sunni islamist terrorists will try to destabilize both shiites in iran and hindus in india . 
  pakistan may either be the beneficiary ( as the main supporter of afghan islamist taliban ) or also be destabilized ( if isis or anti pakistan islamist militants take over ) . 
  it does need one , but not the one the eu top wants . 
  they want one where germany will influence and decide for the rest of europe . 
  this can not be done and is a violation of french law . 
  so what you are saying is : all the rape , torture and oppression of millions of kurds including children , was right because it is a state vs people . 
  the fact that you are talking about `` creating a kurdish identity '' just shows how instutionally racist turkey and most turks are . 
  no wonder that you support erdogan , you people all show your true colours . 
  first it was the armenians and now it is the kurds .

  a few days ago , greece threatened us with granting all the immigrants some type of eu travel papers . 
  most of these immigrants , are arab muslims . 
  now i am not trying to be racist , and i know that a lot of arabs are actually good persons , but i live in europe and i have seen how a lot of arab immigrants behave inside the eu . 
  - they do not care too much about adjusting to our culture ( they keep an islamic/arab culture rather than adjusting to an european ) , - their language barrier is big and most of the older people are never able to speak an european language fluently - and a lot of the times most immigrants are poor people who have n't got good decrees , so they 'll cost the eu a lot of money in terms of education and house-finding . 
  besides that , i find that every major european city with a lot of muslim arab immigrants , tends to pauperize ( although this is not due to arab people being there ) and tends to have an increase in ethnic tensions between native people and immigrants . 
  i find these developments very horrendous already , and greece wants us to be flown with another million immigrants as an extra ? 
  this will definetely lead to a very declined european union . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  how should we response to greece ? 
  ps : like i said , there are a lot of good arab people , but one should understand that i love my country too , so i only hope for the best and am somehow feared . 
  i initially loved the eu . 
  i thought it was a good step towards peace in europe . 
  but now , i am very very skeptical . 
  there are many flaws : - ** the cultural difference is big . 
  ** on one side you got countries where corruption is almost the norm ( bulgaria ) , while we also got countries that are overly pacifists and would n't mind if their countries would be taken by immigrants ( sweden ) . 
  - ** the language barriere is too big . 
  ** germany and france show no signs that they are willing to leave their own languages to install english as the norm language . 
  currently , there are hundreds of translators that have to do all the work . 
  this creates no unity whatsoever between the european people . 
  - ** economically it is a disaster for individual countries . 
  ** for example , countries like spain and greece need devaluation of their currencies to be able to compete internationally . 
  spain and greece need low currencies , so that more tourists will be attracted + their products will be more attractive to export . 
  right now , with the currency of the eu which is centralized , these countries are in a throttle hold . 
  - another thing that really bothered me is , we 're saying that we need to form 1 big market and stuff . 
  but then , germany introduced a toll system for non-german drivers who use german roads . 
  how is this even progressive for 1 big europe ? 
  you 're already discriminating non-germans on the road , is n't that paradoxic to the whole point of the eu ? 
  - ** military the european union means literally nothing ** . 
  there is n't even an european army , we 're relying on the nato . 
  one could say , the nato is enough . 
  but the nato is n't purely a european union army . 
  we still have to deal with other players so we can never decide what we do without the big influence of the usa . 
  i 'm not anti-eu like i said , but i am very skeptical . 
  there are people out there who oppose the european union , and there are people out there who support the european union . 
  regardless of your opinion on the eu , the eu is present and is not going away . 
  now that we all have accepted that we are part of the eu , i think that it is necessary for us all to work towards 1 standard european language . 
  and by this i do n't mean that we have to forget our mother languages ( french/german/spanish / italian/whatever ) , but that we should involve 1 language much more into the eu and the eu-states so that integration and cohesion gets intenser . 
  in my opinion , i think that english should be the standard language of the eu . 
  it is already the lingua franca of the world and english is quite easy to learn for europeans . 
  at the moment we got a complex problem of hundreds of translators that are needed because the european union members can not understand each other too well . 
  also , i do n't feel like that is should be normal to visit a european country and not be able to understand eachother . 
  if the eu vows to do more to install 1 standardized language , we can all benefit from it . 
  ** now , what is your thought on installing 1 standardized language for the eu ? 
  do you think the eu is doing enough regarding this subject ? 
  i would prefer to have a presidential system , because : - ** a presidential system is decisively ** : the government can do things much faster instead of relying on coalitions and making compromises which sometimes led to lax measures . 
  - ** a presidential system has a seperate legislative elections ** which makes it more representative cause the separate legislature has n't any obligation to constantly support the government like in a parliamentary system where the government has to rely on coalitions which often times support the government to keep the government standing . 
  what do you think ? 
  in comparison with the executive power ? 
  the eu was supposed to reflect a real democracy model with seperation of powers . 
  but the executive power is largely dominant in many aspects . 
  i want to know why . 
  can somebody explain it to me ? 
  [ removed ], 
  the refugee probleem has got a lot of us busy lately . 
  in my opinion , many concerns are illegitamite and dont outweigh the benefits refugees bring . 
  here is my take on why we europe should accept more refugees : 1 . 
  europe is a big continent , and the eu is big enough to host many more millions . 
  for example , india is a country with 1.2 billion people living in it , and it still manages to grow . 
  europe has a lot of ghost towns and non-dense places that can easily take a lot of refugees . 
  also , europe ( mainly western-eu ) has a big population ageing problem : more people are getting older , while indegenous europeans get way too less children . 
  the refugees can stabilize this problem because middle easterners 1 ) breed a lot of children and 2 ) [ many of the refugees are ** young ** men ] ( http://pamelageller.com/2015/09/refugees-in-europe-young-fit-and-overwhelmingly-male.html/ ) , meaning that they can reduce our ageing problem . 
  eu has a population of 500 million people , syria has one of 17 million and iraq around 33 million . 
  so even at worst , europe would be able to cope with the demographic challenges because the eu is way bigger than the main refugee countries . 
  we can literally take millions every year without altering the demographcis drastically . 
  humanitarian reasons . 
  we need to respect our declaration of human rights . 
  it 's the same rights that we have to apply for if europe ever gets into a war . 
  yes , not every refugee is democracy-orientated and respects women rights , but who cares ? 
  it 's their culture and it 's racist to judge people by their color or culture . 
  we should just accept them for who they are . 
  and if they try to impose their culture on us , we should open up for their cultural advocacies and start a debate . 
  but at all times , we should accept each other and what they think . 
  we should not force our believes on them . 
  europe is built on respect and empathy for others , so we should accept their culture no matter what . 
  economy . 
  eu is right now the largest economy in the world . 
  watch countries like india , with far less gdp but more people , and india 's economy is still growing . 
  one of economics principles is that more people can lead to more economic growth .
