  says the guy who justifies the killing of kurdish civilians because pkk killed turkish soldiers . 
  i dont have to read the rest of your racist comment . 
  someone who justifies throwing stones at buildings and even trying to take pride of it , is nothing more than a fascist . 
  people like you create the necissity of the pkk . 
  when kurdish civilians see that turkish fascists can throw stones at kurdish politicians without the police intervening , they are forced to look at the pkk . 
   i was one of them who throw stones to empty hdp buildings with turkish nationalists , did any1 injured expect police no ? 
  so you 're proud of attacking hdp buildings because there were no persons in it ? 
  so you 're promoting violence and racism and think this is okay ? 
  i have this printscreened , thanks for the information . 
  next time when turks deny that there were people who trew stones at hdp buildings i 'll show them your quote . 
  you 're a violent racist who attacks kurdish politicians and parties , a true turkish racist and you are the sole reason why the pkk resistance must protect kurdish civilians and politicians from turkish supremacy . 
  this is the most important part . 
  as long as they will never be kicked out , they will somehow have citizenship . 
   the clothes the guy wearing are pkk militant clothes . 
  no , idiot . 
  those are kurdish clothes . 
  kurdish people all around the world wear it . 
  those clothes have been existing prior to pkk 's existence . 
  like i said , you are an ignorant racist turk who think pkk = kurdish . 
  by this sentence you already proved your racism and ignorance on kurdish people and culture , i 'm not even going to read the rest of your bullshit . 
   he posted pkk sympathizing pictures after the son of someone in the neighbourhood was killed in daglica the day before by that very same pkk . 
  how do you think people would react to something like that ? 
  pkk symapthizing photos ? 
  he posted a foto with kurdish clothes saying '' it is a honor to wear these clothes '' , but i forgot that kurdish identity means being a pkk sympathizer according to nationalistic turkish fascism . 
   and unfortunately civilians will be hurt in urban warfare . 
  why do these pkk terrorists occupy and block these areas and by doing so put civilians in harms way ? 
  clearly they do n't care about the civilian populace . 
  unfortunately civilians will be hurt during urban warfare ? 
  turkish snipers willingly killed a 70 year old man , it was a murder and not a '' mistake '' . 
  turkey has been killing more than 100 000 kurds and has displaced more than 2 million , it clearly isnt about '' bad luck '' http://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/turkey0305/3.htm#_toc97005223, 
  most kurds are pkk . 
  anyone telling you the difference is lying . 
  you go amid and ask people if they love pkk . 
  they 'll show you the many kurdish civilians killed by turkish state and you 'll understand why they support pkk . 
   turkish peaceful protestors ? 
  turkish peaceful protests , ** yeah right ** . 
  oh so peaceful by attacking and destroying buildings of pro-kurdish hdp . 
  this was most likely done by a turkish ultranationalists , these fascists are known for attacking and terrorizing the kurdish people . 
  just a few weeks ago , they lynched a kurdish man because he was wearing a kurdish costume . 
  important to note , the criminals who did this were not taken to jail .

  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34193733 and on top of that , turkish snipers have killed many kurdish civilians last week in cizre . 
  turkish people lynching a kurdish man after he posed a picture with kurdish clothes : http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/kurdish-man-forced-to-kiss-ataturk-statue-in-southwest-turkey.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=88198&amp;newscatid=341 after that , the perpetrators were found but not charged by anthing . 
  attacking kurds is normal in turkey unfortunately . 
  turkish people attacking hdp buildings and the police is helping them : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34193733 turkish terrorist army kills more than 20 civilians and all the perpetrators are free of charge http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34215301, 
   considering your history i 'd say you are more kurdish than french lol . 
  looks like your mom grow you up as a kurd and you dad went `` whatever it doesnt matter '' or something like that . 
  the f ? 
  lol . 
  i 've always said i 'm a french guy with kurdish heritage , but i consider myself french before anything else . 
  why are you butthurt about my ethnicity by the way ? 
  oh now i see , you are a racist turk who hates kurdish identity . 
  https://www.reddit.com/user/justretardedthings  at . 
  you are one of the `` good '' examples of why diaspara nationalism is bad thing if you ask me . 
  you supported caliphate rebellions in a thread just because it was kurdish rebellions , meanwhile always talk about how isis is bad . 
  i supported kurdish rebellions against mass murdere ataturk because ataturk killed more than 13 000 civilians , and ordered the rape and murder of children : http://www.massviolence.org/dersim-massacre-1937-1938  d. please , they are both same , ( even if you ignore it ) one couldnt won first rebellions to grow , other one was free to do whatever he want . 
  this is funny considering that your terrorist country turkey is now run by an islamist which gets the majority of turkish votes . 
  and funny that i never heard you say 1 word about how turkish terrorist state killed more than 20 kurdish civilianshttp : / / www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34215301, 
  im not kurdish ignorant man . 
  my dad is french , im born in french and i am white . 
  my mum is kurdish but im not being subjective , im against kurdish immigration to europe too . 
  how the f can africa keep growing with that many poor people there ? 
  destroying your country 's culture and demographics is called '' cultural progress '' in sweden . 
  damn , the more i read from sweden the more i feel sorry for you guys . 
  it 's also important to note that turkey has been killing more than 20 civilians this week in cizre . 
   there is no kurdish identity , just iranic nomads . 
  when has has their been a.kurdish state ? 
  i 'm going to report you . 
  this is pure racism and fascism . 
  but on your racist note , there have been several kurdish emirates/semi-states , baban dynasty , soran dynasty and hakkari dynasty . 
  also , the founder of modern iran , shah ismail i , was half kurdish and the zand dynasty controlled iran for many years . 
  kurds have to flee their homes because turkish state terrorism forces them , terrorist state turkey killed 20 kurdish civilians only the last week already . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34215301 unfortunately , way too less kurds support the pkk resistance . 
  too many kurds believe in turkish propaganda while not seeing how kurds are being slaughtered by the turkish police and terrorist military . 
   in 1924 , while the `` issue of mosul '' was on the table , sheikh said began to organize the sheikh said rebellion . 
  sheikh said was a wealthy kurdish hereditary chieftain ( tribal chief ) of a local naqshbandi order . 
  piran emphasized the issue of religion ; he not only opposed the abolition of the caliphate , but also the adoption of civil codes based on western models , the closure of religious orders , the ban on polygamy , and the new obligatory civil marriage . 
  piran stirred up his followers against the policies of the government , which he considered to be against islam . 
  in an effort to restore islamic law , piran 's forces moved through the countryside , seized government offices and marched on the important cities of elaz\u0131\u011f and diyarbak\u0131r . 
  i agree with you that the caliphate should n't be revived , but do you agree with me that the fascist turkish supremacy policy of ataturk is wrong too ? 
  that he should n't have ordered the murder of children ? 
  [ ataturk was one of the biggest inspirations of hitler ] ( http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=97806743683780 ) do you agree with me that forced assimilation is wrong and that ataturk should have created a country for both turks and kurds and not a country based on turkish supremacy which unfortunately kurds [ have still to suffer from ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34193733 ) ? 
   there was n't democracy until later because people were backwards and insisted on wanting the caliphate and sharia , right after democracy came an islamist party came to power with adnan menderes who was a piece of shit . 
  so it was for a good reason that they waited . 
  so first you are blaming that kurds did n't want a democracy , and then when i countered you showing that turks did n't want it either , now we can agree that both ataturk 's dictatorship and islamism is wrong ? 
  sheikh said rebellion was done ** after ** ataturk said that his new supremist state had no room for kurdish identity . 
  he said that kurds were people who forgot their identity , acting like kurds were turkish which is the biggest bullshit and fascist thing ever since kurds speak an indo-european language while turks speak a turkic language . 
  so now you come with '' kurds didnt choose democracy in ** 1920 ** '' , no they didnt , but turks didnt either because the murderous ataturk never installed a true democracy but installed a dictatorship with only chp as a ruling party , no other party was allowed . 
  it was n't like kurds had a choice between choosing to revive the ottoman empire ( and saving kurdish identity ) or anything else . 
  it was either rebel against turkish supremacy or be forced to assimilate . 
  they were mad at ataturk because ataturk refused to acknowledge the kurdish identity and said that kurds didnt exist , that was the real reason . 
  [ also , nice video of turkish soldiers collaborating with isis terrorists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjn7zpzym1c ), 
   so the is . 
  the kurds wanted the same thing that the is wants . 
  it 's funny that you try to make kurds as isis while it 's erdogan who openly calls that '' muslims discovered america '' and literally supports terrorist jihadist organizations like ahrar ash sham and al qaeda http://www.ibtimes.com/turkey-may-have-found-syrian-horse-back-ahrar-al-sham-us-disagrees-1903065, 
  so you are saying , because some pkk members dress as civilians , turkey is free to kill every kurdish civilian because he * could * be pkk ? 
  is that really what you are saying ? 
  you 're the same guy who denies that kurds are being oppressed and that racism exists in turkey , here for you , turks chanting '' we want a massacre [ against kurds ] https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/3kduse/turkish_nationalists_in_istanbul_chant_we_want_no/ according to hrw , turkey has displaced millions of kurds and killed thousands with them , destroying even the littlest things they had like farm crops because they refused to be a criminal village guard . 
  the kurds who wanted the caliphate back did n't want it back because they were jealous of democracy , it was because they knew of thing else . 
  back then there was nothing like democracy in the middle east .
