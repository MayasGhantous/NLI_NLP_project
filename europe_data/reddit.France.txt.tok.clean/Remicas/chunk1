whatever you do , do n't * sell * helicopter carrier to russia . 
  while playing the * ode to joy * ** loud enough to be heard from earth . 
  i know , we even made [ a song about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9fem9gmom ) . 
  sadly we took apollinaire 's poem and not the real deal . 
   vladimir , the first of his name , tsar of all the russias , protector of the realm , defender of the faith , liberator of crimea , savior of south ossetia , crusher of the chechen , prince of the kgb , bear rider , not-friend-at-all of the gays , champion of the olympics , father of the motherland , also known as `` the dickhead '' . 
  fixed . 
   imperialists/traditionalists/extreme ( fringe ) conservatives/homphobic/anti-western / backward . 
  in one word : morons . 
  it 's those damn cathares all over again . 
  burn them !, 
  estonia ca n't expand in the three other dimension , so the fourth one is the only logical choice . 
  it comes farther back than that . 
  a white cross ( akin to the red english cross ) was used during the late medieval period by the french army , and the color white was also used during the italian wars . 
  they tried to make a constitutional monarchy at first . 
  did n't work out . 
  so instead of becoming a figurehead , the head of state became headless . 
  never read it , but i 've spend enough time lurking on tvtropes to learn some things . 
  even 70 year olds they still look like they can kick your ass six ways to sunday . 
  they hated the people ( especially the `` antechrist '' napoleon ) , but loved the culture . 
  1815 was a failure , true , but the 1812 or 1940 campaigns were true epic fails . 
  the nazi party was funded in 1920 . 
  that 's the nazis for you , destroying everything they touch since 1920 . 
  nope , i 'm living in britanny myself . 
  just a friend i know from internet . 
  i know a frenchman living in iceland who does . 
  does that count ? 
  how bad must be russian nazis . 
  yeah , only isis can save us from the ukrainian nazis . 
  yeah , first the statue of liberty , now this !, 
  why do we keep giving awesome gifts to jerks we do n't like ? 
  my thoughts , exactly . 
  the only reasons , really . 
  of course , because the french grabbed it during the revolution and applied their laws there . 
  when belgium became a country they certainly did n't care enough to ban it again . 
  de gaulle 's role in ww2 was more political than miliary , true , but it 's his accomplishment if by the end of the war france was considered a victor against germany and japan . 
  laziness is what made the modern world . 
  maybe he has a point , but he do n't have to be a dick about it . 
  his language is far more flowery , he literally say the french do n't give a shit about the kurds , and if they want to protest against daech they should get the fuck out of france to fight them in kurdistan , or this gem  `` do n't take us for morons , mister-who-is-not-french '' . 
  i ` ts really odd the police prefect 's secretary ( more or less is job ) would say things that way ( there 's plenty of way to tell people to fuck off while seeming polite in french ) , he sounds more like nicolas sarkozy than a professionnal here . 
  what are they going to do ? 
  shoot at the virus ? 
  no we need a country which flag descend from greenland 's , but switching for a cross to go full circle . 
  heavy censorship i guess . 
  you can do like us , go full nuclear . 
  the battle was pretty much lost before p\u00e9tain came to power anyway , but yeah he really put the nail to the coffin . 
  and even then some units carried on the fight after the armistice was signed , either because their communications were blocked or , you know , honor and all . 
  also he was against the war against europe , the annexation of various place like avignon , against the trial of louis the xvith ( according to him , the fact he was overthrown by the people was enough ) and so on . 
  it was n't until he came to power that his sanity break , and again it 's hard to just blame him alone for the terror with the complexity of the time , he was n't the only member of the commitee of public safety and still had to answer to the convention . 
  impossible is still not french . 
  by the way there are precedents : the last defenders of hitler 's bunker were members of the ss division charlemagne , composed of frenchmen . 
  damn spiteful and filthy french !, 
  military . 
  economy . 
  diplomacy . 
  culture . 
  only the eu can master all four elements and bring balance to the world . 
  i already knew two out of three existed ( faroese and saami ) . 
  not their characteristics , just that they * are * , but still not bad . 
  of course , i did get the joke but come on xd, 
  there 's really subs for anything ... 
  europa !, 
  europa !, 
  really catchy , i like it . 
  implying americans know europe 's geography . 
  #weareallfilthyfrench should be a thing . 
  germany , here i come . 
  wait , i do n't speak german  <, 
  egypt still a lot into cat . 
  did saint-pierre-et-miquelon get independance without anyone noticing ? 
  i believed it was still a dust of our overseas empire . 
  thanks reminding me the existence of this crappy movie . 
  no , westeros is a reverse great-britain , http://i.imgur.com/s4inh.png, 
  go home netherlands , you 're drunk . 
  19 - a directory for escort girls in paris . 
  because we fail to make an ever closer union , so instead we 'll make an ever larger union . 
  and aparently serbia is not part of yougoslavia and is further north than i believed . 
  well  daesh is a loose acronym of the arabic for `` islamic state of iraq and the levant '' ( al - ** d ** awla ** a ** l-islamiya al-iraq al - ** sh ** am ) so they 're still calling it isis by the arabic equivalent . 
  the fact it can be use to insult them is a bonus . 
  le chant du d\u00e9part also comes from the revolution , actually . 
  if you want a patriotic song from ww1 , there is `` verdun - on ne passe '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj3n02cqjiu, 
  tolkien was right . 
  a bear . 
  we do n't care about scotland as long as we beat england . 
  well , `` fist '' in french is usually used in some sexual activities ... 
  bavaria will defends us from matriarchy !, 
  not her cousin , her son . 
  france has children all over the world , but the relations are somewhat tense generally . 
  still the quebecquois and french are cousins . 
  how it 's possible is anyone 's guess . 
  * si tu ne suis pas **  still good if by your own recognition your french is elementary . 
  we should annex belgium , that 'd teach them . 
  edit : by them , i mean the tax escapees . 
  yes . 
  yes . 
  if those fuckers managed to get killed in ukraine , i 'd say good riddance . 
  of course not , but using it as an argument to entitle themself to do exactly the same is not really great either . 
  hahaha , touch\u00e9 , 
  why do n't they do as the coins , keep the same thing on one side and whatever the country printing them want on the other ? 
  an almost naked guy spanking a horse in front of a beheaded giant ... way to go , greece . 
  hard to get sarcasm from text , my bad .
