  tremble , ennemies of france , kings drunk with blood and pride !, 
  the sovereign people comes forth ; tyrants come down to the grave !, 
  ( and it 's just the first verse ), 
  also french dragoons rode actual dragons . 
  la when the word is feminine and le when it is masculine . 
  discount on our king , now 10 % less !, 
  it 's a bit scary that my first thought was `` damn , we need more launchers '' ... 
  on a second thought , do n't go down !, 
  do not go down , asshole !!, 
  well , shit ... 
  good tastes . 
  homophobes of all countries , unite !, 
  or not , apparently . 
  mais quelques pauvres \u00e2mes n'ont m\u00eame pas leur propre drapeau ( i put drapeau in singular as you did it for flag ) . 
  not that bad actually , i mistook you with u/bahatost . 
  yes . 
  it 's a trap !, 
  absolutely nothing . 
  too much humidity , fire wo n't start . 
  ps , it 's brittany , mate . 
  heatwave ? 
  what heatwave ? 
  on the pros side , the english could n't deny they 're europeans anymore . 
  in the comic , sure , but the cartoon is kid-friendlier . 
  edit : i 'm not saying one is better than the other , just that dbz is more violent . 
  and it is fine . 
  no one ever dies in lucky luke , while krillin alone must have died half a dozen times . 
  do n't forget island germans . 
  thanks , disney . 
  secret de polichinelle maintenant ... 
  wrong accent . 
  prodigue ! = prodige . 
  ... we already knew that ... 
  i would n't put industrial and military spying on the same level as spying on allied governments . 
  [ is n't there already a base on the moon ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2cs8wvqhi ), 
  i read it with a deep , wh40k dreadnought 's voice . 
  going back to the future . 
  there are more than one ireland ?!, 
  basically . 
  ... against other french . 
  also you ask about defending paris , not successfully defending paris . 
  first and second marne battle . 
  germany was stuck in a two front war exactly because so many french ( and a few but still decisive british ) were defending paris . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_paris_ ( 1870 % e2 % 80 % 9371 ), 
  you say that because he said hungary is irrelevant . 
  romania also is . 
  i agree , we despise only england but like scotland and wales . 
  we know they hate us cause they ai n't us . 
  so we do n't really care . 
  not hard as everyone completly forget it exists most of the time . 
  : or do n't even know to begin with . 
  not really , no . 
  unless you want to get slapped , of course . 
  better uniforms . 
  the fact that the american founding fathers took inspiration from french philosophers is pretty well known . 
  had russia won , we could send bearded lady straight to moscow next year . 
  missed opportunity . 
  no , i am saying `` they were stupid , and thus they died '' . 
  not `` they were stupid , so they should die '' . 
  i am blaming their death on their own stupidity , not justifying their death due to their stupidity . 
  at no point i said what happened to them was deserved , only that it was the results of their own actions , and not the ones of the police . 
  '' ( p32/38 ) they did n't saw them entering the site . 
  they saw them entering a wooded area next to the site , and made the assumption they were going to enter the site . 
  and then when they arrested two suspects in the cemetery , they assumed they were the same persons they saw entering the wooded area . 
  come on , that 's not so hard to understand . 
  stupidity has nothing to do with wealth or skin color . 
  except children of wealthy white people do n't ran away when they see the police in general . 
  also you forgot the complete sentence : '' * if * they entered into the edf site , i guess they wo n't last long . '', 
  conditionnal . 
  they were n't sure at that point , and did n't saw them directly entering the site . 
  depends if you count hookers and blackjack as part of the economy . 
  well , when you enter a building on which is written `` do not enter : danger of death '' and die , you ca n't really blame the police . 
   fran\u00e7ois ** e ** hollande ... 
  your country 's nickname is * perfidious albion * , do n't be surprised when people think you 're unreliable . 
  sure he must have had lustful thoughts . 
  * french ( native ) * english ( b2 ) * spanish ( learned in middle and highschool , forgot most of it and trying to relearn it ), 
  * un tout petit peu * sounds better , otherwise not bad . 
  we 're talking about first names , not family names . 
  good riddance . 
  bir hakeim do n't real . 
  monte cassino do n't real . 
  provence landing do n't real . 
  french resistance do n't real . 
  rhine to danube campaign do n't real . 
  normandie-niemen squadron do n't real . 
  i 'm afraid of how much we love to hate them . 
  they 're morons . 
  those no-go zones are called restaurants , and we have good reasons for not wanting people born in england there . 
  what . 
  the . 
  as if we needed integrist catholics now . 
  where is turreau when you need him . 
  edit : by the way , [ he ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/johann-dietrich_w%c3%b6rner ) is german indeed . 
  that 's the eastern front for you . 
  the whole theatre was insane .
