  [ ode to joy intensifies ], 
  they are fed up with always shooting at the same synagogues and wanted to change for once ? 
  jihadists do n't shine by their intellignence usually ( at least not the thugs who do commit the attacks ) . 
  or the strategy could be precisely to tear the muslims and the christians apart to reinforce their `` us against them '' mentality . 
  this is absurd . 
  the guy was planning to attack one or two church ( while under surveillance from the police , which did n't see it coming as usual ) , killed one random woman , managed to shoot himself in the leg , and had to call an ambulance . 
  oh , and his car was stuffed with weapons and his plans . 
  he foiled his own plan all by himself . 
  that guy fails at terrorism so much , if there had not been a victim it would be laughable . 
  you know nothing , josh show . 
  one of the guys , the wounded one , was going to get married a few hours later . 
  you ca n't kill a guy the day of his wedding , that 's not civilised !, 
  dueling was banned under louis xiii , but the law was abolished ( with a lot of them ) during the revolution ( and nobles did n't stop killing each other anyway ) . 
  as a result , dueling became more democratized , and often used between members of the parliament ( georges clemenceau was a famous duelist , both with sword and pistol . 
  he fought in 12 duels ) . 
  it only became out of fashion after the first world war , because after so much death and destruction risking his life to avenge his honor was seen as pathetic , when you could defend it in court . 
  because it would be murder ? 
  they agreed to stop at first blood . 
  not in france . 
  if they need a neutral place we can arrange that . 
  so the poles were saved because even rats did n't want their food ? 
  haha , that 's not far from the truth , 
  the only french citizen saying he 's france i know was charles de gaulle , so i think we 'll make him president of the republic and renew with his cult of personality . 
  but , seriously , i do n't think i understand your question . 
  they left france to enroll themself in an organisation , which we are currently at war with , directly opposed to our values and calling to the death of [ `` spiteful and filthy french '' ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20140922/isis-urges-killing-of-spiteful-and-dirty-french ) citizens . 
  am i clear enough why i do n't consider them french ? 
  yeah , they are `` french '' . 
  personally i would rather call them traitors . 
  i do n't think they even consider themself french anyway . 
  terror without virtue is gruesome , virtue without terror is powerless . 
  i always think of robespierre as a tragic hero , a guy with wonderful ideas ( opposed to death penalty , wanted a more egalitarian society , dedicated to virtue and reason ) but the revolution was such a bloody mess that he snapped and went in `` fuck this , let 's just kill a whole lot of people '' mode . 
  also , in the `` universally hated person who hold power '' category , there 's pierre laval . 
  no , only agreeing with / u/beheska that any religion can be used as pretext for violence . 
  the inquisition was formed after the albigensian crusade , no muslim was involved . 
  also there were crusades in the baltics to expand christendom . 
  yeah i thought so . 
  thanks for the anecdote !, 
  is it a pun that does n't translate in other languages ? 
  because the title of marshall is a distinction and not a rank . 
  a marshall also gain a stick with blue velvet and 21 stars ( symbolising his whole career as it regroups all his stars , 2 +3 +4 +5 +7 = 21 ), 
  spain also has a tiny amount of land in africa , and france has a tiny amount of land in south america . 
  neither are african nor american countries . 
  it 's how we write his name . 
  it 's sound like it , and if we used the english latinisation it would look and sound a lot like * putain * , which literally mean in french `` whore '' . 
  they gatherned in london to mourn king edward vii , but they gathered in that * room * to pose for the camera . 
  the two are n't self-exclusive . 
  i think someone with skills should photoshop this pic to give these elegant fellows musical instruments . 
  if they had formed a band in their day , * mourning monarchs * would have been a perfect name . 
  a part of me find this idea awesome . 
  :d but seriously , no . 
  i think he meant you just made the understatement of the century concerning belgian colonial rule . 
  knowing the british they would consider it as just a minor inconvenience , as long as they can still drink tea . 
  it 's good to be the king indeed !, 
   may the force be with eu . 
  it 's at this line that i completly lost it . 
  brilliant . 
  i did n't know that at the time i responded ( simplequark already pointed it out that by the way ) . 
  the context helps to make more sense , so thank you . 
  you take it from elephants . 
  i 'd say pre - or during wwi , when germany still had colonies in africa . 
  the bearded belgian guy seems to be actually leopold ii as congo was basically his private property until the belgian government get its nose in the ruling of that country . 
  anyway , i do n't mind the way the `` franz\u00f6sisch '' way is portrayed , at least in a modern point of view . 
  making girls smile or kissing them seems pretty nice compared to literrally pressing them for money , train animals in a militaristic way ( interesting to point , it seems there 's no african in german africa ) or , well , eating people . 
  sure , interracial intercourse was n't really considered as something good i guess in germany at that time ( or europe at large , thanks social darwinism ) , and the french rule was n't so mild to begin with , but i find funny how , again for modern eyes , this german propaganda poster fails to antagonize the french or bring support to the german . 
  i kinow , i was merely joking ;-), 
  parisian 's french : montparnasse ? 
  you do n't want to know how complicated it was during the ancient r\u00e9gime . 
  sure , but bigar waterfall is bettar . 
  most of these buildings have large flat rooftops anyway , so it 's not a bad idea . 
  cancerous alien baby are known to give heart stroke . 
  we already knew about space , but time is a whole new thing . 
  there 's also a little hamlet called la mort aux juifs - death to the jews . 
  insults in english are lame and lack originality . 
  at least in french you have a wider range in the choice of cuss words ( and as demonstrated with the matrix , you can make pretty sweet combos ) . 
  you are not wrong , do n't worry . 
  `` on '' is an impersonal pronoun that can different meaning in french ( depending of what you want to tell , it can say either a kind of vague `` us '' , `` someone '' or an equally vague `` they '' , for exemple `` on dit que ... '' is translated as `` it is said that ... '' ) , so it make sentence strutures hard to translate in english . 
  in this case `` on ne passe pas '' is refering to a quote from general nivelle during the battle of verdun `` ils ne passeront pas '' ( they shall not pass , they being the germans here ) . 
  it became a rallying cry and propaganda slogan , using `` on '' reinforce characteristic of determination in the slogan , it 's not just `` they '' or `` you '' , but no one , period . 
  notably it inspired the republican during the spanish civil war , adapted as `` no pasaran ! '', 
  ( wich can mean , due to how spanish work , either you ( formal plural ) shall not pass or they shall not pass ) during the battle of madrid . 
  unfortunately for them , the nationalsts won the battle , after which franco smugly said `` hemos pasado '' ( we have passed ) . 
  anyhow , the black night is a good example , but i prefer using gandalf because that tolkien took part of ww1 in the battle of the somme and started writing * the silmarillon * around that time , was hugely inspired by the war . 
  to be honest in the fellowship of the ring ( book version ) gandalf say repetidly `` you can not pass '' to the balrog . 
  close enough , but the movies decided to make it sound more epic by changing it with `` you shall not '' . 
  fine !,

  please do , we can help with our * savoir-faire * if you want . 
  we 're almost ready , mcfly !, 
  do n't care , still beat britain . 
  maybe we can convince them to invade , say , new-zealand to protect their ethnic population there ? 
  if my grandmother did n't had an affair while married , my mother would n't have born . 
  to me it helps put things in perspectives . 
  also it 's a case of private life , it may sucks when it happen to you , but if it 's to other people it 's none of tout business . 
  i hope not . 
  alain jupp\u00e9 ( another lr ) made a speech that sounds a lot like a candidate for presidency though . 
  the mainstream parties should rethink about their politics , goals , ideas , and obtain satisfying results on them . 
  yeah , easier said than done .
