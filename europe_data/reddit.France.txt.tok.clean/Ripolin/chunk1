this is beautiful . 
  during the 2010 lisbon summit , [ nato ] ( http://www.nato.int/ ) adopted a new roadmap for the next 10 years , defining its objectives and priorities . 
  the [ * new strategic concept * ] ( http://www.nato.int/strategic-concept/pdf/strat_concept_web_en.pdf ) focuses mainly on ensuring peace and stability , not only within the euro-atlantic zone , but also all over the world , by developing newparternships and maintening deterrence . 
  does n't matter , we 're last in both of them . 
  the european citizenship goes along with any citizenship of a member state . 
  if you manage to be recognized as a spanish citizen , then you 'll get automatically the european citizenship . 
  i do n't know where you 're from , but you should contact the spanish embassy about this . 
  it would be [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijihdmyhe1a ) . 
  it 's the beautiful idea - certainly perfectible - of gathering all european countries in order to live together peacefully and avoid further wars between us . 
  it may sound utopistian , but i do believe that is the truth . 
  you can not just change the name like that . 
  and in any case , before integrating countries outside of europe , we have to enhance and deepen the ue to resolve all of our issues . 
  the european union is not * just * a name . 
  it 's so much more than that . 
  morocco applied , but the candidacy was rejected in 1987 . 
  canada as member-state is a weird idea . 
  it 's the european union , not the atlantic union . 
  i believe that creating or improving partnerships may be a better idea in order to strengthen our relations . 
  and it should apply to our neighboring countries , such as african countries . 
  the united nations high commissionner for refugees ( unhcr ) was created to deal with this situation . 
  according to the [ geneva convention of 1951 ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html ) , the notion of `` refugee '' was defined by the international community as a person who :  * ( 1 ) has been considered a refugee under the arrangements of 12 may 1926 and 30 june 1928 or under the conventions of 28 october 1933 and 10 february 1938 , the protocol of 14 september 1939 or the constitution of the international refugee organization ; decisions of non-eligibility taken by the international refugee organization during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section ; *  * ( 2 ) as a result of events occurring before 1 january 1951 and owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . 
  in the case of a person who has more than one nationality , the term `` the country of his nationality '' shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national , and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if , without any valid reason based on well-founded fear , he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national . 
  * but the most important point is the article 33 , concerning the `` non-refoulement '' :  * no contracting state shall expel or return ( `` refouler '' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  * in the case of hungarian refugees , after the crisis of 1956 , many of them were resettled in western countries ( 38 ' 000 in the usa , 35 ' 000 in canada , etc. ), 
  but some refugees also adopted for repatriation , encouraged by the ussr and the hungarian regime . 
  so nobody was automatically sent back to his/her country behind the iron curtain , except if they wanted to . 
  if you want more informations , i advise you to take a look on the [ the state of the world 's refugees 2000 : fifty years of humanitarian action ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/4a4c754a9.html ) . 
  in france , we have free mobile . 
  it provides 2 offers without commitment : ** 2 $ / month ( or 0 $ / month for subscribers of their internet/television/phone offer ) : ** * 2h phone calls to mobiles in france , usa , canada , alaska , hawa\u00ef , china , france overseas territories and to landlines of france and more than 100 countries . 
  * unlimited text messages in france and overseas territories * unlimited mms in france * unlimited freewifi * * internet 3g + 4g : 50mo ** 19,99 $ / month ( or 15,99 $ / month for subscribers of their internet/television/phone offer ) : ** * unlimited phone calls to mobiles in france , usa , canada , alaska , hawa\u00ef , china , france overseas territories and to landlines of france and more than 100 countries . 
  * unlimited text messages in france and overseas territories * unlimited mms in france * unlimited freewifi * * internet 3g : 3go / 3g + 4g : 20go ( with fair use after ) * * pass destination * : you can have phone calls , sms/mms unlimited + 3go internet for 35days/year/pass from the destination of the pass to the same destination and to france . 
  that pass includes germany , italy , netherlands , portugal and french overseas territories you have other companies which provide you more or less the same stuff , but if you 're already a subscriber of free , it 's really unbeatable , even if there 're still some issues with the coverage . 
  * freewifi is a service that allows you to take advantage of the wifi connexion of some free internet subscribers , creating a kind of community network . 
  it does n't usually reduce the bandwidth of these subscribers , but if you do n't want to share , you can deactivate it . 
  * ** edit : ** precision about freewifi, 
  in the same style , you have this [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iurk4by.jpg ) . 
  that 's really impressive !, 
  any ideas about the size of that mine ? 
  my phones are 3 and 1 years old . 
  except iphone , i believe that every phone released during these last years has a micro-usb connector . 
  it is a thing . 
  i remembered when [ each brand had its own charger ] ( http://www.hardwareinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/1452_usb_iphone_charger_3.gif ) , it was such a mess to find to right one to plug your phone when you had different brands in your house or between your friends . 
  i think that samsung was the worst one , with almost one charger for each phone . 
  in your everyday life , if you are careful , you can notice some of the eu decisions . 
  there are many of them : universal phone charger , common standards on goods ( food , electronic devices , pollution limits ) , etc. 
  nonetheless , i would say that the most important thing is shengen . 
  going to a non-shengen country seems so weird now , with all these custom controls and this time wasted ( crossing the greek-turkish border at night is probably one of the worst things i ever experienced ) . 
  i think this is something we do not fully appreciate . 
  poor benelux ... 
  i 'm sorry but these pictures have few things in common , either in form or content . 
  we learn exactly the same things in france about czech republic . 
   what about cyprus ? 
  what if told you that cyprus is already in the ue ? 
  the catapult is amazing . 
  i think you should ask ukrainians about that . 
  i 'm pretty sure they can recall perfectly when their heater is not working because the russian government decided to close some gas pipelines during winter . 
  it 's not capitalism . 
  for ukraine , it 's a sword of damocl\u00e8s related to their energy dependency . 
  for russia , it 's a powerful way of pressure . 
  how about threaten ukraine to close gas and oil pipelines ? 
  i would say yes , but that answer raises so much issues with a lot of contingencies : * will the member-states agree on an mutual intervention ? 
  * how much time will it take to negociate an agreement , and then to mobilise our contingents ? 
  * will it be an ue , un or nato operation ? 
  * and most important , will russia let us intervene ( if they 're not interfering by force before ) ? 
  funny , because russia is not interfering either ... 
  you 're right . 
  bonaparte seems pretty cool !, 
  let me add some french bands to that list !,

  ** [ french overseas territories ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/france_doutre-mer_2007_fr.png ) ** there are several legal status governing these territories : * * d\u00e9partement et r\u00e9gion d'outre-mer * : they are regional authorities similar to those of mainland france , ruled by the article 73 of the constitution . 
  it allows some derogations made necessary by the context . 
  among these dom , there are ** guadeloupe ** , ** martinique ** , ** guyane ** , ** la r\u00e9union ** and ** mayotte ** , which joined very recently ( in 2009 ) that group . 
  there are around 2 million inhabitants . 
  they have separatist claims but quite limited . 
  often , when there are demonstrations , it 's not because they want their independence , but because of some inequalities betwen mainland france and the dom , such as in 2009 . 
  [ ** french caribbean general strikes ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_french_caribbean_general_strikes ) * * collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer * : each overseas communities has a specific status . 
  there are the ** french polynesia ** , ** saint-pierre-et-miquelon ** , ** saint-barth\u00e9lemy ** , ** saint-martin ** and ** wallis-et-futuna ** . 
  their population is quite low ( under 30 ' 000 inhabitants ) , except for the french polynesia , with almost 240 ' 000 people . 
  the latter is the only one with a significant independence movement . 
  the united nations put it on their list of * territories to be decolonized * in 2012 , even in almost 70 % of polynesians want to keep their constitutionally granted autonomous status . 
  [ oscar temaru ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oscar_temaru ) is the leader of that struggle , but he failed to defeat the very controversial [ gaston flosse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaston_flosse ) . 
  the situation may change during the next years . 
  * * nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie * : it 's a * sui generis * territory with a shared sovereignty . 
  the constitution gives them specific status , with a lot of derogations . 
  i 'm not really familiar with their situation , so [ wikipedia may probably gives you better informations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_caledonia ) . 
  * * others * : they 're mainly territories without a significant population , such as [ antartic lands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terres_australes_et_antarctiques_fran%c3%a7aises ) or [ clipperton island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%8ele_de_clipperton ) . 
  if a french fellow sees any mistake here or has more precisions , please let me know !, 
  since mayotte became recently a * d\u00e9partement d'outre-mer * , i do n't think we can say that there is a significant independance movement . 
  it 's almost the same with new-caledonia . 
  the constitution of 1958 has a specific section for that territory , creating a kind of * federalism * . 
  the [ article 77 ] ( http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do;jsessionid=ccb2d91c10d4b37bbe8dd679229bb236.tpdjo04v_3?idsectionta=legiscta000006095844&amp;cidtexte=jorftext000000571356&amp;datetexte=20080724#legiarti000006527602 ) ( * sorry , it 's in french * ) details that special status , which limits independance claims . 
  breton independentists would love that map . 
  like the new 5 $ note , it really looks like a monopoly note . 
  i admit it . 
  it was a shame to be qualified in that way . 
  i think it 's even worse when you consider what happened to our team during the 2010 world cup ( knysna and all that shit ) . 
  by the way , i want to thank you for [ that awesome moment ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luoyyhlzeqk ) . 
  i do n't think there is a more classy way to be eliminated from an international competition . 
  in football , i would say france/italie . 
  the 2006 world cup was definitely ours .
