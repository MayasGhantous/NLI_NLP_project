  `` when paris sneezes , all europe catches a cold '' ~ metternich, 
  and a lot of them from the french media , which was pretty shameful . 
  even during the battle of france in 1940 , there were ( iirc ) 360 000 dead and wounded . 
  it 's not like the whole army surrendered after 2 days or shit . 
  it never bothers me when its on stuff like polandball or when it 's obvious it 's a joke . 
  but after that whole iraq war business , the anglo-americans reaaaally went overboard with it . 
    paris , the romantic city of love / / paris the festering islamist hellhole . 
   do you mean both are untrue ? 
  yep . 
  too many people idealise paris after seeing am\u00e9lie poulain or some shit , and then start bitching when they realise it 's also a metropolis of +2 million people ( 10 million if you count the whole urban area ) , with its own problems as every city . 
  and for the islamist hellhole thing , kinda goes without saying . 
  surrendering . 
  eating snails and frogs all the time . 
  paris , the romantic city of love / / paris the festering islamist hellhole . 
  ffs , will they never get over it ? 
  yeah , it 's not like a guy called george w. bush called a great crusade or anything . 
  i 'm a fairly left-wing person and i get extremely irritated at the french pc brigades , but the anglo-saxons are just insane . 
  even the `` survivor 's issue '' was branded as racist by these maniacs . 
  i 'm not a big fan of ch , not that i find them bad or anything , just very tame in my view . 
  but seeing the rest of the world getting butthurt every time one of their drawings gets media attention is priceless . 
  one for france : * [ the battle of verdun ] ( http://p4.storage.canalblog.com/44/65/1042402/83985625_o.jpg ) the longest battle in wwi ( it lasted from february to december 1916 ) . 
  the german army launched an assault on the fortified town of verdun , nearly broke through , were stopped by desperate french resistance . 
  then the french army counterattacked and were bogged down . 
  the total casualties range from 700 000 to 1 million men . 
  final result ? 
  * [ frenchman cries as paris is occupied by the nazis ] ( http://www.insoliteqc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/u3o1di4.jpg ) with [ this image of the liberation of paris ] ( http://www.ouest-france.fr/sites/default/files/styles/image-640x360/public/2014/07/21/il-y-70-ans-la-division-leclerc-liberait-paris.jpg?itok=u1ffr3rg ) . 
  the city was freed when the resistance rose up against the nazis and leclerc 's 2nd db entered the city . 
  ( i know , 2 images but they kinda tell the same story ) . 
  * [ charles de gaulle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/de_gaulle-owi.jpg ) ` nuff said . 
  * [ may 1968 ] ( http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2008/04/18/photo-1208525220121-1-0.jpg ) what started out as a student movement and became the biggest general strike ever . 
  * [ fran\u00e7ois mitterrand and helmut kohl hold hands at the site of the battle of verdun ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cruiser-production/2014/09/f29eb735-40a9-11e4-a580-005056a87fa3/870x489_de-la-mure3.jpg ) . 
  to me , the ultimate symbol of franco-german reconciliation , and friendship , upon which the eu was built . 
  * [ zin\u00e9dine zidane 's face projected on the arc de triomphe , 1998 ] ( http://www.football365.fr/medias/204467_.jpg ) after france won the world cup in 1998 , it led to the biggest public celebrations since the liberation . 
  * [ the french army in mali , 2013 ] ( http://cdn-parismatch.ladmedia.fr/var/news/storage/images/paris-match/actu/international/mali-l-honneur-retrouve-de-l-armee-francaise-162109/1703832-1-fre-fr/mali.-la-grandeur-retrouvee-de-l-armee-francaise.jpg ) i chose this because it kind of regroups nearly all the challenges that france faces now in the 21st century : our relevance or irrelevance as a world power , our colonial past , the struggle against radical islam , and even our economic problems ( as the army is spread extremely thin because of lack of resources ) . 
  i did go to bath and oxford . 
  but i was thinking manchester , birmingham and such . 
  that was 12 years ago . 
  nicolas `` my friends call me l'am\u00e9ricain '' sarkozy and fran\u00e7ois `` oh ok usa i wo n't sell the mistral to russia if it makes you upset '' hollande have done a lot so we can become pet n \u00b0 2 . 
  this . 
  i was shocked by how poor the rest of england ( have n't been to scotland , wales or n. ireland so ca n't tell ) seemed compared to london . 
  it 's like the divide between paris and the rest of france on steroids . 
  mostly it 's complete shit made by extremely cynical people . 
  one of tf1 's execs said publicly some time back that tf1 's job was to create `` available brain time '' for coca-cola . 
  despite that , it 's still france 's most-watched channel . 
  other channels are of the same level . 
  then you have the real idiocracy-tier channels like d8 and nrj12 . 
  public tv ( france 2 and especially lcp , but no-one watches lcp ) is somewhat better , especially their investigative programmes . 
  canal + used to be great , even a little subversive , with the brilliant guignols de l'info ( think spitting image with much darker humour ) and such , but over the years has become a shallow , mainstream , vaguely left-wing channel . 
  the ` yve been recently bought by bollor\u00e9 , one of sarkozy 's friends , who is now in the process of forcing canal + to commit suicide . 
  arte is the one shining light though . 
  raises an interesting question - how do brits feel about dan jarvis ? 
  seems to me like a vast improvement on mad corbyn and blairite robots burnham/cooper/kendall . 
  eh , renan is n't some `` random fucking author '' , his thoughts on the matter are the basis on france 's approach to nationality . 
  you 're free to your own understanding of it , it 's just not what the french mainstream has been for a century now . 
  just wanted to clear that up . 
  edit : did n't see the question . 
  when do you become french ? 
  i 'm a pretty old school republican , so my answer is that you become french when 1 ) you are legally french 2 ) you speak the language and share french values 3 ) you `` feel '' french and not anything else , and are willing to participate in the common destiny of the nation . 
  i 'm going to go full sherlock here and guess you do n't agree , which is fine , not that i care much . 
  also pretty much everybody in france would disagree with you , even marine le pen . 
  this should help : http://ucparis.fr/files/9313/6549/9943/what_is_a_nation.pdf, 
  to be fair , this was a pre-algerian independence statement , when some people were floating around the idea of equal rights for algerians . 
  in reality , there were large immigration waves in the 1960s ( the largest immigration wave in french history was in 1962 , i believe ) . 
  you do realise that marine le pen has brought the fn to unprecedented levels of electoral success ( bringing in its first mps since the 1980s * , even some senators , more mayors than ever , breaking the 20 % barrier ) and has attracted tons of new support ( the youth used to hate the fn ; now young people 's top party is the fn ; similarly with women ) ? 
  also nobody really cares about dieudonn\u00e9 in the general population . 
  * the 1980 's do n't count as much because mitterrand specifically implemented proportional representation to bring in as many fn mps as he could to split the right-wing, 
  in the french republican conception of citizenship , the republic is `` one and undivided '' : there can be no distinction based on race , gender or colour . 
  the citizen is to be considered only on the basis of his belonging to the national political community , not his origins or anything else . 
  this is why `` ethnic statistics '' have always been forbidden , why affirmative action based on race is an extremely hot issue ( and only really exists for women in the political sphere ) . 
  the constitutional council some years back censored a law that referred to `` the corsican people '' , stating that there was no such thing as a `` corsican people '' only a `` french people '' . 
  in the same way , the court said that there are no `` fran\u00e7ais de souche '' , only french citizens . 
  hi and thank you for this ama . 
  * the european parliament is often criticised for being powerless , or only being able to amend texts on purely technical points . 
  we also saw during the last european elections that angela merkel and others said that the results would not dictate their choice for the eu commission president . 
  so my question is , what do you think , as an mep , blocks the parliament from being a real , democratic assembly of the european people , and what can be done to change it ? 
  * quite often when debating with eurosceptics , i find that i do n't really have any good arguments pointing to good things the eu has done , apart from erasmus . 
  as you will be a key figure in the referendum debate in the uk , what main arguments are you planning to use ? 
  * marielle de sarnez ( i suppose you know her ) stated that she believed in * l'europe en cercles concentriques * , with different rules for different blocs in the eu . 
  is n't this a dangerous and divisive idea , especially for eastern european member states ? 
  anyways , thanks again !, 
  eh , the mongols were big on promoting religious freedom , were n't they ? 
  as i said : i guess the reasoning behind the questions is to find very basic awareness instead of in-depth knownledge , the assumption being that if somebody ca n't answer those questions , there 's a big chance they 're not that aware of the eu 's workings . 
  i myself do n't agree too much with this assumption , though . 
  is the election of the european parliament a pointless fact ? 
  also , on what grounds can you say that certain countries are just `` irrelevant '' ? 
  also i do n't put any particular value on these facts , just that i thought that european elections and switzerland not being in the eu was common knowledge . 
   who gives a shit about such completely irrelevant questions ? 
  the election of the european parliament is n't really irrelevant . 
  unless of course you 're in the `` oh , politics change nothing , i 'm too cool for that '' category . 
   do you know how many synaptic connections there are between the mechanical sensors in your finger tips and your neocortex ? 
  and what molecules the vesicles in those synapses release ? 
  what ? 
  you do n't know that ??? 
  how can you possibly live ? 
  you are using those connections almost every second !, 
  i never said you could n't possibly live or anything . 
  just that it seems bizarre to me not to know that the european parliament is elected by the people . 
   do you know where the turks come from ? 
  and when ? 
  it 's kind of important , i tell you !,
