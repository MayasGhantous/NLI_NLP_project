  as you pointed out , there are a few people who want no abortion rights without wanting to recitify the social consequences of that . 
  i was talking specifically about the idea that because it 's `` not that important '' ( who are you to judge , by the way ? ), 
  and `` does n't affect that many people '' there 's no need to get into a fit about it . 
  which , i feel , is n't very sound . 
  having an unwanted child does n't just `` inconvenience '' ( what a poor choice of words for the ordeal that a pregnancy is ) you for 9 months . 
  your absolute whole life is completely and utterly ruined . 
  wanted to pursue your studies ? 
  fuck that . 
  wanted to have a career in something special ? 
  fuck that too . 
  you get to be a single mom with an unwanted baby from your rapist for the rest of your life . 
   people act like women are being enslaved or disenfranchised or something . 
  in reality the overwhelming majority of people will not have their lives changed one bit by this . 
  what a completely idiotic logic . 
  if tomorrow there was a law specifically curtailing the rights of black people , i would n't be affected and the vast majority would n't be affected . 
  but it would still justify all kinds of `` hysteria '' . 
  not aborting it would also be punishing the wrong person , e.g. 
  the unwilling mother . 
  i think it 's more of a case of / r/europe not always being interested in space . 
  a lot of people , even those i did n't think would be interested in space , were pretty aware of rosetta/philae . 
   the main purpose of the eu is free trade . 
  yeah , no . 
  never was , never will be . 
  the main purpose of the eu was always to be a political project of union between the people of europe , free trade being nothing more than a means to that end . 
  it 's not a french demand , it 's something asked by a few inbred cunts whose great-great-great grandparents got lucky in 1793 . 
  also charles x was an absolute idiot of a monarch . 
  well of course , obviously corporate interests are paramount and should n't be affected by lowly plebeian things like democracy . 
  it 's taking a bit of tie because the name has to be chosen by voters . 
  ah yes , jean-claude juncker , well-known trotskyist . 
   the eu votes the most against the uk , and therefore votes the most against the uk 's interests and as such has a disregard for the well being of the uk . 
  you , as so many euroskeptics , fail to understand that the eu is n't an artificial monster with a mind of its own . 
  the eu is made up of his member states . 
  and in eu council meetings , member states vote . 
  not some nefarious bureaucrats , but elected leaders . 
  i know , i know , i knooooow, 
  friendship ended with uk , now mexico is my best friend, 
  well , luckily i have a subscription . 
  long article so i wo n't post it unless it 's requested , but here are the crucial parts for this discussion :  c\u2019est un petit carnet qui pourrait bien devenir le pire cauchemar de nicolas sarkozy . 
  basically says that the legal authorities were just recently able to obtain this diary . 
  also `` air cocaine '' is very badly represented . 
  no judge actually said that sarkozy was involved in drug trafficking . 
  he was being investigated for `` abus de bien social '' at the time about his links with businessman st\u00e9phane courbit who paid for some of his trips after 2012 . . with the same airline convicted in the air cocaine case . 
  the legal investigation has been ongoing for some time , and mediapart have been going on about these links for a long time as well . 
  back in 2012 they published documents according to which gaddafi had financed sarkozy 's campaign in 2007 , but their authenticity is still debated . 
  the diary is new evidence that has surfaced , and mediapart reported on it when they go the info , i assume . 
  not everything is a conspiracy against sarkozy , you know . 
  mediapart has been talking about links between sarkozy and gaddafi for years now . 
  i mean , [ so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_battle_of_zurich ) [ did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_austerlitz ) [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_friedland ) , [ and ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_eylau ) [ not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_smolensk_ ( 1812 ) [ just ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_borodino ) [ once ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_malakoff ) . 
  not really a reveal , is it ? 
  it 's been his mo for 10 years now . 
  the book is much more interesting with other revelations ( for example that sarkozy deliberately let riots hapoen ) . 
  also fun note but the guy who wrote that book was one of his closest advisers and incidentally a genuine fascist who wrote a book about eroticism and sex during the nazi occupation . 
   nobody expects the french ~ ~ inquisition ~ ~ [ revolutionary tribunal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_tribunal ) !, 
  ftfy, 
  somehow , in the brexiter 's view , it 's the eu 's fault if their politicians lied to them in the 1970s about the rome treaty . 
  the seemingly unbridgeable split between france and germany 's foreign policy and approach to defense is what makes me very skeptical of any plans for an eu army . 
  that 's out of contingence rather than long term . 
  because of the uk not willing to be as active , especially regarding syria , whereas hollande has been pretty hawkish over the middle east . 
  but in the long term , and when you look at the fundamentals , the uk is still by far the usa 's most important ally , way more than france will be ( or wants to be , for that matter ) . 
  why would you want informal negotiations ? 
  invoke article 50 and then we can start talking . 
  no need for any hidden bullshit , is there ? 
  you 're basically asking the eu to compromise on a basic freedom granted by its treaties . 
  this is n't about the rebate , or the uk 's contribution , or the power distribution between member states or whatever . 
  this is asking the eu to compromise * on one of its absolute core principles * . 
  the eu is n't just a free trade zone , it never was meant to be only that , it was always a political project , and british people just have to deal with it . 
  so you want access to the single market ? 
  fine , but if goods and capital can move freely , so can people . 
  the british position has never been about being mutually beneficial . 
  it has always been `` how can we reap the benefits without the consequences ? '', 
  how can we get access to the single market but not pay a penny for it , or accept that if uk goods and people can travel freely , then the others may do so as well also big fucking lol at the capitalism vs socialism thing , yeah sure the eu is a socialist project . 
  you 're being slightly delusional . 
  um no , that was a major disagreement on the issue . 
  whatever . 
  we got the rafale out of it , and it 's an amazing plane . 
  i mean : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54pj42/uk_defence_minister_we_are_going_to_continue_to/d83wya7, 
  there are around 50 or so cases every year . 
  it 's hardly nothing . 
  if they think they can pull it off , of course corporations will sue . 
  philip morris is n't especially evil or anything . 
  not to mention the deterrent effect of the existence of a parallel justice system for corporations . 
  [ it 's not science fiction . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/26/ttip-chevron-lobbied-for-controversial-legal-right-as-environmental-deterrent ), 
  wo n't come by irritating everyone in europe either but that 's beside the point . 
  i was just countering the point made that the eu was preventing the uk from leaving . 
  wealth redistribution means higher taxes means , in this case , making you less competitive and attractive and thus in the end making you much poorer . 
  ttip , for example , will invariably be very destructive , for example for what remains of our industry . 
  those jobs wo n't survive . 
  to this , free trade advocates simply repeat their textbooks , saying that it creates white-collar jobs and that all in all the workforce gets redeployed . 
  but it conveniently forgets that most of the people who get shafted wo n't be easily able to transfer to a white-collar job . 
  nor will areas facing big job losses recover easily , if at all . 
  in some cases , a whole city 's economy depends on the local plant - when that goes , then the city itself will collapse inevitably . 
  they lost , but they still sued , also stopping new zealand from implementing the same policy for a while . 
  you said that in those scenarios no corporation would ever sue . 
  yeah , i 'm not denying that , but at that point we really needed a new carrier-based fighter . 
  i 'm just saying that was the main reason we left the eurofighter project . 
  not as good living in slovenia , i 'm sure . 
  well of course , a brexit meant they lost their bridgehead in europe . 
  and there 's a difference between the uk government and its people . 
  it 's the uk that 's not invoking article 50 , the rest of europe is asking you do it promptly .
