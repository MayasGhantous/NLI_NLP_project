  a good cop/bad cop relationship , if you will . 
  at least from what i read . 
  ( though i was talking more world politics than european politics ) . 
  countries such as france or the uk ca n't take over the usa 's role in the protection of eastern europe , mainly because we do n't have the money , but especially because in terms of national defense , we 're pretty much covered by our nuclear deterrent ( especially us , as our nuclear deterrent doctrine is fucking insane ) . 
   not to mention the desolate lack of solidarity on ukraine when shit was hitting the fan there until we came in to give you guys some breathing room to re-group eh . 
  the ukraine situation got somewhat better once the `` normandy format '' was found - quadripartite meetings between putin , hollande , merkel and poroshenko , without the usa . 
  depends on the issue to be honest - whenever you talk international politics and military affairs , then germany is n't really top dog ( partly because a lot of germans do n't really care ) . 
  i think european policy as a whole has been moving towards a strict separation of `` real '' refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants . 
  of course , in the case of syria where it 's a whole population being persecuted ... 
  the lack of quantification is a problem . 
  however it looks at the european level - eu meetings and negotiations and the like . 
  in more general terms , yes , hollande is more powerful than renzi . 
  but in the last year or so , hollande has been pretty weak on the european stage ( especially regarding the refugee crisis ) . 
  and on the economy , especially standing up to german-imposed austerity , renzi and other italian leaders have stepped up . 
  especially jarring as standing up to austerity was supposed to be hollande 's thing . 
  also , he 's entering his final year as president , so there 's that as well . 
  hell , i 'd be ready to argue that right now , renzi may be somewhat more influential in eu dealings than david cameron ( every day the brexit gets closer , every day europe is getting used to the idea that the uk will leave ) . 
  ( of course , the `` matrix '' balances it out in theory by weighing in the ambassador to the eu . 
  looks like we got this one covered ) . 
  true . 
  kinda shot ourselves in the foot with that one . 
  maghreban countries are relatively stable though . 
  yes , but immigration agreements do exist . 
  spain has one with morocco , and we also had one with libya . 
  um , yeah , that 's also what i was talking about . 
  when i talked about `` hotspots '' , i meant `` the most important launching points from north africa '' . 
  obviously needs to be done in cooperation with morocco , algeria , tunisia ( was going to say libya but that 's a shitstorm ) . 
  maybe this time listen to italy and not ignore adequate border protection in the mediterranean ? 
  the way i see it , we ca n't sustain such a massive influx , and obviously nobody wants africans to drown in the sea . 
  can we not identify the `` hotspots '' on the north african coasts and act directly there ? 
  we do have agreements with north african countries on this ... 
  some guy , sorry , an ** alleged ** israeli `` security expert '' is saying that there 's an ** alleged ** super-duper high tech gizmo that can stop terrorist attacks , but that france ** allegedly ** refused it because we hate israel or something ( that 's a new one , btw ) . 
  oh , and this ** alleged ** miracle technology was shared with the usa . 
  strange that it did n't stop the san bernardino attacks , though . 
  another fine piece of reporting from fox news , ** allegedly ** a news organization . 
  was n't naz shah the one who managed to escape from an arranged marriage in pakistan , and then went on to beat that asshole galloway in the general election ? 
  fucking shame , she seemed ok . 
  that 's ... pretty much what some people want for the turkish constitution . 
  i looked around european constitutions , here are a few highlights : poland :  we , the polish nation - all citizens of the republic , both those who believe in god as the source of truth , justice , good and beauty , as well as those not sharing such faith but respecting those universal values as arising from other sources , equal in rights and obligations towards the common good - poland , beholden to our ancestors for their labours , their struggle for independence achieved at great sacrifice , for our culture rooted in the christian heritage of the nation and in universal human values ( ... )  recognizing our responsibility before god or our own consciences , interestingly enough it recognizes both believers and non-believers . 
  slovakia :  we , the slovak nation , mindful of the political and cultural heritage of our forebears , and of the centuries of experience from the struggle for national existence and our own statehood , in the sense of the spiritual heritage of cyril and methodius and the historical legacy of the great moravian empire latvia :  since ancient times , the identity of latvia in the european cultural space has been shaped by latvian and liv traditions , latvian folk wisdom , the latvian language , universal human and christian values . 
  ( ... ) god , bless latvia !, 
  also interesting , neither spain nor italy have any reference to god . 
  a lot of european monarchies refer to god only when mentioning `` whatshisname , by the grace of god king of ... '' . 
  france is supposedly the hardcore secular country , but even we could n't resist getting a bit of god in there . 
  the preamble of the constitution mentions the declaration of the rights of man of 1789 , giving it constitutional weight ( for all intents and purposes , it is part of our constitution ) which itself states :  in consequence , the national assembly recognizes and declares , in the presence and under the auspices of the supreme being , the following rights of man and of the citizen ... ( lots of other fun things in european constitutions . 
  i like how a lot of eastern european countries basically give you a short history of the country in preamble , or how portugal states that its objective is to become a socialist state , or that italy says it 's a country based on labor , heh ) . 
  comparative constitutional law is fun . 
  a lot of european constitutions are n't extremely secular either . 
  germany 's constitution mentions the german people 's responsability to god in its preamble . 
  that 's a recent development . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.diploweb.com/l-europe-vue-des-etats-unis,1447.html ) is a pretty interesting paper on the issue ( in french , sorry ... ) and it raises some interesting points . 
  first , that the usa 's attitude towards european political unity , especially in matters of defense , has evolved a lot . 
  - basically , in the post-war period , they supported a strong european defense in the face of communism . 
  this is the time of the marshall plan , of the european defense community , of west german rearmament , and the beginning of the eec . 
  - in the 1970 's , us strategy did a u-turn and the goal to prevent europe from uniting any further , so europe could n't become `` emancipated '' from us dominance . 
  the point here was to keep a direct control in european affairs by dealing with every country on a case-by-case basis . 
  - after the cold war , the focus switched back to supporting unity , though under nato 's umbrella . 
  - the bush administration went straight back to dividing europe , especially with the `` old europe / new europe '' rhetoric . 
  remember the usa supported the 2004 eu enlargement to eastern europe ( sorry to all you guys out there , but i still think doing it in one go was a mistake , and it should have been done gradually ) , which was in retrospect a huge leap in the dark for the eu . 
  - obama 's policy seems to be back on the `` make europe stronger so we can cut nato costs and deal with the pacific '' , true . 
  despite this , there 's one constant in us policy towards europe and its strategic objective : that the eu is n't a complete failure , but it should n't be a complete success either . 
  in other words , that the eu should never be so weak as to be an ineffectual ally , but that the eu should never be so strong as to become a rival . 
  if i have the time , i 'll try translating it and posting it on r/europe , it 's a pretty well researched paper and it 's an interesting and relevant debate . 
  all of that , especially the marshall plan , was n't done out of generosity . 
  the context of the cold war is there . 
  the marshall plan 's objective was to help rebuild europe so the usa could have strong allies against communism , and to stop the spread of communism itself . 
  remember at that point that in quite a few european countries , communism was on the rise , especially in italy and france ( where the communist party was the largest party after the war ) , and communism spreads much faster among a poverty-stricken population . 
  also it had economic benefits to the usa . 
  again , not saying the usa is europe 's evil enemy , just stating that what the usa wants and what europe needs is n't always the same thing . 
  well , the one thing the usa wants is an economically united europe , as it would be a giant , open market for us companies . 
  on the other hand , the one thing the usa does n't want as much is a politically united and strong europe . 
  ( which is why they want the uk to stay / s ) . 
  i agree , though i do n't share your optimism . 
  i find it funny that i 've been called both a racist islamophobe ( for saying that radical islam is a threat and that islam and muslims need some self-inspection ) and a sharia-loving islamoleftist ( for suggesting that all muslims are n't violent rapists ) . 
  investing in science is responsible tax management . 
   i 'm sure you can imagine that if the chinese get to set these standard it will not be in the wests best interest but in theirs as opposed to a deal that will be in the usa 's best interest ? 
  the `` west '' is an empty expression . 
  there 's the usa , and there 's europe . 
  allies , sure , economic partners , of course . 
  but the usa 's interests and europe 's interests are two separate things ( hell , europe itself does n't have a common interest ) . 
  tl ; dr : ttip will benefit europe because some german companies wo n't have to change their plugs . 
  also if you do n't like ttip you support putin and the evil chinese . 
  fair enough about the city . 
  still a high-flying finance guy . 
  he 's a friend of farage , says so himself :  but he also made headlines recently when it emerged he had introduced farage to a millionaire leading donor and had invited the ukip chief to his birthday lunch at a top eaterie in , of all places , brussels . 
  he describes farage as a ` friend ' rather than pinning his political colours to the ukip mast . 
  sure he has plenty of investments in the eu . 
  he also did say ( same article ) that he knew the eu bureaucracy well because he has a house in brussels . 
  france and italy : did n't know we were `` led by a committee of lemmings shepherding shepherding the whole population over a cliff '' . 
  but then that 's traditional french-bashing from british people , so nothing new . 
  also :  `` the uk is really the only dynamic large economy in europe '' might have misread that . 
  still not a very convincing claim , germany would like to object . 
   who is jim mellon ? 
  judging by that daily mail article : - a city boy who bases his business on the isle of man ( wonder why ? ), 
  - looks like a friend of farage - an expert on eu law and politics because `` he has a house in brussels '' - has a special bone to pick against france and italy for some reason - calls himself an economist than goes on to say that the uk is the largest economy in europe honestly looks more like the british trump than the british buffet . 
  jesus , we have pretty bad urban areas , but if the simple existence of crime makes you believe a society is crumbling , you 're going to have a bad time anywhere short of moving to singapore or such . 
  `` we need to protect whistleblowers '' , they said . 
  `` people have a right to know '' , they said . 
  where the actual fuck is a european government asking to `` control what people see on the internet '' ? 
  right to be forgotten laws do n't hand powers to governments , they hand rights to ordinary people who can ask for potentially harmful content to be removed from google .
