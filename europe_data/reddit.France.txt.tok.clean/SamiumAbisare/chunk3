  the government is only enforcing those rights . 
  inb4 the inevitable `` but teh politishuns will hide their evil wrongdoings with deez laws !!!, 
   i have never seen ` france says/does this somewhere in the world ' might be more of a problem with your news reading habits than with french diplomacy , to be honest . 
  i mean , it 's not like french diplomacy was n't instrumental in getting the most ambitious climate treaty since kyoto signed , left its mark on the iran deal , was a driving force for the minsk accords ... 
  the fact that you think france appears aloof in world affairs only shows you do n't pay attention . 
  just looking at military intervention alone ( admittedly only one aspect of world politics ) , there has never been so much interventionnism in a long time . 
  all that diplomatic force , to just end up with `` yeah , whatever the usa says '' , that 's sad . 
  so should my tv be blocked because i go to the toilet during ad breaks ? 
  yes , with noscript or umatrix the blocking is unblocked . 
  i mean , before anything else it was a military campaign between two armies , with atrocities on the side . 
  the most reliable death toll is something like 30 000 republican soldiers , and 170 000 vend\u00e9ens ... but that includes republican vend\u00e9ens slaughtered by the royalists . 
  so no democide , genocide or anycide , just a horrible civil war . 
  atrocities against civilians is nothing new in war . 
  there is no real evidence of a true plan by republicans to exterminate all vend\u00e9en people . 
  also , as i 've said , the royalists also commited atrocities against republican civilians ( such as the slaughter at machecoul ) . 
  a horrifying civil war ? 
  yes . 
  i 'm astounded at the bernie bros on reddit that go as far as to say `` if hillary wins the dem nomination i 'm voting trump '' . 
  they complain hillary 's not left-wing enough , but would vote trump . 
  very few people here think `` if the brits leave we 'll have more power '' . 
  the general feeling in france is that the uk is a hindrance to the eu integration process , and thus should just leave or should never have been allowed in in the first place . 
  there 's also the old gaullist idea that the uk was nothing more than the usa 's bridgehead in europe . 
   inaccurate . 
  first of all , ttip does not affect canada . 
  secondly , what you are saying is nonsense . 
  look at the relevant provisions in ceta . 
  sorry , but is effectively how isds works . 
  foreign companies can ask for ( hefty ) compensation for national policy , which has a `` chilling effect '' on public policy . 
  see veolia suing egypt for 82 million dollars because egypt raised its minimum wage . 
  also see new zealand suspending its policy on neutral cigarette packaging because of the isds suit between philip morris and australia . 
  canada also suspended this after an american tobacco company threatened with an isds suit . 
  since 1994 , european countries have had to pay at least 1.3 billion euros in compensation in isds suits ( 3 billion if you count settlements ) . 
  and that 's a conservative figure . 
  isds is a direct attack on national sovereignty for corporations . 
  of course , german politicians have been saying that there wo n't be anything like that in ttip/ceta , even though there will be isds . 
  well , we wo n't really know , will we , since negotiations are all secret . 
  ( also when i talked ttip i assumed ttip / ceta , but fair enough ) . 
   inaccurate erm , products having to meet low regulatory standards are n't cheaper than those having to meet higher standards ? 
   chlorine chicken is not any less healthy than our chickens fed with pharmaceuticals . 
  chlorine chicken is fine ? 
  yes , that 's what bfr ( german risk institute ) says . 
  the same bfr that never publishes the names of the experts who work on their reports ( bfr also said that monsanto 's roundup herbicide has no cancer risks , despite a who study claiming the opposite ) . 
   but nevertheless , we will see no chlorine chicken in europe . 
  says who exactly ? 
  again , secret negotiations means no accountability . 
   germany has 147 trade deals active , it has n't lowered the workers rights . 
  this is not some trade deal with a cheap labour country , it is a trade deal with the us . 
  the usa does n't recognise the same rights to workers as europe does . 
  not even the basic ones stated in the european social charter . 
  also , such tough competition will lead to massive job losses . 
  ah , but i imagine `` well , you just have to adapt to get better , eh ? '' . 
  well , try telling that to people who 're getting laid off . 
  also , you have n't said anything about `` regulatory cooperation '' . 
  i was . 
  and the usa not being italy does n't change the fact that electing someone because he 's a businessman and therefore knows how to get things done is flawed . 
  i mean , when you ask trump what his policies are going to be and how he 's going to implement them , his basic answer is `` i 'm gon na make a deal , we 'll make the best deals , we 'll win at deals '' . 
  ffs that 's not exactly how it works . 
  us and canadian companies will be able to sue european states if they believe european laws and regulations have harmed their investments . 
  `` regulatory cooperation '' will allow big businesses to co-write laws - hey , no need for lobbyists anymore !, 
  collapse in quality of products as the usa will flood the market with its low-regulation products , while european products ( which have to meet higher sanitation and quality regulations ) prices will skyrocket . 
  american chlorine-cleaned chicken , here we come . 
  a race to the bottom in terms of worker 's rights - this is seen in every single free trade agreement , anywhere . 
  yeah , but it 's also the first time that there 's been a real public admission of torpedoing the whole thing . 
  with good reason , europe has everything to lose and nothing to gain with ttip . 
  a fair bit actually , the basic workings are part of history and geography classes . 
  though a lot of it is remembering which country joined when . 
  in elementary school back in like 1998 or 1999 i remember our teacher inviting some guy to talk about the upcoming change to the euro , what was the whole point of it , etc. 
   some people today consider this war was a `` genocide '' considering some villages were targeted for eradication and the republicans eventually had racist attitudes against the people in that region ( that they 're backwards , savage ... ) . 
  those people are idiots . 
  the royalist vend\u00e9ens slaughtered many innocent republican civilians as well . 
  it was not genocide , but an extremely brutal civil war , one the republicans won . 
  loving the hatred for hillary clinton . 
  `` she 's backed by corporations and rich donors ! '', 
  -  like every single credible us presidency candidate . 
  `` she 's a warmonger !, 
  just look at iraq and libya ! '', 
  -  right . 
  iraq was basically the whole usa and uk brainfarting . 
  libya was , first and foremost , a franco-british fuck-up . 
  finally , look , it 's the usa . 
  they 're * all * warmongers . 
  unless you really think ted `` make the sand glow '' cruz or donald `` bomb isis into the ground and take their oil '' trump are doves . 
  oh yeah , and her disdain for netanyahu and support for the iran deal is well documented . 
  `` she flip-flops / lies / does n't seem genuine / whatevr '' -  it 's politics . 
  get over it . 
  oh yes , the old `` he 's a businessman so he 'll get things done ! '' . 
  italy would like to have a word with you . 
  nah mate , we 're more in the `` who 'll get 0 points first '' race . 
  this seems to be the best tactic , because politicians really have no shame anymore . 
  unless you have some really , really damning stuff , they 'll just carry on . 
  investigative journalists now have to bait them . 
  sad that it 's come to that , but here we are .
