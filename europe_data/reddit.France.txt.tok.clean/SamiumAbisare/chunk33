  well , it 's men who want to live against men who want to die . 
  a show of force wo n't deter them since they 're pretty much ok with dying and going straight to heaven . 
  we 're getting good at this !, 
  sadly . 
  `` brigade de recherche et d'intervention '' , or intervention and search brigade , which is one of the ( many ) intervention/swat-style forces in france . 
  https://twitter.com/franceinfo/status/757863964503965696 apparently , assault was given by the bri and the two men have been killed . 
  ~ ~ looks like no other casualties ~ ~ . 
  update : [ le parisien ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/une-prise-d-otage-en-cours-dans-une-eglise-pres-de-rouen-26-07-2016-5995567.php ) reports that two hostages have been killed as well . 
  update 2 : report from [ l'express ] ( http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/fait-divers/une-prise-en-otage-en-cours-dans-une-eglise-en-seine-maritime_1815907.html?utm_campaign=echobox&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;link_time=1469523961#xtor=cs3-5083 ) , with quotes from a spokesperson of the police union : - the two men were armed with either swords or knives ; - hostages were a priest , two nuns and two churchgoers ; - one of the nuns escaped and alerted the police ; - one of the two men wore a `` prayer hat '' ; - apparently they slit the priest 's throat ( unconfirmed ) update 3 : okay , so about all news sources are confirming that the priest was killed . 
  [ le point ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/en-direct-prise-d-otages-dans-une-eglise-pres-de-rouen-26-07-2016-2057039_23.php ) is reporting that another of the hostages was killed and that a policeman was injured . 
  unconfirmed for the moment . 
  they 're also saying that the two men were bearded and that they screamed `` daesh ! '', 
  when entering the church . 
  also hollande and cazeneuve will very soon be on site and probably give more info . 
  update 4 : according to a spokesperson from the ministry of the interior , just interviewed , the priest is confirmed dead and a second hostage is `` between life and death '' . 
  nothing particular about the uk , all governments are looking to limit , or sometimes ban , e2e encryption . 
  to add weight to this , when the lisbon treaty created the post of `` president of the european union '' , the first idea was to completely replace the revolving presidency system ( by which one country presides by turn ) , and to name a strong , widely recognised , politically important figure ( tony blair was one of the names put forward ) . 
  both were shot down because states did n't want to lose any power . 
  eu regulations are full of cases like this . 
  i always thought putin wants trump to be elected because he feels he would walk all over him . 
  he probably would , too . 
  do n't forget qatar 's investments . 
  another sponsor of islamism . 
  yes , your idea that justice = vengeance is stupid caveman mentality . 
  not my words but yours . 
  and are you seriously comparing singapore , a very wealthy city-state , with larger , much larger countries , with bigger populations and the like ? 
  you can only compare what 's comparable . 
  also , how about checking out these two maps ? 
  [ here 's one for the death penalty around the world . 
  ] ( http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/death_penalty_world_map2_0.jpg ) [ here 's one for homicide rates around the world . 
  ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1730562/original.jpg ) i 'll let you draw your own conclusions . 
  your final paragraph is idiotic . 
  not only is it a deformation of what i wrote , but it 's nothing more than a big strawman . 
  crime rates in france , the uk , germany are much , much lower than in the usa . 
  i 'll also add that the fact that you actually think that the death penalty `` strikes fear into criminals '' shows how delusional you are . 
  i 'll just repeat myself , saying that justice is not vengeance , and leave it at that . 
  you can keep rambling on about `` teh nobility '' , or about how europe is a warzone if you want . 
  aw , sorry , did n't get the joke . 
  i do n't know if its a recent trend on reddit , though , i 've seen the `` republican catalonia vs fascist madrid '' narrative pop up elsewhere , especially in the context of the bar\u00e7a - madrid rivalry . 
  there 's also the fact that orwell 's homage to catalonia is one of the most famous books written about the civil war . 
  but yeah , it 's historically stupid . 
  quick aside but the story of the siege of madrid , while horrifying , is also amazing in the bravery shown by the republicans . 
  love [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/%c2%a1no_pasar%c3%a1n%21_madrid.jpg/800px-%c2%a1no_pasar%c3%a1n%21_madrid.jpg ) image . 
  the death penalty is a barbaric practice that gives the state power of life and death over people . 
  it does not deter criminals , it does n't help the protection of society . 
  it also satisfies a basic , primal need for vengeance . 
  vengeance and justice are two very different things . 
  politics is not always about just doing systematically what the majority wants at any given point . 
  that 's the demagogue 's way . 
  sometimes , once in a blue moon maybe , some politicians actually fight to implement what they truly believe is in the national interest and the general betterment of society , even if its unpopular or not supported by a majority in opinion polls ( and are opinion polls a basis for democracy now ? ) . 
  by the way , the echr has nothing to do with the eu . 
  yes , we can definitely see the region becoming peaceful and stable in the next 10 years . 
  it 's clearly on that path . 
   the invasion created an unforeseen clusterfuck bull-fucking-shit . 
  it was foreseeable , and foreseen . 
  was n't madrid one of the main centres of resistance against franco , though ? 
  you do n't even need any of the recent attacks anywhere for a thread like that . 
  tragedies happen every single day . 
  did n't farage say something like that ? 
  like `` there are huge traffic jams on our roads because there are too many people because immigration ? '', 
  there 's a nice little 2 year window for leaving after art . 
  50 is invoked . 
  the reality is just that the uk is playing for time to try and weasel its way into some kind of deal where they 'll have all the advantages of the eu and none of the obligations . 
  yes , i definitely do . 
  i also believe that governments wo n't do too much though and ultimately private individuals should.take matters in their own hands and reclaim as much privacy as they can . 
  one was caused by the other though . 
  what i 'm really saying is how fast everyone forgot about banks . 
  and the usa is n't protectionist ? 
  you 're delusional . 
  eh , us policy towards the eu is ambivalent . 
  they want the eu to be strong enough to be a reliable ally , but do n't wa n't the eu to be strong enough to become a rival . 
  i 'm still amazed at how fast the narrative shifted from banks causing a gigantic crisis to `` governments are spending too much , austerity is the answer ! '', 
  in such a short span of time . 
  to elaborate , the government used article 49-3 of the constitution , which states that the government can force a bill even if parliament does n't want it . 
  basically what happens is that the vote on the bill is replaced by a vote of no-confidence . 
  if the no-confidence vote fails , the bill is adopted despite not having been directly voted . 
  if the no-confidence vote succeeds , the government is toppled . 
  british people : `` we want to leave !, 
  take back control ! '', 
  eu : `` ok then , leave . '', 
  british people : `` what !, 
  how dare you give us orders ! '', 
  special snowflakeism at its best . 
  yes , because clearly inventive techs need to harvest their clients ' data . 
  who cares for privacy , the digital age is here . 
  did you miss the part where france was one of main driving forces behind the `` right to be forgotten '' regulations , is one of the most aggressive at enforcing it , and sent in police and tax inspectors busting in at google france 's headquarters ? 
  really ? 
  that 's your first reaction ? 
  i always read that the uk was ready to use nuclear weapons as retaliation for prior nuclear attack . 
  i 'll look into it more , i guess !, 
  ( though , to be fair , nuclear doctrines are always pretty hazy - you have to maintain some ambiguity , i guess ) . 
  i thought it was the reptilian overlords ? 
  yeah , they do that here as well as well . 
  i guess it 's a way of telling the new pm or president `` fun 's over , now you 're in charge of the serious stuff '' . 
  we say that heads of state and government have lost a lot of meaningful power , but this is one occasion where we give them the most crushing power mankind has ever known , * and they 're the only ones who can decide to use it * . 
  it 's fascinating , really . 
  the usa , uk , india , pakistan , have , i think , but am apparently wr a no first use policy ( ironically , the official acronym is nofun ) . 
  france ( dissuasion du faible au fort ) and possibly isra\u00ebl ( the samson option ) do n't . 
  not sure about china or russia . 
  edit : apparently the uk does n't have no first use .
