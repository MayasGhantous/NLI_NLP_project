  ** sixty fucking five percent ** ** hey , the_dumbass , you were right , the polls were off . 
  macron . 
  won . 
  ** *** more . 
  [ who you callin ' boring ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/xedkyl04g74 ), 
  the conservative epp has the majority in the eu parliament , the commission is majority epp , most of the heads of state and government are conservative ... 
  yeah but this time we have ze nukes . 
  * now patiently going to wait for the alt-right meltdown and for autistic basement dwellers to make their surrender cucks jokes . 
  i have a big mug ready for their tears . 
  ** yuuuuuuuge **, 
  in appearance . 
  in reality , it 's really just a parliamentary system where the president is more than a figurehead and the prime minister is n't the one deciding the policies but the one carrying them out . 
  however the president ca n't do shit if the parliament is against him . 
  during cohabitation periods , we had left wing presidents with right wing parliament and thus a right wing pm with a right wing policy . 
  for this election the real battle is going to be the legislative election , because the right is going to try and force a cohabitation . 
  so when you get down to the essence , it really just is a parliamentary system . 
  from my point of view , the jedi are evil !, 
  oh yeah , sure , but in the context of that e-mail , they were talking about socialist `` militants '' so it was more in that sense . 
  it can mean both party member and activist depending on the context . 
  more specifically , political party activists . 
  `` militantisme '' means all the actions done by party members in a campaign . 
  i 'm talking about what 's being discussed most prominently . 
  from what i 've seen , there absolutely nothing in those leaks , the only thing is just a big bunch of sad americans with a few desperate fn supporters just spreading doubts with misleading language ( one hilarious one was `` macron has links with militant groups ! '', 
  forgetting that `` militant '' does n't have the same meaning in english and french ) . 
  what a bunch of fucking wankers . 
  edit : some of the `` documents '' are absolutely , 100 % false . 
  such as [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/matthiastwit/status/860621204956303360 ) salary bulletin , with names spelt wrong and letters not of the same size ... 
  that 's a separate issue , the hacking of email accounts of people from en marche . 
  sadly for those , the campaign officially ended and so there 's a ban on any further campaigning until the vote . 
  it 's called a `` plainte contre x '' . 
  it means he 's not sueing one person in particular . 
  oh and weirdly your 4chan based `` reporting '' conveniently forgets the `` documents '' have been photoshopped , have been made using illustrator filters , and even got macron 's signature wrong ... 
  literally no journalist has reported on the `` tax evasion '' . 
  they hace reported on how american right-wingers manufactured a whole fake news about this . 
  and no journalist is being sued . 
  general legal consensus is that constitutions are superior to everything , but treaties are superior to national laws . 
  yeah , i saw that as well . 
  some rumours are saying nkm might be macron 's prime minister . 
  already been debunked . 
  i mean , it was n't even his signature . 
  [ looks much better this way !, 
  ] ( http://tundratabloids.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/hagia-sophia.jpg ), 
  nope . 
  reread my comments . 
  i said `` here '' - france - and in one sentence i said `` france and quite a few european countries '' . 
  the western european countries , mainly , not poland . 
  the meaning of romanisation had evolved as well - it entailed christianity and the acceptance of roman laws , though not latin ( then again latin was n't an `` official language '' ) . 
  they definitely were roman . 
  just the continuation of rome 's evolution . 
  the western empire had just been one part of the roman empire . 
  rome was n't even the capital ( that was constantinople ) and had n't been a centre of power since the 3rd century ( trier , antioch , sirmium , split , had all been capitals ) . 
  again - i was talking about france , not poland . 
  or the uk . 
  sarkozy got hit bad because of his comments on climate change , by the way . 
  and he got battered in his party 's primaries as well , you know . 
  the paris agreement had broad consensus as well . 
  in fact the only people i know of who oppose it here are the far left , who think it does n't go far enough . 
  and i did n't say anything about racism . 
  though blatant racism does n't work too much either , marine le pen worked hard at toning it down . 
  i was talking about france mate . 
  um romanisation was very much a thing . 
  * sigh * i 'm was not discussing the rights and wrongs on specific issues . 
  but pointing out that certain specific stances on those issues would be massively unpopular here , which is why us republicans would lose every election by a landslide against democrats if they were here , which was the whole point of the discussion thread in the first place . 
  i might also remind you that i have no orders to take from you , and that insult is just poor form . 
   you keep repeating that random line based on your feelings , but you fail to substantiate or even answer what i asked . 
  it 's not a random line based on my feelings ( whatever that means ) , just pointing out a difference in political culture . 
  there are polls about these issues as well , all point to what i 'm saying . 
   funnily , you cite anti-science positions . 
  based on modern medical understanding , a statement that unborn babies are n't human would be anti-science . 
  that 's irrelevant to the fact that mainstream us conservatism would be considered very extreme in france ...   does the same extend for any muslim not keeping their religion secret ? 
  a few years ago , a far-left candidate of the npa party presented herself with a veil . 
  it caused a big controversy , it rocked the npa and they lost massive amounts of credibility . 
  we have a very strong dislike to openly religious candidates , as is evident to anyone familiar with our politics and political culture . 
  no , i said that any politician who would seriously propose banning abortion here would be laughed at and ridiculed . 
  the assisted suicide part being what is commonly referred to as `` exagerrating for emphasis '' . 
  as would any creationist , climate change denialist , \u00fcber-christian ( fillon just said that he was christian once and he got flak for it , as well as for christian groups who support him , for instance ) , anti-universal healthcare , etc. 
  the whole thing , again , as part of a discussion why democrats would be way more popular than republicans here . 
  this ... is n't a debate on abortion . 
  we were discussing how/why democrats would always be more massively popular than republicans in france and in quite a few european countries , and why they 'd systematically win elections if us politicians were suddenly transplanted here - because of issues such as secularism , abortion , climate change , social policy , etc. 
  ( oh , and you 're perfectly allowed to have those positions as a politician here . 
  just that nobody will ever take you seriously ) . 
  it 's not my fascist side , rather your inability to understand that everywhere is n't the usa and the most moderate of american conservatives would be seen as a lunatic here . 
  abortion is n't in debate here . 
  there 's a wide consensus over it . 
  the only prominent politician against it is marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen and even she tries to never mention it . 
  it would n't change a thing . 
  the first candidate that would come around saying `` universal healthcare is dangerous communism '' and that `` jesus guides my every step '' or `` climate change do n't real '' or `` abortion is murder !!, 
  we should ban it !! '', 
  would be laughed at and ridiculed right into an assisted suicide . 
  shy fn factor has been very properly identified by pollsters since 2002 . 
  it has n't appeared in any election since . 
  secondly , any people who had doubts about credibility saw le pen 's absolute debacle at the debate yesterday . 
  polls suggest 60-40 and they 've been spot on this time around - and when they did n't predict the exact score ( such as the primaries ) they caught on all the tendencies . 
  literally any democrat would get 80 or 90 % of the vote against literally any republican . 
  that 's weird though , i did n't see any of those past 2005 . 
  it still barely registers . 
  french people abroad will still use french media for the elections . 
  also , sociologically , culturally , etc. 
  most french people abroad are viciously anti-fn .
