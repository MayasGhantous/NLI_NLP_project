  so yeah , it wo n't make a dent . 
  lies , such as ? 
  clearly , the deciding issue of the election . 
  if you 've missed the debate , you can also rewatch it [ here . 
  yes . 
  in first round debates you can be all fire and brimstone if you want , but in the second round people are watching if you can actually lead . 
  were you in france last in 2003 ? 
  that stopped a long ago !, 
  well , that might happen if macron does fail . 
  on the other hand , it does n't surprise me one bit that pseudo - `` patriots '' are hoping for the country to go worse for their own gain . 
  they 're two separate elections . 
  one is a presidential election , and the second one is a parliamentary one , that 's going to happen in june . 
  lots of things may happen . 
  this was supposed to be a boulevard for marine le pen : failed socialist presidency , rising anger over the eu and globalisation , islamist threat ... and not only did she fail to deliver on the first round ( fn insiders were counting on a 25 to 30 % score , they got 21 % ) but she had the worst debate performance in ... well , in the history of debates . 
  if they do n't win about 50 seats in the legislative elections , then she 'll be fighting an internal rebellion and possibly a party civil war . 
  he said that he always respected her voters but not her party . 
  ignoring the weirdness that had just happened . 
   in this gif , le pen is making fun of macron by mocking him . 
  in one of his speeches , he had spoken badly about front national supporters , whom he sees as cowards and haters ( i 'm painting in broad strokes here ) . 
  actually that 's not true at all . 
  he has said that of the front national but not of its voters , repeatedly saying that fn cynically uses the despair of people . 
  she was trying to imply macron hates her voters and tried imitating him a bit poorly , saying `` this is what you said , they 're theeeeeeere , in the countrysiiiiiiide , on social meeeeeedia ... '' . 
  i think on the video you can even tell for a split second macron 's thinking `` wtf is she on ? '', 
  we have a very large number of mps , 577 in the national assembly and 348 in the senate . 
  not only does it cost a lot , but because there are so many , each individually does n't have enough means to have a proper staff and all . 
  lots of parliamentary aides and assistants complain about this , especially compared to other democracies where an mp can do much more work . 
  well , that was fun . 
  le pen was quite simply blasted away , and really lost her nerves at the end . 
  [ this . 
  just ... this .

  but there 's already [ `` dumb british blonde fucks 15 million people at once '' ] ( https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph576ed7b77d140 ) on pornhub ... 
  one day i 'll do a whole tale of this campaign since the beginning , to show how mind-numbingly crazy it was . 
  dat username tho, 
  macron had a similar one against philippot : `` i love france , but you love france 's decline because that 's what makes you exist '' . 
  foiled by 4 months !,

  but remember , according to m\u00e9lenchon voters , le pen and macron are literally the same . 
  from what i gather a few of them do n't really care and most are rationalising it as `` she wo n't * really * do it , you know '' . 
  for real , i worked in politics here in a minister 's team , we set up an interview with faz . 
  i was blown by the quality of the questions . 
  those journos knew their stuff . 
  i wish they did an english-language edition . 
  well , i get where you 're coming from but i just want to adress the  and second - abandon this bullshit once and for good and stay as an economic union . 
  because i do n't think that can work , here 's why i do n't think so . 
  so let 's imagine we 're just an economic union , no political institutions at all , matters are all settled between member states . 
  i think we 'd all agree to keep the single market though , not just a big-ass free-trade agreement . 
  so let 's imagine this meeting between heads of government . 
  `` hey guys , there 're these sweet self-driving smart cars coming in , it 's gon na be a huge boost to all of our car industries !, 
  you know what we should do ? '', 
  `` we should agree on a common set of rules and regulations , that way we 'll be able to trade 'em even more easily between us !, 
  and we 'll make those rules environment-friendly and shit , win-win ! '', 
  also since we 're such a big market it 'll force manufacturers all around the world to adapt to those !, 
  win-win-win ! '', 
  `` alright guys , let 's get to work ! '', 
  * some time later ... * `` jesus fuck this is complicated shit . '', 
  `` i know , i 'm discovering some legislation i did n't even know i had !, 
  this is way too complex for us to handle at this level ! '', 
  `` for real , i got other shit to handle , and our monthly meetings wo n't be enough to do proper work ... '' `` you know what we should do ? '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  `` appoint guys from all over europe who 'll work this and look into it and then we just vote it in our own countries . 
  and we all agree to respect the common rules ! '', 
  `` good idea , let 's do that ! '', 
  * more time passes ... * `` okay , our commission has given us this neat set of common rules for self-driving smart cars ... they seem okay to me , everyone agree ? '', 
  `` yup ! '', 
  `` then let 's implement this shit '' * even more time passes * `` so , we all voted the self-driving smart car laws in our national parliaments , everything going well for everyone ? 
  `` yup '' `` yup '' `` nope , not me ! '', 
  '' * sigh * what is it , netherlands ? '', 
  `` one of my companies tried selling cars in italy , turns out they could n't because of some bullshit rule they inserted about every self-driving smart-car must have a panettone distributor in the rear seat , that 's fucking bullshit . '', 
  `` what the fuck , italy ? '', 
  `` ma che '' '' * sigh * okay , clearly , we 're gon na need oversight , how should we do it ? 
  ourselves ? '', 
  `` nah fam , i like you guys but i do n't trust you 100 % to not screw me behind my back ... '' `` so how about these guys we appointed to make the law ? 
  why do n't they oversee us ? '', 
  '' yeah they could but they ca n't condemn us , they 're just a bunch of guys . 
  we need judges and shit . '', 
  '' * sigh * fine , let 's set up a court as well ... '' * even more time passes ... * `` well , i 'd say our self-driving smart cars initiative is a smashing success . '', 
  `` yeah !, 
  we 're awesome ! '', 
  `` um ... oui ... but i have a problem ... '' '' * sigh * what is it again ? '', 
  `` well , we just gave a bunch of guys the power to write a law and then to oversee that we do n't fuck around , plus a court they can go to if we do . 
  the thing is , who watches the watchers ? 
  we need some democratic oversight too ... '' `` well , i mean we 're elected , too ... '' `` yeah but come on , we ca n't oversee the people who oversee us , that 's bullshit ! '', 
  `` is not problem in hungary ... '' '' * facepalm * anyway , what should we do ? '', 
  `` well , a separate group of people who can control as well as review the rules we want ... '' `` oh fuck , you 're not suggesting we have a european parliament as well ? '', 
  `` well , yeah , and i 'm even suggesting we should have it elected by the people ... '' * some time after that * daily mail headline : * gay refugee eu bureaucrats want to control our british smart cars to give us cancer !, 
  ban this sick filth !, 
  * `` this is bullshit guys . 
  why do n't we just be an economic union ? '', 
  well not every national government has a `` every minister should be elected '' rule . 
  also think that of we only had epp commissioners , we 'd have missed out on vestager !, 
  it is the case since the lisbon treaty . 
  the president of the commission must be from the majority in the eu parliament . 
  last european elections , we had a clear choice - either schulz in case of a esp majority , juncker in case of an epp majority . 
  some countries - especially one that keeps moaning about lack of democracy in the eu - thought `` nah fuck that '' and opposed juncker 's democratic victory . 
  funny because it 's nearly true . 
  1st may was chosen as international worker 's day in memory of the haymarket protests in chicago in favour of an 8-hour working day . 
  you mean , like it already is , despite british objections ? 
  hilarious comments here from british posters talking about cameron . 
  did it not occur to you that when he says `` reform '' he does n't mean `` more opt-outs and cherry picking '' like cameron did , but `` more integration '' ?
