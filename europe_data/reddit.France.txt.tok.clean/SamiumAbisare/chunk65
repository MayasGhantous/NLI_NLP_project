  which is why his programme includes closing down any religious association or any place of worship that spreads extremist ideas ... 
  le monde did a pretty good job of taking every candidate 's official platform as well as what they said during interviews - [ here 's ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/personnalite/emmanuel-macron/programme/ ) the full programme ( in french though ) . 
  oh yeah , sorry , i missed that part of your post . 
  true . 
  contrary to the t_d army spewing bullshit , here 's his proposals on immigration : * integration as an absolute priority for any people applying for legal immigration , with emphasis on language and values ( secularism and women 's rights in particular ) . 
  * simplifying and favorising highly-skilled immigration and `` talents from across the world '' * taking in refugees but with strict criteria and especially allowing for a better and speedier deportation for people who do n't meet that criteria ( with an objective of having an average time of 8 weeks for applications to be processed ) . 
  * reinforcing europe 's border protection , with an objective of having a force of 5 000 mobilisable people working in a new european border protection agency . 
  * creating checkpoints in migrant departure hotspots outside the eu , acting against smugglers and effective deportation of migrants unauthorised to enter the eu .

  paris has never been a favourable ground for the fn . 
  it 's a pretty left-leaning city , though it has extremely solid right-wing strongholds ( in the rich paris west ) . 
  edit : just checked the official [ results in paris ] ( http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/011/075/index.html ) . 
  as you can see , macron is topping nearly all the * arrondissements * ( city districts ) except the very right-wing ones ( 16th , 17th ) and the very left-wing ones ( 18th , 19th , 20th ) . 
  they make an important segment of the political right though not a majority one . 
  compared to society in general catholic conservatives are a small minority . 
  fillon played up his christian beliefs a bit during the primaries but then shut up about them . 
  and i 'm assuming his admission that there would be members of sens commun ( conservative christian movement who support fillon ) in his government hurt him . 
  for example alain jupp\u00e9 said he could n't support a government with sens commun in it . 
  yeah , i was really talking about her inner circle . 
  well , we should . 
  we do n't care about their private lives . 
  a lot of that is taken out of context but he does have a violent hatred for german conservatives . 
  his fiery patriotism is n't too out of place here though . 
  it 's never happened and there 's no rule for it , but there is one in case a candidate dies before the first round : the election has to be delayed . 
  in the case of a 2nd round candidate dying there 's no rule at all , i believe the constitutional council would call the election null and void and we 'd have to restart everything again , from the first round . 
  nowhere near enough to be a serious contender for the second round . 
  the most conservative polls have macron doing 60 % ... 
  given those people 's respect and tolerance and the way their internal security acts , not the best idea !, 
  well , as we 've just seen , a lot can happen in 5 years . 
  a year and so ago , everybody was convinced of a jupp\u00e9 presidency or even sarkozy comeback . 
  not too hard . 
  `` cucks '' `` brainwashed by the mainstream ( ( ( media ) ) ) '' `` the french surrender again '', 
  le pen supporters on suicide watch . 
  inside the fn , they 're extremely disappointed at their score , they really hoped they 'd touch 30 % . 
  their campaign was really bad though . 
  sorry , t_d and all other alt-righters but `` the buck stops here '' . 
  no , haha , student days are over now , but most of my friends are pretty left-wing ( to be fair i sexually identify as social-democrat , but could n't vote for hamon ) . 
  honestly m\u00e9lenchon has done a pretty great job of modernising the `` radical '' left , in terms of ideas as well as in their pr and electoral communications . 
  by comparison die linke seems still a bit ... archaic ? 
  far cry from 2009 when m\u00e9lenchon launched his movement and said that die linke was his model ... 
  i 'm putting absolutely 0 faith in this one . 
  alright , heading over to see the election night with ( mostly ) fanatic m\u00e9lenchon supporting friends . 
  getting ready to drink their tears ( and nationalist tears from the internet too ! ) . 
  long live open and progressive societies , long live free trade , long live europe , long live the republic !, 
  hoping for our german bros to elect schulz too - a macron / schulz duo would be great for the eu . 
  well , it is true , mate . 
  closer actually had pics of them holding hands and wanted to publish them under the headline * `` moment de tendresse ... '' * but were convinced not to by sarkozy 's entourage . 
  source : worked in politics and public/media relations , it 's one of those things that `` everyone knows '' . 
  just like fillon 's affair with one of his aides , or his big gay parties . 
  not yet , i think . 
  every number is to be be taken with massive amounts of salt at this stage . 
  apparently , lower turnout in [ key right-wing d\u00e9partements ] ( https://twitter.com/mathieugallard/status/856170328006983680 ) as well as in [ fillon 's constituency ] ( https://twitter.com/mathieugallard/status/856163363113635846 ) . 
  also , apparently , for traditionally left-wing strongholds , [ turnout is just a bit lower ] ( https://twitter.com/mathieugallard/status/856179696668639232 ) . 
  interesting to see that paris has apparently increased . 
  macron and melenchon would probably benefit the most , imo . 
  ( again , grain of salt etc. ), 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=mathieu+gallet&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewivzqay-rrtahxd2rokhwhzaasq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1764&amp;bih=955 ) is your ( alleged ) competition . 
  hope you measure up . 
  there 's an incredible tendency to do that . 
  on here and some other forums , i read posts about people moaning about multi-culturalism and affirmative action and such . 
  meanwhile there 's no law for affirmative action here ... 
  they just assume everywhere is like america . 
  ( on the flip side some us and uk progressive friends were absolutely baffled that , by and large , a majority of the left in france supports laws banning face veils and such ) . 
  `` but tehy said taht trump n brexit wont be hapening so that mean le pen will win '',

  in paris , 5th arrondissement . 
  if you went an hour ago , i 'm not surprised , most people are eating at 13h30, 
  also there 's a symbolic element to it , too . 
  * tons of people in my voting station . 
  i 'd say turnout is going to be higher than people thought . 
  now for the anxious wait , and checking on belgian and swiss news websites , giving them their usual every-5-year audience boost !, 
  oh , it 's customary to end a speech here with `` long live the republic !, 
  long live france ! '' . 
  in fact it 's pretty odd when it does n't happen ( only the trotskyist candidates do n't say it ) . 
  he was pretty old by then , and there was n't much he could do , especially given the empire was pretty exhausted by war against the sassanids . 
  also heraclius is also the one who pwned the persians hard . 
  he took a massive gamble and rode his last army straight into persia , wrecked their armies one after the other , beat them at nineveh not far from the capital of ctesiphon , caused them to sue for peace in which they returned syria and egypt to the romans . 
  if he had died younger , he would undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest roman leaders . 
  there is no proof to the contrary . 
  just sayin ' ... 
  though if it were antonina after all , i 'd be fine , if procopius is to be believed ... 
  and in the time of justinian the empire included all of greece , macedonia , the balkans , and italy after the gothic wars ... 
   spoke latin then greek  their legal codes are the basis for most european legal systems  created the cyrillic alphabet  were massively influential on russia and balkan states  greek orthodoxy  stopped islam from spreading into europe  kept and transmitted the great philosophical works of antiquity , as well as mathematics and engineering  spurred the renaissance  `` not european '', 
  justinian 's relentless pursuit of the reconquest of the west was , in hindsight , an error , especialmy as it overstretched the empire . 
  then his successors had terrible financial problems . 
  the bulgar slayer was quite possibly the greatest eastern roman emperor . 
  haha , i heard about them , think i 'll read them over the summer , they seem absurdly fun . 
  true . 
  but tradition generally says it 's belisarius , so eh . 
  also , the [ opposite mosaic ] ( https://www.awesomestories.com/images/user/15ad757ba2.jpg ) shows theodora and the lady to her left is said to be antonina , belisarius ' wife . 
  a close observation lets us infer that antonina had pretty big tits . 
  man , where to begin with this guy ? 
  * beat the persians at the [ battle of dara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_dara ) despite being hopelessly outnumbered * ruthlessly crushed the [ nika revolt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nika_riots ) , killing 30 000 guys like a stone-cold muthafucka * [ * retook roman africa from the vandals with only 15 000 men !, 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vandalic_war ) * started a campaign to re-take italy from the goths , with the impressive [ defense of rome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_rome_ ( 537 % e2 % 80 % 9338 ) ) where he held out with 5 000 men against 50 000 !, 
  * tricked the goths into handing him ravenna ( they proposed that he betray justinian and become western emperor , he feigned acceptance , entered ravenna in triumph then took the city and was all like `` xaxaxa germans i trick yuo '' . 
  problem was , justinian started having doubts about him because of this ... ) . 
  * repelled a bulgar invasion for one last hurrah . 
  sadly his officers did n't respect him because he was a complete cuckold , his wife antonina was by all definitions , a slut . 
  she possibly cheated on him with his adopted son , too !,
