  he said he would privatise social security . 
  then did a u-turn . 
  other countries can work how they want . 
  i 'd rather not have a high level of working poors or going on the path of liberalism . 
  we need reform , fillon just wants to destroy . 
  so you 're saying she is silencing dissenting opinions . 
  the guy wants catholic extremists in government . 
  he wants to dismantle the state and social security . 
  he wants no legal limit on working hours . 
  he 's as dangerous as le pen , just in different ways . 
  eu-wise ? 
  he has no positive vision ( which macron has , one of the few things i give him credit for ) , it 's going to be more of the same . 
  eh , actually i think he 'll win it . 
  really ? 
  he 's kind of a national joke , though he has disproportionate influence with certain political figures ( sarkozy and manuel valls in particular ) . 
  it 's a common warning for high school students studying for the philosophy exam to never ever quote him . 
  the labour party 's suicide since 2009 is astonishing . 
  sure it 's hard to rebuild after 12 years in power ( hell , it tool the conservatives a long time to rebuild after the thatcher/major years ) , but it 's only been a total trainwreck and with corbyn they 've voted themselves into irrelevance . 
  they 'll be teaching this stuff in political science classes for years . 
  wait , people think judo is girly ? 
  i pity the fool who ever calls teddy riner `` girly '' . 
  that 's no moon !, 
  no , but you did start the war that wrecked the middle-east so bad it caused the rise of isis and of terrorist attacks we suffer from today . 
  contrary to americans , we do n't live in the 1940s anymore . 
  this must be that american education they talk about . 
  `` government '' has a different meaning in france and in the us . 
  in the us it means the whole political and administrative apparatus , while in france it means `` the group who happens to be in power '' , or more specifically , the ministers and the prime minister . 
  there are basically two positions . 
  `` nato ? 
  it 's alright i guess ? '', 
  `` nato is filthy american imperialism !!!!, 
  as a culture , we have a very strong underlying belief that everything is a zero-sum game - if someone wins that means somebody else is losing . 
  leads to a general lack of trust everywhere . 
  that was then . 
  this is now . 
  there 's no contradiction in saying `` thanks for that , but we do n't trust you now '' . 
  obviously , leaving the failing and undemocratic european union for the glorious and prosperous alba , with such economic powerhouses as nicaragua , ecuador and bolivia , and the democratic values promoted by cuba and venezuela makes ** perfect ** sense . 
  right after doing away with part our nuclear defense capabilities and his big international conference to negotiate eastern europe away to russia , of course . 
  right , the irak war happened because of the fall of the ottomans . 
  the usa has never been anyone 's friend . 
  countries do n't have friends . 
  and the usa certainly is n't a friend to france . 
  actually a pretty good actress , was amazing in la ciocciara . 
  all of them stupid , like the people who supported that war . 
  jesus , mads mikkelsen is so unbelievably hot . 
  somehow his face is elegant and refined , and at the same time rough and primal and savage ( which is why he makes a great hannibal ) . 
  true . 
  i had such a massive crush on her and those eyes !, 
  i can see this one being a massive let-down , and 2017 's john carter . 
  [ an even better one . 
  i was just looking up the origins of each day 's name in french and english . 
  i was trying to find out about other european languages , but kinda hard to find . 
  here goes for french : * lundi = lune-di = moon day * mardi = mars-di = day of mars * mercredi = mercure-di = mercury 's day * jeudi = jovis dies = jupiter 's day * vendredi = venera-di = venus ' day * samedi = shabbat day * dimanche = dies dominicus = day of the lord and for english : * monday = moon day * tuesday = tiw 's ( tyr 's ) day * wednesday = woden ( odin ) 's day * thursday = thor 's day * friday = frige ( freya ) 's day * saturday = saturn 's day * sunday = literally sun 's day interesting blend of pagan and christian names . 
  also funny that in both languages friday is linked with love goddesses ... 
  so what about other european languages ? 
  ( also sorry if it 's been done before ), 
  * northern france ( pas-de-calais , etc. 
  ) : alcoholics , unemployed , white trash , incestuous and inbred , pedophiles * britanny : stubborn , way too proud of their regional identity , apparently very religious , rains all the time . 
  also , pig-fuckers * paris : snobby , crass , arrogant , `` cosmopolitan elites '' * alsace : bloody ultra-conservative germans who think they 're better than the rest of us , but come running back crying when they do re-join the german fatherland * marseille : basically gta * corsica : hot women , but do n't look at them if you do n't want to get your throat slit , mafia , terrorists * south-west : rugby loving boorish people with funny accents * south-east : either filthy or rich , racists with funny accents * burgundy and franche-comt\u00e9 : medieval peasants * lyon : paris wannabes , also cosmopolitan elites * seine-saint-denis ( suburb in the north of paris ) : basically syria * normandy : indecisive * overseas departments and regions : who cares + thanks for the footballers guys, 
  the north , i like having a job and not fucking my sister . 
  the two-headed eagle is a heritage from the byzantine empire , if i 'm not mistaken the two heads mean the empire reigns over europe and asia . 
  a woman also sued him because according to her he forced her to give him a blowjob while he had a revolver pointed at her head . 
  his wife came to his defense saying `` my husband does n't need a revolver if he wants a blowjob ! '', 
  dat byzantine eagle, 
  on top of his scandals , i 'm betting that he lost some votes because of his ties to certain , uh , fundamentalist christian groups . 
  is n't `` india '' a girl 's name as well ? 
  `` tahar luz au psg '' `` pete assenmank \u00e0 l'om '' `` nick tamer \u00e0 lyon '' a more civilised meme , from a more elegant age . 
  not at all , but we will ruthlessly make fun of bad french accents in english . 
  [ unless you 're jacques chirac ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=304uhize01c ) and therefore the epitome of cool . 
  that 's more of a cultural thing , people still have an obsession with antibiotics even if doctors tell them they do n't beed them . 
  there are still tons of government campaigns to persuade people , the most famous one is `` antibiotic is not automatic '' . 
  * once upon a time in france * , a series about joseph joanovici , a jewish romanian immigrant who becomes filthy rich , then during wwii is close to the gestapo and funds the resistance . 
  amazingly , based on a true story . 
  probably very unhappy . 
  we 're among the big antidepressants consumers , opinion polls show we 're more pessimistic about our future than iraqis or afghans , and we just like to complain all the time . 
  pssst , kids ... wan na get [ some ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_revolutionary_wars ) [ republicanism ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_french_client_states#sister_republics ), 
  * [ vive henri iv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=298cdann2q8 ) ( long live henri iv ) , probably the closest thing the house of bourbon had as an official song , often the rallying song for monarchists . 
  here in a really beautiful version by tchaikovsky . 
  * [ la carmagnole ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6dav5kb9cy ) : a song from the french revolution composed after the fall of the monarchy . 
  it basically says how louis xvi and marie-antoinette tried to screw the people but got fucked by cannonfire . 
  the chorus goes `` let 's dance the carmagnole , long live the sound of cannons ! '', 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35unktdpho0 ) ( ah !, 
  another revolutionary song , with a very famous chorus , `` ah !, 
  it 'll be fine , it 'll be fine , it 'll fine , all aristocrats to the lamp-posts , ah !, 
  * [ le chant du d\u00e9part ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gc_152tuqo ) ( song of the departure ) , another revolutionary song that was basically the anthem under napoleon . 
  * [ la victoire est \u00e0 nous ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75rupdkyqp0 ) ( victory is ours ) , another napoleonic song . 
  * [ le r\u00e9giment de sambre et meuse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvkvbvxkfdy ) ( the sambre and meuse regiment ) : just a military march * [ la strasbourgeoise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pthl8athv_a ) ( the girl from strasbourg ) : a pretty sad song about a girl from strasbourg who becomes orphaned after the franco-prussian war . 
  * [ vous n'aurez pas l'alsace et la lorraine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3a4kol4yo ) ( you will never have alsace and lorraine ) : a `` revanchist '' song about the loss of alsace and lorraine in 1871 , the defiance of the local population . 
  * [ on ne passe pas !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bfgygzslbo ) ( you shall not pass ! ), 
  : military song about the [ battle of verdun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_verdun ) . 
  really my favourite . 
  * `` this is the gate of france , and you shall never pass ... '' * . 
  * [ le chant des partisans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suzwlf_vukg ) ( song of the partisans ) : the song of the french resistance during wwii . 
  oh yeah and [ la marseillaise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axvvwq8yszq ) obviously , my favourite version , by berlioz . 
  back when i was playing oblivion , i looked for a neat name for my character , after some search i found these two sumerian kings , `` samium '' and `` abisare '' , thought it sounded nice , and i 've stuck with it ever since . 
  okay , because populists , instead of actually looking at what policies the eu implemented and the reason why they were implemented , as well as the alternatives , only see that : - there was a bail out for financial institutions - after that there was austerity therefore the eu works only for banks and financial institutions . 
  i have had people tell me `` why does n't the ecb help states ? 
  it only helps banks ! '',
