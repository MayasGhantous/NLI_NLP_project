  in spite of , you know , [ facts ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/debt-crisis-mario-draghi ) . 
  because populism . 
  we have [ baron noir ] ( http://www.monteursassocies.com/wp-content/uploads/baron_noir_affiche.jpg ) which is about a politician from dunkirk and his machinations . 
  in general it 's made to be extremely realistic and inspired by real events . 
  season 1 had tons of inspiration from hollande 's election , there 's a season 2 coming , as well . 
  marseille is so bad it 's good . 
  nothing new actually , i do n't understand people who are disappointed . 
  it 's standard us policy , obama was the exception . 
  [ ` muricans gon na ` murica ] ( https://youtu.be/xmrmtvogbpk ), 
  he does tend to be overrated a bit , and has a tendency to just disappear in big games , which is why so many people call him a flat-track bully . 
  i 'm fairly certain europeans are way more into bdsm than anywhere else . 
  `` fuck '' - the really hot one . 
  so italy . 
  `` marry '' - the good stable one . 
  so germany . 
  `` kill '' - ca n't say the uk since that would include our scot bros. 
  i 'll just say portugal because of euro 2016 salt . 
  when i went to the us , it happened pretty often . 
  i had to repress the urge to tell them `` do we know each other ? '', 
  and `` mind your own business '' . 
  we 're waiting in a line , not hanging out in a caf\u00e9 ... 
  from our constitution :  any man persecuted in virtue of his actions in favour of liberty may claim the right of asylum upon the territories of the republic . 
  so yes . 
  ... i am , actually ... 
  also tolkien 's inspiration for the tale of the children of hurin !, 
  well , technically , king arthur as well . 
  however there 's also count roland , a paladin in charlemagne 's court . 
  the song of roland is the first real french literature and it 's an epic poem about how roland fights alone against like a million saracens by himself somewhere in the pyrenees , blowing his war-horn to warn charlemagne ( yes , this is where boromir comes from ) . 
  it 's semi-mythical because even if we do know that there was a roland ( more accurately hrolandt ) , he probably died in an ambush by basque mountain-dwellers and that 's about it . 
  another foundation myth is that the kings of france descend from the trojans . 
  the legend goes that francion , prince of troy , escaped the sack of the city with aeneus ( who according to virgil then sort of was at the origin of rome ) and established his kingdom beyond the rhine . 
  thus creating the frankish realm . 
  they say that charlemagne 's sword was actually the sword of hector of troy as well . 
  yeah , the makeup that looks like there 's no makeup is pretty big . 
   very common , but much more common to see young women here in barcelona wearing little or no make up at all than it is in the uk , where i think it 's more culturally `` required '' . 
   what he 's saying is that spanish women are so pretty they do n't need makeup . 
  the ascent of supreme warlord macron . 
  i voted macron in both rounds . 
  obviously , i 'm very happy , and hopeful . 
  * regarding european affairs , i hope macron will be able to bring in his enthusiastic and ambitious ideas for europe , and bring a closer relationship to all our european neighbours . 
  * more than that , i hope he 'll do what hollande did n't and actually stand for something . 
  hollande just seemed ... absent on the european stage . 
  that the french president was nearly silent for the refugee crisis is mindblowing . 
  europe is built on the franco-german axis and if that 's out of balance , it does n't work as well . 
  * regarding interior affairs , i voted for him because he wants to reform a lot of our existing system to make it work better and in a modernised way . 
  whereas the right wing just wants to destroy the whole thing - fillon 's programme was one of the most regressive ever and if i 'm honest i was more scared of him than of le pen . 
  some of his key reforms , such as a comprehensive overhaul of the unemployments benefits system , a transition of funding social security through `` normal '' taxes instead of payroll taxes are the ones i 'm looking out for . 
  * finally , he does seem to want to sweep up all of french politics . 
  already he 's stated his government would n't be only career politicians . 
  and the rules he set up for the selection of candidates in legislative elections will be a big shake-up : 50 % of `` new '' people who are n't politicians , 50 % of women . 
  plus proposals on eliminating corruption , and limiting the number of mandates a politician can have . 
  it 's going to shake up all our tired political establishment , made up of people who were in national office since way before i was born . 
  so yes , i 'm hopeful . 
  i was n't in 2012 , because having followed socialist politics for a long time , i knew ( like a lot of others ) that hollande would be a failure . 
  but this is the other thing - this is the last shot we have . 
  if macron fucks up then there * will * be an fn presidency in 5 years . 
  that 's my feeling right now . 
  hopeful , but really , manu , * do n't fuck this up * . 
  really ? 
  i thought it was in the `` so bad it 's good '' category ... 
  ... fuck i forgot a lot of them . 
  though with d\u00e9sir\u00e9 , innocent and fortun\u00e9 you went full colonialism there !, 
  apologies , i did n't see . 
  ~ ~ do n't all names mean something , just that we 've forgotten the etymology ? ~ ~ did n't see ops edit !, 
  pierre ( stone ) is the most common one i can think of , there are much rarer names as well like victoire ( victory ) , fleur ( flower ) , ange ( angel ) , auguste ( august ) , florentin ( florentine ) ... 
  i 'm bored at my office , can you at least let me pretend i 'm 16 again ? 
  there are a few here and there . 
  filthy iphone normies are still pretty common but still a majority of people are in the android master race . 
  first time i had any alcohol it was probably at 9 or 10 , trying out wine at the family lunch . 
  first time real drinking probably at 14 . 
  first time really drunk at 16 . 
  one thing we should remember in terms of how republicans work is the disconnect between public image and reality of practice . 
  if the republicans * really * acted as idiotic as they look , the world should have collapsed into world war iii in dubya 's time . 
  but in reality , republicans , are also playing a political game like the others ( even though from my point of view , even the most moderate republican is a crazed theocrat ) . 
  so yeah , they do n't compare to the nazis , stalinists , or even some of the anarchists . 
  i 'd also point out to op that the medieval church was n't damaging to europe , at all . 
  it is a swear word so not to be used in front of everyone . 
  otherwise , it 's very adaptable , and works everywhere . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/51f1lx/french_exclamations_a_beginners_guide/ ) technically `` putain '' means `` whore '' , so sometimes you 'll see it as a noun ( * une putain * ) which is a sort of elegantly trashy way of saying whore . 
  merde is for everyday use . 
  then you have * bordel de merde * or * putain de merde * . 
  then you have * putain de bordel de merde * . 
  then it 's time to get creative . 
  the `` blasphemous '' stuff like * nom de dieu !, 
  bon sang !, 
  * are incredibly tame , so much so that nobody 'd use the except in irony . 
  in any case , * putain * , * bordel * and * merde * have got you covered for every need . 
  the mockery part is one of the biggest cultural differences there is and is incredibly misunderstood . 
  i do n't think any of my foreign friends ever found pierre desproges funny , most french people find him hysterical . 
  even les inconnus has a bit of that vicious form of humour . 
  to say nothing of les guignols de l'info which mixed our love of politics with this form of humour . 
  americans especially do n't get it at all , i feel , many of those i know feel it 's mean-spirited . 
  then again , we do n't really get their humour either ... i ca n't think of a single american comedy that made me laugh , weirdly . 
  but we love english humour !, 
  the other thing people do n't know is the most ruthless target of mockery is ourselves but only when there are no foreigners around . 
  i 'll also add a specific type that revolves around playing around with the language and being creative with it , slang and such . 
  kaamelott has a lot of this . 
  it 's already a sort of macron - m\u00e9lenchon war though . 
  now that fillon 's dead , there 's no longer a common enemy everyone hates . 
  yeah .
