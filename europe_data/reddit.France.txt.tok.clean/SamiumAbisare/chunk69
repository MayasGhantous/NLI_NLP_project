  * 9/11 as most western countries * 21 april 2002 - jospin eliminated at the first round , and a le pen in the second round * 2005 - we reject the european constitution treaty - also a massive wave of violence in the * banlieues * that leads to a very short state of emergency * 2015 - charlie hebdo and november 13th, 
  yes , but this is where political realities come hand in hand with constitutions . 
  it 's extremely risky to dissolve the national assembly , and can backfire quite heavily . 
  case in point : chirac dissolving the national assembly in 1997 , where he thought it would give his presidency a new boost ( despite him already having a majority ! ), 
  and it backfired horribly , giving the majority to a socialist-green-communist coalition ( the `` plural left '' ) , with lionel jospin as prime minister . 
  so everybody 's extremely wary of using that tool . 
  the only way it would realistically be used is if there 's no more majority in the assembly , and the president dissolves it to get one . 
  though there again , he ca n't dissolve it at a whim , there 's a time period of like a year between legislative elections . 
  on the other hand his policies are basically a continuation of hollande and his voter base comes massively from hollande 's in 2012 . 
  he pushed for the economic modernisation of the country , industrialisation , railroads , etc. 
  he also brought france back to an important diplomatic status , and was essential in italian unity . 
  technically you could say napoleon iii is the last monarch ( though emperor , not king ) . 
  but he 's viewed negatively , sadly . 
  romania . 
  them being a latin country and all . 
  poland . 
  historically we have had pretty close ties with poland . 
  tons of people of polish descent here , and in all social classes too , from workers to aristocrats . 
  i do n't know if this counts , but armenia . 
  we have a remarkably strong relationship with them : big armenian community here ( everyone knows charles aznavour , but there are others !, 
  ) , we have shared a great amount of history ( in 1916 , at musa dagh , thousands of armenians bravely resisted the genocide , for 40 days , before the french navy arrived and evacuated them to egypt ; on the other hand , a lot of people remember the armenian manouchian group of resistants during wwii ) . 
  we were the first to recognise the armenian genocide as well . 
  jeans , t-shirt , blazer . 
  no flashy colours . 
  i try to eat varied stuff but my favourite thing ever is cream chicken with mushrooms and rice ( tons of cream ) . 
  with this i 'd drink a glass of * ch\u00e2teau de veyran - clos de l'olivette * which is an excellent red wine at a low price . 
  and lemon tart as a dessert because lemon tart is the tastiest thing ever , tied with my girlfriend 's pussy . 
  absolutely everything , but right now the elections mean i 'm pretty annoyed at ~ ~ fascist catholic scum that we should have finished off in 1793 ~ ~ respectable conservative voters . 
  i have a tendency towards terrifying levels of social anxiety and depression , so eh . 
  calling people autistic is a very bad habit i picked up from the internet . 
  getting angry at people a bit irrationally . 
  * va te faire voir chez les grecs * is really just a way of saying `` go get assfucked '', 
  it 's fascinating to think about , especially as we learn about ancient egypt in school as if it were totally isolated from everywhere else - but they had pretty extensive contacts with the hitties for example ( and of course were invaded by the hyksos , the sea people , etc. 
  there 's an interesting historical theory that all of those were part of a common `` ancient near east '' civilisation - not united in the same way , but rather in the same manner as one would describe modern usa , uk , france , germany , italy , etc. 
  as `` western civilisation '' . 
  late antiquity / fall of the western roman empire . 
  fascinating period , probably one of the most misunderstood and full of misconception ( for instance , the narrative of the `` fall of rome '' is utterly false , as is the idea of `` barbarians at the gates ! '' ) . 
  in the same way i find the post-alexander hellenistic world interesting , what with the wars of the diadochi . 
  what especially interests me is how cultures mixed , in egypt , in iran , and maybe unknown to most , how indian and greek cultures mixed ( for example with greco-buddhist art ) . 
  in general , i have a big interest in these so-called periods of `` decline '' or `` dark ages '' or whatever . 
  the history of the byzantine empire is my major history interest , specifically the reigns of justinian and the macedonian dynasty . 
  i find the eastern roman empire to be the most fascinating civilisation ever , probably the most influential in so many ways post-476 , and yet it has been forgotten and `` lost to the west '' . 
  i also have a passing interest in china in the tang dynasty ( 7th - 11th century ) . 
  possibly the height of chinese power , with a flowering of culture , arts and sciences . 
  in general i feel china is a bit forgotten in the way we learn world history - you kinda feel it 's like `` the west was always top dog except briefly in the middle ages '' , when china kinda was a dominant economic and political power for most of human history ( exagerating a bit there ) , and the 21st century `` rise of china '' is more of a `` rebirth '' after 200 years of decline . 
  definitely not paris . 
  the parisian accent is extremely nasal and sort of unpleasant . 
  it 's like speaking with a permanent bad taste in your mouth . 
  they say the purest french is spoken in tours . 
  levallois-perret is literally the town big the highest debt/inhabitant in france . 
  some people there keep voting for him because deep down they know when the next guy comes up , the gravy train stops there and they 'll have to pay the bill . 
  north : paedophiles , poor , inbred , alcoholics , white trash brittany : alcoholics , ultra-religious , stubborn , always rains south-west : lazy , boorish , and they love rugby south-east : lazy , racist , filthy , crime , also white trash corsica : mafia and terrorists east ( alsace basically ) : extremely conservative , tight-fisted , think they 're germans east ( franche-comt\u00e9 ) : peasants paris : rude , filthy , arrogant , snobby , cold \u00cele-de-france : like the wild west lyon & bordeaux : insufferably provincial little bourgeois anywhere else : peasants, 
  wait , you mean people * should n't * make out in parks ? 
  the most moderate of republicans would be considered a far-right nutter here mate . 
  brogressivism + a weird `` science '' fetish + an unshakeable belief in eugenics . 
  i 'm still riding the smugness from being right about the iraq war tbh . 
  though even those films have some value . 
  the absolute worst are the kev adams films . 
  i 'll also add [ impression , soleil levant ] ( https://impressionismblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/claude_monet_impression_soleil_levant.jpg ) by claude monet , [ le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe ] ( https://www.franceculture.fr/s3/cruiser-production/2016/06/6b121890-a22e-4c70-b7d7-316a49d988ac/600x337_dejeuner_sur_l_herbe.jpg ) by manet , [ la grande odalisque ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/jean_auguste_dominique_ingres%2c_la_grande_odalisque%2c_1814.jpg/1200px-jean_auguste_dominique_ingres%2c_la_grande_odalisque%2c_1814.jpg ) by ingres , ( nsfw ) [ l'origine du monde ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/origin-of-the-world.jpg ) by courbet , [ mort de marat ] ( https://www.histoire-image.org/sites/default/vers10_david_002f.jpg ) by david and [ l'enl\u00e8vement des sabines ] ( https://davidsouslesrevolutions.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/the_intervention_of_the_sabine_women.jpg ) by david again . 
  jacques-louis david and eug\u00e8ne delacroix come the closest to any sort of `` national painter '' . 
  iirc she was in just a few films . 
  hardly a `` pornstar '' . 
  you answered your own question lower , i think . 
  as i said in another comment : we ended up less optimistic according to a poll , then a country that has been a warzone for the last 14 years . 
  hahahaha, 
  it 's super fun , especially because honestly we 're not out to win it , we 're in our own competition with the uk to see who can get the least votes . 
  so we use it to laugh at other countries . 
  alsace is pretty germanic . 
  they 're also the only place on mainland france where secularism is n't applied , which is a historical oddity ~ ~ and also because alsatians are pretty much fascist cunts ~ ~ . 
  parts of the southwest are a bit spanish ( in some of the cities in the south , spanish immigration was so massive that people of spanish descent represent a vast majority , and they have ferias and corridas and whatever ) . 
  obviously french catalan country has a lot in common with catalonia . 
  great excuse to not work, 
  mate , in a recent poll we were less optimistic about the future than the * iraqis * and the * afghans * . 
  we win on pessimism . 
  that sucks . 
  though now on the most important metro lines , the announcements are made in french , english , german , spanish and japanese . 
  strikes are not a bug , they 're a feature . 
  i do n't know about * the * best , but here are the good ones : * [ * le d\u00eener de cons * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119038/ ) * [ * les visiteurs * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108500/ ) * [ * la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 si je mens !, 
  the censorship board 's job is to censor movies * without * naked girls . 
  in general , tits and ass are okay at any time , genitalia is pixelatted , though full frontal nudity for women seems to happen often . 
  in general , we 've avoided voting in the most retarded option possible , so we should be okay !, 
  another thing is that to become president it 's better to not be a former prime minister . 
  pompidou and chirac managed it , but jupp\u00e9 , balladur , jospin , valls failed , and fillon seems to be going the same way . 
  it 's often called the worst job in politics . 
  afaik from german friends and from reddit , arte is well-perceived on both sides of the rhine . 
   tolerance to intolerance is not liberal or left wing , it 's stupid . 
  funny , as right-wingers hate that sort of logic when it 's applied to racists , homophobes , sexists , etc. 
  the over-the-top is n't just for people , it applies to anything from big ass cars to michael bay films to political rallies . 
  there is freedom of religion but it 's understood that that freedom has to have certain limits by law . 
  also freedom of religion is no more important than freedom * from * religion . 
  separation of church and state and secularism are huge things . 
  a general attitude is `` believe what you will , just keep it private '' . 
  generally satisfied but honestly we could afford to be less lax with anti-republican religious traditions . 
  mustering up all the stereotypes i know , the basic gist is `` very friendly people , but loud , over-the-top , ultra-capitalist/materialist cowboys and uncultured '' . 
  unfair stereotyping i know but that 's what stereotypes are . 
  there is some in lorraine , where they sometimes say before drinking wine `` well , at least that 's something the germans wo n't take ! '' . 
  still pretty rare . 
  you forgot * l'original postier d\u00e9livre !, 
  it 's also because in general , family stability and the child 's well-being is more valued than the father realising he 's not the father . 
  i do n't think i really care , if it were legal i would n't care much either .
