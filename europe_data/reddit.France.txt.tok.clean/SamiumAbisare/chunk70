  til cutting off louis xvi 's traitorous head was genocide, 
  * la vie d'ad\u00e8le * ( * blue is the warmest colour * ) . 
  it 's a lesbian love story that deals with themes of identity and existential dread , complete with very graphic sex scenes . 
  literally the frenchest film ever . 
  something like ce soir ou jamais , or cash investigation , would have never existed on tf1 or m6 or whatever . 
  they are n't the same . 
  it 's actually not bad . 
  the evening news is n't great , but it 's miles better than tf1 . 
  they have good investigative and documentary programmes ( such as * cash investigation * , * envoy\u00e9 sp\u00e9cial * ... ) . 
  we have : * france 2 ( generalist ) * france 3 ( emphasis on local news , with different evening news depending on your regiob ) * france \u00d4 ( overseas territories ) * france 24 ( international news ) * france info ( a new , 24/24 rolling news channel ) * france 4 ( whatever stuff they could n't fit in anywhere else ) * france 5 ( documentaries ) every french person of my generation ( in his mid to late twenties ) will have extremely fond memories of science education programme * c'est pas sorcier ! * . 
  and of course there 's arte though that 's shared with germany . 
  all in all the licence fee is pretty justified . 
  i do have depressive tendencies !, 
  not really due to smoking though . 
  it 's just that if we eliminated everything that puts us in danger or was unhealthy pretty soon we 'd have a wonderful life of eating only tofu and drinking grape juice at parties . 
  same thing as everywhere i guess . 
  do n't cry , do n't be too emotional , etc. 
  however one thing that may be different is that knowing how to cook is also a `` manly '' thing , in that you 're expected to know your way around a kitchen . 
  another different thing is that kissing on the cheek as a greeting is acceptable with your close male friends . 
  i wanted to try when i was around 16 , i actually liked it , and still do . 
  feels great after a meal , and as a study break . 
  helps to clear the mind . 
  we 're all going to die anyway , so this way or another , y' know ... 
  get outta here with your filthy gregorian calendars , republican calendar best calendar vend\u00e9miaire ( 22nd september - 21st october ) brumaire ( 22 october - 20 november ) frimaire ( 21 november - 20 december ) niv\u00f4se ( 21 december - 19 january ) pluvi\u00f4se ( 20 january - 18 february ) vent\u00f4se ( 19 february - 20 march ) germinal ( 21 march - 19 april ) flor\u00e9al ( 20 april - 19 may ) prairial ( 20 may - 18 june ) messidor ( 19 june - 18 july ) thermidor ( 18 july - 17 august ) fructidor ( 18 august - 16 september ) 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 and 21st september are the * sans-culottides * , with special names like day of virtue , labour day , etc. 
  21st september is the new year and day of the revolution . 
  years are counted from 1792 . 
  we are , therefore , the 6th of germinal , year 225 of the republic . 
  i think the best summary of european values is given in the [ european charter of fundamental rights ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012p/txt ) adopted in 2000 . 
  the preamble is a good summary of common european values . 
  bit of history here . 
  prior to 1962 , we had a history of very unstable and volatile parliaments , without any clear majority , and government coalitions collapsing one after the other as party alliances changed . 
  think italy until recently . 
  the fourth republic ( 1946-1958 ) was very guilty of this , with governments lasting less than a year on average . 
  so when the 1958 constitution was drafted , article 49.3 was inserted as a way of ensuring governments would be able to still counter parliament . 
  it 's a much more brutal version of germany 's `` constructive no-confidence '' . 
  after 1962 however we started seeing strong and stable majorities , which makes 49.3 redundant . 
  most people actually support him for that , haha . 
  only a few blame him for losing , which is a bit stupid since we did n't lose because of that , but because of one missed penalty kick . 
  i mean he 's quite possibly the greatest football player we ever had ( sorry , platini fans ) and was almost certainly the best european player of the 2000 's , and has a seat on the table of the all-time greats of the game . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.les-transferts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/zidane-sur-larc-de-triomphe.jpg ) is probably the most iconic moment of french sports . 
  not from my country but i do remember seeing a video of belgian ex-mp calling the former belgian pm elio di rupo a paedophile in parliament . 
  of all time : zinedine zidane , no one else even comes close . 
  right now : antoine griezmann and teddy riner in judo . 
  mate my dad is an ex-muslim , i 'm bi and i 've never had any problem in france at all . 
  i 'd ask you to reconsider but realistically the countries with a small muslim population are not going to be gay friendly . 
  not to mention his brother kadoc and his stirring battle cry `` elle est o\u00f9 , la poulette ? '', 
   as for the bonus question , in the country area we have a ton of standing stones but the jury is still out on their exact purpose . 
  +10 % faster progression in your chosen skillset obviously, 
  the first traces of permanent human settlement in paris date back to the prehistoric period . 
  but nobody knows exactly when paris was founded - the city is first mentioned in 53 bce as * lutetia * in julius caesar 's commentaries , as the stronghold of the parisii tribe ( thus the other name , * oppidum parisianorum * ) . 
  it probably started out as a celtic fishing village , and the most likely time for the foundation is around the 3rd century bce , so paris is around 2 300 years old . 
  i generally agree but all remakes are n't bad . 
  the departed is a remake of the hong kong movie infernal affairs , but it 's an excellent film on its own merits . 
  indirectly , he is . 
  people know who 'll be pm if this or that party will have a majority and that factors massively in their vote . 
  `` they are way too commercial and belong to a corporation '' , said the borussia dortmund fan at the signal iduna park and the bayern munich fan at the allianz arena . 
  whatever mate , keep pretending you know us better than we do . 
  i do n't really have to prove anything to you . 
  i do n't follow stand up too much but coluche made as much fun of us than of the belgians . 
  in everyday life self-deprecating humour is very present . 
  we just never show it for foreigners . 
  but i imagine you know better than i do . 
  imagine being with someone who treats you like absolute shit , then at the exact moment when you 're going to speak up , they turn up the sexual tension , and you being a horny little fucker , get trapped every time , and you end up waking up one day next to somebody you despise but still slept with , and you think `` oh my god , is this what i 've become ? 
  am i that desperate ? 
  just for some sex i just traded away all my dignity , self-respect , anything ? 
  am i that worthless ? '' . 
  that 's what insterting your genitalia in crazy does to you . 
  partly that and partly because most of the legislative work is done in parliamentary commissions anyways . 
  fine but as a bi person it 's a different experience i guess . 
  not negative , i think . 
  on the other hand , he was an absolutely brilliant mayor and president of the regional council , helping montpellier become a vibrant , attractive city . 
  also he was the most amazing troll ever , with statements like * `` i get elected by idiots . 
  you do n't win with smart people . 
  there are about 6 % of smart people , 3 % are with me and 3 % are against . 
  i win with the 94 % remaining idiots , i swindle them with my nice face , i tell them a few sex jokes and they 're happy '' * . 
  * `` if you want to learn english , school is useless because the teachers are so bad . 
  if you 're a boy or a girl who wants to learn how to speak english , go to england and fuck people there , it 's the best way to learn . 
  myself i went to england and fucked about 20 girls there , learnt english pretty well but did n't stay because the food was disgusting '' * . 
  there are tons of similar statements like that from him . 
  in montpellier he 's basically a legend . 
  germany , benelux and italy . 
  ** carolingian empire is of rebirthings ** ** imperium francorum stronk ** ** 800 best year of life **, 
  paris ' metro stations also have this . 
  by memory , there 's li\u00e8ge ( formerly berlin ) , anvers , stalingrad , sebastopol , crim\u00e9e , solferino ( also a famous street ) , bir hakeim , argentine , europe , rome ... also the street names will also vary if the city is a political stronghold of the left or right . 
  so you have tons of solzhenytsin streets in conservative cities , while left wing cities will have lenin street , robespierre street , etc. 
  he also was a big sinophile and talked about mao 's role in the rise ( re-rise , really ) of china . 
  also he said `` fuck you '' to the controversy by distributing free lenin t-shirts referencing lenin 's big dick on the day the plaza was inaugurated ( i have one ! ) . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2010/09/03/201009031805.jpg ) is a photo of him showing off one of those sweet t-shirts . 
  the text reads `` and in private , they called him babar '' ( babar the elephant ... y' know ... ), 
  i also recommend the history of byzantium podcast , nice for commutes !, 
  liberator of the nation from the yolk of the monarchy or instigator of the great terror and murderer of hundreds of thousands ... maybe both ? 
  revered by the extreme left , not so much by the conservatives . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maximilien_robespierre robespierre is such a complex figure . 
  he spoke so eloquently about the abolition of the death penalty , yet is associated with the reign of terror . 
  he 's seen as a dictator , but he saw himself as `` just the first citizen '' . 
  he 's seen as bloodthirsty , but there were way worse people than him , especially h\u00e9bert and the exalted . 
  on the one hand , he and the comittee for public safety probably saved the country and the revolution . 
  on the other hand , their actions led to their own downfall , which would bring about the corrupt and inefficient directoire , which would lead to the dictatorship of napoleon . 
  i know !, 
  really depends on the field you 're in though .
