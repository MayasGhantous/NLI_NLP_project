  ( ... ) a king must be put on trial , not for the crimes of his administration , but for the crime of being a king , for nothing in the world can legitimise this usurpation . 
  and whatever illusion , whatever conventions royalty drapes itself in , it is an eternal crime against which any man has the right to arm against ( ... )  citizens , one can not reign innocently . 
  that folly is evident . 
  all kings are rebels and usurpers . 
  also this one from georges danton at the national assembly , 2nd september 1792 , as the austrian and prussian armies invade and the assembly had declared `` the fatherland in danger '' :  we ask that you join us in governing this sublime movement of the people , by naming officials that will help us in these great policies . 
  we ask that anyone who refuses to serve be punished by death . 
  we ask that instruction be given to citizens to direct their movements . 
  ( ... )  the bell that tolls is not an alarm signal , it is the charge against all enemies of the fatherland . 
  to vanquish , gentlemen , we need audacity , more audacity , always audacity , and france will be saved . 
  that speech inspired alarm bells to be rung all over the country , with thousands joining the army which became a true citizen 's army . 
  on 20th september 1792 they would beat the prussian army at the battle of valmy , and on 21st september 1792 , the monarchy was officially abolished and the republic proclaimed . 
  i also like clemenceau 's speech at the national assembly for the ratification of the armistice in 1918 . 
  clemenceau , a hardcore republican who was nicknamed `` the tiger '' , had said , when he took office as prime minister in 1917 : `` domestic policy : war . 
  foreign policy : war '' . 
   gentlemen , there is only one way of accepting the hommage of the assemblies of the people : it is to promise , all of us , to always work with all the strength of our hearts for the public good . 
   for me , reading the armistice , it seems that in this hour , this terrible hour , this great and magnificent hour , my duty is accomplished . 
   one more word . 
  in the name of the french people , in the name of the government of the french republic , i send the salute of france one and undivided to recovered alsace and lorraine . 
   and honour to our great dead who have made this victory . 
  by them , before all armistice , we can say france was liberated by the force of arms . 
   to the living , we give out our hand , and we will welcome them , when they march on our boulevards , going to the ark of triumph , may they be saluted in advance . 
  we wait for them for the great work of social reconstruction . 
   thanks to them , france , yesterday soldier of god , today soldier of mankind , will always be soldier of the ideal . 
  the finest hour speech is amazing , i know the last paragraph by heart . 
  i mean potatoes and chocolate are n't either . 
  yes , up to a point . 
  for example non-french eu residents shouldn ' y have the right to vote for national elections ( but every right to vote in local and european ones ) and be blocked from holding key posts in government ( defense , foreign affairs , national security ) . 
  apart from that , yeah . 
  * * ast\u00e9rix et ob\u00e9lix : mission cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre * is very quotable . 
  * the * oss 117 * films as well . 
  * * les visiteurs * , a medieval knight and his servant time travel to the 20th century . 
  very funny and i think everyone in france remembers the * `` messire !, 
  '' * scene . 
  * * la cit\u00e9 de la peur * is the ultimate cult film . 
  * finally * la classe am\u00e9ricaine * which is less of a film and more of a big montage of a gazillion hollywood films , with fake dubbing making for a nonsensical plot about investigating the death of georges abitbol , `` the classiest man in the world '' . 
  sparkling water and wine . 
  there 's a book by phillipe s\u00e9guin called * louis-napol\u00e9on le grand * that does a good job rehabilitating napoleon iii . 
  also jospin 's book * le mal napol\u00e9onien * goes to show why napoleon may have been a bad influence in the long run . 
  the narrative has become a bit more balanced even if overall napoleon is still viewed positively . 
  outside of his military achievements , the renewed stability after the revolution , the educational and cultural reforms are talked about , and especially the greatest achievement was the civil code , which really ended feudalism for good , entrenched quite a bit of the revolution 's ideals ( equality before the law , etc. 
  ) , not only in france but all over continental europe . 
  on the other hand , there has been more emphasis on napoleon 's dictatorship , his re-institution of slavery in the caribbean , his personal discouragement of the industrial revolution , the fact that he left the country in 1815 ruined and smaller than it had been when he had taken it . 
  but still , overall , positive . 
  the real controversial figure is napoleon iii , who ruled during the second empire in 1851 - 1870 . 
  he gets a bad reputation because of the military defeat to prussia in 1870 , but in many regards , he was much better than napoleon i , modernising the country economically , regaining massive diplomatic influence , italian unity , railroads , etc. 
  i know i know ... 
  he still was * rex francorum * though !, 
  that counts !, 
  i mean it 's balanced out by the 18-25 forum so yeah . 
  uk : winston churchill . 
  germany : bismarck , frederick the great . 
  adenauer seems very admired too . 
  the hero of the two worlds . 
  such a badass . 
  greece : reading up on byzantine history and justinian and basil ii are really amazing . 
  spain : huh , do n't really know spanish history that well . 
  i 'll go with francisco de vitoria who was one of the first to theorise international law . 
  russia : he was an awful person , but lenin had an amazing mind . 
  do n't know too many czars apart from ivan , peter and catherine sooooo ... turkey : mustapha kemal, 
   germany : charlemagne * triggered *, 
  sadiq khan is n't handsome but he definitely has his charm !, 
  ymmv but i like [ fleur pellerin ] ( http://img-3.journaldesfemmes.com/bqeirrgxuznfkgtvpiscrri_rn8=/2093x/smart/image-cms/10123899.jpg ) ( socialist ) . 
  [ nathalie kosciusko-morizet ] ( http://img2.closermag.fr/var/closermag/storage/images/media/images-des-contenus/actu-people/politique/20160307-nkm-une/natalie-kosciusko-morizet-en-campagne-en-2014/5109810-1-fre-fr/natalie-kosciusko-morizet-en-campagne-en-2014_exact1024x768_l.jpg ) ( right-wing ) is n't too bad either . 
  also [ barbara pompili ] ( http://md1.libe.com/photo/458173-pompili_web.jpg?modified_at=1348738496&amp;width=960 ) ( greens ) . 
  on the men 's side i 'll add [ arnaud montebourg ] ( http://mediamass.net/jdd/public/documents/celebrities/1084.jpg ) and some find [ manuel valls ] ( http://lyyn.fr.nf/photoshow/?t=thb&amp;f=manuel+valls%2fvalls_toulouse_2012.jpg ) handsome as well . 
  not a policitian , strictly speaking , though he was close to delano\u00eb circles , the president of radio france , and alleged secret lover of emmanuel macron , [ mathieu gallet ] ( http://i.f1g.fr/media/ext/805x453_crop/www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2015/03/23/phob631f892-d152-11e4-805e-b634697bff7f-805x453.jpg ) could pretty much be a male model . 
  david lynch for his creativity . 
  john steinbeck and ernest hemingway because * the grapes of wrath * and * the old man and the sea * had a big influence on me as a teen . 
  i have some admiration for lincoln ( reading * a team of rivals * was a pleasure ) and fdr ( minus japanese internment camps ) . 
  politically lbj i find very interesting , hugely controversial because of vietnam but judging by the legislation he managed to pass , he looks like america 's most progressive president ever . 
  also known as `` the thing you watch while hungover on a sunday morning while you wait for t\u00e9l\u00e9foot to start '' . 
  r/france is pretty cool even if it 's a massive leftist circlejerk and the mods are nazis . 
  the daily open forum is fun though . 
  victor hugo . 
  charles de gaulle . 
  louis pasteur . 
  strongly pro-choice , and abortion should be safe , accessible and free . 
  however , it can be a very traumatic event which why we need more sex ed and awareness , for both boys and girls , about contraception . 
  filthy casual !, 
  boomers , generation y and z are used . 
  greatest generation and lost generation are specifically american though . 
  i think india and a south american country should be into the permanent unsc . 
  hmm . 
  just my feeling of it , i 'm not an anime or manga fan so i would n't know . 
  i know people who like that stuff and it just seems to me that liking it is n't seen as weird ( especially naruto which really seems like the younger generations ' dragon ball z ) , unless you go full weeb , i guess . 
  some stuff like naruto or one pieace are n't exactly mainstream but have a big enough following to not be weird or have a stigma to them . 
  i would still say `` none '' , but i 'm not too sure of anything . 
  i think a majority of french people reject the eu as it stands now and would probably vote `` no '' to any new european treaty , but actually leaving the eu ? 
  not sure . 
  i do n't think we would . 
  i sure as well hope not , since that would basically choosing to be irrelevant . 
  there are quite a few but the undisputed one would be the 17th century , called `` the great century '' ( * le grand si\u00e8cle * ) , basically the reigns of henri iv , louis xiii and louis xiv ( the famous sun king ) . 
  generally remembered as a golden age of prosperity , peace ( the kingdom had just come out of the bloody wars of religion between catholics and protestants ) , as well as a great time for art : moli\u00e8re , corneille , racine , jean de la fontaine , etc. 
  as well as great statesmen such as colbert . 
  just adding that the most recent poll shows fillon dropping below 20 % and macron getting to 2nd place . 
  any rise or decrease in the polls for le pen is probably unrelated to trump . 
  i guess to most of us it 's just `` oh , those ` muricans ... '' . 
  also abortion is covered by social security . 
  do n't forget enzo and vanessa . 
  basically a huge `` white trash '' signal .
