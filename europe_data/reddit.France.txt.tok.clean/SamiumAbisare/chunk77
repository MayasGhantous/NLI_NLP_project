  - also is the `` chief of all armies '' being directly elected by the people , he has immense democratic legitimacy compared to the prime minister . 
  therefore , even though constitutionally the president names the pm and the pm selects his government , in practice the government is pretty much selected by the president . 
  this of course depends on the relationship between the president and the pm ( for example sarkozy was all over ministerial appointments , whereas chirac left it mostly to his pms ) . 
  it 's generally understood that the president should at the very least select the minister for foreign affairs and the minister of defense . 
  the president also has a direct role in shaping and formulating government policy , as well as the premium role in diplomatic affairs ( the pm has very little place in french diplomacy , it 's generally president + foreign affairs minister ) . 
  finally he 's the sole guy who can use the nuclear * force de frappe * . 
  so yeah , he 's pretty powerful . 
  the montparnasse tower in paris . 
  the sacr\u00e9 coeur church in montmartre . 
  the entire city of n\u00eemes . 
  politically germany , culturally italy . 
  i have a theory that british girls have some kind of frost resistance . 
  that 's more of an income split than a cultural/generational split , is n't it ? 
  poets and poetry are pretty important - at school we 're expected to learn a lot of poems by heart , politicians will quote poems in their speeches , and some poets such as charles baudelaire and victor hugo are household names . 
  victor hugo is our `` national '' poet in many ways . 
  for the same reason i hate the idea of a party that represents christian or jewish or buddhist interests . 
  political parties should represent the common , national interest ( or at the very least what their idea of it is ) . 
  not particular ones . 
  that being said : if there is such a thing as a christian-democrat party , on what grounds can you ban a muslim-democrat party ? 
  a memorial to the fallen french and german soldiers of the battle of verdun , it has the remains and bones of about 130 000 unnamed soldiers . 
  i visited it when i was a kid with my parents and it has never completely left me . 
  not that much , i think . 
  i might be mistaken though . 
  i feel that the real split we have is between the urban population and the `` peri-urban '' + rural population . 
  * charles de gaulle . 
  i mean , the guy is probably the greatest french person who ever lived . 
  distinguished soldier , visionary military thinker , leader of the resistance , rebuilder of the country , always with the ideal of `` make france great again '' . 
  also he pissed off the anglos which is always a plus . 
  * michel rocard , socialist prime minister from 1988 - 1991 , under president mitterrand . 
  enacted a shit ton of progressive and smart policies , as well as a realistic solution to the new caledonia issue . 
  * lionel jospin , socialist prime minister from 1997 - 2002 . 
  last guy under which we had real , sustained economic growth and falling unemployment ( and were considered more dynamic than germany !, 
  good times ) . 
  enacted progressive laws ( universal health coverage , 35 hour work week , laws on rights , civil unions for all couples ) as well as modernising the economy ( privatising what needed to be privatised , etc. ) . 
  the fact that this country , in the 2002 presidential election , chose perennial corrupt liar jacques chirac who put the country to sleep for 5 more years , and fascist jean-marie le pen ahead of jospin shows the truth in the saying * `` les fran\u00e7ais sont des veaux '' * . 
  * pierre mend\u00e8s france , prime minister ( or more correctly president of the council of ministers ) for 7 months between 1954 and 1955 , during the extremely unstable and volatile 4th republic . 
  this badass came to power in the wake of the disaster of dien bien ph\u00fb , saying he would negotiate peace within a month . 
  he did , and managed to negotiate a peace settlement in indochina while at the same time granting that country independence . 
  he also began the steps that would lead to the relatively painless independence of morroco and tunisia . 
  he also put on the road to nuclear energy and nuclear power . 
  elected as the popular front candidate , he enacted a radical reform programme ( more due to the massive strikes than anything else ) : 40 hour work week , the first paid vacations , the first real vacation time , a lot of social rights , etc. 
  for a long time he was revered by the working class as the guy who made them feel a part of society for the first time . 
  alas , the `` wall of money '' as they called it got the better of him . 
  * georges clemenceau , prime minister 1917 - 1920 : nicknamed `` the tiger '' , he famously said when entering office in 1917 : `` war is too important to be left to the military '' . 
  foreign policy : war '' ) . 
  his leadership was a factor in the final victory . 
  back in the 1880s he was also the only member of parliament to oppose colonisation - when people told him colonisation was to civilise the inferior races , he went into an epic rant exposing that bullshit . 
  he also was the snarkiest motherfucker ever ( `` the staircase of a government office is a place where people who are late cross people who leave early '' , `` english is just very badly pronounced french '' , and the best one of all : `` the graveyards are full of irreplaceable men who have all been replaced '' ) . 
  also not a president or a prime minister but i have a lot of admiration for nicolas de condorcet , a thinker of the enlightenment , a math and science genius , and also radically progressive for the 18th century , where he called for equal rights for women and black people . 
  ... my political biases are pretty transparent i guess . 
  until that point when you realise that you 're enduring titanic amounts of bullshit and what could be called emotional abuse just because of sex and that you 've gone down pretty low because your dick is doing the thinking for you . 
  it 's ... not a good feeling :( but to the point : yeah she was pretty hot . 
  way out of my league . 
  not my ex though . 
  1/10 would not recommend sticking genitalia in crazy . 
  the hairy women thing is more of an american stereotype . 
  the animals thing was a massive circlejerk on askreddit because some asshole french tourists in australia mistreated an animal there . 
  then it went over to the horror of foie gras , and rainbow warrior , and that we hate animals , with a few people talking about animals left to die around the eiffel tower when tourists are n't there . 
  latin europe stronk, 
  where do we begin ... * yes , we do have a military , that 's been operating around the world for some time . 
  and the world 's third biggest stockpile of nuclear weapons . 
  * by the way , we did n't wait for the terrorist attacks to act against islamic terrorism - we 've been in afghanistan since the beginning , fought them in mali and operation barkhane in west africa right now is basically one of the largest anti-terrorism military operations ever . 
  * there are n't `` no go zones '' . 
  * spitting on veiled women is n't a national sport . 
  * we 're fully aware of the negatives parts of our history . 
  * we 're just bad at english , there 's no grand conspiracy to not speak it because of linguistic pride . 
  * we do n't hate animals and there are n't cadavers of horses and dogs around the eiffel tower . 
  * we 're not on the brink of sharia law . 
  * women are n't hairy . 
  * we 're not prideful or nationalists . 
  in fact we probably beat world records in self-depreciation . 
  we just hate it when anybody else does it for us !, 
  well , first , tipping culture stems from the fact that a lot of waiters in the us are paid very little ( and people actually defend this saying `` but then the meal would be much more expensive ! '' ) . 
  the other thing is that tipping culture is that it 's linked to the american idea of service , which i find abhorrent , where waiters have to be super-smiley , come every 5 seconds to check if you 're having a good time , whatever . 
  i hate that . 
  just come , take the order , fuck off and come back when we 'll pay . 
  do n't ingratiate yourself this way . 
  when i went to the us ( washington and maryland ) , a waitress was a bit offended when me and my friends tried to tell her as politely as we could that she really did n't need to come every 5 seconds . 
  did n't get it then but i think that she imagined that we were trying to weasel our way out of tips . 
  of course , a lot of american tourists think waiters who do this are unspeakably rude and that the service is terrible ... ( not saying one way or the other is better , to each his own ) . 
  i used to live in one of the `` no-go zones '' in paris . 
  so yeah , in the fox news sense it 's complete bullshit . 
  i 'm still an avid civ 4 player ( civ 4 bts is the best civilization game , and yes , i will fight you on that ) . 
  i 've played extensively with just about every civilisation in the game and i have to say , the dutch , the maya , the inca and the khmer really are the best in that game . 
  its reasonable to defend your home in case of intrusion or attack or whatever . 
  not so much , in my opinion , to shoot people when they steal your tv . 
  they have one of the oldest welfare states in europe and a strong social-democratic tradition . 
  hjalmar branting , one of the first social-democratic politicians to rise to national office in sweden , was very influenced by eduard bernsteins ' reformist marxism , and it helped shape sweden 's vision of a social-democratic welfare state . 
  also culturally , scandinavian culture as a whole seems to have put a huge accent on egalitarianism . 
  as an aside , i find it funny that on reddit , sweden is either considered an egalitarian , progressive utopia or a rape-filled islamist hellhole . 
  gaza is n't the only part of palestine but i 'm not getting into that debate anyway . 
  it 's not a paradox , most people are for `` free palestine but without hamas '' . 
  just as its possible to support a syria that is without bashar and without islamists , etc. 
  : comes from [ this famous video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lseuqn_erru ) where lyon goalkeeper makes a great save , then shits himself and gives a goal away , the commentators ' reactions have become memetic . 
  * [ jawad , isis landlord ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=jawad+meme&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1543&amp;bih=776&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjjs5htidxpahuhvhqkhwucbk4q_auibigb ) : the owner of the appartment where the group that carried out the november 13th attacks were found , and he said on tv that he did n't know they were terrorists , so obviously everybody made fun of him . 
  * [ christophe de margerie ( ceo of total ) , an angel that left us too soon ] ( https://fr-fr.facebook.com/christophe-de-margerie-un-ange-parti-trop-t%c3%b4t-1473761312907156/ ) : christophe de margerie was the ceo of total and he died recently , and a lot of politicians , even left-wing ones , said how great he was . 
  even though he did a lot of shady shit and total is a good candidate for `` evil corp '' . 
  * short-lived but there was a thing about patrice evra saving the country during the november 13th attacks , based on [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi_5snuwcpm ) * `` en pls '' = `` in lateral security position '' , an equivalent to `` rekt '' . 
  * the `` el risitas '' meme , a pretty weird one about [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdib4rtp1qw ) . 
  not french per se ( there 's an absolutely hilarious one about brexit ) though , but french users have taken it up to 11 , the whole `` issou '' thing .
