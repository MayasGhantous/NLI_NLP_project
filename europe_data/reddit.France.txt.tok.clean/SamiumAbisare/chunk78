  * a pretty old one and dead now , but back in 2006 it was really big : `` les no\u00eblistes '' ( noelism ) . 
  basically the jeuxvideo.com forums had [ this ] ( https://wiki.jvflux.com/images/f/fe/noel.gif ) emote , called `` noel '' . 
  and people started posting it after every message , then they called themselves `` noelists '' , began joking about it as if it were a cult , and started doing website defacement and stuff . 
  they also managed to rile up a two-bit rapper called morsay ( more on this guy later ) who posted videos with his pseudo-ghetto friends about how he would fuck noelists ' mothers . 
  they also got coverage here and there in the press as a `` far right '' group . 
  * morsay / truands de la gal\u00e8re : a useless rapper from clignancourt , their only real song is called `` on s ` en bat les couilles '' ( `` we do n't give a shit '' ) where they just hang around with fake guns and repeat this over and over . 
  he 's mostly known for videos where he and his friends keep insulting the camera for no real reason , stuff like `` i fuck you , your wife , your mother , your father , your grandmother , your dog , i take 10 $ and i call a gay , we attach you in the truck and he fucks you in the ass , now click on my videos sluts '' . 
  * moundir : a participant of koh lanta ( local version of * survivor * , known because he kept getting into fights with people , his sexist remarks , his creative expressions , etc. 
  on his second stint on the show , when he was eliminated he screamed `` no honour !, 
  why so corrupt ! '', 
  so you see that sometimes . 
  * former right-wing minister nadine morano ( of `` i 'm not racist , i have a tchadian friend who 's even more black than arabs '' fame ) and christian party leader christine boutin are living memes as well . 
  apart from a few far-left loonies and one or two twisted extreme far right-wingers , europeans do n't support hamas , but a lot of europeans do support a free palestine . 
  note also that it 's not uniform across europe - france has traditionally been close to the arab countries , whereas germany and the uk are huge supports to israel . 
  funnily enough , only one kiss means real closeness . 
  fuck , forgot about that one !, 
  some relatively recent films : [ blue is the warmest colour . 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img5.acsta.net/pictures/210/359/21035935_20130903173858999.jpg ) a really beautiful film , do n't let its reputation fool you . 
  `` came for the porn , stayed for the amazing movie '' is a very common opinion !, 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img6.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/82/69/17/19806656.jpg ) very rich guy who suffers from paralysis gets a full-time helper from the ghettos . 
  it 's really pretty funny , and based on a true story too . 
  a good prison flick . 
  it 's a fairly classic and traditional rise-and-fall story , but it 's pretty well made . 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img6.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/36/10/96/19649758.jpg ) it 's probably the film i find the funniest ever . 
  a lot of jokes are probably lost in translation , though ... there 's an american remake called a dinner for schmucks but watching the trailer , it looks like it sucks balls . 
  a wwi film about a woman whose fianc\u00e9 is reported dead but she does n't believe it and goes looking out for him . 
  [ oss 117 : le caire nid d'espions ] ( http://fr.web.img5.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/35/95/94/18602611.jpg ) and [ oss 117 : rio ne r\u00e9pond plus ] ( http://fr.web.img4.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/67/41/85/19057747.jpg ) . 
  a parody of the james bond genre . 
  ] ( http://fr.web.img6.acsta.net/medias/nmedia/18/36/07/69/18659413.jpg ) comedy about a knight and his servant who time-travel to 1993 . 
  again , most of the jokes are lost in translation , i guess . 
  in terms of actual bribes i 'd say pretty low . 
  in terms of conflicts of interest , high . 
  he has about a gazillion scandals by this point . 
  his campaign is basically going full trump . 
  he just says dumb populist shit . 
  i mean he used to do that but now he 's taking it up to eleven . 
  some of his proposals are downright dangerous . 
  i do n't know , somwhere i think that he did believe that he was building the socialist utopia . 
  then again , he twisted marxist thought so weirdly that it could hardly be called marxist anymore ( like that phrase where he says the soviet union needs to be the strongest form of state power so that it can ensure the `` withering away of the state '' ... ) . 
  they all were for the `` world revolution '' , even if stalin took up bukharin 's theory of `` socialism in one country '' . 
  then again , stalin also very successfully sowed the seeds of communist expansion in the world . 
  my point was that had trotsky been leader of the soviet union instead of being shafted by stalin , he would probably have been worse . 
  also lenin did n't have absolute power alone , he was more like `` just the first citizen '' . 
  he had to manage with all the tendencies of the bolsheviks . 
  stalin did n't either at first but then he outpoliticked everyone then purged them . 
   we have some nice stripclubs in copenhagen can confirm . 
  * looks down in shame *, 
  honestly i think trotsky was worse than lenin . 
  trotsky was the one who cracked down on the soviets , militarised the trade unions , and asked to step up the `` dictatorship '' . 
  he also hated lenin 's idea of the nep - he wanted communism to be applied directly and brutally * now * and fuck the consequences , lenin was much more pragmatic on that front . 
  hell stalin was more pragmatic early on than trotsky . 
  obviously . 
  at least they had some facial hair . 
  i think the worst is pretty much settled ~ ~ and it 's nicolas sarkozy ~ ~ . 
  for `` best '' , you could make an argument for winston churchill on many points . 
  or dag hammarskj\u00f6ld , really , even if he did n't a lead a country . 
  on the european level , jacques delors as president of the eu commission did the most to advance the eu . 
  montgomery will be more renowned because alamein , but if i 'm not mistaken slim was considered the superior commander . 
   scientists * ( not so many u fockin ' wot m8 ? 
  i 'd say paving the way for computers is a pretty big deal . 
  does n't the charter for the environment count ? 
  because calling a country a `` non-country '' is the true mark of a gentleman . 
  i used to date a british girl but she brexited , the `` distance '' and the expense of traveling every other weekend was becoming a bit too much for the both of us . 
  not a word , but the city blackburn just makes me chuckle immaturely ( in french , `` burnes '' is a slang word for balls ) . 
  just paris , nuke the rest of the ungrateful cow-fucking peasants for all i care . 
  true , but then again , we sometimes call french * la langue de moli\u00e8re * , or moli\u00e8re 's language . 
  * * douche \u00e9cossaise * ( scottish shower ) : a very cold shower * * filer \u00e0 l'anglaise * ( leave the english way ) : leave without telling anybody * * aller se faire voir chez les grecs * ( go get seen at the greeks ' ) : eh , i think it means `` fuck off '' or `` go get fucked '' . 
  * * le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone arabe * ( arab telephone ) : distorted rumours * * t\u00eate de turc * ( turk head ) : scapegoat * * aux calendes grecques * ( to greek calendes ) : putting off indefinitely * * les anglais d\u00e9barquent * ( the english are landing ) : menstruation * specifically used in alsace and moselle : * c'est toujours \u00e7a que les allemands / les boches auront pas !, 
  * ( at least that 's something the germans / the boches wo n't have ! ), 
  : said when somebody eats the last piece of food * * branlette espagnole * ( spanish wanking ) : nice name for a tittyfuck probably forgot a few and left out the racist ones . 
  also a guy who was convicted for fraud and had to exile himself to canada . 
  and from a left-wing view his programme is a bit ... bleh . 
  obviously hard to say but i do n't hate matthias fekl , our current junior minister for foreign trade . 
  a pretty smart guy with a bazillion diplomas ( including from the ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure , which is reserved to the best of the best of the best ) , and is actually kinda sorta left-wing . 
  also people should remember that beloved political figures of the past were , in their time , as controversial as figures today . 
  eh , zombie shows have lost their novelty , and even in twd you can see they 're really scraping the bottom . 
  i 'd love to see a fallout set in paris though . 
  weight and height , but the montparnasse tower predates those regulations i believe . 
  the tour first is n't in paris per se though . 
  * to not elect sarkozy . 
  * to enforce secularism at all levels , instead of pandering to religious minorities for votes as it happens in certain areas . 
  * reform state spending * reform payroll taxes * do n't elect sarkozy * stop with excessive foreign intervention - let 's concentrate where we can ( west africa ) . 
  no need for adventurist politics . 
  * somewhere down the line , leave nato 's integrated military command again . 
  * to not ratify ttip or ceta . 
  * actually return to the pre-sarkozy days of having an independent foreign policy and not being america 's lapdog * small one , but grant political asylum for edward snowden . 
  the tallest building in paris proper is [ the montparnasse tower ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tour_montparnasse#/media/file:tour_montparnasse_view_arc.jpg ) with 210m . 
  it 's probably the most ugly thing ever conceived by human minds . 
  a common parisian saying is that the best view of the city is from the montparnasse tower because its the only place where you ca n't see it . 
  if you count the la d\u00e9fense business district , then it 's the [ tour first ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tour_first#/media/file:tour_first.jpg ) which is 231m . 
  hillary clinton is definitely hawkish but not a unilateralist . 
  it 's fair to say , i think , that she would n't be like george w. bush in that regard - multilateralism is her thing , and let 's not forget she was a proponent of the deal with iran . 
  trump ... yeah , you could say he 's non-interventionist . 
  you could also remember his comments about `` i 'm going to bomb isis and take their oil '' . 
  or his general incompetence at foreign policy . 
  definitely helpful , but it was n't done out of pure kindness as some pretend . 
  marshall understood very well that impoverished european countries would be a breeding ground for communism . 
  also , a poor war-wrecked europe is n't a very good market for american companies . 
  the cults around elon musk and steve jobs are frightening . 
  enlightened people who scoff at personality cults in totalitarian regimes then go off to worship entrepreneurs .
