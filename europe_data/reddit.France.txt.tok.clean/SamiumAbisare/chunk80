  not really but i 'd say lyon . 
  nice city with a lot to do and see , friendlier and less stressful than paris , economically doing rather well . 
  yeah , sorry to break it to you like this but living in the usa is n't everybody 's n \u00b0 1 dream . 
  what about limoges ? 
  the city is so boring that * \u00eatre limog\u00e9 * ( `` to be limoged '' ) means getting fired . 
  yeah , i moved from montpellier in the south to paris , which is about 800km away . 
  though it 's not that far when you think about it because it 's about 3 hours away by train . 
  [ sure is !, 
  the irony is more that when the song starts you really do n't expect it to be about a un official , and this sort of politics is supposed to be `` boring '' , and here 's a really catchy , loud tune about it . 
  it 's a tribute disguised as a completely over the top song . 
  the other thing is that they tend to `` catch up '' with native french birth rates pretty quickly . 
  jan egeland is a norwegian politician who held a very high post in the un and worked on many diplomatic and humanitarian projects . 
  most notably he was instrumental in the oslo accords between israel and palestine ( the closest those two ever came to peace ) . 
  the funny thing is that generally this kind of guy does n't have songs dedicated to him .

  the parisian breakfast : a coffee and a cigarette . 
  when you see [ some ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ludovine_de_la_roch%c3%a8re ) [ people ] ( http://referentiel.nouvelobs.com/wsfile/5181369675593.jpg ) , you definitely think that we did n't finish the job in 1793 . 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_3izwytgc4 ) ( `` during the war , we handed over the jews , but we never handed over the good mushroom spots ! '' ), 
  we do n't really . 
  some years back people tried bringing it , but it was mainly commercial and never caught on . 
  we have all saint 's day , which is `` celebrated '' by not working . 
  i read a book about mafia organisations throughout the world , one of the points was that the mafia is n't this glamorous godfather-type underground thing anymore , it has mixed itself a lot with the `` legal '' economy now , with most mafia bosses being more like ceos than al capone . 
  what i ca n't believe is that so many people can twist their brains in such a way to actually imply that waiters or shopkeepers or employees of a clothing store do n't deserve common courtesy `` because their job is to serve me '' . 
  `` i had to say ` bonjour ' when entering a shop , god these french people are rude '' . 
  `` french people are extremely racist and hate muslims and black people '' . 
  i see this shit all the time . 
  fun info but we did come up with the real nice `` unitedstatesian '' ( * `` etats-unien '' * ) instead of `` american '' . 
  not very widely used though . 
  dom-tom is the old name for these territories , it means * d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer * and * territoires d'outre-mer * . 
  it 's an old administrative designation that 's no longer officially in use ( replaced by the drom and com ones ) but it 's the one most people are still familiar with . 
  british english , the only real english , not the dialect of the 13 colonies . 
  basically you have 3 categories . 
  * the * d\u00e9partements et r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer * ( overseas departments and regions ) , or drom , that are 100 % french , have the euro , and french and eu law applies to them fully ( with the possibility of some local adaptation ) . 
  these are guadeloupe and martinique in the caribbean , guyane in south america , la r\u00e9union and mayotte in the indian ocean . 
  they 're represented in parliament and there are a handfull in the european parliament as well . 
  * the * collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer * ( overseas collectivites ) , or com . 
  they have specific institutions and laws , but a fair number of metropolitan laws apply to them as well . 
  these are saint-pierre-et-miquelon off the coast of canada , saint-barth\u00e9l\u00e9my and saint-martin in the caribbean , and wallis-et-futuna and french polynesia in the pacific . 
  * finally , the specific cases : new caledonia , which has an entirely different status . 
  they have their own institutions and are much more autonomous . 
  they will be voting soon-ish in a referendum to choose between remaining in france as a collectivity , becoming an associate state with france , or full independence . 
  also , clipperton is under direct control of the government , and terre-ad\u00e9lie in antarctica is ... i dunno . 
  we do n't really think about them too much since they 're really on the other side of the world and do n't make it very often in the news . 
  mayotte recently had a very big general strike and the media did n't cover it for a long time , until it became too big to ignore . 
  legally the * d\u00e9partements et r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer * are as much a part of the country as paris is ( which means that , as per the eu and schengen , any european can go and settle just like that in the amazon forest if he wants to , heh ) . 
  the other territories definitely have a different status , i do n't think we can really consider new caledonia `` french '' considering the very painful history ( and absolutely shameful treatment of the kanak peoples by france , which is an incredibly dark part of our history that 's not often mentioned ) . 
  other territories do n't have many people , if at all on them , so it does n't matter . 
  the main problem with them is that their local economies are really not that great , and without the french government they would be worse off . 
  you 'll find one or two racists going on about how they leech off the mainland , but eh . 
  in reality , they have economic value if only because of the territorial waters and exclusive economic zone ( also , clipperton , an island in the pacific ocean , is literally a giant toilet for birds , they just keep shitting there , so it 's a neat source of guano ) . 
  the place most people have a problem is is mayotte , since it was granted `` d\u00e9partement '' status very recently , more or less has sharia law and a huge immigration problem with pregnant women crossing over from the comores to give birth in mayotte and thus on french soil . 
  that 's a pain . 
  otherwise , nobody i know considers la r\u00e9union , guyane or guadeloupe and martinique as `` not french '' . 
  hell they 've been french for longer than a ton of white french people . 
  the most i see is `` they 're very different but they 're still ` us ' '' . 
  also , they 're very desirable destinations for civil servants and teachers because the salaries are way better than for metropolitan civil servants . 
  i like the situation as it is . 
  only citizens can vote on national elections , but eu citizens have a special status where they can vote on local government ( which directly affects expats ) and pan-european elections . 
  p\u00e9tain also gave us mother 's day and the pension system . 
  i 'm amazed , i find london to be an amazingly friendly city . 
  what is this `` hospitable '' thing you speak of ? 
  she 's really famous here , do n't worry . 
  i follow a lot of foreign politics and by far the funniest is american politics . 
  nothing compares to it . 
  even the australians do n't come close . 
  i followed the republican primaries even before trump stepped in , back when scott walker was the biggest thing . 
  the bible-thumping and `` jeebus guides my every step !!! '', 
  was hilarious . 
  then again , that was before we all started talking about fucking burkinis here , so i guess we 've lost to right to feel smug . 
  my ( indian ) aunt had a very bad experience in a shop in paris . 
  first thing i asked her was `` did you say `` bonjour ? '' . 
  she said no , she went straight to ask `` do you have this in this size '' , in english . 
  i facepalmed a bit . 
  the worst is people who think this is stupid `` because they 're supposed to service me !!!! '' . 
  fuck that . 
  they 're human beings , not your servants . 
  i absolutely hate this servile approach to customer service . 
  yeah , i just used the most obvious example . 
  in general , whatever the party in power , uk foreign policy has always been very aligned with the us one . 
  i 'm not criticising by the way , since a ) there 's nothing inherently wrong with this b ) we 're kinda doing the same thing now ( we even cancelled the mistral sale to russia because of us pressure ... ) . 
  my point being that the usa has a gigantic influence in european countries ' foreign policies , with a particular influence with the uk . 
  about the eu as a separate entity - it 's pretty irrelevant as the eu does n't really have a foreign policy , so to speak . 
   if it does have influence its minuscule . 
  sorry mate but that 's hilarious , especially coming from a british person . 
  they did drag you into the stupidest war ever , something apparently everybody except tony blair saw coming . 
  more than the obvious ww2 , the munich agreements . 
  fuck chamberlain and daladier for those . 
  in 1938 , if we 'd taken a stand we could have steamrolled all the way to berlin without too much of a problem . 
  daladier was also one cynical fuck , he knew that the agreements were a disaster ( when he came back to paris there were crowds greeting him happily because they thought that he had secured peace , and he was thinking `` what a load of idiots '' the whole time ) . 
  orwell had a great essay about that . 
  basically saying that nazism had to be destroyed but there was no way the west could claim moral superiority over the nazis . 
  edit : it 's in one of his collected essays , i 'll check back on them sometime and post the title . 
  pierre laval is a much bigger traitor . 
  he was definitely the bigger collaborator , and held more power than p\u00e9tain after 1942 . 
  also he did that speech where he said that he hoped for germany 's victory . 
  p\u00e9tain hated him too . 
  i prefer [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mxqmkvy.jpg?1 ) version though !, 
  `` teh yuropoors only have healthcare and shit because we pay for it by nato !!!!, 
  yeah , i do n't remember where i saw this . 
  btw , the `` only thing '' ?
