  [ really ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_solferino ) :(, 
  country : china . 
  we were the first country to recognise the prc and we did n't really capitalise on that sort of thing , that can generate a lot of goodwill . 
  and we kinda sorta wasted it by grandstanding for the 2008 olympics . 
  it 's , incidentally , a massive market with an emerging upper middle class that can see some luxury french products as status symbols . 
  we also have a sizeable chinese minority . 
  it worries the eastern europeans because of russia , obviously . 
  does n't worry me as much because we do n't need the usa for defense . 
   what does the ukraine have that america needs ? 
  nothing . 
  what does any european country have that america needs ? 
  nothing . 
  markets . 
  i read on the internet that some people , in other countries , sometimes have `` vacation shame '' or `` vacation guilt '' . 
  that sounds completely insane to me . 
  i also heard that napoleon personally replaced blue with green because he preferred it as a colour . 
  that 's the traditional interpretation but the combination of red , white and blue has been around for a long time before the revolution , you even find it in medieval paintings . 
  another neat story is that we went back to the royalist white flag between 1815 and 1830 , and the 1830 revolution brought back the tricolour . 
  then in the 1848 revolution , a lot of republicans wanted to abandon the tricolour and replace it with the red flag with gold laurels and * libert\u00e9 egalit\u00e9 fraternit\u00e9 * embroidered on it . 
  it was ultimately refused . 
  like i said , the guardian 's opinion pieces are cringeworthy . 
  but i was talking about their investigative journalism , which has a pretty nice record . 
  probably not . 
  as some countries are monarchies , there are n't any pan-european rules about it . 
  depends from country to country , it boils down to every country 's constitution . 
  in some countries it 's a requirement , in others , such a law would be anticonstitutional ( i believe that 's the case in france ) . 
  british people - how do you even put up with your media ? 
  how can the daily mail be the most read newspaper ? 
  how can the daily star exist ? 
  or itv , for that matter ? 
  why does * anybody * take them seriously ? 
  it 's baffling , especially when you also have the bbc which is still really good , and other good publications like the economist , and the guardian 's investigative reporting ( not so much their opinion pieces ) . 
  edit : i quoted those three because those are the ones i read . 
  but i 'll add that the financial times , the telegraph are very good publications too , whereas the left-wing daily mirror is trash . 
  my point is how can a country with such prestigious and excellent media also have such rags . 
  the last one was ... excellent . 
  this year 's was pretty good and the song was among the favourites , but the stage performance was bad so it did n't win . 
  still , it was in the top 10 . 
  some years back we sent a corsican singer who had a fantastic voie , but because he did n't sing in english or his lyrics were n't about a ) russia or b ) love and peace , he went down . 
  the eruption of the volcano laki in iceland in 1783 . 
  its eruption caused a massive drop in worldwide temperatures , causing big crop failures all over europe , and the winter of 1783-1784 was extremely harsh . 
  this , along with other extreme weather events , contributed to rising poverty and even famine , all important factors that would lead to the french revolution in 1789 . 
   our woman should stay in a kitchen and prepare something interesting for their man . 
  you mean , like they actually did until relatively recently ? 
  it 's not really arrogance , though , is it ? 
  it 's common sense . 
  individuals have friends . 
  countries are not just the sum total of individuals , but also represent a higher , common interest of those people . 
  they 're impersonal , in a way . 
  and the prime goal of each country is to ensure the survival and prosperity of its people . 
  in the realm of international relations ( excluding stuff like disaster relief for example ) , no country ever did anything out of kindness , but because there was something in it for them , anything else is just pr . 
  yeah , that 's it !, 
  charles de gaulle said that , but he was n't the first , lord palmerston expressed the same sentiment . 
   i say that it is a narrow policy to suppose that this country or that is to be marked out as the eternal ally or the perpetual enemy of england . 
  we have no eternal allies , and we have no perpetual enemies . 
  our interests are eternal and perpetual , and those interests it is our duty to follow ... 
  we asked him to say that france was the uk 's closest ally and he did it , the absolute madman !, 
  it 's talked about at every single rugby game haha . 
  ** belgium : ** we make fun of them but in the end there 's a lot of love . 
  the beer is amazing , the people are super friendly . 
  ** spain : ** great food , weather , and teh wimminz . 
  also generally a more laid back attitude !, 
  ** italy : ** our bros , rivalry and all . 
  they gave us art and we helped them exist , heh . 
  ** switzerland : ** chocolate , i guess ? 
  also the cities are clean . 
  ** germany : ** i have some admiration for their efficiency , straightforwardness , and envious of the * mittelstand * . 
  also the country of philosophy . 
  our closest ally politically , it 's going to be fun ruling europe without those pesky brits . 
  antoine griezmann sends his regards though . 
  ** uk : ** entertainment !, 
  i 'm a big fan of british tv shows , the actors are amazing , and the music is great . 
  i like the humour as well . 
  i spent a year and a half in london and loved it . 
  ** luxemburg : ** erm , hi there . 
  ** brazil ( hey , it counts ) : ** what 's not to like ? 
  also we love playing football against you guys . 
  well , miralem pjanic is a fabulous player . 
  nudity in advertising , films and all sorts of media is still much more accepted than in the usa . 
  a recent example was that the 50 shades of grey film was rated pretty mildly in france ( 12 years minimum ) , which was a dividing issue in the censorship board because part of them wanted no age limitation at all . 
  also , and i realise this happens only in certain states in the usa , but we do n't really have junk like `` abstinence-only '' sex ed , or `` virgin pledges '' or whatever . 
  in fact female contraception is fully covered by social security . 
  so much history . 
  not to mention the `` graveyard of empires '' . 
  uzbekistan as well . 
  i 've always wanted to see samarkand , bukhara , tashkent ... 
  funny that today these places are under most people 's radar , but there was a time when they were the crossroads of the world , not to mention the cradle of many empires . 
  from russia 's point of view , geopolitics as others here have well explained . 
  from those parties ' point of view , putin 's russia is a model : traditional values enforced , fighting western decadence ( teh gayz will prevert our childrens !! 1 ! ) . 
  also right-wing populism has a hard-on for strongmen , so they admire putin . 
  beautiful city with tons of history , a huge centre for fine cuisine and much more pleasant than paris . 
  le vent l'emportera is the most stereotypically french song ever . 
  well , yeah , i mean , it 's completely baffling to me that anybody would expect a politician to resign because he had an affair or fucked a prostitute or had a handjob by a clown while wearing sponge bob underwear on his head . 
  i think for most french people that 's the same feeling . 
  unless it 's illegal , of course ( rape , underage prostitution , harassment ) . 
  the other thing that 's not always much liked is if a politician has all his private life out in the open . 
  sarkozy 's divorce and remarriage and hollande 's affairs with s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royal , julie gayet and val\u00e9rie trierweiler were played out in the open and that was n't appreciated . 
  `` if you want to have 30 mistresses , by all means , do it , just do n't bother us about it '' is the general gist . 
  which is why politicians ' private lives have always been a no-go zone for the press ( helped by very strong privacy laws ) .
