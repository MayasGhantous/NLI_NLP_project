  some parts of the french countryside manage to survive in a lot of regions because of some sort of protectionnism ( aoc , aop ... ) but few people can make a living out of these activities . 
  these regions really only survive from massive transfers from the very productive part of the country ( who is actually very competitive by european standards ) . 
  also , population density is roughly half of germany in metropolitan france . 
  [ and population is a lot more concentrated in a few places in france than it is in germany ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5i6dbd/population_density_in_france_and_germany_2011/ ) so it 's pretty difficult to maintain a decent level of public infrastructures for so few people ... 
  so these small villages are pretty much left to rot , and progressively tend to only be populated by old people that are not generating a lot of economic activity ( essentially going to the local supermarket to spend their pensions ) . 
  it 's a vicious circle and we ca n't unfortunately do much to solve the problem imho . 
  first days of ww1 . 
  the sheer sadness of young peasants that barely got outside their villages being thrown into the meatgrinder the very first days of a very long war while they were said that the next war would be glorious since they were a child always gets me . 
  3rd republic era . 
  i romanticize this period a lot .

  the help france gave to the usa during the war of independence . 
  even if it was one of multiple wars between france and the uk , it kickstarted a unique country that became the biggest power in the world by far . 
  apart from the obvious conflictual point ( well , we consider alsace to be part of the french region because of the rhine ) ... 
  i think putting romania as a whole in the balkan region is a bit too much . 
  they share a lot of common history with balkanic countries but they also share a lot with hungary ( arguably more ) too . 
  i 'd have put it with the v4 , putting some orange traits with regions that are more historically linked with the balkanic region . 
  i think british isles is a distinct region , putting it with france is not very instinctive for me . 
  especially ireland . 
  there is an italian-speaking canton in switzerland . 
  finland should be light blue and estonia should have light blue traits imho . 
  else it seems about right for me . 
  guess you wanted to say one country ? 
  by definition , europe can not be a nation since the european continent is populated by multiple nationalities . 
  well , few issues that seem important for me : - the concept of nation-state is very strong in europe . 
  i 'd even say cherished . 
  - different political traditions . 
  french are n't as economically liberal than most in europe for example . 
  germans are n't as conservative as poles ... - problems regarding the lingua franca in the european state . 
  english is not a neutral language at all , and many french people do n't have any knowledge in english for example . 
  it would be a bureaucratic mess to be forced to translate everything . 
  - problems regarding solidarity between the different federal states . 
  a lot of people would not be inclined to help someone that is not perceived as their equals . 
  imho it would weaken the peripherical regions even more than in our current system . 
  ( since the money would be less equally distributed inside the european territory ) - we have a model that ensures peace between our countries . 
  we risk more conflicts if we 're uniting . 
  - huge risk that some nations would be overrepresented in the country . 
  in a 1 state = 1 vote system , smaller nations would be far too powerful but a 1 person = 1 vote system would result in bigger nations being too powerful . 
  - the parliament would be filled with regionalist parties that are generally more concerned about their own interests rather than the interest of the country as a whole . 
  it does n't have a widespread coverage . 
  if you want to learn something about it though , it 's not very difficult to find what you want . 
  you have to be careful about what you read though , since it is often biased towards one camp . 
  to be fair the syrian conflict had a pretty small coverage before the attacks . 
  we heard about it when it began in 2011 , when hollande wanted to intervene against bashar al-assad in 2013 and then not much . 
  also , we get nearly no coverage about ukrainian conflict which is something far more concerning for europe than a proxy war between iran and sa .

  lovely city , big enough to have some activities inside the city , pretty rich , not so far from the sea and mountains , good climate ( except maybe during heatwaves ) , good cuisine , one of the best french cities outside paris when it comes to education ... 
  french doctors are only a little part of the population . 
  it was the 60s-70s doctors that prescribed a ton of antibiotics . 
  then the population thought it was a good thing to be prescribed antibiotics for anything . 
  when i was a child , my mother - who is a pharmacian - always took antibiotics when she was a little sick , so i can confirm it was cultural . 
  french are not totally guilty of this , though . 
  doctors prescribed a looot of antibiotics in the past .

  tragic, 
  if your problem is not seen as critical you generally have to wait 1 or 2 months to see a specialist . 
  in this situation specialty matters a lot . 
  but if you really wish it , you can generally find a specialist that will take you earlier than most . 
  if your issue is serious though you will not wait for a long time , no matter the specialty . 
  the chocolatine vs pain au chocolat war . 
  butter vs olive oil duck vs no duck in cuisine southern accent vs parisian accent vs `` north '' accent ( but it 's not that common ) caf\u00e9 culture in some southern parts of the country that is pretty much inexistant elsewhere . 
  p\u00e9tanque vs ... well ... nothing . 
  vend\u00e9e ( historically the last bastion of hardline catholicism ) vs france ( not really religious in general ) . 
  rugby vs football/soccer some strong regional/national identities ( bretons , basque , corsicans ) , some less prevalent ( alsacians , savoyards , catalans ) . 
  politically ... western france is generally left-wing while eastern france is generally right-wing . 
  paris is generally following the national trend ( or paris * is * the national trend depending on your point of view ) . 
  it 's not an absolute truth though . 
  fn has a north-south divide . 
  southern branch is far more economically liberal ( and arguably more racist ) . 
  paris vs `` la province '' . 
  there are real differences , but they are n't fundamental ( and mostly comes down to the differences between big cities and small cities ) . 
  but the rivalry continue because no one likes to be called a parisian or a provincial i guess . 
  climate differences . 
  ( slightly ) colder spain in the south , alpine climate in central and alpine france , continental climate in northeastern france , humid and mild near the atlantic coast , pretty much northern england in northern france ...

  i guess it 's because you 're speaking english . 
  since everything on reddit is in english ( and as such `` popular '' content is already accessible in your native language ) , your sub was at birth condemned to be a news subreddit . 
  other national subs are essentially every default subs packed in the same one , only with a different language .

  what is shown in the movie is not ratatouille . 
  it 's a [ confit byaldi ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/confit_byaldi ) . 
  if it was ratatouille absolutely no french would cook it on a regular basis since it is far from being an easy recipe . 
  ratatouille looks like [ this ] ( http://assets.marthastewart.com/styles/wmax-1500/d21/ratatouille-med106010/ratatouille-med106010_0_horiz.jpg?itok=xzi5jm_u ) . 
  and it tastes better in my opinion . 
  they 're oddly seen as an elitist thing in france . 
  hipster , sorta . 
  my own cliche of regular comics readers is people thirty-something with a well payed job . 
  may have a lot to do with the high price of comics . 
  also the fact that french speaking comics ( les bd ) are also a big thing . 
  but mangas are wildly popular here , guess it 's because there are much more differences . 
  i 'd prefer a soft brexit , of course . 
  but europe must be careful if it chose this option . 
  soft brexit is the same thing as giving special treatment to switzerland and norway , prosperous countries living outside the eu but with the trade privileges . 
  it gives an incentive for other prosperous european countries to leave the project . 
  it this precedent is set , it could be the end of the eu as a whole on the long term . 
  and i guess also the end of the fabulous trade agreements . 
  so , i might prefer a `` hard brexit '' , i find it less risky for europe as a whole .
