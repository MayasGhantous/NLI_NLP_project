i 'm assuming you 're on mobile but the guy you 're replying to also has a netherlands flair , it 's pretty funny . 
  euronews broadcasts in 14 languages . 
  now i understand you 'd like it better if we all chose english as our god and saviour , but some europeans still enjoy being able to watch things in their own languages . 
  that improved the quality and prices of rail travel so much in the uk !, 
  knowing french citizenship administration , what they are wondering is if she wants to make her life in france or just enjoy the benefits coming with the status . 
  i know this sounds bad but , especially in this time of crisis , civil servants are forced to select further than the ( vague ) guidelines . 
  is she currently studying in the uk ? 
  ( and how would being french save her money then ? ), 
  that along with the fact she does not have any family in the country indicate to the citizenship officer she just wants the benefits and is not particularly interested in living in france . 
  she may fit all the guidelines but not living in france is a big no-no . 
  i understand the money issues but she has little chance to win her appeal since the decision is discretionary . 
  it makes sense she was refused citizenship if she is not residing in france for long periods of time . 
  naturalisation is not a right and in spite of existing guidelines , the decision is discretionary . 
  the person must have resided in france for the last 5 years except in special cases ( 2 years of study for a french degree , exceptional qualities , serving in the french army etc. ) . 
  having a job is an important factor , as is knowledge of french and french values . 
  she can look up [ this website ] ( http://www.droitissimo.com/etrangers/naturalisation-nationalite-francaise/comment-contester-refus-d-accorder-nationalite-francaise-refus-naturalisation ) for details on how to appeal but she should probably wait and reapply later instead , when she gets a job and has 5 years residence . 
  also not to pressure you but if you 're a swede she could get eu citizenship by marriage  edit : also try xposting to / r/france, 
  except this justification stopped making sense when we started chlorination of water . 
  the disease has all but disappeared in developed countries , including france . 
  these trade barriers are unfair coming from the supposed champion of capitalism . 
  that being said , coming from someone currently living in wisconsin , the us has some great cheese too . 
  cheese made from young raw milk ( which includes many french cheeses ) is illegal in the us . 
  the `` french '' cheese you buy , such as brie , often is a pasteurized version made in the us . 
  seeing you austrians deal with the mountains of snow you got these past few weeks has really been tons of fun . 
  it opened my eyes to austrian humor !, 
  hey , where is that ? 
  i feel like i know the place but ca n't tell for sure . 
  have fun in your 20 sq. 
  m. 200,000 euros studio !, 
  hollande is not amazing , and i 'm saying that as someone who voted for him , but sarkozy is downright evil . 
  also , if you think we do n't have a choice , just see what the us or the uk have to offer in terms of variety ( even though i feel like it 's changing in the uk ) . 
  and yes , fringe parties have lots of power , if only at the local level . 
  i agree with you though that our politicians are pathetic and not up to the task . 
  but that 's because politics are becoming more and more motivated by the search for power and class interests instead of real beliefs and convictions . 
  this is a good idea , but following which orientation ? 
  germany has been very reluctant to get involved in any type of foreign policy and is traditionally very dogmatic on issues such as israel . 
  in general , every country has specific issues they care about . 
  i 'm sorry , what makes you say everyone in france thinks rroma are scum ? 
  while there have been violences , both from regular citizens and politicians , there is no generalized racist consensus on them . 
  if anything , the french society is very divided on the issue . 
  for example when the eu condemned sarkozy 's government for its anti-rroma policy , two contradictory polls came out . 
  one said 56 % of the population approved ( [ french link ] ( http://www.letelegramme.com/ig/generales/france-monde/france/sondage-sur-les-roms-56-des-francais-donnent-raison-a-l-europe-18-09-2010-1054559.php ) ) , another that 56 % ( sic ) disapproved ( [ french link ] ( http://www.letelegramme.com/ig/generales/france-monde/france/sondage-56-des-francais-desapprouvent-la-commission-europeenne-16-09-2010-1052307.php ) ) of the action . 
  racial polls are forbidden in france , but i think a poll like that gives a good idea of how divided the french population is on this issue . 
  one thing on which there is a consensus is the dismantling of illegal camps . 
  80 % of the sample ( [ french link ] ( http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/80-francais-favorables-demantelement-camps-illegaux-roms-mais-73-jugent-mesure-inefficace-sondage-ifop-449314.html ) ) agree with it . 
  i personally do too , as these camps are often located on private grounds or in city centers with terrible sanitary conditions . 
  this was right in the center of my hometown , by a historical monument : [ 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/msskkjz.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ig7u4bp.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4uz7imc.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/crygvnr.jpg ) , [ story & video on this camp , in french ] ( http://provence-alpes.france3.fr/info/marseille-le-cloaque-de-la-porte-d-aix-69896345.html ) . 
  you can disagree on the methods used to remove them ( i sure do ) but i do n't think anyone would want this kind of settlement in their city . 
  there were measles and tuberculosis in this camp !, 
  it basically condemned the whole area , forced businesses to close and gave the neighbourhood a terrible reputation . 
  anyway , my point was to show the french opinion is not so united in hatred and a lot of the resentment comes from having these kind of huge unsafe settlements right in your face . 
  this has nothing to do with europe . 
  when are you getting banned ? 
  i think it 's * only * used for women , or at least i never heard it about a man . 
  ok , even if i agreed that you were victim of a crusade and a series of misunderstandings , could you please reply to my other questions ? 
  i 'd like to know what your interests in europe are , given that you seem to be american . 
  also i personally would n't consider you posting so much a badge of honor ( or efficiency ) , but to each their own . 
  do n't be like that . 
  i could say the same thing about no mod being french . 
  nationality should at least be * considered * instead of choosing more british mods and an american guy with a questionable record . 
  i 'm worried by your nomination as a mod because of your actions in / r/canada . 
  you were removed as mod after very questionable choices , including banning a number of subscribers for no valid reasons . 
  you also deleted posts discussing the bans . 
  you also apparently use alt accounts , which does not really make you accountable . 
  a vote was held on / r/canada to know whether or not you should stay as a mod , and ** almost noone voted in your favor ** ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/wvhks/the_mods_say_we_should_vote_on_whether_or_not_we/ ) ) . 
  i 'm also wondering what the hell you 're doing in / r/europe . 
  are you european ? 
  what 's your interest in europe ? 
  do you comment in this subreddit ? 
  do you think you 'll be a good mod when you 're already moderating so many huge communities ? 
  i 'm sorry if i seem cold but you do have a questionable record and this subreddit already has enough problems on its own . 
  the first sites you get when you make a search on this issue are very partisan sites , including stormfront . 
  i would like to see a press source on this . 
  you are right , i deleted my previous comment, 
  he was ignorant on economic facts , but he was mostly incredibly rude and insulting not only towards our government but also towards french * employees . 
  to be honest he sounds like a real piece of shit . 
  yes !, 
  after living in the us for a while , i feel like there are much more different accents in my country ( france ) than in america . 
  to add on what 's been said before , you also benefit from the visa-waiving agreements of both countries , which is convenient when traveling . 
  even our most dedicated troll / u/ufrustratedbro sometimes makes worthwhile comments . 
  more like 6th or eighth depending on the sources . 
  you 're always talking about french going to the uk , but a ton of rich retired brits are living in southwestern france . 
  the dordogne region has basically become gray-haired british everywhere . 
  the truth of it is that fiscal evasion is a marginal phenomenon . 
  or this by / u/rexxo `` it 's not about religion , it 's about being a dumb , superstitious ** nigger ** . '', 
  thing is even when you report these comments noone ever seems to get banned . 
  edit : this one by / u/blackplaguecurer ( nice handle ) is great too `` that 's what you get for allowing ** nigger savages ** in your country . 
  i , for one , am proud that these ** animals ** will never find a place in finland . 
  sure , the government 's trying hard to let in as many ** monkeys ** as it can , but we finns will give them hell and they 'll ultimately just move to a more tolerant country like sweden and netherlands . '', 
  edit 2 : this by / u/lepringlesface , who , by the way , is being upvoted `` because they thought she was a witch man , this better not be ** niggers ** again congo yap , ** niggers ** . 
  seriously . 
  why do n't you just throw them out already ? '', 
  edit 3 : this kind of sensationalist `` news `` does n't have much to do on the frontpage of this subreddit . 
  the op is a new account created just to post racist comments . 
  this sub has a history of being invaded by racist channers or extremist subs and we should really have a zero-tolerance policy on racism . 
  i 'm sorry , but your comment shows a complete lack of knowledge of european culture and housing market at best . 
  renting is incredibly expensive in europe , and entry-level employment opportunities are hard to get . 
  owners ask for a crazy amount of guarantees to rent , often a long-term job , plus the backing of at least two other people and large security deposits . 
  besides , if you looked at the map , you would have noticed this is mostly cultural . 
  poland is certainly not a nanny state , far from it .
