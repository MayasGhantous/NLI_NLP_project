  its economic liberalism is inspired by the us actually . 
  in italy , there has always been a culture of living with your parents for a long time . 
  there is even a word for guys who stay with their family late in their 20s/early 30s ( [ mammoni ] ( http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/mammone/ ) ) . 
  france is a strong providence state but the rate is relatively low . 
  the nordic countries have very low rates too . 
  i could keep going . 
  anyway , sorry if i 'm a little more rude than the dane , but you seem to be talking out of your ass . 
  bffs \u2665 \u2665 \u2665, 
  we all like you in the end . 
  and this is coming from a frenchman . 
  beer beer ? 
  wow , first time i see one of you guys in here !, 
  lots of americans in / r/france too . 
  about half the posts are in english . 
  not that i 'm complaining , but i hope we can keep speaking french too !, 
  oh , believe me , j' en ai marre too !, 
  if only he just stopped taunting for a minute , now he 's just encouraging other rich dumbasses to speak up , and people are actually getting worried . 
  the russian is not amused !, 
  it 's also used in southeastern france , at least . 
  gadjo means a guy and gadji a girl . 
  nothing for france ? 
  i guess i have to do it then . 
  obviously it 's entirely subjective and does not even begin to cover everything . 
  i start at the enlightenment because if i do n't it will never end . 
  * [ candide ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/candide ) , by voltaire ( 1759 ) . 
  i guess you could pick any philosophical novel , but this is probably the funniest and the most famous . 
  it 's a great example of enlightenment philosophy too . 
  stendhal is certainly one of the first who really developed his characters ' psychology . 
  also pokes great fun at the bourbon monarchy . 
  * [ les mis\u00e9rables ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/les_mis%c3%a9rables ) by victor hugo ( 1862 ) . 
  obviously incredibly important in french literature and society . 
  a book about the lower classes for the lower classes . 
  the recent movie is an utter disgrace though . 
  * [ twenty thousand leagues under the sea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty_thousand_leagues_under_the_sea ) by jules verne ( 1870 ) is one of the first popular science fiction books . 
  verne wrote a ton of books but this is my favorite . 
  it 's often framed as children literature , but i 'd argue it 's actually really well written with a meaningful subtext . 
  during the 20th century , i 'd say * [ in search of lost time ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_search_of_lost_time ) by proust ( 1912 - 27 ) . 
  it took me years to read it , honestly , but what a shock when you manage to do so . 
  i think we 're still underestimating proust 's impact on world literature . 
  * [ journey to the end of night ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/journey_to_the_end_of_the_night ) by c\u00e9line ( 1932 ) is an incredible reading experience . 
  also a great portrayal of post-war colonial france . 
  really makes you want to puke at times , it stays with you for a long time . 
  * [ nausea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nausea_ ( novel \\ ) ) by jean-paul sartre ( 1938 ) tells you everything you want to know about existentialism in one novel . 
  for more fun , read sartre 's autobiography and reflexions on literature , [ the words ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_words_ ( book \\ ) ) ( 1963 ) . 
  * [ the stranger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_stranger_ ( novel \\ ) ) by albert camus ( 1942 ) . 
  if you have n't read it , do so . 
  only takes a few hours , changes your world . 
  * [ froth on the daydream ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/froth_on_the_daydream ) by boris vian ( 1947 ) is a great love story , very sad ( it 's french ... ) but also surrealist and very fun . 
  it 's certainly harder to compile something for recent years ... 
  this is where it becomes very subjective . 
  i 'd say marguerite yourcenar , eug\u00e8ne ionesco , julien gracq , saint-john perse and fran\u00e7ois mauriac are really important . 
  in living authors , marie ndiaye certainly has something . 
  le cl\u00e9zio got the nobel but i do n't really like him that much . 
  michel houellebecq is hit or miss , and for me it 's always been miss . 
  i like jonathan littell , who is french-american and writes in french . 
  yasmina khadra certainly wrote some good stuff . 
  it 's really too much , sorry !, 
  oh , and i only mentioned fiction . 
  here are three nonfiction books that changed a ton of things , check them out : * pascal 's [ pens\u00e9es ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pens%c3%a9es ) ( 1669 ) . 
  * [ the social contract ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the social contract ) by rousseau ( 1762 ) . 
  there is a before and an after the social contract . 
  really changed the way we think about society , politics , etc. 
  * [ the code civil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/code_civil ) ( 1804 ) . 
  and napol\u00e9on gave us the law . 
  huge influence all over europe ( except in britain , but you know how they are . . ), 
  yeah , it smells like play-dough . 
  really weird but not that unpleasant . 
  there is a limit to the number of characters you can have in the css stylesheet of a subreddit . 
  most people i 've spoken to are not amused . 
  pretty pissed even . 
  not mentioning his recent taunting about it . 
  did you know their president is a woman and received the [ nobel peace prize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ellen_johnson_sirleaf ) ? 
  is france a recipient country now ? 
  haha no it is late too . 
  production should start in 2017 and it is going to cost 8.5 billion $ instead of 3.3 . 
  it is really cool technology but the realization is just disastrous . 
  yes the media just mentions it as the `` epr reactors '' , probably because they ca n't pronounce olkiluoto . 
  and to be honest we 're more concerned about the same reactor being built in france . 
  we do ? 
  i had never heard of the thing until now . 
  the thing is food is necessary to a human 's survival . 
  and once a farm goes bankrupt , it is very hard to get it to produce again . 
  the land usually goes to the wilderness or to private property owners . 
  throughout france , tons of former farms are being sold as country houses to rich or retired people . 
  when you lose a farm , you also lose a lot of practical knowledge that is hard to get back . 
  agriculture is something that 's not adapted to a market economy , if you do n't have a strong agriculture before a crisis ( war , natural disaster , etc. 
  ) , you 're not going to be able to build one fast and it 's going to cost you a lot in the way of human lives . 
  agriculture is economically important in france . 
  we are the second biggest exporter worlwide . 
  we have a lot of powerful agrobusinesses / food companies . 
  even letting this aside , agriculture is strategically important . 
  every somewhat large country subsidizes the agriculture massively as a safety net in case of a strategic emergency . 
  the strategic benefits do not only concern france but we could wager they extend to most of the european union . 
  we need more integration in agricultural policy for everyone to feel the benefits . 
  also we have to remember the amount dedicated to the cap ( 44 % ! ), 
  seems huge because the european budget is minuscule . 
  we should move forward by expanding new projects and giving these projects the means to work , not by destroying what already exists and serves its purpose . 
  this is true for all developed countries when compared to less developed ones . 
  even in asia , you bet travelling in laos will be les expensive than in japan .
