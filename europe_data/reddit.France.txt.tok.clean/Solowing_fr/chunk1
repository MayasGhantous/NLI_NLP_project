* baguette intensifies *, 
  still waiting !, 
  the figures are actually more dramatic if you only take into account natives ' fertility rate . 
  why is erdoganistan part of europe ? 
  funnily enough , he asked to turks in europe to make 4/5 kids when half of his country has a fertylity rate < 2.1 . 
  as my economics professor used to say , the more you learn about the eu , the more you want to leave it . 
  shhh , do n't interrupt his wishful thinking !, 
  he also thinks that `` there 's too many white people '' ( in brest , his native town ) ( https://www.valeursactuelles.com/politique/quand-hamon-trouvait-quil-y-avait-trop-de-blancs-brest-62325 ) hamon is a self-loathing spineless dimwit . 
  and his candidacy speaks volumes about the left nowadays . 
  you would n't be saying that if you went to berlin ... 
   this kind of sociopathic behavior is a natural result of our ~ ~ economic system ~ ~ human nature ftfy, 
  yesterday around 7 pm on france 3 ( public local channel ) . 
  this story was on french tv so yeah . 
  also , he has 2 hands and 2 legs . 
  probably an ableist scum . 
  and milk . 
  ... except luxembourg is a tax-haven and [ the european capital of money laundering ] ( https://www.wort.lu/en/business/basel-institute-on-governance-luxembourg-performs-poorly-in-anti-money-laundering-index-55d9ec500c88b46a8ce5ecdb ) increasing its wealth only at the expense of the rest of europe . 
  you do n't have the moral high ground , buddy . 
  keep your head buried in the sand . 
  nothing to see . 
  it 's not like they have the choice anyway . 
  except if we consider the sinai peninsula as a viable alternative . 
  das right !, 
  das right !, 
  this chart is so stupid . 
  the truth is that trust in any of these institutions is probably close to an historic low . 
  he probably meant overseas ... or he pulled out a macron and decided to consider the french population living there as expats !, 
  it 's considered as a ** normative ** theory for a reason i guess ... 
  my `` in layman 's terms '' was refering to the mathematical derivation provided in the link . 
  market freedom is actually called perfect competition in economics literature and is defined by 5 main conditions , namely : * 1 ) ** market atomicty ** : a large number of consumers/producers with the willingness and ability to buy/supply the product at a certain price . 
  so that any actor on that said market is a ** price taker ** ( in lieu of a price maker that can control the market price of his product ) ; * 2 ) ** product homogeneity ** : all firms sell an identical product ; * 3 ) ** no barriers to entry or exit ** * 4 ) ** perfect factor ( capital and labour ) mobility ** * 5 ) ** perfect information ** ( no asymetry of information ) : buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm . 
  but that 's just the neoclassical view of the working of market economies and as you can see it 's rather idealistic . 
  economists from the austrian school give a much narrowed and realistic definition . 
  yours is pretty close to murray rothbard 's view on competition for example . 
  ph.d student in financial macroeconomics here . 
  it 's not that simple ( cf. 
  [ marshall -- lerner condition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall%e2%80%93lerner_condition ) ) in layman 's terms , the british pound ** devaluation ** - not depreciation , explanation [ here ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/355/trade/devaluation-and-depreciation-definition/ ) - will cause a balance of trade improvement if the absolute sum of the long-term export and import demand elasticities is greater than unity . 
  what has darwin to do with that ? 
  nothing , just your casual xenophobia from the vastly intellectualy superior and progressive scandinavians . 
  or france ... oh wait !, 
  funny how the report avoid the french case ( strict drug policy , 2nd lowest drug deaths in europe ) ... 
  tbf , the law of jante can just be applied to describe a large swathe ( hint : leaning on the left ) of french society . 
  not something one can be proud of ... 
  yd = y * ( 1-t ) , where yd represents a household 's disposable income , y its income and t taxes . 
  they 're getting richer because they 're getting cheaper labor force . 
  not sure if trolling or simply retarded . 
  death penalty may be even older than prostitution . 
  your ability to blame everything on the us is mind-numbing . 
  one is a successful multirole fighter , the other needs tornados for ground-strike missions . 
  where is the eye of sauron version of it ? 
  nice whataboutism . 
   j'accuse . . !, 
  ftfy . 
  til that after +100 million deaths , calling communists `` arrogant and violent '' is generalizing . 
  germany and fascism , a match made in heaven . 
  fair enough . 
  i thought your initial post was implying that agnosticism is much closer to atheism ( instead of a spectrum of views ) . 
  ironically enough , your link also refers to [ agnostic theism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agnostic_theism ) in its 3rd paragraph ... 
  no it is not . 
  as an agnostic , i refuse to hold a dogmatic view by asserting that god does or does not exist . 
  atheists can be just as narrow-minded as zealots . 
  are you serious or is it some kind of sarcasm ? 
  considering that no french soldier has set foot in libya , it makes it kind of hard for them to die there . 
  as for our `` mayfly intervention force '' , being the only country outside of the united states to have a proper nuclear-powered carrier , the only nuclear power in ue , etc. , i 'm fine with it . 
  i think you are mixing up different things . 
  international coalitions ( afghanistan , kosovo , etc. ), 
  can not be seriously compared to a unified european army . 
  as for africa , france may have strong political and economical interest in some regions that urges us to help local governments fight common enemies ( aqmi , boko haram , ... ) . 
  so if a french soldier dies during an obscur mission somewhere in niger , namibia or gabon and you ask me `` where does la patrie fit in that ? '', 
  i 'll reply to you in securing the supply of a critical natural resource ( in this case uranium ) considering our country 's strong reliance on nuclear energy . 
  my father-in-law , who used to be instructor at the sms of saint-cyr ( one of the finest military academy ) , chuckled after reading this article . 
  and rightfully so . 
  you are seriously mistaken if you think that a french soldier would die for anything other than for la patrie . 
  and i firmly believe this mindset is not specific to the french army ... 
  antivirus in 2017 , lul . 
  support for royalists is indeed growing in france , not surprising considering how clueless politicians are . 
  erdogan be like : i do n't know shit about chemistry or about any subject for that matter but neither do my fanbase . 
  yeah so that they can be taxed into oblivion and our bureaucracy drive them crazy . 
  i think they 'd rater stay in north america . 
  2edgy4me !, 
  most people conflate mujahideens and talibans , very disturbing . 
  that 's 10 years too young . 
  - macron, 
  that would be a pretty good move that can benefit to each side so expect our retarded unionists to opposite it . 
  how deluded one can be ... 
  because they are not arabs , they are amazigh ( kabyle , chaoui , etc , the indigenous population of na ) . 
  [ only 4 % of tunisians are of arab descent for example ] ( https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/reference-populations-next-gen/ ) and that is the most arabized countrie of the three ( algerie and morocco ) . 
  they use the [ one-drop rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-drop_rule ) ( how ironic ... ) . 
  he 'd be dead shot three times in the back if he really had something to offer ... 
  keep dreaming ... 
  when a wise man points at the moon the imbecile examines the finger ... 
  the map literally shows you hundreds of muslim raids from north africa to south-east of france vs a dozen of crusade battles . 
  `` muhh crusades , muhh feelings '' . 
  here 's the truth ( assuming you 're merely interested in knowing facts ) : https://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/934184truthoncrusades.jpg, 
  i should feel bad for laughing at this ... 
  well , a couple , a couple . 
  * he located [ villeurbanne near lille ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/dir/lille/69100+villeurbanne/@47.4291925,2.7492951,6.5z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c2d579b3256e11:0x40af13e81646360!2m2!1d3.057256!2d50.62925!1m5!1m1!1s0x47f4c02fcd7623af:0xc3ba0c2b255b2652!2m2!1d4.8901709!2d45.771944?hl=en ) * he called [ guiana ] ( http://d2z7bzwflv7old.cloudfront.net/cdn_image/exw_1200/images/maps/en/fg/fg-area.gif ) an `` island '' * he called `` expats '' french living in [ guadeloupe ] ( http://admin.xpatnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/france-overseas-territories.jpg ) . 
  as a french , i 'd not make fun on any other president geographical skills ... what a time to be alive !, 
  what about saudi arabia ? 
  uae ?
