  indonesia ? 
  you always were more radical than us , do n't deny it !, 
   what do you mean specifically by resentment ? 
  what kind of things did they do/say/not do that causes it ? 
  it depends on your political leaning but among others : overconsumption , crippling public debt , pollution , mass immigration , lack of patriotism and gratitude for the fallen , decay in morals and traditionnal values , weakening of the school and the family education . 
  i see that we share the same view on the topic . 
  i can definitely feel a lot of resentment towards the 68ers * in france lately , especially among the younger generations . 
  * the wiki page gives their name in french ( soixante-huitaires ) but the most common one is `` soixante-huitards '' or `` 68tards '' . 
  tard is not an actual word in french but i wish it was !, 
  til the greens are run by a bunch of american liberal students in germany !, 
  what a time to be alive :d, 
  ok , alright then . 
  huur durr everyone i do n't like is hitler . 
  til the reason i keep failing in life is because i like women . 
  cry me a river !, 
  lul oh my sweet summer child !, 
  leftists were already rounding up place de la r\u00e9publique chanting `` macron d\u00e9mission ! '', 
  the day after his election . 
  that 's right !, 
  they voted macron on sunday and were already protesting on monday , that 's the french mindset for you ... 
  do you realize my post was meant to be sarcastic ? 
  who the hell makes up his mind after reading a random post on reddit ? 
  your argument is weak by the way . 
  not only my subs do not necessarily reflect my views ( i 've been posting on r/france , heavily left-wing ) but a consistent conservative would n't vote for either one ( i voted fillon 1st round for ex ) . 
  you convinced me to vote . 
  i voted for mlp . 
  here you go : ## [ fertility rates in sub-saharan africa by religion ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/main-factors-driving-population-growth/pf_15-04-02_ch1graphics_fertilityregion640px/ ) muslims | christians | unaffiliated --------- | ---------- | ---------- 5.6 | 4.5 | 4.3, 
  huh ? 
  [ fertility rate by religion  ( http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/pf_15-04-02_projectionsoverview_totalfertility_640px/ ) * muslims 3.1 * christians 2.7 considering that nigeria is basically half muslim half christian , its insane and unsustainable demographic growth can not be blamed on the church only . 
  especially if you factore in the fact that [ in the world ranking by population ( 2017 ) ] ( http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/ ) nigeria is surrounded by other insanely populated countries ( indonesia , pakistan , bangladesh ) where muslims are an overwhelming majority ... 
  african countris logic : i ca n't provide for my 3 kids so let 's make 5 more . 
  as for the udi/lr deal , it will indeed stand for `` les l\u00e9gislatives '' . 
  and ? 
  de gaulle and mitterand had the same stance on this issue . 
  spoken like a true deluded american leftist ... 
  how is acknowledging christians ' contribution equivalent to `` wanting to live in a theocracy '' ?? 
  i do n't see how this is relevant but i 'm agnostic . 
  it just bugs me out as someone whose father ancestors ' live has been ruined by islam and whose country 's most eminent figures were christians to see this kind of self-loathing people trying to deny/delegitimize the contribution of christiannity . 
  lul yeah sure . 
  and next apple 's egm should be about lowering the price of its products . 
  keep believing that . 
  the self-loathing is real with you ... 
  gerrymandering is obviously a parallel issue . 
  but i 'd say that in democracy and regardless of the electoral system , a single political party should not have the power to draw the map at will . 
  anglo-saxon countries for example delegate the task of setting electoral constituency to non-partisan organizations to avoid the issue of gerrymandering . 
  i do n't know which one is the most cringy between the guardian and the independent at this point . 
  shh . 
  this year i 've learnt that the american electoral system is not truly democratic . 
  also the british electoral system is not truly democratic as well . 
  at some point , even austrian and dutch electoral systems were almost considered as not truly democratic . 
  and on the face of it , i guess the french electoral system wo n't be considered as truly democratic if mlp somehow wins . 
  may be democracy is like communism , may be the true version has never been implemented . 
  independent has always been a leftist ~ ~ media ~ ~ propaganda outlet but they 're not even trying to hide it anymore . 
  if `` majority of british voters believe brexit was wrong decision '' , the tories would not be expected at ~ 47 % in the coming general election ( polling averages ) . 
  you 're mixing up historical determinism with linear conception of history . 
  lmao `` drastic reforms to the european institutions '' such as ? 
  shhh , they know better than us the problems we face . 
  here is why : http://christophevieren.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/taux_musulman_par_departement.jpg unemployement rate is also another valid reason . 
  not voting would be the most consistent choice indeed . 
  but seriously i 've seen a lot of sciences po ' ( universities for politics in france ) students fail questions like : what oppose mlp to nda on * choose a topic * ... 
  now watch him vote macron while he despises him and his values . 
  politics are spineless . 
  the political spectrum is not a straight line . 
  a lot of eurosceptics were undecided between mlp and jlm . 
  it depends ... a lot of conservatives ( pro-fillon ) and eurosceptics ( pro-m\u00e9lenchon ) will rather vote mlp than hollande ii . 
  5.6 millions of my fellow citizens are jobless ( 10 % unemployement rate ) 10 millions of my fellow citizens live below the poverty line 250 of my fellow citizens have been murdered by isis scums , 1500 have been injured according to our intelligence services , there is potentially 20,000 to 25,000 radicalized muslims in france , of whom around 1,000 can commit a terrorist attack at any moment education is a travesty thanks to a lunatic minister who swore an oath of loyalty to the king of fucking morocco and whose priority is to teach arab to our kids police officer live under the threat of islamists and antifa scums our judiciary system is a joke thanks to corrupted magistrates/judges who would rather out of political correctness see islamists massacre us than put them in jail . 
  we 're doing so well . 
  when 54 % of the gdp is due to half the country administrating the other half , there is a public sector hypertrophy . 
  seems like germans need some freedom . 
  and here i am in france where it took me even lesser time to vote than to cum . 
  feelsbadman, 
  scholarships have always been raised gradually if i 'm not mistaken . 
  and considering that his government rescinded la bourse du m\u00e9rite ( rewarding the best students with a 1800 euros grant of merit ) , leveled down education , etc. , yeah hollande is a true leftist ... 
  it is completely free if you are eligible ( thus 1 student in 4 was a scholarship holder in 2015 : http://md1.libe.com/photo/868591-bourses-2.jpg?%20class= ) . 
  and you can get up to 666 euros per month on top of that . 
  first of all , you 're mixing up eos ( in french , d\u00e9crets ) with ordinance ( in french , ordonnances ) . 
  secondly , you 're comparing different systems of government and constitutions ... last but not the least , if the constitution vests the pr\u00e9sident with certain powers - in this case , art . 
  13 : the president of the republic shall sign the ordinances and decrees deliberated upon in the council of ministers . 
  he shall make appointments to the civil and military posts of the state . 
  [ ... ] - , how is that authoritarian to use them ? 
  the funny part is perhaps that fran\u00e7ois fillon does not `` intend to govern through executive orders '' ( or ordinances for that matter ) because he can not . 
  art . 
  38 compels the pr\u00e9sident to first introduce a bill before parliament authorizing him to issue ordonnances to implement his program . 
  the bill specifies a ** limited period of time , as well as a topic for the proposed ordonnances ** . 
  if the bill passes in parliament , the french cabinet can issue ordonnances on the given legal matter within the specified time period . 
  the executive must consult the council of state on every ordonnance ; the advice of the council is compulsory but nonbinding . 
  what he intends to do during the 3 first months of his mandate is asking the parliament the authorization to issue ordonnances on 3 topics : fiscality , labour law and national security . 
  he 's liberal economically but socially conservative ... a little bit like merkel . 
  of course loony leftists try to make him out to be the next hitler ( cf. 
  a quick translation : according to the dgsi ( the equivalent of the british security service aka mi5 ) , a picture of an automatic rifle put down on le monde newspaper with fran\u00e7ois fillon on the front-page has been discovered . 
  a handgun and 1.5 kg of tatp ( a primary high explosive ) have also been discovered during the perquisition .

  kudos to the british intelligence services first of all . 
  the two islamist scums were expected to try to assassinate the conservative candidate , fran\u00e7ois fillon . 
  what exactly do you mean by `` excluding le pen '' ? 
  but but but , he said he wants us to be the next venezuela , it shows us he care !, 
  how is that of your business ? 
  ( or anyone 's business for that matter ) you should be able to do whatever you want with the money you have earned . 
  but here is what will happen if a retarded governement decides to implement this retarded policy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laffer_curve, 
  this guy is a complete retard .
