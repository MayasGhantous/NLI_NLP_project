  i mean ... that is hard to argue . 
  huh . 
  i 'm pretty sure i saw the same thing in a / r/worldnews comment just minutes ago . 
  what ? 
  nonsense ; we scheduled the rest day in honour of the [ presidential elections in burundi . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burundian_presidential_election,_2015 ), 
  oh ... oh that was painful to watch . 
  seriously , it would not have taken more than 5 minutes that morning to read up a bit on that . 
  nice dedication there . 
  happy national day , * our canada * . 
  it 's been a hundred years , and they still have n't fixed the roads , you know . 
  so , basically , you can pretty much arrest anyone that has a phone with some music on or an mp3 player ? 
  that sounds really convenient . 
  ooooh but be careful now !, 
  if they 're not careful about this warning , next time we might just send them another one !!!, 
  the downvotes * probably * have something to do with you posting something that is : 1 . 
  completely ignorant of history - everyone knows the us was friendly with groups fighting the government in afghanistan in the 80s , none of which have anything to do with isis , which has only existed for a few years 2 . 
  so unrelated to the current discussion that it boggles the mind how you managed to reach this level of whataboutism, 
  `` keep your hose in order ! '', 
  is n't that a p diddy lyric ? 
  `` i will not buy this tobacconist 's , it is scratched ! '', 
  exactly . 
  that also does n't take into account the importance/scale of the information being removed . 
  there 's a thousand people asking for minor misdemeanors to be removed so it does n't cost them a job interview , but all of them combined do n't have as much impact as , say , a politician trying to remove traces of a scandal he was involved in . 
  i 've never seen protests get this aggressive . 
  usually it 's things like truckers driving as slow as possible on the highway to make everyone late ( and losing the support of 90 % of the population ) , train/metro employees going on strike right as university exams start ( which not only makes them lose the support of 90 % of the population , but also potentially costs thousands of euros for some students that ca n't make it to their exams and have to repeat their year ) , that kind of stuff . 
  really stupid and counter-intuitive because it makes normal people furious at the unions , but at least it 's not violent . 
  on the other hand , there were reports in strasbourg of taxi drivers posing as uber clients , giving them an address in the middle of nowhere to isolate them and then beating the shit out of them away from witnesses . 
  i 'm going to go out of my way to never hire a taxi in france for the rest of my life . 
  oh god , do n't remind me about those dickbags . 
  ca n't believe they actually got uber banned thanks to their bullshit . 
  i guess if i want taxis banned from france i should just start [ throwing cinder blocks at them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1c4fgyovla ) until the government says i 'm in the right . 
  i do n't necessarily feel that 's the case . 
  watching anime is kinda seen as a really nerdy thing to do , but i think it 's mostly a matter of kids ' shows not being as popular as they used to be and kids spending less time in front of the tv and more in front of their computer , where there 's a smaller chance that they 'll be exposed to new stuff . 
  yeah , mangas/animes arrived * en masse * in the 80 's / 90 's on every kids ' show , and got some extra free publicity from parents saying they were too violent and should be banned ( at a time where folks did n't realise saying something was too violent and should be banned basically guarantees it stays on the air for 3 more years ) . 
  today 's teenagers did n't really go through the same thing but i remember naruto being pretty big for years . 
  it goes the other way too , the japanese are * really * into france . 
  to the point where they basically gave birth to [ paris syndrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ) , which is caused by going to paris with huge expectations , only to be massively disappointed when you get there . 
  it 's fun . 
  and it would have been seen by less people , because it was n't a default sub at the time and it had a lot less subscribers . 
  that was so ridiculous . 
  sure , it happened in the us and / r/worldnews is supposed to be for worldwide/out-of-us events , but the story * was * a worldwide one . 
  it was being discussed on every news channel on the planet . 
  a drawing of the eu flag with a sad face drawn on it ? 
  i do n't know . 
  edit : [ something like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/anxnq6y.jpg ), 
  the guy who does [ the editorial cartoons for the onion ] ( http://www.theonion.com/features/editorial-cartoon ) is fantastic at making fun of all those clich\u00e9s . 
  he labels everything , there 's always a crying statue of liberty , it 's hilarious . 
  and they kill people in his name when he is drawn , saying that they avenged him . 
  methinks those extremists might have missed the point ... 
  you can take my freedom , but you can never take my 8-tracks !, 
  it 's really mostly just this guy doing it . 
  no need to pin this on all of us . 
  i kinda like it , honestly . 
  it 's a nice change of pace compared to the rest of reddit . 
  technically it 's a crime in france too . 
  it just so happens that nobody really cares . 
  i mean ... that 's * technically * sex she did n't consent to . 
  http://i.imgur.com/8fxea.gif now you know how we feel , i guess . 
  so what you 're saying is , stay in russia until 30-ish , then move east some more until you get to asia , where women do n't age until they 're 85 ? 
  `` yes , maybe my brother died of an easily curable disease this morning , but 50 years ago , he would have also died of an easily curable disease * and * i would have had to queue for 3 hours to get some bread and a few sheets of toilet paper '', 
  they make you use funnyjunk ? 
  that 's just cruel . 
  i was pushing * him * away ... the same way he did with * my heart * . 
  it means he 's terrified by what he feels when he looks at attractive men . 
  i mean , i know you 're joking , but if i went past a place guarded with dudes with crossbows , i would n't even try to do anything bad there . 
  if there 's one thing that really crosses the line with the taliban , it 's their anti-vaccination policies . 
  and serious about the dead . 
  i would n't call it that . 
  it 's a plot element discussed throughout the season , sure , but as usual with house of cards the point of the show is n't the policies and laws , it 's the intrigues around them . 
  and he did n't even send me a facebook event invite ? 
  screw that guy . 
  `` oh i 'm the son of god , i do n't communicate through social media '' , you think you 're better than us ? 
  i 'm * french * . 
  it 's my duty to show people my penis if they want to see it . 
  go one step further . 
  `` warning : the * jews * say you should n't use this knife to cut off your hand ! '', 
  `` ca n't you get a nice boyfriend who 's an interior designer ? '', 
  man , the fn really are thorough about keeping up traditions . 
  it 's like watching the rpr getting caught for doing the same thing 20 years ago . 
  we wo n't be kicked out or anything , but i think there might be some administrative shit to take care of ... which i 'm not looking forward to . 
  especially if all the europeans living in the uk end up having to do that at the same time . 
  i will * never * give up on making stupid , intricate plans to lock up marine , dude . 
  it 's too much fun . 
  i presume that 's what you meant , because otherwise your comment made no sense whatsoever . 
  i 'm living in england at the moment , and so are some of my non-uk citizen friends . 
  if you guys leave , it 's going to be a fun mess if we want to stick around . 
  quick !, 
  while she 's there , leave the eu and make it so she 's illegally in england so you can lock her up !, 
  now 's our chance , do n't fuck this up , uk !, 
  have n't we suffered enough ? 
  you 've gone too far this time , britain . 
  to be fair , sometimes when i have to deal with european bureaucracy , i kinda want to leave for syria too . 
  ah , a war in europe that involved the english . 
  what a surprise . 
  yeah , that 's true , i did n't really think about that . 
  maybe they 're just trying to show them shit 's getting real now . 
  who knows . 
  on the other hand ; if you have dangerous terrorists hiding somewhere , do you really just want to send regular cops to take care of it ? 
  oh , learn to take a joke .
