  as i said but if he want to negotiate he has plan ? 
  or he wants to give the falkland to argentina then `` negotiate '' is just a facade . 
  the same you might condemn the israeli army but not the fatah because it 's their land . 
  guantanamo is on us soil ? 
  or did they negotiate something with cuba ? 
  `` rebellion '' that 's sound like a hyperbole no ? 
  pick one https://www.google.fr/search?q=condition+refugi%c3%a9+hongrois&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=947&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoagovchmik66rprjxxwivrlgach0dvwsb&amp;dpr=1#q=condition+refugi%c3%a9+hongrois&amp;tbm=nws, 
  if he want to negotiate he has a plan right ? 
  we have a independentist movement in guyane https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mouvement_de_d%c3%a9colonisation_et_d'%c3%a9mancipation_sociale . 
  fun fact the actual minister of justice was part of this movement . 
  but that 's not the same the people who live in falklands are not native or a special ethnicity they are british who come here like what 50 year ago ? 
  what responsability ? 
  well yeah without the waterboarding the torture in general . 
  oh wait that 's a stupid thing to say but i understand people say stupid thing when they are frustrated . 
  what illegal immigrantion ? 
  the migrant go to germany or sweden . 
  so what ? 
  are you afraid you will be invade ? 
  or is it about the malvine ? 
  `` he also attended conferences which supported iraqi action against the west '' no shit when your country got invade you want to strike back . 
  `` wants to negotiate with argentina '' negotiate is good no ? 
  it 's better than sending soldiers . 
  `` he blames the west for tensions with russia '' ok that 's dumb . 
  `` he wants to leave nato and scrap our nuclear weapons along with pretty much reducing our armed forces to something similar to what ireland has '' good . 
  `` he supports hamas '' hamas are still resisting the zionist occupation but yeah they 're reactionnay . 
  `` about jahjah took distance from identity politics and is more operating out of a non-ethnic , secular and leftist framework . '', 
  seems good to me `` gerry adams '' it 's that because of ira ? 
  `` martin mcguinness '' i gues the same ira too ? 
  because i guess this person love free market . 
  a `` true '' leftist is a pathetic for the labour ? 
  i though they were a left party . 
  but if they are like the ps in france then it 's understable . 
  they can always complain about us working in their country . 
  i only undestood yougoslavia . 
  you seem to hate us more http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3634345/30-reasons-why-we-hate-the-french.html, 
  they do n't send us anything they are in a civil war against islamist . 
  find the swede . 
  i 'm not a catholic and i look like more like a arab than a white so probably not ^ ^, 
  i mean immigrant who come in 1960 and who stayed here . 
  i love cheese and i often complain . 
  only / r/france, 
  talking about the grand daughter of mussolini . 
  that depends i will take my personal experience in north of france . 
  i was living in a 20 000 city and they were a lot . 
  it 's because it was a `` mining town '' ( i do n't know if that make sens in english . 
  and a lot of north african come to work in the 50/60 /, 
  or maybe most of us do n't speak english very well . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_national_socialist_party they cut people heads off . 
  there is a documentary on them by a american i think . 
  ( not talking abou the black from the bbc ), 
  where is lorraine :(, 
  honhonhonhonhon but seriously we got 8 % of muslim . 
  hey i am here , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radical_nationalism_in_russia seems like neo nazi have evolve as long as you are white and chritstian you are ok . 
  daesh is the arab name if i 'm not wrong . 
   has anarchism flag  complain about refugee please go, 
  that 's not how a civilized society work . 
  he has to be juged and we do n't have the death penalty . 
  i wanted to say this but wow the some syrian refugee look so white . 
  as for the article it 's good to see that some children do n't follow the parent ideology . not like in italia : /, 
  give refugee better condition = / = accepting them in your home . 
  good job really using other people misery to make money . 
  just before you start saying bullshit the man is not a refugee/migrant but a guys who hide among refugee . 
  and for fuck sake isis , isil , daesh stick with on4e . 
  the situation of refugee in hungary is shitty but to compare that with the holocaust is stupid . 
  when i say racist i was talking about a nazi like party who get 16-20 % of vote . 
  i do n't mean anti immigration party like national front or ukip but with the like of anti jew anti gay etc. 
  that 's what i mean by `` welcome '' more social benefit more jobs , less racist population . 
  where did i defend nicolas sarkozy ? 
  and time to time when you take the bus or the train you will get assaulted and stabbed to death . 
  because it 's a poor country . 
  and that muslim get stabbed by neo nazi in moscow . 
  ca n't you at least come up with new maymay ? 
  muslim have been living in monoculture ? 
  in what country ? 
  `` american renaissance ( ar or amren ) is a `` race realist '' website '' no thanks, 
  when you threat people like dogs they are not happy who would 've thought . 
  i look on wikipedia it seems like it 's mostly kurds in iraq . 
  it would be weirds that faction like the ypg would do that . 
  '' i 've seen so many leftist politician completely ignoring facts on that , completely ignoring interviewer questions on criminal rates of immigrants that i have no faith in our own politicians to know what is best for us . '', 
  citation needed `` most non-arabic immigrants are doing fine and do n't cause any trouble , yet arabic immigrants just do n't seem to do well in europe . 
  and i believe our values are just too far apart . '', 
  you really think people will not have problem with black people even if they are christian . 
  yeah let 's take one example about people who are probably not syrian or iraqi refugee and make it sound like it 's the norm . 
  `` at that time '' did the european not always win againt the ottoman ? 
  kurds are more seculars ? . and genital mutilation is not a religious thing but a cultural one . 
  my bad i saw `` the guardian '' . 
  nevermind i saw `` the guardian '' sorry, 
  that was sarcasm . 
  i 'm not a `` ethnic french '' but what does it matter ? 
  i understand care about culture or religion , but ethnicity ? 
  it 's literally only a skin color . 
  why does it matters ? 
  do you think it 's worth it to go to a war just because you do n't want refugee . 
  edit : oh you 're a european mod that explain . 
  do you want a war with libya over refugee ? 
  i do n't think most of them hope for a bmw just for a job and a good life . 
  if refugee go to germany and sweden it 's because other country do n't welcome them ( france the first . ), 
  because our so called `` socialist '' leftist governement threat them like shit . 
  the condition in the `` jungle '' of calais is horrible .
