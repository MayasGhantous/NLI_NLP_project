  but the city is overrun by tourist , and i think most people get annoyed by that . 
  just seeing how in every major city , people are less polite than in the countryside just add to it . 
  a new yorker would n't be more polite . 
  the thing is , that maybe you 're the unpolite one ? 
  cuz you know , if you go further than stereotypes , we frenchis are n't that arrogant . 
  mostly a stereotype coming from when we were a monarchy ( louis xiv , building versailles , etc ) , and we beheaded the next louis , so . 
  the point of visiting a country is to figure this kind of stuff by yourself too . 
  not just using the stereotypes , find what 's truth , and what is n't . 
  and trying to figure where the differences really are , in depth . 
   it seems like the whole world is starting to conform to the idea of english being the lingua franca . 
  kind of ironic , when you know what `` lingua franca '' means , right ? 
  we 're not contesting that , but it 's only since the end of ww2 . 
  or maybe the cold war . 
  it does n't matter , anyway , langua franca or not , when you 're visiting a country , you should adapt to the locals , the locals should n't adapt to you . 
  besides , there are 6 official international languages . 
  and french is one of them . 
   i 'm danish and if i go to barcelona or warsaw i do expect people my age to be able to speak english . 
  well , we can . 
  or am i speaking russian to you right now ? 
  and even if we could n't , then it would be just more reasons for you to be able to speak french . 
   its kinda sad to see france lagging behind , and i think it might come to bite you guys in the ass . 
  i ca n't imagine many high paying international jobs in 20 years where english is n't an expected requirement . 
  do n't worry , while it 's true we 're kind of lagging behind , it 's not really a problem . 
  and we 're lagging a bit behind for everything anyway . 
  also people wanting thoses high paying international jobs probably will have more difficult thing to learn than just english , which is a pretty easy language to learn . 
  and it 's just badly pronounced french , anyway :d also , talking about thoses high paying job ? 
  do you know who 's the current head of the imf ? 
  or who it was before that ? 
  danes , right ? 
  to conclude , all of this does n't even matter . 
  if i go to new york , i wo n't speak in french , it should work both way . 
  so when i go to germany , i speak german , and when i was in rome , i spoke italian , doing as the roman did ... like i said , what are we , the background ? 
  you just want to follow the line some guy traced for you like you 're in a zoo ? 
  that 's not how you do trips , that 's not how you discover other cultures . 
  that 's just the lowest form of tourism ... are you just here to say that you did go to france ? 
  like i said , if you ' r enot meeting/talking to people , then what 's the point ? 
  if you 're here just for the food , or the sights , then just use google image and go to the nearest french restaurant in your country , it will save you money . 
  it 's before spanish and english : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers, 
  i 'm sorry , you meant to say mandarin , right ? 
  duolingo is your friend . 
  `` the year is 2015 a.c. 
  the world is entirely occupied by the english ... well , not entirely . 
  one small country of indomitable gauls still holds out againt the invaders . 
  and life is not easy for the english speaker who tries to visit it . '', 
  well , yeah . 
  except us . 
  it 's a subtle melange between not caring and being prideful , maybe a bit immature , but we 're still [ number one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings#most-visited_countries_by_international_tourist_arrivals_in_2013 ) , so why bother ? 
   and i agree with / u/norrisobe , when in rome , do like the romans . 
  if not , what 's the point of even coming in the first place ? 
  just passing through , seeing thing everyone else has already seen , and taking photos everyone else has already taken ? 
  if i 'm visiting a country , i will at least ** try ** to speak its language , because i 'm more here to see the culture/people , etc , and languages are the angular stone/fondation of any culture . 
  it worked well enough when i was in germany , or in rome . 
  and it 's not like no one speak english . 
  people whose job is to inform tourist all speak english , and i seriously doubt you can visit france without finding a tourist office . 
  it 's just the average joe which is not that good , and even he can give you basic direction . 
  and maybe it 's because we are that way that people enjoy to visit us . 
  l'acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise says it 's not `` ouch '' , but `` aie ! '' . 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ care ^ ^ about ^ ^ your ^ ^ little ^ ^ english ^ ^ speaking ^ ^ club , ^ ^ anyway . 
  oh , no , i catched it . 
  where is my sickness leave ? 
  what do you propose then ? 
  i 'm surprised it 's not china or egypt . 
  2:05 a shame that he is wearing clothes like that now . 
  well , i 'm an atheist and i do n't really care that you 're a jew . 
  so enjoy your stay . 
  i thought germans in vacation invaded this land . 
  some scandinavian country . 
  so not really shared weapons . 
  you 're mostly lending land . 
  shared ones ? 
  is there a true example of that ? 
  most likely , it 's just one country owning the wepaon , and deciding everything , and the other with nothing at all . 
  yes , i do n't know why there is so many colours on the map . 
  there should be only three , if you have nuclear weapons , if you have nuclear energy for electricty , or if you have none of both . 
  verordnung says that the stick ca n't be larger than 82.6 cm . 
  there would be three opinion , and they would all be to separate . 
  each willing to flee in the opposite direction than the other two . 
  `` welcome back , will you take your coffee in the royal suite , as usual ? '',

  wh\u00f6 lives on fr\u00f6zen lava far at sea ? 
  metz : saw it . 
  clear sky , no clouds . 
  there was a meetup , and people shared their telescopes . 
  it was pretty cool . 
  appart from the constant shoving down our throat about how your precarious job riddled economic model is soooooo much better and efficient than ours , and how we should imitate it , i think germany is pretty great . 
  i was learning german on duolingo , and gave up along the way for no reason . 
  i should start again . 
  haha , just look how many of us disagree . 
  and we are the stereotypically arrogant ones ? 
  if ww3 were to broke out , i do n't think we would have the choice to fight or hide . 
  how is marriage , gay or not , an human right ? 
  i 'm totally for it , just wondering . 
  you will like porco rosso even more !, 
  then , it 's a great and ingenuous design . 
  you pasta eater . 
  seriously , i would love to try that thing . 
  especially if you can fire without stopping . 
  yay , we 're not worse than the uk . 
  thought so . 
  really mind blowing to me .
