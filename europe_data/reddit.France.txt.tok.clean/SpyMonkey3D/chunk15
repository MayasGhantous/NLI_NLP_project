   wwiii has begun . 
  it 's not like you participated in the first two . 
  that one is great . 
  i thought it would be us vs the uk . 
  especially if you involve the colonies . 
  ( or maybe china vs china . ), 
  [ here it says 36 for sweden and denmark ] ( https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120308142016aa4kmld ) and [ on this list ] ( http://britishbattles.homestead.com/files/europe/anglofrenchwars.htm ) i count 34 + the `` wars of the french revolution '' which is at least 2 . 
  it also stops after the second coalition for some reason . 
  i guess we win , you rotten-fish eaters . 
  you know , the elections are in 2017 . 
  and if she 's elected to lead a region , it still not like she will be able to change much ... 
  so , no . 
  solution : war, 
  guys , it 's just another enarque who does not know what the fuck he is talking about . 
  it probably wo n't happen, 
  wrong , 6 . 
  you know , that would be a lot more fun to watch the news . 
  what 's a white christmas ? 
  it 's a balrog !, 
  if there is a problem in the eu , blame the greeks . 
  he 's not planning to invade turkey . 
  / s you could say it 's propaganda , but this much is expected . 
  the uk , this colony that turned badly . 
  and let 's not forget assad is still under the protection of russia . 
  in all of thoses cases , there was another ennemy , though . 
  the ussr for germany , north korea , and japan was worried about russia . 
  it helps . 
  and people were n't as opposed to the occupying forces . 
   military interventions work , provided that you have a clear goal and objective mechanisms of measuring progress . 
  unfortunately , too often there 's no clear endgame and the military is under political pressure to lie about its progress rather than request more resources . 
  yeah , it 's like the big idea behing the irak war was kicking ass and they just forgot about the post war plan . 
  i do n't think we will push for more . 
  i would be against it if it meant sending troops . 
  more airstrikes are okay , i guess ... 
  there are already boots on the ground , the kurds , assad , maybe the iranians . 
  intervening fully now would just mess thing up even more . 
  yeah , dresden and many others . 
  or plenty of cities in france for that matter . 
  when i see some photo , i wonder why people remember london . 
  joan of arc who booted you out of france . 
  [ the next step ] ( http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2012/03/1326999197-tenshinhansymboleilluminati.jpg ), 
  okay then . 
  i agree a lot actually . 
  it annoys me to see 14 years old saying shit like `` humanity is a virus '' on the internet . 
  same with some adults not having a much further level of understanding , yet , preaching . 
  you also ca n't argue with thoses people , cuz they strawman everything you say so hard . 
  yes , life is resilient , but do n't use that to deny the huge consequences and danger for our societies . 
  it 's not because we can survive it that we should n't worry about it . 
  also , your comment makes you look like a climate change denier . 
  dunno if you 're one or not, 
  til . 
  the imgur page linked is 9 months old . 
  that austrian dude . 
  unless you 're 90 + years old or dying from cancer , it could happen . 
  good thing the uk protected you ( a tiny part , at least ) , so we could keep protect them from the german , while also giving a bit of time to russia ... 
  i think / u/orthroxerox meant that both are federals countries . 
  here 's nice [ worldmap ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg/1280px-map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg.png ) showing federal countries in green and unitary in blue . 
  all countries that are older than 200 hundred years have a long history of this . 
  all of europe , egypt , china , japan , etc. 
  even ancient greece had strong leaders . 
  i do n't think the problem lies with a strong leadership , but really with the whole dynasty thing . 
  we like to have a competent guy leading . 
  and it can work , just look at the romans . 
  the original `` dictators '' gave the power back ( then one did n't ) and i 'm not talking just about my country , but humans in general . 
  but then , france always had a strong centralized power . 
  so i guess our culture increases that a bit . 
  that 's just a shitty poll . 
  just see what some people said about what happened with greece , and you can see much of europe would agree with statements like that, 
  read about the volkswagen scandal . 
  let 's hope they do n't invade mainland europe . 
  maybe they already did , but i did n't see much of this stupid shit outside english speaking news ( so the uk + us ), 
  will the germans update the softwares properly this time ? 
  you should tell us , ignorant foreigners what they are protesting against . 
  germany 's being on the left and france 's on the right annoys me way more than it should . 
  respect the geography . 
  well , i would n't say it 's that french since the goal is to imitate the german lander ( i guess ) , since we did n't save any money that way . 
  it was also a way for hollande to act like he was actually doing stuff as a president ... as for the second paragraph , well , i do n't know , but are n't we all moving that way ? 
  i hear a bit about decentralization from time to time . 
  i 've a friend who would do that . 
  his name is maximilien . 
  wait , they are sitll picking names ? 
  cool , merci !, 
  you do n't want to see mob justice . 
  people having access to a little information , and reaching conclusions without really thinking them out or verifying them . 
  a good example is the [ reddit witch hunt after the boston bombings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunil_tripathi ) people are fucking idiots ... 
  is there any chance the vote will be turned over by the government ? 
  a bit like the rome treaty ? 
  said the cuban, 
  or the third french empire . 
  i must suck at acronyms because i do n't see which stand for which . 
  which you obtain by people voting for you even though yoy were n't their first choice at all , and often because they just hate the other candidate more ... 
  i dunno , i took german in school , but i sucked at it when it concerned the nouns and declinaisons . 
  well , instead of doing the logical thing and use only the neutral one for all objects , etc , they can be female , male , and neutral . 
  basically [ this ] ( https://xkcd.com/927/ ), 
  which never happened, 
  did you ever try to learn german ? 
  instead of solving the problem , it just increases it . 
   because this is france , not us . 
  french system does n't reward the loser . 
  it rewards the ones who can go to the 2nd turn with 25/30 % ...  you did n't like the poll because it did n't follow your bias .
