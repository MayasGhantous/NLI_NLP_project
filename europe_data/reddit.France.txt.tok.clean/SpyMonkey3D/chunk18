  for example , the short term effects . 
  but stop with this fearmongering bullshit, 
  i 'm not even anti-eu , but that 's a shitty preach-to-the-converted article that uses semantics to avoid all the issues . 
  like i said , it 's a start . 
  i 'm also not an fn supporter or anything , my candidate was eliminated in the first round . 
  i also do n't know much about eu regulations , etc. 
  but even i know we got ignored on this . 
  he asked for an example , i gave him a pretty concrete one . 
  not like he wanted an exhaustive list ... also if they pulled this off once , what else did they do ? 
  that referendum was pretty important , if they ignore us on the big stuff , they will ignore us on the little stuff ... 
  there is also no doubt being in the eu put restriction on us , and others countries . 
  this is the very nature of a treaty after all . 
  who said that ? 
  do n't just drop quotes , we need the source . 
  i was wondeeing about that too . 
  there are n't that many info/seems controversial , but i found [ this ] ( http://www.armenian-genocide.org/kemal.html ) . 
  fairly partisan source , and the criticism is n't that harsh , imho . 
  [ here 's an askhistorian thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1xotp9/what_was_kemal_ataturks_involvement_and_view_of/ ) , the top comment touch a bit on that is interesting . 
  seems he did stuff , or rather , let stuff happen on the sides of building/rebuilding the nation without stopping it . 
  let 's start with the 2005 referendum . 
  you mean in europe , or just between france and germany ? 
  not really . 
  cooler and not by a god given right , and promoted the ideas of the revolution , in short , the [ best ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3hyyfwayzo/umivx-ixvhi/aaaaaaaaa58/gjhrxsk5cne/s1600/jacques+louis+davis,+napoleon_bonaparte.jpg ) ps : i thought this was a circlejerk , so my comment waa aimed as one . 
  erdogan instead of erdogan, 
  we can rent you a guillotine . 
  degaulle did n't call himself a gaullist , and the term does n't really mean anything , that 's why people with very different ideas can all claim they are gaullists ... 
  he also died in 70 , the context massively changed since then . 
  especially for the eu ( main focus nowadays ) , with no ussr and german reunification . 
  so please , can you change your description ? 
  yes , all of this is truth . 
  but we were talking about people remembering it , and my point was the emphasis is on the european front . 
  even in the us . 
  if you ask someone about a movie about ww2 , you will have answer like saving private ryan , the longest day , or maybe schindler 's list , before tora tora tora , or the thin red line . 
  yes , there are also big movies like flag of our father , or letter from iwo jima , but it seems to me the pacific front is a bit forgotten in the us too . 
  again , in the general culture , not what 's in the history book . 
  and that 's just my perception of the us culture . 
  `` in russia every profession has such a day '' . 
  how can you miss half of a comment ? 
  my question is how does it work for profession that are needed everyday . 
  say on the `` police day '' , not all police officer would take the day off , right ? 
  since policemen work in shifts , i wonder how it works out . 
  is the same level of service available during the day ? 
  same for doctors , hospitals , etc. 
  i talked about the public transport , say on `` bus driver day '' , no bus at all ? 
  how do people who rely on them get to work ? 
  and if people work on that day , well , it 's not really a day off for the whole profession i find it somewhat strange that each profession do it on their own . 
  he said `` in russia , every profession has such a day '' . 
  that what i 'm talking about . 
  and this is n't like national holidays at all . 
  national holiday are for everyone at once , not profession by profession . 
  also ours are eitheir for military/history or religious reasons . 
  so yeah , i think my question is pretty legit ... 
  it 's the way you said it . 
   they were able to divert most manpower . 
  yeah , no . 
  it was n't a diversion , it was total war . 
  a diversion also implies a plan , but the ussr was n't ready at all . 
  staline thought hitler would n't dare to attack just yet , and he got it wrong . 
  the first comment is like that too . 
  you talk about the uk and us pushing in italy , then you brush over the eastern front ... ( `` ww1 tactics '' . 
  urgh ) also , the north african campaign did n't have that many germans , the axis troops were mostly italians . 
  the afrika korps was 4 division , against 125 for operation barbarossa . 
  i doubt 4 divisions would nake that much difference , or that the italians troop would automatically be sent to the eastern front . 
  do n't people in the us do that too ? 
  i mean , people remember the d-day , etc , but for the pacific war besides hiroshima , i would say it did n't print itself in the culture that much . 
  ( ex : captain america punching hitler and not hirohito ) the nazis are the big ennemy , not imperial japan . 
  the us lost more people in the european theater after all . 
  but if we are talking about the pacific , we should mention china . 
  their losses were staggering too , and they were victims of stuff like nanking or unit 731 . 
  well , is n't doing that way just one of the most efficient/easy ? 
  dude . 
  not wanting to downplay the rest of the allies achievement , but ww2 in europe is basically the nazis vs the ussr . 
  source : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dwkpft-riou, 
  same . 
  i can remember the c'est pas sorcier episodes on arianne and kourou though . 
  well , to be fair , it 's pretty us centric . 
  john glenn came after gagarin , and as human , we remember the firsts , but not the second . 
  and you remember neil armstrong for example , so it 's not that bad , imho . 
  as for sally ride , she 's the youngest american astronaut , and the third woman in space ( after 2 from the ussr ) . 
  again , pretty us-centric . 
  and in the other hand , i ca n't say who the first french guy in space was ... 
  depends . 
  if you 're talking about users from each countries ( france , the uk , germany , etc ) , most likely , it 's just messing around . 
  just for fun , and there is centuries of history showing what happen when it 's actually serious . 
  it 's like ... that over the top nationalism ... is in fact , over the top ? 
  but if you are talking about the people who talk about europe as a whole , i kinda agree . 
  especially with the guys who are pro-federalism . 
  everyone ? 
  what about doctors , or people in public transports , etc ? 
  the stuff you ca n't really just leave alone for a day . 
   the first is something like a man backed up in heavy traffic saying `` let 's go , asshole ! '', 
  to the driver in front of him , indicating a selfish `` you need to progress so i can progress . '', 
  i would have loved to have an english teacher like you . 
  the 2015 version has only [ 17 % ] ( http://global100.adl.org/#country/france/2015 ) too . 
  make me doubt the reliability of such pollings . 
  i did n't look extensively , but i did n't find how many people were surveyed , but with a 20 % difference , i would say it 's unreliable . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://global100.adl.org/about#aboutantiindex ) . 
  it 's 500 by country . 
  it seems not enough to me . 
   i realize that this question might be too harsh as it might imply that every country is at least a bit anti semitic it 's true , though .
