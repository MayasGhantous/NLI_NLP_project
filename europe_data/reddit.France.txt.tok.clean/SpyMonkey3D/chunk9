  it has nothing to do with the sound it makes , though . 
  that 's our solution to ellen pao too . 
  off with her head, 
  thanks to reddit , i developped the habit of reading the comments before reading the article . 
  the rest guilt trip themselves about how it 's their country 's fault . 
  it 's not just on germany . 
  seriously , why the conversation is all about who 's to blame , and not about what to do ? 
  i think he meant the question as something a bit more personnal than that , for example , how much is he losing , or how many friggin years did he work to get it ? 
  and he could very well lose more than just his money in this . 
  woh , he looks so old now . 
  okay , i laughed . 
  i can open the windows at night , and i have a fan with two options : does n't work , and work a little . 
  i can also turn it off . 
  does the general population really believe that , though ? 
  you mean tourists on drugs everywhere , right ? 
   chicken tikka masala sounds very british, 
  was excepting asterix for us . 
  `` the greek bailout fund campaign page is experiencing some issues due to its astonishing popularity . 
  it should be back up shortly . '', 
  first time i liked reading a dailymail article . 
  that 's my point . 
  i disagree . 
  without the massive error that was the invasion of russia ( like i mentioned in my previous post , so i do n't see why you bring waterloo on the table ) , i think he had other options . 
  he wanted to reorganize europe under the continental system , so let 's say he does just that , without russia . 
  or he just stick to his initial objectives during the invasion and does n't lose most of his army . 
  he consolidates his power , and it 's not like the empire could n't go on without further wars . 
  even if the uk mount another coalition , with the grande arm\u00e9e still there , i think napoleon would win . 
  out of character , yeah , but not impossible , in my opinion . 
  well , the way you said it almost implied that the british were the ones in charge of the decision/wouldn ' t it happen like they had the means to enforce it at the time . 
  but if it was n't for the russian winter , i could see it happening . 
   very few british people would have accepted that . 
  not like it mattered more than other people 's opinion . 
  conferences on what ? 
   bootleg hentai manga we are very open to foreign cultures, 
  [ all to say ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/-nxiojhvu_iu/uwdvnszpwzi/aaaaaaaahbu/v2rpnde61om/s1600/stephen-colbert-popcorn.gif ) , we lost to the russian winter , not the rest of europe . 
  well , i think you could say that for france or the uk too . 
  maybe it 's just an european thing . 
  well , it 's good , but it could be better . 
  that 's a good point . 
   took 3 hours but got to see far more of portugal than we would have from the air . 
  and for 770 # less . 
  totally worth it . 
  competition ? 
   `` to read the full story , subscribe or sign in '' . 
  i do n't like to subcribe for news , so i did n't read the source . 
  nonetheless , cost , time , i think that it 's basically for the same reason . 
  areva over estimated itself , and your company listened without checking . 
  now , the question is if it 's just that areva was fine with lying , or if it 's incompetence on their part , or if they could n't know . 
  i think it 's a mix of the three , and epr are a new thing , after all . 
  also , cost estimate seems far too unreliable on big projects . 
  especially if there is no real precedent . 
  it kind of annoy me to see you get all the upvotes for my joke . 
  i say we put it in strasbourg . 
  our baguette are stronger . 
  [ our president ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/images/2014/12/06/2972694-hollande-chapka-jpg_2597227.jpg ) will destroy all of you .

  kind of sad . 
   merkel : `` i will safe the euro , no matter the cost '' german accent included . 
   i think if a war were to happen between finland and russia if this was likely to happen , then the situation would be a lot different . 
  i do n't see the point to speculate on this , too far fetched , imo . 
   or was it because they can actually build a reactor , unlike the french ? 
  are you refering to [ this ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20140902-french-built-finnish-nuclear-reactor-stream-nine-years-late ) ? 
  if so , like the article say your electricity company is also to blame for buying the unrealistic schedule , and being late does n't mean than we ca n't build one . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  good job going on a mad tangent and ignoring the original subject ... again . 
  can you realize that this little paragraph is about the same as what i was saying originally ? 
  happening in other places = other examples = maybe we should n't jump to conclusions and search for what thoses countries have in common to find the cause . 
  so no . 
  not `` again '' . 
  that 's not taking the tangents ... not on my part . 
  in fact , this discussion started to go awry once you started dissecting my answers in tiny little bits easily attackable without answering to my main point , and that 's all you did . 
  strawmans everywhere too . 
  easy to say then that 's i 'm wasting your time if you 're looking the other way when i 'm not . 
   i am the source of my opinion ... keep fooling yourself into believing that . 
  and your opinion does n't matter when you 're claiming something like `` russian culture is based heavily on machismo , homosexuality is seen as contradictory to that in russia . 
  ergo homosexuality is contradictory to russian culture . '', 
  like it 's a fact , thus me asking for source . 
  source that you did n't give me , then you have the balls to call me on my `` bullshit '' on other points when i act like you . 
  ( but only when it 's convenient for you , of course . 
  ) [ no , not the entire american continent is unanimously in favor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/societal_attitudes_toward_homosexuality ) ( lol , now that 's funny ) it 's only around [ 50 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_opinion_of_same-sex_marriage_in_the_united_states#polls_in_2015 ) ( and if your explanation exclude india and china when talking about the world at large , then do n't ) . 
  let 's see what 's thoses source pulling skills are now that you used them :  no but clearly you do . 
  `` i am ready to propose -- it would be a matter of a decree -- that the marriage ceremony , for a homosexual pacs , be made a right ... the ceremony would permit a true social acceptance [ of same-sex unions ] . '' - sarkozy 2012 1 year before gay marriage was legal in france . 
  did you even read that article ? 
  the tittle for example ? 
  or that part : `` but what sarkozy 's offering to the gays is almost insulting . '', 
  do you honetsly believe that because he said something like that , he would do it under the pressure of the people who elected him ? 
  and i need a phd to read that article ? 
  ( see what question you were answering ) also , he said that he would abrogate the law if he was elected in 2017 . 
  he is mingling around to get voters , the left wing put the subject on the table , and he decided to get in the train for obvious reasons . 
  that is all . 
   but `` culture '' is all encompassing ... 
  it means : the ideas , customs , and social behaviour of a particular people , society or demographic . 
  your stupid statements are getting tiresome . 
  perhaps buy a dictionary so you can learn what `` culture '' actually means ( e.g. 
  it does mean an entire populations collective actions , activities and traditions ) . 
  my dictionnary does n't say that and neitheir does this page : http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/culture now notice the seven other definition ... with the definition you pulled , i could say that you 're a moron , because , culture . 
  winning an argument through bigotry , bad faith and nitpicking is no win at all ... we might as well stop right here . 
   yes homophobia `` happens in a lot of other places '' , that 's not really an argument against why it happens though . 
  it 's not an argument , it 's a constatation . 
  appart from western countries , i think it 's safe to say that everyone is pretty much against gays .
