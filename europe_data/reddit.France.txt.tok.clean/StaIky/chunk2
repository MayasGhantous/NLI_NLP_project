  - someone - jaaaaa ha . 
  i visited morocco , a lot of the french influence is still present for example the language , a lot of people speak french and the infrastructures are generaly tri-lingual being arabic , tamazight and french [ for example ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/tizi_ouzou_tasdawit.jpg?uselang=fr ) . 
  morocco always had strong ties to france , it was a protectorat , more like a puppet state of france not a full on colony like algeria , independance was taken smoother . 
  speaking of algeria , i 've never been there , but algeria was considered a french region and part of france up until the 1950s . 
  then they had an independence war where a lot of blood was spilled , we 're talking tens of thousands dead , torture was of the habit . 
  france recruted algerian farmers who did n't knew better to fight along them against algeria basically recruiting traitors . 
  when the war was lost the traitors were left behind and well , about 80 000 people and their families were slaugheted in a horrible way .

  even after your explaination it 's still weird to me , i hear americans say they 're 1/16th french or 1/8th german like it actually matters . 
  but the worse is when they refer themselves as `` irish '' when they have nothing in common with ireland . 
  in my country , what you are is your nationality , if you are borned and raised in a given country you are from this country . 
  this is why even if i 'm ethnically 100 % moroccan i always refer myself as french especially considering my family has been french since 3 generation . 
  it 's a very common saying from the 20th century , i heard it a lot , but most people call americans the `` ricain '' where i 'm from . 
  do you already know a foreign language ? 
  learning english is way less important for us than it is for dutchs and nordics and we 're perfectly fine with it . 
  we litteraly do n't need it , our language is strong enough to have everything we need in french . 
  there are 300 million french speakers across all continents while if you combine dutch + swedish + finnish + dannish + norwegian you get 40 million speakers . 
  for a clearer example , the number of people speaking danish , swedish and finnish combined is roughly the size of the paris area alone . 
  french is also an official language of many countries in africa as you can see [ here ] ( http://puu.sh/nysr5/782e541bb0.png ) , dubbing movies in french represent a huge economic advantage . 
  as for the bad english profeciency , if you want to see who is really bad at foreign languages in the eu look at the uk , frenchs , italians and spanishs may not be the best at english but we 're excellent in each other 's language . 
  most french people have a very good italian or spanish . 
  the fact that we 're not forcibly listening to english in our entertainement is n't the most important factor . 
  you do n't understand british people you just nod and point out the neareast pub . 
  most europeans support bernie because what he offers is closer to our system , for example healthcare and free education , hell i even get paid to get educated . 
  i do n't think trump is less of a circlejerk . 
  what the hell ? 
  we covered world war 2 in middle school, 
  i do n't really hear about us elections on tv news , most people i 've talked to about it did n't know who bernie sanders was and thought of mr.clinton not mrs. 
  swedish ? 
  that 's just a legend we tell the children before they sleep, 
  what types of game are you making ? 
   38 000 there 's norway you make that much, 
  i 'm a sudent going to college , i make about 4500 $ a year tax free but i do n't work i just go to college . 
  everything you said still applies to italian and spanish and yet the frenchs are excellent at those languages . 
  i hope we can regain trust on our politicians and come out with a more democratic system like maybe switzeland or liechtenstein . 
  i 'm not sure where we 're going , when i look at the year 1916 so much things have changed , so for 2116 it 's beyond my imagination considering the rate of change is exponential , i can picture 2025 but not 2116 . 
   `` the current seven rates of personal income tax will collapse into a single low rate of 10 percent . 
  [ the poor ] c = = = = = = = 3 [ the rich ], 
  there 's a lot more than just the quality of language teaching , english is * very * hard for frenchs , just because it 's easy for the germans or the dutch does n't mean it 's the same for the french . 
  [ you can watch this very interesting video , activate the english youtube subs . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvoxybdqd1k ) french people are however excellent at italian and spanish . 
  we only know one candidate and we make fun of you for it . 
  no one cares about the elections , the only political man who said something was jean marie le pen ( far right , known for being racist , holocost denier ) who vouched for donald trump which of course lead us to make fun of you even more ( sorry ) . 
  no one knows the process or the other candidates , but i think if they did they would be for sanders because free education and social security is considered a human right . 
  generally speaking france is more leftist than the us , someone like sanders would be centrist , cliton conservative , trump a troll with 0 credibility , cruz in another dimension . 
  at least your prisons seems to work , here they 're just a crime and radicalisation factory . 
  you get in as a petty dealer you come out of it as a radical islamist or affiliated with organized crime . 
  in 2003 during the great canicule it was really common in the south of france , it was really nothing uncommon to see canadairs . 
   i was born in america by default when you started your sentence with this i was afraid you were going to be one of these `` i 'm 1/64 this '' type of american . 
  i hope you enjoyed poland it 's a beautiful country . 
  starbucks will probably have to adapt their market , for example contrary to what people would 've thought at first mcdonald was a great success in france because they adapted to the market . 
  the meals are a little more expensive ( 5 $ -6 $ for a big mac menu ) , the portions are definitly smaller but the quality is overall better partly due to all the laws regarding food . 
  [ there 's an article in english about it ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/01/24/145698222/why-mcdonalds-in-france-doesnt-feel-like-fast-food ) . 
  kebab is the dominating street food in a lot of countries . 
  after that it depends in which region you live as there 's drastic changes in regards to food , i live in a coastal city in the south east called la seyne sur mer , near toulon . 
  and if you go on the market anyday you can eat [ cade ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/socca_in_nice.jpg/280px-socca_in_nice.jpg ) or `` socca '' which is a salted galette made with chickpea flour . 
  there are also various street cooks who can sell you meals made in big wok [ like this ] ( https://www.ouest-var.net/actualite/23eme-fete-de-la-bouillabaisse-et-spectacle-french-cancan-sur-le-quai-saint-pierre-150059.jpg ) . 
  since i live in a coastal city it 's often fish stew , generally [ bouillabaisse ] ( http://www.taste.com.au/images/recipes/mc/2010/06/24187_l.jpg ) . 
   security might be a bitch going into paris cause i 'm sikh . 
  wtf did i just read, 
  remind me i should carry a bulletproof vest because everyone is shooting each other in america . 
  and then you read the comment section of the default subreddits, 
  a 4 room 80m \u00b2 appartement , living on c\u00f4te d'azur . 
  driveless cars for sure . 
  so what happens next ? 
  one part to france and one part to netherland ? 
  it worked on my end , does it work [ here ] ( http://puu.sh/nmrx5/b841207057.png ) ? 
  the corses , the bretons , the parisians , the chti ( northeners ) , the alsacians , the provincials ( south east ) , the south west and i 'm probably forgetting a lot more . 
  [ relevant polandball , each stripe represent a region ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zskx0a2.png ) it 's the regions with the strongest identity , they all have their own culture , history , accent and language ( even if regional languages are n't popular anymore ) . 
  there are also the french territories accross the globe who might aswell be their own country given the cultural differences [ here 's a map ] ( http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/images/domtom.gif ) . 
  it 's a camouflage plan, 
  yup it 's called populism , the same thing is happening with the fn here . 
  their economic program is laughed at by every expert and they honestly think closing down all borders , leaving eu , get rid of the euro currency and expelling migrants en masse is going to save the country . 
  what 's the most scarry is that this party was openly racist 15 years ago but since the daughter took over they tried to tone down their speech to be more likable , people forget that the apple never falls far from the tree . 
  the fact that our supposedly leftist governement is going full repressive retard . 
  due to the paris attacks we 're in an urgent state situation , that means police and gendarmerie have more power and military are patrolling the streets or stationed at train stations . 
  the police can search your home without a warrant , they can arrest you and put you under house arrest without a trial and are even allowed to carry a gun off duty . 
  also they 're going to pass a series of law to fuck the workers over , i 've never seen something like this , this is the first time in my life i see a leftist governement being right wing to the point of scaring the right wings themselves . 
  [ this is us right now ] ( https://bloggingtheologydotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/liberty.png ) i do n't care about the migrants or zika or whatever shit the media is going to throw at us to make their audience what i care about is the political mess we live in . 
  berlin has an amazing night life and is overall a great city , also you must probably know but just in case some people in your group are worried , drinking is legal at 18 or 16 year old in most countries . 
  your list is already solid imo . 
  racism and abuse of power exist in the police , nothing new under the sun sadly . 
   you could say that leaving the eu makes the uk less racist as everyone outside the uk is on an even playing field and none europeans are no longer being discriminated against i 'm not following you , you litteraly said it 's racist . 
  since when immigration policy needs to be fair ? 
  it has always been about your qualifications and your country 's relations with others . 
  are n't people within the uk free to go where they want within the uk for example scotland to england ? 
  does that mean other people from other nationalities are discriminated against because they can not do so ? 
  a few years ago h1n1 was supposed to wipe our specy , ebola was the doom of mankind and now rapefugees are going to destroy our civilisation . 
  honestly it 's not a big deal , nothing is going to go down , it 's just the media trying as hard as they can to get the audience numbers they want by playing with our fears . 
  also foreign media generally exagerate , and i 'm specifically talking about american media and then americans on reddit see that and think europe is under a califat . 
  [ but we love mocking fox news ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=28b_1421201170 ) [ a lot . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf_68dvakko ), 
  `` discriminating non europeans '' we 're not discriminating non europeans it 's just an alliance and giving certain perks to some countries in that alliance . 
  it would be racist if we were `` discriminating '' people based on their skin colour and not their nationality but in in the end it 's not even discrimination they just do n't have certain rights european citizens have just like someone who do not have the uk citizenship does n't have access to certain rights in uk . 
  that 's not being racist . 
  i do n't speak dutch but here 's the thing , i 've never heard dutch . 
  weither it 's in movies , in videos , on the street i 've never heard dutch people speaking their language . 
  the only kind of dutch i heard is flamand the belgian dutch . 
  all the dutch i 've seen spoke english and could n't wrap their head around the fact that someone born in a country like spain or france might not need to speak english . 
  i remember a dutch posted on / r/france and was * really * mad and vulgar at french people for not being completly bi-lingual .
