  in what fucking world do you live ? 
  your blabbering about putin conquering all of europe is the true dementia here . 
  also , poland had fucking cia prisons , how is that a `` shining success '' in the eyes of anyone other than goebbelsian personas ? 
  in poland people have to live off shit wages in facilities such as amazon 's ones . 
  it 's , along the czech republic , the china of europe . 
  it 's not difficult to be more patriotic than people burning down a city center to sell their country to nato . 
  oh the treason !, 
  you 're clearly a philosopher . 
  and i 'm clearly a putinist shill when one post away i am praising the kpu and the kprf . 
  what 's deep with you is that your kind obsessively `` mourn '' those 100 anonymous that you never saw and without knowing their motive . 
  but when thousands lose their home to shells from their own country 's army , you lack any kind of empathy . 
  i would , if it could singlehandedly have that effect . 
  there were also russian battalions serving hitler . 
  no , he described euro-ukraine . 
  what did the kpu did as `` treason '' ? 
  it did everything possible to save its nation from euromaidan and nato . 
  heaven does n't exists . 
  but if it did , and god 's will is just , they would n't end up there . 
  from the alps to the pyrenees . 
  what a country . 
  an englishman not willing to bet ? 
  turn over your passport at the nearest consulate and retire yourself to australia . 
  yeah , poor choice of words from my part . 
  it was still the most industrialized until the late 1970s . 
  it then progressively closed , until the last mine was shut down in the 2000s . 
   `` third world '' : used to be a thriving industrial region , but then the coal more or less ran out and france went nuclear ; nowadays the highest unemployment area . 
  still plenty of coal . 
  it 's just not profitable enough . 
  did n't you follow the huge social movements against the closures ? 
  i always thought they were in the same league ... 
  yes, 
  zara is low cost now ? 
  what 's high end then ? 
  it 's convenient to have lost a representation of the figure and ideology you 've been slandering for decades . 
  `` lost '' . 
  how convenient . 
   tl ; dr communism screws markets who knew that an economy choosing to not rely on markets would `` screw '' them ? 
  genius . 
  internal `` peace '' for exterior wars . 
  yay . 
  it began like that , and also to form the antisovietic bloc . 
  hardly peace . 
  the ode has undertones of peace in its composition ; european construction was never about peace indeed , but many people pretend it was . 
  the eu kinda defeats the message about the ode , since it 's supposed to be about peace . 
  this thread is garbage . 
  do you have anything to support this claim , or is it a conspiration theory ? 
  they 're the enemy, 
  we 're not discussing your government , nor the national guard thugs , 
   ok this was a trainwreck probably caused by a russian missile amirite ? 
  agreed . 
  lol . 
  maybe because i did n't want half of europe murdered , unlike you . 
  hiding neonazism behind your `` petty-eastern-nationalism '' privilege is really low . 
  without the eastern front , we would have a thousand oradour , a thing that you probably wish for ; with that in mind , i can say exactly the same about your perspective . 
  besides , the faz is from frankfurt . 
  not really eastern europe , is it ? 
  no wonder ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ ~ ~ putin ~ ~ * ahem * hitler wanted to kill them all , i empathize with him . 
  chauvinism and/or petty football team mindset ... 
  the rest is just details . 
  / r/europe . 
  and of the journalist of the faz who said he would have rather have hitler win than the soviets , on 02 june 2014 . 
  one siberian `` artist '' postmodern shits a text , and / r/europe thinks all siberia is on the verge of revolution . 
  althought obama and merkel sure would want that , in order to destabilize the region . 
  no no no . 
  putin is not simply * evil * . 
  he is ** hitler ** . 
  also , all russians support him unconditionally . 
  because they is ** dumb ** . 
  dumb asiatic hordes . 
  it 's not . 
  i 'm not a regular commenter so i can see the craziness here . 
  / r/europe in a nutshell, 
  you already did . 
  no racism nor militarist propaganda in glorious westeurope and america . 
  nope . 
  reddit , the home of / r/niggers , is the shining proof of that . 
  what were the results of the last european elections ? 
  oh , right . 
  touchy spot . 
  and who elected them ? 
  you mean : before the coup d'\u00e9tat , they were all meanies , and now just because some thugs with molotov cocktails bombed the maidan until it 's charcoal-black , it 's all rosy nilly democracy ? 
  edit : going from +20 to -14 . 
  if half your people supports the `` enemy '' , maybe we should bomb lvov and not the donbass . 
  or federalize . 
  they do n't even respect the rules that are made for them ... 
  they act as if they were legit taxis . 
   without the eu we 'd all eventually be dominated by corporations . 
  so now we 're dominated by corporations and statesmen . 
  yay . 
   europe as one singular market is , however , important enough to do just that . 
  nah , it just empowers the ruling class more . 
  markets do that , unified markets do that even more . 
  i think the eu is the problem . 
  like it or not , the hamas is a political organization that is a kingpin of the national unity of israel ; national liberation can not be done without their force , and this is precisely why israel wants to destroy them , and scare the palestinians away from voting for them . 
  they do , and already did this with any political leader in the position to unify palestine against occupation . 
  they already did with yasser arafat . 
  i am not a islamist theorician , and neither are you . 
  but neither you and me , and particularly the idf , are in the position to dictate the palestinians on how they vote . 
  aha , remind me when did i say that ? 
  and how can you tell if i am anti-semitic ?
