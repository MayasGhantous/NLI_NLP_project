  kyrgyzstan most notably too . 
  some other central asian countries , but kyrgyzstan has all of its elite from turkish universities . 
  fear for the might of the netherlands !, 
  i 'm not the one supporting the tanks sent in eastern ukraine . 
  you might want to revise your insults , especially when they discredit the author more than the victims . 
  learn to spell before feeling bad for them . 
  \\  russia does propaganda via astroturfing = bad \\  eu does progandaga via astroturfing = good . 
  we 're the good guys . 
  i tend to forget this . 
  you very well know that `` nato involvement '' is shorthand for nato countries involvement ... you 're just playing dumb . 
  or you are . 
  and greece has no real intention/interest ( being bailed out by russia ? 
  lol . ), 
  to side with russia . 
  it 's just an empty threat they sometime wield . 
  you 're giving too much credit to that proverbial sabre-ratting . 
  have you been held in a basement those last 15 years , or are you shitting me ? 
  first of all , the most recent example is ukraine . 
  then there is the colored revolutions which swept throught eastern europe and the caucasus in the middle of the 2000s .

  i hope the library of congress is n't excessively pro-russian for you . 
  you are really more royalist than the king , are n't you ? 
  why would a russia sanction itself ? 
  how would you sanction yourself ? 
  you write as if you were under some kind of shock , did you trip and fall ? 
  i think the eu does not need russia to be divided on ukraine . 
  this is just all rhetoric to falsely associates governments who disagree on a strategic basis on ukraine with russia . 
  i do n't know if i 'm qualified to take any guess , as there is no evidence to examine . 
  no , they just sponsor coups . 
  no big deal, 
  well there was n't apparently . 
   when you are surrounded by blood thirsty finns or descendants of genghis khan no wonder you build strong military . 
  how about nato ? 
  it 's especially hypocritical because many of those refugees are put in that situation by wars in which european powers are largely to blame ( namely france ) . 
  now , i get italians , greeks , and spaniards are left alone in this mess , and i understand being bitter about that , as it should be a collective effort to welcome them . 
  if we do n't want an increase in asylum-seeking refugees , we should work on not messing up africa with imperialist policies . 
  they ended up being some of the most trusted soldiers and generals of the empire ? 
  it 's interesting that the most powerful argument you found to not let refugees die is tourism . 
   correlation does not imply causality . 
  he never implied a causality . 
   mein kampf and quran are remarkably similar a sentence that starts this way can not be true . 
   su contributed greatly to hitler success at the early stage of the war munich . 
  til bora-bora is in french polynesia !, 
  i do n't think the op meant interesting for investments . 
  those pictures are clearly from the 50s and 60s thought . 
  looks like he 's closing the door to russia more and more lately . 
  either directions he will take will be a bet . 
  ditching russia is a bet that they wo n't succeed in crawling back to them ( since their armed forces have their hands more and more full , and their economy is collapsing ) . 
  staying with russia is just the opposite bet , that is that russia wo n't drag belarus with it in its collapse . 
  and as the situation escalates , lukashenko wo n't be able to play the sort of equilibrium that was possible before . 
  no more frenchies in london !, 
  really you can ? 
  i highly doubt it ... got a link ? 
  i thought the franc had absolutely no value as far as the french authorities are concerned . 
  anyway , this is all a bit tangential . 
  even if some commercial entities may accept the old currency , you can not trade francs for euros with the french central bank anymore . 
  it 's convenient to ignore data you do n't like . 
  there is no europe-wide policy on that ( since , you know , pre-euro was multiple currencies ) . 
  some countries will no longer take back their old currency ( like france ) , but many do . 
  in most cases , coins will not be exchanged . 
  bills might , thought . 
  it 's eid . 
  eid mubarak is `` happy eid '' . 
  `` old russian state '' redirects toward kievan rus in the english wikipedia too ... and the russian article immediatly clarifies the various historiographies about the era , in the first section , mentionning * \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c * ( second line !! ), 
  i suggest chilling out . 
  edit : http://www.rg.ru/2011/11/02/rus.html `` nowadays , the term < kievan rus  is considered obsolete '' . 
  there is clearly a controversy to what we should call the medieval state . 
   that the famous stand-up comedian `` coluche '' was assissinated because he posed a threat to the power ( he would ran for the presidential election to mock the establishment , and died in a traffic accident ) . 
  that 's one i will never understand . 
  coluche never set out to pose any kind of threat or competition , on the contrary . 
  nevermind adn is mostly decayed after a few centuries . 
  we do n't eat frogs nearly as much as you eat bacon and pudding and other culinary anomalies . 
  i 'd rather be savage than eat eggs and/or bacon for breakfast . 
  i guess french . 
  in case you did n't notice , the ussr fell . 
  russia is n't exactly communist right now ... 
  yup , it appears i used it properly . 
  i guess folks do n't like to see their cognitive dissonances exposed . 
  `` i 've got nothing against russians , i just want to destroy/balkanize their country that 's all '' . 
  european values like letting people drown in the meditteranean . 
  would be a shame to lose those . 
  komsomolskaya pravda is n't state-controlled . 
  you could n't keep moscow for 2 years and now you want to occupy all of europe west of rhine ? 
  so it 's polish ? 
  i just learned the word `` sauce '' in five languages . 
  so , in some sort , the nazi reich * will * exist for a thousand years . 
  except the most basic words such as `` of '' , `` to be '' , `` to have '' , `` about '' , `` you '' , ect ect ... are n't latin in origin , but rather germanic or from another germanic language . 
  besides , the words you picked only differ from one letter . 
  contrat and contract seem to be both very close to contractum , since they have the same root word ... 
  so yes , french is closer to latin than english for that important aspect . 
  what 's closer to habere ? 
  avoir or have ... ? 
  same question for esse : is `` esse '' closer than '' \u00eatre '' or `` to be '' ? 
  and it goes on , and on , and on for many words , and i 'm sure for the most commonly used words of each language . 
  your comment on phrase structure is interesting , as old englis had declensions , but they were phased out partially in middle english , and almost totally in modern english ( save for words such as `` whom '' which are holdovers ) , bringing it closer to french . 
  but none can be argued to be close to classical latin . 
  see the lord 's prayer : ** english ** * our father in heaven , * * hallowed be your name , * * your kingdom come , * * your will be done , * * on earth as in heaven . 
  * * give us today our daily bread . 
  * * forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us . 
  * * save us from the time of trial , * * and deliver us from evil .
