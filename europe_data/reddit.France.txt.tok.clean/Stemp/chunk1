  un croque madame am\u00e9lior\u00e9 : [ francesinha ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/francesinha ) :-), 
  you should really apologise more . 
  we only send the best politicians to the eu commission . 
  our last minister of finance was so good we decided not to keep him to send him to bruxelles . 
  i 'll take your alenka anyday instead of our [ pierre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_moscovici ) . 
  if you like that , try the [ tarn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorges_du_tarn ) gorges, 
   you wo n't get official figures for france . 
  official census ~ ~ do not ~ ~ can not ask for ethnic origin or religion here . 
  i understand you , i 'm from french ( best ) flanders , and if it 's part of france now it ceased to be a colony and it 's therefore a former colony !, 
  new caledonia is not a former colony !, 
  it 's part of france . 
  we had [ caviar left ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gauche_caviar ) , champagne is too cheap ;-), 
  yes , but he is the head of state . 
  the government ( the prime minister ) is at risk . 
  [ flower of scotland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vkyicdn834 ), 
  nope , bristish song adapted by a french and sang by an american ;-),

  i do n't understand , the link provided by them give oliver as n \u00b0 1 and muhammad as n \u00b0 15 !, 
  [ modern pentathlon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_pentathlon ) just add the tank competition and ... modern hexathlon !, 
  no , no , the vacancy rate was 7,2 % in 2013 , it 's pretty good in fact . 
  [ i 'm older ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w4xulsjo5i ), 
  i 'm surprised belgium and netherlands does n't have taller building . 
  netherlands have one of the biggest density !, 
  again :-p, 
  anyway the eiffel tower is taller , and in paris :-), 
  [ advantages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubber-tyred_metro#advantages ), 
  from this link : `` house of romania ( formerly and agnatically still the house of hohenzollern-sigmaringen ) '', 
  we have a [ tool ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillotine ) to get rid of the [ bourbon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_bourbon ) if you need . 
  dutch , german or french !, 
  come on , we had more wars than they had fights !, 
  we even had a 100 years war !, 
  it 's pretty famous in france too if it 's closer ;-),

  cahors for bulgaria ? 
  what am i missing here ? 
  i always loved this [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zxmepnv.jpg ), 
  it was a joke ( hence the :-p ) and you 're republican !, 
   which makes sense as the latin root for prince is `` first '' . 
  elena is `` first '' and she 's an infant :-p, 
  yes , you are . 
  except if you 're from andorra , portugal or former spanish colonies such as the philippines , equatorial guinea or latin american countries . 
  welcome . 
   russians obviously did n't want foreign visitors , so probably all of you will be watching transmission . 
  what ?

  \u00c9lisabeth ii queen of france ? 
  she is speaking a perfect french , that 's a start . 
  be right back , i 'm going to the shop to buy wines from britanny , normandy and the rare but exclusive french flemish wine . 
  is this map a joke ? 
  in 1996 they proclaimed the `` repubblica federale della padania '' , and south tyrol was part of it . 
  if italy collapse then it 's possible for south tyrol to join austria or even switzerland . 
  but for me it 's just science-fiction . 
  i do n't think there is even a strong independance movement ( but maybe i 'm wrong ) . 
  if my aunt had balls , she 'd be my uncle, 
  [ micmacs \u00e0 tire-larigot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micmacs_%28film%29 ) ? 
  yes , thanks , i 'm just too dumb . 
  | maybe i just gave some poor italian redditor a heart attack . 
  not just italian redditors, 
  it turned out she was right , they had a message to carry on , they keep their beards and clothings to show solidarity to the other hostages . 
  maybe because presseurop will lost his contract with the eu at the end of the year . 
  i think it is run by [ courrier international ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courrier_international ), 
   france wins against austria 6-0 in the 2014 qualifiers . 
  yeah , bitch . 
  australia, 
  une carbonade flamande !, 
  we have [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ybs3ssr.jpg ) , it 's [ superdupont ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superdupont ) !, 
   anyway , thanks for picking that up - mea culpa . 
  i 'll go and buy some more goudale to say sorry . 
  d = ok , that 's good enough to be excused :p, 
  `` which is from the bit of france that 's been swapped back and forth with germany half a dozen times in the last few centuries , which is probably why it 's the main beer producing region in the country '' where did you get this idea ? 
   [ douai ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/douai ) is part of the [ romance flanders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romance_flanders ) , it 's north of france , not far away from belgium . 
  illegal immigrants are only an economical problem . 
  they are cheap labour for some and can hurt the low salaries . 
  except for that it 's only immigrants . 
  do they want to integrate to your culture or not ? 
   it 's a shame really , fighting about these languages while our culture is practically the same . 
  i could n't agree more with you , 
   i 'm guessing you 're from that part of flanders that was annexed by france after wwi , do you speak dutch ? 
  what part of flanders was annexed after wwi ? 
  anyway my family is mainly from [ rysel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lille ) but were speaking flemish . 
  i was understanding it while i was a kid , i sadly do n't speak it . 
  i 'm sorry but i 'm not playing the victimhood card . 
  my grand-parents were denied the right to speak their language at school . 
  menen share his main street with a french city !, 
  belgium is a multilangual country !, 
  and you ca n't use french there while 90 % of the population know it ? 
  tell me it 's not xenophobic . 
  and tell me the flemish do n't feel superior to the wallon . 
  ps : i 'm partly a flemish ( more than half ) .
