  fair enough , i take it . 
  i was just pissed off . 
  44 % percent of the population live in menin !!, 
  they speak french , and because it 's memen and it 's flanders ( dutch speaking flanders ) , you think it 's ok to denied them the right to officialy use their language ? 
  really ? 
  remind me of the `` old europe '' rant from bush 's administration . 
  i do n't remember blair defending us . 
  so i guess it 's ok to call britain a small island . 
  nope, 
  i 've move back from london a long time ago , can i still play ? 
  ** how difficult was learning the language ? 
  ** i was quite fluent ** any hostility ? 
  ** yes but i 'm not a cheese-eating surrender monkeys 's kind of french . 
  ** do you feel integrated ? 
  do you have a timeline on when you will ? 
  ** i was a londoner ** how is your new country better/worse than your old one ? 
  ** london is nice , but i prefer south of france . 
  ** are you planning to settle ? 
  ** i never thought about it ** how difficult was it to gain employment in your new country ? 
  ** compare to my country ? 
  easy !, 
  ** any things you wish you knew before you left ? 
  ** not really . 
  ** is the quality of life better in your new one ? 
  ** i went to uk !, 
  of course it was worse !, 
  ** do you find the culture overwhelming ? 
  ** no ** how difficult was/is it making new friends ? 
  ( with other emigrants and also the natives ) ** easy ** what 're your future plans ? 
  ** to stay in my country or to go to laos . 
  ** what were your reasons for moving ? 
  ** love !, 
  what else ? 
  remember [ castillon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_castillon ) !, 
  there is vercing\u00e9torix , jeanne d'arc and [ charles martel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_martel ) but do n't forget [ bayard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_terrail,_seigneur_de_bayard ) and [ du guesclin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bertrand_du_guesclin ) . 
  check the sources on the image , 
  ok :( we will now use dachfenster . 
  i sadly can confirm this for paris . 
  since the ban on smoking in bars it 's a disaster . 
  monaco neither, 
  you really need medical attention when you compare the president of russia with a man protecting child abusers . 
  it 's not brighter than paris or lyon 's area . 
  belgium as a whole is very dense ( 365 pop . / km2 ) . 
  in france it 's quite different , the nord d\u00e9partement ( lille by example ) is 449 pop . / km2 and loz\u00e8re is 15 !, 
  gas flare . 
  check lille-roubaix-tourcoing , it 's as bright as belgium . 
   the uk , ** ireland ** and france are among the eu countries estimated to have the highest numbers of fighters in syria . 
  ireland ? 
  why is that ? 
  just imagine when they 'll find out chechnya share a border with georgia . 
  atlanta will be on alert !, 
  not again !, 
  [ british in france : practical help ] ( http://www.britishinfrance.com/b14france.html ), 
  how dare you insult my princess catharina-amalia !, 
  go with england if you want but we will keep the principality of orange !, 
  bs , eifel should be french !, 
  and south and west of the rhine !, 
  so give us back dusseldorp . 
  too far north ? 
  what d\u00e9partement are you from anyway ? 
  [ zuyderz\u00e9e ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuyderz%c3%a9e ) or [ frise ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frise_%28department%29 ) ? 
  and `` [ asia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asia_%28roman_province%29 ) '' was a small part of modern turkey . 
  and take this [ french kitten ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldkv8qc.jpg ) to cheer you up . 
  thank you for not blaming the french , but only our government . 
  to remember ? 
  they are still in my playlist :-) and ... you kids get off my lawn !, 
  maybe the horses are farting less ? 
  it 's now restored and will be back on exhibition tomorrow . 
  yes , and che guevara was a m.d. , lenin was a lawyer from the university of saint-petersburg and andrew johnson was a tailor !, 
  sure . 
  serge halimi is not a real journalist he is a far-far-left politician/apologist . 
  not a politician seeking election , just an `` intellectual '' . 
  he will always find more excuses for kim jong-un than for any westerner 's elected officials . 
  just try ctrl-f `` neoliberal '' or `` neo-colonialism '' on any of his papers . 
  i have to say i agree with him on the tuaregs 's part . 
  we 're not talking enough about this issue . 
  except for that , it 's only usual extremist far-left rethoric . 
  i ca n't take seriously anything written by serge halimi . 
  it 's free if you 're under 25 and living in the european economic area . 
  well an echo can be * artes * stic ? 
  in fact you were right , i need to apologise :-d, 
  no need to apologise , i was just wondering where you get this name from ;-), 
  where did you get that name ? 
  it 's les echos . 
  yeah sure , the federal government of belgium is working so well you should expand it to the benelux . 
  from gypsy language : [ chouraver ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chouraver ) ( to steal ) [ michto ] ( http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/michto ) ( good ) [ gadjo ] ( http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/gadjo ) ( man/guy ) [ narvalo ] ( http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/narvalo ) ( mad/stupid ) [ marave ] ( http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/marave ) ( fight ), 
  of course , most of the workers you see in monaco are french or italians . 
  but like the people working in manhattan , they take the [ train ] ( http://www.ter-sncf.com/region/paca/gare/monaco%20monte-carlo.aspx ) to go back home ;-), 
  and this nutjob is able to own guns ? 
  french citizens can live in monaco but they still have to pay their taxes in france . 
  they can not have the resident status . 
  so really it 's worthless . 
  why living in monaco when a few kilometres away housing are cheaper and bigger . 
  oh yes , very nice indeed . 
  `` das boot '' is among my top three german 's movie , with `` der untergang '' and `` die blechtrommel '' , `` good bye , lenin ! '' is not far away ;-), 
   i 'd love to watch french movies , i just do n't know where to find them . 
  i know where to find us 's movies !, 
  everywhere in the world , except in north korea maybe :-d, 
  tell me how many german 's movies you know and italians or spanish !, 
  i 'm happy to agree with an english for once ( do n't tell / r/rugbyunion ),
