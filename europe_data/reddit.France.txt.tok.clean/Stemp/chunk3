  i 'm sorry if i offended you , i 'm joking with a ~ ~ rosbif ~ ~ english gentleman . 
  but , still , iparralde is in france . 
  the modern celts we have came from great britain to little britain ( aka bretagne ) . 
  and we had some greeks and romans in south-east . 
  but the main difference is we have basques and you do n't :-), 
  hummm , celts then germanic 's invasions , then viking 's invasions of the coast . 
  remind me of another country , but i forgot which one :-p, 
  tldnr : he is pissed by the greek government lies .

  i 'm not religious and i dislike religions , but it 's better to have leaders of religions with sensible views rather than an extremist .

  well if you think obama is too leftist , i guess sweden is not for you .

  and avoid your family and your so 's family .

  manouches and gitans are not the same as the roms coming for romania , bulgaria and ex-yugoslavia .
