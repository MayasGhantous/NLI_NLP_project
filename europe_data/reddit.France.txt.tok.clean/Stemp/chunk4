   concerning the flemish . . meh . . huuu ? 
  that 's great , i also heard james may is going to be the new editor-in-chief of vogue . 
  nope , it 's bienven\u00fce :-p, 
  french : [ bienvenue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/fr-bienvenue.ogg ) parisian 's french : ... 
  it 's already a [ d\u00e9partement ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a9man_%28d%c3%a9partement%29 ) !, 
  [ probably one of these kids ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=robajwplxpa ),

   go peddle your russia-apologetics somewhere else . 
  just imagine the russian navy doing an exercice in the north sea , 130 km from ostende with a nuclear capable vessel . 
  do n't get me wrong , flying 20 meters over a destroyer is crazy dangerous , but this training was also a message to russia from the us/poland . 
  yes , sure , we 'll think about it as soon as you send the horses of saint mark back to turkey . 
  from other newspaper :  70 nautical miles from kaliningrad in the baltic sea . 
  the provocation goes both way . 
  the french is wrong , firstly because there is not a traditional dress for france and secondly because these are medieval dress probably from a joan of arc 's festival . 
  btw belgium is also wrong , this is the [ gilles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gilles ) from the carnival of binche . 
  france : kaysersberg, 
  martin 2 . 
  dubois ( from the wood ) 4 . 
  thomas 5 . 
  robert 6 . 
  richard 7 . 
  petit ( small little ) 8 . 
  durand ( from endurant : tought ) 9 . 
  leroy ( the king ) 10 . 
  moreau ( dark skin ), 
  yes [ he ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfumw_mf5qc ) does , you do n't agree ? 
  at first i thought it was just good taste , but they prefer the english even more . 
  so it must be something else . 
  what is this gay propaganda doing in this subreddit ? 
  [ here is the real version !!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koqb8vb4bla ), 
  pasqua with italians from paris . 
  i 'm full . 
  ca n't even look at the pastiera . 
  let 's go to the [ pitxuri ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlpzs5bvoik ) to celebrate !, 
   saint-jean-le-blanc - albijohanicien it 's not really weird , it 's pedantic . 
  latin name + ien or ain . 
  others exemples : * fontainebleau : bellifontains * cahors : cadurciens, 
  i remember watching this on tv with my serbian 's friends in paris . 
  it was a very sad experience . 
  the special bond between serbia and france died these days . 
  for your own safety , do n't tell a corsican he is italian . 
  to tell them they are french is pretty risky , but italian , it 's suicidal :-), 
  mainly `` revolutionary taxes '', 
  why ? 
  you want another ( but smaller ) sicily ? 
  extremely underrated : come and see paris , the only city in france . 
  beautiful and full of history . 
  saint-tropez the only beach in france . 
  les 2 alpes , the only ski resort in france . 
  mont saint michel , the only island and abbey in france . 
  i 've heard of the some other places , but trust me , there is nothing to see . 
  you 're not welsh !, 
  what do you know about st. patty ? 
   plus an islamist `` already well known to the anti-terrorism '' all of them were in the `` s '' files ( terrorism ) . 
  the islamist was sent to jail in 2014 ( for 5 years ) and , of course , was released last october . 
   he has never announced russia 's intention to bomb any target in syria except the islamic state . 
  wrong , russia always talked about terrorist groups . 
  from the syrian government point of view it 's basically everybody . 
  do n't ban bullfighting , just ban the first `` tercio '' ( the part when horsemen jab the bull with a lance ) . 
  the bullfighting will end really fast with the death of all the torero . 
  yes , but it 's not a french dialect it 's a ligurian language . 
  basque of course , it 's the only truly european language :-), 
  in front of the saint-lazare 's station in paris, 
   and he drinks earl grey all the time . 
  if the americans are doing the coffee , i will drink tea too . 
  yeah !!, 
  rafale are on their way . 
  flics , poulets ( chickens ) , keuf , cond\u00e9 , schmitt ( and many others ), 
  from portugal : bacalhau \u00e0 z\u00e9 do pipo from catalonia : sarsuela from italy ( marche ) : porchetta and oliva ascolana from serbia , greece ( and other ) : burek / spanakopita from england : beef wellington from belgium : carbonade flamande ( i 'm cheating here , it 's also french , but it 's too good to be left out ) . 
  wow , you 're so kind . 
  my so usually reply with sentences in italian i do n't understand but are apparently not very kind :-d, 
  is it the right place to talk about spaghetti bolognese ? 
  according to my so , it 's 500g per person and by meal ( including breakfast ) . 
  so it should be for 2 weeks :-d, 
  a french novelist ( courteline ) did the same , but he paid his co-worker to do his job . 
  he only stopped when he became famous . 
  not 6 years but 14 !, 
   mallarm\u00e9 and g\u00e9rard de nerval spelled it `` n\u00e9nufar '' . 
  -- ( chateaubriand , atala , 1801 ), 
  are they insane ? 
  we use bosquet ( grove ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikis9ztvbpg ) in 2007, 
  you 're right , it kinda make me feel [ patriotic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napol%c3%a9on,_prince_imperial ) :-), 
  it does n't make me feel patriotic but make me [ thirsty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exhaodmoqb4 ) and make me want to go to [ bayonne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfn3ppy48yq ) . 
   his mother is italian swiss in fact but from ticino ( italian 's speaking ) . 
   and the french just reach for a bed sheet . 
  tell me who were the last to invade switzerland and to defeat the swiss ? 
  hmmmm ... 
  the cheese eating surrender monkeys \\ o /, 
  go back to school and learn about flanders !!, 
  i 'm a proud flemish and f ** k you, 
   the plagiarized flemish flag excuse me ? 
   in france , the counterpart to mr trump is the far-right national front ( fn ) . 
  comparing marine le pen to donald trump is just plain stupid . 
   now imagine someone would warn a jew that it was n't a `` good idea '' to wear a kippah in parliament or a christian to wear a cross . 
  i can imagine it , because it 's most likely to happen . 
  religious symbols are frown upon in public buildings . 
  and it 's the parliament .
