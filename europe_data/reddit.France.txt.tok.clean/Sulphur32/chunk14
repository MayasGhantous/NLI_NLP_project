  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japan_air_self-defense_force#aircraft_inventory ) overall their military is very strong , especially considering the fact that it is used in a purely defensive role . 
   if the loss of trade relations is more costly to a foreign power than the value of potential loot from an invasion , they wo n't attack . 
  it 's game theory . 
  this assumes that all actors on the world stage ( including non-state organisations ) act rationally , and that their interests automatically coincide with maintaining the global economy status quo . 
  this is a fatally flawed assumption that has led to many of the foreign policy failures we 've seen over the past two decades . 
  russia 's carrier is a piece of junk that can only put to sea with a tug for when it breaks down , so i would n't count them in that class . 
   british defence chiefs have always been privately in favour of developing a joint european army , navy and air force what ? 
  so will hutton , a man who is best known for writing opinion columns on economic matters ( opposing cuts and in favour of increased banking regulation ) can just write something like that without any sourcing whatsoever ? 
  that 's a very bold claim to make in such an offhand manner , for someone who has shown no insider knowledge of the military before . 
   the future allegedly lies in china , despite the fact that a chinese spring -- and associated turmoil -- is drawing closer . 
  i guess hutton has a crystal ball , or maybe some gypsy magic , he seems to be able to predict the future with absolute certainty . 
  it 's possible that china might see some revolts against communist party rule , but to state that like its some kind of inevitability is stupid . 
  many european countries have shown time and time again that they are unwilling to make a serious commitment to both their own defence and that of europe while the usa , france and the uk guarantee it for them [ ^ 1 ] ( http://www.aviationweek.com/blogs.aspx?plckblogid=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckpostid=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7post:3746e462-d9f3-43bd-90d2-769ec8209630 ) . 
  they 're perfectly happy to make token contributions to joint operations such as those in libya and afghanistan while the logistical and intelligence aspects are taken care of for them , but i 've yet to see any evidence that a joint european force would lead to a situation other than france and the uk carrying a disproportionate share of costs and any combat casualties [ ^ 2 ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2009/11/13/1258112710564/info-is-beautiful-08-001.jpg ) . 
  the difficulties of integrating so many different forces , with different languages and operating cultures , would at least in the medium term provide more problems than it would solve . 
  both france [ ^ 3 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ivory-coast-strongman-arrested-after-french-forces-intervene/2011/04/11/afobaekd_story.html ) and the uk [ ^ 4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_palliser ) have shown in the past that they are able to take action to secure their interests , albeit in a limited fashion . 
  i do n't disagree with hutton that defence cuts will reduce this capability , but i do n't see how they are so crippling that the two nations will be utterly unable to do so in the future . 
  this downgrade might even be a positive thing , reducing the temptation to engage in disastrous adventurism like the iraq war . 
  i especially do n't understand how combining resources with countries who have next to no ability ( or desire , in fact ) to project power would solve this issue . 
  a lot of federal europe / combined eu military proponents seem to have a desire for their country and the eu itself to punch above its weight , competing on equal terms with the usa and china . 
  but france and the uk already punch above their weight , and recognise that attempting to compete with the usa and china on their own terms is a futile exercise . 
  we neither want nor feel the need to match these two nations , whose economies are vastly larger than our own , blow for blow . 
  that sort of mentality would harm , not help europe . 
  edit : considering i took the time to write all this junk , could the downvoters at least explain why they disagree and contribute to the discussion ? 
  thanks to the eu human rights laws that / r/europe [ got so angry at the uk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/qaz0z/uk_presses_for_european_human_rights_convention/ ) for being skeptical about . 
  no need to pay attention to that guy . 
  shit , i guess i 'm an outlier then . 
  maybe it 's because denmark and france are very different countries , and the so called ` french model ' has n't even been that successful over here . 
  i always love it when people from countries which have like 4 black people between them get all hot and bothered trying to tell us all these things we simply must do to deal with minorities in our societies . 
  they do n't all speak english , so what if they use the same slogans ... ? 
  these protests do n't necessarily reflect the majority attitude in these countries . 
  there was a funny tweet going around earlier about some protesters asking a wedding party for some fireworks for their protest , the wedding goers told them to piss off . 
  i agree . 
  the post that 's on the frontpage right now about americans apparently ` worshipping ' their soldiers is the most cringeworthy circlejerk i 've seen in a while . 
  there 's no discussion whatsoever , just blanket bashing of americans and soldiers in general . 
  i find that really , really annoying too . 
   right , and scotland is one of the richest parts of the uk . 
   scotland is basically bang on average ... what ? 
  so brave, 
  this subreddit really , really does n't like radical islam and unfortunately this often leads to misguided people hating on muslims generally . 
  i guess its understandable if all you know about muslims are the very worst news stories ( i.e. 
  muslim kids stabbing rabbis , honour killings etc ) . 
  bear in mind most people in this subreddit do n't know many , if any muslims personally and so are bound to have this skewed version of the religion and its adherents . 
  i 'm friends with and grew up with loads of perfectly normal muslims so its very obvious to me that the nutters you 'll read about in the papers are a definite minority , but i guess for people from mostly white areas things are n't so clear . 
  the premise of this article is 100 % based on [ this article . 
  ] ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_32231_01/09/2012_459307 ) it offers no evidence whatsoever , no sourcing , all it says is that the troika `` are said to be worried about cuts to public administration and defence '' . 
  smells like bullshit to me . 
   up to four million bengalis starved to death in 1943 after winston churchill diverted food to well-fed british soldiers and countries such as greece . 
  come on now . 
  while this is partly true , it 's silly to ignore the impact of the democratically elected local governments , who had been given the authority to limit food exports to to famine hit areas . 
  in fact , [ ` the government of india act 1935 had removed most of the government of india 's authority over the provinces , so they had to rely on negotiation . 
  ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943_bengal_famine#government_inaction )  harvard historian caroline elkins as `` britain 's gulag '' . 
  estimates of deaths vary widely ; historian david anderson puts the death toll at 20,000 , but elkins believes up to 100,000 could have died . 
  elkins 's research is very much disputed among historians . 
  presenting her work as accepted orthodoxy is misleading and poor journalism imo . 
  no one is disputing colonialism was awful , simply by its nature it is reprehensible . 
  i do n't understand why so many insist on trumping up certain atrocities to suit their narrative , all it does is diminish the actual reasons why colonialism has been consigned to the dustbin of history . 
  edit the op of this thread appears to have an ulterior motive , seems like he posts in / r/whiterights . 
   you realise the notion of a nation state arised in the 19th century ? 
  that 's a ridiculous blanket statement . 
  at least provide some justification . 
   it does however show that european countries need to be leashed by a central authority you mean the completely undemocratic european commission ? 
  why is it a good idea to give it power over democratic national governments ? 
   they 've been a partypooper for the eu since a long time . 
  do me a favour why do n't you . 
  it 's perfectly natural for any country to act in what they believe is their interest . 
  i hate this attitude that the rest of the eu can decide what is best for the uk , and if its government doesnt go along with greater european integration they 're somehow spoiling it for everyone . 
  he is n't swedish . 
  it 's not corruption as would be measured by most international metrics ( bribery , embezzlement etc ) its more misuse of public funds . 
  a lot of people play it in school over here in the uk but there isnt a big professional scene . 
  i 'm afraid you are n't going to get the average european 's view on this subreddit . 
  that 's more like throwing a cia agent into a bond villain 's shark tank, 
  everyone tends to dogpile on uk users here, 
  the war 's already going on , whether we like it or not . 
  islamism is n't inherently bad . 
  for example turkey 's ruling part is moderately islamist , and they 've succeeded in fostering rapid economic growth . 
  yeah , that test is far better , nice find .

  bashing the uk is this subreddit 's favourite pastime . 
  some seem to take being sceptical about europe as a personal insult . 
  wonder if germany will be on board this time . 
  obviously france and the uk would undertake most military operations , but the german intelligence service is one of if not the most well informed on syria , and germany 's support could go a long way in securing a un resolution . 
  it 's kind of pointless to compare the economies these countries . 
  they differ vastly in size , and each one has individual problems to deal with . 
  that does n't apply here . 
  yeah , if you are n't using an oyster card . 
  which you should be . 
  i see . 
  well , do carry on old bean . 
  shameless self promotion on their part . 
  i wish people would stop posting about this bullshit . 
   you 're all exceptionalists . 
  that 's a good thing imo . 
  the former . 
  of course the police can request a warrant to view private cctv footage if a crime 's been committed , for example if someone 's been mugged in front a shop which has cctv . 
  the ira detonated a bomb at the houses of parliament in the 1970s , actually . 
  we just do n't like this sanctimonious attitude you have if it wants to .
