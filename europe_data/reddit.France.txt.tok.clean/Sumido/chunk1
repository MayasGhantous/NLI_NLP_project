also the hyper cacher incident and the suspicious guy who tried to climb the eiffel tower with a backpack, 
  he 's a florida man, 
   there have been hundreds of arrests and convictions and the guys remaining do not stop taking bribes . 
  i 'm not sure the replacements are bound to be more careful or fearful . 
  not adopt it but adapt to it . 
  right now it feels like we 're the ones that have to change our ways to suit them . 
  i dunno , never had it . 
  just looks ... deadly . 
  [ we 've got a similar thing in france , in terms of black edible stuff .

  what was the proposal ? 
  61.28 % no with 50 % of votes reported . 
  i love you iceland < 3, 
  these ` kisses ' ( called ` bises ' ) are actually just touching cheeks with a very light kissing sound . 
  although , i 've noticed some girls give a subtle kiss on the cheek with their lips , on the last ` bise ' , if they like you . 
  very cute . 
  funny at first but it seems so exaggerated, 
  not refugee camps , [ these kinds of cities ] ( http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2009/06/1233695909-18_4011702.jpg ), 
  and then they have kids who grow up dirt poor and resent the country for making their family live in such conditions . 
  crime goes up . 
   * super expensive everything, 
  skinny and moody . 
  perfect description of the young parisian female . 
  '' this implies that the state is the only means of achieving organization in society when that is n't the case at all '' source ? 
  examples ? 
  i 've been going to calais 4x a years for 25 years now . 
  a lot of it has just been fortified , you can see it in the video @ 8:20 . 
  that was n't there just 2 years ago . 
  you 've just pointed out the problem . 
  sharia law and police do exist but not in that country . 
  therefore should not be tolerated . 
  i 'm done with this debate . 
  new laws are voted in all the time . 
  impersonating a law enforcement officer of an actual legal system should absolutely be banned . 
  `` uniforms '' that mean `` i reject your laws and want to impose my own barbaric laws '' . 
  laws that are applied right now in the most barbaric countries . 
  perfectly fine . 
  would wearing a `` nazi police '' or `` daesh police '' be perfectly acceptable as well ? 
  except one is clearly a joke and the other is terrifying . 
  `` shariah police '' do you know what that stands for ? 
  it 's far from `` fashion police '' . 
  the message is very clear . 
  except these individuals are actively trying to dismantle democracy . 
  should we accept that because it 's their right ? 
  south and west are richer than the north and east . 
  but it 's gentrifying at a very fast pace . 
  thanks for the tip but it 's part of who i am and i would never change it . 
  no , but i sure as hell ai n't revealing my very unique and rare name on reddit . 
  that did n't save me from having a stupid name . 
  til protesting funerals = cooking food, 
  bout time we grew some balls . 
  we had the biggest balls in the world until they shriveled up to nothing for some reason . 
  `` huh , turns out all these ` islamophobes ' were right . 
  latest trend i 've noticed is wearing a surgical mask with their hijab . 
  it 's creeping into france as well, 
   islam is one of the biggest religions in asia confirming my point . 
  i never said muslims are bellicose . 
  i said islam is . 
  it 's just a fact , all the sacred texts call for eternal jihad . 
  expanding territory to `` spread the message of allah '' when in reality it was only designed to enrich the caliphate . 
  it was not intended to be summary but a statement of fact . 
  a fact that is indeed one part of the problem . 
  you 're wrong . 
  islam is inherently bellicose and is based on eternal expansion . 
  i can do that, 
  that was funny but possible the most infuriating format to follow a conversation/fight . 
   this is not the first terrorist attack we endured this is why you get less support . 
  i do n't mean this in a mean or derogatory way , it 's just fact . 
  it 's very rare to see terrorist attacks in europe so it 's seen as much more tragic than in countries where it seems like a daily occurrence . 
   weather : rain, 
  pretty design but the crooked `` nordica '' is unfortunate, 
  are you crazy ? 
  no dutch or germans ? 
  best place ever !, 
  nope, 
  because there are other countries nearby . 
  remember , i 'm fleeing for my life, 
  if my home country is in ruins , sweden would n't be my first , second or even third choice . 
  ca n't think of a single country with integration problems where people speak the language . 
  except maybe france , england and germany but those are small countries . 
   it 's absolutely obvious that she is no friend of the eu i never said she was, 
   interviewer jean-jacques bourdin asked ms le pen outright : `` do you wish for france to leave the european union ? 
  so that things are clear , i 'm asking you directly - yes or no ? ''   ms le pen replied : `` no , i think we need to renegotiate with the eu because i want to see french sovereignty restored in france , supported by a referendum . '' how many times will i need to repeat myself ? 
  say what you want , she does n't . 
  the media says she does but her words say otherwise . 
  she wants to renegotiate deals , nothing new here . 
  [ long french read ] ( https://www.upr.fr/actualite/france-europe/front-national-sortie-de-l-ue-sorite-de-l-euro ), 
  i do n't think , i read her programme and watched many , many interviews . 
   trump would n't have won i 'm not so sure about that . 
  you guys always underestimate him and lose pathetically every time . 
  they think that right-wing politicians are gon na round up the gays to put them in camps or something . 
  they are completely detached from reality and live in a delusional fantasy land . 
  i know her position very well . 
  that not it . 
  at all . 
  what frexit ? 
  who 's making assumptions now ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they do n't really like gays but when i told them they literally shrugged and said they do n't care .
