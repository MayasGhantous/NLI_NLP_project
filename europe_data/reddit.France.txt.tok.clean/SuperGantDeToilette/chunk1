  napoleon was 100 meters tall and dinosaurs were 200 meters . 
  this is historically accurate napoleon was riding dinosaurs historians says . 
   for exemple la r\u00e9union and martinique are fully part of the french republic , while nouvelle caledonie and french polynesia are basically colonies . 
  wtf ? 
  fyi : france is not in usa, 
  i 've never seen one . 
  reddit is full of americans that know nothing about france , but thinks they know france more than french peoples . 
  and occitanie ... * / facepalm *, 
  it 's not syria , it 's iraq . 
  fsa flag is green , not red . 
  edit : [ here it is ] ( http://orig12.deviantart.net/f516/f/2012/024/b/2/syria_flag_by_waheed6808-d4ngihd.jpg ) fsa in on putin 's left, 
  this is iraq . 
  in french raf is a slang for rien \u00e0 foutre ( i do n't give a shit ) . 
  that 's not related to the hippocratic oath . 
  do n't touch a guy wearing a bomb !, 
  the bomber still had a bomb on him , and we know that it had n't worked as expected ( only one side of the bomb exploded ) , that 's why he just killed himself , and he was n't transformed into * salsa pomodoro * . 
  the nurse could have trigger the bomb by manipulating his corpse . 
  he speaks french pretty well , though . 
  u no the boss of my kboard, 
  noraj de not ' gagnage, 
  french wikipedia have a very cool article [ `` public holidays in the european union '' ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/jours_f%c3%a9ri%c3%a9s_dans_l%27union_europ%c3%a9enne ) that shows holidays per eu country . 
  there is 2 holiday which is the same everywhere christmas and new year day . 
  wow , thats about 0,12 % of population of croatia !, 
  i 've seen comments before they get removed and they were all americans . 
  i said 5 times that my source is the ushmm . 
  what is your source to say that `` these numbers are exaggerated by over 100 % '' . 
  your `` source '' is `` history of the jews in serbia '' , the 33000 you quote is about serbia . 
  you know that yugoslavia and serbia is not the same thing ... right ? 
  and your `` source '' also says : `` of the ** 82,500 jews of yugoslavia alive in 1941 ** , only 14,000 survived the holocaust '' . 
  there were jews but i did n't found any data . 
  this map is not about eu . 
  state can give exceptional permission . 
  most of the sources i have found say 3200 . 
  your mom farted they all died, 
  i did n't found estimation . 
  only people calling themselves jews . 
  1933 data are from the united states holocaust memorial museum . 
  1933 data are from united states holocaust memorial museum . 
  yes , it opened in late 2013 . 
  yes , 5 years ago they lauched a petition to build a synagogue . 
   rukusenburuku ( ~ \u25bd ) ~, 
  no , she will lose against anyone . 
  there is no way she get 50 % of the voices , that 's why this is basically a one round election , the person at the second round who is not marine le pen will be elected . 
  source and more stats ( in french obviously ) : http://www.ifop.fr/media/poll/3668-1-study_file.pdf ps : 2nd round macron 61 % , le pen 39 % . 
  ... like harry potter ? 
  since eu anthem do n't have lyrics , it will be hard . 
  # * keg keep europe great, 
  polls say othewise . 
  this is not what the article is talking about . 
  pdf conserve the layers of images that have been saved with photoshop so when you open the image in the pdf with illustrator you can see this is a fake made in illustrator .

  that 's total bullshit . 
  first trump had less voices than clinton , he won because of electoral college , so polls were right . 
  second the last week before brexit polls were in average at 50-50 with a lot of undecided . 
  on these photos the older is m\u00e9lenchon who is 20 . 
  easy to predict . 
  it was by far the most probable second round . 
  i think he was a little bit older . 
  that 's right . 
  yes but she 's a lot uglier now . 
  the last time she did a score this low it was 4 years ago . 
  edit : i 'm stupid that 's the title of the post, 
  yes , the only possibility of second round she can possibly ( but very unlikely ) win is against fillon and there 's a few chance they both go the second round . 
  to stay short : he 's the candidate of the catholic pro-life homophobic elderies . 
  no it 's a 2 rounds election , the 2 first of the first round go the second then we vote again . 
  fillon is more super conservative moderate liberal . 
  less than 1 third have `` sympathy '' . 
  macron and le pen are leading in polls . 
  there is a second round with the 2 first candidates of the first round . 
  poles are known to hate russia . 
  easy : m\u00e9lenchon is good , hamon is catastrophicaly bad . 
  as well the ps have a very bad image , and the most centrist wing of the party joined macron . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is against the sanctions against russia , he is often labeled as pro-russia . 
  and he want to accept refugees . 
  according to [ depuis1958 ] ( https://depuis1958.fr/ ) 's analysis there is almost 70 % of chance this scenario happen . 
  probability | second round | probability of victory -- | -- | -- 69.5 % | macron vs le pen | macron =  100.0 % 9.0 % | macron vs m\u00e9lenchon | macron =  99.5 % 8.8 % | macron vs fillon | macron =  100.0 % 6.1 % | m\u00e9lenchon vs le pen | m\u00e9lenchon =  100.0 % 6.0 % | fillon vs le pen | fillon =  99.0 %, 
  i 'm very suprised that 31 % have sympathy for russians , and only the 5th most hated . 
  i would have thought them to be at the very bottom of the chart . 
  do n't bilieve tablo\u00efds le pen can not win . 
  second round `` beat '' order can we summarized like this : macron  m\u00e9lenchon  fillon  le pen . 
  for le pen it mean that : macron vs le pen =  macron win fillon vs le pen =  fillon win m\u00e9lenchon vs le pen =  m\u00e9lenchon win, 
  call me / u/supergantdetoilette . 
  people that liked him because he was funny in the debates finally read his programme . 
  poutou and arthaud are anticapitalists and their foreign programme can be summarized as '' [ remove all the borders ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/006/199/x-all-the-y.jpg ) '' . 
  hamon has a hard limit of 5 % of people who will vote ps whatever happens . 
  m\u00e9lenchon rise is already over and i think he will fade a little bit in the next days and stay at about 17-18 % . 
  fillon and m\u00e9lenchon are the most opposed candidates in the race . 
  and i fear m\u00e9lenchon more than le pen . 
  [ macron - le pen second round ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election%2c_2017_macron%e2%80%93le_pen.png ) source : [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017 ), 
  actually he was at almost 30 % before penelopegate . 
  the guy looking at the camera make me feel uncomfortable , look like he 's judging me . 
  we do n't know anymore , the polls results have changed a lot since 2 or 3 weeks and [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/evolution_des_intentions_de_vote_%c3%a0_l%27%c3%a9lection_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_2017.png/800px-evolution_des_intentions_de_vote_%c3%a0_l%27%c3%a9lection_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_2017.png ) is happening . 
  the tendance is clear : they are all merging to one point . 
  and for some reasons a lot of people fear that fillon is underestimated and macron overestimated . 
  so we do n't know the outcome , we ca n't know who will be to the second round , it can be macron and le pen or fillon and m\u00e9lenchon or other combinaisions . 
  never a french election has been so crazy and so unpredictable . 
  the old politic system is breathless and all the candidats have very different politic visions and for 3 of them would engage radicals and opposite changes . 
  french politic history is to a crossroad , and we have no idea of the outcome . 
  poor choices in vote .
