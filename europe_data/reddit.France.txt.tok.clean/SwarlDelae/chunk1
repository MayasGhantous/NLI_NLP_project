they usually are [ rather big stores ] ( http://www.helexia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/centrale-photovolta\u00efque-helexia-leroy-merlin.jpg ) , in commercial areas around mid-sized and big cities . 
  they 're called brico d\u00e9p\u00f4t or leroy merlin * ( or even saint-maclou , castorama or ikea if you 're very generous with the term `` hardware store '' ) * , look like [ industrial depots ] ( http://www.philips.com/consumerfiles/newscenter/main/shared/assets/fr/newscenter/press/brico-depot/brico-depot-1lrg.jpg ) , and have a drive-thru just outside [ for big things you 're not going to put in a shopping cart ] ( http://www.rennes.maville.com/shopping/sites/maville.com.shopping/files/styles/normale/public/field/image/commerce/15-07-06/img_1619_0.jpg?itok=vxp8o91o ) . 
  trade the union of england and wales for [ north sentinel island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sentinel_island ) . 
  they are both islands inhabited by people that do not want anything to do with us anyways , but north sentinel island is way smaller , so we might actually get direct boats to scotland and skip the middle man . 
  in france , you do n't need a driver 's licence to drive a scooter , just a bsr ( or am driver 's licence ) . 
  it 's way easier and cheaper to get , so that 's a good option for some people . 
  | driver 's licence | bsr -- | -- | -- ** minimum age ** | 18 y.o. 
  | 14 y.o. 
  * ** cost ( average ) ** | 1200 $ | 150 $ ** course duration ( average ) ** | 35h | 7h -- \\* ^ ( though you need to have done your jdc - a mandatory day of propaganda by the french army , created so that they can recruit young people despite conscription being abolished - which is usually done at 16y . o. . ), 
  there , try these subreddits : * / r/france * / r/alsace ( oh , it 's dead ) * / r/strasbourg, 
  i 'm posting from a phone , so i do n't have prices in mind . 
  i 'll add things later , but here 's something in case you want to start planing right away . 
  well i guess you could go for france first and last ( plane ticket should be less if you arrive and depart from the same airport , and the two airports you 're sure to have flights to from anywhere in the world are paris cdg and london heathrow ) . 
  you could add three neighbouring countries ( out of belgium , germany , switzerland , italy , spain and ireland . 
  i purposely left out luxembourg and andorra : they are small , you should not go there with a 4-countries ticket ) . 
  if i had that kind of opportunity , i would first spend one day in paris , two if you like museums and want to see the louvres . 
  if i had to do paris in a day , i 'd do notre dame , montmartre and le marais . 
  add the eiffel tower , because even if it 's overrated as fuck , you 'll look like a moron back home if you went to paris and did not get a photo of it . 
  then i 'll go to normandy . 
  because it 's pretty . 
  head to the saint lazare train station , and take a train to caen ( or a train to cherbourg , they stop in caen ) . 
  the trip takes 2h . 
  in caen , you 'll see what a beautiful french city look like , filled with a medieval castle , fucktons of churches , nice houses and restaurants , and nice parks . 
  there is also the biggest world war 2 museum , le m\u00e9morial de caen , if you 're into that . 
  then take a train to cherbourg . 
  trip takes 1h12 optional stop in bayeux , where you can see a cathedral , the bayeux tapestry , and take a bus to the dday beaches . 
  in cherbourg , you are waiting for a boat that will take you to ireland !, 
  waiting for the boat , you can visit la cit\u00e9 de la mer , a big museum about the sea . 
  the two highlights of the museum are a whole exhibition on the titanic with a heartbreaking room shaped like the front of the boat with a giant screen showing the sea and entries from passengers ' diaries and boat 's telegraphs . 
  then the iceberg comes out of nowhere and ypu can live minute by minute the distress of everyone with the soss sent and the replies from other boats . 
  still moves me two years after visiting it . 
  the other highlight of the museum is that you can visit a real nuke-launching submarine . 
  so now you took the boat to ireland . 
  eurail website says you get a massive discount for this boat with your pass . 
  ( there is n't a boat everyday , plan accordingly ! ) . 
  what do you do in ireland ? 
  i have no fucking clue , i never went there , ask an irishman . 
  when you 're done with ireland , take the boat back to cherbourg , take a train to caen , but stop at lison and take a train to rennes . 
  stop at pontorson : here is le mont saint michel , sometimes nicknamed eight wonder of the world !, 
  then i guess you could go to rennes . 
  and take a train to the south . 
  you ca n't see a lot of beautiful things in brittany unless you have a car . 
  try saint-malo of you need to fill in gaps in your trip , but unless you rent a car , not much else to see . 
  i do n't know enough about the rest of europe ( except for scandinavia ) to do it justice , so i wo n't do something as detailed . 
  you have all of southern france to visit . 
  i would absolutely go to italy too . 
  that leaves you with one other country . 
  i would do all of italy then take a discounted boat to greece . 
  but if you have enough antiquity things in italy , i 'd go to austria . 
  so france ireland france italy [ greece - austria ] italy france . 
  but that 's just what i 'd do . 
  are there things that please you in this draft . 
  could you please give us some of your group 's interests ? 
  you could even reply with `` tags '' ( for instance `` churches , world war ii , italian food , cows , sailing , computers '' ) . 
  it would greatly help us direct you to routes relevant to your interests . 
  edit : number of days you plan on staying and approximate budget would be cool too . 
  edit 2 : also which country do you come from ? 
  ( this could influence which airport we tell you to go to ), 
  it seems you can not go to gb with eurail . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.eurail.com/europe-by-train ) edit : with further reading , you can take the eurostar from paris to london , and get back on the same train , but you can not take british trains while in the uk . 
  edit 2 : with further reading , `` eurostar is not included in the eurail pass , but a special fare is available . '', 
  wow , at least the few preachers we have in france ( jehova 's witnesses mostly ) give bibles away for free ... buying them ? 
  really ? 
  i live in france . 
  though christianism left traces everywhere ( [ see for instance this eleventh century church just outside my window ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cxapjgn.jpg ) ) , absolutely no one believes in `` god '' . 
  most people are n't religious at all , and the scarce people that still believe in something ( < 10 % of the population ) do believe in a concept , a set of tacit rules that supposedly makes everyone 's life better ( you should not kill , you should not bang your neighbor 's wife , a family is a father and a mother , and so on ) , and not that there is a guy somewhere in the sky that watches you fap . 
  people that still go to mass on sundays usually do it for the community , to see other people you might not be able to see otherwise in the week . 
  we stopped taking the bible in a literal way centuries ago . 
  i was raised in a catholic school ( in france there are 36 930 catholic classes as opposed to 246 335 non-catholic ones ) , and even my catechesis teacher were emphasizing that what is written in the bible are parables , that jesus did not make fish and bread magically appear , but that he shared stuff he had ; that jesus giving the other cheek was a way of saying `` try to stop conflict instead of feeding the troll '' ... 
  they even had us read some passages of the leviticus to make us realize that everyone in the classroom would have to be stoned to death if we took a book for law . 
  even the most hardcore christian in europe most likely takes the theory of evolution for a fact , as much as he believes that the theory of gravity is a fact too . 
  the only things where and when we see religiousness all over everything are for instance when gay marriage was voted last year , but no one was saying `` god hates fag '' or things like that : most religious people were expressing concerns about how gay families would fit in with the rest of society ( for instance , in schools , children usually do a gift for their mothers on mother 's day and a gift for their fathers on father 's day . 
  what about children that have two mothers or two fathers ? 
  would n't that disturb children to have to call a father a mother or a mother a father ? 
  and so on ) . 
  and , even as a guy which is all for gay marriage being allowed , i think most of those are valid points , at least points we should take care about . 
  all in all , religious people are seen as harmless grandpas . 
  it 's nice to have them around , with all their conservatism and all . 
  and even though in the end the younger generations ( laics ) will most likely win the debates , it 's nice to have heard their arguments before , as they think of the welfare of the community before the welfare of individuals , which is something to take care about . 
  but no one would ever think of putting an old grandpa in a school or at the head of a state , for instance . 
  and on the reverse , normandy is not on the map while it as a pretty strong autonomist movement ( but not an independantist one ) . 
  each time this kind of map shows up on / r/mapporn , everyone is reacting on how wrong they are , and come to the conclusion that the sub should team up and make a good one . 
  and each time nothing gets done , 
  if you mean demographic growth , here is a list including all the cities . 
  www.toutes-les-villes.com/villes-croissance.html edit : key is : * number * city * growth in ten years ( % ) * population ( inh . ), 
  * national rank, 
  you 're lucky they even accepted it . 
  most shops look at you angrily if you pay with 100 $ notes , and just refuse payments with 200 and 500 $ notes . 
  order in which to do things , according to [ diplomatie.gouv.fr ] ( http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/venir-en-france-22365/formalites-d-entree-en-france/article/quel-type-de-visa-solliciter ) : * find yourself a job in france before you go * your employer will have to declare that he 's going to hire a foreigner to his local d.i.r.e.c.c.t.e. 
  * you will then be able to get a foreign job authorization * this authorization is required to be able to create a work visa coming from the us , you should have no problems getting your work visa as long as you can find a job there first . 
  remote jobs and such are subjected to the exact same rules . 
  also , i hope you can french . 
  otherwise , ** good . 
  f * cking . 
  luck . 
  from france , university of caen ( normandy ) : * you are required by law to have your id card at all times with you , anywhere . 
  * policemen can check your id whenever and wherever they deem necessary * ( i must be unworthy of checking since i never actually got id checked ) * . 
  * however , policemen can not enter on university grounds unless invited to do so by the president of the university . 
  * * a private security company is present at all times at the university , but they ca n't legally force you to id check . 
  they are here for peacekeeping and dissuading thieves and graffers .
