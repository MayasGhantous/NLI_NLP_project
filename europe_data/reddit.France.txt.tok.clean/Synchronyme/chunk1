but what kind of universal income ? 
  500 or 1000 $ / month ? 
  for everyone or just the poorest ? 
  adding to or replacing the others aids ? 
  the current proposition from hamon is n't `` universal '' at all , it 's just a kind of rsa for the 18-25yo . 
  fact : fran\u00e7ois fillon is the * only * french candidate to have posted a [ pro-eu video ] ( https://twitter.com/francoisfillon/status/845545808531406849 ) yesterday , celebrating the roma treaty and detailing his program for a stronger eu . 
  macron totaly ignored the event . 
  no ( or very few ) kids !, 
  enjoy the silence , 
  [ the world of yesterday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_world_of_yesterday ) ... really makes you wonder what europe could have been without the two ww . 
  i suggest to elect , as next german chancellor someone called `` hans italy '' , as the next spain prime minister a `` maria poland '' , in belgium a `` julie france '' etc. 
  just to mess with non-eu countries . 
  we would be invincible !, 
  the title makes it sounds like only macron condemns turkey . 
  but he was the last of the main candidate to do so !, 
  fillon and le pen did it early sunday 's morning . 
  and , as a french , i must add his claim was n't very clear at first . 
  his first answer was something like ( from memory ) `` europe should give a commun answer '' . 
  and it 's only after the journalist insisted a couple of time that he added `` yes , the turkish meeting should have been cancelled '' . 
  why do you think that , because he is a right-wing politician ? 
  he has several good ideas for a stronger eu ( boost the military/economic/scientific / politic cooperation and so on ) . 
  i do n't say he 's the best , just that he 's not the worst . 
  fillon is right-wing , like sarkozy ( or merkel ! ) . 
  he wants more europe although not with a federal one like macron , but he still wants to develop cooperation at all levels . 
  contrary to macron , fillon also wants to reduce france debt and follows eu budget rules . 
  ( if you check his program , the eu part is very detailled and interesting ! ), 
  le pen is a whole different politics : she wants to leave the euro currency , have economical and physical borders for france against the rest of the world etc. 
  so yeah , le pen would be the doom of europe . 
  fillon would be your normal right-wing politics and eu would be very fine . 
  / r/wholesomeeuropeanmemes, 
  i heard about this too late ( damn french medias and their focus on national politics ... ) but i 'll come to the next one in paris !, 
  by the way , anyone knows where i could buy an european flag ?? 
  ( in paris ), 
  fair enough, 
  the video is in 1080p . 
  well they created the party and their members like strong leadership so ... 
  ok but first i want to here italians and mongols apologized for having colonized half the world . 
  the `` charming '' and `` good looking '' terrified me when it 's about choosing your next political leader . 
  does that mean people will acclaim [ marion le pen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marion_mar%c3%a9chal-le_pen ) because she 's pretty ? 
  * `` oh sure she may deport a few people , but did you see how gorgeous she is when she smile ? 
  lol < 3 < 3 :d '' * . 
  ( hopefully macron is pro-europe and not an extremist at all , but his look should n't even be a criteria to consider ), 
  too bad renzy is n't there anymore . 
  a trio would have been interesting for europe ... 
  * cry in french * as a taxpayer i do n't want the olympics to be in paris : we already have more than 5 billions euros of debt :(, 
  one of my favorite is the 400 yo icelandic law that allowed them to kill basque people on sight . 
  it was only [ abolished in 2015 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/11635123/iceland-abolishes-law-which-orders-basques-to-be-killed-on-sight.html ) !, 
  same here in france when you start talking about the 1982 's world cup ^ ^, 
  yeah : / sadly the french medias and politics are playing the same stupid game than in the us : for the left , fillon is an ultraliberal facist , while for the right , hammon is a pro-islam and a dreamer . 
  le pen just has to stay quiet to get momentum . 
  i 'm not a macron enthusiast but i 'm glad he 's available to counter her . 
  french who vote for le pen do it for two main reasons : * tired of the establishment ( `` all politicians are the same ... '' ) * against muslims and migrants . 
  now she 's high in the polls but do n't forget it 's a 2 turns elections . 
  so she 'll probably face macron or fillon and lose 30 % / 70 % or 40 % / 60 % . 
  nobody knows macron 's plan yet , but he 's pro-europe for sure . 
   i remember seeing an old speech from after independence , an egyptian politician was giving to parliament , stating how ridiculous it was that religious hardliners wanted to cover women in veils and that it would never happen in egypt . 
  the crowd laughed , like very loudly . 
  [ president nasser , in a speech from 1950s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx4rk8bj2w0 ) . 
  those suburbs were always poor , but what 's stricking is the fact that in about 15 years , most of the women are now covered , halal shops are everywhere and there 's lost of problem with male/woman mixity ( like husband who do n't want male doctors to treat their wife ) . 
  what 's even more sad is that first wave of north africa migrants ( mostly from algeria after the end of the colony ) did n't really care about religion : they ate porc , drink wine , woman 's hair were free etc. 
  they really wanted to integrate french/european culture . 
  it 's not just the people : [ eu leaders agree plan to stop libya influx ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38850380 ) ( malta summit , last week ) . 
  those lyrics are one of the reason i just start learning german !, 
  ( the other being that most of you seem to speak fluent french and as an european i want to do my part ^ ^ ), 
  no one 's left behind , we 're a team !, 
  also japan population is 120m , france is 65m , usa is 320m . 
  so manga ( at least this one ) sell 150 times more in france than in the usa !, 
  as a french i can also confirm that most japanese animes such as miyazaki etc. 
  are big hits when they are realized in theater here . 
  well his mother is a doctor and his father a neurosurgeon ... 
  one century later , there 's a new saying : `` the most beautiful view of paris is from the [ montparnasse tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tour_montparnasse ) ... because it 's the only way to not see the montparnasse tower '' . 
  like the [ battle of the somme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_somme ) in 1916 : the british army lost ** 30.000 men ** ( killed & wounded ) ** in the first 6 minutes ** !, 
  casualities on the first day : 19.000 dead , 35.000 wounded . 
  and then you had to add german and french casualities geez ... each time i read that jrr tolkien were in those trench , i can only imagine how many artists , scientists or just good men the world could have had if they were n't killed there at 20yo . 
  sadly i think your right . 
  does n't bizmarck himself provoked the 1870 war only to created an united germany ? 
  [ metropolis ] ( http://www.planetebd.com/bd/delcourt/metropolis/-/21920.html ) by lehman and de caneva is a comic released a couple years ago : the story is set in 1934 , but in a univers where wwi never happened . 
  germany and france teams up in a single country and had build this huge , beautiful city on the border , to symbolize their union . 
  famous scientifics from all over europe are working there together etc. 
  very cool and fascinating thriller !, 
  ( only available in french though ), 
  [ this page ] ( http://antipub.org/histoire-des-baches-publicitaires-sur-les-monuments-historiques/ ) show lots of others , and recent/current examples ( in french but with lots of pictures ) . 
  one of the worst imho is the bastille statue , symbole of liberty against despotism ... currently used as a [ support for calvin klein ] ( http://antipub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/p1040739.jpg ) ads :( ( in paris , left and right politicians mostly do n't care about that , as long as money is incoming . 
  only the green party fights against it ), 
  we have the same kind of crap in paris too ( though not permanent ) : huuuuuge ads on historical monuments like [ opera garnier ] ( http://ekladata.com/dgvtgcwqmg8tgnpkdibx9qjaxiu@500x357.jpg ) or the [ orsay museum ] ( http://a137.idata.over-blog.com/500x359/0/41/70/57/affiches/affiches-baches-geantes/affiche-geante-chanel-musee-d-orsay-6085.jpg ) etc. 
  officially it 's to finance a part of the renovation works , but in practice , we end up with ads all over our beautiful city , as the renovation takes years and when it 's done , another one start :(, 
  also `` ce syst\u00e8me ne marche pas droit '' is `` this system does n't work * straight * '' , with the idea that you can tune it to make it works better , as opposed to `` this system does n't work '' which suggest you need to find a whole new system . 
  for example norway and switzerland , while not in the eu , are paying billions each years for access to the eu market ( low or no import/export taxes etc. ) . 
  how much will the uk have to pay : 10 ? 
  50 billions ? 
  that 's one of the thing uk and eu will have to decide . 
  now i kinda expect `` we suffer too '' posts with picture of finish dudes in their 90 \u00b0 saunas . 
  it 's near the rock am ring fest is n't it ? 
  too bad that wo n't stop her to be elected as a french deputy next sunday :(, 
  reminds me of the [ latin monetary union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_monetary_union ) from 1865-1920 : germany was n't included but ... greece already caused trouble ^ ^, 
  yeah and usa mess up with south america politics for decades , european countries had colonies all over asia etc. 
  yet we never see chilean or vietnamese migrants blowing themselves in our streets . 
  czech republic 's moto , `` pravda v\u00edt\u011bz\u00ed '' ( `` truth prevails '' ) , is one of my favorite ... 
  i just did n't knew it was about beers !,
