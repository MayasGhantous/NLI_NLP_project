  the marseillaise was played several times tonight at the louvres ( where his supporters are celebrating his victory ) . 
  ode to joy was played when macron came there for his speech , at 22h . 
  also french legislatives not only have two rounds , but everyone above 12.5 % is qualified for it . 
  so what will happen if , for example , all 5 party ( fn , lr-udi , em , ps , lfi ) have +15 % ? 
  maybe ps and lfi team up , maybe em and lr-udi team up ( on a zone-by-zone basis ) ... 
  if it means winning against the fn , it 's a possibility . 
  and that 's why current polls do n't mean a lot . 
  one of the policemen has third-degree burns on the face ( and this is just 10 days after the murder of another policeman on the champ-\u00c9lys\u00e9es ) . 
  those far-left protestors do n't even seem to realize that this kind of actions are a blessing for far-right le pen . 
  i only checked in french , but a quick google on `` forced veil '' show hundred of teenager girls * living in democratic , european , countries * asking stuff like `` my mum/dad/family forced me to wear a veil , how can i tell them i do n't want to ? '' . 
  imho , that 's why a law is useful , to protect ( young ) people from being pressure by their environnement . 
  it 's not an easy subject ... should we tolerate people wearing swastika or kkk tunics in the streets ? 
  after all , one could say they are just `` clothes '' . 
  usa is way more tolerant than europe about this . 
  but tbh i do n't know if one option is better than the another . 
  what if a group of people agrees to be exploited , should the society accept it ? 
  for example during centuries , indians had the [ sati ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sati_ ( practice \\ ) ) tradition : the widow has to be burnt ( alive ! ), 
  with her dead husband . 
  when england , in the 19th , banned this tradition because of european/christian values , indian widows protested !, 
  sometimes it 's soft coercion . 
  like , in french suburbs , young women wearing dress are often called `` sluts '' and mocked . 
  some of them are tired of this harassment and start wearing only pants and a veil to make it stop . 
  and then , through the years , more and more women have a veil , and the unveiled one are even more harassed . 
  should an egalitarian society accept something that advocate inequality ? 
  indeed . 
  should windmills be considerate as robots by the way ? 
  after all they stole thousand of jobs through centuries , crushing cereals more easily than humans ... 
  what 's the definition of a robot ? 
  tbh i think pro arguments are more efficient than just yelling `` facist ! '' . 
  would a le pen voter change his vote because of this picture ? 
  probably not . 
  would he change it if we explain that macron wants ( for example ) to secure his retirement fund ? 
  maybe ... at least he 'll have practical infos to think about . 
  i vote for everyone who 's ok to destroy montparnasse tower . 
  of course . 
  but it 's better than nothing . 
  there 's [ a link to a 9-pages pdf ] ( http://europeanmovement.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/europe-paragraphs-in-french-election-programmes.pdf ) at the end of this article , with much more details . 
  now that you mention it , is there any metal cover of it somewhere ? 
  french women seem kinda excited by macron ... is that what you mean with your demography thingy ? 
  this indicator is misleading imho . 
  if you 're single , owned a nice house and do n't have to work because some stockoptions get you 1100 $ / month , you are `` poor '' . 
  if you have 3 kids and have to pay 600 $ / month as rent , but your job is payed 1300 $ / month , you are `` not poor '' . 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  `` poors '' in the 50s were leaving in a hut and owned nothing more than their clothes . 
  `` poors '' now , at least in france , not only have free healthcare and about 500 $ / month ( rsa ) and often have a car , a cellphone etc. 
  indeed . 
  most used `` poverty indicator '' , at least here in france , defined poverty as having less than 60 % of medium income . 
  as french medium income is about 2000 $ / month , you can very well being payed 1000 $ , having your own house and an happy life ( without too much extra but still ok ) and being classified as `` poor '' . 
  maybe but instead of saying ( like macron ) `` eu is n't perfect , let 's improve it together '' , he 's saying `` if capitalist-germany does n't accept our blackmail , we fuckup the eu and start a new one '' . 
  i really hope not !, 
  the only candidates that do n't want a frexit are fillon and macron . 
  do n't forget about m\u00e9lenchpn , from the far-right . 
  kinda like le pen but instead of being xenophobic against migrants , it 's about germany . 
  one solution i like is when wealthy people are encouraged ( with tax deduction ) to invest in local economy . 
  indeed . 
  on the 11 candidates , only 3 wants to stay within the current eu : macron , fillon ( not a federalist but still want to build more/better eu ) and hamon ( though he 'd like to have more freedom with french debt ) . 
  all the others are for a kind of frexit ( m\u00e9lenchon , le pen , dupont-aignan ... ) or just total clowns ( cheminade , lassalle , poutou ... ), 
  yeah , [ his plan ] ( http://f-i.jlm2017.fr/synthese2 ) ( `` chapter 4 : leaving the european treaties '' ) is to negociate new treaties with the eu ( which include `` no more debt surveillance '' and `` the creation of a new currency '' , something nobody else will agree with ) and then to do a referendum . 
  if the referendum fails , they activate article 50 ( chapter 4-b of their official program ) . 
  well they helped in the way that * fighting against them * create modern europe . 
  newton , descartes , goeth , de vinci ... 
  they all had christian background of course , but their works grow way beyond that ( especially when it was about science or philosophy ) . 
  arts and calendar i give you that , but for the others ... * laws : how ? 
  `` thou shall not kill '' is n't really a very innovative or complex rule ... * economics : what ? 
  does christian values have any relation with capitalism ? 
  * politics : where ? 
  republic and democracy were already discussed in ancient greece . 
  and montesquieu , rousseau and others did more for our modern democracy than 2000 years of christianity . 
  * holidays : sorry but most of christian holidays were chosen specifically to replace already existing pagan holidays . 
  * moral : just no . 
  christianity ruled for almost 2000 years in europe and it did n't prevent slavery , sexism , racism or homophobia , quite the contrary [ in fact ] ( https://imagecdn1.luxnet.ua/tv24/resources/photos/news/620_dir/201506/583553_1275030.jpg?201506125119 ) . 
  it 's only since the last 2 centuries , thanks to the lumi\u00e8res , that we slowly build our modern moral . 
  christian values are a part of europe history , that 's a fact nobody can deny , but our modern europe , the beacon of democracy , human rights , scientific progress etc. 
  was built by men ( and women ) who , in the last 3-4 centuries through the enlightenment , * overcome * those values and replace them with better ones . 
  you mean the values who , for centuries , burnt women with read hair , threaten to torture galileo , censured voltaire and anyone with rational ideas ? 
  tbh i 'm hesitating . 
  even if fillon is guilty , it 's not some big things and in the end , only the program 's matter : macron is more pro-europe for sure , that 's a strong plus for me . 
  but his economic ideas are still very blurry . 
  fillon programs seems more efficient to improve the country finance . 
  if we have one of those two , i 'll be ok . as long as it 's not le pen or m\u00e9lenchon !, 
  * allied with the pcf . 
  * wants to leave the eu . 
  * wants to tax you at 100 % if you win more than 33k $ / month . 
  * wants to change france constitution . 
  do n't forget m\u00e9lenchon is allied with the pcf ( french communist party ) : http://www.mesopinions.com/public/img/petition/petition-img-25973-fr.jpeg, 
  well m\u00e9lenchon want to tax you at 100 % if you win more than 33000 $ / month ... 
  dupont-aignan has some very interesting ideas in his program but he sadly wants to leave eu . 
  also fillon has a real group with him , strong of decades of politics with thousand of mayers/deputies/senators . 
  dupont-aignan is kinda alone . 
  the problem is that , in france , `` liberal '' just mean `` evil '' for a lot of people . 
  * le pen : xenophobic , frexit and crazy economic program . 
  * m\u00e9lenchon : frexit and far-left program . 
  * macron : pro-eu , kinda liberal , but also very blurry . 
  got backup from the current socialist president . 
  * fillon : * may * have done some immoral things in the past ( but nothing big or even unusual . 
  remember that in france , 20 % of deputies hire their relatives ! ) . 
  got a conservative program focused on debt reduction . 
  he wants to improve the eu , not leaving it . 
  so yeah , you do n't have much choice : if you 're anti-eu , you 're going to vote le pen or m\u00e9lenchon , if you just want a `` normal '' president , you only have macron or fillon , depending if you 're more center/left-wing or right-wing . 
  to explain why they vote fillon , some people say : `` do you prefer to be operated by a good surgeon with a hidden bank account or by a honest but mediocre surgeon ?
