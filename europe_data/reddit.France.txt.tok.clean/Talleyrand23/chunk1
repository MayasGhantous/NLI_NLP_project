look at op comment history . 
  the facf is there there is a new cold war western propaganda will be harsh for the russians . 
  [ people can not make the difference ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com.au/cnn-aviation-expert-theory-on-mh370-2015-2 ) look what did happen to iran with western media . 
  russia is able to shield itself but his no more on the offensive side or countering american media since the end of the cold war since western dominate the narrative . 
  yes, 
   well yeah , if it was my country being carefully molested and raped by a superpower ; i would want any help i can get . 
  i ca n't say i blame him . 
  so you are willing to raise the numbers of death of your owm citizens to beween 1 millions and 2 millions . 
  because 3000 casualties orginally was not enough ? 
   sch\u00e4uble on the other hand ... 
  he will give you a loan, 
  and you are perfectly right this story was screaming propaganda . 
  the fact that i gave proof and that my comment is at the bottom show it . 
   i feel bad for answering a shill , but whatever . 
  from the same guardian article : please i could have stop right here   officials from the eu 's monitoring mission ( eumm ) say one new sign has been placed 300 metres south of a previous marker near the village of orchosani , while another has been moved 1km further south near tsitelubani . 
  ** but they could not say if russia and south ossetians went beyond their borders ** this is literally written nor do they are saying `` ok georgia is right '' ** they didnt **  i think the pipeline is being highlighted to attract more attention from the west ( of course oil is more important than anything else ) . 
  did you read again ** according to bp the owner of the pipeline nothing have been affect and its the same situation since 2008 **  the real issue here is the people who live there . 
  they will forbid locals to move across the new `` border '' and force them to take russian passports . 
  of course south ossetinans consider georgians as foreigners since 1989 dont expext free borders for long . 
   nothing changes ? 
  really ? 
  i 'll mark a territory inside your country , put my military yes and ** those are the words of the eu monitoring missions ** dont expext me to take `` your words '' instead of those of an international organization . 
  edit : ok ok ok ** now its 300m ** ** and no more ** 1,5km-2km as claimed by the georgians 2 days ago lol  https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d4t8m/creeping_occupation_russia_advances_2km_into?sort=hot now you see there is a reason why i trust the eu monitoring mission words and not that of a georgian . 
   ** they ( offcials from the eumm ) would not say whether this meant russia had seized territory beyond south ossetia 's disputed administrative boundary line ** . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/georgia-accuses-russia-of-violating-international-law-over-south-ossetia so why throwing a warning if even the monitoring mission is not backing georgia ? 
   however , georgia 's energy minister , kakha kaladze , and bp spokesperson tamila chantladze say bp has not had access to that section of pipeline since the 2008 war . 
  ms chantladze stressed that the pipeline was operating as normal . 
  so nothing change since 2008, 
  your point was perfectly valid , why the downvotes your point stand french media also reported nothing thanks for sharing !, 
   you can , but you get downvoted , because nobody likes a dumb spammer , and how he is a dumb spammer just a quick look at his comment history what i see is 5 links ( relate to russia ) in two weeks . 
   because look at longes 's posts . 
  he spams with every positive piece of news he can find , no matter how meaningless . 
  so what ? 
  people can not put positive news on russia . 
  its not like he use rt but a western source from a well known organization, 
   for once i feel that we can be useful . 
  usually france is n't heard on the european scene : our economical situation does not allow us to be on the same level as germany . 
  guess why ? ... 
   i guess we have a lot experience when it comes to negociating with the germans so greece can use that ... 
  lets not pretend shall we ? 
  wich experience `` negociating '' with the germans ? 
  since sarkozy it was always one side and it come straight from berlin . 
  until i see something i will stay skeptical . 
  look i will be brusque : i dont think italy will improve in the next 15 years you are 24 and you wont find a job with an ir degree inside italy or outside in other eu countries , time is ticking since you have an handicap what i advise you is to become at least a `` braille teacher '' or a special education need teacher . 
  they are seriously in need in pretty much every countries specially the one specialised with blind people . 
  and it doesnt take many years to study . 
  they are quite rare in emerging markets and are in need in western countries while usually they have a middle class salary or even upper class in some cases . 
  this is my two cents . 
  but the reality is simple you wont go nowhere with an ir degree specially not in today world . 
   the only thing that could crumble our government are explosives that is not what i saw two years ago italy if anything is a clone of southern europe . 
   he is saying this only since 4 years ago . 
  it is the true how long we should wait before your governement of mafiosi crumble ? 
  it happen with the `` russians '' also, 
  ** saudi arabia to invest up to $ 10 billion in russia ** * faced with sanctions from the west , russia is turning eastward for investment * * kirill dmitriev , chief executive of the russian direct investment fund , said saudi arabia has signed a commitment to invest up to $ 10 billion in russia . 
  * by andrey ostroukh moscow -- saudi arabia has signed a commitment to invest up to $ 10 billion in russia , the russian direct investment fund said monday . 
  russia 's latest pact with its closest oil-producing rival marks moscow 's efforts to replace western funding , which has been hit by sanctions , just a few days before a summit of five major emerging economies , known by the acronym of brics , to be held in russia 's town of ufa . 
  the majority of the $ 10 billion from saudi arabia 's sovereign-wealth fund , public investment fund , will be spent on russia 's agricultural projects , as well as on medicine , logistics , and the country 's retail and real estate sectors , rdif chief kirill dmitriev told the wall street journal . 
  yes i read it as we saw the allocations from the eu cohesion funds for the 2014-2020 period equal 2-3 percent of the countries gdp . 
   czech republic would get a boost of 0,3 % of gdp if we managed to absorb 90 % of available funds for 2014 . 
  but we absorb only 50 % do you have any sources ? 
  well if we are going to nitpick , i want the average for the entire period the last period 2007-2003 the average absortion was 83,28 % https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/eu-cohesion-funding/bar-chart-funds-absorption-rate-cohesion-policy-20/g67v-zjyr, 
  you wrote that they are under 2 % of the gdp wich is false ** allocation eu funds as percentage of gdp ** czech republic : 2,1 % slovakia : 2,8 % poland : 2,9 % hungary : 3,2 % https://www.erstegroup.com/en/press/press-releases/archive/2014/3/11/eu-cohesion-polica-2014-2020~research-zentral-osteuropa you put the ocde growth forecast ( that are always generous ) let see the world bank http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects/regional-outlooks/global-economic-prospects-june-2015-europe-and-central-asia-analysis#2 basically only poland is out of the equation . 
  we can also look see their real growth in 2014 since the fiscal year was over the eu contribution were still higher than the real growth they had in 2014 . http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg, 
   take your dirty money together with this colonial attitude and stfu . 
  yeah i wish that also , dumb politicians are still in power . 
   also , learn some english , half of your idiotic comment makes absolutelly no sense . 
  sorry , mobile i mean dude i just didnt have the chance to go to london and to work as a plumber that sure help you with your english , 
  moochers for life babe , 
  our gdp growth before accession was higher and it 's not going to change without few roads ** what a big load of crap and you believe it how nuts that must be i am an econ boy do you want to see how much gdp including cushion to protect against sanctions and no it was not only free roads  we did n't joined just for easy money and yes that was  if the price is to be abused as secondary class members , then there 's no point to continue membership . 
  what did you ever think you would be my equal ? 
  you seems to have forgot what the germans and the french use to put you inside the union . 
  nor did the excuses they use . 
  good thing you want to leave but we both know you are addict  what you and the other arrogants are talking about is not the `` union '' , it 's just your dictate . 
  migrant quotas is a retarded idea and not any solution , especially if these illegall migrants will get back to the richer countries where they can freely abuse social privillages . 
  bla bla bla that was one of the solution proposed , your explanation is not what your politicians use as excuses see for example this articles, 
   how arogant can be person and in same time how missinformed about many topics and having lack of history knowladge ... just stunning ... ... ... what a surprise calling me a layman when i have a background `` in economics '' plus ejaculating rethoric well this will be fun putting you down  please enlighten me wich topics and where i am wrong ? 
  i am waiting, 
   ** what recession ? 
  ** all countries in central eastern europe are predicted to grow their real gdp with over 3 % this year eu subsidies are under 2 % of their gdp . 
  so even if all funds are cut right now , most people wont even realize it here . 
  false please post some links you better have sources because i am finance guy i am waiting for them  sure i want to cut them , i was a harsh opponents of them . 
  ok fine lets cut the subsidies and enjoy your recession . 
   so , in another words the countries `` completly '' dependent on the eu structural funds needs to shut the f. . . up and obey the orders . 
  well yes/no considering you are the one receiving money did you know if all the subsidies stop . 
  poland will be in recession ? 
  this is an union we might as well use some political leverage . 
  rejecting migrant quota decide by the eu , than feel to leave and close the door . 
  my point is simple dont hope western nations to take all the burden and walk away by taking only the good things . 
   ** they * have * to do it on all 28 eu member states at once ** so you want to force russia , good luck with that feel free to brought it the world trade organisation ( wto ) and enjoy losing your case . 
  dont be surprise if a country put counter sanctions on you . 
  this is quite annoying with eastern europe hundred of billions spent on them ( that will keep going ) and they still have that mentality and not willing to share the burden while they are completely dependant . 
  the guy is bankruupt and broke give him some time, 
   this is probably less than 5 % of our gdp year to year . 
  are you saying that without 3,4 % gdp net year to year from the eu you would still able to grow ? 
  this is hilarious . 
  just this percentage allow you to overtake russia ( wich is around 400 of your ppp ) wich i was arguing with the guy and where i was right including the rusky . 
   also , over 30 % of those subsidies go back to `` old '' eu in general ( for example , germans get back  80 % of what they invest here through eu funds ) . 
  that doesnt change the fact that you are a black hole , still negative , not controbuting and that you will still have another 100 billions for the next years . 
  you are mooching and producing nothing of value there is is nothing wrong with it . 
   we do n't have oil and gas revenues that subsidize huge parts of our economy .
