i see ... that 's quite something ... 
  thanks for such a precise answer . 
  berdyanks ? 
  that 'd be quite a bold move, 
  wait , from the west ? 
  unless they have paratroopers , how could they achieve that without putin getting cought red-handed with his vacation-loving para-soldiers ? 
  patrolling eastern ukraine * someone , do a fallout new donbass overhaul . 
  this article failed to explain to me what exactly is going on here . 
  they are taxing tap water ? 
  water bottles ? 
  could someone help me understand this , please ? 
  i see ... 
  this is first time i heard about this `` event '' , i 'll look into it !, 
  i really wonder where this saying came from though ... 
  i think it 's because france did not provide full support to republican spain during the civil war in the 20 's , they only sent weapons . 
  also , the peninsular war of napoleon also helped to shape those feelings against france . 
  ps : spanish people/anyone-who-studied - the-subject-more-than-i-did , feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong , these are just my hypotheses . 
  fair point, 
  ~ ~ i think you mean bombs , i do n't believe that russians have planes with cruise missile capabilities . 
  that aside , current bombs are stable enough not to explode if they drop on the ground without the pilot 's `` approval '' . ~ ~ ** apparently they do . 
  ** chances are the consequences would be mostly polluted water but this is not really new , there are at least 8 nuclear submarines at the bottom of the oceans that sank after problems . 
  their nuclear reactors * are probably still radiating . 
  i do n't think russia really ordered the rebels to shoot down mh17 , i still believe it 's a massive fuck up done by the rebels with russian weapons . 
  '' * top police officers can now verbally approve strip searches and car searches , without a warrant . 
  protesters can be doused with coloured water that stains the skin for three days ; detained for 48-hours without any chance to contact loved ones ; and jailed for up to five years for full or partial covering of their face . 
  that 's right - demonstrators in turkey are legally barred from protecting their faces from tear gas , which authorities have used liberally since the gezi protests of june 2013 . 
  * * perhaps most troubling , police can now shoot individuals they believe are attempting to attack any building or vehicle , or places where people are believed to have combustibles or devices that cause injury . 
  it 's no longer far-fetched to envision a police officer in turkey shooting and killing a demonstrator brandishing a poster on a wooden stick and being fully within the law . 
  * '' holy shit ... 
  post in / r/wtf , everything that barely relates to europe should not be here, 
  apparently , driving through sarajevo during formal events tends to start wars, 
  the message is crappy at best , they are shooting themselves in the foot over and over again , however i admit that the way it 's presented is really impressive . 
  i think that france winning the world cup in 98 was pretty big , every football fan in the country could tell you everything they did during that day . 
  any french kid growing up in the 00 's heard at least once the `` et un , et deux , et trois - z\u00e9ro ! '', 
  ( and one , and two , and three to nill ! ), 
  at school during breaks , referring to the score of france vs brazil in the finals . 
  secretely build it in geneva , so that switzerland becomes unwittingly ** part ^ of ^ us **, 
  cassos describes it well . 
  ca n't say i ever heard about `` r\u00e9gis ' '' here though, 
  very true ... 
  i guess my french part took over for a second, 
  oh good , that 's like choosing between pest and cholera, 
  indeed , i have some doubts on op 's reasonning . 
  what are we talking about here ? 
  rugby would be my first guess ? 
  hey , we lost corsica on that one . 
  care to explain , italy ? 
  the title is not well worded . 
  the un didnt say that eu unity was at risk because of migrants . 
  they simply said that eu unity was at a risk , to which the journalist added the `` as '' proposition , to highlight the fact that these events are happening at the same time . 
  nope , popa exists . 
  source : my id card . 
  how so ? 
  the un has limited power when it comes to eu affairs, 
  perhaps it 's taboo ? 
  i do n't know, 
  and you end up with the french [ monarchy flag ] ( http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pavillon.png ) . 
  no monarchist myself , but it was a powerful state indeed . 
  thanks i guess  , 
  you wot m8, 
  source ? 
  i think you should also have been surprised by a tatar invasion of soviet poland in 1964, 
  well , israel has a united army . 
  we do n't , either all states are part of a strike force , or no one is . 
  this makes decisive action hard to accomplish . 
   jewstern part i laughed , not so much afterwards . 
  it 's mindboggling that so many of these terrorist attacks ( charlie hebdo , lee rigby , this one ) are perpetrated by people who were known and closely monitored by surveillance services . 
  and yet , these attacks still happen . 
  and then they want more power and erode our liberties ? 
  piss off . 
  for all you know , he might be in * your * basement . 
  now you know why many monarchists like the fn . 
  you 're joking but that 's what many potential members of the party think , they did n't want to be associated with him . 
  now that he 's gone , the fn 's popularity will probably increase as new people come in . 
  the migrant crisis is giving them plenty of material to work with . 
  the government also keeps fucking up everywhere . 
  their chances , sadly , are increasing very fast . 
  this summer 's been pretty rough too , at least where i live . 
  i 'm afraid that climate change will only make it worse . 
  my dad still jokes about it every now and then . 
  shouting `` i heard they got chicken at leonida 's '' , referencing the rationing of food . 
  `` hurr duur , they 're comin ' to take ` way our buuuulls '', 
  i 'm pretty sure that very few african countries offer flights to mexico , besides the maghreb region and south africa . 
  chances are the migrants lack any papers for identifying themselves . 
  also , you expect them to walk from mexico city to the border with the us ? it 's a very long trip , quite deadly even without the cartel war going on . 
  they 'd have no money , no knowledge of the local language . 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  you really think their boats would survive an atlantic crossing ? 
  you want perpetual war ? 
  `` we 're crashing this country ... *** with no survivors *** '', 
  commas are important . 
  because the kremlin thought of it as a show of force , to prove that russia can burn the food and still stay afloat . 
  it 's spite , really . 
  they thought it would unite the russians , but it backfired when they petitionned to save the food, 
  op , is that the map in the benaki museum in athens ? 
  i aw it before irl ... 
  sarkozy will soon begin his official presidential campaign , you can bet he will try to take votes from le pen , no matter what . 
  this means his campaign must be even more right-wing focused than previously . 
  either way , if we reach a le pen vs sarkozy , it 's like a victory for putin . 
  obviously , america is controlling these parties in order to attack russia 's influence ** / s **,
