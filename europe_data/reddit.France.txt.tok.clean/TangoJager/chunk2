  some people are just assholes are n't they ? 
  the smaller circles have no numbers , it would have been appreciated . 
  maybe it 's shock , they 're really trying to convince themselves that they shot another plane ( the `` sukhoi '' ) or maybe they are desperatly trying to create a cover story on the go . 
  they would most certainly reapply again right afterwards . 
  though it would take years for them to be accepted . 
  it was one of the arguments used against scotish independance too . 
  https://youtu.be/p-rfdmjsaw0?t=50s i found this video , without the music and a different angle . 
  ca n't help you on that , i was wondering the same thing . 
  probably a choice by the artistic group in charge of this year 's fireworks . 
  each year , france has a guest country for the 14th of july celebrations . 
  this year , it was mexico,

  on the contrary , people should see it to not forget that such a thing happened on european soil 20 years ago . 
  a nsfw tag is however indeed welcomed . 
  yeah , they are pretty much independant . 
  if i recall correctly , they 're based in finland , so out of reach of russian laws that could harm them . 
  he 's confirmed to be the reincarnation of xerxes then ? 
   ruined greece yep . 
  he was singlehandedly responsible for hiding the debt of the country in the 80 's , 90 's , 00 's . 
  i think it 's a clever choice . 
  no one wanted to deal with him , this allows ( i hope ) a renewal of negociations . 
  what ? 
  i like how the us is bigger than the american continent . 
  any other source ? 
  astronomynow.com doesnt sound like a good news source . 
  that microphone makes it look like she has a huge mole on her face . 
  i read somewhere that it 's not a sudden process . 
  they will gradually go bankrupt . 
  could be wrong, 
  welcome to finnish . 
  is this essentialy the first step to a grexit if the referendum gives a no to the bailout program ? 
  it 's true that this human shaped hat is strange . 
  but how do you know that this horse is french ? 
  edit : / s, 
  world war 2 \u00b2, 
  * it rolls , my chick *, 
  ... on met \u00e7a sur le coup de ~ ~ s reptiliens ? ~ ~ la fatigue ?

  literally the only comment is about a false flag . 
  this number is silly . 
  instability brought on by climate change for exemple will massively disrupt the african food supplies , rendering such a growth a very unlikely scenario . 
  not saying it 's impossible , but it will stabilize before that . 
  taxi drivers even assaulted an uber ** client ** in lyon a few days ago . 
  taxi driver is a dying job . 
  i do n't support today 's russia but they did not start ww2 . 
  it 's a stupid thing to say . 
  the winter war was a separate conflict . 
  the french government is leftist only by name . 
  sarkozy would have dreamed to do things hollande got away with because people seemed to spend more time discussing about `` is it really something a leftist would do ? '', 
  instead of protesting . 
  that middle star feels somewhat offcenter . 
  it 's uneasy to the eye . 
  would not die under it . 
  there 's wi-fi in novac now ? 
  got ta get those varla stones . 
  west-sempai ~ ~ ~, 
  as many here said , they will bring them later in a safer way , through programs like `` regroupement familial '' in france . 
  yep . 
  totally the same thing . 
  the culmination of technology, 
  it 's actually not the original song , the lyrics are about the school . 
  welp . 
  amazon it is , then . 
   i must admit that it bothers me that every single person in that video has better motor skills and rhythm than i have . 
  i think each kid got some weekly training or something , or so i heard . 
  so , do n't give up just yet . 
  they have their own militia , so why not vigilante groups ? 
  `` but what ` bout merica and ` obama !! 1 !! '', 
  what you said might be true , op 's comment still stands . 
  and honestly , i think the average american is currently having a higher standard of living than the average russian . 
  holy shit ... 
  how eu head of states react to a federal eu : `` muh sovereignty '' how eu head of states react to international `` trade '' treaties giving corporations the powers to dictate laws : `` sign that shit up ! '', 
  early results put hdp at 12 %, 
  one day , perhaps i 'll understand the russian logic . 
  perhaps . 
   `` we have seen the obvious electoral fraud , like at a polling station where a female official was told by a man standing next to her on how to fill out her ballot , '' she told the newspaper . 
  `` when we pointed that out we were thrown out . '', 
  i think you also forgot to read this part . 
  the thing here is that the akp is not believed to hold a majority in parliament . 
  that 's what the polls show , they 'll have to get a coalition . 
  now , if there 's fraud ... maybe a coalition wo n't `` be needed '' . 
  i know that he enacted some reforms a few years ago that basically saved the country 's economy . 
  it all went downhill from there . 
  i think you 're mixing up transylvania , in romania , and transnistria , on the eastern border of moldova . 
  thank you , i had never heard of it !, 
  genuine question : did something particular happened in 1980 regarding a world cup , or are you referencing the overall tensions between east and west in the 80 's ? 
  oh yes , very much so . 
  many of them , or at least the vocal ones , are pro-kremlin . 
  they have been involved in the ukrainian conflict , on the russian side . 
  `` gg no re '' - de gaulle, 
  it 's not an `` official '' bust , it 's been set up by a group of cossacks in st-petersburg . 
  as you can see , they 're real fans of putin ... 
  looks like someone needs a kiss, 
  what do you think about this system ? 
  as an outsider , i feel like this is great , but i could be wrong, 
  i believe it 's trying to communicate with us ... 
  russia just admited they are `` ex-soldiers '',
