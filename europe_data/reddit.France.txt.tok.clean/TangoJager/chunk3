  i 'm more inclined to think they 'll put much more migrants on their boats so that eu troops * wo n't * shoot . 
  i do n't think smugglers would want to lose both their ships and their future clients, 
  in order for a true union to be created , you need one identity . 
  people should start feeling more european , rather than french , spanish , british , italian , etc. 
  the only way i know to achieve that is an eu wide education reform , implementing things like `` european history '' but of course this would be met with a lot of nationalist backclash . 
  countries do n't want to lose sovereignty . 
  thanks , had never heard of this . 
  what happened in 2001 ? 
  really good point, 
  no , they 're like the gendarmes in france . 
  they are a branch of the army . 
  did n't know putin had links to minas morgul, 
  the french way . 
  nee - j - air . 
  j must be pronounced without the d sound , only the \u0416 sound . 
  greece gets constantinople back . 
  no polan ? 
  meanwhile france is happy with 0.3 %, 
  i do n't know what to say . 
  hello airstrip one . 
  it 's not a new symbol . 
  it 's the ribbon of st george . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ribbon_of_saint_george it 's been used several times before to celebrate victory day . 
  but it 's true that op 's gif might not be from this year . 
  they say that this country is 100m \u00b2 . 
  the m-95 degman croatian battle tank has a length of 10,1 and a width of 3,6 m. 
  that 's some ~ 36m \u00b2 of surface area this roughly means that you could theoretically occupy a third of the kingdom with a single tank . 
  yeah , and three flavours of them . 
  on one side you have the legitimists , they fight for the claim of [ louis alphonse de bourbon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_alphonse,_duke_of_anjou ) , descendant of louis xiv , the sun-king . 
  his kingname would be louis xx . 
  then , you have the orleanists , saying that [ henri d'orl\u00e9ans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_d%27orl%c3%a9ans,_count_of_paris ) is the rightful one . 
  he 's a descendant of louis-philippe ( ruled from 1830-1848 ) , the king during the restauration of the monarchy after the 1789 revolution . 
  he 'd be named henri vii if he somehow gained the throne . 
  finally , you have of course the house of bonaparte . 
  right now , the direct heir to napoleon i is [ jean-christophe bonaparte ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-christophe,_prince_napol%c3%a9on ), 
  that was very informative , thank you for your great comment !, 
  or [ this eerie picture ] ( http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/george-lincoln-rockwell-members-american-nazi-party-attend-nation-islam-summit-1962-hear-malcom-x-speak/ ) of george rockwell , head of the american nazi party during the ** 1960 's ** during a nation of islam summit . 
   from its inception the anp ( american nazi party ) had referred to african americans as `` niggers '' and had affirmed the premise that they were mentally inferior to whites , but rockwell became enchanted with the idea of a coalition ; nazis and black muslims could be allies , since they both sought the same goal -- separation of the races . 
  * sigh *, 
  well , [ these lovely guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_waffen_mountain_division_of_the_ss_handschar_%281st_croatian%29 ) were muslims . 
  everyone finds a way , i guess, 
  and they left ceau\u0219escu . 
  they could have taken him back too, 
  best of luck to you !, 
  i think limiting it to it 's role as a com tower is silly . 
  it was the most visited monument in the world as of 2012 , also has a restaurant . 
  when you think `` paris skyline '' , it 's hard not to picture the eiffel tower . 
  what would you define it as ? 
  i think you should rather post it on r/duolingo . 
  i 'm learning german too , it 's neat . 
  it 's actually the same size as the shard in london . 
  so i guess the author did n't count it as a skyscraper . 
  and [ pizza hut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgm14d1jhu ), 
  many right-wing conservative candidates it seems . 
  i know the country is a catholic stronghold , but were most candidates similar in the past ? 
  55 % is overwhelming ? 
  there 's still room for debate , the snp gaining almost every single scotish seat shows that too . 
  the brexit referendum is now assured . 
  i ca n't help but think the next few years are going to be `` interesting '' . 
  scotland will not like this . 
  today i learned the existence of the `` monster raving loony party '' . 
  3000 ~ voters . 
  [ nevers ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nevers ) is the capital of the ni\u00e8vre department , but there 's not a lot to say about it and the wiki page reflects that . 
  ( still unsure why they chose a picture ** from ** one of our few monuments , instead of a picture of it ) the city is rumoured to have been founded by julius caesar during his gaul conquests , starting out as a fort defending this part of the loire river . 
  a few centuries later , they started building a romanesque church , but they took so long that new styles appeared like the famous gothic style ( like notre dame of paris ) . 
  thus we have a cathedral with two naves ( one romanesque , one gothic ) and no fa\u00e7ade , you enter through a tiny door on the side . 
  most of the roof and windows were destroyed during ww2 by english bombers that tried to destroy the loire bridge and failed . 
  this might shock you , but they finished the job last month or so . 
  the tower is finally like it was decades ago to pursue the religious cultural stuff , nevers is also the resting place of bernadette soubirous . 
  a 19th century nun that claimed to have seen the virgin at lourdes , in southern france . 
  the body of bernadette is actually in a glass coffin , and her skin had been coated with wax right after her death at age 30 or something . 
  thus , she has not decomposed . 
  to change topic , if anyone is familiar with f1 racing , you might have heard of magny-cours , well it 's a neighbouring village . 
  and the famous racetrack is right next to it . 
  we also have a `` world famous university '' called isat , it 's for automobile engineers . 
  apparently every young indian student has heard of it . 
  what the hell , preachers ( whatever their religion might be ) encouraging people to disobay the law because they should follow the laws of whatever god they worship should be arrested and stripped of their right to preach . 
  this is nonsense . 
  edit : could someone explain to me the meaning of the texts behind the man at 15:30 ? 
  red text reads `` should we invade persia or rome or both '' i think . 
  this almost looks like a scene out of four lions !, 
  indeed , or at least those involved should be closely monitored . 
  i did upload the files to wikimedia , but what now ? 
  is there anything i should do ? 
  i 'm new to using this particular website . 
  eh , to be fair , it could describe someone that does not believe that the etna is awakened . 
  fixed indeed , thanks !, 
  they look brand new , where can i get my own tank for only 99.99 ? 
  `` please ignore what is happening on the mexican border '', 
  your link does not work sadly ... ^ the ^ government ^ got ^ them, 
  alright , i 'll try , good idea . 
  not really , it says `` ginta str\u0103in\u0103 '' , meaning `` foreign people/nation '' . 
  i 'm sure someone with more romanian experience could translate it better than i did , but i can assure you you that this article does not mention gypsies, 
  except for , you know , the monarchy part . 
  and he 's already out of the hospital . 
  i 'm pro-eu , however even though we have the parliament of strasbourg , this does not change the fact that i feel disconnected from the political process of the eu . 
  - it 's institutions are unclear ( the council of europe = / = european council = / = council of the european union ; for exemple . 
  three different entities with such similar names . 
  it 's a mess ) - european voters only vote for the european parliament , instead of having a say in who leads the eu . 
  i believe that this indirect democracy system can have some impact on voter turnout .
