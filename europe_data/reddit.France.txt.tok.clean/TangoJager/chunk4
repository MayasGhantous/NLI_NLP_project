  i find it amazing that 2014 was the first year when a televised debate was held for the european elections . 
  which is a good thing , i believe , but more can surely be done . 
  of course you can . 
  i 'm saying `` what '' towards your second paragraph . 
  fellatio machines in public places ? 
  that seems like a slippery slope fallacy to me . 
  what ? 
  apparently it 's a debate on maternity/paternity leave . 
  no idea why is the pump thingy relevant though, 
  modern day translations say napoleon , the first ones say caesar, 
  the first translations were that way . 
  now it says napoleon, 
  it 's forbidden to name a pig napoleon here . 
  thank you for the explanation, 
  i see . 
  does that mean we might see some territorial changes during his term ? 
  anyone from there could eli5 the political climate of the area ? 
  sell ... 
  the bikes ? 
  the bikers ? 
  poles and a biker gang of russian nationalists are not a good mix . 
  imagine the reaction of the russian press if one biker got attacked/killed by some lone polish nationalist . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  but , will it change much though ? 
  i thought the general election in the uk was first past the post style, 
  i heard that the scottish party seems to be doing alright , and is rumoured to be in the lead, 
  you would n't steal a statue of liberty , would you ? 
  serious question to macedonians here : what are the odds of seeing some kind of colour revolution if the government does not budge ? 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  not only ** this ** genocide , also the ones of the [ greeks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) and [ assyrians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide ) . 
  uh , til . 
  thanks, 
  that means the turks will soon take their revenge for their defeat during the siege of vienna in the 17th century , like that turkish official said !, 
  right ? 
  i 'd say that yes , sarkozy is likely to win as of right now . 
  everyone is joking about it in france . 
  rifts have appeared within the parti socialiste between `` real socialists '' and `` les socialistes de droite '' ( `` right wing socialists '' ) as they 're sometimes called . 
  hollande 's government has not really been described as leftwing , but more center-right . 
  meanwhile this helps the crap out of the front nationale/far right and their umps rhethoric one of their slogan is something the lines of `` down with the umps '' . 
  it 's a porte-manteau of the acronyms ump ( the main rightwing party ) and ps ( socialists , main leftwing party ), 
  france is listening . 
  also our prime minister is also listening since the surveillance law passed . 
  there 's a map somewhere showing the difference between military spending in europe between march 2014 and march 2015 , i think it 's either on r / mapporn or r/dataisbeautiful, 
  gr8 b8 m8 i r8 it 8/8, 
  did n't hollande say that he would soon publish docs about it ? 
  huh , intriguing to see that turkey is stil counted as a plausible member for integration , did n't erdogan say months ago that he did n't want to get into the eu anymore ? 
  sadly probable, 
  there must have been at least tens of thousands of deaths overall ... we do n't often hear of bodies ending up on european shores , anybody knows why ? 
  really ? 
  [ i doubt it ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_serbia ), 
   marriage means a relationship between man and women whenever you like it or not . 
  it 's the definition . 
  in poland . 
  5 % of our deputies went to vote !, 
  that 's how democracy works !, 
  thanks for nothing , * bande de connards * . 
  i still laugh thinking about that walkathon, 
  hey guys , another redditor over to / r/france found that about the website whois liberland.org domain name : liberland.org domain id : d173116816-lror creation date : 2014-06-26t22 :03:00 z updated date : 2014-08-26t03 :47:30 z registry expiry date : 2015-06-26t22 :03:00 z sponsoring registrar : tucows inc.

  i guess another angle would be appreciated https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8378/8381860858_f6456e5940.jpg it 's basically a big ass russian submarine . 
  good thing they called the country deutschland , and not a mix of literally every single micro state they had . 
  `` russia also denied the very existence of things such as * the usa * or * the united kingdom * , claiming that only the ussr existed during ww2 . '', 
  uh , til . 
  thanks !, 
  either it 's a reference to some obscure napoleonic wars-era trivia , or maybe to the uk-argentina relationships , if you stretch it a bit ? 
  i do n't know , what 's on your mind ? 
  ** edit ** : i was totally wrong, 
  and those reserves are ? 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_human_spaceflight_programme i saw many media outlets , as well as wikipedia , use it . 
  so i do n't know , it looks like i 'll have to ask my indian friend too, 
  well yeah , that 's usually how long they spend in the iss . 
  gaganaut is india also . 
  gaga means space or sky in hindi , iirc, 
  spationaut is ~ ~ european ~ ~ ** french ** . 
  astronaut is american . 
  cosmonaut is soviet/russian . 
  these guys are predicted to become the biggest party of the country , or at least second . 
  what the fuck ... 
  it 's been stopped by erdogan and the akp at least two years ago, 
  and you 're trolling right ? 
  grown = / = grown in a good way, 
  the numbers are from 2007, 
  most of us knew something was going on between putin and marine le penskaya , now we have some proofs . 
  i do n't expect this to change the minds of many pro fns . 
  most of them want someone to act on immigration , no matter what . 
  i do n't deny that . 
  however , he said that he wanted monetary incentives for * native europeans * , i do n't know what you call this but that 's a selection of the citizens . 
  that 's ... eugenistic . 
  also , an appeal to our ancestors on such a topic is pretty silly, 
  in developped countries , possible . 
  more traditional regions of the world , in africa and the middle east , will probably still have strong religious beliefs, 
  you do n't even need to use a phone . 
  simply have a working brain and a calendar, 
  positive discrimination is silly in my opinion , we should hire people based on skills and not because you have an ethnical quota to fill . 
  they held for a pretty long time . 
  i 'm okay with that, 
  maybe that 's what they wanted all along . 
  bad publicity is still publicity, 
  but ... jet fuel ca n't melt wood bows, 
  from what i gathered here , it 's harassment if you report what happened to the police, 
  unifying the farmers of europe was one of the goals of the early union , in the 50 's .
