  if you create a place where everyone has the same superior farming technology , where everyone has great yields , it reduces the chances of a conflict arising because of a lack of ressources , thus uniting the continent a bit more . 
  the wish of a vocal minority is n't always the wish of the majority of people though . 
  in france , the number of people that support the eu and dont want to leave is pretty big compared to eurosceptics, 
  the nederlands ? 
  i honestly do n't see what country you 're talking about . 
  not really , at least i do n't think so . 
  farmers are among those that do n't like the eu especially for the regulations it imposes on agriculture , and thus the fn is attractive to them . 
  the majority of the fn 's voters are interested by the party 's view on immigration , especially muslim immigration , but sadly most people do n't look any further than that and cast their ballots solely for that reason . 
  it 's saddening . 
  care to explain what happened ? 
  yeah no , what you just described is the [ polar opposite of a rhetorical question ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhetorical_question ) . 
  https://youtu.be/xslgdnbiuw8 in another universe , ulm is probably the dominant power, 
  the rise of the far right makes me shiver . 
  will it destroy schengen ? 
  the euro ? 
  ** when the first sentence of a post is written like this ** , you can bet that what 's following will be a conspiracy theory or some other idiotic rant . 
  holy crap . 
  are you really going to go on almost every post about russia and post this comment or a similar one ? 
  if he gets reelected in 2019 , up until 2024 i think . 
  i shiver to think about the state of turkey by then . 
  what 's the point of your comment besides instigating an argument ? 
  ^ this guy gets it, 
  huh . 
  i get the feeling this was made for the anniversary of the crimean annexation, 
  in school , geography and history class , all we talked about was that damn banana '' * from the south of london , to the north of milan * '' the only reason it was a banana is that paris was never counted for some reason, 
  very sad , this place looks amazing on the wiki . 
  it 's a world heritage site . 
  what the hell is going in moscow ? 
  nuclear weapons ? 
  for crimea ? 
  i think putin is trying to play it as the tough guy in this documentary, 
  yeah i know what tropico is . 
  i asked if it was tropico 1,2,3,4 , etc. 
  may i ask what tropico is it , and which mission ? 
  you have cought my attention, 
  and no one included the [ one where he f * cking looks like borat ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/stalin_in_exile_1915.jpg ) allow me to share this with you . 
  seems that the message worked . 
  in primary school we were also tought that he was not tall . 
  i speak french , romanian and spanish . 
  it 's surpringly easy for me to understand written esp\u00e9ranto , i ca n't understand it spoken though, 
  mercator * it 's extremely precise near the equator , but gets distorted to oblivion the further you go north or south . 
  i 'm not clicking that . 
  hooray for the news though, 
  nobody cares about it except the mayor and his team . 
  seriously . 
  we often joke about how the average person here has a three digit age . 
  erdogan consolidating his power , trying to bring back religion into the roots of the state . 
  stuff like that, 
  you still have romania ... 
  intriguing . 
  this already happened before ? 
  i mean , instances of `` canned footage '', 
  not a town/village , but i found it worth it . 
  it 's a summit in the alps . 
  it 's hard to translate but basically it 's `` wankspear '', 
  this might start a new inside joke, 
  in that case is it possible that we will see russia demoted to a secondary power falling in china 's sphere of influence ? 
  i see your point , however as you said these skeletons were over a thousand years old . 
  and we do n't have actual modern photographs of them for obvious reasons , only medieval drawings . 
  holocaust victims on the other hand , we got plenty of documents , pictures , humanizing them ... boggles my mind that some people are denying it . 
  the upsidedown nazi salute expression was used by a minister , dieudonn\u00e9 himself said that it was representing a `` quenelle '' ( a fish-based dish , do n't ask me why it 's so specific ) going up the butt of zionism . 
  yep , it 's that kind of crap . 
  people all over france love this guy , for some reason . 
  we are on strike again, 
  of course , i never said i would n't pay attention to them . 
  on the contrary , i 'll try to vote on both sundays, 
  touch\u00e9, 
  huh , that was very informative , thanks !, 
  i 'll res-tag you in my `` pretty cool historians '' group if you do n't mind, 
  ukranians , slovaks and ... vietnamese ? 
  well that godwin point was fast, 
  2017 will be a decisive year ... 
  right now , if they win , all they 'll be able to do is take care of ** middle ** schools , retirement homes , and some public buildings like public pools . 
  the d\u00e9partementales are probably the elections with the less impact , thus more than half of the population doesnt know what 's at stake . 
  usually only 40 % of people go to vote on these elections, 
  i think it 's trying to ... 
  communicate ? 
  oh , had n't thought of it as two words . 
  cheers . 
  what 's the italian word ? 
  i 'm so glad we got rid of that [ ugly flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalist_flag ), 
  please . 
  you seem troubled . 
  would you like us to discuss about your mother ? 
  just checked , yeah , she 's the editor in chief of russia today and rossiya segodnya , which is russian speaking rt. 
  what does the cyrillic part say ? 
  thanks , edited . 
  huh . 
  crap . 
  wrong . 
  the decisions made by this particular court are binding . 
  yes , because states that ratified the european convention of human rights have in theory agreed to respect the authority of the court . 
  ireland signed said treaty , and should apply its decisions . 
  it being based in france has no importance whatsoever in this case . 
  take all the credit at the national level , send all the blame on the eu . 
  holy shit , some people in this thread . 
  the court , which has nothing to do with the eu , simply stated that the deportation should be done after the procedure has been fully completed . 
  the council of europe ( to which belongs the human rights court ) and the european union are separate entities . 
  * third yurop so powerful we do n't even need second yurop *,
