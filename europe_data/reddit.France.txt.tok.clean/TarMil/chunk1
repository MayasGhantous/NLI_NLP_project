/ r/etymologymaps also :  pencil [ ... ] from latin peniculus ( `` brush '' ) is this related to what i think it is related ?

  them 's fighting words . 
  they added it afterwards though , it was n't in the original proposal . 
  you 're one of the very few french , non-norman people i 've ever seen listing camembert as one of their favorite cheeses . 
  what 's going on in normandy ? 
  i do n't think i 've heard of people killing each other there in the last 70 years . 
  we still would n't have had the northmost point though . 
  it was n't clear at all that you were comparing the spelling of `` goulash '' vs `` guly\u00e1s '' . 
  probably because `` bastardized '' is unnecessarily demeaning . 
  the full name of the soup is `` guly\u00e1sleves '' , ie . 
  `` cow herdsman 's soup '' . 
  yeah , no way i 'm moving there , the grass at the foreground looks radioactive . 
  til marine le pen is fat . 
  and til weight has bearing on political credibility . 
  i 'm not a supporter of le pen , but i 'm calling you out because this kind of name calling is the reason why they can adopt the victim stance that helps them get support . 
  it 's actually very common in france to have a ceremony at the church right after the town hall one . 
  and it 's not ultrareligious at all ; many people who are n't regular churchgoers do it , out of tradition . 
  is it the word `` marriage '' that you reject , or the fact that a religious ceremony has legal consequences ? 
  in the latter case , you 'd probably like french law where religious weddings have no legal status and only weddings at the town hall are recognized .

  i get this for both your links :  session invalid !,

  incenderry . 
  it 's just rounded up . 
   they literally do n't speak english in budapest . 
  bollocks . 
  i have lived in budapest for more than 3 years and barely speak hungarian . 
  i rarely have significant problems . 
  edit : it 's true that it 's harder to find non-dubbed movies than it should be though . 
  implicitly tagging all eurosceptics as far-right is a curious way to enjoy a debate . 
   that in paris we 're warm and welcoming . 
  i lol 'd . 
  austrians are so much into pastries , they do n't doubt , they dough-t . 
  actually in tfe it 's explicitly stated that it 's new york city . 
  but it 's so far into the future that it might as well be paris , rome or ulan-bator :p, 
  the fifth element . 
  yes , it 's a french movie , 
  of course they 're not the best , but that does n't mean they have to be terrible . 
  for example the biggest hungarian beer , dreher , is also far from the best but it 's still much better than kronenbourg . 
  you say that as if there was only one kind of french beer :p but it 's true that the most common ones are pretty terrible . 
  welcome to the newest members of our congregation , brother jakub , brother jakub and brother jakub . 
   i would n't consider a restaurant good if they did n't serve bread . 
  i think a more accurate way to say it is that there is no such thing as a restaurant that does n't serve bread in france & nbsp ; :p it 's pretty much considered part of the service , like tap water , salt and pepper . 
  congratulations , this is the first time i 've ever seen this joke being relevant , 
  as a budapester , i for one welcome our new serb . 
  overlords . 
  alsace and lorraine are both on the map , separately -- alsace is red and white , lorraine is yellow with a red stripe with white birds . 
  in france : * the one in the alps with a white cross on red background is [ savoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savoy ) . 
  it has a historically fairly strong identity and was among the last regions to become part of france , but nowadays there is no separatist movement . 
  * the one next to it with a white cross on red and black is the area where [ arpitan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arpitan ) is/was spoken ( the language is almost extinct ) . 
  being from there , i can tell you that the regional identity is no stronger than anywhere else in france . 
  i do n't even know where that flag comes from . 
  you are correct about the others . 
  om nom nom, 
  someone is indeed mad here . 
  no , but a * world * war begins when alliances spanning several regions of the world are involved . 
  germany invading czechoslovakia is a war , but not a world war . 
  it is indeed quite pointless , but i never understood why everyone interprets french people 's tendency to use their own language as arrogance . 
  most of the time ( not in this case though ) it 's under-education . 
  ah , yes , the famous bordeaux sour grapes . 
  very nice !, 
  i guess you could have `` volcanoes '' as the lower part of the big `` nothing '' . 
  ( also , `` rhum '' is `` rum '' in english ), 
  i 'll admit that at the time i was n't very interested in social , economic and political issues . 
  do n't forget condom . 
   i wonder if they 'll try to take the west coast with all those beaches . 
  they 've been trying for 700 years :p, 
  let 's add a couple explanations ( skipping the obvious ones such as `` germans '' and `` wet '' ) : * `` third world '' : used to be a thriving industrial region , but then the coal more or less ran out and france went nuclear ; nowadays the highest unemployment area . 
  * [ breton `` funny hats '' ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=costume%20traditionel%20breton&amp;tbs=imgo:1#q=costume+traditionnel+breton&amp;safe=off&amp;spell=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=imgo:1 ) * `` cunts '' : paris and west paris suburbs . 
  `` poor cunts '' : other paris suburbs . 
  * `` snail eaters '' : as much as snails are a global french stereotype , they 're actually a specialty from bourgogne . 
  * `` cheese '' : well there 's lots of it everywhere , but that region ( although a bit south of where the word `` cheese '' is , more like west of switzerland ) is where comt\u00e9 and other cheeses of the same type are made ( such as french emmental , which we grate and put on fucking everything ) * `` football '' : olympique lyonnais vs as saint-etienne is one of the biggest rivalries in french football , and they 're historically big teams ( asse is the only team to have won 10 national championships , mostly in the 70s , and ol completely dominated the ' 00s with 7 consecutive titles ) . 
  * `` nothing but goats '' : that 's a lie , there are sheep too in [ larzac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larzac ) , how else would they make roquefort ? 
  * `` french hats '' : b\u00e9rets come from there ( we actually call the most known type of b\u00e9ret `` b\u00e9ret basque '' , although there are other types such as `` b\u00e9ret landais '' which is much wider ) * `` cheap cigarettes '' : that 's for andorra . 
  * `` plus belle la vie '' : a tv show set in marseille . 
  * `` bombs '' : corsican independantists . 
  i probably would 've added another wet on normandy and a couple beaches on the mediterranean . 
  it was , back when we used coal from there . 
  apparently the [ opel astra ] ( http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/2014/08/05/hungary-july-2014-opel-astra-confirms-pole-position/ ) is currently on top , ahead of the skoda octavia , dacia duster , ford focus and suzuki sx4 s-cross . 
  a probable explanation for the difference from your perception is that car sales are different from cars in use -- richer families change their car more often , which skews the statistics in their favor . 
  ha , that one 's easy : estonia , latvia and lithuania are in alphabetical order from north to south . 
  141/141 , but i definitely would n't have had such a score before i moved to central europe . 
   free wales, 
  it 's a ~ , meaning it 's an estimate , their exact wealth is not known . 
   note that ice trains have two doors per car , opposed to the tgv 's just one . 
  yeah that 's an annoying part of the design of the tgv -- 87 seats per car ( for the 2nd class cars of the 2-level trains ) and only one door ... 
  thanks , i also misunderstood before reading your edit . 
  5 minutes per stop is quite optimistic . 
  in my experience high-speed trains generally stop a bit longer than that ( maybe not in smaller cities like le creusot on the paris-lyon line , but there are n't really such small stops in your design ) + you have to account for the braking and accelerating time ( which ca n't be compressed all that much for comfort reasons ) . 
  still , it would be a fantastic competitor to plane . 
   but i wondered it is so recognizable that maybe i put some lesser known place yet you chose mont saint-michel for france :p ( i 'm not blaming you , i just find it funny ), 
  it 's not a cake , cookie or pastry if it is n't sweet . 
  we have a pastry with a similar folding method as the icelandic one called `` bugne '' , and apparently variants of it exist [ all over europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angel_wings ) . 
  it 's 231m high , which is more than enough to be a skyscraper ( [ which is apparently nowadays considered to be 150 + ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skyscraper#definition ) ) . 
   if you can call that a skyscraper why would n't you ? 
  sure it 's ugly as hell , but that has nothing to do with matching the definition of a skyscraper . 
  yeah , `` galette '' has many meanings . 
  in my region ( around lyon ) if you say `` galette '' people think '' [ galette des rois ] ( http://www.usro-rollerskating.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/galette-des-rois-du-guide-de-pierrette.jpg ) '' . 
  if that 's the worst mistake you can think of , you 've never met anyone actually horrible at english .
