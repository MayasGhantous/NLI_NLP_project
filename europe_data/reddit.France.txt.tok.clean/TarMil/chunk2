  france just has too much regional variety for anything to be called `` national dish '' . 
  some people will tell you otherwise ; they 're just misguided pedants . 
  yeah ... 
  i may be scientific-minded , but that 's a conjecture i 'm ok with not testing . 
  yeah the real paris skyline is [ not particularly interesting . 
  priorities of eu include how the fuck are we gon na get gas though , it 's not like ukraine is of zero interest . 
  more precisely , the photo is taken from atop the arc de triomphe and the foreground is inside paris until the square in the foreground ( porte maillot ) . 
  right behind that square on a lower level is the boulevard p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique , the highway that circles paris and marks its limits .

  i actually do n't know corsican , but from google : b\u00e9ie micca sta acqua e vacca hanu fattu caca dentru ( do n't drink this water , the cows shat in it ), 
  and we have the same with a frenchman in corsica . 
  this sfw porn thing is getting more ridiculous by the day ... 
  have n't really followed -- has the uk 's response been in any way stronger ? 
  this sentence is like grrm throwing a challenge at himself . 
  your nickname has some kind of twisted relevance to the topic . 
   while on the picture it looks like it 's in the middle of nowhere , it 's not . 
  ah , yes , the famous giza effect . 
  if you exclude masts , the tallest structure in france is a [ bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viaduc_de_millau ) . 
  `` biffle '' in french , contraction of `` bite '' ( dick ) and `` gifle '' ( slap ) . 
  i 've seen it translated as cockslap or dickslap in english . 
  to be fair , it was the least funny joke i 've seen in a while . 
  cringe is the word that would be used for this in english indeed , but it has a broader meaning . 
  for example you can cringe thinking about a past shame of yours . 
  shlimazl -  poissard , backpfeifengesicht -  t\u00eate \u00e0 claques , friolero -  frileux , what else ? 
  yeah , the map only shows the administrative region pa\u00eds vasco , but separatists claim a larger territory . 
  that 's quite a fatalistic view . 
  my belief is more that if people gave a crap , then they would find an alternative . 
  and this is true about the world in general , although it 's particularly visible in hungarian politics . 
  that has its ups and downs . 
  the most obvious down being , orb\u00e1n is in power and people do n't give a crap . 
  europe vs latin america , then . 
  according to the totally not rigorous check i just did with google maps and a calculator , the center of the current eu is around 52.3 n 11.7 w , which is just north of magdeburg , eastern germany . 
  i do n't know , i think it would be nice for the capital of a  500m inhabitants entity to be reachable by more than two roads . 
  i ca n't tell about the resulting quality , but as far as being behind schedule and budget , i am absolutely not surprised . 
  i was n't sure , but when i googled , it looked like there were enough responses for it to be a thing , so i went with it . 
  for those playing 7 differences : kosovo was added ( with no data ) , armenia went from blue to red and slovenia from red to blue . 
  i do n't see any other difference . 
  the best kind of war . 
  always ready to discuss the topics that really matter . 
  are you not nimble enough to pull your underpants down through your zipper opening ? 
  is that how you guys pee in austria ? 
  i mean , the whole reason why pants have a zipper and a button above is so you can open just the zipper and not need to pull anything down . 
  original version , both subtitled and not . 
  but yeah in hungary ov without subtitles is extremely rare . 
  oh i know that cinema city at mom park and arena plaza * generally * have the stuff ; what i meant is , considering those are almost the only places showing ov and even there they have way more showings in hungarian than in english , this shows that hungarian audiences in general do n't expose themselves to a lot of english . 
  i live in budapest and whenever an english-language movie comes out that i want to see , i find that only a very small fraction of the showings are ov . 
  then again , being french , that 's business as usual , except here i do n't understand the dubbed version :p, 
  political party funding is a tricky business . 
  on one hand , if it comes from tax payers , then you end up giving money to people you fundamentally disagree with . 
  on the other hand , if it is private , then the result is rich people being overrepresented because parties defending poorer people just ca n't get the funding they need . 
  france has so many domestic supermarket chains ( carrefour , auchan , casino , leclerc , intermarch\u00e9 , u , monoprix ... ) that there are very few foreign ones . 
  as far as i can tell spar and tesco are the biggest convenience store and supermarket chains in hungary . 
  i bet you did n't giggle as hard as hollande though . 
  i could n't find anything on google . 
  source for it not being counted ? 
  i find that hard to believe . 
  nah , we also jokingly mock you guys , mostly about weather and food . 
  they 're not even french in the first place . 
  it 's cute really that you guys think we give a fuck about what you call them . 
  60 % of their voters , you mean , which corresponds to 17 % of total voters . 
   anyway , how about giving jews in hungary autonomy ? 
  how about germans ? 
  and roma as well ? 
  it 's only fair . 
  i do n't agree with 100courics , but to play devil 's advocate , none of these have a definite territory within hungary . 
  strasbourg is in france ... 
  fyi , `` sacrebleu '' is so old-fashioned i doubt anyone has actually said it seriously in several centuries ( not exaggerating , it 's literally medieval ) . 
   but since it falls in sunday this year , may 5 is also a day off to compensate . 
  they say the french do anything to get a day off , but in france if a holiday falls on a sunday , fat chance , you just lost a holiday this year . 
  it 's especially terrible because may 1st , may 8th ( wwii victory day ) , christmas and the next year 's jan 1st are on the same weekday , so every year we have a 2/7 probability of being thoroughly fucked . 
  it 's because `` eastern europe '' basically means `` ex-communist europe '' . 
  imagine if they called france `` ex-nazi occupied europe '' . 
  [ more precise figures ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5hiqxnt.png ) from the survey , for the lazy . 
  but the map translates other last names , so this one should be translated too if it does mean something . 
  that 's kind of the whole point of it though . 
  op 's budapest map even translate people 's last names when they have a literal etymology . 
  `` public level pay shit '', 
  i 'd do it for paris , but 300 stations ... 
  also `` cig\u00e1ny '' in hungarian , `` tzigane '' in french ( and occasionally in english , although `` gypsy '' is much more common ) . 
   internet video on demand in general is still kind of new anyway well , the legal ones are . 
   on netflix this excludes more than half the countries you listed :p, 
  apparently ( based on / u/lazyjaydee 's link ) the symbol is disputed , it seems that the flag was picked up by different people who gave it meaning for their own purposes . 
  fun fact : the french flag is actually the colors of paris surrounding the royal color ( white ) , symbolizing the people 's control over the king 's power ( which he completely lost a few years later , shortly before his head ) . 
  they can be cunts , but they wo n't be nostalgic cunts . 
  [ a similarly shaped ( though quite smaller ) fort in \u00cele d'aix , france . 
  ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_li%c3%a9dot ), 
  there was recently a mini-scandal in france about isp num\u00e9ricable with their ad campaign `` download as fast as ... '' , one of which was `` download as fast as your wife changes her mind '' . 
  when they were called out , they responded by adding `` download as fast as your husband forgets his promises '' . 
  yo momma is publicly traded . 
  yeah ... 
  i 'll just pretend they gave us our [ old flag back ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/drapeau_blanc_du_royaume_de_france ) . 
  til we 're absolutely average at something . 
  at least you 're not in tomato europe . 
   just fucking stop . 
  well , finally something we agree on . 
  it 's obviously pointless to argue about what you said or did n't say ; let 's leave it at that . 
  and you 'll note that i did n't say you said anything positive . 
  just that you downplayed what he did . 
  well that 'll teach me , next time i 'll screenshot these kinds of comments before their authors delete them . 
  you had at least twenty comments on this thread , i ca n't find a single one anymore .
