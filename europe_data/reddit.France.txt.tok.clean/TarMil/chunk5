  i submit to you . 
  i wimp out . 
  nah , touch\u00e9 is not very common but sacrebleu is totally nonexistent . 
  maybe because it depicts the lion 's mound , a monument that was built as a symbol of the allied victory ? 
  it 's not just about commemorating . 
  this is our currency too . 
  they 're effectively forcing us to accept as currency a coin that celebrates one of our biggest defeats . 
  wow indeed i did n't realize . 
  it 's not just a bit misleading , it 's plain wrong . 
  a pie chart where not everyone is represented does n't make any sense : o, 
  if we go by budget , the us accounts for half the * world 's * military . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures#/media/file:top_ten_military_expenditures_in_$_in_2013.jpg ), 
  it 's also called `` fromage de t\u00eate '' actually ( might be a regional thing ) . 
   in fact it ca n't according to the commonly accepted timelines for the spread of indo european languages date it back to at most about 10,000 years ago according to op 's map , those rivers were still joined 7000 years ago . 
  [ randall munroe agrees with you . 
  ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/53/ ), 
  i must have missed the part where he said he was one . 
  but is n't the stereotype about france that we are always complaining , what with strikes and everything ? 
   the big exception are the french . 
  you really think the french do n't practice french-bashing ? 
  hahahahahahahaha, 
  there is no copyright on the eiffel tower itself , only its night lighting . 
  you 're free to publish daytime pictures of it . 
  you guys realize that the european anthem is instrumental , right ? 
  well the building pictured here is [ tour first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tour_first ) in la d\u00e9fense ( business district just outside paris ) , but the eiffel tower is much higher . 
  i thought the [ esztergom basilica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esztergom_basilica ) was higher , but apparently only if you include the crypt . 
  probably still cheaper than in finland though . 
  you 'd think redditors of all people would understand that . 
  electrons are components of atoms , so they 're necessarily smaller . 
  they are much lighter than the other components , but not massless . 
  for `` combien coute un '' , i get wedding , swimming pool , divorce and website as completions .

  / r/lewronggeneration, 
  in france two people must be married to adopt a child together , but a single person can adopt a child too . 
  so what used to happen before gay marriage is that the child would be adopted by one of the two members of the couple , and the other one would be an outsider as far as the law was concerned : no legal parental authority , no inheritance , etc. 
  no , it 's very common for laws to pass with few mps present . 
  there have been cases where a law was rejected because half a dozen mps were basically playing hide-and-seek : they were present in the building but did n't show up in the assembly room during the debate , so that the other party would think they had enough people there to pass the law , and then they entered the assembly room just before the vote so that the other party would n't have time to call in enough of their own mps to outnumber them . 
  it 's a fucking kindergarten . 
  i can see when two neighboring shades are different , but i 'd be hard-pressed to match them with the key . 
   nobody thought that belgium would last 10 years . 
  many still do n't . 
  nah , that 's what everyone who did n't know about it sees , 
  if it makes you feel any better , in present-day france there 's a department called landes ( flatland ) and a region called centre . 
   it literally adds nothing to the experience of browsing reddit . 
  not true , especially not on / r/europe , it 's common for people to post something just saying `` we '' and assume that we know where they are from because of their flair . 
  celts are just in brittany , many other languages were spoken than breton . 
  until jules ferry 's laws on mandatory school in the 1880s , 80 % of the french population still did n't speak french but regional languages . 
  there 's also a road nicknamed [ `` napoleon road '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/route_napol%c3%a9on ) in france , it 's the road he took when coming back from elba . 
  fair enough . 
  but that 's not the idea that i ( and apparently most people ) got from your original message . 
  when kissing , you lean towards each other but otherwise keep some distance . 
  when hugging , your whole bodies are close to each other . 
  that is why it 's ridiculous to `` refuse to understand '' other cultures , and to tell them that they should act like you because their way is awkward . 
  greeting friends with hugs is one of the few things in the whole universe that i will never understand , and i refuse to understand . 
  nothing compares to the awkwardness of this unfortunate situation . 
  people , there 's a cheek kiss or handshake , use it . 
  those fucking anglo-saxons , always generalizing . 
  good attempt at a reductio ad absurdum , but my argument would only conclude that they 're of african descent . 
  which they are . 
  icelanders are of scandinavian descent , and descent is transitive . 
  are you implying there is something wrong about a system that favors thought-out comments over snarky one-liners ? 
  of course not . 
  the lesson to be learned is that even though you had something interesting to say , you ended up being ignored by everyone because of the way you went about it . 
  time to steal his armour . 
  same about foreigners in luxembourg . 
  hopefully they 'll learn their lesson and post their arguments directly next time instead of being pointlessly snarky . 
  france is a bit biased in this regard though , most cities did n't have trams post-war until the 2000s so we are not used to seeing old trams . 
  in central and eastern europe they are much more common . 
  that 's not a mountain , that 's just a big hill . 
  luckily moral people like you are here to balance it out by wishing death on her . 
  our closest equivalent to the onion ( although it has never been on print ) is [ le gorafi ] ( http://www.legorafi.fr/ ) . 
  they also have ( had ? ), 
  a short segment on tv in canal + 's le petit journal , the show that got attention some time ago for their segment mocking fox news 's paris no-go zones bs . 
  the name is an anagram of le figaro , the main french right-wing newspaper . 
  makes sense , i did n't see it because it was mangled by the encoding . 
  wait wtf why does the url say diszn\u00f3zs\u00edr but the search box says sert\u00e9szs\u00edr ? 
  i know they 're synonyms but why would google change the search text ? 
  when i saw the title i thought it was in / r/civpolitics . 
  almost every single line in the hungarian column yells `` written by an austrian during the empire '' . 
  i can see the logic if the place was partially subsidized by taxpayer money . 
  yeah , although i doubt they need it at full speed . 
   except that visa/mastercard , even when it works exactly as the german ec , is rarely accepted . 
  that must be quite inconvenient for tourists : /, 
  actually it 's lor\u00e0nt deutsch . 
  coincidentally , lor\u00e0nt is a hungarian name . 
  horv\u00e1th is pretty common in hungary too . 
  we 're not talking about freight though . 
  presumably because of that little event 15 years ago that did more victims that a train accident ever could . 
   10 villages around a radius of 50km yeah , more like hundreds . 
  hmm , when i was in vacation in the french basque country they called that a pastetx . 
  tfw i 'll never work on a project so ambitious that it has to consider road , rail , sea * and * air traffic . 
  yeah after a hundred times i fucking got it thanks . 
  all i 'm saying is that for some reason that guy insisted on replying `` bosnian '' when the correct answer was `` there is none '' and yet everyone keeps telling me that he had answered my question . 
  no he had n't , not until i insisted . 
   the man gave you a correct answer , so why the insult dude ? 
  `` bosnians '' is the general term . 
  but i was n't asking for the general term for all bosnians !, 
  i was asking for the term that designates people living in in republika srprska , and only them . 
  i do n't know , i thought the context made it obvious , bozata1 was asking to whom he should send his sympathies for having such a terrible president ... 
  wow , and here i was sorry for having been rude earlier .
