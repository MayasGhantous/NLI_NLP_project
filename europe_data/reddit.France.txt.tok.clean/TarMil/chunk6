  let 's not continue this pointless deaf men 's conversation any further , for both our sanities ' sake . 
  it really is funny how what we take for obvious depends on our culture , or origin , or other context . 
  to me it is a given that if an inhabited land has a name , regardless of its political status or lack thereof , then there is also a word to designate it 's inhabitants . 
  i can hardly think of a single place in france , small or large , where that is n't the case . 
  i do n't know the name for the inhabitants of north-rhine-westphalia , but i would have assumed there was one . 
  to you , it seems clear that people are much more adequately designated by their ethnicity . 
  and this seems to have caused both you to misunderstand my questions , and me to misunderstand your answers . 
   how do you call citizens of northwest terriotires in canada regardless of their ethnicity ? 
  canadians . 
  yes , and you also call them north americans , and humans , but that 's obviously not what we were asking . 
  we were asking if there is a word that designates them and only them . 
  i thought the question was pretty clear , but apparently not . 
   it is also not a historic or geographic region so it does n't have a regional designation . 
  okay , * now * i know that , thanks . 
  you have to admit that it 's not really an obvious concept , that someone would claim power over a group of people so loosely connected that there is n't even a word to designate them . 
  are you playing stupid or something ? 
  so again , what do you call inhabitants of republika srpska regardless of their ethnicity ? 
  one of the reasons was military , believe it or not . 
  in the 1870 war against prussia , half the soldiers on the battlefield could n't understand the orders , and that contributed to our defeat . 
  that was one of the reasons for the mandatory schooling laws passed in the 1880s , which were the main vector of the harmonization of the french language throughout the country . 
   can you use them with a regular b license in france like you can here ? 
  yes , you need either an a license ( motorbikes ) , a b license ( cars ) or a bsr ( mopeds , theoretical exam passed at school + practical exam passed at age 14 + ) . 
  [ could be * much * worse ] ( http://www.crapasaurus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/made-in-china-fail.jpg ), 
  i lived a few hundred meters from keleti at the time . 
  i could see that the station was crowded , and a few more people than usual walked around in surrounding areas ; occasionally someone would ask for directions to the train station for germany . 
  but that 's it . 
  [ p\u00e9tanque ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzhs5wigpwi ) is probably the most played one . 
  [ boule lyonnaise ] ( https://youtu.be/rlxjtb0f8fo?t=4m46s ) is the more sportive version from which p\u00e9tanque was derived . 
  would 've been an `` interesting '' situation if scotland had voted for independence just before this . 
  which is fine if the water tank is high enough that the pressure of the flush pushes everything down the pipe . 
  in my previous flat , half the time i had to use the brush to push my shit off the shelf . 
  it 's atrocious . 
  i think the point is that the guy justified wearing a colander on his head on his license picture by saying it 's required by his religion . 
  so they 're telling him that if he does n't wear it while driving , then it 's not actually required by his religion , and therefore his license picture is invalid . 
  [ dutch was the first one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=country+names&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all ) . 
  yeah , i have occasionally a little trouble with cashiers & such , but that 's it . 
  i 've been working in budapest for 4 years but i 've never been arsed to learn more than basics . 
  which is lazy as fuck , i know . 
  i should finally take some evening classes . 
  the objective/subjective verb thing is a pain , yes . 
  vowel harmonization can be a bit annoying ( should i use an a or an o with this particular case ? ), 
  but it 's not that bad . 
  huh ? 
  can you give examples of words with these 2 different `` e `` s , because that 's the first time i hear about it , and i 've been living in hungary for a while . 
  meh , the cases are just replacements for prepositions , it 's not as insane as it 's cracked up to be . 
  honestly i much prefer hungarian 's 44 letters that are pronounced consistently , to french or english 's mangled spelling . 
  the grammar is pretty weird though , that 's true . 
  yeah , but even if you pronounce then differently , it 's still the most similar pair of words on this map . 
  budapest has [ the largest synagogue in europe ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/doh%c3%a1ny_street_synagogue ) . 
  purchasing power parity i believe . 
   i do n't know how to edit posts probably because it 's not possible to edit link posts and titles :p, 
   i meant to reply to his first comment , sorry ok , i agree with you then , 
  no , xenophobia is hostility towards foreigners , regardless of physical features like skin color . 
  some people boycotted beijing 2008 because of the issues with tibet , though i do n't remember poles doing that remarkably more than others . 
  dude , if nuclear was counted , france would be above latvia . 
  giving money to religious organisations is passive secularism ? 
  depends on the level of confidence in the prediction , which is not necessarily the same for low-probability areas and high-probability areas . 
  i like to fuck with visiting friends and tell them , when going to the baths , to ask for `` egy gy\u00f3gyf\u00fcrd\u0151 jegyet '' , 
  [ tu da-da-da ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiimj9tuc8 ), 
  it 's actually not that hard , because the stress is always on the first syllable . 
  but then again , depending on your habits from your own language , it can be hard to distinguish between a long vowel and a stressed one . 
  tino rossi 's christmas songs have remained best sellers every year since 1946 . 
  [ petit papa no\u00ebl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2zmtmzn5ny ) , [ mon beau sapin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1wbu0xnmfu ) , [ il est n\u00e9 le divin enfant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nru-6zhu9h8 ) , [ vive le vent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffava3jaeti ) ... 
  some of these are originals , others are covers , like vive le vent which is a french version of jingle bells . 
  bane says it in the dark knight rises . 
  payday probably references that too . 
  those are things that are often advocated by the same people , but i fail to see why one of them would be a stepping stone to the others . 
  just look at france , same-sex marriage was passed as one of the first measures of hollande , and what we 've seen since then was one of the most right-wing styles of government ever enacted by a so-called left-wing government in france . 
  slippery slopes might not be inherently incorrect , but they 're not inherently correct either and therefore not a valid argument . 
   i 'm gladdened by the downvotes , by the way , because you 're telling me that if i 'm correct , it would be a bad thing . 
  no , we 're telling you that you 're incorrect , period . 
  holy slippery slope batman !, 
  i live in hungary where they love their fr\u00f6ccs ( spritzer ) so i 'm not quite traumatized :p but i do n't think i 've ever seen it with sweet soda . 
   wine is better if you add a bit of soda . 
  nah , this might have been credible coming from a beer country , but in my experience a spaniard knows better . 
   annoying the french does n't sound that hard . 
  how dare you say that ? 
  what i do n't understand is how there can be a split between rome and vatican ; since rome surrounds vatican , surely any place outside of rome should be closer to rome than to vatican . 
  i think you 're mixing up a lot of things . 
  first , i 'm not the guy who talked about racists in the first place , i came into the conversation in response to your remark about it . 
  second , who talked about trump ? 
  i am not saying that the word `` racist '' was the right one to use there . 
  all i 'm saying is that by focusing on this word , the actual point that guy was making is being conveniently avoided . 
  it 's a technicality because the use of the word `` racists '' is not the point of the message . 
   which is exactly why we should not tolerate ~ ~ racists ~ ~ ** people ** who want to throw out all muslims because of the behaviour of some of them . 
  there , can we have a discussion now ? 
   the islamists will push for small changes and the good peace loving complacent muslims wo n't see it as a big deal so they will allow it . 
  no less than good peace loving complacent non-muslims . 
  technicality . 
  the point remains . 
  [ it seems so . 
  ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/salle_du_congr%c3%a8s_%28versailles%29 ) it was also used when the president was elected by the parliament ( in the iiird and ivth republics , ie . 
  until 1958 ) . 
  the stained glass kinda makes it look like a religious building . 
  bonus france : [ congress hall in the palace of versailles ] ( http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/histoire/veme-republique/congres/salle-du-congres-de-versailles-lors-du-quarantieme-anniversaire-du-traite-de-l-elysee-le-22-janvier-2003/247123-1-fre-fr/salle-du-congres-de-versailles-lors-du-quarantieme-anniversaire-du-traite-de-l-elysee-le-22-janvier-2003.jpg ) where both chambers meet for constitutional changes ( happened 16 times since 1958 ) and presidential addresses ( created by sarkozy , happened twice , in 2009 and on nov 16 after the paris attacks ) . 
  arpitania independentists ? 
  yeah right . 
  the closest there is is some people trying to prevent the language from dying . 
  technically correct but not a very useful metric . 
  for example , london spreads far into relatively low-density areas , while as an extreme opposite , paris 's main business district is n't even inside the city limits .
