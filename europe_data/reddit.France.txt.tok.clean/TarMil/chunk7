  i do it because i 'm a butterfingers and i 'm afraid i 'm gon na drop something in there . 
  you need root permissions to wash your hands ? 
  no wonder so many people do n't bother . 
  i do n't . 
  do you know that the bataclan had already been one of the most famous concert venues in paris long before the attacks happened ? 
  it would honestly feel very weird to have it renamed . 
  pretty good translation , except `` pour l'honneur '' in this case means something like `` just for the glory of it '' , ie . 
  there were no stakes beyond the match itself ( because it was a friendly ) . 
  if that 's the case then it was way too subtle to be understood as such . 
  which is why your affirmation that `` it 's no longer the case in the streets of paris '' is a bit spurious . 
  it 's totally arbitrary to take 1 year as your range of study though . 
  it would be just as valid to limit the study to , say , 5 years , and then you 'd find that there were more car accident deaths than terrorist deaths in the last 5 years . 
  or you could limit the study to 4 days , in which case you 'd find that even heart disease causes fewer deaths than terrorism . 
  the revolution was in large part a paris-based movement , i do n't think anyone would argue otherwise . 
  i was taught that interpretation at school in the lyon area . 
  there is n't one official interpretation of the flag , actually . 
  for example there is an interpretation that states that the blue and red are the colors of paris , and white is the royal color , thus symbolizing the people supervising/surrounding ( there is a french word that means both ) the king . 
  that 's what was proposed and rejected by the iranians . 
  do you think the french were trying to force them to drink or something ? 
  where the hell do you get that from ? 
  but the comic pretty obviously implies there is something wrong with homosexuality itself , not just the lgbt movement . 
  my 5th grade ( ~ 12yo ) english teacher had literally the worst accent i 've ever heard from anyone , including my classmates . 
   because sponsorships for competitive gaming are soooo important of course they are . 
  for players to be as good as one can be , they need to be able to focus their life around it . 
  put in hours of training a day . 
  that means earning enough money from the game to not need a side job . 
   why are you so desperate for ` social acceptance ' ? 
  fuck public opinion , most of them are idiots . 
  social acceptance helps bring things like better sponsorships . 
   as for sc2 , they have a couple of guys , but nothing crazy . 
  lilbow had a cringeworthy performance couple of days ago . 
  apparently he had been training for the upcoming expansion , we 'll see if that pays out . 
  regardless , france does have one of the most lively scenes outside korea . 
  talking about flat land ... :p, 
  [ it is  ] ( http://media.paperblog.fr/i/579/5790275/signal-saint-andre-monts-lyonnais-l-6ns22q.jpeg ) ( i 'm from one of the hamlets in the background ), 
  definitions vary . 
  i come from a hamlet just above 500m , the overlooking area is above 700m , and we still consider that to be a hill . 
  yep . 
  starter , main dish , cheese , dessert , coffee , that 's the normal everyday french menu . 
   high hills #  highest point : 322m good one :d, 
  looking at what the left-wing french assembly has passed in recent years , i do n't think things would have been much better . 
  and football rules are pretty simple . 
   extra point play after a touchdown where you can kick the ball through the goalposts for one additional point or attempt to advance the ball into the opposing endzone again for two points . 
  fail to advance the ball into the opposing endzone and you can kick it through the goalposts for three points . 
  wait , that confused me at first ; those 2 sentences are separate , right ? 
  the 3 points thing is not after a touchdown ? 
  because if you can try to run for 2 points and if it fails you can kick for 3 , there is no reason to kick for 1 point in the first place :p, 
  what 's the story ? 
  well to be fair it 's a map of * stereotypes * , so it makes sense that some ignorance is present in there , 
   golden shield was that in order to blind the enemy ? 
  hungary did have stores open from 6am to midnight 7/7 ... until it was banned a few months ago , now it 's forced closing on sundays , and at 10pm the rest of the week . 
  it got quite annoying . 
  yeah it 's very common for bakeries to close on mondays instead of sundays .

  and kosovo is pristina . 
  not sure if that 's relevant to quotas . 
  plenty of trashy reality tv is made in france . 
  this one is a coincidence though , whereas the skyrim one was on purpose . 
  but he does n't come out of belgium , that 's my point . 
  as a frenchie , i love the merovingian from matrix but i do n't feel pride about him . 
  most people do n't have the reflex to check the scale . 
  hey , fo eu too !, 
  right above your head . 
  a man-made one is indeed still work in progress . 
  but are you saying that you do n't see the difference between a technology that is being worked on and random pseudo-scientific bunk ? 
  sure , if you leave aside the fact that nuclear fusion exists . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://xkcd.com/1138/ ), 
  two years ago ( last time i was in france for halloween ) kids were still trick-or-treating even in my home hamlet ( ~ 80 inhabitants ) . 
  dunno if they still do though , i can imagine people have probably become more paranoid since last year . 
  on second thought , let 's not go to lithuania . 
   splitting countries across different timezones did we look at the same link ? 
  lol it literally talks about champions and great teams , it only works as a sports anthem . 
  damn son , you really had an ax to grind . 
  queen of the andals and the first men . 
  similarly napoleon ( and later napoleon iii ) was emperor of the french . 
  in french they would define themselves as `` de culture musulmane '' , but not as `` musulman '' without qualification . 
  the `` as a mother '' argument is despicable when it is irrelevant . 
  here it is n't . 
  she was just explaining that vulnerable people ( such as pregnant women and their babies ) can not live healthily in such an environment , and she just used herself as an example . 
  yeah those are very common here in budapest , small apartments for single people in old buldings with the bed on a `` gal\u00e9ria '' .

  i like that the country with the rasta colors is * lit * though . 
  hungary is upside down too . 
  it 's inconsistent with the other translations , which are nouns . 
  it 's at 56 \u00b0 w , while manuae is at 154 \u00b0 w. 
  mainland americans have difficulties moving to mainland america ? 
  what ? 
  well there are many aspects and i do n't really know about most of them . 
  but for example i 'm pretty sure that the com ( communaut\u00e9s d'outre-mer / overseas communities ) citizens do n't have the kinds of difficulties to come live and work on the mainland that puerto ricans do . 
  the closest thing would be nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie i guess , whose inhabitants have a kind of dual citizenship french/neocaledonian ; but they are still french . 
  they are supposed to have a referendum on full independence in the coming years . 
  police is not military personnel , so yeah definitely . 
  actually they are part of france but not the european union . 
  out of the french overseas citizens , only those from the overseas regions ( guadeloupe , martinique , guyane , r\u00e9union and mayotte ) are also eu citizens . 
  [ see my reply here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51e83x/these_2_dots_are_where_the_islands_of_mar%c3%a9_and/d7bbj4s ), 
  bonaire , sint eustatius , and saba , yes . 
  france has something similar with martinique , guadeloupe , guyane , r\u00e9union and mayotte which are normal regions .
