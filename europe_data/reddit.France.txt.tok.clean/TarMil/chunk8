  but i was talking about aruba , cura\u00e7ao and sint maarten . 
  [ it 's a fucking nightmare . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesoy ), 
  they are part of the french republic , their inhabitants are french citizens and french law applies there . 
  they have more autonomy than the regions , but they are nonetheless part of france proper , unlike the uk or netherlands overseas territories . 
  i feel a bit bad that this is getting so many more upvotes than the original greek thread : /, 
  fun fact : despite being separated by belgium , france and the kingdom of the netherlands have a land border ... on saint-martin island in the caribbean . 
  yeah this was mostly a joke thread in response to the greek one :p, 
  i used the 180 \u00b0 meridian as the cutoff , but i guess both interpretations are valid . 
  if you want to use the international date line as the cutoff , then i believe the easternmost island is alofi ( wallis-et-futuna ) and the westernmost is manuae ( french polynesia ) . 
  yeah and those subsidies probably largely pay for themselves thanks to the tourism they enable . 
  [ sometimes it 's literally no one at all . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clipperton_island ), 
  either that or it comes from the ottoman occupation era . 
  how someone can believe any of the myths listed on the top graph is beyond me . 
  they 're so ridiculous even the onion would n't dare publish them . 
  ( just a side-note , `` hebdo '' just means `` weekly '' , if you want to shorten their name you can say `` charlie '' ), 
  i was talking in general though , not just football fans ( in reply to catopleba1992 's `` other than in football '' ) . 
  it 's the same with the english , they hate us much more than us them . 
  i think it 's in part due to the fact that france has a lot of neighbors , and thus hate is a lot more spread out . 
  baguette is not the only french bread !, 
  you can perfectly well make zs\u00edros keny\u00e9r with a good [ miche ] ( http://fr.aupaindore.com/media/22804/miche%20levain_cropweb.jpg ) . 
  not quite yet , i still ca n't accept the dry yet soft-crusted shite you dare call bread , 
  [ guly\u00e1sleves ] ( http://mjksz.hu/sites/default/files/juhaszosgulyasleves.jpg ) ( literally `` herdsman 's soup '' , pronounced `` gooyash-levesh '' ) is a spicy soup with beef , carrots and potatoes . 
  [ p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ehvjkxlshva/vv8pjbdrhii/aaaaaaaagpi/feigjxittwq/s1600/marhaporkolt.jpg ) is a meat stew , `` marha '' just means beef . 
  outside hungary , p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt is generally known as `` goulash '' , a word derived from `` guly\u00e1s '' , hence the possible confusion i was referring to . 
  if you see `` goulash '' on a menu outside hungary it will be p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt , yes . 
  but since the word comes from guly\u00e1s , sometimes people say `` goulash '' to talk about guly\u00e1sleves in english . 
  do you mean a guly\u00e1sleves , or a marhap\u00f6rk\u00f6lt which philistines have come to call goulash ? 
  a what ? 
  was totally bizarre to me when i was a kid too . 
  ketchup is for fries and hamburgers . 
  period . 
  together with balkany . 
  then i 'm taking the first flight back to france :p, 
   they can wear that clothing on the sidewalk 5m away but they ca n't once they hit the gravely beach ? 
  actually it is illegal in france to swim with the same clothes you wear in the streets , for hygiene reasons . 
  no , it just means that she is in power . 
  i think the words you are looking for are `` reigning king/queen '' vs `` king/queen consort '' . 
  the esztergom one is the bridge that crosses the danube to slovakia . 
  sounds a bit like handball in france . 
  thanks , makes sense . 
  not quite sure why it 's on august 20 though . 
  st stephen 's crowning as king of hungary is the easiest historical date to remember : christmas 1000 . 
  does n't `` yugoslav '' mean something like `` all the slavs '' though ? 
  maybe we were taught bullshit , but i 've always heard that the goal of yugoslavia was to unite ethnically related people . 
  not necessarily meaning that that 's how it was perceived by the people , but at least how it was intended by the ones in power . 
  we 're an indecisive lot , that 's for sure . 
  a couple months ago hungary would 've been red , there was a whole kerfuffle about the law that forbid opening stores on sundays . 
  kosovo now has the highest gold medal ratio of any participant , with 100 % . 
  too many small states , we already have trouble remembering what 's in the balkans near us . 
  the vast majority of recent terrorist attacks were done by european citizens or long-time immigrants though , so even then we 'd be far from solving the problem . 
  god dammit swiping keyboard . 
  of all the things to get your pantries in a bunch about ... 
  * sees flair * an independent catalunya would probably have its own team though right ? 
  i 'm guessing those who downvote you do n't see the relevance with the parent post , here 's a rough translation for them : on the fourteenth of july i stay in my comfy bed music in marching step does not concern me i do n't do any harm to anyone by not listening to the bugle playing, 
  edit : sorry for non-french speakers , i saw the title in french and did n't even realize this was / r/europe : / just said that it 's somewhat ironic to celebrate bastille day in versailles , considering that versailles was a symbol of the absolute monarchy . 
  in fact , during the revolution , louis xvi was forced to move from versailles to the tuileries palace in the center of paris to be closer to the people . 
  what they meant by conception is that monarchy did n't disappear on that day , not was the republic created on that day , but it was the beginning of the process . 
  loled at ukrainian bricklayers - in france it 's the portuguese who are stereotyped as bricklayers ( we do have a pretty big number of them , alongside turkish ones ) . 
  what 's your argument for removing part of the body _ not _ being mutilation ? 
   i 'm pretty pissed when the winning team stalls in the end of the game . 
  you must always be pissed then . 
  well of course a greek would think this was great play :p, 
  not quite actually , the eiffel tower is an exponential curve while the nuclear cooling towers are hyperboloids . 
   let 's not start throwing the cheese at me why would we reward you for saying that ? 
  the shape is inspired by the eiffel tower , but i would n't call it a replica . 
  it just means that it 's been used in a perfect context , not that it should n't be used anymore , 
  ah , that famous horror in p\u00e9cs . 
  are they any closer to finally destroying it ? 
  i think that 's related to the fact that the american military use metric a lot more than civilians because they interact a lot more with non-americans . 
  depends on the place . 
  in france both exist . 
  in hungary i only ever see boxes of 10 . 
  tallest structure in france , discounting transmitters : [ viaduc de millau , 343m ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/7/76/viaduc_de_millau_2.jpg ) . 
  yup , higher than the eiffel tower . 
  so they _ can _ actually win a match within 90 minutes !, 
  no it 's not , it 's made of black volcanic stone . 
  yeah i was expecting a bigger number , especially with orban 's push to give the nationality to people of hungarian descent . 
  first time i see georgia in but not the other caucasians though . 
  the baltic sea looks like an angel . 
   killkenny you bastards !, 
  the fort that was razed more than 2 centuries ago ? 
  unless you 're proposing to stand them on bastille square to be run over by cars . 
  ... you guys ca n't have treason unless it pertains to the royal family ? 
   uses political view as an insult ok mate, 
  he looks a bit like the tf2 medic . 
  `` anyvay ... zat 's how i lost my medical license . '', 
  yeah there 's visibly a lot of architectural thought put into it . 
  still not a fan of naked concrete though . 
  the scout ? 
  oh i know there 's a lot of corruption in the system , i 'm just saying that the very existence of advisors is not the problem . 
  they all have advisors because it 's literally impossible for an individual to be competent in domains as varied as they need to be . 
  note that it says `` en 1914 '' . 
  they were members of the triple alliance at the outbreak , although they did n't declare war . 
  they joined the entente in 1915 . 
  what did bioware do ? 
  what about it ? 
  funny to see hungary scoring so high yet electing orb\u00e1n who takes every jab at the eu he can . 
  i do n't think they do , and i ca n't find such an oath by googling around ( `` serment d\u00e9put\u00e9 '' returns stuff about quebec and haiti ) .
