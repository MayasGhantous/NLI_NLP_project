  considering how our republic came to be , if they did have an oath you can be absolutely certain there would be no religious mention in it . 
  wait , so it 's a mix of elvish and coptic ? 
  strange to see micro-states like andorra , liechtenstein , san marino , but no mention of monaco 's 2004 second place . 
  edit : ah , that 's because they are not members of uefa . 
  nevermind then . 
  yeah in french `` velux '' is basically a genericized trademark , we use the word for any roof windows . 
  indeed , recently when deciding what name should be given to the unified northern region , some proposals included `` flandres '' in the name . 
  [ that 's consistent with the 300 000 figure . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communes_in_france_with_over_20,000_inhabitants ), 
  good thing nobody ever claimed immigration would solve it then . 
  davy mcattenboroughface . 
  yes , that 's indicated on the map ( asterisk ) . 
  i think that was just an illustration of his no-fucks-given approach . 
  not quite three consecutive , there was someone else in-between the first and second , but yeah . 
  / r/sansdecpoirot exists ( even though it 's not very active ), 
  i really felt old when i realized that there are kids in high school who view 9/11 the way i viewed the fall of the berlin wall . 
  tyl how it feels to become old , 
  also children are more sensitive to bitterness than adults , which makes stories like / u/guildensterncrantz relatively common ; i 'm pretty much the same . 
  there are a lot of programmers on reddit in general , i think there are n't many subs where this joke would be lost . 
  or [ putain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gseadq6sps0 ) . 
  as someone who does n't have [ \u028b ] in my native language , this sounds much closer to a [ v ] than to a [ w ] . 
  when the fuck did it start to matter what anyone * believes * someone would say , as opposed to what they * actually * say ? 
  there was one in saint-etienne too , which was [ destroyed in 2000 .

  1km is not much and france is a big country . 
   the majority it is though , the majority of the map is white , 31.7 % is uninhabited . 
  rise of the planet of the donalds, 
  they do in coke en stock ( red sea sharks in english ) . 
  dr m\u00fcller , one of tintin 's sworn enemies ? 
  i 'd stay away from any business of his . 
  some would also go for trotskists poutou or arthaud , but not that many . 
  `` several '' is nothing  in france the median population is 380 . 
  as someone from europe , no we do n't all love this stuff . 
  we actually recently dropped below the 36000 figure due to some rural municipality mergers . 
  it 's still vastly more fragmented than any country i know of though . 
  but that 's neither city nor town , so it 's irrelevant . 
   you are thinking of fortresses . 
  no , [ castles are , by definition , fortified . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castle ) `` castle '' does not correspond exactly to `` kast\u00e9ly '' in hungarian , in case that 's where your confusion comes from . 
  it even happens between accents in the same language ; `` in '' vs `` un '' in french for example . 
  some people make the difference , others do n't . 
  french has that too : `` they were playing '' = `` ils jouaient '' . 
  of course , since it 's french , this 8-letter word is just 3 sounds . 
  i know what thread i 'm in  also i 've lived in budapest for years so i know all about trianon . 
  what the hell is a french dressing ? 
  also `` baguette '' basically means stick . 
  the bread is called that because of its shape , but so are drumsticks and wands . 
  that always makes english speakers laugh when they read harry potter in french ( which is fairly common because the french translation is actually really good and often advised to learn the language ) . 
   but you do n't have fangs . 
  i do n't understand this joke , transylvania is in hungary ... 
  plus it 's slightly curved , so from one end you do n't see the other , even from afar . 
  believe it or not we 've seen italians throw a fit on r/france when they found out about it . 
  from sexy to hilarious when the camera switches to the guys staring . 
  it has occasionally served as one . 
  remember : when a bitch whines , never cave in . 
  plus sandi was already a regular on the show so the change is n't as jarring . 
  not to be confused : wine from bitche vs whine from a bitch . 
  [ i looked up some numbers ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/irl/ ) and i 'll admit that i thought ireland was more reliant on trade with the uk than it actually is . 
  at least in terms of exports ( 14 % ) ; 33 % of imports is still pretty high though and much higher than from any other country . 
  the more diversify your relationships , the less you depend on any single one of them . 
  [ wales still does .

   they are light . 
  great , now i 'm imagining laser batman yelling `` i am the light '' . 
  same argument though . 
  out of all the procedures they could cover entirely ... 
  for the jews and muslims , it is . 
  for the christian americans though , it 's what mikatom said . 
  actually it was only plain white during the restoration . 
  for most of its duration the kingdom of france had fleurs-de-lis in various arrangements on its flag . 
  i too missed my predecessor 's joke , but at least i did n't call them thick in the process , 
  it 's 117 ad , not bc , so 1327 is only 1210 years later  in 117 bc rome was n't even an empire yet . 
  and wikipedia says moscow was first mentioned in text in 1147 . 
  these two things together made me miss your joke . 
  not an expert , but this might be related to the fact that moscow was n't founded for another millennium . 
   we r taking over . 
  ftfy, 
  wtf your link about the submarines redirects to [ this ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/technology/microsoft-google-was-wakeup-call-20070301-u ) : o, 
  do you refer to people of unknown gender as `` it '' ? 
  nah , as long as they did n't name it they 're all right . 
  uh no , it 's the provence-alpes-c\u00f4te-d'azur region . 
  postcode divisions are departments . 
  i have n't been there but i doubt it 's less urban than limousin or auvergne . 
  calais is further north . 
   more importantly how will it effect the concentration of guns between violent criminals and peaceful citizens ? 
  it 's true that gun control does n't affect criminals much . 
  but the question is : how often does it happen that a peaceful citizen successfully protects themselves from violent criminals thanks to their easily acquired firearm , and how does that compare with how often otherwise peaceful citizens cause deaths due to either accidents or altered state of mind ( anger and revenge , etc ) with a firearm they would n't have with stricter control ? 
  then again they did n't say it 's * purely * a gun control issue , only that it 's a factor . 
  yeah , not sure what 's up in normandy though . 
  i hope they used a counterweight . 
  -- / r/europe, 
   when politicians have the fear of the electoral pressure , they act diligently and they behave . 
  i 'm having trouble believing we live on the same planet . 
  well what 's the point of correcting `` overseas '' into `` colony '' if it 's a synonym to you then ? 
  colony means it has a subordinate status to the mainland . 
  french guyana does not , it has equal status to mainland regions . 
  there _ are _ some territories that can be considered french colonies , [ namely french polynesia ( incl . 
  tahiti ) and new caledonia ( which will have a referendum on independence in 2018 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories ) , but guyana is not one of them . 
  men have found exotic women sexy for absolutely ever mate . 
  the contestants are elected by local people , real people who found them attractive , not some grand conspiracy aimed at making us like other people for whatever reason .
