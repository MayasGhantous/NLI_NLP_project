100 % of myself want a referendum on ttip, 
  what is ea-19 ? 
  well it would be great but i do n't know how to code in python , i code only in c++, 
  thanks, 
  actully in france it 's anyone but fillon and lepen , so they choose macron as they belive he can qualify for 2nd round . 
  coming from manuel valls , it 's seen as an obvious move . 
  in 2014 , hamon and montebourg had a deal to push him and make him a prime minister . 
  couple months after , he `` fired '' them . 
  plus the socialist party is diying : every day we have socialist that say they are backing macron while staying in the party . 
  my bet : candidate | 1st round | 2nd round | 2012 results * ( or same party ) * - | - | - | - emmanuel macron | ** 25 % ** | ** 55 % ** | - marine le pen | ** 25 % ** | 45 % | 17.90 % fran\u00e7ois fillon | 20 % | - | * 27.18 % * -  * 48.36 % * jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon | 13 % | - | 11.10 % beno\u00eet hamon | 13 % | - | * 28.00 % * -  * 51.64 % * nicolas dupont aignan | 2 % | - | 1.79 % nathalie arthaud | 2 % | - | 0.56 % it could have other candidates , but they need to get 500 * * signatures * from office holders by march 18 ( * coming from at least 30 % of the * departements * ) . 
  all candidates need to confirm they are running in order to do so . 
  as today , the list of the signatures : http://i.imgur.com/6o7bz3f.png, 
  ok thanks i will use edge for this now, 
  there also a long flight between papeete ( french polynesia ) to noum\u00e9a ( new caledonia ) is pretty long with 4620km and it 's a domestic flight of france in oceania .

  [ see the wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cour_de_justice_de_la_r%c3%a9publique ) . 
  in france , we also call it class justice, 
  france only fully decremenalized homosexuality and gave pardon to homosexuality related crimes [ in 1981 ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=jorftext000000517004 ), 
  she was elected because of her family and her name . 
  they also elect deputies to the european parliment, 
  both are unpopular . 
  even far left candidat [ m\u00e9lenchon ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96742/jean-luc_melenchon_home.html ) was predicted to do better than the socialist . 
  like going transit in an airport and saying that i visited the country,

  it depends on cities , but in big cities , all votes are counted by midnight, 
  polls close at 19 except in big cities where they closed at 20, 
  she wants to do a referendum for the frexit, 
  melenchon does n't want the end of the eu , he just want the end of this liberal eu, 
  no but they will update at 8pm because they are prohibited by the law to give results before this time, 
  the law prohibits media from divulging results or exit polls before all polling stations are closed at 20, 
  yes, 
  20h in france , but belgium and swiss media can '' `` leak '' '' results before . 
  yes , it started in saint pierre et miquelon, 
  polls close at 20:00 in big cities or at 19:00 for other polling stations . 
  for the results , i will update the post with links . 
  thanks , 
  hamon is the official candidate of the socialist party , but he criticize the current government which a socialist government . 
  there is also macron who have a lot of support coming from socialist deput\u00e9s and even ministers . 
  low turn out will benefit to lepen . 
  high to m\u00e9lenchon, 
  it 's just respect for police and for the candidate, 
  i took the informations from wikipedia . 
  i do n't know ... 
  in [ 2002 , we had a terrorist attack ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuerie_de_nanterre ) two days before the vote and it may have helped jean marie le pen qualified to the second round . 
  honestly , i think nobody can tell if it will help le pen . 
  i will do a reddit live but i do n't know about tv . 
  maybye the bbc ? 
  i saw the [ megathread about the dutch general ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zdblx/dutch_general_election_2017_megathread/ ) elections which had a very informative summary , so i decided to do the same for the french elections in 2017 so people could know who are the candidates and the parties .

  * -- #french presidential election ### * pr\u00e9sident de la r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise * ## sunday april , 23rd 2017 and sunday may , 7th 2017 -- #election system ** cycle : ** every 5 years , unless the president resign , die or is impeached . 
  happen twice in 1969 ( resigned ) and 1974 ( died ) . 
  ** voting system ** : [ two-round system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two-round_system ) ** apportionment method ** : 50 % of votes . 
  if no candidates received 50 % , a second run is appointed with the 2 candidates who received the most votes . 
  ** requirements to run ** : in order to be admitted as an official candidate , potential candidates must receive signed nominations ( informally known as * parrainages * , for * sponsors * ) from more than 500 elected officials , mostly mayors . 
  these officials must be from at least 30 territorial [ collectivities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/administrative_divisions_of_france ) ( * departement * or overseas territories ) , and no more than 10 % of them should be from the same collectivity . 
  furthermore , each official may nominate only one candidate . 
  there are exactly 45 543 elected officials , including 33 872 mayors . 
  ** short summary ** : the french political system has in its center the french president . 
  unless other european country such as germany , italy , greece or portugal , the president has a lot of power . 
  he has the power to choose the prime minister , however the * assembl\u00e9e nationale * ( lower house of the parliament ) has the sole power to dismiss the prime minister and his gouvernement . 
  so the president must choose a pm who have a majority in the lower house and there is two case : * the lower house is in the same side of the president , so the president have a more active role than the pm in the governing of france . 
  * the lower house is the opposition of the president and it 's called the * cohabitation * . 
  the president 's power is diminished and the prime minister is de facto the * chief * . 
  happend 3 time : 1986 and 1993 with a left wing president and a right wing parliament . 
  in 1997 with the opposite . 
  also , the president commands the army , can use the nuclear weapons , names a lot of official ( including * [ prefets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prefect_\\ ( france \\ ) ) * , who represents the state and the administration in the collectivities ) , names 1/3 of members of the [ constitutional council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_council_\\ ( france \\ ) ) ( [ one of our supreme courts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judiciary_of_france ) ) , can grant a pardon ... ** [ results of the 2012 presidential elections ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rfzvtup.png ) ** -- #french legislative election ### * assembl\u00e9e nationale * ## sunday june , 11th 2017 and sunday june , 18th 2017 -- #election system ** cycle : ** every 5 years , shortly after the presidential elections unless the president dissolve national assembly . 
  ** voting system ** : [ two-round system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two-round_system ) in [ single seat-constituencies ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/french_constituency.svg ) directly by the citizens . 
  ** total numbers of seats ** : 577 * d\u00e9put\u00e9s * ** short summary ** : since [ 2002 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_constitutional_referendum,_2000 ) , the legislative elections take place 5 week after the presidential . 
  since 2002 , the president has always gathered a large majority in the lower house with his * win dynamics * . 
  the * assembl\u00e9e nationale * has much more power and responsibilities than the senate . 
  only the lower house can dismiss a gouvernement and vote the budget . 
  besides , in the case of a disagreement with the senate over laws , the gouvernement can decide to give the final decision to the lower house . 
  this power gives the national assembly a prominent role in the law-making process .
