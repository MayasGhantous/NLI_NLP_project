  are you that dense ? 
  i am `` he '' . 
  and i know you were n't ironic . 
  just plain silly saying that being grand alive is better than being euthanized . 
  you did n't read the article . 
  it says the ducks were euthanized before being burnt . 
  wow , literally the worst country on earth , the civilized way is to grind the males alive . 
   still not as good as the vanguard class names :  vanguard victorious vigilant vengeance pretty good , our triomphant class subs have pretty cool name too - le triomphant / the triumphant - le t\u00e9m\u00e9raire / the daring - le vigilant / the vigilant ( watchful ) - le terrible / the terrible ( meaning `` of a dreadful might '' ) we used to have funny/ridiculous name in the early xxth century ( pre wwi ) like thon ( tuna ) , grondin ( grunard ) or truite ( trout ) . 
  we have a whole new class of subs in construction too , the first one should be ready by 2017 . 
   and the censorship of the communist era was put in place by whom , the finns ? 
  you know , it 'll be easier to talk if you stop using strawmen . 
   akhmatova and chalamov are niche authors . 
  you sure use a lot of peremptory statement without any justification . 
  prokofiev & co `` journeymen '' , akhmatova and chalamov `` niche authors '' , what next , gogol `` meme-writer '' ? 
  i feel like i 'm on / lit / . 
  besides , my point still stands , replace akhmatova and chalamov by mandelstam and soljenitsyne if you feel they 're not worth your time . 
  inb4 `` gogol was ukrainian '', 
  pushkin , dosto\u00efevski , akhmatova and chalamov all lived in the same decade / s you would be right in saying that `` modern '' culture was late to bloom in russia , but saying that it all happened in a few years is just plain wrong . 
  you also have to take two things into account : massive censorship during much of the communist era , and the fact that so few russian authors are translated/easily available . 
  they have way more than a handful of those . 
  i hear russian regularly and can read some of it , so i know that i love the language . 
   russia has hot women and that seems to be the limit of their contribution to the current world . 
  i 'm sure every astronaut currently in the iss agrees with you . 
  the russian government is pretty tame compared to many in the world ( including many of our `` allies '' ) . 
  just do n't compare it to sweden . 
  also turgueniev , lermontov , varlam chalamov and more recently andrei makine ( though he writes in french ) . 
  one of the nicest sounding language there is . 
  top tier literature , and not just dosto\u00efevski and tolstoi . 
  top tier composers too . 
  really interesting history , especially from an `` history of ideas '' perspective . 
  larger than life characters so numerous , it 's not even funny . 
  beautiful nature ( though i 'm not really a nature guy ), 
  you 've been here for four month . 
  it 's been like that ( and even worse ) with russia for years . 
  are you seriously saying that the un ca n't pay fucking interns because it does n't have th money ? 
  it could n't work without them . 
  haha , my parents say this too when i go get food or a drink and forgot to ask them if they want something . 
  remember this when the un serves you its bull about how they are `` deeply committed to fight against unpaid labour '' . 
  fuck them . 
  haha nice one . 
  you 're comparing apples and oranges . 
  meh , estrella drinks itself just fine . 
  you godamn savages . 
   you do n't want to do business with french them backstabbing godless cowards am i right ? 
  i , too , think that there is way too much blacks in africa . 
  three strikes you 're out . 
  what 's everyone deal with `` they 're clumsy to read '' ? 
  do n't you know how to scroll down ? 
  do you use a 2 '' screen ? 
  in the end , it 's france that authorize the deal or not . 
  how so ? 
  they 're gon na get a shitload of money ( reimbursment of what they already paid + compensation for cancelling the contract ) while their engineers already got their hands on the technologies and technical know-how ( communication systems , combat management systems , etc ) . 
  at this point we 're just giving away free advanced warfare technologies to please other countries . 
  that 's just the list of russian wins , do n't get me started on the french losses . 
  that 's a nice win for russia . 
  free technologies , yay !, 
  heard it was done by edgy goth teens . 
  never been to warsaw but i thought krakow was meh, 
  sorry , i do n't read moonspeak, 
  i say we steal their gold to help me ( then glass switzerland for the laughs ) . 
  there are hundred of nationalities in the tour 's public . 
  what makes you thinks it was french people who spat on froome - besides the usual hatred of many british people toward us . 
  that 's some good old biased reporting . 
  he 's also know for being pro-european , anti torture and anti death penalty . 
   i never wrote he is a bad man . 
  i 'm just implying is catholic options might be close to putin , explaining the bias in his daughter 's article . 
  putin is not catholic . 
  plus hutin has been a constant supporter of the eu since ouest france campaigned in favour of maastricht . 
  that 's not the most putin friendly stance . 
   his second son , fran\u00e7ois r\u00e9gis hutin , studied at the `` [ mission de france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_catholic_territorial_prelature_of_mission_de_france ) '' before becoming journalist at ouest-france in 1961 . 
  he is now president and ceo , as well as a regular editorialist . 
  he is known for his catholic opinions . 
  that 's some good old biased reporting . 
  he 's also know for being pro-european , anti torture and anti death penalty . 
   and now we have an article from jeanne-emmanuelle hutin , one of fran\u00e7ois r\u00e9gis hutin 's daughters . 
  she is known for her bigoted position : she is [ opposed to gay marriage and adoption ] ( http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2012/08/14/homophobe-nauseabond-ledito-qui-ne-passe-pas-sur-le-mariage-homo-234617 ) and also opposed to halloween ( ca n't find an archived version of the edito , sorry ) . 
  you criticize ouest france for being biased and you cite rue89 . 
  haha . 
  finally you imply that ouest france is some fringe catholic extremist rag , when it is the largest daily newspaper ( before someone makes a comparison with the daily mail , we do n't have this kind of rags ) in france and is representative of social catholicism . 
  since someone is probably going to ask . 
  ouest france is a legit newspaper . 
  two years ago they were `` brave freedom fighters '' . 
  looks like the western media finally dropped them . 
  this is the most polish thing i 've read this month . 
  we have had special police units for decades . 
  probably half a century by now . 
   the weakening of france compared to germany is bad news . 
  france and germany are supposed to balance each others as two biggest powers of the eurozone ( as the uk does n't want to get involved ) . 
  this is no longer the case . 
  the most worrying thing is how the germans are deep-down persuaded of their own superiority , including from a moral point of view . 
   e tu brutus ? 
  ** e tu , brute ? 
  ** fucking plebs do n't even know their declensions . 
  damn , you guys are so fucking salty . 
  all this mumbo-jumbo between the brits and the eastern euros is delicious . 
  i guess that 's what happen when the bong 's mastery of banter meet the butthurt nature of eastern europeans . 
  `` suck my souvlaki angela ! '', 
  you mean l'agent raymond boltonne ? 
  that 's just some casual hunting . 
  people got to chill sometimes .
