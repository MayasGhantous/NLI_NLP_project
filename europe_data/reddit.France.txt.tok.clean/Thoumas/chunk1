i love tripoint monument like [ this one ] ( http://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/tripoint_basel_germany-france-switzerland.jpg ) i can run around and be in three different countries , and i have the f * cking right to stay as long as it please me . 
  that 's what europe is about , we became a whole and that 's awesome . 
  [ heeeey ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juran%c3%a7on_aoc ), 
  home : windows 7 work : windows xp in france and luxembourg . 
  what about a nice french helicopter carrier ? 
  anyone ? 
  if you buy one the second is at half price, 
  i grew up in the south west of france , lot of portuguese people here and i keep a lot of good memories with portuguese friends and their families . 
  in a few words . 
  pro : very welcoming people and always glad to help with workhouse . 
  con : ultra protective people with their families and circle of friends . 
  in general , portuguese are nice . 
  except on a football field , you guys become some bloody bastards when it comes to play football . 
  i was a referee for several years , teams with a majority of portuguese players had by far the worst mentality . 
  what 's the deal ? 
  it 's just a ball and some grass , jeez ... 
  it 's okay for me , it was just a joke and i laughed . 
  never fear to look up the boundaries of humor , transgress them and moke them , the world would be sad otherwise . 
  have a nice day !, 
  that was just a bad joke , he 's probably too high to realize that stereotype joke are never funny . 
  and nadine morano , she has a +5 bonus against hijab, 
  no , they were picnicking with grouchy while napoleon 's men were butchered . 
  he 's 22 , dropped medical school , dropped an accountant formation and he is now in law school , but for how long ? 
  the boy is just lost , he became muslim as he could have become mormon or shaolin monk . 
  i hope he 'll find some stability in his life, 
  he is n't suspended because he became muslim , he has been suspended because he sent a video praising the virtue of islam . 
  jordan bardella , the fn first secretary stated that `` religion is a private choice that i respect , but it should n't interfer with our political activities . 
  the video sent by maxime is unacceptable , therefore i decided to suspend him '', 
  they have one time zone in china ( beijing time ) , people in the west of the country do n't even bother with the official time and set their watchs to the time in pakistan . 
  in europe it would be the same , i do n't see why people in lithuania should set their watchs to london or paris time and change their habits . 
  when you absolutely need a standard , you use the [ universal time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_time ) , it 's worldwide and much more convenient . 
  when you need to schedule your everyday tasks , you use the time from an appropriate time zone . 
   my grandma do the same ... 
  but ... 
  i 'm too young to be old ... 
  i write `` centimes '' on my bank checks , never heard any complaints, 
  for christmas it 's better to go in alsace , [ the markets really have something magical  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kaysersberg+march%c3%a9+de+noel&amp;rlz=1c1chfx_frfr450fr450&amp;es_sm=122&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=r-apvmibl9jxauk-glak&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq ), 
  yep , you 're right . 
  i forgot to precise that , 
  in france the price is around 10 $ , it 's expensive but a part of that money is used to finance the french movie industry . 
  for me it 's a fair exchange , i pay a little extra and i can help my country to make good products internationally recognized . 
  how does * pew research * conduct their research ? 
  regarding religion , i have always seen a big gap between american and european results . 
  in france , pew research gives a population of 4.7 millions of muslims while french institute give 2.1 millions of muslim . 
  i do n't know which one is correct , the only things i can say is that counting religious people is a hard task , therefore these numbers are hard to interpret and sometimes lead to biased conclusion . 
  the ranking per traffic : 1 . 
  [ le monde ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/ ) 1 . 
  [ tf1.fr ] ( http://lci.tf1.fr/ ) 1 . 
  [ 20minutes . fr ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/ ) [ here ] ( http://owni.fr/2011/04/22/classement-des-sites-dinfo-francais/ ) is the source of the ranking .

  ~ ~ [ i knew it !, 
  ] ( http://images.tuxboard.com/d/22872-1/prince+harry+nazi.jpg ) ~ ~ edit : did n't read the article , now i feel stupid ... 
  i have mixed feelings , on the one hand they like our perfumes and on the other hand they consider cheese as a perfume . 
  screw it , i take that as a compliment, 
  okay map , i 'll wash my armpits . 
  but there 's no way that i shower every day, 
  we are also the ones being arrogant about our language, 
  i know you have good intention , you are curious about the incoming election but i do n't want to answer to your question . 
  it 's your vote , not mine . 
  i 'm afraid you 'll have to make your choice alone . 
  ^ ^ hint ^ ^ : ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ not ^ ^ fn, 
  maybe the water , or the food , or this kind of article is pure bullshit . 
  i do n't know any french ( even muslims ) who expect that france will become a muslim country . 
  edit : okay ... 
  i found the source of the 70 % in the french news . 
  it 's not 70 % of the french expect france will become a country under submission to islam , it 's 70 % of the french think that islam is incompatible with the values of the republic . 
  not quite the same, 
  russia is not our only supplier , but the part is big enough to be taken seriously ( thanks to / u/kohalikpagan for [ the data ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25mqdf/what_would_happen_if_russia_turned_of_the_gas_to/chiodra ) ) . 
  we 'll have to find new sources of energy ( mainly coal or nuclear power ) , maybe prematurely begin to extract shale gas on our soil which would be infortunate . 
  it was a competition ? 
  * to your corkscrew citizens * * pour wine in your glasses * * drink , drink * * let pure wine water our throats *, 
  i agree with you on that point , usa is far from us and it 's normal that americans have their own view of the world . 
  i do n't see that as `` living in a bubble '' , it 's a different point of view . 
  and usa is a damn big ass country , europe is just a little bit bigger . 
  since i 'm not good to place on a map all the american states i do n't mind if american ca n't place all european states on a map . 
  it should have been a concern in 2011 when the deal was made . 
  this contract was a stupid idea from the beginning and the international pressure was too shy back then . 
  unfortunately now it 's too late to go back , saint-nazaire 's shipyard need this contract to survive . 
  i hope [ this one ] ( http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/morning_call/2014/05/royal-caribbean-orders-4th-oasis-class-ship.html ) could provide enough funding to cover the loss of the russian contract but i do n't think so . 
  thank you , i would like to see more people singing in their native language . 
  personally i love how [ swedish sounds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnaeimq0tsg ) , i do n't have a clue about what they say and i do n't really care , musically it 's all good . 
  sorry for the announcer , we 'll try to teach him english . 
  how many are still active on the political scene ? 
  the french one , named `` ordre nouveau '' splited in 1978 into the `` front national '' ( nationalism , conservatism ) and `` parti des forces nouvelles '' ( neofascism ) which has been dissolved in the 90s . 
  i spotted `` uk vote romanian current mind '' what does that mean ? 
  i agree with myself to say he was a necessary evil . 
  he stabilized the country and created institutions that still last today ( [ court of audit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/court_of_audit_\\ ( france \\ ) ) , [ baccalaur\u00e9at ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baccalaur%c3%a9at ) , and more ) on the other hand he re-established slavery and sent a lot of young man died in unecessary wars . 
  the man we deserved , not the man we needed . 
  true , who the hell wants that ? 
  * what is your age and do you own a house ? 
  i 'm 25 and i 'm a student in a dual education system ( half-time in school half time at work ) . 
  i 'm currently renting a flat * do you expect that you will own a house sometime soon ? 
  i plan to buy a flat as soon as my professional situation become stable . 
  ( in two or three years , i hope ) the house will come later , first i need a family to house  * how 's the situation in your country in general . 
  you need a big amount of money to start with , bank do n't easily offer a loan . 
  however , we have some financial placement which help to gather money and give access to an interseting loan ( the pel `` plan d'\u00c9pargne logement '' * ownership saving scheme * ), 
  my favorite is this one from jean-pierre raffarin ( former prime minister )  [ `` win the yes needs the no , to win against the no '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv3l2y7uwnq ) what a poet, 
  no harm here , they just spin around and jump over , 
  hi , i was born and live in the south of france we practice bullfighting too . 
  i like certain forms of bullfighting where the bulls and cows are not armed , like the [ course landaise ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dwcps5ydjw ) ( louis ansolabehere is just an amazing jumper , i saw him a couple of time and i 've never been disappointed ) the spanish-style bullfighting in wich you refer in your question is an amazing spectacle , the ambiance , the music , the tense between the bull and the matador .
