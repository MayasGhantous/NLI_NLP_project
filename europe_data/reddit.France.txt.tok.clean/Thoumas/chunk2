  but , like a lot of people i ca n't stand the pain inflicted on the animal , it 's an old tradition wich , in my view , is ruining the show . 
  my grandparents are spanish , and they loves bullfighting , i do not begrudge them . 
  like an other redditor says here , `` you do n't argue with a 80 year old man that has been in a civil war '' . 
  you are right , it was what i meant . 
  i 'd rather live in my old `` communist '' french country than the other side of the atlantic . 
  come on , i just want to be nice on the internet ... is that a crime ? 
  i know , this is my response to him   nobody , i wanted to point out that when a country is important for this sub , we can see its flag . 
  we all love usa here and most of the redditors are american , so it 's normal to find american flag as a flair . 
  israel is in the round table of the week , so this country is important during this week . 
   that 's all , i did n't mean to offense , it was just a joke ,

  well , they are in the uefa . 
  wich mean not very much ... ^ ^ plizz ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ tryinn btw , how do you justify your american flag ? 
  that 's right , a lot of old french people like to pay with check . 
  we ca n't change an old habit  on the other hand , i 've never seen a 500 $ euro banknote and rarely a 200 $ . 
  i 've heard these were created because the germans like high denomination , are they common in germany ? 
  we use them in france , i use check to pay my doctor and my landlord . 
  do n't be sorry , all the european powers are at fault . 
  with a [ crazy arms race prior to 1914 ] ( http://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/arms_race_prior_to_1914_armament_policy ) and the [ cult of the offensive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cult_of_the_offensive ) as main battle plan , western front was meant to be a human and ecological disaster . 
  mcdonald is a huge success in france , they are well implanted and are doing a great job to understand the expectation of french consumers . 
  edit : [ more information here ] ( http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/born-in-the-usa-made-in-france-how-mcdonalds-succeeds-in-the-land-of-michelin-stars/ ), 
  that reminds me of [ this game ] ( https://greatlanguagegame.com/ ), 
   that infrastructure was n't built and exclusively used by the terrorists . 
  yes i know , but they are currently using it to support their war effort , so it 's in our best interest to destroy it . 
  even if those infrastructure were used or could potentially be used by our allies in the future . 
   they are successful because they provide infrastructure and administration previously unseen in those regions . 
  yes you are right to recall that , they even plan to introduce [ their own currency in the region ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-claims-to-mint-gold-and-silver-coins-for-currency-free-from-satanic-global-economy-10342632.html ) . 
  they are clearly not an other terrorist group waging war with disorganized guerilla , they are building a state with the north-korea kind of craziness . 
  that 's why i think it 's important to destroy their economy and the infrastructure they are building and using . 
   the western plans all seem to conveniently ignore that and just happily bomb the infrastructure and then give the people their utterly broken country back , wondering why they are n't thankful . 
  that 's not convenient , it 's always sad to bomb a region and destroy everything . 
  if there was a more effective solution with less destruction , i 'm sure almost everybody will be ok with it . 
  i 'm sorry it may be an inappropriate comparison , but during wwii france was heavily bombed by allied forces . 
  those bombing were essential to weaken axis forces and insure victory , even if the cost was the destruction of french infrastructure and death of civilians . 
  i do n't think anyone in france hold a grudge on american or british for that and i 'm sure iraqi and syrian civilians are aware those bombing are necessary to repel isis . 
   not to mention that the west refuses to support full kurdish independence , despite a free kurdistan likely being a far better option as a `` stability anchor '' in the middle east then continued reliance on only saudi arabia and israel . 
  yes , it 's a sensitive issue . 
  kurds claims territory in syria and iraq , but they also claim territory in turkey and iran . 
  we ca n't fully support a kurdish independence without negatively affect our relations with iran and turkey . 
  we really need to improve our relation with iran , they could become an important economic partner . 
  and we ca n't afford to lose turkey , they are a too precious ally against russia . 
  it 's more about destroying infrastructures , vehicles , disrupting supply lines and communication . 
  without a good organization they will be less effective and will lose ground to local forces, 
  poor education system , from kindergarten to the end of the secondary education we take english classes in large groups ( ~ 25-30 students for 1 teacher ) . 
  we learn the grammar , conjugation and basic vocabulary but we almost never have a chance to express ourselves in english and improve our written/oral expression . 
  what he meant was that french internet is big enough to have access to a lot of content without the use of english . 
  i could do my browsing exclusively in french , i would n't lack of anything and still have access to quality content . 
  of course internet is a better experience if you speak english , nobody denies that . 
  i do n't know why , by law they should n't be authorised to held a conference with a `` wife beating '' topic .

  i like the taste of the orxata but i find it a bit sickening,

  he probably can not complain, 
  because they probably ca n't speak english . 
  english classes suck in france and if they are young and/or do n't learn english by themselves or in a private institution , they probably ca n't understand anything beside basic vocabulary and swearing, 
  sure , russia is powerful but they do n't have the capacity to fully deploy their forces directly against france , thus they are not an immediate threat . 
  before knocking the french doors they will have to go through poland and germany , a long and difficult trip which give plenty of time to rearm the country and plan a strong defense . 
  he said that it is misleading because the poll never talk about the ban but about how people feel about the burkini . 
  i think the burkini should n't have its place on our beach , so my answer to the poll would be `` yes i 'm opposed to the burkini '' . 
  but i also think a ban is too much and restrict freedom so i 'm also opposed to the ban . 
  i just use my personal experience to demonstrate that the title could be misleading , because the poll does not exactly show how people feel about the ban . 
  yet the title still state that people opposed to the burkini are also favorable to the ban , which is very wrong . 
  after the invasion of poland the german polish were considered as regular german citizen and joined the army like any other german citizen of the reich , even if they had a polish citizenship before the war . 
  there were also ethnic poles who had german citizenship before the war and they were also drafted in the army , some were happy to be a part of the german reich , some defected and joined the allies as soon as they had the opportunity . 
  as for polish poles , i do n't really know , nazis considered them as subhuman and you may be right the number of volunteers may be close to 0 . 
  so if you want to count how many ex-polish citizen were willfuly fighting for germany , that 's a lot of them since ethnic germans were integrated in the empire as regular citizen . 
  if you want to count how many ethnic poles were willfully fighting for germany , that 's a lot less but they still existed since ethnic poles were part of the reich before the war . 
  poland territory under the reich had a special status and it 's hard to compare it to france , belgium or danemark . 
  they were some , but the french opinion and p\u00e9tain did n't really like the idea of french people waging germany 's wars . 
  hitler was reluctant too , he approved the creation of french volunteers corps and their integration in the german army but he did n't want to be accountable to the french government ( vichy france was meant to stay neutral after all ) . 
  so in 1941 a few weeks after the beginning of the invasion of ussr the lvf ( * `` l\u00e9gion des volontaires fran\u00e7ais '' * , legion of french volunteers ) was created . 
  at first french officials hoped for 100 000 french to join the rank but at its best the lvf included 6 500 men , which make france the occupied country who sent the least number of volunteers to germany . 
  french men also enlisted in various german army branches , mainly nskk and kriegsmarine . 
  it 's estimated that around 40 000 french men willfuly served under the german flag , roughly the same number of french enlisted in the free french forces before operation torch . 
  after the succesful allied invasion of north africa , the french african army merged with the free french forces and their number greatly exceeded the french volunteers enlisted in the german ranks and was in constant augmentation . 
   that 's nice an all but can they do this wow , that 's a really impressive stunt . 
  maybe they can do it if they try to , they are some of the most skilled pilots in the world and can do impressive stunts . 
  you should watch some of their videos if you enjoy aerobatics . 
  for the rest of your comment , i think you tried to be satiric and i though it was funny ( i laughed at the lafayette bit ) . 
  i 'm sorry for the people who call you dumb or ignorant . 
  rusted rifles i think , wooden parts decayed long ago so only the barrel and other metalic parts are left . 
  he touched the ball first but he was solely focused on the ball and not on the physical duel , he ignored the duel , which is a part of the action and this is the problem i have . 
  he should have gone shoulder to shoulder against giroud first and then punch the ball away . 
  done like that , they are bot engaged in an aerial duel and when giroud push his arm the foul is obvious . 
  instead he ignored the physical contact and it become harder for the referee to sanction giroud in favor of a player who do n't follow the flow of the game . 
  i think romania deserved the draw , they did a better first half imo , they reacted fast after the first goal and did n't make big mistakes during the whole game . 
  payet was in a top form and that 's what saved the french . 
   there is no such thing in the rules as `` intensity of a duel '' you just follow the flow of the game , the player who refuse to play the game is at disavantage .
