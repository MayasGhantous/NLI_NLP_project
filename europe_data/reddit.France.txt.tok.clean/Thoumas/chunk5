  i think it 's good for your health , i also ran from time to time . 
  why would you kiss the ground ? 
  take back the statue of liberty , put a veil on it and sell it to the saudi , they 'll love that . 
  carve de gaulle , napol\u00e9on , louis xiv and g\u00e9rard depardieu 's faces on mount rushmore . 
  ban american movie industry and feed the people with shitty `` film d'auteur '' replace every gun store with authentic boulangerie . 
  you should have directly asked about isra\u00ebl if this is what you are interested about . 
  right now your question is confusing , you put an emphasis on native american but you want to talk about isra\u00ebl and you try to make a comparison between the two . 
  modern day isra\u00ebl and the sad encounter between western people and native american are two topics completely different and i also have a hard time to understand what you really want to know or what point you are trying to make . 
  well , it 's surprising to me that clubs are a thing at all \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  students are not government employees but public schools are owned by the government , so you 're not allowed to use them to start or advertise a religious themed club . 
  first of all , clubs in french schools are not really a thing . 
  and due to our sacrosanct secularism every religious related matters are not really welcome in public schools .

  because the last time a war started in the balkan the whole continent became crazy and was set ablaze . 
  it was definitely an improvement of the situation . 
  yes but they did not vaporize , they are still around there and are giving instructions to their voters . 
  they are also preparing the parlementiary election coming soon , this election will be important to determine what the next governement will be made of . 
  who were the other 9 candidates in the american election ? 
  i may have missed that since our political background/history is so similar . 
  from my point of vue it looks more like the 2002 election , when we ended up with a second round chirac vs le pen ( father ) , starring : * macron as chirac ( comes from the last government and not really liked ) * marine le pen as her father ( populist , run on people fears and concerns about where the country is going ) * m\u00e9lenchon as jospin ( leftist , able to bring something new but failed close to the goal because the left vote was divided ) . 
  but hey , does france looks more like itself 15 years ago or more like a country on the other side of the ocean with a completely different political background , a completely different voting habits , a completely different voting system and completely different f * cking everything ? 
  tough question . 
   would you say that american football is significantly growing in popularity in europe ? 
  significantly , no . 
  there 's a league in france though , the fffa ( * f\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise de football am\u00e9ricain * ) . 
  there 's around 200 clubs in france and ~ 20.000 registered players , those numbers are growing veeeery slowly . 
   if an nfl game was played near you , would have any desire to attend ? 
  i do n't really know , i would say yes because i 'm curious to see how a live game happen and what kind of show there 's around the game . 
  but not because i have a real interest for american football or nfl . 
  ah yes , [ la chancla !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmij9aklvog ), 
  only when i 'm alone around babies , i love blowing on their faces . 
  they all have this stupid reaction when they shake their arms in the air and are like `` whadafuckishappeningomagadomagad-oh that was funny '' . 
  it also helps to boost their immune system , so it 's a win-win . 
  i 'm not that triggered , i always find it funny when people overestimate our ability to communicate in english  i 'm only speaking about the french part when i say that . 
  i do n't think `` language-smugness '' is really a thing and to be honest it 's really surprising and somehow offensive that it 's taught in school . 
  sure we take a lot of pride in our language but people do not become grumpy when they hear about english lessons , nobody will think that teaching english is stupid and useless . 
  it 's just that french take so much place in our daily lifes , almost everything is available in french , movies : dubbed , books : translated , internet : good enough chunk available in french , etc. 
  so if you do n't make an extra effort to actually learn english and seek english content you 'll quickly no longer have any extended contact with english and forget what school taught you . 
  and when this norwegian tourist start babbling in english your average french citizen find himself dumbfounded , try the few english words his brain remember , then realize that he ca n't properly understand nor communicate and just give up with english , what you may perceive as being unwilling . 
  to put it in a few words , we suffer more from a `` language-lazyness '' rather than pure smugness . 
  all the germans i met spoke enough english or french to handle an easy conversation , so for me it 's english . 
   it always baffles me how little english and/or how ** unwilling ** most people are to speak with me when i speak english i 'm a little bit triggered by the `` unwilling '' part , i do n't think you realize how bad french people are with english . 
  and i think that the few that actually speak , even a little bit of english , will gladly help you , not for the sake of helping but just to showboat about their amazing english skills . 
  burger , sushi , couscous , etc. 
  with websites like `` just eat '' you can have pretty much anything . 
  i do n't recall seeing a bar with nba games on tv . 
  i think nba games in france are broadcasted by bein , if you find a bar with tv screens there 's a good chance they have bein and you can try to ask the bartender to show the game . 
  but if a football game is on ( from any western european leagues ) , the odds are clearly not in your favor . 
  i 'm not sure about the communism part , when ( if ) we 'll master space travel to the point where we can easily move people and goods across the galaxy/universe it means that we basically have access to infinite ressources . 
  in this context i think a society drive by private interest and seeking more and more growth could potentially become much more prosperous than a `` communist '' one . 
  but i 'm all fired up for automated homosex in space . 
  you can consult the last europol report regarding terrorism in europe . 
  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/european-union-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-te-sat-2016 incident related to jihadism does not constitute most of the attack , but they are by far the deadliest and rightly mobilize most of our efforts . 
  in 2015 , on the 1077 people arrested 687 were related to jihadist terrorism . 
  so a comfortable majority . 
  but i give you that we tend to underestimate ( sometimes forget ) non-jihadist terrorism , mainly because the scale and the devastation let by jihadism kind of `` steal the spotlight '' . 
  yeah this is what i thought , just a few nutjobs with no real power nor influence, 
  there 's a few people considering that a fusion between france and wallonia could be a good idea ( iirc marine le pen for instance was not against the idea in 2011 when belgium was in bad shape ) . 
  i think the movement is stronger in belgium , but they are still a very small minority . 
  the super bowl is broadcasted live , but i think more because it 's a huge show rather than a real interest for handegg, 
  i ca n't say france is going wrong , we have a pretty good standard of living and overall a nice economy . 
  like / u/mostoriginalnickname ( spanish ) said in this thread `` most of us would love to have your economy '' . 
  it 's just that the general feeling is that things are , i would say , stagnant . 
  we do n't feel like we 're going anywhere , we do n't feel like we are making progress . 
  we are living in a country slowed down by an inefficient and deeply flawed political/administrative system when everything is going fast around us ( putin trying to reboot the cold war , proxy wars in middle-east , usa going far right , brexit , etc ) . 
  we feel that our current system has run its course and we desperately need a change , the two historic major political parties ( ps , benoit hamon & * les r\u00e9publicains * , fran\u00e7ois fillon ) are not going well and people are now considering more extreme solution ( le pen , m\u00e9lenchon ) or a freelance outsider ( macron ) to run the country . 
  so yeah , france is , for now , going well economically and socially but deep inside we know that it will not last long and we need to react fast . 
  and the awaited reaction is taking a long time to come , this last ten years a financial crisis , rise of terrorism and a painful divorce between eu and uk were needed to realise that no , things are not going that well and we need to adapt and find new solutions . 
  which is highly frustating . 
  you 're right , i could n't think of any traditional song known in the whole country so i just went with these ones, 
  it happened to my sister , she was working as a cashier in a small market on the atlantic coast during summer so she had to deal with a lot of tourists struggling in french . 
  but this encounter was the cherry on the cake , it was the end of her shift she was tired af and this couple of sunburned british came in . 
  they wanted sugar , the french word is `` sucre '' . 
  they were roaming in the aisle trying to find the white gold but could n't find any . 
  and they did the only thing a reasonable human being would do . 
  they both looked at my sister and repeated `` ucre , ucre . 
  ucre ? '', 
  it was like two neanderthals discovering modern civilisation , she just cracked up . 
  i doubt this one was ever heard outside of the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  it 's just that when we ear `` american chocolate '' we think about hershey and its distinctive taste of vomit . 
  first one : https://www.youpak.com/watch?v=l11gyqvu_-o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33 second one : https://www.youpak.com/watch?v=smnsszvwkde and if you need me i 'll be on strike the whole week to protest against this blatant injustice . 
  au vent . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l11gyqvu_-o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33 ) love you ireland < 3 this one should work in the whole country , more specifically in my region it would be this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smnsszvwkde it 's the story of a sheperd roaming in the pyrenees and finding `` love '' in every village, 
  and when it 's not forests , it 's lakes, 
  it 's a beautiful place , an elegant mix between latin and germanic europe , it has everything , but do n't you dare showing interest in it you fucking pleb i 'm gon na murder you and your pathetic family we have mastered smugness at a point it 's considered as a lethal weapon you 're done walk away while you still can go back to your fucking craphole and if i see you around one more time i 'll nuke your ass back to middle-age . 
  something like that , we also have fine wines and we like to show our arts to foreigners . 
  dude , belgians were not the only one fighting in belgium ... [ 4 french armies and the british expeditionary forces were also here to hold the line ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_belgium_order_of_battle ) , the belgian front was critical for the defense of france ( like it was during ww1 ) and of course once the belgian-french-british forces failed to hold it france quickly followed . 
  i never said leboncoin.fr was the main spot for all , just for real estate . 
  if you are looking for a job or a car in france it 's better to go to dedicated websites . 
  edit : my first comment was confusing , i understand why you were thinking that , my bad . 
   in the usa where there are dedicated services for each thing . 
  you have craigslist in the us , with a few clicks i just found a [ home ] ( https://cnj.craigslist.org/apa/6032172352.html?lang=en&amp;cc=gb ) , a [ car ] ( https://cnj.craigslist.org/cto/6013289584.html?lang=en&amp;cc=gb ) and a [ job ] ( https://cnj.craigslist.org/egr/6036684275.html?lang=en&amp;cc=gb ) in new jersey ( us here i come ! ) . 
  websites with general purpose are not at all an european specificity , i think craigslit was the first to propose this kind of service and european websites are just copy/pasting what was done in the us . 
  in france like in every developed country you 'll find websites with general purposes ( leboncoin.fr , paruvendu.fr , etc ) and websites with dedicated services ( seloger.com for homes , lacentrale.fr for cars , apec.fr for jobs , etc ), 
  for basque , yes the vast majority would be produce in spain . 
  when i said occitan i was talking about the [ specific dialect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occitan_language ) spoken in france , it 's very close to catalan but there 's enough difference ( notably in writing and pronunciation ) to consider `` french occitan '' and `` catalan '' as two different languages part of a big `` occitan '' family . 
  giving that this occitan dialect is mainly spoken in france most of the content is produced in france . 
  but of course , catalan and `` french occitan '' speakers can easily understand each other and benefit from both spanish and french works . 
  [ leboncoin.fr ] ( https://www.leboncoin.fr/ventes_immobilieres/offres/aquitaine/occasions/?th=1&amp;parrot=0 ) ( litteraly translated , thegoodcorner ) is , i think , the biggest french website for homes purchases .
