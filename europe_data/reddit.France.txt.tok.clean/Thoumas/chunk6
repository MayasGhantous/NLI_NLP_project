  it 's so 20th century, 
   no , ivy league universities do . 
  the rest of them are pretty mediocre and wo n't impress anyone more than a european university . 
  mit , caltech , greendale , berkeley or even stanford ( you mentionned it ) also hold a lot of prestige and will definitely impress any european . 
  you 're a little bit unfair to them when you say that only ivy league matters ,

  almost ten years ago there were a compilation of facts about bernard mendy ( he played for psg at the time ) . 
  http://www.cahiersdufootball.net/article-the-bernard-mendy-facts-2745 he 's an okay player and a lot of is talents depended on his powerful plays and his exceptional physical fitness . 
  iirc the meme started after one of his game with the national team against brazil when [ roberto carlos witnessed the `` mendy '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llaf1kdbevm ) . 
  here 's some of my favorites : * the constellation of orion is just the result of bernard mendy 's 3 minutes corner kick training session . 
  * the movement of tides are due to bernard mendy 's defensive placement * bernard mendy would be handsome with [ ronaldo 's 2002 haircut ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/18/article-0-0052f47000000258-327_308x389.jpg ) * bernard mendy can do a one-two with himself * even on table football bernard mendy can do a sliding tackle followed by a deep forward pass * like the chicago bulls retired the number 23 , psg decided to retire the name bernard mendy,

  of course , this is what i meant when i said `` secure food and clean water '', 
  first i 'll go on strike to show that i 'm not really happy with all of this apocalypse thing . 
  then , after a 2 to 3 weeks period i 'll try to negociate with the apocalypse leader ( zombie king , cthulhu , etc ) to make sure that i wo n't lose any social benefits , i will suffer no salary loss and that this so-called apocalypse is not an excuse to outsource my job to china . 
  once this is settled i 'll seek shelter , secure food and clean water , gather as many guns as possible and shoot at things for funsies .

  from the latest figures i can find : * incineration : 30 % * landfills : 36 % * recycling : 20 % * composting/anaerobic digestion : 14 % ( source in french : http://www.cniid.org/les-dechets-en-france-quelques-chiffres,151 ) i think we have a lot of progress to make and it should be an important focus for the next decades , if we do n't make more efforts we 're going to miss the goal set by the eu : http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/target_review.htm, 
  hi , you seem to be one of the rare person here to think that and i 'm really curious to know why . 
  could you please elaborate your point ? 
  ( i 'm not pissed nor trying to tease you because you have a different opinion , i just think it would be interesting to have more details ), 
   only dangerous one in france metropolitan france , if you count guyane you can find big boys like [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goliath_birdeater ), 
  [ loire valley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c3%a2teaux_of_the_loire_valley ) if you are into rennaissance castles . 
  there is also a lot of really good [ vineyard ] ( http://www.vinsvaldeloire.fr/ ) and of course good food , 
  fillon want to steal votes away from le pen not because he 's scared , because this is where there 's voters to steal . 
  french presidential elections are in two rounds , first round with every candidates ( ~ 15 candidate this year maybe ) . 
  then a second round with the two better candidates . 
  in a situation where the second round is far-right vs someone else french people will vote for this someone else ( like in 2002 when [ chirac got a landslide victory against le pen with 82 % votes for him ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002 ) ) . 
  so the candidate who ends up against le pen in the second round know it 's a very probable win . 
  since le pen has great chances to go to the second round , the only thing fillon has to do in order to win is to be against her and for that he needs to steal some votes . 
  liberalist votes will be harder to secure this year ( because of macron and the ps who are competing to secure those votes ) so i think it 's a smart and ballsy move from the conservatives to steal le pen voters . 
  due to french presidential election process and french voting habits ( blocking the far-right no matter who 'll be the next president ) , here chances are close to 0 . 
   i found that in europe , especially germany and france , that it seems anybody and everybody over the age of 15 is a smoker . 
  well according to the last poll around 33 % of french people are regular smoker . 
  it 's less than in the us ( ~ 20 % american are smoker ) but it 's far from `` everybody over the age of 15 '' . 
  i read somewhere that in western europe we are a lot more open about smoking in public , while in the us people tend to hide the fact that they are smoker . 
  i do n't remember the source and i do n't know if it 's a serious claim but if it 's true it may be why you have a flawed impression on the number of smoker in france and germany . 
  well , it depends on everyone 's taste and i do n't think one lifespan is enough to experience and fairly compare every european cuisine . 
  that being said , i think italian cuisine is the most widespread and easily accessible in europe , they have tasty , `` easy-to-go '' and customizable dishes ( you can never be wrong with pizza or pasta , no matter where you are in europe ) and alongside a several millenia old culinary tradition that can surprise you with sophisticated or simple recipe . 
  if you do n't know european cuisine at all , italian is a nice introduction . 
  from there you can move to spanish or greek if you like the mediterranean touch , or go through the alps and discover french terroir or sweet and savory german cuisine . 
   anyways , i do n't think any of the countries in the eu joined for selfless reasons , why would they if there were n't anything to gain from it ? 
  that 's very true , we can say that the main goal of the eu is to be selfish together , 
   is there any chance to gain permanent status in a european country for a us citizen that is not some sort of international financier ? 
  yes , learn the language , find a job and stay long enough without causing trouble , that should work . 
   my family came from sweden 150 years ago , will they take me back ? 
  nope, 
  donald trump is happening, 
  a lot , right now there 's three big parties : * ** parti socialiste ** ( socialist party ) , social democratism . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande , the elected president and the current government are all `` socialist '' . 
  they 'll pick a candidate for next election in january 2017 . 
  * ** les r\u00e9publicains ** ( the republican ) , liberal conservatism . 
  they pick this name in 2015 , if you followed french politics in the past years they were known as ** ump ** , ** u ** nion pour un ** m ** ouvement ** p ** opulaire ( union for a popular movement ) , nicolas sarkozy , our former president , come from here . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon is their canditate . 
  * ** front national ** ( national front , damn french is so easy ) , nationalism . 
  marine le pen is a name you probably heard if you follow european politics , this is her party . 
  they are in a steady rise of power since 2002 ( when jean-marie le pen , marine 's father , came second in the presidential election ) and are now a strong candidate for the coming election . 
  there is also smaller parties , i do n't think they have enough power to win a big election but they are still big enough and their voices can make a big change : * ** parti de gauche ** ( left party ) , democratic-socialism , led by jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon . 
  * ** parti communiste fran\u00e7ais ** ( french communist party ) , communism , led by pierre laurent . 
  * ** europe \u00e9cologie les verts ** ( europe ecology , the green ) , ecology , led by ... themselves . 
  ** ( forward !, 
  ) , social-liberalism , led by emmanuel macron , former minister of the economy and member of the socialist party . 
  * ** mouvement d\u00e9mocrate ** ( democratic movement ) , social-liberalism , led by fran\u00e7ois bayrou . 
  and of course there 's more , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2017 ) you can follow who will be at the next presidential election . 
   i wonder if it means someone could get into office with less than 30 % of the vote . 
  in france you ca n't , our presidential elections have two rounds . 
  first round with every candidate , everybody vote , the two best move to the next round . 
  second round , everybody vote and the one above 50 % win the election . 
  yep , it 's quite common in france and imo it really helps the far right and other euro-sceptic parties . 
  older people often do the conversion euro/franc to complain about how expensive are everyday items . 
  `` wow a baguette costs 1 $ , it 's 6f50 !, 
  before the euro it was only 4f , they are totally ripping us ! '', 
  i understand that for them it makes more sense , they grew up with the franc and it 's what make sense for them ( like someone who grew up with imperial system and stumble upon something using metric system , they have to convert it or it 'll be hard to visualize ) . 
  but they forgot to adjust with inflation , since 2000 prices rised and so did our salary , our lifestyle also greatly improved and we spend money on more shit . 
  so they are locked with old prices from 2000 because it 's the last benchmark that make sense for them and do n't realize that if the franc was still around they 'll have baguettes for 6f50 . 
  this comment includes franc and french people complaining about baguette price , it 's probably the frenchiest thing i wrote on reddit so far . 
  and i think you 're a lot more pessimistic than i am . 
  first generation often have a higher birth rate than natives ( due to cultural differences between france and their countries ) but the next generation tend to normalize and blend with the natives . 
  we have millions of maghrebi since the 1960 's , since then we have had politician talking shit about how their exceptional birthrate are going to surpass the native french population but we are still waiting for it ... with the new migration waves the proportion of non-european people in the french population will certainly rise up , but a full `` takeover '' is more a far-right fantasy than a reality . 
   do you believe your countries will survive as european states in the following century ?
