  yes , in 2116 we 'll probably be at our 8th or 9th republic , maybe an empire or a restoration of the monarchy if things got crazy but france will still be around . 
   does the importation of millions of third world people concern you ? 
  not really , it 's not the first mass immigration to france ( russian in the 1920 's , spanish in 1940 's , maghrebi in the 50 's and 60 's and more ) and it wo n't be the last . 
  people are coming in france , some are staying some are leaving , it leads to some changes and sometimes some clashes but it never killed the country and i do n't think it will . 
  so , do you ever ask yourself , why do / u/nochanfam hates you ? 
  refugees do n't kill people , people kill people, 
  oh , i did n't know it was called artificial  yes it seems that green clay behavior is somewhere between a hard court and red clay ( at least according to [ this thread ] ( https://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/index.php?threads/red-clay-vs-green-clay.97286/ ) ) . 
  i would love to see more tournament played on it in the future , a new surface could add more challenge . 
  it 's made with different materials ( i do n't know what the recipe is ) , i think the american company [ har-tru is the only one manufacturing it ] ( http://hartru.com/har-tru-surfaces/green-clay ) . 
  there 's not a lot of tournament played on green clay ( i think [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charleston_open ) is the only one ) and it seems you can find those courts only in the us . 
  turkey and russia , right now their chances are somewhere between 0 % and 0.01 % . 
  maybe in a distant future we 'll find a solid common ground and we 'll build a stronger relationship , but right now it seems impossible . 
  armenia , azerbaijan and georgia are members of the [ eastern partnership ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_partnership ) ( alongside belarus , moldova and ukraine ) since 2009 . 
  this partnership aims to improve political and economical relations between the eu and those countries . 
  so there 's a good work basis but there have been no concrete steps as of today . 
  i think around 20 % of the courts are red clay courts and 80 % are hard courts . 
  grass courts are very rare and green clay ( fun fact : in france we call it `` american clay '' ) are non-existent . 
  number one is obviously football . 
  but it 's hard to tell who come second or third in the whole country , it depends on the region . 
  i guess collective sports usually got bigger fanbase , so rugby , basketball and handball would be the most watched . 
  tennis is also very popular in france ( with 1,100,000 members it 's the second sports played in a club after football 2,130,000 members ) . 
  yes there is some thruth . 
  there 's two big trade union in france , cgt ( conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail / / general confederation of labour ) and cfdt ( conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail / / french democratic confederation of labour ) . 
  cfdt was once part of a christian trade union , the cftc ( conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise des travailleurs chr\u00e9tiens / / french confederation of christian workers ) . 
  they broke up in 1964 but the cfdt kept the same social doctrine , they believe a relationship of trust can be establish between employees and employers , so they tend to look for a compromise and try to avoid the conflict . 
  they are however on strike from time to time , it 's still a french trade union \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  cgt on the other hand , they have more an history of revolutionary syndicalism , they have a strong culture of conflict and they strongly believe the power balance favor the employers . 
  so , for them , negociating a common ground will automatically disfavour the workers in the long run . 
  that 's why a compromise is sometimes a taboo word in their mouth . 
  of course i 'm oversimplyfying , the reality is much more complex than that . 
  there is more trade union with various ideologies , but some union are `` softer '' than others and they do not necessarily seek the same kind of agreement with the managment and governement . 
  the automatic going on strike when something do n't please us . 
  do n't get me wrong , i love living in a free country where i can express my disapproval by going on strike , protest and not being afraid of the consequences . 
  but it 's too much , strikes are losing their power , when the sncf ( national railway company ) goes on strike the first thing that come to our mind is not `` what happened ? 
  why are they upset ? '', 
  ( like it should be ) , the first thing that come is `` oh ffs !, 
  again ?! '' . 
  it feels like there 's no dialogue between union and governement , new law =  everbody is deaf =  automatic strike =  and now we can talk . 
  and commoners are in the middle hoping it 'll end quickly and the next strike wo n't happen when we 'll book an overpriced train trip . 
  those questions are really specific and far away from being `` simple european history , geography , or current events '' as op asked . 
  someone majoring in european history may know the answers but it 's not common knowledge ... 
  that 's odd , maybe u/bougnette is right it depends where you come from . 
  i 've lived mostly in aquitaine and lorraine , * hollandais * seemed like it was `` the norm '' . 
  yep , busted !, 
  now help me find this f * cking game it 's driving me nuts, 
  you need to define what you mean by `` developped '' and europe , because you 're not making a lot of sense right now . 
  it reminds me a game , i think it was named something like `` detroit or third world country ? 
  '' , a random picture pop on screen and we have to tell if it 's a picture from detroit or from somewhere in the third world . 
  if someone know about it it would be nice . 
  netherlands as holland : quite often , i think 50 % of the time people say * hollande * ( holland ) and the other 50 % they say * pays-bas * ( netherlands ) . 
  in contrast when we refer to dutch people most of the time we say * hollandais/hollandaise * ( people from holland ) instead of * n\u00e9erlandais / n\u00e9erlandaise * ( people from netherlands ) . 
  uk as england : i think it 's a common mistake here too , if something is british and it 's not specified where it come from then we 'll assume it 's from england . 
  most of the people know there 's a difference between england , wales , scotland and northern ireland ( i already met someone who thought the union jack was the english flag and did n't know about the one with the st george 's cross , but it 's not really common ) but it 's an easy shortcut to say british = english . 
  americans as `` yankees '' : never , maybe you can hear it in old movies but `` yankees '' is not really in use anymore . 
  your nicknames will be * ricain * ( murican ) or * amerloque * . 
  an angrily worded letter ** in german **, 
  the guys behind [ factorio ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio ) are also from czech republic . 
  czech sure have a thing for awesome engineering game , 
  i also liked endless space and endless space 2 seems promising, 
  [ looks like you have a new arch-enemy ] ( http://cdn0.lostateminor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pineapple-pizza-girl.jpg ), 
  belgium i think , in a lot of joke belgian are depicted as stupid or with an absurd behavior . 
  i do n't know where does those jokes exactly come from , maybe french northerners who were teasing their neighbours . 
  and [ coluche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coluche ) ( one of the top french humorist in the 70 ' and 80 ' ) popularize and spread the stereotype in the whole country . 
  thank you i appreciate that , but i 'm just a military enthusiast . 
  i like to follow news related to current military deployment , war industry , army contracts , etc. 
  but i 'm far away from being a specialist on the matter , even if i try to do a lot of fact-checking before writing something i 'm not immune to bring incorrect facts or say something stupid so take everything i say with a grain of salt \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
   why are there still american military bases in ( almost ) every country in europe ? 
  they are not in almost every european country , they are in some european country . 
  their presence was justified first by the need to occupy axis country in the post ww2 world ( hence the strong bases in germany and italy ) , then to counter the threat of soviet union and now those bases act as a useful strongpoint to help us project their forces in middle-east and asia . 
  and since nato headquarters are in belgium it make sense that us deploy troops around there . 
  there is also a joint task forces between us , romanian and bulgarian forces since 2007 to strengthen the relations between those countries . 
   and have any of you had any negative experiences with our brave american boys in your cities/towns ? 
  not really , in 1966 charles de gaulle asked brave lyndon johnson to pull brave american troops out of the country , so brave american military personnel are not common around there . 
  i think there is some brave military staff in embassies and to bravely coordinate joint exercises but not much . 
   also , do you think it 's weird that there are american soldiers that still occupy your `` free and independent '' country ? 
  first , why the brackets ? 
  european countries are free and independent , there is no doubt about that . 
  i do n't think the military presence is weird per se , we are allied , our military goals are common most of the time and those bases help you to achieve your goals ( our goals ) in middle-east and asia . 
  i just think your military presence is a bit overpowered for the mission . 
  of course russia showing its teeth and grabing clay in ukraine is not a good sign and it 's nice of the us to show solidarity by strengthening its position in [ eastern europe ] ( https://www.army.mil/article/177770/department_of_the_army_announces_3rd_armored_brigade_combat_team_4th_infantry_division_deployment ) , but i doubt it 's really necessary , i 'm confident european forces alone are able to deter any russian incursion in the baltic . 
  you pain au retic, 
  do n't listen to this filthy liar , you 're supposed to say * chocolatine *, 
  french people also have 1-2 $ in their cars but it 's for the emergency baguette, 
  i do n't understand what do you mean by that :  completely clueless that the `` russian alphabet '' is not russian ; what is your point exactly ? 
  yes all of them can vote in french elections . 
  they also have a caledonian citizenship , which mean they can elect member of the congress of new caledonia . 
  the mep from new caledonia also represent people from [ french polynesia and wallis-et-futuna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_territories_of_france_\\ ( european_parliament_constituency \\ ) ) . 
  it 's corrected , thanks , 
  ah okay , i understand your point now . 
  you are not wrong , it 's a bit tricky \\ ^ \\ ^ . 
  they are not european territories but they still are an entire part of france , and when someone ask about french geography and culture it 's hard to exclude overseas departments . 
  like i said it 's 2 millions people and those territories have a huge impact on what france is today and how france will evolve in the future , it 's a bit unfair to not talk about them when we talk about french culture . 
  guadeloupe , martinique , guyane , reunion and mayotte are definitely part of france . 
  they have the same political status as any metropolitan department and there is no complex relations between mainland france and those five territories . 
  we are not even talking about some desert territories with a special administration and status , we are talking about more than 2 millions people who are full-french citizen and benefit from the same right and obey the same laws than french people do on the european continent . 
  saint-barthelemy , saint-martin , wallis & futuna , saint-pierre-et-miquelon and french polynesia are french collectivities with special administration and more autonomy than french department but they are still part of the french republic ~ ~ ( the country ) ~ ~ ( the state ) . 
  their status may evolve so they become a french region ( like mayotte did in 2011 ) or to gain more independence . 
  nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie has an even more special status and more autonomy and it may gain its independence in the future , but right now it 's still a territory part of the french republic . 
  very hard to say . 
  geographically i 'm going to say that usa is more diverse .
