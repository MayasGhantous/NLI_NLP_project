that was a joke ... ` looking for puppies in a poppy field ' , that 's a funny sentence ... no ? 
  should have been clearer : /, 
  misleading title . 
  i read `` puppies '' , got confused looking for puppies in a poppy field . 
  very pretty picture nonetheless , and nice initiative imo  i like the idea of poetically reminding people of war casualties and sacrifices . 
   waving their weapons around . 
  what are you talking about exactly ? 
  she 's the wife of a general . 
  her breasts are considered military secret . 
  i agree ... it 's not because there are problems with the daesh that ireland has to stop caring about the israeli conflict . 
  and i find u/citizen _ coping way of thinking quite skewed : he obviously equates number of bombs dropped with engagement in a region , which is blatantly false imo . 
  i think that was a joke pointing out the fact that the headline was ambiguous . 
  what ? 
  there should be a filter to keep titles containing `` reportedly '' from reaching the first page ... 
  i do n't get your point : s, 
  but then you have to put buildings near a nuclear plant : s and i do n't know if it 's warm enough . 
  it 's not the rivers that are overheated , but the part of them where the warm water connects with the main stream . 
  but that is still an issue , of course . 
  ... you need a river , not a sea . 
  i have yet to hear about tsunamis in a river 100km away from the sea . 
  the only nuclear scientist i spoke to about fukushima told me it actually pointed out how * sturdy * and * safe * a nuclear facility is . 
  you need a freaking tsunami to breach its wall , and it did n't even make it explode . 
  useless to say , in most european countries tsunamis are n't an issue : just put the plant away from water . 
  the other thing she told me was that the real problem today is that nuclear plants are n't taken care of enough ( it 's expensive ) , so that old ones begin to show their age . 
  and that is , according to her , the real danger . 
  so , we do n't really have anything to learn from fukushima ( do n't build your nuclear plant in a prone-to-destruction-by-billions-of-cubic-meters-of-liquid-death area ? 
  ) , but should take care of our own issues , ie dilapidation . 
  i 'm note talking about the problem of nuclear waste , i do n't know much about it . 
  i would have said alsace , but you make good points about vend\u00e9e ... but as you said : we 're not that zealous in france anyway . 
   as much as it says `` 1980s '' . 
  that 's true : s, 
  well , does n't mean he ca n't say he find them shitty . 
  with a quick survey around me ( ~ 20 ppl ) i found that around 90 % of my entourage had the same opinion . 
  it 's not because you are a `` most important graphic design studio '' that ppl need 3 degrees in art studies or whatever to be allowed to say that the bank notes you designed are ugly . 
  they were n't tasked to do piece of arts that only connoisseurs would have to look at . 
  notes are used by an entire nation , and as such if the majority of it thinks it 's ugly and you should have done otherwise , well , imo you failed . 
  does n't mean it 's not artistic or does n't have any value , though . 
   i would like to remind [ the comments ' ] authors that the republic of bulgaria is a member of the eu and nato and it does not owe explanations about its sovereign decisions to third parties . 
  i love this sentence . 
  `` fuck you , russia . '', 
  the pixel side of the notes is ... ugly . 
  ( imo , of course ) the other side is quite pretty . 
  man , i could n't be a hardcore christian , too many of my friends are lesbian : /, 
  okay , thanks , 
  i did n't say that whole christ . 
  was okay with gays , just that whole christ . 
  was n't against them ... 
  idk , i 've heard lots of christian friends tell me that the testaments actually says nothing ` bout homosexuality . 
  i did n't read the books , though . 
   whole christianity is openly against gays wrong , actually , not all christians are against gays ... 
  story : http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/german-graffiti-legend-oz-killed-by-train-116274, 
  yeah , that 's what i meant , actually : s, 
  the troll is a lil ' bit obvious , mate ;-), 
   who said anything about going back ? 
  if you do n't buy a return , people will get suspicious . 
  then you realized your watch was 2 minutes ahead of time . 
  it 's not a matter of knowing anything . 
  just that people saying things like `` xxx are all yyy '' tend to have pretty low insight on things . 
  yeah , sure , i 'm the one making assumptions here . 
  proof that socialism in france is n't actually socialism . 
  at least they did n't give our alsace and lorraine to germany . 
   no , he was n't . 
  i 'm pretty sure he was . 
  and it 's pretty funny to say `` fuck romanians , they 're so xenophobic ! '' y' know , since it 's a xenophobic comment and everything ... 
  in france we have several of them ^ ^, 
  i was being ironic \\ ^ \\ ^ \u00b0, 
  i like how the colour represents the absolute number of people and not a percentage of the country 's population . 
   believing in god and not practicing is a contradiction . 
  that is so wrong . 
  please realize that believing in god is not equal to practicing one of the very few religions you know anything about . 
  you can read the [ deism article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deism ) on wp to learn something . 
  ^ the ^ judgment ^ of ^ paris . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judgment_of_paris_ ( wine ) edit : links with brackets are a pain . 
  well , we do have the best wines in the world . 
  ^ please ^ do n't ^ mention ^ 1976 . 
  no , no , that 's not what i was trying to say . 
  i get that , of course . 
  i feel that they use this idea of banning social benefices abusers ( and i agree that we should do something about that , not necessarily banning them , but something ) as a lure to get us not to think about the real issues . 
  they 'll save maybe a couple hundred millions $ , and they get to continue doing nothing about what they do n't want to do anything about , namely here tax evasion ( hey , after all , i 'm pretty sure election campaigns are paid in part thanks to tax evasion ) . 
  and , of course , i 'm not even mentioning the stinking * look-at-all-those-thieving-foreigners-coming-to-gemrnay-to-steal-our-hard-earned-money-and-abuse-our-social-system * undertone . 
  i might be wrong , of course ( i hope so ) , but you know what they say : when in deep shit , point a scapegoat . 
  yeah , but here ` easier to handle ' means ' a pretext not to do anything about the other issues ' . 
  that 's what is bothering me . 
  you hear about the absurdly high cost of tax evasion , politicians promise to do something about it ... and then nothing . 
  they could solve this problem a hundred times and it would n't save as much money than fixing tax evasion , so even if it is more difficult , it 's still worth it . 
   well if you agree with abusing the social benefices system i never said that . 
  it 's just that they are far more pressing points . 
  yeah , sure , but at one point you have to tackle the main issue . 
  here , they just do n't have the balls to fix the real leak , so instead they pass their nerve on people who ca n't retaliate . 
  while companies steal [ billions and billions of euros ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/401801/tax-evasion-costs-european-union-one-trillion-euros-a-year ) via tax evasion every year , germany decides to pick on the poor souls that abuse social benefices systems , maybe costing europe a few hundred millions at most . 
  way to go , germany !, 
  `` qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons '' are you sure ? 
  i 'm sorry if my pussiness is bothering you , jackass - __ -, 
  not the tea-flavoured fart !, 
  you inbred bastard x ), 
  i just ... dislike the marseillaise very much . 
  it 's a war song , absurdly violent . 
  of course , there is a reason , but i feel it does n't belong to this world anymore . 
  we should turn the page . 
  wish for peace , not to bathe in the blood of our enemies .
