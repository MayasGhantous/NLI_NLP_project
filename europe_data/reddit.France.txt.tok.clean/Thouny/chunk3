  yeah , also the fact that those languages are closer to english than french is can help . 
  nope . 
  the word is in * italics * , which means that it 's a foreign word , not a french one . 
  he therefore follows the rules of its language , here english . 
  arabic is n't really a language . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a sub-language or some shit like that ; but classical arabic is spoken by few people , who tend to use local dialects/derivative of this language . 
  so , when you learn `` arabic '' , you have to pay attention to what you 're really learning . 
  hahahaha !, 
  look at this idiot !, 
  it 's ** french ** with a capital `` f '' , you moron !, 
  hahahaha !, 
  like this ? 
  he is definitely not a language nazi . 
  you should come to / r/france and try sprinkling a correct french sentence with english words . 
  you 'll get to see the actual language nazi then . 
  * well well bladiou-blada . 
  you forgot the ` stache , comrade !, 
  if you do n't understand the difference between talking and thinking , it says a lot about you . 
  you talk in your name , by using `` people '' . 
  okay , sure , whatever , just resume what you were doing . 
   almost destroyed this subreddit ahum . 
  i do n't think so . 
   these comments only make your side look like morons , making it hard for people to side with you . 
  please stop talking for other people . 
  talk in your name , that 's plenty enough thank you . 
  i do not wish for you to act as my spokesperson . 
   he was happy about being able to film everything . 
  no , he was in shock . 
  laughing is perfectly normal under those circumstances . 
   the person filming is partially laughing even . 
  this is a perfectly normal reaction after a shock . 
  this is neither poor taste nor ridiculous . 
  adrenaline does strange things to your brain . 
   and a chocolatine ooh , boy , what have you done ... 
  sounds legit . 
  i 'm readying my crossbow at the moment . 
  let 's see if those longbows still deserve their reputation . 
   and freedom of thought no . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  you 're not forbidden from thinking anything . 
  you may be forbidden from expressing something , but it has nothing to do with freedom of thought . 
   also , in holland there 's a saying : `` i 'd love fance except there 's french people there . '', 
  in france we say that about literally every region in the world . 
  well , except england of course . 
  there is literally no reason to ever love this god-forsaken piece of land . 
  `` except that no , the actual earliest reference to the bidet is in a french text , describing such an item in a parisian house on the 31 ^ st of december , 1709 . '', 
   and cream yeah , i ca n't stress that part enough . 
  * carbonara with cream * . 
  yummy !, 
  i do n't care if it 's true . 
  from this day on , i 'll only accept this explanation . 
  i knew what a joule is years before i learnt what a kwh is . 
  `` yeah , you , go back there !, 
  yeah , you 'll be killed , but i promise on the long run it 'll be better . 
  '' - . - and we could welcome them while working to fix the situation there , which will allow them to go back there in safer conditions . 
  telling them `` no , go back there , and fix it '' is senseless . 
  i 'll add that 1 gwh = 3,6 tj ( 10 ^ 12 joules ) , as a watt is 1 j.s ^ -1 , and an hour is 3,6.10 ^ 3 s. 
   which , in the long term , would be better for all involved . 
  especially for those leaving war zones and stuff . 
  they 'll feel right at home in a mass grave , i 'm sure . 
  i used `` academic french '' as `` correct french according to the academy '' here . 
  oh , my bad . 
  then yeah , you 're right , 
  it is true , entirely true . 
  but you 're comparing the language any ensglish-speaking person would speak with an acad\u00e9mie-endorsed french that basically no one speaks : / and that does n't make too much sense in my opinion . 
  yeah , but then you 're comparing two things that are n't equivalent : /, 
  the word was `` * courriel * '' ( `` ** courri ** er ** \u00e9l ** ectronique '' ) . 
  that a bad example :p the word is n't bad , easier imo to say than `` e-mail '' , and some ( few ) people actually use it . 
  but , yeah , sometimes it 's a taaad ridiculous . 
   from what i 've heard , french for example is much slower to adopt new words . 
  yes and no . 
  spoken , casual language does just exactly that . 
  but academic french does n't , and needs to be accepted/decide by the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise . 
  ( i 'm talking about france 's french ; for the other french-speaking countries , i do n't know how it works ) . 
  as we all did , as we all did ... 
  and in french , someone slightly drunk ( tipsy ) is `` gris '' ( grey ) . 
  and there is more : `` so\u00fbl '' ( the formal word for `` drunk '' ) initially meant `` full '' ( generally of food , iirc ) , hence the expression `` tout son so\u00fbl '' , `` until fullness , satiation '' ( manger tout son so\u00fbl --  to fill up to your back teeth ) .

  you wan na talk about * mediterranean * weather ? 
  you ? 
  you do n't know what * mediterranean * really means . 
  you liked it , you chose it , you merely * adopted * it . 
  but it comes from the mediterranean see . 
  i was * born * in it , * molded * by it . 
  i could see mediterranean , i could smell mediterranean , i could eat mediterranean , i could * live * mediterranean since the day i was born . 
  a glance through my window would show me the mediterranean see , mother of all mediterranean climates . 
  can you say the same ? 
   some marseille weather do you mean [ this ] ( http://pastis.petanque.free.fr/images/pastis2.gif ) ? 
   the best climate ( mediterranean ) we may have a disagreement here buddy . 
   essentially you are guilty until you prove your innocence . 
  yeah , that 's what i was going to say : / thanks, 
   as it currently stands , it 's already illegal for britons to refuse to surrender their passwords or encryption keys just a question , maybe some people people will be able to answer me : would it be illegal to change your encryption key to one you do n't know ? 
  e.g. , i know they will take my hd , and i absolutely do n't wa n't them to read what 's inside . 
  so , i change the `` password '' , mash my keyboard on the notepad , copy-paste it ( to `` confirm '' it ) , then delete it from the notepad . 
  then i shut off my device . 
  what would happen ? 
  how * dare * you not to know something !,
