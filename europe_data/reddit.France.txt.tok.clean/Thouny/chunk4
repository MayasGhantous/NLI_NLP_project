  it 's * outrageous * !, 
  feel the wrath of my downvote you filthy non-omniscient person !, 
   diantre !, 
  interj . 
  ( vieilli ) interjection marquant la surprise , l\u2019admiration . 
  diantre !, 
  from the `` multidictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise '' so , ftfy :  * diantre !, 
   i agree that the french model is unsustainable it could have been , if the taxi licenses were n't resellable : /, 
   but i do n't think it would be good if everyone was doing it . 
  or even one person , for that matter . 
  yeah but then he might have had troubles . 
  you 're not supposed to shoot tourists :p, 
  but at least children do n't hold the fate of a whole country in their hands : /, 
   people in europe should n't act differently because of the refugees , including syrians , but the syrians are who should respect the customs and traditions of others . 
  but on the other hand , those people are refugees , they 're probably in a dire situation , and if simple measures can improve their state of mind by making them a bit more comfortable , i 'm okay with it . 
  i 'm not saying we should recreate a mini-syria near every refugees camp , but asking everyone to mind them ( not forcing them to do anything , just `` please consider that there are syrian refugees nearby , if you do n't mind we think it would be a good idea for everyone to avoid wearing revealing clothes , etc. '' ) . 
  no law , no rule , just a favor asked to the population . 
  i think it could reduce the risk of backlash ( `` those migrants who want to force their culture on us '' ) since you 're asking , not ordering anything , and maybe help those refugees , if only by a modicum . 
  no , not really , thank you very much . 
  ^ ^ yeah , ^ ^ the ^ ^ last ^ ^ part ^ ^ is ^ ^ in ^ ^ german , ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ speak ^ ^ dutch ^ ^ at ^ ^ all ^ ^ and ^ ^ hope ^ ^ nobody ^ ^ will ^ ^ notice ^ ^ : s, 
  last time on the radio i caught someone saying that greek people were actually stealing money from the german pockets , and should have been thrown out of the eu a long time ago . 
  but please note that i did n't get if the guy was invited by the radio to talk , or if he was a listener who called to express his opinion . 
  good question ; i have no idea how you could say that with any confidence . 
  but ... do you * have to * have your wedding in a church ? 
  ok , but , ca n't you just get a civil marriage ? 
  this way , churches do n't have to give gay weddings . 
  there is no civil marriage in denmark/poland ? 
  \u0391\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 --  truth , is n't it ? 
  so `` really '' ? 
  \u0395\u03b3\u03c9 \u03bf\u03c7\u03b9 --  no idea ... : s `` ego '' means `` i , me '' , but in latin , no in greek ... arf : /, 
  i re-read / u/tomshoe 's comment , and at no point did he disagree with this . 
  he did n't even talk about the subject ... 
   but you need to compare the early expansion . 
  why ? 
  because it suits your point ? 
  amen . 
   unfortunately for everyone , his prophet was n't good and muslims need to choose fast . 
  er ... what ? 
  i know muslims who are also good people . 
  they do n't have to chose either , they can be both . 
  or did i misunderstand your comment ? 
  no need to be rude , pal . 
   \\ #grexit recorded/noted : 18-members eurogroup ( without greece ) to prepare the exit . 
  please note that i am not quite sure of how to translate `` act\u00e9 '' . 
  `` acter '' is a procedure/diplomacy verb meaning `` to officially record/note '' . 
  no , i 'm saying it 's tautological . 
  you cheaters \u2256 _ \u2256, 
  dclauzel only do it with english ( for obvious reasons ) and his native language . 
   we should just all speak french here and close the debate :p finally someone who has some common sense !, 
   word that exist in english , but is not used very often and , most importantly , does n't have the same meaning \\ ^ \\ ^ \u00b0, 
   your comment is on that thread , you probably remembered this that 's just plain stupid , mate , stop . 
  my comment is on a completely different topic ( * assurance matters * , for fuck 's sake ) , and anyway , i 'm sorry to disappoint you , but i do n't remember every comment in every thread i participate in . 
  i know , shocking . 
   the mod pretended i was only commenting about this which i did n't well , i trust my_baby_ate_dingo ; he went through your contributions on / r/france , and found almost no comment on any other topic . 
   and also explicetely told me to stop talking about the religion all together on r/france . 
  he asked you to either also talk about other topics ; or not comment * as often * on / r/france . 
  here :  soit tu participes \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 sur d'autres sujets et tu nous montres que tu peux parler d'autre chose , soit tu r\u00e9duis fortement ton influx de messages ici  you either participate to the sub on other topics and show us that you can speak about other things ; or you strongly cut down on your number of posts here . 
  so , not the same thing , huh ? 
   is u/alaluo banned , when he posts topics quite frequently on so called `` islamophobia '' ? 
  but he participates in other ways , 
  yeah , my honor is safe x ), 
  yeah !, 
  and you know what the worst thing is ? 
  by spending so much time posting on / r/europe , i did n't get yesterday 's poc prize on / r/bestoffrance !, 
  if you feel the need to exaggerate to this extent to make your point , then i guess you know pretty well your complaint is just silly , do n't you ? 
  that 's actually very understandable x ), 
  you were banned , as it is explained , because you just would n't shut up about how islam is the worst thing ever . 
   all your comments on / r/france have islam as their only topic . 
  i just went through your 8 months of contributions , and i only found 3 or 4 exceptions top . 
  the mod offered you a deal : just talk about other topics , and you 're alright . 
  i repeat : he did n't ask you to * stop talking about islam * . 
  just to * talk about other things , too * . 
   surprise , you 're right on top , looks like you knew about this . 
  my comment has nothing to do with this . 
  but are you trying to say ? 
  that i 'm a spy for the mods ? 
  a double-agent ? 
  good thing dclauzel is n't doing it like you just did , then . 
   r/france bans people who do not like islam :d yeah , let 's make shit up and pretend it 's an argument !, 
  great !, 
  muslim have `` higher numbers of radicals and people wishing to live under sharia law '' than `` other groups '' ? 
  yeah , i 'd guess that much : /, 
  well , there would n't be much to censor anyway :d, 
  it was n't censored : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b86ws/mods_of_reurope_stop_sweeping_islamist_violence/csjufbw, 
   we do have much higher numbers of radicals and those that wish to live under sharia law . 
  higher than what ? 
  yeah ... talk about petty shit . 
  and there is one guy [ who apparently holds dclauzel as the sole cause of his disliking french ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b6prz/the_megathread_is_a_fucking_mess/csjmq7e ) . 
  note that he 's talking about * posters * , not * subscribers * , though , so the numbers could work differently . 
  actually , i have never heard * false friend * . 
  it may be a literal translation of * faux ami * in french . 
  false cognate does ring a bell , on the other hand . 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_friend well , apparently , it exists . 
  false cognate is a different thing ( similar words in different languages , similar meaning , but different root ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_cognate, 
   things like linking a google-translated news article in a sticky , sure it 's local , but it 's a headache compared to a well-maintained english source i agree with that part , really , but it 's a different matter . 
  that 's what buggers me most in this discussion : there is an issue to be addressed ( the title was ... awkward , and yeah , i agree , a google-trans of a french article is n't the best source ) . 
  but suddenly it was only about how dclauzel is basically the bastard child of de gaulle and napoleon because he writes in english * and * french . 
  you misunderstood my point . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , you may write in as many languages as you wish . 
  the thing is , it takes some time to translate it correctly ( so that it is understandable ) .
