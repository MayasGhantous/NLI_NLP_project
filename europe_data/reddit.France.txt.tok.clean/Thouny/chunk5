  if you want to write in 6 languages , well , i 'm sure you 'll give up soon . 
  which is why i think the `` then everyone should write in as many languages as they can ! '' argument is n't valid . 
  most people would limit themselves to 1 , 2 or maybe 3 , because any more would take too long . 
  and 3 languages sounds okay to me . 
   we 're not talking about every language you speak , only two . 
  you 're right , i was n't clear at all . 
  i 've read some people say `` dclauzel should n't write in french and in english , because if you 're gon na write in anything else that english , you should write in * every other * language , and it would be silly '' , which is a bullshit argument . 
  i should n't have brought it up with you . 
  * good wind then !, 
  to the reseeing !, 
  do they write in turkish then translate it in english ? 
  blablabla -- blablabla blablabla -- blablabla ( you can also click on `` source '' under a post to see how it 's written ), 
  \u00c7a marche  * it walks  *, 
  not bad for a toaster , though . 
   ah , but the french are too special to behave like everyone else , right ? 
  reread all my comments , mate : i would be happy if other , non-french people were to do it . 
  i enjoy multiculturalism , and i enjoy seeing several languages reflecting europe 's diversity in this thread . 
  this has nothing to do with the french language . 
  yes , i think so too t.t, 
   \u0395\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u03b9 what are the last two characters ? 
  no , he 's a mod , there are no honest mistake . 
  i personally think he tried to type `` heil hitler '' , but the autocorrect changed it to `` attentat '' ^ / s, 
  you forgot the english translation , though . 
  he 's a mod , so you can . 
  mods and ellen pao , it 's alright , you can insult them . 
  what language is this ? 
  portuguese ? 
   if every user were to post each comment in every language they speak 1 . 
  not everyone would do it anyway , and especially for longer posts ; 2 . 
  we 're not talking about * every * language you speak , only two . 
   are we going to suggest that people should be learning french just because claude here ca n't keep his raging language boner to himself ? 
  man , he 's writing in english . 
  you do n't have to learn french , just read the text in english . 
  why is it so hard for you to understand ? 
  surrendering already ? 
  it 's a word that looks like one you know , but does n't have the same meaning . 
  famous example in french : * eventually * means `` in the end '' , but it looks like the french word * \u00e9ventuellement * , which means `` possibly '' --  lot of french people will use `` eventually '' as though it meant `` possibly '' . 
  err ... i do n't remember to be honest : s at the very least two hours a week , probably more , but it 's a bit old for me \\ ^ \\ ^ \u00b0, 
  i understand that . 
  o.o no , it 's not right at all . 
  we begin to learn a first `` lv '' ( langue vivante , `` living language '' , as opposed to `` dead languages '' such as latin or greek ) , usually english , german or spanish , at ( gen. ) at age 11 ; then 2 years later , we begin a second one . 
  my main problem was the teachers : in my 9 years learning german , i 've only had 1 good teacher ... but it is changing right now ; i think now we start learning a second language at 12 and not 13 . 
   i mean honestly , there are so many unfriendly people in france when you do n't speak french : / i guess it 's because there are so many people who do n't speak anything other than french : / ^ ( and some of them may even not actually speak french ), 
  yeah but at the same time , there are no brits in switzerland :p, 
  d : you meanie !, 
  i was n't talking about you here , but referring to the general atmosphere of this whole thread . 
   dclauzel managed to make me cringe every time i see something written in this language honestly ... i 'm feeling quite tired of this . 
  this is silly . 
  i guess you 're not 12yo anymore . 
  grow up . 
  if dclauzel alone managed to make you feel that way , then reddit has a far too great influence on your life . 
  go outside , breathe , do something . 
   i come to this sub explicitly looking for bilingual comments please tell it louder , some people need to hear it : /, 
  ouh , the german are waking up !, 
  merkelreich is * en route * !, 
   he knows it , there is a difference between `` hey dude , would you mind ... '' and `` this mod is a fucking idiot !, 
  fuck french with their language and shit ! '' , though . 
  but this book is soooo cute !, 
  i formally apologize on the behalf on my language , / u/violetjoker . 
  we did not intend for things to go like this . 
  you were the chosen one !, 
  but please at least tell us what language it is x ), 
  happy cake-day , btw , 
  he has n't answered anything regarding his choice of word because that would just lead to more insult , i guess . 
  the atmosphere is n't actually chilled right now . 
   this is n't the first time his obnoxious behavior has been noticed and commented on . 
  yeah , but everytime i see such a `` comment '' , it 's a direct insult . 
  and usually , there are some people who like it , some people who dislike it , and then most people seem to just plainly do n't care at all . 
   in a bilingual way english and greek but please do !, 
  i agree that this could be an alternative , 
  couci-cou\u00e7a . 
  this is not a french title , but a badly ( i concede that much ) written english one . 
  `` in '' is n't french . 
   if he genuinely thought that attentat was modern english , he 'd have said so . 
  i do n't get it . 
  would he have written  attentat ^ ( \u00a1 \u00a1 modern english !! ), 
  i think that if people were to cordially ask him to put english first , then french ( or whatever language ) , he would be open to the the discussion . 
  but here , he was insulted from the get-go , which instantly turns any discussion into an argument . 
  wow , interesting !, 
  thanks a [ bunch ] ( http://spring-blossoms.com/india_products/mixed_blooms_hand_bunch_big.jpg ) , 
  oh poor cabbage !, 
  see ? 
  not difficult :p but i think the correct translation would just be `` oh , dear '' or `` oh , poor dear '' ... oh , no : `` oh , poor little you ... '', 
   because if he wanted to say it in french , he would have say `` m\u00e9ga fil '' . 
  and he would have used `` \u00e0 '' and not `` in '' , 
   fuck you and eat shit english nationalists !, 
  please do n't add fuel to the lava pit t.t, 
   be assured that the ones who speak in english are sick of putting up with you . 
  i do n't know , from this thread i see that not everyone is . 
  and the loudest are n't necessarily the most numerous . 
   we accomodate and show respect , and you turn around and spit on it . 
  no we do n't :(, 
  x ) new frenchblock extension available for google chrome , only $ 1.99 !, 
  c'mon , gim me some you darn bastard !, 
   \u0393 alone sounds like w in why o.o oh , this must be a difference between ancient greek and modern , is n't it ? 
  thanks , 
   merde , imagine someone from germany visiting your country and blurting all his phrases out in german , only to translate them after . 
  this is not the same situation * at all * . 
  this is a written medium ; you do n't have to wait for someone to have finished speaking in one language and switch to the second . 
  it only slow down reading by a fraction of second ( * oh , this part is in xxx , i can skip it * ) , whereas orally , it takes twice as long ( since you have to say everything twice ) .
