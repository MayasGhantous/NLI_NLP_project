  you can always count on a ` strayan to be kind , 
  i love your translation x ), 
  this is a fair point . 
  but this would only be true for rather big post ; if it takes 10 lines instead of 5 , it does n't matter ( but 30 instead of 15 , yeah , maybe ) . 
  but maybe if you first write in english only , and then offer the translation after a line ... like this : the italics does kind of convey that this is n't `` actual text '' , and once you know that this kind of post is actually half as long as they appear , you 're not as put off as you could be , i think . 
  * d-d-d-d-drop the baguette * the sound would n't be that impressive , though :(, 
   do not pretend this is not the case at least with the french . 
  yet i will . 
  this is not the case . 
  be assured that everyone who is posting in both languages would be extremely happy if people from other countries were to do the same thing . 
   it hurts the flow of reading i think that if you write in two separate paragraph , it does n't change anything .

  do you agree ? 
  ( of course , the problem here is that it is in the middle of a whole comment ... i 'm talking about cutting the comment in two parts , top in english , bottom in whatever language damn well pleases you ) . 
  as for the arrogant vibe , i 'd say that being angry about bilingual posting is showing a saddening lack of curiosity :( i really enjoy the vast variety of languages in europe , and i think it 's be great if this sub were to showcase it . 
  * doxa to theo gia tous kartes tes gkoukl * so google is * \u0393\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb * in greek ? 
  funny , i would have bet on * \u0393\u03bf\u03bf\u03b3\u019b * ^ ( i 'm sorry , i could n't find the proper * lambda * : / ) . 
  why two words ? 
   other nations learn a lot of obsolete english words it seems . 
  i do n't think he learnt it . 
  either he found it in a dictionary ( maybe an old one ? 
  ) , or he read it somewhere , and as it is the same word as in french , it stuck . 
  no , it 's a mix of french and english x ) dclauzel is french ( and the `` \u00e9 '' in `` m\u00e9gathread '' is a dead giveaway ) . 
  he got confused between his two languages , that can happens : / the real issue is that it happened for an important stickied post . 
  yeah , but in english it is apparently obsolete ? 
   a ok lets write every comment in all the european languages !, 
  i would n't see the problem , actually , if everyone were to write in his own language then in english ( or the other way around , i do n't care ) . 
  i 'd actually really like it . 
   the thing is that is very annoying to read a comment in two languages !, 
  no ... no , it 's not . 
  i mean , not for me , i ca n't say for you of course . 
   english is the international language today.get over it !!!, 
  yes , he is writing in english . 
  but also in french . 
  i really do n't see the issue . 
  yes , i am serious . 
  i find your suspicion pretty silly , really , but that may stem from the fact that i know him better than you do , that 's really not his style , i assure you . 
  well , not completely . 
  someone is n't happy about what dclauzel has done regarding the coverage of this attack ( the megathread is , according to him , a mess ) . 
  maybe dclauzel should n't have done that . 
  maybe he should have done differently . 
  that is a matter we can discuss , that is interesting . 
  but , yeah , just insulting the mod , and then going amok about french people who want to take over the sub with their filthy language , that 's petty bullshit : /, 
  no , the title is not in french : the `` in '' does n't mean anything in this context . 
  i agree that the title is n't in proper english , and this is a problem ( because it should ) ; but let 's not make a mountain out of a molehill : dclauzel is n't pushing some kind of french agenda to overtake / r/europe . 
  he just made some mistakes here . 
  no it 's not . 
  `` in '' is n't a french word , it would be `` \u00e0 '' ; the title does n't mean anything in french . 
  i think that dclauzel just made a mistake here . 
  when you write in english a word that also exists in french , it 's easy to forget an accent ( `` \u00e9 '' --  m\u00e9gathread ) ; as for `` attentat '' , well , he probably thought it was an english word . 
  please do n't misunderstand me : i 'm not happy with the title as it is . 
  it should definitely be in proper english . 
  but let 's not go overboard and start imagining that dclauzel is trying to impose french as the only official language for / r/europe , 
   and we are in no mood to have to learn yet another language why would you need to ? 
  he writes in both english and french ... 
  and instead of politely proposing a solution , or even just discussing , i decided to insult the mod . 
  i am in germany , i earn 200 $ and pay 300 $ : /, 
   the interpreter answers , `` i 'm waiting for the verb . '', 
  this is not a joke :( it happens way too often , and when the verb finally comes , sometimes i 've forgotten the sentence t.t that , and the numbers . 
  english : 123 --  one hundred twenty three ( 1-2-3 ) french : 123 --  cent vingt-trois ( 1-2-3 ) german : 123 --  ein hundert dreiundzwanzig ( 1-3-2 ) : * why * ?!, 
  in most situation , it 's not a problem , but i have a job where i often need to spell out numbers , or write down numbers that i 'm told , and this is brain-twister @_ @, 
  there was a post in / r/france recently about someone getting one . 
  but they 're rare , from what i know . 
   i 'm no fan of card payment you 're german . 
  of course you 're not . 
  in his defense , i think a significant number of them are possessed by the devil , because no matter what you do , you wo n't make it work , unless you call for the it guy , in which case the bloody thing will suddenly starts working properly when the guy opens the door . 
  yeah , but in france you get a hadopi letter politely asking you to stop . 
  not a $ 1,000 fine . 
  i ca n't believe those assholes who just ride their bike on this sanctuary . 
  someone should do something about it . 
  he 's dutch . 
  do n't be too hard on him . 
  thanks , 
   taxis are incredibly expensive no , the places where taxis are the most expensive are loz\u00e8re and corsica . 
  in paris , they are n't that expensive . 
  but i 've heard that they do try to sneak in a few detours : /, 
   what they said is very true , it 's exactly what i do when i have an appointment . 
  it 's what i do , too , but then i get lost on the way and end up arriving 15 minutes late : s, 
   the weather up there can change in a matter of minuets . 
  whereas in the rest of the uk , it just rains continuously . 
  it looks the the severed head of an angry owl . 
  what is it ? 
  in paris i had an american ^ ( i 'm being unfair , it was a child , so it was cute , but i wanted to bash on the americans like the cool kids do ) ask me if you could see the statue of liberty from the top of the eiffel tower . 
  oh , do n't take it the wrong way : we are . 
  we are just not telling you why . 
  [ god do i love this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yy23dbytek ) . 
  thanks . 
  i put all of my soul into it . 
  but . 
  not . 
  for . 
  wine .

  haha , look who 's speaking . 
  go back to your hamburger , you pick-up humping , gun-sucking redneck . 
   i hate the bottles made from floppy plastic , the rigid ones are so much nicer . 
  i 've read a freaking scientific paper giving credit to this theory of the hardness of the bottle influencing perceived taste . 
   in paris we consider that crossing lights are a suggestion . 
  to be more precise , you look at them to know if the car that prevented you from crossing is either an * asshole * ( red ampelm\u00e4nnchen ) , or a * fucking asshole * ( green ampelm\u00e4nnchen ) . 
  but you sure do n't pay them any attention * before * trying to cross .
