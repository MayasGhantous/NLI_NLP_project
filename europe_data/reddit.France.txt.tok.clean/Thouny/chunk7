  that 's useless , and you may miss the 1/8th second gap between two cars that would have let you cross . 
   this would emotionally break almost any irish person . 
  especially if they 're from cork . 
  i come from paris . 
  this rule is like `` how not to ever ever ever be able to cross a parisian street ever '' . 
  but i adapted \\ ^ \\ ^ \u00b0, 
   i 've discovered some great ways to use artichokes where you would n't expect them . 
  i 'm ... not sure i want to know more , actually : s, 
  except at some chinese weddings , apparently . 
  you 're so susceptible when someone corrige ton fran\u00e7ais imbuvable !, 
  ^ ( yes , it is only a joke , do n't worry :p ), 
  no , he should stop writing in french to improve his english !, 
   * i could be worse though : what you you say about an english-ridden europe ? 
  if you really want to write in english , go for it , but at least make some effort . 
  but right now , it 's just unbearable . 
  i 'm not saying it to me la p\u00e9ter . 
  the underdogs of humor ? 
  you sure have n't talked to a lot of germans . 
  i think he was just correcting your assertion , 
  it 's for crime and misdemeanor worthy of prison only . 
  i do n't think stealing is worthy of prison . 
   you can see that it has nothing to do with a heart attack , that guy clearly was either drunk or too dumb to drive wow , you have pretty good eyes to be able to make that out from the video . 
  with my friends , we usually go for the `` it 's four , not three , you fucking barbarian ! '' , but that 's because we like each other . 
   and was going for the kiss in the us or the uk well , they 're usually far more uncomfortable than you are , so it 's not * that * bad . 
  it 's kind of funny , even . 
  yes we are , 
   ~ ~ france ~ ~ paris - every tourist attraction is surrounded by a bazaar , about half of which empties at a sprinting pace at the sight of a policeman . 
  ftfy, 
   well the french are n't actually all awful . 
  just the ones in and around paris are . 
  finally someones gets it !, 
  no , you forgot the `` to '' after `` went '' ... 
   switzerland is made up entirely of roundabouts in my experience . 
  you 've never been to france , probably :d i 've read recently that we have like half of the world 's roundabouts . 
  germany seems not to know that in the 21 ^ st century , it is normal to pay with a special type of card issued by your bank :3, 
  * density of paris : ~ 21 200 people/km ^ 2 * density of france as a whole : ~ 100 people/km ^ 2 damn o.o, 
  yeah ... work on your german a bit more and come back later :p, 
  yeah , that 's something that very often is n't mentioned , but a lot of job offers are actually bullshit offers the enterprises do n't even want filled . 
   they need people to cut down trees and do forestry work well , most country do :'), 
   it improves the statistics , and it seems like we have low unemployment rates . 
  do n't worry , they do the same in the uk ( 0-hourwork contract , what a fucking joke ) ... better to have people with the crappiest job ever that does n't even allow them to live than admitting we have an unemployment problem !, 
  australia is not a continent ... oceania is . 
  are you implying he 's a cunt ? 
  thanks , 
  yeah , of course , i said it was tricky , not impossible , 
  ... well , considering it was just after they 'd told me that * arum maculatum * was called `` schokoladeplantz '' and had me chew on a leaf ( `` it tastes of chocolate ! '' ) , it 's completely possible : / ^ ( disclaimer : as a defense mechanism , arum plants , or \u201e aronstab '' , stack microscopic silice beads in their leave , that cut your tongue when you try to eat it . 
  it 's benign , but it hurts for at least half an hour ... so do n't chew on it , people ! ), 
  no , no , i asked the question `` if eichh\u00f6rnchen is a squirrel , what 's an eichhorn ? 
  some kind of giant , prehistoric squirrel ? '' and i was answered that in bavaria they said eichhorn : /, 
  in german i 've learnt that there are three kinds of verbs : - weak verbs ( regular ) ; - strong verbs ( irregular , past participe ends in - en ) ; - irregular weak verbs ( irregular but pp . 
  ends in - t , and they kind of conjugate the same way ) . 
  so , in my head , they are irregular . 
  but my sentence was a joke , namely that there are so many irregular verbs in french that they 're not even called irregular anymore , they make a whole category on their own . 
  i voluntarily did n't use `` understand '' for that very reason \\ ^ - \\ ^ but , if you prefer , you can replace `` quantum physics '' with `` how to build and/or use a particle accelerator '' . 
  oh , by the way , german people : is it true that bavarian people say `` eichhorn '' ? 
  there are people who know quantum physics . 
  and yet , it is very hard . 
   oh , and french is n't better when it comes to pronunciation . 
  actually , french is easier when it comes to pronunciation . 
  if you do n't take names into account , if you read it , most of the time you know how to pronounce it . 
  whereas in english ... `` read '' can be said two different ways , `` finite '' is pronounced in a vastly different way from `` infinite '' , etc. 
  but , on the other hand , if you hear an english word , most of the time you 'll be able to write it . 
  whereas in french ... `` \u00f4 '' , `` eau '' , `` au '' , `` aux '' and `` aulx '' are pronounced exactly the same . 
  and there is no irregular verb in french . 
  only 3 ^ rd type ones :p on the whole , i 'd say that basic english is rather easy , but when you get better at it , if you want to improve it becomes significantly trickier . 
  i feel german is kind of the opposite . 
  absurdly hard in the beginning , but after that , it 's not as tricky as english can be . 
   in case of prostitution you can have a point if you mean to say that the prostitutes are all forced to work that way what they say is that prostitute who are n't forced to do it do it under cover ( like `` masseuses '' ) , so their income is already included in gdp . 
  for drug trafficking , i agree with you , i 'm just stating and explaining their argument . 
   most people are dependent on a job for their income what ? 
  you do n't make sense ... 
  yeah , but , according to the eu , to be included in gdp , a transaction needs mutual consent . 
  and , according to insee , drug trafficking and prostitution do n't have that . 
  so , they ca n't be taken into account to calculate gdp . 
  they 're not saying `` this is morally wrong , so we 're not including it . '' , they 're abiding by the eu 's laws , they just have a different interpretation . 
  when you read the article , it 's actually about consent . 
  eurostat and the sec think that those [ drug traffic and prostitution ] are commercial transaction that happen with mutual consent . 
  so , to be included in gdp , transaction require mutual consent . 
  but the insee assume that , in france , prostitutes who consent to do this job use a cover ( like masseuse or such ) , so their activity is already included in gdp . 
  prostitutes working without cover are in criminal networks , and did n't actually consent to this job . 
  as for drug trafficking , the idea is that the client is dependent , hence he does not actually consent . 
  you can agree or disagree ( i for myself find this a little ... weird ) , but it 's not just about moral . 
  that is not my point * at all * . 
  dog fighting : human organize them ( so , their responsibility , of course ) , but they do n't fight , only the dog --  it 's cruel and cowardly . 
  bull fighting : human organize them , * and * fight --  cruel , but not ( or less ) cowardly . 
  i repeat : i do n't say i agree with that reasoning . 
  i 'm only explaining / u/chipapa point of view . 
   not even so , if you consider there are healthy diets that exclude meat you should really read the comment you 're responding to . 
  reasonable hunting is a good thing for the environment . 
  as we have decimated big carnivores , game species can thrive and , in fact , overpopulate an area . 
  hunters play the role of the predator regulating the species . 
  stop having arguments !, 
  you 're on the internet , you should use sarcasm and insults , not arguments !, 
  no wonder you 're being downvoted . 
  because it 's organized by humans . 
  dog fighting : the humans just watch . 
  same with cocks . 
  the humans organize the fight , but do n't risk anything . 
  in bullfighting , the human organize the fight , but is part of it , so there is risk for him . 
  i still do n't think that 's ok , but i think that it 's what / u/chipapa meant .
