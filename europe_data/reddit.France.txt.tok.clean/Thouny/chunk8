  could someone explain what 's going on ? 
  why did she whip out the pump ? 
  at first i thought the first guy was like a commercial advertising his pump , and that they were trying to compare `` manual '' milk extraction to what this pump can do , but i guess not ... also , could someone tell me what i can do to get the same job as the guy with the blue shirt ? 
  seems awesome . 
  that was very interesting . 
  thank you very much . 
  haha , i 'm actually trying to find a job in tassie \\ ^ \\ ^ but i do n't think i 'll actually live there forever : as much as i love tassie , france is still my home : / so i 'll probably come back after a few years ( if i manage to go there in the first place , that is ) what are you planning to do in france ? 
  do you have any idea already ? 
  yep , i 've lived in tasmania for some time , 
  when you hang around on / r/australia , you ca n't help but getting used to it ... they actually never stop talking about the guy : /, 
  they save no one , they just let them die somewhere else . 
  burying one 's hand in the sand is n't a great way to solve anything , in my opinion . 
  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-09/tony-abbott-hits-out-united-nations-asylum-report/6289892 the un call what tone 's gov is doing * torture * . 
  haha , yeah , just ask aussies what they think about how their government treat refos , and wether we should do the same . 
  freaking joke . 
  chhh , chhh , it 's okay . 
  just nod and smile , everything 's gon na be alright . 
  with some luck they do n't know what we do with royals in france . 
  oooh yeah , stupeflip . 
  https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/bite so , no one knows for sure , according to wiki . 
  no , it only makes fun of the french . 
  in french we really enjoy belgian jokes as well , and this one baits the listener by promising one , but in the end , the joke is on the french , 
  last time i checked , the new rolls-royce were just ugly :( but i agree with the rest , and with the old ones . 
  what ? 
  i 've always been to school on wednesday ... what 's this retarded article ? 
  please explain , i 'm curious ... 
   marseille plays against psg tonight i 'm sure glad i left france . 
  i would n't want my car to be burned again : /, 
   funding and donations but in such a way that they do n't dictate their policy and agenda what ? 
  but wwf & co. . do have an agenda : it 's why they exist in the first place !, 
  and funding and donations ... they 're kind of like made of money , too ... 
   politics would be better if all money was banned . 
  ... and how would they , y' know . 
  live . 
  a few lines were really funny and well-thought in my opinion ( like the yoda quote , or dave vader ) , and i really liked the pictures \\ ^ \\ ^, 
   dark-matter researcher dave vader this line hit the sweet spot in my brain \\ ^ - \\ ^, 
   they 'd be buying more shit from china i beg to differ . 
  i know quite a few people who would like to buy more `` made in france '' , but actually ca n't because of financial issues . 
   because it 's incredibly difficult to fire someone and labor costs are horrendous . 
  minimum wage is 1453 $ / month and in reality it costs the employer ~ 2000 euros . 
  the other day on reddit there was the interview of a self-described rich guy who was saying that companies ( including his ) should pay people more , because the more you pay people , the more they can buy . 
   you mean apart from `` scapegoat '' being `` cabeza de turco '' , `` turk 's head '' in spain ? 
  oh , same here in france !, 
  `` bouc \u00e9missaire '' ( scapegoat , literally ) and `` t\u00eate de turc '' are close in meaning ( even though not literal synonyms ), 
   although no french writer has ever matched shakespeare . 
   never ** meet ** anyone from france we do n't do this only between friends, 
  haha , yeah , i kissed a girl a girl in germany to say goodbye , she got a bit stiff then said `` oh , yeah , french guy . '' \\ ^ \\ ^ \u00b0, 
  yeah , especially when suddenly someone appears whose gender is n't obvious , and you know you have a very awkward moment ahead of you : /, 
   just use headbutts o_o ' o-okays ... 
   but kissing random * people * ? 
  well , it depends * where * you put them ... but that 's not quite true . 
  when you `` kiss '' to say hello , your lips do n't actually touch the cheek . 
  it 's more a `` cheek against cheek '' while making a kissing sound . 
  but when you kiss once , you usually actually kiss the cheek , henceforth making it more sensual , 
  well , in northern france it 's not that unusual . 
  and they just wave the sticks . 
  no touching . 
  that would be weird . 
   if ** someone ** licked your ear you 'd probably feel uncomfortable c\u00c7pt . 
  i really dislike that  _ <, 
  gestures , not pictures , 
  `` okay , i 'll do it , but no swallowing '', 
  are you talking about their erections ? 
  curved . 
  could be worse . 
  you could be turkish . 
  europe , silly you . 
  did you miss the joke ? 
  burn a cd = put the songs on it . 
   gratitude is the sign of noble souls . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's actually from the slave and the lion ... the fox and the crow is about flattery , not gratitude . 
  no , it 's not totally anormal . 
  he has immunity * while he is in charge * , after that he 's got to pay the bill ( theoretically ) . 
  the idea i think is that otherwise , a dishonest opponent could accuse him of something to force him to go to court , and prevent him from doing his job . 
  they are criminal , and protesters as well . 
  about france , the same goes if you say wine or cheese , they 're not made in one place . 
  as for paris , at least what the tourist expect , it seems to exist only in their mind ... 
  capitalism has sure become crazy those last years ... 
  `` mouahaha , it sure feels * good * to be evil and * rich * at the * same time * ! '', 
  do n't be so sure x ), 
  `` mouhahaha , i can afford * two * cups of tea a day ! '', 
  `` compact studio apartment , easy and fast cleaning '', 
  `` with a continuous supply of fresh air '', 
  and cheaper , probably : /, 
  if i draw a picture of your mother entertaining 3 men at once , it wo n't be `` a frank discussion about prostitution in the west '' . 
  what i 'm saying is , we can have a frank and open discussion about this topic , but using offensive material up front is useless . 
  in my opinion , i repeat . 
  you seem to have trouble grasping the concept of analogy . 
  or rather that they come from a common ancestor . 
  my family comes from an occitan region . 
  they 're french . 
  there is no discussing it . 
  yeah , they do not only speak french , but that does n't matter . 
  they 're is no separatist movement there . 
  there are laws . 
  they 're not secret , they 're available for everyone to know , and some of them deal with hate speech ; 2 . 
  if you break those laws , such as by calling for violence against a religion , you get fined , or spend time in prison ; you 're not shot to death with automatic rifles . 
  yeah , they 've been saying that for decades , it 's not like it 's anything news ... 
  funny to see how french and swiss are just so similar . 
  yeah , colonialism was n't our best time ...
