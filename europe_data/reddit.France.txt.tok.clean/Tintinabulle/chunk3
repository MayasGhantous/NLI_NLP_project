  so sad that in france , there 's only barb\u00e8s and the xvith ... 
  do exactly the same video in the xvith district , it will be completely different . 
  what the video is showing is that in the part of paris with a large black and arabic population , there 's a lot of blacks and arabs . 
  who , by the way , are often french , you ca n't tell just by looking at them . 
  here 's a real soldier !, 
  perfect mustache even during the war . 
  say what you want about north korea , but if there 's one thing they did n't do , it 's democratising decisions . 
  so you mean i would be stronger if i was alone in the wilderness , without anyone around me , rather than giving my power to my government and the society ? 
  i think i would be eaten by the wolves soon . 
   bangalter and de homem-christo were individually awarded the rank of chevalier . 
  well , they already have the helmet . 
   you really ca n't excuse the deaths of the storming of the bastille , the `` soldiers '' defending it were invalids who had suffered war wounds and were posted at the bastille for a quiet easy job . 
  and some swiss mercenaries . 
   let 's not forget the fact that the bastille was taken to loot its ammunitions store not to free the ( 3 ) prisonners . 
  it 's true . 
  but let 's not forget that before taking the bastille , the insurgents ** asked ** for the gunpowder . 
  someone shot during the talks and that 's how the fight began . 
   so to sum up a bunch of assholes butchered some cripples to steal ammunitions , most of the soldiers were taken as prisoners ( not the governor , he lost his head ) . 
  he did n't had to , otherwise it would have been planned much before . 
  however , he had a good reason to invite him . 
  may i remember that 14th of july celebrate the [ f\u00eate de la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%aate_de_la_f%c3%a9d%c3%a9ration ) ( in july 1790 , a party so no violence ) and the storming of the bastille ( in 1789 , around one hundred deaths , but in the fights ) . 
  the terror , with the massive use of the guillotine , happened latter , around 1793-1794 . 
  in theory , you may be right . 
  in practice , you 're not . 
  because the people you 'll miss are young people , workers , who generate the wealth . 
  of course , it 's not for tomorrow , you need to see in a long term , but that 's what demography do . 
  the question is : do you , as an individual , want to be significantly poorer . 
  is that opinion shared by the majority in your country ? 
   malta voted 66-1 to legalize gay marriage ? 
  what ??!??!, 
  i know , it 's a shame one mp refused to embrace progress . 
   uk terror funding report will not be published for ` national security reasons ' which nation ? 
  for france , just put the picture of a [ pain au chocolat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pain_au_chocolat ) with the label * chocolatine * . 
  you will trigger much more people than with old traitor p\u00e9tain . 
   not a fun of kebab myself , but i 'd say that turkish cuisine is in many respects better than french and italian food . 
  i 'm not sure kebab , in the french version , has a lot to do with turkish cuisine . 
  there 's an eu citizenship , but defined as being citizen of one of the eu countries . 
  so , you 're right , it would be symbolic more than practical . 
  reading the article , what 's described happens on a city-level , not on the national level . 
  and * lrem * , macron 's party , control very few cities . 
  marseilles ' mayor , for example , is jean-claude gaudin , a * republicain * . 
  globalized does n't mean equal . 
  there 's an economical and political unbalance , but it has nothing to do with colonisation , just with the fragile situation of african countries . 
  europe is in africa and africa is in europe . 
  that 's the way a globalized world works . 
   did n't he insinuate africa has problems because women have 7 or 8 kids when really women have 7 or 8 kids because africa has problems in the first place . 
  it 's a circle . 
  demography is the cause and the consequences of economy . 
  the question now is `` how can african countries get better ? '' . 
  working only on the economical side has provided some results , but nothing great . 
  so why not work on both sides at the same time ? 
  what macron said is really nothing new , you 'll find the same thing in most official development agencies . 
  just a question : for you , when did the colonisation happened ? 
  because it was n't a few decades ago . 
  what happened a few decades ago , in the 50 's and the 60 's , was the ** de ** colonisation . 
  and saying that some african countries have a out-of-control demography is not humiliation . 
  nigeria is not the worst , the country is not bad economically speaking . 
  it 's a powerhouse that suffers of corruption and inefficiency . 
  now , try niger : higher fertility , lower gdp . 
  sure , the density is low , but a good part of the country is the sahara . 
  imho , more worrying than nigeria . 
  come on !, 
  let 's undo the treaty of verdun, 
   of course this is not may = putin . 
  of course not . 
  nobody would think may is as strong or as stable as putin . 
  in france , i do n't really have that impression . 
  judges are usually a bit on the center-left in justice-related problems ( broad generalization ) , because they know , through their job , that ` harsh on crime ' does n't work . 
  but they 're not particularly left - or right - leaning on other problems ( or they keep it to themselves ) . 
  let 's people decide what they eat . 
  i 've no problem with eating horse or rabbit , but i know people who would never eat it . 
  glass half-full or half-empty . 
  it 's still a dire problem for the countries whose fertility rate does n't decrease much . 
   there are also studies that show that the birth rate might not drop off as fast as expected . 
  some are linked in the wikipedia article on population growth . 
  another worrying thing : it 's not because a lack of contraception . 
  families would like to have even more children ( yes , they 're doing surveys on the subject ) . 
  actually , it depends what he meant . 
  while for the whole country , the fertility rate is lower than 7 , it 's heterogeneous . 
  and you have regions where it 's much lower ( typically the african middle class in urban centers , middle class meaning much different things depending on the specific country ) and regions where it 's higher . 
  you know the problem with an ageing population , like in japan , where the number of retired people is high , so the ratio workers/population is low , and therefore it creates a strain on the economy because the workers have to support several people ? 
  it 's the same thing here . 
  lots of kids means you - you is the country here - have to take care of them , therefore spending money . 
  you 're already a poor country , so you 're not doing a great job ( nothing wrong with you , you just ca n't do miracles ) . 
  besides , since you spend money on raising kids , you do n't spend money on the economy . 
  therefore , when the kids grow up , they find a weak jobs market and become unemployed . 
  the kids also have their own kids , a lot of them ( because low education and low economy is correlated with high fertility rate ) and now you have a vicious circle . 
  it 's not a european thing , leaders in country like niger or burundi would love to have a fertility rate of 4 instead of almost 7 . 
  it would be a great thing for the country . 
  of course , it 's not the only problem some african countries are facing , but it 's a big one . 
  from a demographic point of view , he 's not wrong . 
  i 'm just giving one article , you can find a ton of them : http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/africas-demographic-transition  the report , africa 's demographic transition : dividend or disaster ? 
  notes that demographic change such as population growth and a reduction in the number of dependent youth , can have a deep impact on a country 's economic growth and the well-being of families . 
  the report lays out anagenda for african countries that can increase the likelihood of capturing the potential social and economic benefits from population growth to create a demographic dividend in sub-saharan africa . 
  at the same time , it poses a challenging dilemma if the right policies and actions are not implemented judiciously . 
  it could have been worse , it could have been nazi netherlands . 
  ( yes , / s ), 
  but chirac celebrated the 50 anniversary of hiroshima by making more tests in mururoa . 
  we have a wonderful sense of timing . 
  plot twist : you buy the house , go in and find a burglar in it .
