  the good thing is : they also wo n't have any reason . 
  frenchperson , if you prefer . 
   why does trump want to work with putin so badly ? 
  what does the us gain from this ? 
  a re-election in 2020 ? 
  it 's not clear what you mean by ` liberal ' . 
  depending on the country , it can mean very different things . 
  go get a dictionary and check the word `` mostly '' please . 
  it 's an estimate made from a spatial extrapolation . 
   this seems to imply that if op were french , he would be seen as an alt-right supporter for admiring martel , whilst this does n't have to be the case . 
  the only times i 've heard of charles martel in france , outside history books of course , is from racists . 
  so i would be suspicious . 
  from what i 've read , it was like `` let 's raid , and if the raids are successful several years in a row , let 's annex '' . 
  in france , he 's mostly admired by the racist and islamophobic far right ( i 'm not accusing / u/tvrtkoikraljsrbljem of anything , he 's not french ) . 
  the consensus among historians is that he did n't stopped an invasion , he stopped a plundering raid , somewhere between tours and poitiers . 
  i 'm not saying it was insignificant , but it 's not the victory that prevented europe from being muslim . 
  france did n't exist at that time , it was the gauls and not the celts and he did n't genocide them . 
   but at least he turned germany from a third world country to a superpower did he ? 
  i know it 's a idea some people have , but i do n't really see what he did that was great . 
  sure , germany was recovering from wwi , from the versailles treaty and hitler sustained industry with military investments . 
  but that 's not turning a country into a superpower . 
  as far as i know , they were printing so much reichsmark is was almost worthless . 
  requires no introduction ? 
  or you did n't find anything relevant to say ? 
   hellevig , a finnish lawyer and investment analyst , has been directing businesses in russia since 1992 . 
  his moscow-based consultancy awara has published its assessment of russian economic performance since 2014 with the title , `` ** what does not kill you makes you stronger ** . '' yeah , or disabled . 
  these romans are crazy !, 
  i meant , it 's fine to create new posts , but let 's avoid creating new scumbags , we 've had our share . 
  by ` them ' , you mean the posts or the scumbags ? 
   trump confusedly wandering around a hotel hallway in his dressing gown . 
  how could he get lost ? 
  it 's easy : down the hall and to the left . 
  the strong ego of the french, 
  it 's very empowering for kids . 
  it shows them that no matter how dumb they are , they can do whatever job they want when they grow up . 
  i would bat an eye . 
  she should be crowned as queen , not king . 
  if we had a vaccine against poverty , it should be mandatory too . 
  it 's less widespread . 
  there 's still a control of the education ministry , but it done more or less seriously , when it 's done . 
  technically , reddit is fond of writing it , not saying it . 
   i mean look at / r/atheism . 
  i do n't identify with anything that is going on there . 
  that sub is more alienating to me than most religous practices i know of . 
  please do n't put me in the same boat with these fanatics . 
  i 'm atheist and feel the same about this sub . 
  one 's beliefs have never been a good indicator of wether or not one is an jerk . 
   would killing an antivaxxer help ? 
  just let nature do its job . 
  i 'm aware of the difference . 
  my question was what were the differences in practice , not in beliefs . 
  that 's not really true . 
  an agnostic may think religious people are stupid for believing in something they ca n't know . 
  and in that regard , atheism is not really different than other religions . 
  there 's hundreds of religions . 
  atheists believe in none of them . 
  religious people believe in none of them but one . 
  who do agostics do than atheists do n't ? 
  i agree there 's a small difference in beliefs , but in actions ? 
  also a lot of people defined themselves as agnostic , but in practice it 's not different than atheist . 
   hard to believe . 
  so atheist , i guess ? 
   while countries like belgium and france have always had the christian religion . 
  it may explain why we 're atheist . 
  so there 's no problem with having a gender-neutral law for abortion then ( not even touching the transgendered men question ) . 
  if you accept same-sex marriage and have a gendered language in the law , some difficulties may appear , like is a gay couple subjected to the law since there 's not a husband et a wife . 
  an example in france : we would have the same problem with aknowledging a neutral gender , because some of our laws are worded in a way that assume two genders . 
  the law about parity in politics is for example `` same number of candidates of each gender '' , if you add a gender , you need to rewrite it . 
  try to look in copyitaly . 
  i 'm pinkish . 
  is that a legit race ? 
  why does it count children with one white parent and one non-white parent as non-white ? 
   we hate the french . 
  frenchest thing ever !, 
  it 's not as if they 're paid to be mep . 
  yeah , the government always forget that children are their parents ' property and not real humans with rights . 
  well , somehow , they were right . 
  the fourth largest ** as a percentage ** !, 
  try having friends who voted for melenchon . 
   but as he has been elevated to god status in france the citizens think he can do no wrong no , not really . 
  not really . 
  he also wants to add a part of proportional representation , so the opposition parties will have mps . 
  the rational is more than , today , the mps do n't have enough money to do their job correctly , particularly they do n't have enough to control the action of the government . 
  so , by cutting the number of deputies and keeping the same amount of money , they will be more efficient . 
  looking to buy an automatic weapon and welcoming the cops with a knife ... we ca n't know the future , but we can say this guy was n't the most inocuous guy on earth . 
   he is well spoken and articulate so ... not at all like trump . 
  he does n't have more power than any other president with a majority in the assembly . 
  one difference with the three previous presidents ( especially hollande and sarkozy , a bit less chirac ) is that he decided to stay , as a president , above the daily political struggle , since that the job of the prime minister . 
  in that aspect , he 's closer to mitterand . 
  another difference is that he created his own party so there is n't several movements inside his party . 
  he do n't have to manage them . 
  but they will appear . 
  they are allies . 
  look at nato for example . 
  however , being allies does n't mean always being on one 's side on non-military matters . 
  and just for the french readers : i typed `` 36 15 '' on google and waited for autocompletion . 
  the first proposition was `` 36 15 ulla '' . 
  i 'm waiting for the unions going on strike because he 'll make them protest during the summer holydays . 
   fun fact : the `` minitel rose '' was sort of an old version of a porn website except there was no picture on the minitel so it was only messages and raunchy ads . 
  you had pictures in ascii art .
