  i 'd even say stopping the attacks in paris would help our tourist industry . 
  the uk and ireland have industries that work absolutely fine , and if they have problems , it 's not schengen 's fault . 
  i 'm sure it would make us go bankrupt ... get real , of course we can afford to have border controls again . 
  we found hundreds of billions to save the banks and we 're still standing . 
  manning the borders would cost nothing in comparison . 
  only two have been identified publicly . 
  on french national and one syrian . 
  we 'll see where the other 5 dead and those still on the run are from . 
  let 's wait for the official reports but since one of them came through the current immigration route , it would surprise me if he were the only one . 
   it has nothing to do with people coming from syria by boats as far as i 've seen .

  do you even know what schengen is ? 
  ireland and the uk are n't a part of it and their economy is doing fine . 
  schengen is about the people only , goods would n't be affected . 
  this would have a negligible impact on the economy . 
  that would simply mean we could control people coming in and out of the country at random or everyone if we want to . 
  which is the prerogative of every sovereign country . 
  more importantly , that means if bulgaria or spain or any other member decides to give a visa to someone we suspect is a threat to national security , the visa is n't valid in france anymore . 
  as opposed to what 's happening now ? 
  the first guy to tackle the terrorist was french , he just did n't want the publicity . 
  not that it matters , all involved are heros .

  after charlie hebdo [ shotguns were fired at mosques all over france . 
  ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/01/08/01016-20150108artfig00116-serie-d-actes-anti-musulmans-au-lendemain-de-l-attentat-contre-charlie-hebdo.php ) pig heads were hanged in front of them . 
  people do n't take these attacks kindly . 
  exactly , let 's be more clever than the bush administration . 
  war is n't always as inefficient as irak and afghanistan . 
  sadam was keeping things in control however bad he was , by overthrowing him shit got out of control and now we 've got isis . 
  but if done carefully and with an actual follow up plan , like we are doing in mali right now , a war can be a necessary evil . 
  you win wars with troops on the ground . 
  i hope we let french nationals who want to fight for isis go in syria instead of forcing them to stay here . 
  and then allow volunteers to go in the army and get the fuckers there . 
  we should have something similar to the [ international brigades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_brigades ) . 
  we should have a referendum on the issue . 
  if french people want military interrvention in syria and irak , let 's go sort this shit out . 
  give the kurds a nation , reshape irak so it makes sense for the ethnicities , and stay there for as long as it takes for the locals to set up a state capable of handling their territory . 
  have the un peacekeepers help if we can get the security council to agree for that last part . 
  examples please . 
  i did . 
  at first i wanted to write : there 's also zola , proust , moli\u00e8re , lamartine , pagnol , musset , maupassant , rimbaud , la fontaine , racine , rostand , cendrars , colette , verlaine , daudet , duras , baudelaire , sartre , beauvoir , sand , malraux , yourcenar ... then i remembered people hate us enough for being pretentious , so i deleted that bit . 
  about contemporary authors i 've heard a lot of good things about bernard werber and his book `` les fourmis '' but i did n't take the time to read it . 
  i have n't read * atomised * , only * the map and the territory * and * the possibility of an island * . 
  both times i got a weird impression when i started reading , and when i finished the book i thought `` that was good , certainly was n't expecting that '' , those books really make you think . 
  i would say give a try to the map and the territory , the plot is good . 
  not a fan of candide , which is the only book i 've read from him . 
  i 'm sure someone 's going to tell me off for leaving proust out too  what 's your favourite book by voltaire ? 
  they 're probably the two authors who 's work is more about the stories rather than the style of writing . 
  great reads indeed !, 
  you 're right about count montechristo . 
   but i have no obligation to feed any migrants for something my grand-grand father may or may have not contributed to . 
  who the fuck asked you to do that except your own governement ? 
  do n't argue with me for things i never said . 
  acknowledgement is mainly for our moral dignity , does n't do much for the africans . 
  ffs , did i say we should do anything about it ? 
  i just said considering history , it 's not surprising african countries are n't running to our help . 
  we should deal with it ourselves by closing our borders . 
  was [ 1920 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_colonial_empire ) 400 years ago already ? 
  man , time flies . 
  i 'm not saying we should make any reparations or anything . 
  but acknowledging it is the very least we can do . 
  [ learn your history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_former_german_colonies ), 
  i do n't know , a good while . 
  colonisation ended less than 60 years ago , that 's not a long time . 
   we must guard europe 's external borders . 
  that means we have to trust the greeks and italians to keep immigrants out . 
  the problem is , the migrants do n't want to stay in these countries , so italy and greece do n't defend their border as much as if the implication was that they 'd stay there once they come in . 
  they can even use this to put pressure on other member state `` do this or we will flood you with immigrants '' . 
  before schengen france was able guard its borders pretty effectively . 
  i do n't see why we ca n't do it again . 
  of course some will still pass , but not millions . 
  the sensitive borders we have with our southern neighbours are naturally hard to trespass thanks to the alps and the pyrenees . 
  that does n't mean eu cooperation should n't be reinforced , it would be part of the solution too .

  anyone told you about `` unie dans la diversit\u00e9 '' ? 
   maybe it 's a new anti-immigration policy : do n't come to the uk , we take your porn and give your money to oil companies !, 
  i laughed . 
  forgot the tories tried to control what kind of porn people watch . 
  trying to pass off cutting subsidies to green energies claiming to aim at `` cleaner fossil fuel technologies '' is going to be a hard sell . 
   but merkel , who runs the show , has already said she wo n't budge on the key issue . 
  if she 's got one quality it 's that she listens to her people . 
  when german people get sick of the millions of immigrants flooding their country , she will budge . 
  it might take years , but i do n't doubt the moment when they say enough is enough will come . 
   ( in english , subtitled with translations ) . 
  why not everyone in their native tongue and then subtitles ? 
  what ? 
  no idea what you are on about . 
  can you explain ? 
  he said he would if he comes back in power . 
  i do n't entirely trust him to do it . 
  that being said if the situation gets worse marine le pen will get the keys to do it herself , i hope it does n't come to that . 
  i think schengen might not even need france to end , since the refugees do n't really come here provided their asylum request stands a 90 % chance of being rejected . 
  countries like sweden and germany already closed their border `` temporarily '' , that says something . 
  honestly i 'd like to blame african countries for poor management ; but we , europeans , have done so many shitty things there and we continue to do so that i ca n't blame them for not taking back the migrants . 
  it 's our job to handle the situation , not theirs . 
  schengen is over . 
  the migrants just need to destroy their passports and they get to stay wherever they want .
