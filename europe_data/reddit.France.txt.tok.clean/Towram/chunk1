you ca n't say people in ukraine do n't feel threatened . 
  i 'm not sure : `` let 's do like the anglo-saxon '' is an effective political argument here . 
  for the presidential election , obviously not in the second round , but we can get in the second round only candidates that do n't cumulate half voters , and sometimes that the majority of voters do n't want . 
  the president has a lot of power but if he does n't have a majority , the prime minister has more power ( cohabitation ) . 
  it happened two times and both involved chirac . 
  so if the assembly agree on a gouvernement it means majority of the deput\u00e9 have won a two round election in their circonscription , who are supposedly of equal population . 
  but actually here it 's a two way round with a little detail more , you only have to gain a fix percent of voters in order to be in the second round . 
  so supposedly the political opinions are a  b  c : 40 b  c  a : 35 c  b  a : 25 in every district so b will win the presidential election while a will win in `` triangulaire '' all the seats in the assembly . 
  so i do n't know how to answer at the question . 
  i think this is already [ pompous enough ] ( https://youtu.be/q1p6ml5b15i ), 
  it 's official , trump has now 276/270 needed, 
  now it is, 
  yeah !, 
  well , he had right and still germans said he 's jewish, 
  this is quite long , internet translation will be fair enough imho . 
  i think google try to make us feel good when using it . 
  i just tried `` why is france '' ( in english ) . 
  i found in 2nd `` the best country '', 
  wait , this is n't it in maroc that gay are [ often publicly beaten ] ( https://www.google.fr/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=maroc%20gays%20lynch%c3%a9s ) ? 
  and arrested for homosexuallity even when beaten ? 
  but true that it does n't make french 's retard less retard , but they are not so many . 
  the biggest loi travail 's strike was like 30 times more numerous . 
  because the law 's surname was `` le mariage pour tous '' ( wedding for everybody ), 
  balkans ? 
  spain is actually richer than slovenia . 
  actually , that 's because americans funds boeing massively that we 're obligated to do the same . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  it interest me . 
  i think everybody has understood . 
  why downvote him ? 
  what he said seems pretty correct accordingly what i found . 
  swiss evaluation : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lj-vmw8lg4c/tzlkelnzbni/aaaaaaaaczy/zkhzyowxe3a/s1600/swiss_eval_nwa2_appreciations.png, 
  it makes me think of germans , who are very pride of their `` energiewende '' but still using a vast majority of fossile fuels for their energy production . 
  [ coal powerplants in europe ] ( http://www.usinenouvelle.com/mediatheque/7/6/2/000367267_illustration_large.jpg ) their decision to stop nuclear even increased the part of coal ( most polluting fossile ) in their mix . 
  it 's sad that while pretending doing ecology , you 're sometimes doing the opposite . 
  depending on the wind , the direct pollution is send on us . 
  tl ; dr : nuclear not so bad and not sure it 's better for co2 emission to have an electric car in germany neither . 
   ireland  collect taxes i see a problem coming ... 
  for tv series , i highly recommand kaamelott , but it has a lot of familiar language or not very common words . 
  le bureau des l\u00e9gendes is also a good serie , i recommand it as well . 
  they 're doing their 51th state double agent job until the end , ca n't blame them . 
  grenoble here , waking up with that every day . 
  you 're kidding but there is a huge risk of a big earthquake in this area . 
  yeah , or simply the alps, 
  wow , just tell me where you 've got that bullshit . 
  our pm is born in spain , sarkozy is neither not a french name , napoleon was corsican , i 've a polish name and never faced any discrimination and the french school system , if maybe elitist , is very egalitarian . 
  independantism is nowhere near it is in spain . 
  what the fuck is bbr and where is the bs of allowing ethnic discrimination coming from ? 
  seriously answer me where these anger is coming from ? 
  actually it means the same and it 's used the same way as the french ` putain ', 
  so in france , no religious classes but the theme you mentioned in your quote will be studied in history , geography , philosophy or civic education for most of them . 
  in france it 's the best way to not be popular actually . 
  nah , criticizing france always have been in english and american newspaper an obligation . 
  we will never know anyway . 
   and before you know it you are the new france ok everybody stop this shit, 
  again , why the fuck is lyon not on the map ? 
  i 'm french and i kind of approve the effort . 
  he forgot guyana ... 
  why the fuck is lyon not on the map ? 
  `` the french illegally partitioned several of their colonies before independence , and retain those areas today . 
  when will the french be forced to undo these actions ? '', 
  can you tell me what are you talking about exactly ? 
  french and german bank took low loans and lend it at a higher price to greece : we made money on them , not helping for sure . 
  we cutted liquidity to make sure they would submit and pay for the stupids bondholders . 
  we impose austerity crushing their economy making pay their debt even more difficult . 
  now young greek are forced to go abroad to work leaving debt to retiree and mking money for other states ( well , germany tbh ) the german profited of the greek the most , because every time they were problems with greece , rich greek were putting their money in germans bank , lowering the interest rate of germany . 
   there are literally hundreds of articles that do this yes , the second crisis , not the first one . 
  you 're mixing everything up . 
  it 's indeed because of the euro and the terrible economic decisions ( cut public spending too soon ) we were the only place where we got a second crisis when the us for example let deficit maintain activity . 
  having currency adapted to one country economy soften shocks . 
   he has also talked about leaving nato . 
  you know it 's viewed mostly positively here ? 
  we personally have little interest to be us bitch . 
  if you think russia had no right on ukraine to not want them in nato , wait for the american shitshow when we 're going to leave . 
   perhaps ceding votes to melenchon in exchange for some electoral promises would be the way to go since ps is quite torn already anyways while it could secure a leftist candidate in 2 round . 
  i would like it too . 
  but his party would n't accept . 
  because we 're no ethnic maniac backward, 
  you ca n't only have just citizenship like in other country , it 's nationality or nothing . 
  macron is very americanophile, 
  please continue . 
  the poll you 're reading give 68/32 for m\u00e9lenchon, 
  this article is as shitty as le pen 's ideas . 
  half a million young left during the crisis . 
  yes , basically he really wants to have social and fiscal harmonization , and to stop detached worker ( make companies pay the same price as franch workers for social systems ), 
  why ? 
  have you read the document ? 
  36 % of difference is huge . 
  i 'm from lyon/grenoble , and definitely see torino as cross-border buddies . 
  and if m\u00e9lenchon goes ahead fillon in polls ? 
   the netherlands which has already reached 17 million . 
  yes and then it will decrease , estimated at 16.9 million in 2050, 
   portugal but greece , italy , spain , belgium and even france would be at risk . 
  do n't worry , we 'll be gone together in a fairer currency by then . 
  they 're still on this [ line ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/18/opinion/our-war-with-france.html ), 
  glory to the american europe !, 
  because you have hundred more times dying from a car accident than a terrorist attack . 
  i do n't see any rush on roller . 
  macron is supported by the modem , the majority of ps , and some right winger . 
  he 's like all the rats in the same boat,
