  the complexity is a result of bosses union wanted exceptions . 
  now they say it has to be simplified . 
  they tricked us well tbh . 
  i feel the horror very good , so good painting i think . 
  hi did said that . 
  why did n't they bought european ? 
  according to objectivity . 
  some part of it are nice i [ think ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@45.742026,4.8160284,3a,75y,49.51h,91.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjd5lsnfszjkn9rgz6gmdtg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and definitely better than before . 
   france has no financial culture, 
  the terror was to some extent necessary . 
  for its excesses , i suggest you to better inform on responsabilities . 
  his own speech the 8 . 
  thermidor is a good start . 
  then you can move to historian sources . 
  more precisely , some started to give execution orders like crazy to shift the public opinion to be able to form a coup . 
  nerver said otherwise . 
  you would be surprised of the number of frenchs in the finance industry abroad . 
  on a sidenote , what i replied to you the other day about french right winger bashing france as soon as given the opportunity , checks out now . 
   the environment of europe could support it no . 
  europeans mass immigrated to america . 
  and now we 're arguably overpopulated . 
   why do n't you tell me why you think i 'm wrong ? 
  here 's why : the general trend for convert tend to be way more fundamentalists ( works for anything by the way ) , while people from muslims background may be just culturally muslim deists/agnostics, 
  elections in france , uk and democrats primaries seems to say otherwise but that 's not a very large sample . 
  edit : and apparently according to this article being conservative means moderating your spending . 
  so pretty much useless for the point . 
  `` everybody who do n't think the same as i do is uninformed # 15456215 '' + no argument . 
  now i agree there are portions of ideology that need to be purge from the left , namely anti-nuclearism and tthe iea that we can permanently host increasingly people in distress ( already refluing by the way ) , hopefully the most cancerous ( idpol , which in my mind , is a racialist ideology , french traditionnal approach , only equal citizen ftw ) has n't infected too much europa ( and that 's sometimes more a liberal thing tbh ) . 
  - went from census democracy to universal - abolished slavery - consolidated republic - made the common people have a voice in the republic instead of the bourgeoisie only . 
  pretty high standard to me . 
  i understood him well actually . 
  they do care when they want jewish to emigrate to israel . 
  that 's bullshit on most countries . 
  fake friendliness feels akward and is nowhere nice . 
  that 's even worst if interested . 
   that it 's somehow your national duty to reform or not reform your market for the sake of other countries is n't going to work . 
  well we 're doing it on other countries demand though . 
   there would be some direct german policy/law that creates the surplus agenda 2010 ? 
   that it fails to understand that national policies are being made based on national interests and circumstances the problem here is as well a short term ( make profit now ) / long ( preserve economic environment making profit possible ) term issue for germany . 
   be consistent , world bank actually , it 's my and http://www.naturalearthdata.com/ fault . 
  it 's indeed because of country code . 
  well seen, 
  i was wondering the size of it compare to an human . 
  [ here 's the answer ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/24/ef/91/24ef91bc2caa6b7a2034e7cb77437e43.jpg ), 
  when i 've been there there last year i saw tons of acs in kiev or in the university of a smaller town . 
  i do n't know if it is enough to play a significant role tough . 
  you do n't make `` nations '' pay . 
  let say you set a price for a ton of co2 emitted , which is the common approach . 
  if your enterprise emits x tons and produce y added value , it must pay price * x. 
  so price * x/y is the share of your previously added value you have to pay . 
  so statistically , in a define area , so here a country , co2/gdp ( sum of added value of the area ) is the mean of the share of your added value you need to pay for your carbon emissions . 
  you can hold a similar reasonning on the consumer side . 
   making small nations pay more for their higher co2 no , the previous reasonning assume a same price for the same action . 
  set different prices would be incentive for emitting . 
   you 're poor , here 's some carbon tax on top of your production you ca n't afford , so you ca n't afford it even more , and we expect you to switch to renewables that you ca n't afford even more than normal production with the tax . 
  generally , the advice to avoid loopholes thus avoid incentive comportment which do the contrary of what you want is to still have the same carbon tax for everybody ( so here , a price for a ton emitted ) , and solve poverty problem separetely ( ie , increase transfer to poor countries/poor household ) . 
  this result in low emitting poor country be rewarded and high emitting poor country still have some air to act . 
  on a sidenote , your tone is highly disagreeable for a civil discussion . 
  many really poor countries in africa would be green af . 
  democratic republic of congo :0.11 mali : 0.07 ( same as switzerland ) tchad : 0.05, 
  no , to be able to differentiate low co2/gdp countries . 
  for example , switzerland = 0.07 , germany = 0.21 . 
  so germany emits 3x more per gdp units than switzerland , that 's massive . 
  though i have ukraine with 2 , so 0.07 and 0.21 wo n't be different colored enough . 
  a log-scale for colors come naturally in this case . 
  it does make look we countries worst and ee better . 
   there 's absolutely no point to it . 
  economic impact of a carbon tax for example, 
   if you want to emit less , you want less energy consumption , which mostly also means less economy and less people . 
  the purpose of this map is to show that 's not that simple , as carbon/gdp ratios is not constant . 
  kg of co2 emitted per 2000 dollar gdp of the economy . 
  said otherwise , carbon efficiency of the european economies . 
  that 's just another metric . 
  actually i chose this one because i remember a german in an another thread long time ago on co2/capita complaining that it 's normal if you produce less you emitts less . 
  this metric disable this argument . 
  none is perfect though . 
  i presume poor country + poor isolated building + ac in summer + coal,

  i 've already take a log scale of colors , for being able to differentiate for example switzerland and germany , for which the numbers are not close but close compared to ukraine . 
  look at the color legend , it 's alreay very narrow . 
  do you think i should amplify that or were you sarcastic ?

   french history has been dropped by the left lol . 
  if you hear by ` the left ' the dozens of npa voter , maybe . 
  the right will praise the minimum or even trash the revolution , arguably the most important piece of our history . 
  the left will love to praise important figures like jaur\u00e8s , hugo , robespierre , events like the commune , the scientists and philosophers . 
   the biggest example being the flag , which is usually considered as a far right symbol in political rally explain [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_enj8aprvi#t=0m50 ) then \u00c9dit : and most right winger will trash france and praise america any occasion given . 
  complicate historic figure indeed . 
   robespierre 's personal responsibility for the excesses of the terror was vastly exagerated by  thermidorian reactionnaries modern historians have largely reviewed his real role . 
  [ maximilien robespierre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maximilien_robespierre )  robespierre was an outspoken advocate for the poor and for democratic institutions . 
  he campaigned for universal male suffrage in france , price controls on basic food commodities and the abolition of slavery in the french colonies . 
  he was an ardent opponent of the death penalty , but played an important role in arranging the execution of king louis xvi , which led to the establishment of a french republic . 
   actually you shame her , because her surname was sk\u0142odowska-curie , not by our choosing but by hers so is op then, 
  you equate lenin and stalin ? 
  both lived in gdr, 
  they probably talk each other in german .
