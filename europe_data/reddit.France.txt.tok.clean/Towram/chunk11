  putin is fluent in german and i do n't think merkel is in russian . 
  edit : i was apparently wrong . 
  they 're both good in each other languages . 
  was going to say the same . 
  ask op . 
  not sure but i 'll trust you . 
  yeah he 's the worst . 
  it 's from 2015 . 
  i 'm not sure imf held the current position back then . 
  it 's from 2015, 
  absolutely not nice to remove post created before megathread, 
  trudeau is liked in france ? 
  til . 
  i would say 19/20 barely know who he is . 
   who was being penetrated i was told homosex then was more jerk between the legs than penetration, 
  why do you even need to lump your country in such regional stuffs ? 
  here we do n't label ourself as `` western europe '' , just france . 
  i use the term of eastern europe , and from here , you 're very much east and in europe . 
  username checks out . 
  care to elaborate the nature of the `` threat '' ? 
  still have n't got a source for this posts numbers , so ... 
  yes . 
  yes the data i 'm [ speaking of ] ( https://i.redd.it/ox432lsqdamx.png ) on a side note , i honestly do n't see the differences between that and a god . 
  i think it 's a wording who allows people to distance from religious institutions , as the term of god has been vastly use through history to manipulate the people . 
  acording to eurobarometer , only 29 % . 
  50 % of estonians seems to believe there is some spirit or force . 
  the 40 % 's eurobarometer was : `` i do n't believe there is any sort of god , spirit or life force '' if you spin it differently , i 'm pretty sure this number should increase . 
   i 'm going to want some actual evidence first . 
  [ that comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6l8dpm/mediterranean_sea_ngo_ship_actively_competing/djsvv6r/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) contains explanation too . 
  you 're welcome . 
  the 40 % 's eurobarometer was : `` i do n't believe there is any sort of god , spirit or life force '', 
  source ? 
  for france i 've never seen under 30 % . 
  eurobameter polled 40 % . 
  [ you 've looked wrong ] ( http://imgur.com/a/g9kwl ), 
  it 's impressive , mark others spirit and fit perfectly to the `` make them into prison is useless '' argument . 
  absolutely not . 
  i personnally advocate to bring back guillotine to the public place . 
   but they wo n't , the politicians are in bed with those rich bastards . 
  even if they did , there is a lot of places in europe they would go paying less taxes . 
  probably already the case . 
  charlie hebdo attack guns were legally bought in slovakia . 
   bastille day triggered everytime, 
   the common eu army is not about safety it 's all about purchasing useless weapons from france and germany . 
  nato is all about purchasing useless weapons from the us . 
  not what 's said . 
  it 's easy for a norwegian to say that . 
  you 're not many on a vast country with shittons of mountains . 
  yes you can stock the energy of renewables in the dams . 
  not everybody can do that . 
  see denmark selling you wind energy for zero when they are overproducing and norway sell it back to high price when they actually need it . 
  the renewables are way to expensive . 
  not expensive to produce energy . 
  too expensive to install , connect to the grid , and mostly , storage . 
  the fall in solar panel prices ? 
  reduced labor prices by being produced to china . 
  with coal by the way . 
  we will see the huge externalities as well of these types of producion when it will become massive . 
  solar panels needs a wide range of metals . 
  in my country the all debate around energy revolve around nuclear , because some might think we 're a ` full nuclear country ' . 
  no we 're not . 
  the majority of energy consumed are fossils . 
  not with electricity indeed . 
  if we have money to change our systems , fuck renewables in midsunny region or midwindy regions . 
  let 's produces buses , train , better isolate buildings and change machinery . 
  the defi is huge and this one really effective for the said objective . 
  we should not waste time and money to have an increase in our emissions - pv emits 10x more than nuclear on life cycle - , without even counting the crazy amount of gas ( that wo n't even be available , the north see produces each year less and russia will preferably sell to non conflicting country like china rather than europe , where anyway now with ns germany will consume most of our share ) burnt needed in order to face the intermittence . 
  [ see the energiewende ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:deu:gbr:fra&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:deu:gbr:fra&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr&amp;ind=false ) well , no . 
  that 's normal . 
  that 's one the biggest waste of money ever made . 
  on the same graph you can see in the effect of nuclear installations in france in the 80 's . 
  the effect are a bit clearer . 
  now if you want to : - not acting in the real domains where we can really reduces our emissions . 
  - burn more fossiles . 
  - increase europe 's dependance on russia . 
  this is your right but do n't try to spin it in a different way . 
  now is nuclear perfect ? 
  hell no . 
  but i think finding one football place per decade to store waste is anything but a challenge . 
  the explosion of a 30 years old reactors with old safety regulations , in one of thhe most sismic country made how many dead person ? 
  for now as we now it , 0 . 
  the unscear predict undetectable change of mortality in the long run as well . 
  for comparision , the coal kill 23000 people every year in europe . 
  now , in some reall sunny and really windy regions , go for it . 
  massive eoliennes installation in north see ? 
  solar concentration at tropics level ? 
  but let 's not make stupid decisions in the narrow windows we have to act . 
  do they love coal/gas that much ? 
  pretty much the case in france, 
  italy and germany have always been very similar ( except culturally ) in their history ( divided politically , then unification , wwii ... ) , and economically ( east/west , north/south divide ) , well at least until not that long ago . 
  am i getting trolled ? 
  how many paid harun yahya ? 
  no need to spread your murican bullshits quick synthesis found on the internet : - the word ` theory ' has traditionally been used by scientists to mean something like ' a coherent framework to explain observations ' , so evolution is a theory in that sense . 
  - the common english use of the word theory has connotations of ` the evidence could go either way . ', 
  evolution is n't a theory in that sense , since the evidence is firmly behind evolution . 
  - the scientific method is such that , if and when new evidence emerges , the ` theory of evolution ' will be modified or replaced , and scientists wo n't have a problem with this ongoing development . 
  - ` the theory of evolution ' is an expansive , complex scientific framework , and within it there are disputes and unresolved issues regarding details like how fast it happens and the mechanisms by which it happens . 
  this does not detract from the overwhelming evidence supporting the basic precepts of evolution ( that generations of animal and plant species alter and transform over time in response to changes in their environment and circumstances , and this can happen via several mechanisms , one of which is a process known as ` natural selection ' ) - it is always possible to debate the semantics of words such as `` fact '' and `` proven '' . 
  however , using the common sense of those words , the basic precepts of evolution are as clearly `` proven '' as any other widely accepted scientific `` fact '' ( such as gravity-driven movement of the planets , or the idea that behavior is controlled by the brain and nervous system ) .
