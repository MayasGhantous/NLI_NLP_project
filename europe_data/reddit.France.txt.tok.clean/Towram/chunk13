  meanwhile the guillotine is getting rusty in museum , what a shame . 
  yeah , you 're not going to like it when your currency will double its value . 
  a radiator and at the same time towel dryer, 
  was n't it the eu preventing tsipras to tax big companies ? 
  let 's let the fear of the red to the horned beasts, 
  * for few years, 
  problem solved . 
  like if we have to choose . 
  of course it 's different , that 's your country and here another one . 
   greece has implemented extreme austerity measures bu-but , lazy greeks not wanting to reform ? 
  that 's what my german newspaper told me !, 
  no kidding !, 
  i already feel the collective psychological drama coming . 
  are you serious bro ? 
  what 's wrong with our roads ? 
  look at yours . 
  or maybe make more money from finns ' booze cruises, 
  i want to believe you but [ that ] ( https://magazin.spiegel.de/sp/2017/20/?utm_source=spon&amp;utm_campaign=heftkastenprint ) , [ that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gqrze/emmanuel_macron_and_the_german_disease_if_the/disgk2u/ ) , or the comments [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bfr45/imf_urges_germany_to_hike_wages_and_invest/ ) tell me otherwise . 
  and in the same manner that tories are underrepresented on the internet , i expect this opinion being even more widespread in real life . 
  merkel said treaty change is an option because that 's the maximum she could say . 
  now if as expected te new government is schwarz-gelb , i do n't see fdp willing to go in that direction , but maybe i 'm misleaded about them . 
  i do n't see the link between melenchon and this . 
  i 'm not suggesting any methods for germans to reflate , it 's up to them . 
  ( what do you mean exactly ? ), 
  i guess you 're saying it 's up to other economy to deflate , but it seems you 've missed that 's what has been done since a decade at a great social cost in the south . 
  in france measures have been taken for that in the end of hollande mandate and macron will continue that . 
  now maybe germany has to move a bit too . 
  and just maybe the germans infrastructures really need investment , and maybe it will harm less political stability to raise poor germans wages , which are still unaware of the past decade growth , than diminishing even more the others poor salaries . 
  italy is about to explode goddammit . 
  edit : and ending with neither worker rights or state is not seen everywhere as positive . 
  this wo n't be intentional . 
  a large portion of the german public think this is giving free money to southerner or argue this is impossible to do . 
  see every thread about that in r/europe . 
  see german media rare article about that . 
  i expect that right wing conservatives to be underrepresented here so this views might be even more widespread . 
  edit : and polls are suggesting schwarz-gelb koalition . 
  germans wo n't ever reflate their economy . 
  they 'll just wait europe to break and try to maximize money during the time left . 
  medias bias through their ownership will not fight their short term interest . 
  i 'm also suspecting that 's the only solution they have facing their demography , problem that other countries being screwed by this also have . 
  the nationalist wave will strike back harder . 
   are n't you a little bit tired ? 
  definitely , yes . 
   which the deputy of chamber of commerce considers as `` harmful '' ? 
  do n't be surprised , that 's pretty much his job to say that no matter what . 
  my little pleasure sorry, 
   hahahahaha, 
  the only real persecution around europe of muslims happen in your country bro . 
  [ yes ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_defence_association#deaths_as_a_result_of_activity ), 
  was n't it already the case ? 
  so , was n't your statement a bit quick ? 
  not even the weirdest guy of [ the constituency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/howling_laud_hope ), 
  i seriously do n't get the criticism on russia today : yes it 's russian propanganda , but i mean , they 're honest about it , it 's written on it . 
  they 're not even that much right biased , more like biased toward anyone who has the softer stance on russia . 
  and as far as i remember , i do n't remember fake news coming from them . 
  i 'm not a regular reader though . 
  their quality of articles is not that bad compared to some other newspaper here . 
  ( but sputnik is garbage i agree ) . 
  what a destruction finally !, 
  roughly : left : frondeurs and what 's left of them ` new ' right : em old right : lr nazis : fn, 
  looks like he forgot it was a woman . 
  * 75 , hamon was left . 
  and no , fn is national-socialist , that 's different . 
  the previous government was almost the same shit , i agree . 
  though even valls said he would n't touch the rule of law . 
  american concerned about the comments of a left-wing french politican . 
  weird times , you got me confused . 
  `` socially left , economically right '' people said . 
  `` neither left or right '' he said . 
  new right would have been more appropriate . 
  hehe , impose your langage in the capital if you want to be serious about this . 
  i actually am surprised given how many time i was close to death on italian roads that their number per capita finally seems quite reasonable . 
  ** paris has berlin 's support ** `` more than reaching an agreement for an agreement , the idea is to adopt , at european level , really effective measures to avoid fraud , '' said a high-ranking source close to the discussions . 
  president macron himself publicly agreed during a trip to saint-nazaire ( loire-atlantique ) on 31 may : an agreement between european countries was to be `` concluded on 15 june '' ; it will be staggered so that we can build a true refounding of this european directive of detached work which will allow equal work everywhere to have equal pay , to limit , to better frame and to be able to better control everywhere on the ground the reality of this detached work ... '' . 
  the meeting in luxembourg will be the occasion for a political debate between the ministers ( the french minister of labor muriel p\u00e9nicaud should make the trip ) , the first of its kind for a long time on the detachment . 
  for paris , the aim is to obtain a `` general partial orientation '' at the next ministerial meeting on 23 october . 
  that is to say to obtain an agreement by the council allowing a transition to the final stage of the negotiation , the `` trilogue '' with the strasbourg parliament , both on the revised directive on seconded work and on part of the regulations for the coordination of social security . 
  `` we have three months of intense work ahead of us , '' a diplomat said . 
  france can count on germany , which supported its proposal , according to several converging sources . 
  perhaps also on austria , italy , belgium , also very sensitized to the problem of fraud to detachment . 
  at the commission , president jean-claude juncker has certainly pledged to help emmanuel macron , but also warned him . 
  it will have to succeed in building a majority ( unanimity is not required ) , trying to defeat the resistance of the eastern eu countries , who consider that the attempts to reach the detached labor directive correspond to protectionist reflexes . 
  in brussels as in paris , emmanuel macron began an ambitious program of reforms . 
  the french president promised to `` refound '' the european union ( eu ) so that it `` protects '' the citizens more . 
  without delay , its teams began to work on it . 
  with discretion , of course , but with a determination that welcomes certain european partners of france , and worries others ... 
  the biggest and most important issue for paris is the revision of the posted workers directive of 1996 . 
  this status allows an employee sent by his / her employer abroad to retain the social security cover of his / her country of origin temporarily , a provision accused of encouraging `` social dumping '' between companies . 
  according to our information , the french government has made a series of proposals to tighten the review of european law - presented by the european commission in march 2016 , and has since been discussed at the european council ( the meeting of the member states ) . 
  a posture that is likely to further sharpen the countries in the eastern eu , already quite up against the first draft of the text . 
  france has thus circulated , ten days ago , a text in eight points , which le monde has been able to consult . 
  the document proposes above all to strengthen the fight against fraud at secondment . 
  at this stage , `` the texts under discussion do not provide satisfactory solutions for better combating fraud and circumvention , and in particular against letterbox undertakings [ for example , a seconded worker is employed by a hungarian company , in fact controlled by a maltese structure ] , `` says paris . 
  the twelve-month limitation on secondment of secondment is one of the most significant demands of the french government . 
  the `` detached '' worker would not be able to benefit from this status beyond that period . 
  the text that is currently being discussed in the council has a duration of 24 months , and it does not preclude meter resetting when a worker returns to his country of origin ( he can therefore leave for twenty-four months under this status ) . 
  paris also wants the `` guaranteed rights '' of the posted worker to be strengthened , and in particular that the allowances for `` transport , accommodation and meals '' are explicitly included in his income in order to avoid the classic circumvention of the directive of 1996 for some employers to deduct the accommodation , transportation and / or food from the pay of their workers . 
  the revision of the european commission posits as a principle that `` equal work , equal income '' , but it does not go into much detail . 
  ** a new strategy ** another request targeting mailbox companies : the french wish that the `` a1 '' form ( attesting to the national social security legislation applicable to the worker ) becomes a precondition for secondment .
