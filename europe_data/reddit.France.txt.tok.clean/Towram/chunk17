  beno\u00eet hamon is no longer simply distanced in the polls by m\u00e9lenchon , it has just passed under the symbolic bar of the 10 % . 
  it is enough to undermine the most solid determinations . 
  `` the week of the passage under the 10 % , it threw a cold in the team , entrusts to us today a socialist elected member of the left wing . 
  some began to ask the question of the withdrawal '' . 
  is it necessary to maintain to the end with the prospect of a catastrophic score to the key ? 
  is not there a risk of preventing the left from being in the 2nd round ? 
  so many questions that agitate the candidate and his family . 
  some have begun to ask the question of withdrawal . 
  a deputy from the left wing `` i had been thinking for a few days that beno\u00eet had to withdraw , '' said a member of parliament in regular contact with hamon , `` and then guillaume balas ( coordinator of the project of the socialist candidate , ed . ), 
  told me about himself , asking my opinion . '', 
  indeed , the mep is consulting around him , to get an idea . 
  he is not the only one . 
  `` this has crossed the mind of all the leadership of the campaign , '' confirms our elected representative . 
  for a few days , the candidate himself wonders with his team . 
  the question is finally decided on a saturday morning , at the beginning of the meeting : the decision is made and beno\u00eet hamon , questioned on what he will do , sweeps this eventuality . 
  too late to withdraw . 
  financially , the campaign has already cost more than 14 million euros . 
  legally , some say it is no longer possible . 
  above all , guillaume balas , `` m\u00e9lenchon never sent us the slightest sign or phone call to talk about it . 
  from the beginning , he always said that the dice were thrown away , there would be two candidates left '' . 
  on the financial question , one of the supporters of the withdrawal tried to push the idea of a national subscription to reimburse campaign expenses . 
  sarkozy , with his sarkhoton , managed to raise 11 million euros with his pans !, 
  '' , he argues . 
  not enough . 
  result , this sunday , april 23 , jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon obtains 19.58 % of the votes cast against 6.36 % for beno\u00eet hamon . 
  a little less than 620,000 votes separated marine le pen from the candidate of france rejected . 
  the day after this first round , a socialist from the left wing of the ps who is asked what he thinks of these results sighs , bitter : `` i am disappointed that jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon missed so little '' ... 
  heads i won tail you loose . 
  honnestly he says everything and its contrary one day and another , its not easy to follow . 
  helicopters were a good deal . 
  but poland never miss an occasion to do something for uncle sam . 
  it 's more using ee as cheap labour force for their companies, 
  meh , if they leave we would be salty on billions we gave , but it would a great occasion for europe to work together more easily and finally harmonize lots of stuffs and delete loopholes . 
   he saw the utter failure of ~ ~ hollande ~ ~ ** himself ** to bring down the unemployment rate . 
  if he 's talking about detached workers abuses , it 's good , but he sounds more akin to criticize countries of kaczynsky and orban ( that i do n't like neither ) , but way less to criticize fiscal abuses in netherlands , luxembourg , ireland . 
  hope he 'll talk about both eventually . 
  i mean she has ideas of local production , who would have positive effect but that 's not her goal . 
  he did n't proposed le pen as a solution for his consultation . 
  do n't really know what to think about it . 
   like the m5s in italy ? 
  hope not . 
  so ad hominem is all you have to make sense to what you 're saying ? 
  which fact did you give ? 
  looked like figureless and baseless thought to me . 
   do n't those kinds of people usually vote for the conservative economic right , though , you know , less taxes , less welfare , privatization is good , etc ? 
  they [ did ] ( http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/093/006/006088.html ) . 
  but somehow bloomberg decided only part of date needed to be analyzed . 
  when i consider the catholic church is counting me as catholic , i know which level of confidence to give to these numbers . 
  the maps do n't fit the message - fn voters are the ones who know what is living with muslims - except in 4 departements . 
  i do n't know what you need more, 
  you mean the maps i debunked [ yesterday in a reply to you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/679qkv/french_elections_map_of_1st_round_vs_map_of/dgp6fl7/ ) and you decided to ignore because it does n't fit your narrative ? 
  not really . 
  vote for le pen : 18-25 : 21 % 25-34 : 24 % 35-49 : 29 % 50-59 : 27 % 60-70 : 19 % 70 + : 10 % now if you take into account participation , and if you push the thing to include demography , you might have a very different conclusion of from which category she has her votes . 
  so it looks like its a bad strategy ? 
  maybe metropolitan areas figures would be a different story too . 
  out of 4 candidates around 20 % , they only chose two of them . 
  maybe it would have been more interesting to put that data in the analysis as well . 
  no , a bit on mediterrean coast . 
  fair point . 
  true for any majoritarian group though . 
  `` cities '' doe n't hold any power . 
  it 's the people living inside . 
  and i do n't think it would be fair to decide your vote weight on how many people live close to you . 
  well i 'm mainly speaking of tax evasion , social minimas lowering . 
  i 'm not in a `` seize the means hang the bosses '' state of mind . 
  your comment history say a lot more imo . 
  there 's literallly nothing between blair and / r/fullcommunism that is it ? 
  and , what about answering arguments opposed instead of cherry picking comments where you can repeat your catch phrase ? 
  you 're right . 
   this is basicly the mistake academic philosophy is making that 's also how we ended with up ` new `` philosophers '' ' like bhl on every tv channel, 
  if you read the other comments who would have seen he is not here to discuss but for circlejerking his political agenda . 
  i 'm afraid arguments does n't matter . 
  r/europe is more and more weird lately . 
  like pushing for far-right [ lying material ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/679qkv/french_elections_map_of_1st_round_vs_map_of/dgormz8/ ) and at the same time upvoting en masse horseshoe fallacy and agreeing that democratic processes and not behaving like you are the master of your voters are literally hitler rooting , not taking into account decades of political commitment . 
  and us lefties should be to blame of course . 
  maybe i should stop visiting this sub the time it gets a bit more rational . 
  [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9f6s_j29g4 ) [ are ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6qijobrt5a ) [ lying ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voujumpkpya ) [ and ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7pw824lgeu ) [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50sq8mpkx1i ) [ know ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qei_tlomoi ) [ it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ab-vendsou&amp;t=0m20s ) here you have one link per word of 15 years of commitment against her party . 
  but sure the one who made her ideological roots are the savior , the one who dare to ask his voters ( like dirty peoples ? 
  what a silly idea ! ), 
  if they prefer blank vote for macron after being decredibilized for calling to vote hollande in 2012 is the real danger for democracy . 
  ahah maybe true . 
  though end of dynamism ! = collapse and demography is indeed a serious concern for germany . 
  you 're a liar and you know it . 
  you should be ashamed . 
  did you even heard his speech ? 
  he basically said `` too much socialism , choose liberalism '' . 
  bigotry was not his concern . 
  m\u00e9lenchon apart from that always has been the biggest opponent of le pen . 
  see 2012 legislatives . 
  but you know it already , just saying for others readers . 
  yes and if we make the same reforms they will loose their advantage . 
  what 's next ? 
  probably someone going further to gain sweet competivity . 
  most probable outcome : uneducated and bad health , job unsecurized and trumped population in the long run . 
  meh , a bit on defense , hamon is for less nato and more europe , m\u00e9lenchon refuse to discuss it while we 're in nato . 
  in the east m\u00e9lenchon wants to try desescalation while hamon wanted to make weapon 's sales for showing putin who his the tough guy to launch again the economy . 
  apart from that it 's details . 
  their stances on eu are in fact , almost the same . 
  see the debate between g\u00e9n\u00e9reux and piketty . 
  they 're waiting base will .
