  so i checked . 
  i 've not found anything . 
  never learned italian neither edit : but i 'm jealous of you guys because you can understand each other when talking too . 
  we ca n't say there it 's in france neither , are n't we ? 
  germany has low prices compared to everybody to be honest . 
   famous european solidarity works only in favor of ~ ~ glorious ~ ~ neoliberal ideology ~ ~ western masterrace countries ~ ~ ftfy, 
  happened to me today in dusseldorf airport . 
  i kept answering in german and he kept answering in english . 
  he was german . 
  why the fuck i 've learned german ? 
  it was not for the beauty . 
  i should have learn spanish . 
   also , people in france are proud about napoleon . 
  for me , he is somewhat a dictator and counter revolutionnary , but still i totally disagree with the `` napoleonic war '' view . 
  the rest of europe wanted to destroy the revolutionnary france causing the wars to conserve their more dictatorial power . 
  ( and yeah , the oligarchio-democratic albion pushing them into it ) . 
  so i can understand he can be seen negatively from france , but not really from anywhere else ( except , you know , annexing other countries , but for many people at the the time , at least at the beginning , he was seen as a liberator ) . 
  his bad pr today is more a consequence of the anglo ( american ) cultural hegemony imho . 
  i will start a campaign saying that vaccines grow dick so you should do it . 
  will you stop vaccine because of it being bullshit ? 
  seriously do you have a source ? 
  pretty sure neither guadeloupe or martinique 's d\u00e9partement are tax heaven, 
  i 've been visiting the construction , it was awesome, 
  he 's probably talking about germany as well, 
  he is applying whatever sch\u00e4uble tell him to do . 
  damn , where are you each fucking time this high numbers are explained ? 
  they 're counting rape differently ffs, 
   undervalued overvalued, 
  oh , you 're right,

  ## the ps candidate began a 36-hour visit to portugal , where he will meet with the left-wing leaders who have ruled the country since november 2015 . 
  by bastien bonnefous and alain beuve-m\u00e9ry ( special envoys in lisbon ) benoit hamon in lisbon ( portugal ) on 17 february . 
  they talked to each other ... and then what ? 
  the engagement of a discussion between beno\u00eet hamon and jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , both candidates for the presidential election , on a possible rally turns to a vaudeville . 
  while mr. hamon , who had emerged victorious from the primary on the left , announced at the end of january that he was going to contact the leader of la france insoumise , m. m\u00e9lenchon , seeing nothing coming , sent on thursday 16 february evening a letter to his companion , specifying the guarantees of a lasting alliance between the two men . 
  the first deals with the `` perimeter of convergence . 
  we do not want any agreement , either in the presidential or legislative elections with emmanuel macron and his movement , `` it is written . 
  the second `` concerns your will to assume the break with the policy of the quinquennium '' . 
  and mr. m\u00e9lenchon to cite the abolition of the el khomri law , the tax credit for competitiveness and employment and the state of permanent emergency . 
  all day on friday , the suspense has hovered over the reality or not of their exchanges . 
  arrived in the afternoon in lisbon for his first trip abroad as a candidate for the elys\u00e9e , beno\u00eet hamon closed the debate on the issue . 
  `` i had jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon several minutes on the phone , but you will not know more , '' he warned before the french high school of the city . 
  neither he nor i want to make a serial about it . 
  the gathering of the left is a subject serious enough not to engage in theater . 
  you were worried , we spoke . 
  you 're worried , we 're going to see each other . 
  punto final ! '', 
  hamon on friday began a 36-hour visit to portugal , where he will meet with all the leaders of the national plural left . 
  while in paris , the deputy of the yvelines negotiates an electoral agreement with the ecologists and discusses with communists , the lusophone case stands for him of the example to follow . 
  in november 2015 , the former mayor of the capital and socialist prime minister antonio costa - whom hamon was to see one-on-one saturday - took power by allying himself with the communists and the radical left . 
  this portuguese alliance , known as `` geringon\u00e7a '' ( bringuebalante ) , is for the time being a political and economic success , and mr. hamon dreams of drawing inspiration from it for france . 
  `` here , the lefts are not irreconcilable , but reconciled , '' he explains from lisbon . 
  they have shown that one can get out of austerity , regain a growth path , reconcile economic recovery with social progress . '', 
  `` in the center of the left '' for the deputy pascal cherki , who accompanies mr hamon , `` the primary of january has upset all the plans on the left . 
  the question that is asked to jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon is to find out who is the best of the left and who can win the presidential election : he or hamon ? 
  i think it 's beno\u00eet because , unlike jean-luc , he is in the center of the left , `` says the elected of paris . 
  other candidate for the presidential , the ecologist yannick jadot spoke well with mm . 
  m\u00e9lenchon and hamon , but `` i 'm not a summer camp instructor , '' he says . 
  with the candidate of la france insoumise , the question remains : `` can a common dynamic make sense ? 
  `` explains mr. jadot . 
  with the ps , after two working meetings , the convergences are more serious and could lead to an agreement in the middle of next week . 
  `` we should go out two or three on a project and expand it , '' says mr. jadot . 
  `` mitterrand and marchais succeeded in their time in uniting in the interest of the left . 
  hamon and m\u00e9lenchon should be able to do it too , `` cherki believes . 
  the numbers are fooled by rotterdam . 
  there is few people wanting to go to the perfidious albion , i do n't even know why we are stopping them . 
  also one bridge in paris has often migrants under . 
  apart from that , no migrants . 
  like we took 10 000 . 
  that 's barely nothing . 
  contradictory ideas does not sum the percentages . 
  the masterplan is working mwahahahaha !, 
  something like pegida would be unthinkable in france , there is just different form of expression of the same movement . 
  i sometimes along discussion try to make r/europe more red , does it count ? 
   those corrupt , senile sons of bitches looks like every classic right party in europe . 
  left and ps have voted against too . 
  come on , you 're just 5 to 10 years late . 
  it has no influence but i 'm clearly stating that i care and that i ca n't give a little approval to any of the two projects . 
  yes they are !, 
  since the 2014 law . 
  for me i will go vote : blank . 
  no way i 'm giving fillon any support for his reforms . 
  it 's riots against sodomy in the police habits . 
  better die than giving more weight to that guy . 
   to combat the hugely negative aspects of neoliberalism with sch\u00e4uble ? 
  lmao . 
  companies are going to be allowed to pursue romania if for example the state does n't want the company to ruined the environment because it was a `` business opportunity '', 
  damn just do fucking researches . 
  like it 's not writing lyon on google is something too difficult, 
  guys , you 're a victim of the alternate reality . 
  here are the real numbers , from this world ( you 're right for germany and greece ) : https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/milex-gdp-share.pdf, 
  for what ? 
  https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/milex-gdp-share.pdf it seems there is no lesson to be given . 
  for those who are interested , [ here ] ( https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/milex-gdp-share.pdf ) the spending of every countries . 
  europe is page 5-6 . 
  is this napoleon empire after the victory of trafalgar in an alternate reality ? 
  sadly it would n't be possible to create this technology today with the free market rules . 
  if it 's a one time things , it should not attract anyone , does n't it ? 
  edit : should -  should not, 
  a 360 panorama would be great from this point,
