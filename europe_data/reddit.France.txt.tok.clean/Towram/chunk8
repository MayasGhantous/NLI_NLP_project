  what about that species called humans ? 
   he will have 1 presidency to do what the people do n't want him to do and then just like hollande after his austerity programme he will be politically dead . 
  and then a new fresh face will present himself ( herself maybe ? ), 
  as ` new ' and theater some ` disagreement with the establishment ' and with a huge help from our media will be elected and we will be back in the same situation . 
  looks better than bojo to me . 
  compare 1981 's program who was `` mainstream '' with m\u00e9lenchon 's . 
  that 's almost a french tradition at that point . 
  see mitterand strategy to break the right insuring fn had a tribune . 
  for the 2017 election , it was actually everybody 's interest to be against le pen in the second round . 
  i do n't feel i have to back up this strategy with sources so much it looked obvious but i feel you might want [ some ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/01/emmanuel-macron-french-voters-marine-le-pen ), 
  without even taking hamon into account . 
  trotskist candidates votes were enough to make m\u00e9lenchon beat marine le pen and have macron v m\u00e9lenchon . 
  you should know that keeping le pen hih enough to be in the second round was a deliberate strategy . 
  maybe political leaders giving no other project for the society than vague `` reforms '' . 
  frenchs are no american . 
  it 's 36 % percent actually . 
  because of [ this ] ( https://pics.me.me/me-left-he-center-me-me-raght-me-lenter-right-19511096.png ) . 
  now a light keynesian socdem like m\u00e9lenchon is depicted even here like `` super extra far left '', 
  my ballot said neoliberal but i already regret every piece of legitimity i gave him . 
  nah , i 'm going to repost a screenshot of specifically the part concerned , and give the source in comment . 
   you manage to put all the percentages in the title now you 're trolling me . 
  the only rational explanation i get is that this is actually politically motived . 
  i 'm protesting heavily . 
  i consider the removal is unjustified for several reason : - this is not an article and has no title . 
  the title given is an excerpt of the information in the document . 
  alternatively , consider the post title as an information and the document linked as the source . 
  - it 's common practice here to give the percentage . 
  i would point thas [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xo5j8/france_tns_poll_le_pen_26_macron_25_fillon_17/ ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65bocc/ipsossopra_poll_macron_22_2_le_pen_22_2_m%c3%a9lenchon/ ) or [ 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65bocc/ipsossopra_poll_macron_22_2_le_pen_22_2_m%c3%a9lenchon/ ) are some polls example where the title ( and in this case it has one ) is not reported in reddit . 
  i 'm unsure russia 's power has more control on them than western power have on their counterpart . 
  capital costs are the real competivity problem . 
  i feel you . 
  the number of times i said he was fillon with smile or vaseline and being replied i was exagerating . 
   melenchon and benoit hamon division of the left will i am afraid stuck us with right winger for a long time . 
  polynesie and nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie are to some extent autonomous and not proper departement like guyane , guadeloupe or any metropolitan department . 
  i once in reversely took a woman in burqa in a bus for a cello in its cover, 
  holy shit i realized i really supported none . 
  only a positive a priori for costa and some empathy for tsipras . 
  you too sir . 
  no shit sherlock free and undistorted market ca n't exist . 
  sorry [ fake friend ] ( http://www.linguee.fr/francais-anglais/traduction/faire+l%27apologie.html ) word, 
  i despise macrons apologies as much as systematic previous french bashing . 
  i 've at least understood everything is about good pr . 
  actually , the image of italy has taken a severe hit here since 2006 . 
  the state used the rights it has just like a normal shareholder . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/01/14/extramarital-affairs-topline/ ) is the detail of the survey . 
  the particularity of france does n't really is that many find it morally acceptable but that many do n't label this as a moral issue . 
  plot twist : more coal ( true ), 
  is there anything positive germany is doing these days ? 
   for bulgaria to take over long-term of course , why would you run a business in greece when you pay massive tax to pay back debt when you can fully legally run a business in greece from across the border ? 
  you do n't . 
  both are pretty backward, 
  so we are doing germany 's reform for nothing ? 
  let me prepare my spike . 
  1792-2018 best year of my life . 
  at that time , it was the case . 
   he does seem like a true neoliberal , something i never expected france to embrace so eagerly . 
  the frenchs did n't `` embraced neoliberalism '' . 
  they were indoctrinated of 30 years of `` reforms needed `` in the media + heavy propaganda more than one year before the elections and a nice communication plan . 
  plus the technic of preserving le pen high enough in order to be sure to have a one round election . 
  now it looks more serious, 
  no , that was a bad translation of fuck yeah in latin, 
  it was 2 month ago, 
  and yet i see the same 50 person contributing, 
  why antwaarps specially ? 
  in france they got so used they do n't care anyway now . 
  i love the frenlemish ( or vlranm\u00e7ais ? ), 
  on this subreddit . 
  i 'm fearing the day istanbul is going to be destroyed . 
  more likely to go the other way imo, 
  oh , i thought you wanted to correct me , not being the chauvinistic pissed of guy . 
  oh you 're ( almost ) right . 
  apparently it is brussel ** s ** in english, 
  just in case : `` liberal '' here is not opposed to conservatives , quite the contrary most of the time . 
  china yes , india how ? 
  really ? 
  who gets bruxelles ? 
  ` muh evidence based policy ', 
  you loved the one party state submitted to russia , you will love the one party state submit to the us . 
  you have way too much hope . 
  what ? 
  no , it 's [ here ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/55290+bure/@48.495319,5.3299017,12.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47ec98b7e7b0d6f7:0x40a5fb99a3ae480!8m2!3d48.505655!4d5.358401 ), 
  no need for a leaked report . 
  there is a 11 million people ~ ~ experience ~ ~ experiment running since 1830 . 
   `` after this , declaring that france is responsible for the raid of the vel 'd ` hiv ' is again a threshold crossing of a maximum intensity . 
  no one can deny that french people were personally responsible for the crime as this was the case , in particular , in the police who carried out the raid without expressing the least protest or act of resistance , but also of all the authorities of all kinds who were complicit either actively or by their silence , or because they had renounced to oppose it in any way , but to say that france , as a nation , as a nation is responsible for this crime is to admit an essentially unacceptable definition of our country . 
  france is nothing but her republic . 
  at that time , the republic had been abolished by the national revolution of marshal petain . 
  in this vision of history , france at that time was in london with general de gaulle and everywhere frenchmen were fighting the nazi occupation . 
  in the national territory there was nothing but a nation ruled by a de facto regime in a country half of which was occupied by the nazi armies and the other half ruled by people who had imposed force a twin ideology . 
  never , at any time , did the french make the choice of murder and anti-semitic crime !, 
  those who are not jews are not all , globally and as french , guilty of the crime that was committed at that time !, 
  on the contrary , by its resistance , its struggles against the invader and the restoration of the republic as soon as it was driven out of the territory , the french people proved on which side it really was . 
  it is not in the power of mr. macron to assign all the french to an identity of executioner who is not theirs !, 
  no , no , vichy is not france ! '', 
   indeed , no one can deny that french people were personally responsible for the crime , as was the case , for example , in the police who carried out the raid without expressing the slightest protest or act of resistance but also from all the authorities of all orders which made themselves complicit either actively or by their silence , or because they had renounced to oppose it in any way whatsoever . 
  hmm , i really do n't think so . 
  how fucked up has to be our society , in the context where : - ressources are declining fast - climate change will have huge impact . 
  but when it appears we do not consume as much of a fossile ressource than forecast , the reaction is `` fading hopes '' ? 
  i do that everyday . 
  low - tech ; an ecologic solution ?
