  ca n't translate the whole video though . 
  sorry wrong sub . 
  under oil volume stagnation east expansion was pure madness . 
   finding some cornerstones and scanning the map and scanning and scanning and scanning ... 
  i did the same unsuccessfully . 
   also , i ca n't wrap my mind around how extensively sowjet/russian urban planning copypasted a few designs all over the place . 
  i mean it 's ~ 13km off the first suggestion by fellow detectives fluchtpunkt and ermiri , and still looks like it could be a stone 's throw away . 
  like i said , i found at least ten times the same corner between two buildings through moscow , they did n't had much architect apparently . 
  anyway i had fun you could repeat it as a game probably like `` find that commie bloc from russian porn '' . 
  though i think it 's weird starting browsing porn and probably wanking and then getting focus on the building on the background . 
  you discovered your fetish maybe ? 
   the rooster gained particular popularity on the occasion of the french revolution and the july monarchy , where it was introduced to replace the dynastic lys, 
  [ yes ] ( http://cdn.xxx-porn.pictures/thumbs/original/178/102718/2.jpg ) , [ indeed ] ( http://imgur.com/xnfe7wr ), 
  one party country submitted to one foreign superpower , old habits die hard . 
  i 've been going across maybe ten time that exact corner through moscow with maps this afternoon , not always blue . 
  honestly this is probably common buildings in russia . 
  maybe look more precisely in [ that neighborhood ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@55.5862108,37.6661435,3a,60y,101.91h,107.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sybvyf1dmxz0vkylybzxkjq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , urban density seems more adequate, 
  the cocarde , marianne , the bonnet phrygien , or even [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/armoiries_r%c3%a9publique_fran%c3%a7aise.svg ) . 
  i know very well french history and that does n't mean i have to be okay with adding royalist references in our symbols . 
  over my dead body . 
   france today no . 
   nuclear energy is the most capital intensive technology there is , the costs of one plant are enormous that is just false . 
  http://www.windustry.org/how_much_do_wind_turbines_cost  $ 1.3 million to $ 2.2 million per mw of nameplate capacity installed it 's a website promoting wind energy . 
  let ' take 1.3 million , the lower price . 
  now , let 's compare with flamanville , which got massive overcosts , and is the head of a serie and has been construct individually ( ie , price would go severly down once the first one done , or several done at the same time ) the capacity installed will be 1600 mw . 
  so you need in order to have the same capacity , you need to install 1.3 * 1600 . 
  but , nuclear works at 80 % its capicity on average , wind only 20 % . 
  so you actually need to build 8 milliard 320 million $ worth of wind turbine . 
  but : now you have to connect individually the wind turbine to the grid !, 
  you can add 20 % . 
  it 's now 9.6 billion dollar . 
  i did n't count nimby wanting to have the cable underground . 
  congratulation it costed you the same amount than the most expensive nuclear reactor . 
  you now have non-pilotable energy . 
  two solutions : burn fossiles or multiply the price of the by 4 or 5 trying to stock it . 
  shit fleur de lys again ... two day after our national day . 
  what people does n't understand in the word `` revolution '' . 
   i 'm waiting for the people who told us that germany would never agree to relevant ez reforms to admit they were wrong . 
  hey !, 
  i 'll wait until it 's done but i 'll admitt it with great pleasure . 
  you have to be biased to say this :  from inexperienced political underdog , with no establishment backing, 
  i guess you have the dam to stock it , good for you . 
  be careful that no gaz installation going to be built in the future . 
  yes , but as you know , sweden is not that much into solar + wind , but wood + hydro , which so long are the only two massives renewable energy used . 
  sweden is able too do that mainly because of it 's large area per capita and mountains per capita . 
  that is too say , lots of forest to use and lot of hydro . 
  this is not the situation of most european countries . 
  electricity ! = energy oil refines and use of cars a lot . 
  schr\u00f6der decision was way before 2011 . 
  [ the decrease of nuclear was before that too ] ( https://jancovici.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/chiffres_energie_graph77.jpg ), 
  it was getting better it 's [ no longer the case ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:deu:gbr:fra&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:deu:gbr:fra&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr&amp;ind=false ) . 
   i recommend m.v ramana 's article in this nature publication from 2016 . 
  nice you linked an introduction that says nothing and now i have to pay 18 euro . 
  can you find sth free ? 
   the energy market of the future ( in the developed world ) will not grow in consumption very true  will require regional adaption ( keyword energy mittelstand ) and thus needs decentral , flexible sources of energy production . 
  so it contradicts itself a bit . 
  a nuclear reactor is a regional infrastructure . 
  solar and wind , need to be manage europe wide to face intermittence . 
  and even then , that do n't really seems enough to have something even remotely regular , the wind is too [ simultaneous in all of europe ] ( https://jancovici.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/eolien_graph15-1024x535.png ) . 
  then you say flexible . 
  there is nothing flexible about pv and wind . 
  if you want something flexible you have hydro then fossils ( gaz i think is the better for that )  the centralized , capital intensive mode of production is not suited to modern energy needs . 
  wind and pv are as much if no more capital intensive than nuclear . 
  and as i said it 's more centralized . 
   it 's a pretty relevant policy concerning co2 production  as the other poster pointed out , reduction of fossil fuel reliance , and much more importantly , adaption to a non-growing energy market . 
  did you knew that if i make subvention for photovoltalic in the french grid , if it 's produced in china ( a it often is ) , i actually financed co2 emissions as well as the chinese industry ? 
  so in our case ,  reduction of fossil fuel reliance so , in france , we ca n't really build more hydroelectric dam . 
  so if we replace nuclear by wind or pv , we have to build gaz facilities ( except peak gaz will happen too for europe , and germany said dibs ) so we replace something without fossils with fossils . 
  finally i would say this kind of policies shift the prorities away from waht really matter ( for us at least ) : building isolations and better transportation . 
  well that 's even worst . 
  if one country has mountain and not densely populated , it ccan use biomass and hydro . 
  if it already use it , or has n't the said advantage , the use of other renewable imply use of fossiles . 
  energy ! = electricity . 
  electricity is often only half of the energy consumed . 
  setting target of renewable share is not an ( one of the most ) efficient policy if we aim co2 emissions reductions . 
  the worst is : you actually import half of it . 
  it 's baffling that the we can make such irrelevant policy concerning co2 reduction . 
  economic liberal is the only thing our elites are interested in . 
  original content . 
  data source : world bank . 
  show me any traces of a defence contract mentionning refugees . 
  pyrr\u00e9n\u00e9es keep that south please !, 
  yeah , the equivalent in france was an awful regime who dared to give workers a week of holiday . 
  clearly between that and franco it 's a tie . 
  can someone eli5 how is it useful ? 
  why do n't we just keep the rafale ? 
  i 'm surprised it is possible you never heard about this . 
   rather than rejoicing in their role as the euro 's main beneficiary , let alone feeling guilty about the austerity they 've enforced on the rest of the continent , some germans see themselves as long-suffering philanthropists who 've bailed out the lazy people of southern europe repeatedly . 
  that did n't came alone though , that was the narrative sold by their media . 
  most still buy it . 
   they would be considered `` racist '' for sure with the `` islamophobic '' covers . 
  by who ? 
  when ? 
  what does `` would '' mean here ? 
   buys mandatory immigration quotas for economic migrants from a culture totally different than the european one . 
  there is shit leaking your mouth, 
  the irony is while the campaign there was macron supporters asking mods to act against the too numerous pro m\u00e9lenchon 's post . 
  what did he say ? 
  was he thinking that nuclear produced electricity was somehow radioactive ? 
  wealth ! = income,
