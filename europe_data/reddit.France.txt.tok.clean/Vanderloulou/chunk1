ho yes , there is only a few things that are fully vegetarian that 's true . 
  but a lot of non-vegetarian meal have their fair share of vegetables, 
  but ... ratatouille ... 
  and i know shit about wine, 
  you 're right . 
  i was talking about hard science ( which can be longer too on some occasion ), 
  same thing in the us, 
  i assumed you mean french phd . 
  yes , i realise that when you take into account all the international , then things are different . 
  but i do n't tknow whether they are taken into account in the posted statistics or not though . 
  well , you actually need a bachelor and a master to start a phd in france ( 5years ) . 
  but the phd itself is only three years . 
  really ? 
  i am 27 and should graduate this year ( i 'll be 28 ) , but i am doing a rather long phd by french standard ( 4years , because of agreement with the us ) . 
  it is not very common in france to resume study to do a phd after having already worked a regular job , no ? 
  i expected grenoble as well, 
  going in circle ... 
  this is nice , but the thresholds are going to be really hard to reach . 
  signed anyway, 
  it 's probably not its actual placement . 
  it is just drawn here for size comparisaon with the lhc, 
  ok ... all i see is articles about us being on the verge of an economical apocalypse ... sure , we are not looking great , but i do n't see it being anywhere as bad as they make it out to be . 
  am i missing something ? 
  fun fact : canada is an associate member of the european space agency ( esa ), 
  well coluche ran for presidency ... 
  well coluche was a famous ( and praised ) french comedian who used to make a lot of racial jokes . 
  but he never faced that amount of controversy . 
  he was more mocking the one making the jokes by impersonating them . 
  we do no english so bad speaking :(, 
  ten years is not much ... also we motivated us to act in libya , so it can go both way . 
  i am not saying that they have no influence over us ( we are ally after all ) : but calling us a puppet is pretty harsh . 
  i do n't know ... not going in irak is not really a puppet move ... 
  i would have expected to see / r/soccer higher . 
  also . 
  where the hell is / r/murica !!? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ subreddit ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ makes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ cry ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ inside, 
  well i see you edited your post . 
  `` i heard that jews eat their babies alive and sacrifice goats to satan '' do you mind if i ask for source for that kind of sayings ?

  i wish my friend ... 
  i wish, 
  france , i am disapoint, 
  also ump : the right wing in france decided to be against gay marriage . 
  they have huge influence, 
  i am not very proud of this ... 
  which country are you from ? 
  law-land ? 
  [ yes . 
  refreshing !, 
  yeah me too . 
  but i ca n't remember why though ... 
  well , it 's only 3-4 country, 
  why scandinavian are always first in everything :(, 
  i agree , but i still think jussieu is worse ( well it has been renovated , but some old buildings remain , and they are just horrible ), 
  it is not a great building , but i would n't call it ugly . 
  plus is offer a nice view of all paris with the eiffel tower in the landscape . 
  me too , if i have to choose one parisian building i would go for [ jussieu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/97opfuk.jpg ), 
  well , last survey i 've seen about gay marriage in france was more around 63 % though, 
  i 'm french , but i leave in texas ( 2years ) ... 
  it 's slowly changing me . 
  i 'll go back home soon though, 
  also the fact that y' all speak very good english, 
  you do sound cynical though ... but the sad part is that you might be right, 
  i it is supposed to be temporary anyway : they will likely start to reduce it next summer ( if it ever pass , but i think it will ) . 
  this is part of the austerity measure . 
  i am not against it as it shows that everybody is working together to deal with the crisis . 
  learning a language is not that easy . 
  in a short term view , it is probably more convenient to get the job and then learn how to speak while being there, 
  what kind of job do you have ? 
  i 'm only asking because i live in usa , i plan on going back eventually , but i still an international atmosphere . 
  which culture is n't to any other, 
  in paris , girls are quite uptight . 
  there is still the same rule as everywhere ( drink , fuck , etc. . . ) , but night life is so expensive that you better be quite wealthy if you want to satisfy a demanding woman . 
  of course , there is exception . 
  elsewhere in france , girl are more open minded in my opinion . 
  i wonder if this question will still be relevant when we will all have a way to translate everything in an other language using this little thing we call smartphone . 
  i give it 5-10 years before it become totally reliable and smooth to use . 
  it 's not about forcing anyone to do anything . 
  it is about what is the most profitable . 
  the least profitable tends to disappear : movie makers from europe are more likely to use american standards for making film because it has been proven more effective . 
  in that process some `` culture '' has been lost to what is best , economically speaking . 
  yeah , i was not willing to cite kings and other emperor . 
  but i guess de gaulle and jaures might be good picks, 
  i am conficted about this one . 
  this is a very vague concept . 
  some people who are ethnically french today , were not ethnically french 200 years ago . 
  every society evolve with time , europe is not a museum . 
  i did n't know that . 
  so i take your point . 
  but it only say that these guys are racist , nothing else . 
  not that they are not a non negligible part of european population . 
  though i am saying that , but i agree with you , i think and i hope they are just a loud minority . 
  you might be right , but so far , i have no reason to believe that, 
  so you apply a genetic parameter where i would only see a administrative one ( legal or illegal ) ... so you say , white are better than black or arab ... ok i guess we are going to disagree . 
  well , that is the power of the internet though ... anonymity, 
  you can start by not seeing any form of immigration as a disease to be cured ... 
  i am not talking about the illegal immigration which should be of course controlled . 
  but if a non white has been granted the french nationality , it is his right to ask the same right as any other french . 
  period .
