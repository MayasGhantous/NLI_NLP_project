in the end war is often a numbers game ukraine would win the numbers game because every able bodied man would go fight . 
  in a nation of 45 million people , that 's a lot of fighters . 
  additionally , every able bodied woman would be there out at the field hospital helping take of the wounded or would be tended to logistical needs 24/7 . 
  ukraine , despite its lack of wealth , is home to a very well educated populace ( rates of education on par with that of wealthy countries ) . 
  ukraine also produces a disproportionately high amount of scientific research for a country of its demographics . 
   or the entire period of 2014-2018 . 
  you do know that they are only 1 year into this period , right ? 
   they will raise the pension age good . 
  i do n't know why this is seen as being so evil . 
  no it was not done to purposely plot against russia , we are seeing oil prices plummet because american entrepreneurs developed technology that allowed them to extract massive amounts of previously unusable oil in the american midwest and canada . 
  the influx of the midwestern american and canadian oil created a glut in world oil supply . 
  combine this glut of supply with falling demand from europe because of its sluggish recovery , and you get a perfect storm of low oil prices . 
  it 's one of those `` news of the weird '' stories . 
  bbc ca n't be all `` isis and putin '' 24/7 , ya know . 
  my biggest annoyance is that pakistan is training with nato . 
  pakistan and its military are terrible institutions and should be shunned by the civilized world . 
  yup , * la civilisation berb\u00e8re * seems to have a bright , europeanesque future . 
  which is only natural since they were euro-focused for thousands of years , until the islamic conquests . 
  for example , there was an entire dynasty of roman emperors who were * berb\u00e8re * , the [ severids ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lfnctqu.jpg ) . 
  was it worth it ? 
  we shall see . 
  france had an age of tumult after her revolution , i 'm not sure why we should expect libya to be any different . 
  another reason why it may have been worth it is that it did take gaddafis forces out of the chaos . 
  this is good because that prevents the rebel militias from developing into stronger forces via gaining valuable war experience against a traditional army . 
  one of the reasons we saw isis and al -- nusra front become such deadly fighting forces was because they were engaged ( and still are ) in a long , intense campaign against the traditional armed forces of bashar al -- assad which honed them as fighting forces . 
  the same phenomenon happened in the 1980 's with the mujahideen in afghanistan as they fought the soviets . 
  i have great admiration for the portuguese and the astounding achievements that the portuguese people have made .

  you 're downvoted because you were politically incorrect but to be honest i was very surprised to find out that sharia law has nothing to play in this, 
  read that entire introduction and was confused because shariah law was n't mentioned once ... 
  yes , the money china has invested in ukraine may be peanuts for the chinese dragon ; but the yield of those investments are no small thing . 
  china has a massive population , that is ever consuming more and more . 
  china 's agricultural output is strained to produce enough food to feed this burgeoning population - especially as china 's rural farmers move into urban areas and start becoming net food consumers rather than net food producers . 
  that 's where ukraine comes in . 
  as is known ukraine 's thick , loamy , black * chernozem * soil is the most fertile soil on earth . 
  china needs the output of ukraine 's * chernozem * to fulfill is agricultural needs . 
  who the hell is talking about poor little hungary ? 
  contrary to whatever your backwards belief is , hungary is not that poor . 
  also we are talking about the sale of an energy company to the kremlin . 
  the kremlin has long been using energy as a way to manipulate europe and to give russia another tool to do so is a threat to all of europe , hungary included . 
  keep in mind that this deal is being brokered by corrupt hungarian politicians not by honest hungarian entrepreneurs . 
  that 's a terribly misguided view . 
  the global economy is so intertwined that if something negatively effects europe , it negatively effects the united states . 
  look how the collapse of greece had huge repurcussions on the u.s. also why do you think nato exists and why the us puts so many resources into europe 's defense ? 
  why would the us do all this to protect and reinforce europe if it was in the us 's interest to see europe fall ? 
  the title * should * read `` france and germany are mounting a diplomatic offensive ... '' why we europeans are n't taking care of this problem ourselves is beyond me . 
  it 's time to stop pussy-footing around and waiting for the united states to do all our heavy lifting . 
  people complain about being america 's `` poodle '' but this is our fault . 
  we are the ones who chose to become poodles instead of rottweilers . 
   do n't try to tell me the us does its business less dirty ... 
  this is n't about who does business the dirtiest , this is about a strategic move to prevent a business deal that would ultimately lead to greater instability in europe . 
  america is no saint , but right now we europeans ought to be more focused on how the russian bear is trying to dig its claws deeper and deeper into europe 's flesh . 
  europe has dozens of fta 's with parties throughout the world , the only reason this is making such a ruckus is because this is an fta with the united states . 
  so let 's be honest , the reason why the far left opposes ttip is because of blatant , hysterical anti-americanism . 
  fta 's have showed us europeans , time and time again , that they are economically healthy and lead to prosperity for all economic classes . 
  yes , there are brief `` adjustment periods '' after fta 's come into force that are difficult for some , but this difficulty dissolves as soon as economies adjust to the new dynamic . 
  europe really needs the economic boost this would provide . 
   middle ages  30 years war want to know what those two things have in common ? 
  they happened in the past in a society that was radically different than our modern day societies . 
   instead of a thousand words video [ goes viral ( gfycat ) ] ( http://gfycat.com/grosslegitimateankole ) nsfw . 
  what 's up with doing the sign of the cross so many times ? 
   comments bahahaha are you mad ?? 
  all those commentator people are insane . 
   also , would n't the uk decrease its power on the political arena in the world in sizes if it leave the eu ? 
  they would probably be freed to buddy up even closer to their anglosphere family thing with america , australia , new zealand and canada . 
  sounds like a horrid idea . 
  these people who go to fight for daesh / isis are downright mad , and while some of them may be truly repentant , i would n't put it past a whole lot of them to feign repentance so they can continue operations in europe . 
  i just do n't trust anyone that is associated with isis / daesh at all . 
  lulz, 
  so ... why is it bad that usa capitalist is offering a box of eggs ? 
  communists do n't like eggs ? 
  if you saw it flying irl you would n't think that . 
  if they got their shit together , they could successfully market themselves as such . 
  provided daesh does n't destroy all of the ancient ruins first . 
  but it 's legacy is not gone because there are numerous archaeological sites , genetic markers etc. 
  also carthage has a history under roman rule as well and one can quite clearly draw a line from punic carthage to roman carthage to vandal carthage to the arab conquests to medieval tunisia to french tunisia to modern day tunisia, 
  well whatever you want to say about it , it 's certainly has the potential to paint itself as the successor to carthage for tourism purposes . 
  in case people do n't know , modern day tunisia is the successor to ancient carthage . 
  tunis is to carthage what athens is to classical athens or what london is to londinium . 
  [ tunis-carthage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rpsb1bn.jpg ) [ aeroport de tunis carthage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oukmven.jpg ) edit : the country is named after an ancient punic goddess , tanith / tannou whose latin name is tunus ... http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanit, 
  you mean the dictators had more secular ideas about religion . 
  and your argument is quite wrong because states that have the us 's ire are wild islamic states like somalia , yemen , afghanistan and the pakistani tribal areas . 
  i was going to say that this would be a better idea if they were celebrating he anniversary of their opium wars with china , 
  but hat is in large part due to russian destabilization which would disappear with romanian security, 
  yea it does , there 's a war going on and she 's rooting for the other side . 
  they did n't beat the shit out of her or kill her , just humiliated her . 
  that 's really not significant for this . 
  we both know that there are a shit ton of neo-nazis in that part of the world , on * both * sides . 
  language and culture . 
  i 'm mean , belarusian ukrainian serbian and russian are not that dissimilar just as english scottish welsh and irish are not that dissimilar . 
  too bad russia does n't have a relationship with belarus , ukraine and serbia like the us has with britain , australia and canada . 
  i think the analogy is valid . 
  the anglo family seems to get along a lot better than the slavic brothers . 
  the ottomans flew the same flag of muhammed as isis in their vienna campaign . 
  it 's a part of the whole global caliphate thing . 
  osama bin laden , a saudi , expressly states that he chose september 11 as the date for his attacks because the siege of vienna occurred on september 11 . 
  september 11 1683 marked the decisive end of islamic conquests . 
  osama bin laden wanted september 11 2001 to usher in a new era of islamic conquests .
