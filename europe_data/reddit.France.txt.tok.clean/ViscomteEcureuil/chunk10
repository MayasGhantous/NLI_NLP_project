  if so it 's because i 'm calling it like it is : there 's nothing wrong with russia , her achievements prove that , it 's the kremlin that 's chained her down so she ca n't squish them as they suck her blood . 
  on national television ... and totally false , ** do n't you understand that these performances are designed to suffocate the progress of the russian people ? 
  `` lobotomy '' is a spot on title for the doc - the russian national psyche is indeed being lobotomized by putin and the kremlin . 
  the russians have a rich history of artistic , literary , intellectual and scientific achievement on par with any european power ... 
  but now , that facet of russian culture is being amputated in a dangerous new way . 
  the soviets at least embraced science , progressive psychology , progressive sociology , and encouraged a lot of interesting cinema ( propaganda , yes , but there was often a lot of depth too - unlike rt ) and even the tsars encouraged a refined culture of music , art , architecture , and technology ( think about the hermitage , the bolshoi etc ) . 
  putinist russia only seeks to prop up the facade of a great society , even if it actually ends up weakening russian society . 
  i hope the russians do rise up , one final time . 
  edit : and i really feel like they belong with us in the west ; they are europeans with a christian-based culture that has it 's foundations in rome and athens . 
  ah yes , the bbc propaganda machine ... 
  most notoriously known for the times when it turns on its government and it 's governments closest allies . 
  [ the war party ] ( http://youtu.be/jila-zebui4 ) - a bbc panaorama doc that is scathingly critical of american and british foreign policy, 
  not really ... euromaidan press is more like ukraine 's equivalent to ... this [ webpage from the american humane society ] ( http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2014/07-08/?credit=web_id66423299 ) i.e. 
  a group of independent political activists writing a publication to shine light on their cause . 
  it is * not * a government run propaganda network designed to further the geopolitical interests of ukrainian elites, 
  see !, 
  this is what i mean !, 
  they are truly majestic creatures , but those lupines certainly have a certain preference for french flesh and blood . 
  edit : [ wolf attacks on cyclists in quebec ] ( http://ici.radio-canada.ca/emissions/cafe_boulot_dodo/2011-2012/chronique.asp?idchronique=309827 ) and [ the * loup-garou * of louisiana ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rougarou#louisiana_folklore ) ... loups love french blood !, 
  i 'm so glad that wolves are making a comeback in europe !!, 
  we really need to rehabilitate our megafauna and such . 
  that being said , i ca n't help but think about this one winter in the middle ages where a recorded ( so there were probably more unrecorded , because middle ages ) ** 40,000 ** people were eaten by wolves in france . 
  40,000 + people in one winter , in france alone . 
  just goes to show how much the wolf population has declined since then . 
  anyone else get sad when they saw the russia pictures ? 
  so much history and potential , such a tragedy that their westernization / modernization / democratization has come to halt, 
   united left group ... communist party yes , it is the calling of every true leftist to fight to defend the virtuous neo-feudalist , oligarchic , russian mafia state and it 's interests ... 
  just spent the last minute scrolling up and down on my iphone , watching the o 's roll past . 
  thank you , good times were had, 
  i do n't know if i should be disgusted by your political views or [ impressed that a dalmatian such as yourself learned to use a computer ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7jy1xt8.jpg ), 
  ukrainian mentality : the average russian overwhelmingly approves of the invasion of ukraine , yet the ukrainians still feel bad for the average russian when the consequences of said invasion sink in good people , those ukrainians are . 
   / u/pekkaheinen  swedish flair  saying swedish things are n't also sometimes finnish or finnish things are n't also sometimes swedish the swede named ** pekkaheinen ** denies overlapping nature of certain finnish and swedish things \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  yea blame the eu and us , not the kremlin . 
  really solid logic, 
  okay , let 's just let russia take over all of eastern europe ... then we can have a superpower controlling us from ** both ** sides !!, 
   pig cartilage and bone based products ... that 's the stuff they consider treats . 
  hahaha i 'm sorry , but are you telling me asians consider ** doggy ** treats to be a ** human ** delicacy ?!? 
  oh shit , powerful pear farmers guild is going to rise up !, 
   western imperialism not my fault were better than everyone else . 
  btw , a marxist society is inevitable . 
  we either slowly evolve into a marxist global community or we have terrible revolutions . 
  honestly , what do you think would happen in europe if another massive financial crisis like the 2008 one , hit today ? 
  spain , greece , portugal , france , italy would all fucking explode . 
  and when france and italy explode , germany and britain explode too ... then the us has a `` super occupy wall street '' with ** white , middle class , middle aged people furiously rioting ** ( as opposed to youngsters and hippies who protested at occupy wallstreet post-2008 ) if the white , middle aged , middle classes of the western world get fucked by another financial / economic collapse happening too soon ; then capitalism is done . 
  period . 
  tl ; dr * if middle aged , middle class white people get economically destroyed in massive numbers ; then capitalism is over *, 
  china has influence on the continent , yes . 
  but id say france has as much influence as china ( if not more , since china 's influence is economic and our influence is economic + security + history + linguistic + cultural ) britain is in a similar position as france . 
  italy and spain are also important powers in north africa . 
  portugal has important cultural ties to many african states as well . 
  the usa also has tremendous influence , particularly military influence ( the americans are responsible for training probably 70 % of sub-saharan militaries ) . 
  not to mention the african-americans have a profound impact on african pop culture ( hip-hop is big in africa , the african-americans have a big cultural influence on french africans immigrants as well ) also , sub-saharan africa is ** very ** christian , and they still see europe as the heart of christendom . 
  european and european diaspora influence and connections in africa run deep in a way the chinese could never match . 
  jesus , you 're alternative is dumb as shit, 
  hey , it 's transnistria !, 
  the largest source of black market weapons on earth !, 
  if the russians leave and law & order returns ; where will all those african warlords and latin american narcotraffickers get their bazookas and ak-47s ? 
  us did it , uk did it , japan did it ... all the other cool kids are doing it so let 's do it too, 
  so a german will be in charge of us forces in europe ? 
  edit : oh god the comments ... crazy rt comments, 
  if we ever start colonizing the world again , latvian will finally get it 's time to shine . 
  czechia can into multiculturalism too !, 
  fuck , that 's so creepy . 
   tomio okamura til czech names can sometimes look amazingly japanese . 
  also , disgusting comment by okamura-san . 
   hardcore polish nationalist you 're flair description literally describes exactly why we need the eu . 
  the supermajority gained by victor orban in hungary is another example of why we need the eu . 
  ** war ** and for those who doubt , please open your history textbooks from primary school . 
  if i would have heard this idea a year ago , i would have said it 's bull-honky . 
  but now i have to say that it is definitely ** not ** bull-honky , but given recent events ; it 's a rather an astute observation . 
  edit : for those who do know of [ bull-honky ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bull%20honky ) . 
  first thing that pops into my mind was a nature program i was watching about great white sharks chasing sea lions of by california . 
  at one point the little sea lion jumps out if the water and onto the boat with the camera crew . 
  did little sea lion belong on the boat ? 
  did anyone care that little sea lion uses the boat to escape giant shark ? 
  no , of course not . 
  yea but ... jews assimilate nowadays . 
  really though , jews are known for being tailors and jewelers . 
  how can that be seen disruptive ? 
  i 'm familiar with \u00e4 ... but i have no idea how it would sound at the end of word . 
  mostly in german it 's in the middle ( v\u00e4ter ), 
  did n't the germans nix the ability of a company to sue a government ? 
  ** \u0117 ** how do lithuanians pronounce it ? 
  as in grybauskit ** \u0117 ** i 've always read it as grybauskit-uh ? 
  correct ? 
  well . . we could do the same . 
  but jesus what a bleak thought . 
  all those people , all that history , the architecture , wildlife ... 
  if you really reflect on that , you feel like we really are just little sacks of biochemically active meat crawling around on some random rock, 
  someone needs to tell those people that a war with europe would mean the end of the russian state as the world knows it . 
  we have evolved into a very pacifist culture , but if we are forced too , we could field an unstoppable military machine . 
  the kremlin should be terrified . 
  quotas for ** elected ** officials have no place in a true republican democracy ... quotas for ** appointed ** officials , especially unofficial quotas that were promised during the election ** do ** have a place . 
  we are a the most advanced civilisation on earth with three-quarters of a billion people . 
  rest assured , there are enough qualified women in europe to satisfy the 9 positions promised by juncker during the elections . 
  they actually are terrorists ... 
  i 'm writing to my national and european level representatives about this asap . 
  hollande , fm fabius and baroness ashton included . 
  just a short paragraph telling them about how disgusted i am with entire crisis in east ukraine , with the mh17 mass murder and with the unknown number of civilians butchered by moscow 's thugs . 
  i 've never written to politicians before , but i think they need to know that european citizens are angry about this insanity .
