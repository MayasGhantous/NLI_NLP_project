  antisemitism is on the rise because islam is on the rise, 
  romanian = french that got raped by slavs and ottomans, 
  and here , ladies and gentlemen , we have some punk armchair general . 
  he has only read at max three articles on euromaidan and the ukraine-russia affair ( two of them from rt.com ) . 
  and now he , whose shirt is covered in the greasy remnants of the ` kraft brand mac and cheese ' he ate for dinner last night , sits at his computer typing outrageous statements condemning the leadership of a brave and imperiled eastern european nation . 
  * fucking awesome *, 
  no , not sarcasm . 
  if paramilitaries were tearing up southern france ; i would want paris to incinerate them with ballistic missiles . 
  mysterious and intriguing ... 
  i agree , but then what would you say to someone who says that an american who has considerable german ancestry ( 50 % + ) is not a german ? 
  ... now we are in strange territory . 
  someone who has german citizenship is not always considered german because they are not ethnically german . 
  then at the same time , someone who is ethnically german but does not have german citizenship is also not always considered german . 
  then you say : one needs to be ethnically german and have german citizenship to be german ... then what are those germans ( ! ), 
  okay ... good ... that 's what id hope my government did if there were a bunch of spanish backed insurgents terrorizing the french border region, 
  the current ukraine saga began in november 2013 when yanukovych made a snap decision to reject the eu association agreement . 
  yea ... about that ... it should be made perfectly clear that russian involvement in this situation is solely to fortify the position of current government in the kremlin . 
  moscow is spending billions trying to destabilize ukraine when they should be focusing on stabilizing russia . 
  every cent spent on weapons for thugs in ukraine should be spent on aids prevention and healthcare . 
  what 's wrong with establishing that it was n't a white supremacist , neo-nazi ? 
  let 's be real , a surge in antisemitism among ethnic germans would be a much juicier scandal than a surge in antisemitism among muslims who live in germany . 
  germans have a pretty hardwired guilt about their past antisemitism ; no need to senselessly inflame that shame and guilt on ethnic germans when it 's undeserved . 
  thus , not german . 
   destabilized yea but , there 's we 've also stabilized a shit tonne of regions too . 
  and it 's not like those places we `` destabilized '' were n't already a fucking mess to begin with . 
  i mean , are you gon na bring up afghanistan ? 
  because that place was an anarchic dystopia long before nato boots stepped on the ground . 
  wow , your analysis of the situation is ** so ** december 2013 . you 're about 9 months behind the / r/europe curve , bud . 
  that accusation was thoroughly discussed and rejected a long time ago . 
  what ... you do know that russia completely destroyed ukraine in a apocalyptic scorched earth policy with the sole intent of creating a buffer to protect moscow . 
  the russian sfsr squeezed the life juices out of ukraine to fortify moscow and it 's satellite regions . 
  * warning !, 
  : this comment contains moderate chauvinist imperialist nostalgia !, 
  * ... ...  thoughts on kinshasa well , i think that 's just swell . 
  i 've always considered francophone africa to be france 's `` latin america . '', 
  glad the numbers are starting to secure this . 
  okay , i would support an educational program where the children are taught in a roma / french mix at first with the aim of getting them fluent in french . 
  as they progress , more and more of their curriculum should be in french until finally they receive their education fully in french . 
  well yes , because if they tried to live the traditional gypsy lifestyle they would all get eaten by polar bears . 
  watching that makes me really * really * ** really ** hope russia can get back on track to becoming more european and free . 
  gosh , i wish medvedev would have stayed president and that putin would have just retired . 
  russia would still be making progress ... now it 's just military might and heartache . 
  but what about ** / r/yurop ** ? 
  nyt and such publications are quite valid ; as valid as the guardian or spiegel . 
  but i will say fuck the fox news and crazy american neoconservatives sources , those are almost as shitty / crazy as rt, 
  why the fuck is rt on here ? 
  that site does n't deserve clicks . 
  edit : yep , the sub quality has already taken a nosedive, 
  ever seen that comic of a circus bear trying to balance on a ball , finally getting balance on said ball , then gets really vicious / aggressive which then causes him to fall off the circus ball ? 
  that 's russia throughout history . 
  number one , the american revolutionaries were not former members of the french military and were not chronically drunk . 
  they were actual revolutionaries . 
   will you also declare the american revolution a french plot ? 
  number two ; it definitely was not a french plot , but to be honest it would never have been successful without french support, 
   not an invasion ah yes , just a `` civil war '' fought by foreigners, 
  haha no he 's being partly serious & partly funny , in seriousness he 's saying that there would be no indecisiveness . 
  funny because a soviet europe is a silly thought, 
  hey !, 
  that 's great news !, 
  latvians who do n't like france : 1 latvians who like france : 1,997,499 ;-) demographics source : wikipedia, 
  well , if there was n't a war with the second most powerful military on the horizon i would support the protestors ... 
  but since that 's not the case , i have to say the government really does have a stronger argument than the protestors, 
  there are a lot of russkies and ukrainians living there i think ; got moved there by the soviets and stayed ; only have kazakhstani citizen . 
  probably still feel european though, 
   he ate pasta without sauce fascinating . 
  that 's all i need to know . 
  are you sure you are n't actually german ? 
  because his joke flew right over you 're head, 
  an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, 
  definitely ** spain . 
  ** why ? 
  i 'm not sure but i love the soul of place . 
  maybe it 's the astoundingly rich culture : the different regional cultures , the mediterranean culture , the western culture , the latin culture , the latin american cultural exchange , the moorish traits , the catholic presence , the roman ruins ... yea it 's all so great, 
  good . 
  will probably save more than a few vulnerable ukrainians from freezing to death this coming winter ,, 
  it 's really does n't matter if it came from russia or not ... 
  the weapons used and the operators of said weapons ** did ** come from russia . 
  i assume installing and using a missile system on the territory of a sovereign nation is just as much an act of war as shooting missiles into the territory of a sovereign nation, 
   i imagine the us has satellites in that area 24/7 now keep in mind that military and intelligence services do n't always reveal their intel for fear of revealing technique, 
  do n't worry , the argentines would gladly host the laser-penis for the purpose of ejaculating on the english queen, 
  in addition , i propose a giant ejaculating penis aimed at the queens residence . 
  if she is at buckingham palace , it ejaculates on buckingham palace . 
  if she is at windsor castle , it ejaculates on windsor castle . 
  if she is making a state visit to a commonwealth nation , it will ejaculate on said commonwealth nation . 
  ( ex : the queen visits new zealand , the laser-penis is installed on * nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie * and from there ejaculates on new zealand for the duration of her visit ) . 
  better late than never . 
  good word though , i accept it . 
  i mean it 's kind of a dig at france but at the same time the root of the word is french and it it * is * true ... 
  i 'm guessing that was pr gold in the eyes of the russian people, 
  okay yea , let 's allow putins russia to regain superpower status and return europe to the dark days of the cold war and start initiating proxy wars with the us in latin america and africa . 
  is that what you want ? 
  because if russia dominated ukraine , it 's superpower status would be restored . 
  no , fuck you for 1 ) letting russia strangle us all and 2 ) saying ukraine is irrelevant . 
  i would have ; and they should have . 
  i see you 're point , and you 're argument is strong . 
  but most muslims are going to syria to fight for the establishment of an islamic state ruled by sharia law . 
  this swedish dude went to fight to save the white race ( which is silly ) * however * he is actually fighting to protect a democratic nation against an authoritarian plutocratic aggressor . 
  if your actions are supporting the stability of democracy ; then ** the results ** of your actions are in line with swedish cultural / national values ( even if your ** intentions ** are not ) if your actions are supporting an extremist islamic caliphate ; then the results of your actions are contrary to swedish cultural / national values ( in this case ** both intention and results ** are not ), 
  if you researched more you 'd see that it 's funded by russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, 
  did you read the interview with the donetsk people republic separatist from armenia ?
