  because ** that ** whole fiasco would make an ** awesome ** video game ... ... 
  there are multiple story lines : pro-russia campaigns : * in one campaign you play as an honorable armenian guy who thought the russian propaganda was real ( he has a change of heart at the end of the campaign after the separatist thugs command him to murder a dissenting orthodox nun ) * and another campaign as a * spetsnatz * colonel who is a veteran of the afghan war and has severe ptsd , which has made him extremely paranoid euromaidan campaigns : * one campaign as a devout chrisitian , family man sbu agent ( this is the most difficult campaign in the game ) , * and another campaign as a gorgeous ukainian jewish woman with dual israeli-ukrainian citizenship and who was given extensive martial arts / melee weapons training by the israeli army - she could forget about ukraine and stay in israel but she is a deeply patriotic ukrainian patriot who sees herself ukrainian first , jewish second * the story sticks to the somewhat to actual events , but also takes creative liberty to add excitement *, 
  do n't say that shit, 
  are n't indians and kebabs mortal enemies ? 
  or hey could join a band of gypsies . 
  i 'm sure they appreciate the influx of pure indic blood, 
  should not be brics should be `` c '', 
  confused me , i thought you were talking about italy because of the river po, 
  firstly , none of the countries you mentioned are in south america and second , you need to state the soviet interventions as well if you care about accuracy and the truth . 
  read edit, 
  noam chomsky does not give accurate history . 
  everything he says is hyperbole ... you should know he is ** not ** a historian , he is a linguist . 
  he was the kind of guy who thought that the soviet union was actually a socialist paradise , but western propaganda tricked everyone into thinking otherwise . 
   monroe doctrine you did n't read that wikipedia article , because the monroe doctrine was an attempt to keep the napoleonic wars and other european wars from being fought in the new world . 
  relevant quote from the article : `` sim\u00f3n bol\u00edvar himself , still in the midst of his last campaign against the spaniards , santander in colombia , rivadavia in argentina , victoria in mexico -- leaders of the emancipation movement everywhere -- ** received monroe 's words with sincerest gratitude ** '' edit : see this is the shit i 'm so sick of all this politically charged pseudo-history that ignores all important facts and context, 
   unipolar american world the problem is that americas unipolar moment is closing , the asian giants are rising . 
  asia 's rise is unstoppable . 
  then everything is messy in the world , and the us wo n't be able to hold on alone forever . 
  what i want is * for the eu to have at least some of its members create a tough common foreign policy apparatus ; for example france / italy / germany uniting together on foreign policy . 
  * for latin america to industrialize , develop and become a `` third pillar of western values '' ( other 2 pillars are north america and europe ), 
  i 'm so sick of this populiste bullshit . 
  the youth unemployment rate in spain is a whopping 57 % , in italy it 's 40 % and in france it 's 25 % ( which seems good in comparison to others , but it is shit ) with the numbers , how can you possibly hate something that will bring so much economic growth ? 
  will some things be crappy ? 
  yes . 
  but you know what will be worse ? 
  * these youth unemployment figures sticking around after the `` baby-boomers '' retire *, 
   the united states is the only democratic world power , and it faces rivals like china and russia , which have few scruples when deploying their intelligence agencies . 
  yea , we ( europe ) needs to ascend to world power asap . 
  how can we expect the usa to play fair when we are n't even in the game ? 
   `` the germans are completely obsessed with merkel 's mobile phone , but they do n't see the big picture , '' says smith . 
  * wake the fuck up , germany *, 
   joke ... 
  in germany * ha *, 
  jesus man , he 's making a point . 
  yea , but it needs to incorporate south african british whites and south african indians / asians . 
  if it 's really about finding refuge from tyranny and sheltering from racism ; then it should try to incorporate other south african minority cultural groups . 
   lazy you do n't know shit about ukrainians, 
  you 're a dumb fuck ... are you aware of the concept of `` investment '' ? 
  ukraine is poor now but there is tremendous potential value ... 
  they have a hard working , highly educated , young population ; they have an immensely fertile * chernozem * steppe and they have a long history of being integrated into europe society . 
  tl ; dr * ukraine 2014 = $ $ * but * ukraine 2024 = $ $ $ $ *, 
  21st century germans seem to have an interesting view of sovereignty - [ the king of germany 2013 ] ( http://www.2tout2rien.fr/peter-fitzek-roi-auto-proclame-du-royaume-dallemagne/ ), 
  right now , north america and europe are the worlds dominant economic powers . 
  if we create a set of international trade regulations now we can ensure that they do not disadvantage us or our allies . 
  we can also ensure that environmental , humanitarian , technological and artistic trade is justly regulated . 
  if we design a legal framework for international trade , it will become global precedent ( as other non-signatory countries will try to conform to our regulations to access our gigantic market ) . 
  if we do ** not ** set the precedents for international trade now , or in the near future , then we will never be able to ensure a proper body of regulations because the brunt of global economic power will have shifted away from us and towards china . 
  if that happens , then it is ** us ** who will have to conform to chinese rules and regulations and not the other way around . 
  * do you understand ? 
  yea i get it , but if that 's the sacrifice we have to take to bring about a multi-polar world order , so be it . 
  friend , i just ask you to look at the big picture for just a moment ... 
  maybe 10 years , but in 50 years you will say `` thank god north america and europe harmonized their economies back in 2015 , otherwise europe , with it 's shrinking population , would be bullied by the china , india , and russia ( via energy ) . 
  and we would n't have our ttip treaty partners mexico & canada to help us counter us influence . '', 
  * china aka zhongguo aka the middle kingdom . 
  * : the chinese have believed since antiquity that the world revolves around china , and that all other nations and people are de facto vassals / tributaries of china . 
  ** from ancient times up until the opium wars , entering into the tribute system was a requirement for foreign countries wishing to enter into trading relations with china . 
  ** [ as the middle kingdom reasserts it 's former power , it will also seek to reassert sino-centrism . 
  no , russia looks east because it 's authoritarian kleptocratic overlords would lose their iron grip on power if they allowed western values to take root . 
  dumb . 
  some of those migrants are crossing the mediterranean to get to ch & no too , so it 's their problem too, 
  this is madness , we all need to do so much more . 
  honestly , every wealthy country needs to join this effort : from finland to spain ( although the less wealthy countries who have a * emigrant * problem rather than a * immigrant * problem should n't be forced to pay ... 
  but non-eu 's ch and no should ), 
  well yea , because we are the engines of social progress and meaningful advancement , if you oppose us ; you oppose progress . 
  i do n't mean to be politically incorrect , but the westerner of the 21st century is ** in general ** more compassionate , less violent , less corrupt , more productive , generates more technological advances ( especially non-military tech advances ) , cares more about the environment , cares more about the fate of humanity and etc. 
  and please , remember that i said ** in general ** , because there are crazy sociopaths and crooks in every culture . 
  just compare the most progressive russian region saint petersburg ( i 'm guessing ) and compare it to the us 's most progressive region : vermont . 
  there 's no contest , in fact st. petersburg is probably not even as progressive as some other random us state , maybe wyoming or whatever now , look at shanghai vs sweden ... how about mumbai vs munich ... you say it 's not fair to compare different wealth brackets ? 
  okay , how about dubai vs uruguay or brunei vs portugal ... no matter what western cultures are more forward-looking and more compassionate . 
  well all i 'm saying is that you russians should align with * us * and not the chinese . 
  but ... 
  they have those too, 
  shhh it tricks the brown people into thinking we have more clay than them , 
  go lookup what happened to the americans in korea . 
  tl ; dr they liberated the whole korean peninsula , then got pushed back by the chinese ... not because he chinese actually defeated them in battle but because the americans ran out of ammunition . 
  un / us troops would keep firing and firing , mowing down waves of chinese and no matter what more chinese would appear . 
  if the chinese choose to take siberia , they will pour over the border like a human tsunami . 
  the chinese can only be defeated by a technologically superior maritime power who is 1 ) attacking china from the sea and 2 ) does not share a land border with china . 
   you think the us and nato will just let it get all the land ... serious opposition from the west . 
  not if `` they '' manage to drive a wedge between us ( western powers and allies ) . 
  * divide et impera * has long been the aim of our enemies / rivals . 
  together , europe , north america , australia , and japan ( and hopefully one day latin america ) are invincible . 
  there are serious elements within china , russia , india , arabia , persia , and more who would love to see our military alliance fall apart so they can come tear us apart individually . 
  hey , i thought it was trying to refer to the colour of a latt\u00e9 idk ... a mu ** latto ** / mu ** latt\u00e9 ** ... coffee and cream, 
  no , he did n't bring it up because it 's rather odd for a non-arab , non-african french person to be anything but secular , unless you 're a little kid , raising a little kid ( aka pretending to be faithful until your kid stops being cute ) or an old person . 
  it 's not odd of you believe in a spiritual force or god , but it 's quite uncommon to devoutly practice i.e. 
  actually go to mass and such . 
  typical french reaction [ when someone tells you they go to catholic mass / confession ] ( http://collegetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/8a328a9db6be02d4_chandler-bing-really-reaction-gif.xxxlarge.gif ), 
  yea , that 's because we have so many muslims in france now . 
  i 'm not being racist , it 's the truth . 
  if you do n't believe me , go look up who the perpetrators of anti-semitic acts are . 
  interesting ... 
  here 's the thing : you 're analysis is coming from a completely different paradigm . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , but i just do n't think we see history as the same way ... for example , was britain a truly developed democracy in the modern sense ? 
  no , you are right on this . 
  was the british constitutional parliamentary system completely revolutionary and the precursor for the modern democracy ? 
  yes . 
  is it appropriate to call it democracy ? 
  yes . 
  what was that cute phrase the russians have for democracy ?
