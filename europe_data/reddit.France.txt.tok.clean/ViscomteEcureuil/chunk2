  terrorists and jihadists love this stuff . 
  google `` siege of vienna '' that occurred on september 11 , 1683 . 
  vienna is symbolic for muslims ,, 
  it is a true statement though . 
  this is the most moral and humane choice . 
  if they know they will likely die en route , then they will not try to make the trip . 
  there a lot of problems in this world , it 's good to keep a good defense . 
  yes , just put your head back in the sand . 
  or the vietnamese . 
  or , the best immigrants ever , the filipinos . 
  sweden 's looking a lot less impressive these days . 
  hat website seems extremely unprofessional and i do n't trust it . 
  you 're a lunatic, 
  ... yup i see no comment . 
  you assumed something based on his ethnicity . 
  that 's racism . 
  your comment was legitimately racist . 
  you assumed that , because he was serbian , that he * must * be a muslim hater ? 
  as if * all * serbians are muslim haters . 
  who said anything about a grouping and entire minority group ? 
  are you talking about a minority muslim groups ? 
  or the minority of islamist extremists in those muslim groups ? 
  because this site deals with the latter not the former . 
  what is spcl and why should its authority be recognized by anyone ? 
  `` run by blogger robert spencer , it has been described as one of the main homes of the counterjihad movement on the internet . '', 
  i took out the bullshit adjectives . 
  why is the bloggers catholicism called into the situation ? 
  why is it immediately labeled as right-wing , as if counterjihad is a right-wing stance ? 
   extreme right i 'm centre-left and i sensed nothing that reminded me of real far right wingers, 
  smart people : check out / r/europeans, 
  delete this and post it with a different less fucking retarded username . 
  bullshit user name , not bullshit source, 
  oh , well yea . 
  i guess trouble is inevitable whenever you undertake any big task, 
  go to canada , work on the oilfields ... thats really all i can say . 
  default for europeans, 
  thats a complete misreading of history . 
  trouble is inevitable when you try to use military force to unite europe . 
  what we are doing with the european union has never been done before on such a grand scale . 
  everyone surround china wants you to stay . 
  oh yea , but that 's not politically feasible yet . 
  and you guys will have to stay in east asia ( japan and south korea , south china sea ), 
   just as it was before that reality my god , do you really believe this ? 
  yes it is , you do n't realize it but there is actually a very , very strong natural tendency for disorder in this world and the united states military is the the keystone to upholding it 's order . 
  i know places in africa that would erupt into ethnic or religious violence ( the historical normal ) without the us military presence supporting the french military presence . 
  it does involve you , if any of that stuff happened there would be a world wide economic collapse . 
  do n't say that , it 's psychologically unhealthy to say things like that . 
  quite right , the house of saud falls and theres a huge civil war in saudi arabia that would probably spread to jordan and destroy its fragile state , iran gains total control over the straits of hormuz giving it tremendous leverage over energy hungry states ( specifically china and india ) . 
  theres gon na be a scramble for influence in the hejaz and the eastern oil rich part of saudi arabia . 
  but yea the whole region would pretty much explode into bloody conflict , and we 'd probably holocaust ii as another 6 million jews are butchered . 
  christians would get genocided a bit too , as well as any minority pagan religious communities . 
  thats the most likely scenario , to be honest . 
  could this possibly be to send a message to turkey ? 
  has n't it been boating around greek cypriot waters without permission ? 
   and as soon as someone brings up the us commenting on france 's war ship deal all hell breaks loose from french users saying the us needs to mind its business . 
  okay ... 
  pretty sure there were ** a ton ** of french users who were decrying that deal as outrageous . 
   illarionov is the same for me as zhirinovskii same as nemtsov same as yavlinskii thank you !, 
  this article really did spook me  goes in line with seeing moscowtimes as a source = 99 % of russia is horrible and we are doomed , abandon all hope and so on . 
  after a certain amount of time you just stop caring and ignore the outlet right away . 
  you should appreciate the moscow times , because it 's gives us russophiles in the west hope and that hope tells us that russia is still worth loving . 
  every empire you just mentioned were glorious , mighty and lasted for centuries . 
  they did collapse , because all great empires do . 
  yes , it is actually scary . 
  imperialism on the european continent spurns conflicts of apocalyptic proportions we western europeans learned that after the world wars , this russian imperialism will be a great burden to all of us , especially the people under moscow 's yoke . 
  russia + ukraine = superpower history has shown this to be true, 
  when i read there was a 15,000 year old bone with a swastika on it my jaw dropped and my immediate reaction was `` oh my god , it 's * that * old ?!, 
  it ** must ** be reclaimed '' views on the swastika = changed, 
   protect its arctic territories no , it 's to fuck with other countries arctic territories, 
  my god , barrack obama why are you being so dovish with putin ? 
  if russia controls ukraine then putin 's russia becomes a superpower, 
  that 's probably because of the migrants, 
  or it 's trying to put melilla on the map as a tourist spot, 
  imagine if royal dutch shell was paid $ 49 billion by the dutch government . 
  people would probably riot . 
  because of entrepreneurship and innovation, 
  i have this crazy thought that erdogan wants to revive the ottoman empire and the putin wants to revive the russian empire and that they are both actively doing this right now . 
  i 'm not saying i believe this 100 % , but i ca n't stop thinking about it . 
   you are awfully reliant on the concept of race sorry , i 'm just so used to being told that europeans are the worst and that everything wrong in the world is our fault, 
  if we did that , then every society on earth would be butt-fingering themselves . 
  the zulu massacred and subjugated bantu people 's the israelites exterminated the midianites the arabs slaughtered and subjugated the christians of the middle east and north africa the anasazi exterminated the hopi ( southwest us tribes ) the aztecs slaughtered people in other mexica city-states the mongols . 
  the fucking mongols . 
  i could go on and on ... 
  yes it does . 
  if you have grown up immersed in a european culture or a diaspora culture , then the entire way you view reality has been shaped by that legacy . 
  culture has a tremendous influence on psychological development . 
  yep , the millennia upon millennia of shared history * and pre-history * , artistic exchange of the highest caliber , scientific achievement and discovery mean absolutely nothing ... ... ... . . 
  he 's be sarcastic , people . 
  agreed  that they worked as hard as you did but it did n't have the same results . 
  this is true for the common man , but it is not true for the upper-middle classes . 
  in the west the upper and upper middle class is made mostly of business owners , entrepreneurs , doctors , lawyers etc who work their assess off . 
  over in those countries , the ruling classes do n't do shit but steal from the lower classes, 
  lulz, 
  honestly , fuck you . 
  i 'm generally not so blunt but you really deserve it . 
  did japan not qe ? 
  i could be mistaken on that but i thought abe did that as a part of abenomics, 
  true statement !, 
  they are also peos, 
  90 % + european ( south and north ),
