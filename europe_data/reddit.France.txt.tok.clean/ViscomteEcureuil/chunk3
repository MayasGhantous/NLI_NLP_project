  you 're definitely wrong because i have been to several latin american countries and when they learned i was french people would often start a talk about europe and how they really wanted to see spain and france . 
  also , they literally call themselves `` latinos '', 
  oh i see you did mean romanians . 
  i was just so confused because i thought filthy begger actually meant filthy beggar and not hard-working fellow european . 
   romanians you mean roma , romanians are a latin people descended from the ancient romans and wallachians . 
  roma are a traveling people who came to europe from india around 1600 ad, 
  also worked for the united states , australia , canada , and japan . 
  note that european does not apply to latin americans / argentineans , canadians , australians , afrikaners , israelis and americans however , these people do have a special status with europe and their connection can not be disputed . 
  they should think of themselves as persons of european origin ( peo ) though and should not be denied the right to claim their heritage . 
   who is this money going to come from , and what is in it for them ? 
  after 2008 crisis , president obama announced a stimulus package of some $ 800 billion , to get this sum they simply printed more dollars . 
  it 's called ` quantitative easing ' europe could simply print more euros , it would generate jobs and battle our deflation ogre too . 
  maybe that 's how , i 'm not positive on that though . 
  or by printing more euros ... 
  i was talking about the millions who died in the bloodlands during wwii, 
  yea he heavily censored the media so he was portrayed well and his opponents not . 
  he also rigged the whole system to benefit himself politically . 
  please do n't , he is a good historian and a good man . 
  do n't defame him for you political goals , to do so is an insult to the dead . 
  yea have companies move in actually is good . 
  it was because his anger and disgust was so raw that i thought he must have had some real life experience, 
  that was the wrong doc . 
  please watch the correct one . 
  i 'm not talking about one event , i 'm talking about an organized movement . 
  the governments for sure do not want another dictatorship in europe , of that i am certain . 
  that 's not true , victor orban is the leader of an eu country and he has us all concerned . 
  viktor yanukovych was pro-eu until putin told him to stop . 
  it 's not that europeans or even european governments are okay with dictatorship in serbia it 's that there are a shit ton of crazy , terrible things happening in this world like islamic state and russian aggression and i think there is a real social desire to ** not ** interfere in serbian affairs because we had done so in the past and the serbs did n't appreciate it . 
  see , when you have an actual democracy ; organized movements with a reasonable , well researched cause really do get things done . 
  look at nuclear power in germany and look at the scottish independence referendum . 
  you know as well as i do that that is not true, 
  please watch this documentary it will tell you all about belarus and its current political reality . 
  it 's also really freaking good . 
  europe 's last dictator - http://vimeo.com/38684197 edit : here is the documentary i 'm talking about , the other one was a google fuck up by me, 
   shithole do n't say that , its a beautiful country with a rich history . 
  it 's more like one of those old time psychiatric hospitals where the patients have no rights and are constantly being manhandled ... except of course that no one is crazy, 
  that is one vital part of serfdom . 
  this is another key component . 
  this new law means that unemployed people in cities and elsewhere can be taken to work on farms or wherever . 
  one law keeps them in serfdom , the other law brings new blood into serfdom . 
  i 'm extremely disappointed that you really believe that . 
  i have always been a russophile , and have believed that although the kremlin is barbaric , the russians are not : they are civilized europeans with a intricate and beautiful culture ; but it seems like many russians on reddit actually support the kremlin . 
  any country can spin history to make them look like the victim . 
  we french could be decrying the british for thwarting our empire , the germans for fighting us , and the americans for encouraging the break up of our empire . 
  but we do n't , at least not on the scale that you all do . 
  and why do we not ? 
  because we have realized that working together and having a civil discourse about our mutual histories is far , far more beneficial . 
  this is serfdom . 
  i 'm not gon na lie , i always get a little bit hyped up with pride whenever i think about the roman empire and definitely feel a connection to fellow inheritors of the latin culture, 
  armenia is still aligned with russia, 
  it 's citizens want to be spanish . 
  i 'm going to take a guess and say that you are of pakistani or indian origin and have some real life experience with forced marriages ? 
   there 's a difference between being ruled over/subjugated and being discriminated against at every level of society . 
  uhhh ... romanians * were * discriminated against at every level of ottoman society for being christians and refusing to turkify  i love how many europeans are so quick to decry racism and discrimination until the roma are mentioned . 
  the reason for this is that roma , many roma , refuse to integrate and have refused to integrate for centuries . 
  the programs are there , if they want to settle down and join society the door is wide open for them, 
  it is grammatically incorrect though , definitely not the queen 's english, 
  it 's black american english , double negative work sometimes to add emphasis . 
  because then it would have been an act of madness ( as in psychosis ) and not an act carrying out traditional customs . 
  if you heard about a ethnic englishman slitting his fianc\u00e9es throat , you can better bet it 's because he went bat shit psychotic . 
  and yes , that does change the moral severity of the crime . 
   like shit and exclude them from normal society for centuries , this applies to romanians as well , asshole . 
  romanians , mainstream romanians , were dragged through the mud for centuries by the turks . 
  you know nothing of eastern european or balkan history , if you did you would know the burning hell those societies have been through . 
  not every country is like the united states , france , the uk , germany etc etc. 
  where the majority were well off and but minority groups were excluded . 
  there are countries were * the entire population * was oppressed , romania is one of these . 
   what the fu what the * fudge * . 
  victor orb\u00e1n is trying to turn hungary into a belarus . 
  we , as fellow europeans , ** can not ** let this happen . 
  if the situation in hungary degrades and becomes too repressive and authoritarian , i would want that to become france 's # 1 foreign policy priority . 
  oh yea had no effect in ukraine at all ... ... 
  sept , huit , neuf a pleasant surprise , gods honest truth ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   ukip leader nigel farage commented : `` to paraphrase mark twain ` rumours of our death have been greatly exaggerated . ', 
  the eurosceptics are now back with a bang , indeed we have never been away . 
  `` last week we were done over by the feds , [ european federalists ] but today the efdd group is alive obviously having friends in the very highest places . 
  in wireless terms ... the radio signal was weak for a few days but normal transmission has now been resumed . 
  `` european parliament president schulz 's part in trying to shut us down last week was contemptible . 
  it was manipulative backroom politics of the worst kind . 
  but in his eagerness to silence the eurosceptic voice he acted prematurely . 
  `` eu federalists will be sitting in a corner somewhere slowly rocking muttering the words ` please make the eurosceptics go away ' over and over . 
  we will now make the eu 's centralising fanatics regret their short-lived bout of hubris . '', 
  the man is a poet , you have to admit . 
  do n't ruin it . 
  this will be a big tourist draw once romania becomes a full fledged oecd nation . 
  / r/downtonabbey, 
   gi ' what sort of dialect madness is this ? 
   and that is relevant , how ? 
  because that 's a fucking crazy law ... how could the supreme leader allow such madness ? 
  it 's just butt-sex between 2 dudes , may be icky to some but jesus christ to kill people for that is downright murder , completely evil . 
   the tiny country that actively occupies and colonizes another nation . 
  and is armed with 80 or more nukes ? 
  please ... 
  i 'm not going to even get into this because the situation is complex . 
  but both sides have legitimate grievances . 
  the state of israel has a right exist and so does palestine, 
  it was actually a lot more complicated than that . 
  the shah was never installed because the shah never left !, 
  he was still the shah when new government was elected ( by an electorate of upper-middle class persian muslim males only ) . 
  it 's like how the queen of england is queen even if parliament changes .
