   iran is surrounded by extremist countries yes , and that is really fucking sad . 
   constantly threatened by israel and the us threatened is not the right word . 
  and leave little tiny israel out of this . 
   iran has shown to be a rational state pretty sure homosexuals are still executed in iran, 
   colonize us yea that 's was the game in those days . 
  but british colonial rule would have been an improvement for most persians . 
  because most persians can pass as white . 
   steal our oil no there was a negotiated oil contract . 
  it was the guy who got overthrown who stole the oil ; actually . 
  british firms had invested vast amounts of resources developing iranian oil with technology and expertise that iran lacked . 
  they had an oil contract with iran , invested a shit ton of money , and then got the rug pulled out from under them . 
   destabilized the region the region has always been destabilized . 
  that 's because iran is being weird trying to get nuclear weapons . 
  do you have any idea how frightening the thought of a muslim extremist cleric like the ayatollah getting nuclear weapons is ? 
  also if you left israel in peace and quit that hezbollah nonsense . 
  that 's just how europeans played the great game of world domination . 
  it 's actually a big improvement over the previous arrangement of `` kill everyone who threatens our interests . '', 
  for us it 's more like `` incessantly poke everyone ( even after a poke wound opens up , and still keeping poking after the open poke wound becomes putrid ) who threatens our interests '', 
  muahahahaha i believe we played an equal part in said coup but we never get blamed !, 
  well i 've been to sicily twice and i got scammed both times . 
  [ voil\u00e0 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ltnwor3.jpg ) i love armenia , poland , ukraine and the baltics because they are little lions fucking hate saudi arabia and the russian government in moscow . 
  woah that is seriously unfair . 
  the jewish state began in earnest on purchased land , and the entire muslim world went ballistic and pledged to destroy israel . 
  if israel was n't a tough state , we would seen have seen the streets of tel aviv and jerusalem awash with innocent blood . 
  you saw what sick things they did to the yazidis and assyrian christians , they would do the same to jews . 
   asshole nah , i just think he sensitive because everyone shits on his country for defending itself ... jews have not had very pleasant experiences with xenophobia, 
  maybe he works in the * londongrad * financial industry, 
  omg yeah i fucking hate saudi arabia . 
  you have good taste, 
  muslim extremism is taken very very seriously in france as well . 
  when i say there are integration problems , what i meant was that there are far too many hardcore muslim fanatics that are refusing to embrace the values of a secular democratic state, 
   state energy company naftogaz is unable to pay its arrears partly ** because of debts created by consumers in the eastern donetsk and luhansk regions **, 
  it 's not fair for italy to do it because it 's not fair for france to do it . 
  al jazeera seems so legit but i ca n't bring myself to trust it 's advice due to the fact that it 's a qatari government outlet . 
  the qatar , the country whose government worked some 700 workers to death in preparing for the world cup . 
  idk i do agree with the main premise of the article somewhat . 
  ** as long as our collective foreign policy apparatus is strong , prompt and effective **,

  i bet 90 % of catholics do eats pasta though, 
  and you would be correct . 
  i suppose so . 
  i 'm wondering if there will be a zionist - neonazi alliance , though . 
  would make interesting allies . 
  it does though . 
  we europeans have been stung so harshly by right wing extremists ( wwii ) that we immediately take a stance against them . 
  and we do this rightly so 99.9 % of the time , but not this time . 
  both should ask about nato . 
  i think it would be interesting if there were surveys for western europeans , greco-roman / mediterranean europeans , nordic europeans , eastern europeans , balkan europeans and british europeans too . 
  what do you think about the united states ? 
  please note whether you are british .

  please note whether you are iberian . 
  from a secular standpoint , how important is europe 's christian heritage ? 
  please note whether you are a practicing christian , practicing muslim , practicing jew or functionally secular . 
  ** what do you think of european pre-history ? 
  how important is our common pre-historic heritage to your identity as a european ? 
  ** it 2100 and europeans see their european nationality as a core part of their being , does this disturb you or inspire you ? 
  * die \u00c4pfelfaschisten * are a problem too, 
  i wish the pc-nazis would realize that this kind of crap gives fuel to the very thing they are trying to prevent . 
   nsa saboteurs in china good . 
  china tries to steal western tech at every turn , taking steps to curb their intrusions are a good idea in my book . 
  well as a conscious being i have decided that god is the physical universe * therefore * god is the physical universe . 
   believing its not so much believing but rather assuming that jesus was an enlightened human like buddha . 
  i mean ; look at the beatitudes . 
  those are ridiculously advanced and profound . 
   nab lol nab `` 17 ` do not suppose that i came to throw down the law or the prophets -- i did not come to throw down , but to fulfill ; '' - youngs literal tranlastion `` 17m\u0113 nomis\u0113te hoti \u0113lthon katalusai ton nomon \u0113 tous proph\u0113tas ; ouk \u0113lthon katalusai alla pl\u0113r\u014dsai ; '' - original greek of above ** katalusai = / = destroy ** it means leave unused . 
  he saying that he is not establishing a new religion just a continuation of judaism . 
  remember that matthew was written to bring non hellenic jews into the way ( side note , both early christianity and early buddhism were called ` the way ' ) and `` 20 ` for i say to you , that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and pharisees , ye may not enter to the reign of the heavens . '', 
  ** if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and pharisees , ye may not enter ** * my interpretations ; * if your christian faith is not greater than that of the scribes or people obsessed with the scripture , then you wo n't become enlightened the word for ** `` righteousness , '' dikaiosun\u0113 , ** is one of the most significant words in the new testament ; it means much more than simply `` righteousness . '' it is a second-stage development in the greek language in that it comes from two older words . 
  ** herodotus first coined dikaiosun\u0113 ** as a legal term , meaning `` the thinking of a judge in allotting to each one what is due him , '' in other words , good , clear , objective thinking . 
  herodotus coined the term , therefore herodotus ' definition * must * be used . 
  edit : by the way , i 'm only a christian because i say the the physical universe is god . 
  so i know the whole thing . 
  old testament , cult of yahweh crap . 
  know one knows what christian belief really is . 
  we only have very few directly attributed quotes to jesus . 
  well we used to murder nazis a lot in fact we murdered millions of them . 
  hate to break it but chrisitianity can be pretty neat when properly followed . 
  my christian belief : * the universe is god . 
  like the actual physical universe is god . 
  * the kingdom of heaven is here , right now , and those who are able to realize this are the ones who realize the amazing brilliance of science , nature , other beings and are truly compassionate * jesus was a sage who realized the true nature of god ( that god is the universe ) and that god is love . 
  * god is love * jesus hooked himself onto the cult of yahweh to inject his message that god is love into a very violent religion . 
  * ** jesus died to for us so we could enter the kingdom of heaven ** aka realize that god is love and that the kingdom of heaven is the physical universe . 
  * jesus used his crucifixion as a vehicle to announce his message , he knew his death would be a like a giant megaphone proclaiming his message . 
  * christianity and buddhism are actually the same religion ** there is nothing in the original scripture that refutes anything i said , it 's all legit ** edit : go read some heretical gospels from the 1st century . 
  also watch this doc on [ buddhas life . ] ( http://youtu.be/lifxlfsbyow ) . 
  then realize that holy shit first century christian heretics were fucking buddhists and they did n't even know it . 
  edit2 : its hard to describe what i believe i geuss , but i could describe it i 'm sure everyone would agree . 
  just play with the thoughts , just meditate on my comments a bit . 
  read the new testament assuming that the kingdom of heaven is the physical universe around us ( and we are too caught up in our little reality to recognize this ) and assuming that god is the physical universe . 
  combine your perception of the spiritual world with the physical world ( they are the same world ), 
  ah yes gerherd shroeder aka * `` el berlusconi del norte '' *, 
  see he was a scholarly statesmen and lawyer for much of his life ; he was even against the death penalty at one point !, 
  we got kinda depressed after everyone united against us during the napoleonic wars ... like a middle aged american man who was laid of from his career , we just lost our virility for a quick sec, 
  yes it was , i took op at her word without thinking . 
  my mind only registered its mandate status :-), 
  he was rational for the most part , he has also been vilified a bit too much .
