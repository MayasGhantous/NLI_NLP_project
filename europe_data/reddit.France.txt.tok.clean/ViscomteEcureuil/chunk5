  but yes , he did go a little crazy as time went on ... all those who gain such power do ( except ** certain ** individuals who were born and raised to wield absolute power ), 
  no these were not converts , they were french by nationality . 
  the jihadis were not ethnic french but they most certainly absorbed french traits . 
  these men speak french as their native language and arabic as their second . 
  also , versailles shows the passion but does also show the rationality , king louis xiv knew that the grandeur would give him impressive ` soft ' power with regards to other european monarchs . 
  syria was not created to be governed by france , it was created with the independence in mind . 
  so the normal french modal of colonial governance was not applied . 
  edit : iraq was the british mandate , but you may have been thinking of syria, 
  it 's probably the because they grew up well nourished by our benefits system , and are properly literate because of our education system . 
  they 've probably absorbed certain french / western psychological traits such as the spirit of the explorer / ` conquistador ' and the rejection of petty superstition in favor of sound reason . 
  also , did anybody else think about how we french also dominated the crusades and the crusader states via the templars , when they read this quote ? 
  please be aware he 's not talking about all muslims in france , he 's talking about a specific type of french muslims . 
  they are intense and they consider christian , secular and jewish french people to be unclean , unworthy and little more than dirt . 
  no he 's saying that they know that we can get really intense and dominate things when we really get our hearts into it , because our culture breeds passion and rational competency . 
  think of the crusades , versailles , the revolution , and the french brand of colonialism . 
  the templars , louis xiv , robespierre , napoleon and our intense , comprehensive style of colonial governance . 
  hi there . 
  please check out this website . 
  http://www.eupedia.com it 's an official eu initiative , so you know it 's legit, 
  omg i hope that .1 % is spent on a cavalry of icelandic pony mounted huldufolk . . that would be ** so ** adorable, 
  it 's not breaking international law if security council members act together ( without protest by another security council member ) to maintain global security . 
  dang it , i came here to say this !!, 
  i had a big fuss all nice and planned out, 
  no , because the un security council has no jurisdiction over cases of gang-rape . 
  that is something for local and national governments to deal with . 
  it 's totally legal because we ( fr.uk.us ) said it is and china and russia have not protested . 
  no one said anything about police state laws , we 're talking about air strikes . 
  besides the police is your country can already surveil with great liberty . 
  [ views on honor killings for those who dishonor the family ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nbqo5g6.jpg ) 40 % of russian muslims say it is justified 20-40 % of central asian muslims believe it is justified 20 - ** 50 % ** of southeast asian muslims believe it is justified ** 70-80 % ** of south asian muslims believe it is justified ** 70 % + ** of mideastern muslims believe it is justified . 
  [ support for suicide bombings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6pfogut.jpg ) ( please read the explanation ) and also , this survey was taken by a very progressive organization, 
  how about we stop acting like daesh ( islamic state ) and muslim terrorism is n't a threat . 
  it ** is ** a threat . 
  the rise of militant salafism in our time is equivalent to the rise of fascism in our grandparents time . 
   when one of their family members was blown up , which over half a million was , they pushed for the ability to fight back . 
  nope . 
  those people just want the fighting to be done and they are thankful for it to be over now . 
   taliban  hamas personally , i would rather die and burn in hell than join those groups . 
  even if their enemies burned my family alive . 
  those young men knew full well what those organizations stood for and what they were capable of when they joined . 
  they consciously chose to follow an immoral path . 
  stop victimizing the predators . 
   taliban  hamas, 
  in the majority of cases , this is not true . 
  yes there are some potent examples , notably the division of the ferghana valley in central asia by the russians , but this was not to exploit them economically ; it was meant to prevent the turkic central asians from uniting around a ferghana valley core and thus creating a potent geopolitical threat . 
  and the the division of malaysia , indonesia and papua new guinea . 
  but that too was done to thwart the creation of an autocratic maritime superpower . 
  you 're playing a pretend game . 
  firstly , afghan society does n't work like that , it 's not common for individuals to join the taliban ; it 's * tribal groups * that decide to join the taliban . 
  the tribes / clans are lead by patriarchs who decide whether to allow their young men to become talibs or not . 
  the tribal patriarchs now see the afghan government as a better option than the taliban because the individual tribes have more power under the current system because they have a voice in the loya jirga , a tribal assembly that is far more transparent and rule based than traditional taliban legislative bodies . 
  a tribal patriarch has the ability to loudly protest and make bold demands in this new system , while in the old system he would have had his tongue cut out on the spot if he protested too much . 
  it 's basic power dynamics, 
  wait ... the taliban is far , far weaker now than in 2001 before operations began . 
  yea but it can also be answered with `` no , but maybe '' or better yet `` not entirely so , but perhaps to some significant degree '', 
  yea but they are called legionnaires and that is a bad ass name in the eyes of the descendent societies of ancient rome ( the west and slavs ) . 
  fsa = sunni arabs , isis = sunni arabs . 
  this is a vital component to why your scenario might happen between those two groups . 
  and thus it falls upon the civilian population to kill the isis troops when they do such . 
  shia arabs , sufi mystics , assyrian christians , turkmen and kurds all want daesh ( isis ) blood . 
  also the saudis and gulf states will have to fucking turn up the propaganda to keep sunni arabs from being swayed by daesh . 
  okay then do n't torture them , just vaporize them in an air strike . 
  so , europe fucked up europe 's borders worse than anyone else 's borders . 
  look at a map of europe 100-150 years ago and then look at it today . 
  completely different . 
  yea but milk is healthy ; i think a better way to say that is to say `` you can lead a child to fresh squeezed juice made from fruits and veggies from grandmas organic garden , but it might prefer drain cleaner because it looks like grape soda . '', 
  well to be correct , iraq has huge populations of shia arabs and kurds who are the sworn enemies of daesh . 
  there are also many moderate sunni arab iraqis who detest daesh . 
  so it 's support is not overwhelming . 
  edit : but the support they get from the international sunni ummah more than makes up for it, 
  isil could defeat the alliance of sunni states . 
  huge chunks of their young male population would rather fight for the islamic caliphate rather than for their respective sykes-picot made country . 
  the only reason the sunni states stand a chance is that it 's actually the * alliance of sunni states + fr.uk.us . 
  * edit : i think a big misconception is that the islamic state is a static entity ; it is not . 
  it is like a black-hole that becomes stronger and more `` dense '' as it sucks in surrounding territory . 
  similar to all previous islamic caliphates , khanates and hordes . 
  if it were n't for western military strikes isil would have overwhelmed baghdad , iraqi kurdistan and syria . 
  even with western strikes , isil has secured a vast territory . 
  [ isil vs usa ] ( http://i.imgur.com/upq2fxn.jpg ) ( old map ) [ isil vs uk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ho23dfl.jpg ) ( old map ) [ the current territory controlled by isil as of 25 september 2014 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jkf6yv9.jpg ) and before you say `` well most of that is desert '' please consider that the desert territory provides isil with a lot of geopolitical security , it 's a giant buffer between isils core and israel on one side and a buffer between it and iran on the other . 
  furthermore , isil controls the bulk of the fertile crescents most productive farmland . 
  [ as seen here , where the brown represents the fertility of the land ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xhfdmie.jpg ) ( green represents non - or semi-agricultural vegetated areas ) . this huge geopolitical asset means that isil is able to sustain itself ; both its soldiers and the civilian population it rules over . 
  food security is hugely important . 
  it will be immensely more powerful after incorporating its neighbors ( all but turkey , iran , and israel are too weak to resist isil without western support ) . 
  the more victories isil wins the more support it garners throughout the sunni muslim world . 
  as we speak there are [ hordes of passionate jihadis from around the world flocking to isils ranks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1ukdiwq.jpg ) not only would isil gain soldiers by defeating neighboring arab states , it would also gain massive supplies of petroleum . 
  already it has [ massive oil reserves under its control ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nhcac8r.jpg ) ( also here [ is a simpler map to understand ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fmpfxpy.jpg ) . 
  this wealth helps them arm and refortify militarily , they bring in some $ 400 million dollars a day in oil revenues so far , a number that will increase without western strikes . 
  they have stated that turkey is part of their goal . 
  their state motto is `` ever remaining and * ever expanding * . '', 
  meanwhile in eastern europe ( arguably the most oppressed region in the modern age ) people are slogging it out , carving out prosperous societies with their own bare hands . 
  these eastern euros have emerged from their blood-soaked past with no oil , no diamonds , no mountains of gold ; just a bit of relatively fertile earth and look at the shiny , modern societies they so far built . 
  honestly , i wonder what eastern europe would be like if all that benefits money went to building eastern european infrastructure instead of buying ipads for refugees ? 
  it 's not so much that the immigrants are stealing the benefits it 's that the upper classes are diverting the benefits away from the struggling working class towards the refugees . 
  upper classes do n't get their communities disrupted by wave after wave of refugees ; but the working class does . 
  the upper classes think they are being saintly and generous by supporting pro-immigration measures but in reality they are putting a serious burden on the working class people . 
  i agree with you completely , on everything except the useless fucks part . 
  just think about children 's crusade bit, 
   useless fucks no no , this is not the right term to describe such people . 
  they truly believe in peace and compassion with all their hearts . 
  they represent the best of human nature . 
  however , so did the european youths of the children 's crusade ( also known as the innocents crusade ) whose noble na\u00efvet\u00e9 led them to believe that they could overwhelm the saracens with unconditional , total love .
