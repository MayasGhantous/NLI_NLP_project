  you say that only because you do n't share a border with russia, 
  there 's no fucking way . 
  they would be destroying russia itself to defend external territory ? 
  no way, 
  wait , * motorola * ... ? 
  no there would be a war but they would end it before it hit russian soil . 
  russia is not going to use nukes because of defeat outside of russian territory . 
   unrelated i 'm sorry , but how is a terrorist attack by sunni jihadis unrelated to sunni islam ? 
   you people you mean people with direct personal experience with islamic extremism who have seen horrifying public demonstrations by salafis ? 
  people who are genuinely concerned for the safety of their country ? 
  people who live in a country that is forced to have heavily armed guards placed at the most prominent national treasures because the threat of jihadi violence is so severe ? 
  people who see islamist graffiti strategically written at key points on a subway / underground route ? 
   whiterights oh shut the front door with that nonsense , this has nothing to do with race it only has to do with the failure of certain groups to integrate into mainstream society . 
  the sikhs do a wonderful job in britain , as do many other groups . 
  it 's just that * certain * groups adamantly refuse to integrate because they perceive themselves as superior and consider the rest of us infidels to be unclean , dirty and our culture unworthy of adherence . 
  also sunni islam . 
  you can also blame sunni islam . 
  we ** absolutely can ** ignore them to protect our people from this threat . 
  i ca n't believe no one said the ukrainian anthem yet . 
  its a gorgeous piece of music . 
  i get chills * every * time is listen to it . 
  i ca n't understand a single word , but i feel like i perfectly understand the message . 
  [ the ukrainian anthem - it 's a masterpiece ] ( http://youtu.be/xeqpqnx9lzq ) ( skip to :50 ), 
  more like trying to discuss the problem that is frustrating many european countries, 
  i 'm not sure why you 're so angry , [ takfirism is an actual problem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgk62_z26ti ), 
  he very specifically says that people who think ** all ** multiculturalism is good are imbeciles and he 's right . 
  im not sure you understand that the people he thinks should be excluded from europe are fascists who rely on an ideology of religious superiority instead of racial superiority, 
  give the americans the green light and they can make him `` disappear '', 
   intolerant , totalitarian , barbaric death-cult no he said it . 
  right there . 
  no he 's talking about fascist salafis, 
  yea , he 's talking about fascist , salafist extremists . 
  those are worthy of the title `` undesirable '' . 
  regardless of race, 
  he 's talking about a political / religious ideology not race . 
  he 's not playing semantics he 's being genuine . 
  he 's actual talking about a political / religious ideology not race . 
  this sanctions ordeal wo n't last that long, 
  i 'm serious and i 'm not trying to be a smartass , i 'm referring to a troubling trend that is gaining more and more support . 
  by * takfiri * definition all progressive `` istanbul '' turks are * kafir . 
  so the wahhabi * takfiri * would say you 're actually * kafir * not a true muslim ; and for that they would behead you and your children if they got the chance . 
   rather be funding secular education to be fair . 
  yes that would be ideal , but we need results and to get results we will have to compromise ( to a certain extent ), 
  fox news = the tv version of the daily mail, 
  betrayed greece by helping the persians wow , fuck that guy . 
  okay , why are vietnamese and slavic immigrants fitting in so well ? 
  stop trying to sweep this under the rug , this is a serious issue and we need to keep our thinking clear . 
  it probably happened , people do n't always report these things to the authorities because they do n't want more harassment . 
  the fact is that the * ummah * see 's israel 's war against hamas as a war against all the * ummah * , thus they assume that fighting a war against all jews is logical . 
   making laws against muslims not muslims , but salafists and the like . 
  the truth is that devout people look to the religious texts of their religion for guidance , especially when they seek out to do what they believe the will of god is in the world . 
  you 're not realizing how starkly different christ and muhammed were . 
  [ side-by-side comparison ] ( http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/jesus-muhammad.htm ) and i should note that i 'm a rather secular , progressive person too . 
  i 'm not trying to sell christianity , i 'm trying to properly inform about islam . 
  i was talking about the person whose story forms the very core of the religion , not various sects that developed over time . 
  there 's a big difference that you 're glossing over . 
  and muhammed spread islam by the sword in the near east just like cortez and pizarro spread catholicism by the sword in the americas, 
  because one religion holds it 's ideal person to be a pacifist ascetic while the other religion holds it 's ideal person to be a ruthless * conquistador * . 
  wandering around the countryside teaching shepherds and peasants about the evils of vengeance and classism is in no way the same as leading an army of desert nomads into a lifetime of violent conquest . 
  do n't compare american evangelicals with islamists . 
  it 's not the same . 
  muhammed was a psychopathic warlord while jesus was probably some kind of compassionate buddhist monk, 
  french soldiers too !, 
  this is a serious problem and we need to pay attention, 
  because your respective community of ancestral origin have built up a complex theological and philosophical tradition upon muhammeds original teachings . 
  however , once that theological tradition is no longer there in full force , then young muslims that are not properly versed in their respective theological tradition begin to adopt the original , psychotic desert-goat herder tradition . 
  this can happen for several reasons : when youths migrate and leave their elders ( the guardians of the theological tradition ) behind or when young people become apathetic to the tradition of their elders and drawn to energetic , young imams who offer an intense spiritual experience compared to the measured spiritual experience their elders could provide . 
  dae realize they might actually support using guantanamo bay and cia black sites for this crisis ? 
  i mean , i support human rights but i also support not having some 80 year old french nuns getting her head sawed off with a kitchen knife for refusing to convert ... 
  yo , that 's what cia blacksites are for, 
  the full face veil is not required by islam . 
  head scarves are okay . 
  ninja masks are not , they are a cultural dress from their former homeland and they need to assimilate . 
  modest muslim woman : ok ninja / dementor / ringwraith : not ok, 
  no thanks , not interested in having millions of ninja masked women drifting around my country like wringwraiths, 
  well , how was he supposed to know she was a qatari princess if she has that thing on her face ?? 
  when a european woman visits arabia ; she puts a little scarf on her head because thats arabian law . 
  when an arabian woman visits certain european countries ; she should not wear a face mask because thats against the laws of certain european countries . 
  simple as that . 
  * when in rome ... *, 
   25 % oil production increase in libya oh , so that 's why putin made such a fuss about western intervention in the libya civil war ... 
   setting themselves on fire sacrificing their lives , and their lives only , to bring attention to injustice . 
  if this happened pre-poroshenko , i 'd agree . 
  but president poroshenko has the unique charisma that the ukrainian people need in a commander-in-chief . 
  oh hey , is that the roller coaster that painlessly kills you ? 
  well we are a free market society , so unless there are sanctions concerning this particular activity ; then the company does have a right to take this contract . 
  and it 's definitely better than selling them war ships , which was toats fucked up ... idk , it still feels poopy to me though, 
  well i think it 's wealth would elevate it above burkina faso . 
  i 'd say it would carry the same clout as someplace like ghana . 
  i felt like scum after visiting that website . 
  simply reading the comments from various users on those ukraine stories is a great way to learn about your fellow europeans , you can really absorb certain political and cultural traits . 
  additionally , the ukraine situation is not just about ukraine and russia , but for many european it is equally relevant to their country as it is to ukraine . 
  do n't forget that it provides valuable modern military experience that a country as small as denmark would otherwise never get . 
  also , it builds trust between the danish defence establishment and the us defence establishment which results in denmark having access to all the newest , shiny military tech coming out of the states not only that , but the danish diplomats will get access to the american diplomacy network worldwide . 
  combine this with denmark 's access to european diplomacy networks and you have in little denmark a kitten that can roar . 
  so now when danish officials have to do some tough negotiations in china or vietnam or myanmar , they will be treated with more deference than a nation of ~ 5 million normally would . 
  op 's title is too broad . 
  the video , however , is not lies . 
  this video says 2 things : when the ukrainian government secures an area , services are restored ( ice cream requires refrigeration which requires electricity ) and business can resume operations and the ukrainian army is not full of fascist child-crucifiers . 
  i think the point of this is that once ukrainian forces establish control of an area , there is a good degree of returning to normalcy .
