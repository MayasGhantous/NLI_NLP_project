  yes , people that are in the combat zones are under duress , for sure , but the ukrainian army is clearly restoring order to areas they have retaken . 
  the point is : no need for russian aid ** as long as the ukrainian army is making effective progress and restoring order ** in donbas . 
  did no one here get that ? 
  did no one notice that these soldiers are not in combat , nor are they even on guard ? 
  ** they are clearly in a fully retaken , secure `` green zone '' as the americans would say . 
  ** this video is saying that once a secure `` green zone '' has been established , little general stores can restock their ice cream supplies because the ice cream manufacturer in kharkiv ( or wherever ) is confident that they can now send shipments to vendors in retaken areas without having their product / trucks / drivers being confiscated / robbed by separatists . 
  edit : also , russian propaganda has been telling people in donbas that the ukrainian army will crucify their children when they arrive . 
  this video is meant to say '' ** no , we ukrainian soldiers are not going to crucify your babies when we come , we are going to be respectful and polite to locals ** '', 
  russian propaganda : * ukrainian nazis crucifying children !, 
  * ukrainian propaganda : * luganda and donbabwe do n't need aid , they have ice cream !, 
  * in this case , the analogy `` ukrainian propaganda is to russian propaganda what the armenian genocide is to the holocaust '' is ** false ** correct analogy : * ukrainian propaganda is to russian propaganda what ` making rosa parks sit in the back of the bus because she 's african-american ' is to the holocaust * edit : * italics * are pretty, 
  so , what are you saying ? 
  that we should treat verified facts on the ground and blatant falsehoods / deceitful half-truths as equally credible ? 
  pretty sure the kurds are fighting to protect their homeland aka their women , children and culture . 
  pretty sure that 's a just cause . 
  additionally , kurdistan 's * peshmirga * are the official kurdish defense forces managed by the democratically elected kurdish government in erbil . 
  this lends them important legitimacy . 
  kurdish forces have also proven themselves to be a competent , disciplined and efficient fighting force . 
  considering that : * the nature of their cause is just * they have democratically anointed legitimacy * their competency in battle has been tested and proven i think it is entirely acceptable and ethically correct to provide material assistance to the kurdish * peshmirga * . 
  edit : plus , we must also consider the very dark nature of their foe and the grim fate the kurds would face if the * peshmirga * failed . 
  thanks for analyzing this scenario base on something that happened somewhere a thousand miles away , 20 years ago . 
  you know that sometimes being one-sided is okay , right ?? 
  like when the facts on the ground strongly indicate that the actions of one side are based on falsehoods , deceit and consistently conflict with your ethical values in a profound way . 
  you do know that not every country works like yours and mine ... the people in these areas did not elect to have an islamic state , they were ** conquered ** by an islamist state, 
  oh shit , he 's for sure a 12 year old . 
  and actually that 's pretty sophisticated thinking for a 12 yr old , so i bet he grows up to be a rather sensible citizen-voter . 
  die for mali and car but not for ukraine ... yea , i do n't buy it, 
  no , he 's wrong . 
  he is very wrong, 
   us , us , us , us oh i 'm sorry , i thought we were talking about russia and europe ...  removing government control over private business so big ( us owned ) multi-national conglomerates can come into your country and rape it 's natural resources or worker production for pennies on the pound and countries that do n't conform - like venezuela , cuba , chile , peru , uruquay , bolivia , ecuador , vietnam - that allowed government intrusion and nationalisation of land or fair wages for their workers were brutally fucked over or sanctioned into the third world but it 's ok because they were `` communist '' or `` would be communist '' and `` domino-theorys '' or `` something '' etc etc. . . you do know that its a lot less one sided than you make it sound . 
  1 . state owned companies in a lot of those countries were corrupt and inefficient as fuck . 
  2 . there were also instances of legitimate business , run by good people who invested a lot of money into said business , that were confiscated the second those businesses achieved something impressive or developed a new technology . 
  thats nothing more than theft . 
   a farcical carnival of the us trying to show strength against russia oh how surprising , you managed to find a way to paint russia as the victim and the us as the aggressor . 
  god knows it could n't be something else , since that would conflict with your worldview ( ! ), 
  yea it was a short and sweet refresher though . 
   americans paid 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for natural gas , while germans paid 9 cents . 
  russia is trying to make us weak . 
  that sort of cost difference has a big impact on the gdp growth numbers . . 
   if you dont think russia was humiliated by how the cold war ended then i dont really know what to say to you russia was not humiliated , she was freed . 
  it was the kremlin who was humiliated , and it 's their own damn fault , they preferred to tear apart the nation rather than allow gorbachev to successfully implement his reforms . 
  and i know many a russian who were not humiliated by the collapse of the ussr because they felt suffocated and persecuted by soviet authorities . 
   the `` wests '' policies actually curtail russia 's wants who is russia to you ? 
  is it the mafia government at the kremlin or is it made up of the russian people ? 
  if your answer is the mafia governments , then the policies of the civilized world curtail `` russia 's '' wants . 
  if your answer is the russian people , then you 're statement is false because the policies of western and other civilized societies sought to create a mutually beneficial relationship with russia . 
  there was talk of the transfer of technology , offers of financial resources and huge investments in russia and in the russian economy  what russia really wants and thats expansion that is what the kremlin wants . 
  which is absurd because russia is already a massive country and they have enough natural wealth to facilitate the creation of a happy , stable and healthy society . 
  take a look at canada and australia , they 've done a fantastic job at using their natural wealth to build prosperous , peaceful societies . 
   augmented mad , its in their new military doctrine that nuclear strikes are viable pretty sickening that putin and his circle are willing to slaughter that many people just to maintain their position . 
   after being humiliated by the west you answer is they should crawl to them begging for scraps . 
  * they were not humiliated by the west , they were humiliated by their own mismanagement . 
  if you sail to battle in a ship made of rotting wood and your ship sinks before you can engage the enemy , it 's your own fault . 
  * russia would not be `` begging for scraps '' they would be actively participating in a dynamic and mutually beneficial social and economic relationship . 
  i 'll just refer back to the post-war example between france and west germany : west germany was not forced to `` beg for scraps '' from france ; but rather the french and german leadership crafted a robust partnership that lead to tremendous economic and social gains for both members . 
   and everything is total bullshit . 
  did you read that quote , because that 's the truest , most important thing to take away from this article . 
  russian propaganda is a revolting insult to any civilized society , if individuals wish to seek out russian propaganda for their own intellectual curiosity ; then all power to them . 
  but to expose the general public , most of whom will take every word the talking heads on tv say as pure truth , is socially irresponsible . 
  it can lead to terrible conflict . 
  remember the run-up to the iraq war when certain american news networks constantly hyped up the iraqi threat , generating a false sense of fear that terrified americans and made it easier for bush to sell his war ? 
  do you not think that was immoral ? 
  oh yea , because a huge islamic caliphate in north africa is exactly what the world needs now gosh , would n't it be ** super swell ** if we let that happen and the islamic state of north africa could meld with the islamic state of iraq and syria to create one huge , glorious islamic supercaliphate !!!?? 
  that would be ** so ** great for europe !, 
   also to play devils advocate here russia has lost its buffer  how would you feel if your old enemies then got control of your main oil lines to them and a position only 250 miles from your capital in one swoop . 
  oh gee , idk how i would feel if my capital city was less than 200 miles from our old enemies ... . huh , i guess if that were the case , then i 'd have to find some way to create a close , mutually beneficial economic and political union with my former enemy & amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; put all my heart and soul in creating a strong and enduring friendship with my former enemy ... idk , maybe that 's just me though . 
  edit : also , do you have any idea how outrageous it is to even suggest that russia has a right to turn the 45 million strong ukrainian nation into a buffer ? 
  you do know that the last time ukraine became russia 's buffer , the russians torched every farm , bridge , factory , field of crops , slaughtered every livestock possible , demolished every road and turned all of ukraine into a scorched wasteland ** solely ** to improve its value as a buffer ? 
   shithole hahahahahaha are you retarded ?? 
  do you have any idea how much better life in spain is than in the vast majority of countries in the world ?? 
   gay guys in cloud atlas that reminds of another social phenomena related to `` the ellen degeneres effect '' . 
  this related phenomena occurs as soon as straight women begin to see gay guys as cute , adorable teddy bears . 
  once straight women see gay men in this way , their maternal instincts kick in and it also causes a surge in respect for gays . 
  i think something similar to the `` straight-women-finding-gay-guys-adorable phenomena '' is the `` straight-guys-feeling-protective-of-gay-guys-they-know effect '' i think that when straight men become friends with gay guys , they instinctually feel protective of them ; this instinct originally makes men instinctually feel protective of female friends but manifests itself towards gay guy friends too . 
   objective and honest idealists are too rare it 's not that they 're so rare , it 's just that they need to both pragmatic / realist and idealist think gandhi : * i want a peaceful world , but i must go about making the world peaceful in a carefully thought out , pragmatic manner *, 
   note : afaik quickly growing food prices are the main trigger behind `` arabian spring '' . 
  oh shit , you 're right . 
  the whole reason why things exploded in egypt was because the prices of a loaf of bread rose by like a few cents or something ... * hyperbolique metaphor * : monday : loaf of bread costs 25 cents ; mubarak in power tuesday : loaf of bread costs 75 cents ; revolution in tahrir square, 
   but our society still maintains many negative stereotypes ( mainly , gays = = pedophiles ) that were n't prevalent in western countries even 20 years ago . 
  honestly , western countries held that stuff to be true too . 
  i think britain used to force gays to be chemically castrated and to be placed in mental facilities until the 1980 's in the us , gay sex was illegal in many states until a supreme court decision in 2000-something ruled that those bans were unconstitutional . 
  i 'm telling you man , attitudes with this issue can radically change edit : here 's my hypothesis : respect for gays meets heavy resistance at first - but as long as the government allows freedom of expression , people begin to see gays as harmless . 
  but even this changing of hearts and minds is slow to take root . 
  then at some point , i suppose it 's some sort of critical tipping point , a flood of respect for gays overtakes a society - i believe this happens as soon as gays feel generally safe to come out . 
  at that point everyone will have at least one gay cousin , brother , sister , uncle , childhood friend or co-worker who is gay . 
  psychological studies have proven that once someone meets and socializes with a gay person , their attitudes towards gays radically change 180 \u00b0 - i have heard that this is called `` the ellen degeneres effect '' ( after the lovable [ american comedian ellen degeneres ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lj2x1bb.jpg ) , who came out as a lesbian after she became america 's sweetheart as a tv star . ), 
  americans were like `` oh ellen degeneres is a lesbian ?? 
  but ellen is a wonderful angel , if she 's a lesbian then that means that lesbians can be awesome , wonderful people too ! '', 
   do you think the eu can ever step in ? 
  no no , not necessary . 
  respect for gays needs to be something that a society develops within itself . 
  as latvia drifts towards prosperity , it 's attitudes will shift . 
  well that 's how gay rights stuff seems to work - one decade a society rejects it completely and then a decade later a society is all of a sudden realizes that `` oh wow , those two dudes are n't bloodthirsty perverts , they are actually just two people in a stable and psychologically healthy life-long relationship '' and then * whoosh * that society accepts gay rights and stuff . 
  acceptance of gays was not a feature of western civilization until about 15 years ; historically it was shunned and persecuted . 
  [ show some respect for your betters , peasant !, 
   monsieur excuse me , but i think the term your looking for is * viscomte * monsieur ecureuil was what my great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather was called before * roi ecureuil 1 ^ er * gave him ( and his descendants ) the title of * viscomte ecureuil * in return for his bravery in the great acorn war of 1402 . 
  `` europeans , we hope to one day join your great european project and there are many amongst us who believe in what the european union stands for . '', 
  - the probable message of his video i 'm not sure i agree with calling it propaganda , i see it as more of a public , artistic expression of political ideology - which is a key political component in every free society . 
  i feel like your definition propaganda is really broad ... like using your definition , one * could * make the argument that wearing trendy clothing is self-propagating propaganda . 
  yea , i 'd believe that .
