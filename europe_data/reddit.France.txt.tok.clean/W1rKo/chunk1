the best was chirac https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=304uhize01c `` bonjour '' at the end hahaha . 
  so much more charisma than sarkozy or hollande . 
  he fucking speak to an english interviewer . 
  are you idiot or what ? 
  not at all . 
  it make sense to force a change in the eu . 
  without threats nothing will change . 
  who cares if she won the 1st . 
  not a big deal . 
  people do n't vote for melenchon because he is not really in favor of the eu . 
  his first solution is not to leave the eu . 
  42 % is a wrong number . 
  even if le pen won , it will be very hard for her to leave the eu with a referendum . 
  the frexit is not happening anytime soon . 
  it 's stupid . 
  if they vote for fillon , macron will be first easily and le pen could miss the 2nd round ... so there is no good gamble here . 
  late and now you have the russians supporting assad . 
  france is not against a military involvement , hollande wanted a military action in 2013 and he just say 30min ago that u.n talks are the priority `` if possible '' so ... and macron ( favorite to be next president ) yesterday was not against a military action in syria . 
  they both want assad out . 
  france wanted to bomb them in 2013 but it failed because of obama/usa  president fran\u00e7ois hollande has embraced the idea of a military intervention , telling french ambassadors in paris last monday that he was `` ready to punish '' assad i guess it is not the same with trump . 
  no sorry mali ca n't fight alone against jihadists ... 
  we can bring back colonialism to develop the countries ... 
  seriously a lot of countries in africa are not enough developed to fight against this problem . 
  when you have no professional army it 's a bit difficult . 
  we also have the `` chant des partisans '' ( song of the french resistance during ww2 ) a bit less bloody haha . 
  this is literally our 2nd national anthem , personnaly i like it even more than la marseillaise . 
  both are beautiful . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq07zqfzonq  mate , do you hear the dark flight of the crows over our plains ? 
   mate , do you hear the muffled clamour of enchained countries ? 
   hey , partisans , workers and peasants this is the signal  tonight the enemy will know the price of blood and tears ... -  join the sabotage , get off the hills , comrades !, 
   take the rifles , the machine gun , the grenades out of the straws . 
   hey , killers , with a bullet or by knife , kill swiftly !, 
   hey , saboteur , take care of your charge : dynamite ... -  it 's us smashing the prison bars for our brothers ,  the hatred on our backs and the hunger that drives us , the misery . 
   there are countries where people are dreaming deep in their beds ,  here , we , you see , we 're marching on and we 're getting killed , we 're getting whacked ...  yes , we 're getting whacked ... -  here everyone knows what he wants , what he does when it takes place ,  mate , if you go down , a mate out of the shadows takes your place . 
   tomorrow black blood will be drying under the sun on the roads ,  sing , colleagues , freedom is listening to us in the night ... 
  hillary would have won with the french election system . 
  stop comparing the usa and france.it 's not similar . 
  viva is not even a french word , but nice try . 
  60/40 is not really close ... 
  you know le pen was already popular before brexit or trump . 
  it wo n't change even if both trump and brexit are a fail . 
  she will have a good chance in 2022 if the next president do n't fix france 's problems . 
  le pen will be first most likely in the 1st round . 
  no way she end up 3rd . 
  the building behind https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c3%a2teau_des_ducs_de_bretagne, 
  there is no doubt about that . 
  the portugese community is huge in france , the uk is nowhere close and there are other eu countries with more portuguese than in the uk . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_people  the number of portuguese people living in england and wales has increased 141 % in the decade between 2001 and 2011 . 
  according to the 2011 uk census , there are 88,161 portuguese people living in england and wales , against only 36,555 registered in 2001, 
  there are far more people in france originally from portugal than in the uk . 
  i do n't understand your comment . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_in_the_united_kingdom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_people_in_france, 
  proper house * :d, 
  what ? 
  all in france , 
  not like the french people protest all the time . 
  at least the diverse communities are well integrated because they also protest . 
  yeah pretty unknown in france, 
  me neither . 
   in france i can see drivers actually care about pedestrians well a lot of people ( like me ) go across the pedestrian crossing without waiting the car to stop so the driver have to slow down . 
   you guys do n't piss away loads of money on supercarriers , either . 
  that 's the problem we need another aircraft carrier . 
  we 're are fucked again atm ... because the charles de gaulle is in drydock in the port of toulon for an 18-month refit and upgrade . 
  it was less than [ 1 year ago ] ( http://www.defense.gouv.fr/var/dicod/storage/images/base-de-medias/images/operations/cartes-des-theatres-d-operation/carte-des-operations-et-missions-militaires/4301039-25-fre-fr/carte-des-operations-et-missions-militaires.jpg ) we have less troops in mali for the operation barkhane atm . 
  the yougs drink a lot more beer or sprits . 
  wine is for older people or important dinner . 
  beer is too low on the graph in my opinion . 
  http://inpes.santepubliquefrance.fr/cfesbases/catalogue/pdf/1632.pdf 2014 in france men : - wine 45,4 % - beer 32,6 % - spirits and liqueurs 23,9 % men + women : - wine 37,1 % - beer 20,3 % - spirits and liqueurs 15,2 %, 
  mama le pen with his son vladimir, 
  not only his hands https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bstds-dpvl4 no english sub sorry, 
  fake like we do n't drink beer ? 
  and la redoute ( strong growth atm ) and many more . 
  roubaix is not dead . 
  it was an easy one . 
  you 're green , we 're green . 
  i do n't see any difference . 
  one of the most dangerous thing atm are the europeans in syria/iraq fighting for isis . 
  with the fall of isis , some of them will try to go back in europe . 
  so the external borders of europe need to be more controled . 
  well said, 
  well it 's very hard to stop attacks like this so it will happen again but when ... nobody knows . 
  these guys rarely become radicalised alone on the internet ... often in prison , mosque or because of bad friends . 
  lol what is this guy, 
  because fuck the ferrero rocher during christmas . 
  le pen will most likely be on the 2nd round . 
  check france24 english on youtube or on their website . 
  this guy is living the dream, 
  dupont-aignan 5 % hmm ... i doubt it . 
  france will have a larger population than germany in the future if nothing change . 
  lmao, 
  not in france at least . 
  france could have a larger population than germany in the future if germans do n't have more babies . 
  or easy money when you have kids, 
  what 's the price for 15 ? 
  and ? 
  pretty much in french culture since decades . 
  stop acting like protests are new in france to blame muslims and that le pen will fix that . 
  sarkozy and hollande were not really good presidents and some people are racists you know . 
  please stay on t_d, 
  no we still hate the uk .
