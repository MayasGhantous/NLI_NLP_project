  france - it really depends on the houses . 
  my first flat was in an old norman house ( tudor style , half timbering ) , and i could hear everything the neighbour above did , but not the next door neighbours . 
  second flat , renovated factory building : no sound . 
  current house , about 100 years old , touching a bar : no sound unless the bar owners climb the old creaky stairs . 
  i ca n't even hear the customers . 
  best bar neighbours , would recommend 100 % . 
  edit : in detached houses , no noise at all . 
  when my neighbour 's monoxide detector rang , it took us at least half an hour to hear it !, 
  ( she lived ), 
  i 've always refused to , despite going through airports regularly at some point . 
  also in primary school , at ager 10 , our teacher gave us a very brief lesson on how babies were made , with a picture of a couple in missionary with a cut to show the penis inside the vagina . 
  there 's a french competitor to east pack called vicquel . 
  they make the same bags , call them v-pack , with a lifetime guarantee ( or they did 16 years ago ) . 
  i used their bag for over 15 years and several continents . 
  french woman here . 
  we have the same rights as men . 
  i do n't think there 's systemic inequality . 
  the only sexism we suffer from is individual or sometimes ingrained in social dynamics , but i still think it 's important to fight it . 
  if you apply to it you should be able to speak french with your fingers in your nose soon !, 
  i like * to fart higher than one 's ass * ( p\u00e9ter plus haut que son cul ) = to be pretentious , full of it . 
  to do something with * one 's fingers in one 's nose * ( les doigts dans le nez = super easily , without difficulty ( = with my hands tied in my back ) . 
  yeah and it sucks . 
  22 inches ? 
  what is that ? 
  i do n't have twenty two inches , how am i supposed to know how long it is ? 
  so [ the turkey song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnvo_w_gswg ) is not a popular thanksgiving song ? 
  ( it 's a song for efl learners ) . 
  i did . 
  but where does it come from ? 
  mc is the accepted diminutive for mac in scottish surnames . 
  is it an accent , or would they actually spell it mic if asked to ? 
  what country is this ? 
  it 's gorgeous . 
  is it a bridge in the far distance ? 
  the splitting of the roads make it look like an unfolding landscape out of inception !, 
  i 'm french but the only time i got to witness the tour de france was abroad too , in england . 
  2007 i think . 
  a [ gallery from my home town - quimperl\u00e9 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/9thzx ) in france . 
  every picture i see of edinburgh just makes me want to visit more . 
  france : - `` maternelle '' from 2 to 6 ( most kids starts at 3 or later in cities where there are n't enough room - kid must be potty trained to be admitted ) - primary from 6 to 11 - `` coll\u00e8ge '' ( yeah , that leads to confusion ) from 11 to 15 - `` lyc\u00e9e '' from 15 to 18 . 
  lyc\u00e9e is where education become specialised . 
  there are professional , technical and general lyc\u00e9es , which various curriculums within . 
  the general lyc\u00e9e is seen as more prestigious ; it leads to college education generally . 
  at the end of lyc\u00e9e you take the baccalaureate exam . 
  if you succeed , you may enter college/university , which is public and practically free ( compared to the us ) . 
  there are also private options for all levels of education . 
  school is n't compulsory in france , `` schooling '' is , ( from 6 to 15 ) which includes homeschooling . 
  it 's strange to imagine 6 year-olds and 15 year-olds going to the same school . 
  vegetables : beans , tomatoes , carrots , potatoes , pumpkin , cabbage & cauliflowers . 
  fruit : apple is the most popular . 
  also eaten in pies & sauce . 
  oranges , and bananas from our oversea territories . 
  grain-based : bread , pasta . 
  meat : beef & pork are the most popular . 
  also veal , mutton , lamb , horse but it is getting harder to find . 
  not much fish , except in sea-side region , but even so it 's more of a once-a-week thing . 
  dairy : lots of cheese , yoghurt 's a popular dessert . 
  beverages : cider , beer & wine , juice for kids , coffee , tea & herbal tea . 
  but have you got terrible teeth ? 
  and the mussels . 
  no fries without mussels . 
  i could n't even point to hungary on a map ... 
   women are n't hairy . 
  they must have seen me and assumed all french women are the same . 
  vercingetorix is spinning in his tomb ... 
  in terms of cost , it 's great . 
  waiting time is another story . 
  i 've moved around a lot over the last ten years . 
  finding general practitioners was easy enough , but if i wanted to see a specialist , i was either told that they did n't take new clients , or that i had to wait months . 
  that includes trying to get a non-urgent appointment in hospital . 
  i 've had a bad gum infection and i 'm going to need a crown in a few days , and i think if i 'd been able to see a dentist sooner , it could have been avoided . 
  i 've stayed in a convent this summer and even they did n't have pictures of jesus . 
  just saw a cross . 
  for real ? 
  condoms are `` capotes anglaises '' in french . 
  our countries and languages have a long love/hatred story . 
  it really depends on regions . 
  wine is mostly south of the loire river . 
  north-west france drinks cider , north-east beer . 
  peanut butter is pretty hard to come by in france ( it 's a shame , i love it ) . 
  common groceries would be bread , butter & jam , pasta , rice , canned/frozen vegetables . 
  most common meats are beef , veal & pork . 
  common hot drinks would be coffee or tea . 
  cereals are mostly for children . 
  common alcoholic drinks : wine , cider & beer . 
  smoked meat is rare . 
  pasta sauce is pre-made . 
   irse a la francesa ( going/leaving the french way ) in french we call it * filer \u00e0 l'anglaise * , that is to say leaving the english way . 
  and `` to speak french like a spanish cow '' means to speak really mangled french . 
  the word for cow , * vache * , may actually be a deformed version of * basque * , which makes sense : a person from the spanish side of the bask country woul n't speak really good french . 
  but then , neither would a spanish cow . 
  finally , `` c'est du chinois pour moi '' ( * it 's chinese to me * ) means i do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  no but picture this : super ripe , crumbly roquefort , on fresh baguette . 
  i 'm already salivating . 
  2nd place is a tie between cheddar and goat cheese . 
  3rd is roquefort . 
  4th is camembert . 
  parlant franc\u00e8s sounds like something out of les visiteurs . 
  as a french , written italian , spanish and portuguese are pretty easy to understand . 
  i 'd say i can understand 3/4 of a simple text in those languages ( now , not dante or cervantes ) .
