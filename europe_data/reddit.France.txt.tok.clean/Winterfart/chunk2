  piss off troll account !, 
  despicable . 
  yes , french : the nationality . 
  they 're french . 
  this is how they call themself too . 
  that 's spot on . 
  this is why they are still obsessed with clinton losing and are all talking about the next election . 
  it 's only a game to them , and the only thing that matter is winning it . 
  to be fair , trump himself act like that ... 
  he 's not dodging , he 's just admiting he 's not an expert in everything . 
  are you ? 
  the five best french satirists were executed by terrorists two years ago , french far-right is on the rise ... 
  i 'm in a similar mood than you . 
  all i can see are panicked and unable western governements , everywhere i look . 
  trust is lost . 
  all in all i think that , sadly , terrorists won . 
  yes , good satire is a sign of a healthy society . 
  next time i 'll wear a red beret so you 'll know it 's me . 
  i protect my balls with one hand and stay vertical . 
  i precise that we jumps from the middle plateform , the top is difficult ( and forbiden ) to access , so it 's not that high , 
  do that every summers , always a blast ( i live in al\u00e8s ) . 
  one ca n't be imposed something he chose . 
  do n't you understand words ? 
  * `` we 're not repeating history because it 's not about jews this time '' *, 
  correction : that 's how you survive . 
  and you 're talking about primal fears , here , not the same thing . 
  they are fleeing war and death . 
   so why not scold them ? 
  so , that was a real question ... 
  remind me of schoolyard arguments and i 'm kind of * to old * ( and clever ) * for this shit . 
  * i wish you good luck with all of your fears , and i hope wilders loses so you ca n't have no satisfaction . 
  who said there was something wrong ? 
  you can say whatever you want , dude . 
  free continent . 
   a phobia implies that the fear as no reason . 
  because you 're pulling that definition out of your ass . 
  a phobia can have reasons or not , that 's has nothing to do whith anything . 
  you just want to express xenophobia without having to take responsability for your shitty words . 
  but to answer you , you should n't take decision based on fear ( weither it 's a reasonable fear or not , fear of christians or muslims or whatever ) . 
  nobody except kids should . 
  how are refugees backward islamists while being islamophobes at the same time ? 
  like all panicked people , you are not making any sense . 
   nobody has anything against an muslim with an attitude to religion as the avverage european fear of someone different than you . 
  that 's the etymological definition of xenophobia . 
  yeah they won . 
  they 're terrorists and you 're talking like a terrorized man right now . 
  fear breeds hate . 
   that 's not our problem say no more . 
  i 'm done with this thread . 
  glad you can come out your shitty closet . 
  and i 'm jealous . 
  this is textbook xenophobia . 
  it 's where poor people lives . 
  even war refugees ? 
  tonight , i really wonder what happened to basic human decency . 
  fucking isis won after all ... 
  so ** all ** people with `` backward views '' should be banned disregarding their origin or religion , no ? 
  do you really think that all islam have to offer is terrorism ? 
  * username does n't checks out . 
  it is . 
  you sure do n't sound `` enriched '' . 
  the crusaders did . 
  seems we have n't learned anything . 
  i 'm really ashamed of all europe tonight . 
  well , that 's depressing . 
   muslims choose to have islam imposed on them wherever they go this sentence does n't make sense . 
  are you that acariatre ? 
  a bubble called * earth * . 
  * the ends justify the means * is a pretty good description of right wings to me . 
  beautiful graphics and good level of detail . 
  nice work , nature !, 
  we need a job . 
  material for parodists . 
  i was n't aware that hollande had been destitute because of his private life ( unlike b. clinton for exemple ) . 
  lol ? 
  i agree , cheating on his wife maybe is dishonest but does n't affect politic . 
  corruption or embezzlement are the kind of dishonest we do n't like , i think . 
   i imagine they 'll want assurance that we 'll fully embrace the project , not just straddle both sides of the line to get the best of both worlds . 
  that would be the `` normal '' treatment . 
  it could be worst . 
  so death is our only hope . 
  cheers , 
   especially since the uk is expected to become the most populated country in europe in the next decades maybe that will change if ue countries become very powerfull and attractive , so uk will be ( re ) accepted in without much problems ... maybe ... 
  there must be something to do against , it ca n't continue like that . 
  i sincerely hopes eu wo n't act like a bitch if that happen . 
  you 're right and those are all good points for not leaving . 
  i do n't think we french people are more clever than english or welsh people , but our media outlets are generally speaking ... less dumb ... 
  so i 'm optimistic ( in a pro-ue way ) . 
  by the past in france , the exact opposite happenned ** every time ** a populist made it to the second turn . 
  they got crushed by a sudden boost of * [ whatever the opposite of populism is , idk ] * but of course , everything is theoretically possible . 
  it changes nothing . 
  elders have rights and are part of uk society . 
  but okay , it 's noted . 
  she wo n't be president . 
  but why * `` tougher '' * ? 
  still ... 
  different countries , different system , different people ... 
  that awfull media outlet is a real problem . 
  that sentiment of `` not being part of ( continental ) europe '' is typically brit , tough , and it played a big part in the decision , me think . 
  hadrian made the picts pay for it .
