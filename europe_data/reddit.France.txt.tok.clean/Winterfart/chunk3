  we know growth , we have the best growths ... 
  i do n't see the ship sinking ( this is the uk after all , you 've seen worst by the past ) , but you 're in for 10 tough years . 
  nice one . 
  nice cheese , bro . 
  united we fly ... 
  yes , on that particularly :  i 'm proud of my country surviving ; everyone should be . 
  because the odds of it happening are so dramatically low . 
  it 's amazing , really , how so many fell just for the few that rose . 
  so many lost to time . 
  surviving this long alone is something of praise , at least to me . 
  you 're spinning it wrong . 
  one can dream a little . 
  you 're probably right . 
  do the fn still have a private `` militia '' composed with neo nazi skinheads ? 
  because they had that when le pen senior what head of the party ... 
  she does n't know what she want , she only know what she does n't want . 
  yeah , so in my opinion ( wich i agree with more than any other 's  ) you are a patriot , not a nationalist . 
  i 'm a patriot too . 
   and yes that 's the correct word thanks !, 
  that 's flattering ( - ish ) , but you 're again equating * my person with all of france . 
  thank you for the other kind words , and for understanding so clearly the idea of freedom of mind . 
  * is that word correct in english ? 
  you 're just generalizing , i 'm not france , just a french . 
  and i honestly do n't care about that ( * your * ? ), 
  definition of nationalism . 
  i 'm fine with mine , thank you very much . 
  yes , it is ... sir . 
  some men just want to watch roman burn . 
  i 'm offended !, 
  the sky is black , sometime . 
  there 's is no such thing as good nationalism , in my opinion , so i ca n't answer that question . 
  hey , i 'm french and i just made a witty comment in english , i pay my lip to diversity  french are initially celts , but you do n't see us trying to go back to celtic languages just because we do n't like that the roman empire invaded us long time ago ... 
  i 'm not proud that 30 % of english language is derived from old french ( well , maybe a little proud ) , it 's more that i do n't like nationalism in any form , and i 'm pretty sure nationalism is involved here . 
  * a patriot loves his country , a nationalist hates everyone else 's *, 
  simple snake ? 
  a new mgs ? 
  still pissed about that tiny norman-french invasion ? 
  make me cry ... 
   insane bbq aaah bbq , i love prehistoric gastronomy , 
  germany is a blessed land for sausages . 
  * oh , you 're no fun anymore . 
  * i did n't call you things , i called you nuts . 
  you 're nuts . 
  true . 
  yes it is . 
  but that 's the * position * ( wich i agree with ) , not the * tone * . 
  well , it does n't matter so much , i guess i 'll have to not following brexit 's news every day because it depress me a little ... :(, 
  i prefer the french saying : * ils veulent le beurre , l'argent du beurre et le sourire de la cr\u00e9mi\u00e8re en prime ... ( they want the butter , the butter money and the creamiere 's smile as a bonus . . ) * i understand the necessity of all of that , being pro-eu , but i find the tone of both `` side '' very disappointing and i hope it wo n't last too long . 
  i mean , uk will still be our neibhgours after their exit , and unless a weird desatre happen , they will still be our neibhgours like ... forever ... 
  i do n't know much about castro 's `` achievement '' . 
  it seems to me that he was as much of a dictator as a liberator ( because us gov interference in south america 's countries is real and detrimental ) . 
  well , you 're right , i do think what you are saying sound far-stretched . 
  i live in south france in a long time socialist town and things are ok . not perfect but freedom and wellness are here for sure . 
  ( your english is fine for me , this is not my first language neither ), 
  you 're right . 
  thanks !, 
  i just checked and realised i was wrong about that for many years ... ^ oups !, 
  even if i was joking around , that was an interesting read . 
  i thought there was a concept of hell in judaism ... is there different schools of thought on that subject or what ? 
  not all the french are so proud about napo as you are . 
  civil law , and he backed archeology when it was n't even a science , that 's the only thing i like about the guy . 
  he was a bloodlusty despot ( enlighten or not , i do n't care ) . 
  perhaps . 
  all in all , i ca n't equate socialism with communism but i can easily equate far right with nazism and fascism ( 'cause , you know , they * were * far right ) . 
  maybe if i was slavic i would fear communism as much as you do , but in western europe adolf and benito did the damage . 
  sure . 
  sure ... my opinion is that they will regret those victories but that 's only ... like ... my opinion ... 
  i do n't understand all of it ( far from it ) , but it will be really tiresome for everybody if those `` discussions '' keep the same tone for two years ... 
  as a french , i would prefer we fight brits ( a respectable `` foe '' ) instead of those isis shitheads . 
  well , they did have some kind of victories over this year , they became confident ( poor guys ) . 
  * `` leftist '' , `` joke '' , `` failling miserably '' , `` brainwash '' , `` propaganda '' . . ? 
  * it 's like a youtube comment  i was talking about the 1930 's , by the way , i 'm not predicting anything . 
  i ca n't know the future but i know the past . 
  [ cake !,

  too soon ? 
  gay is secular . 
  secularism is n't a `` choose and pick '' . 
  it 's about all religions . 
  positive discrimination is n't a good thing , i agree , but it 's not based on racial hate . 
  that famous `` fall of europe '' almost happened when far right people were voted in power . 
  let 's try something else . 
  we need a trumpxit . 
  not all right wing guys are racist , but all the racists are right wing . 
  `` come with me if you want to live in the ue '', 
  double exclamation mark !, 
  we will try . 
  bad move . 
  vikings believed that the * given word * was sacred , maybe something has remain from that time . 
  or maybe it 's the higher standart of living ... 
  the north trust . 
  with good music . 
   basically , the us stereotype of germans is that they 're a bunch of nazis stay classy , usa !, 
  yeah , tell that to the [ belgian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_of_belgium ) . 
  she was a symbol of courage , a * porte-\u00e9tendard * , but she did n't have military education and never fight . 
  she was wounded by an arrow , not in a melee . 
  as golvan said , she was badass but not in a * action woman * way . 
  you 're not fun anymore .
