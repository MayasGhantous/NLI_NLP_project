  i prefer having my rivalry with clever englishmen , not internet kids . 
  bye now !, 
  you know , you should n't start a banter if you gon na whine at the first response . 
  because i 'm joking too , you muppet , and you 're the one who whined immediately . 
  if you do n't like losing , do n't play , 
  i prefer wine to beer , therefore i 'm a pansie ? 
  til that media did n't exist before the internet . 
  you maybe right . 
  i was a construction worker in my youth , nobody were censuring themself ( even though they should have , sometimes ... ) , but i can imagine things are different in an office or a shop . 
  and you witnessed an `` extreme '' unassimilation ? 
  where exactly ? 
  yes , school , sport and also work . 
  in the end , it 's by mingle with people that you really know them . 
  have you ever been in one of the place you talk about ? 
  i 'm not saying your absolutely wrong , but i assure you with first hand experience ( i lived in those place for the majority of my life ) that thing are not as bad as you make it sound . 
  most people here are people , and just that . 
  majority of young french of arabic descent are n't even muslim , let alone radical muslim . 
  it 's a classic case of `` few bad apple ruining the batch '' . 
  nothing more . 
  institutionalized racism make them kind of second zone citizens , and that 's a real problem but it 's the same in every western country ( look at black people in the us ... ) . 
  your entire comment is an * `` armchair expertise '' * ; reality `` on the field '' is different , and not as grim as you seems to believe . 
  fun fact : lol . 
  he 's your friend , and now he 's your lucky charm . 
  wine is stronger than beer , chav . 
  and you 're a pariah for posting in the_donald . 
  zero tolerance for people coming from this insane and racist sub . 
  you have no argument , only hate and fear . 
  get lost , pariah !, 
  you 're a the_donald poster . 
  technically , it 's * saut\u00e9 * . 
  `` wolf nipple chips . 
  get 'em while they 're hot . 
  they 're lovely . '', 
  they 're bald but they 're coward ... 
  you have to say it like [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1yvvnvlxtg ), 
  you mean wine . 
  why the / s ? 
  indo-europeans describe a type of human culture ( `` indo-european languages '' , mostly ) not an ethnie . 
  they ca n't be the three musketeers if they 're only three ... 
  de gaulle ? 
  lol . 
  paranoid humanoid . 
  thanks , trump 's interviews are always a good laugh . 
  yeah , he 's usually more funny ... 
  * give me back my english tourists !, 
  they 're french !, 
  scared people are stupid . 
   act normal , that 's crazy enough . 
   better a good neighbour than a faraway friend . 
  very good , will use those . 
  brexit means breakfast ? 
  i 'm in . 
  legos are more lethal . 
  be patient . 
  every time , dude !, 
  every fucking time ... 
  no surprise here . 
  also , never ever feed him after midnight . 
  of course , there 's bad slavers and good slavers / s, 
  it 's more dangerous that the average french town , but that 's not saying it 's a warzone , you can still have a good time as a tourist . 
  come on !, 
  puking wine is fun !, 
  guys , this is an intervention . 
  n\u00eemes is the second worst place i lived , after b\u00e9ziers ... 
  but to each his tastes . 
  i lived in n\u00eemes few years ago , and knew a guy who was in charge of the washing . 
  grafiti are not the real problem , pollution is . 
  it already should be mandatory , by toutatis !, 
  only when those cops are [ smuggling ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2016/09/22/01016-20160922artfig00099-des-policiers-belges-arretes-en-france-avec-des-migrants-dans-leur-fourgon.php ) illegals immigrants in france ~ ~ because they do n't want to deal with them ~ ~ . 
  i have some emergency duvel , does that count ? 
  no tea ? 
  this is how i like my far-right activist : dumber than a box of rocks . 
  yep , that 's the real answer . 
  aaaaah , la douce ulla !, 
  the point is `` pain '' in french have more meaning than just `` bread '' . 
  this is a conversation . 
  what about `` pain de savon '' or `` pain de c4 '' ? 
  in china . 
  and we love you for that . 
  also , sorry for the mess ... 
  more like the global idiocracy timeline ... 
  dungeon crawler, 
  also , his daughter was booed by some germans last month . 
  history is not your * forte * . 
  tony soprano . 
  who ? 
  santa claus ? 
  remember french bashing ? 
  now it 's your turn . 
  it meant goodbye . 
   a pm like macron ok . 
  * france * was , * is * , and always will be * bacon * . 
  are you alright ? 
  you seem to be in some distress . 
  you do n't know what a pedophile is . 
  a pig with a wig . 
  a low energy old man at that . 
  ladies and gentlemen , place your bets !, 
  lions are gay . 
  an erotic ticking timebomb !,
