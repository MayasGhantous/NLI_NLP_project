  go home zeus !, 
  when you 're drunk , you start talking like may . 
  it 's your age , right ? 
  now it is . 
  you sound bitter . 
  reeeeeeeeeee !, 
  what is this ? 
  a union for ants ? 
  i have only one thing to respond : * gollum !, 
  the only clever comment in the all thread . 
  many protesters ( not violent rioters ) have been hospitalized after being beaten by the cops those last few years . 
  this is a sad escalation of violence , but it 's not one sided in the slightest . 
  that being said , i wish this cop survive his injuries . 
  nobody deserve to go like that . 
  well , thank you again ( * bis * ) . 
  it 's a latin word , it simply means `` twice '' , yo !, 
  argh !, 
  the worst thing is ( that ? ), 
  those rules are exactly the same as in french ... 
  not common . 
  i mistaken , i should have wrote the uk . 
  noted . 
  thanks !, 
  all the episodes are on youtube , 
  yep , same question here . 
  i did like it , even though i did n't understood everything ... chris morris is a ( an ? ), 
  hilarious chap , denholm reynholm in the it crowd is one of my favorite character ever !, 
  or black books . 
  or spaced . 
  or the it crowd . 
  or big train . 
  a touch of cloth . 
  garth marenghi 's darkplace . 
  the flying circus . 
  the black adder ... 
  damn !, 
  albion have so many good tv shows !, 
  you 're always such a positive guy , kaka !, 
  uh ... no ... nothing ... have a good night . 
  hey !, 
  [ who can blame them ? 
  ] ( http://yogadork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/putin-on-a-horse-500x375.jpg ), 
  you 're so cute !, 
  * `` this is the way the uk ends * * not with a bang but a big whine . '' * ;p, 
   same would go for someone putting a `` holocaust never happened ! '', 
  sign . 
  we 're kind of snowflakes in europe ( especially in france and germany ) regarding everything ww2 related : someone doing that in france would be in real trouble . 
  and you 're maybe right , maybe it would be better to let him do so we can know where he stands ... that 's food for thoughts , and i thank you . 
   sunshine is the best disinfectant !, 
  very nice saying !, 
   there is no need for subterfuge from them . 
  true . 
  i really do n't know which is better between the us absolute free speech ( which sound great on paper ) and limited free speech like we have here ( for good reasons ) . 
  i guess both have their own inconvenience . 
  did you try to prove me that i , in fact , agree with you ? 
  that 's bloody hilarious !, 
  too silly this discussion became . 
  have a good day . 
  yeah , we 've been a little too far with that . 
  good . 
  beware peppe : [ german ninja ] ( http://needcoffee.cachefly.net/needcoffee/uploads/2008/09/enter-the-ninja-white-ninja.jpg ) is watching you !, 
  yes . 
   are n't you the one who claimed that without an eu ** political ** union did i ? 
  you should read again . 
   however , the election is n't over . 
  france leaving the eu is still a real possibility that 's a possibility so thin right now that it 's almost imposible ( and i 'm really glad ) . 
  perhaps if brexit have n't happen , a frexit would not end the ue . 
  but the uk * and * france leaving ? 
  that would be a too serious blow ... 
  the ue would maybe still be a thing , in a way , but in a different form with a different name ... not really the ue in reality . 
  you 're only looking at ** recent ** history and that 's really shortsighted , * in my view * . 
  only if you heard of the fn for the first time less than two month ago . 
  the fn have been in the french political landscape for all my life , and it always have been the same bullshit with them . 
  mr dickbutts3000 , did n't you see that i was n't really talking to miss may ( like she care what i have to say ... ) ? 
  i was adressing to us , european in the european union . 
  i 'm in campaign too , at my own little level , 
  then laugh . 
  because of history . 
  france has been permanently involved in wars for more than a millenium , like the rest of europe ( we were fighting each other after all !, 
  since the end of ww2 and the creation of the ue we all have known the longest period of peace ever . 
  * i do n't have my crystal ball with me , so i 'm like anybody else , i ca n't see the future , but fear of war in europe is not at all insanity , it 's a perfectly reasonable and educate fear . 
  we have forgotten how bad things can go ( and how quickly they can go bad ) , because of that sweet sweet peace that the ue gave us . 
  * i 'm not sure that sentence is correct ... 
   i ca n't tell if you 're arguing that france wo n't leave the eu , or if that the eu wo n't fall apart without france . 
  i was just bragging about the fact that nobody will ever kick france out of the ue ... nobody !, 
  :p  if france leaves the eu , all the other countries are not going to give up on the project . 
  well , did n't you see all the support that europhile have give to macron all over the ue ? 
  that 's because they think it 's the opposite and fear that if france leave after the uk did , the ue is done . 
  i have a feeling that this discussion is just about you trying to undermine the importance of france in the ue , and me trying to defend it . 
  if that 's the case , that 's a little too nationalistic for me ... so bye !, 
  have a good day . 
  look , that will never happen . 
  france will kick itself out of the ue or stay in it . 
  the very idea of the ue is originaly french , and most french people loves it to the core . 
  i understand your frustration , but what you 're saying is delusional . 
  edit : i 'm not very sure that you understand the implications of that : * `` france and germany at each other throat '' *, 
  without permanent seat at the security concil , without independant nuclear arsenal , and with france and germany at each other throat ( again ) ... good luck with that !,
