that guy is awesome . 
  he can indeed be proud !, 
   swimming pools  ireland yeah sure mate . 
  so brave . 
   say that france is a beautiful country , then clarify that you have only been to paris but that should be enough to form an impression . 
  i 'm already shaking from anger ... it works !, 
  i like 1664 :(, 
  yup !, 
  like in every other country to be fair . 
  the popular ones are never the best ones . 
  if my experiences there are any indication ( and i do n't think it is ) : chupitoooossssss, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ky30bthnpw1qznre8o1_500.jpg ), 
  h\u00e9l\u00e8ne is a very old name , almost nobody was named h\u00e9l\u00e8ne in france in the last 10 years . 
  it 's also wrong unfortunately , ellen as a name barely even exist . 
  it 's emma , which i guess is also international , 
  ellen ? 
  nope , not even close . 
  never even heard it and i 've lived here my whole life . 
  if you do n't bother to read my comment why should i bother replying to you ? 
  i 'm just gon na copy paste :  now i 'm not wearing a tinfoil hat and i do n't actually think that they will do something with those information for now , but i still strongly prefer the first option , and i do n't see how anyone with some common sense could disagree on this point . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : it 's not about conspiracy theories , it 's about how it should not be an option in the first place . 
  and you 're in / r/europe mon ami , so you 'll have reactions and opinions from all the different countries . 
  that 's the whole point of the subreddit . 
  to see how it is elswhere , to have a different point of view . 
  i just read this whole thread and it 's pretty sad to see all the english people defending this system in this whole thread , saying `` yeah it just takes 5min to turn off , you just have to ask to get it removed , it 's not censorship '' the thing you guys does n't seem to understand is that it should be the other way around . 
  and yes , it does make a big difference . 
  it 's either asking your internet provider to `` please enable parental control so my children do n't look at inappropriate content ' , versus `` please allow me to look at censored content '' , and having this request registered with your full identity . 
  now i 'm not wearing a tinfoil hat and i do n't actually think that they will do something with those information ** for now ** , but i still strongly prefer the first option , and i do n't see how anyone with some common sense could disagree on this point . 
  wow .

   all mobile phone companies have been doing this for years yeah in ** england ** maybe . 
  never heard of that here . 
  5 minutes too much . 
  oh sorry , we did n't know you represented the whole opinion of england . 
  exactly . 
  they got the thing the wrong way . 
  let the parents who want parental control activate the option themselves and leave everyone else the fuck alone !, 
  that 's already way more than it should be . 
  there you go : http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/ukrainian-evidence-russian-involvement-east-n86076, 
  well they need to load/unload the trucks at some point . 
  and i 'm sure there 's way more means of spying than aerial spying . 
  even without knowing that , how can we , in this day and age , not know what a big fucking convoy like this is up to and what exactly are in the trucks ? 
  that 's what spying is for initialy , and not collecting all my calls and text messaging , not to mention the porn i watched yesterday . 
  and [ montpellier ] ( http://md1.libe.com/photo/637353-montpellier_tam.jpg?modified_at=1397551565&amp;width=750 )  [ more ] ( http://media.meltycampus.fr/article-1298457-ajust_930/le-tramway-de-montpellier.jpg ) and [ another one ] ( http://www.djpsar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tram_de_montpellier_01-600x250.jpg ) . 
  i 'm just saying it 's a cultural thing . 
  if you do n't think american in general are more judgmental than french , you 're just kidding yourself . 
  that 's a fact . 
  of course not all the americans are judgmental , especially on reddit where people seem to be more open about those things . 
  i 've never said such a thing and it would be a silly thing to say . 
  well , france also is one of the least religious country on the list . 
  i think i 'm not taking too much risk by saying there 's a connection . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  yeah i 'm proud !, 
  also , this explains so fucking much about some threads that i see here on reddit and do n't understand . 
  i 've grown up with the notion of not judging people , which ( and please do n't take this wrong ) seems to be one of the most popular american sport . 
  damn !, 
  too late :(, 
  well you are the op . 
  it 's up to you to tell us why !, 
  yeah what 's funny is that while trying to deny it this guy basically prove the point of him being `` inconsistently paranoic '' . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  i tried to read it , i really did , but i gave up after this part :  so it is a form of brain defect . 
  a disability . 
  yes , it is bad to treat it harshly , yes , they deserve pity and compassion . 
  just like the guy in a wheelchair . 
  but the problem is that the modern world wants to see it as just as good as being normal . 
  and it is of course not , for the above reasons . 
  as long as the guy in the wheelchair understands he is disabled , that he is not fully functional and normal , he deserves help and respect . 
  i was hoping you were a troll but you seem way too dedicated . 
  it 's very sad that you think this way . 
  i 'm not going to try and argue with you because i have better things to do and i know damn right that people like you ca n't change their minds . 
  holy shit are n't you completely dumb . 
  i know damn well that people like you exist but i 'm really surprised to see them on reddit . 
  hell i 'm surprised you can even use a computer . 
  downvoted for asking a valid question , i thought / r/europe was better than that . 
  edit : when i made that comment he was at -7 . 
  the odds have changed !, 
  yeah i agree , i was n't even aware of what is said in this article . 
  here 's the [ picture ] ( http://files.newsnetz.ch/bildlegende/124942/1544330_pic_970x641.jpg ) if anyone 's interested  [ another .

   it happens every time it floods . 
   ireland so ... basically all the time ? 
  you 're damn right i do !, 
  this is an outrage !, 
  with cheese ? 
  that 's pretty ironic for anti-eu parties too seek eu support to make a eu anti-eu force . 
  but i guess they all have the same goals so that makes sense . 
   since it 's the eu 's most spoken language . 
  what ? 
  and ... quebec !, 
  they do n't even clean after themselves , so do n't expect them to clean for others !, 
  actually there is !, 
  staring at a night sky filled with stars * with music and a nice spliff . 
  yeah cause for the meals you eat at mc donald or kfc the animals are treated way better . 
  either you protest everything and go full vegan or you ignore it , but targeting only the fabrication of foie gras is pretty hypocrite . 
  what ?
