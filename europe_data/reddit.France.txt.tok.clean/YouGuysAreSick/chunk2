  why ? 
  that thing is the most delicious thing ever !, 
  my grandfather make it himself and that 's just fantastic !, 
  ho now this is a question i like !, 
  i 'd brought red wine , foie gras , saucisson , red wine , cassoulet , magret de canard , a lot of cheese , red wine and a baguette !, 
  did i say red wine ? 
  red wine . 
  for example in my lycee , some students would often wear [ this kind of shirts ] ( http://yahoo.marseille.bondyblog.fr/images/tshirt_algerie.jpg ) and no one would say anything about it . 
  well try living in popular neighboorhoud of a big city , or just go to lycee . 
  i live in france too buddy . 
  and i 've experienced it !, 
  with shirts too, 
  well the two should be perfectly acceptable imo , as long as the person is not acting like a douche . 
   in the uk well there you go . 
  totaly different . 
  shame on me !, 
  corrected . 
  well i saw 3 words and we have 3 words too , that 's why i said it . 
  but i do n't know shit about german . 
  yup . 
  single and plural . 
  exemple : english `` the dog - the dogs '' french `` le chien - les chiens '', 
  well even our national football team does n't sing our national anthem anymore ... 
  of course it would be you , [ germoney ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/grammar_nazi_icon_text.svg ) . 
  but to be perfectly honest we 're even . 
  in french it 's '' le , la , les '' . 
  i can confirm , as an avid subscriber of the subreddit . 
  but it 's always good to remind it , as in the english language there 's only `` the '' , so you guys tend to translate all with `` le '' , and always forget the poor `` la '' . 
  french is so damn complicated . 
  in france it 's more acceptable to display an algeria 's flag than a french one . 
  in the first case people will say you 're proud of your origins , in the second they will label you as a racist . 
  til there really was a law that made it illegal for germans to display patriotism and german flags , even at sports event . 
  this eventually stopped around 2000 .

  , and `` viva espa\u00f1a '' would be better too . 
  i know you did n't make the comic but wanted to clarify . 
   portuguese men are allegedly known to be the most handsome men in europe really ? 
  in france the stereotype is that they are hairy and not really attractive . 
  then again there 's cristiano ronaldo . 
  i got ta admit i was quite surprised myself . 
  i guess these are just persons from a catholic family , who do n't believe in god but get baptized and marry at the church to please their older relative etc. . . that 's my guess . 
  tradition . 
  well , same here . 
  also lidl , intermarche and casino . 
  shhhhh , 
  absolutely . 
  believe it or not , but according to a 2006 study even our fellow catholics do n't believe in god ... :  a 2006 poll found that 51 % of the french population describe themselves as catholics ** ( and only half of those said they believed in god ) ** [ ... ] [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_france#statistics ) . 
  so it 's mostly a cultural thing . 
  and it 's dying fast . 
  i 'm proud about our religious views !, 
  well did you actually check the results ? 
  we are apparently the ones that disagree the most with that saying !, 
  relevant username cher compatriote !, 
  i 'm exactly like you . 
  5 or 6 spliff & 2 cigarettes/week approximately . 
  only when i drink too . 
  never in the work week . 
  do n't worry , as a french , this surprised me too . 
  and i now understand you confusion . 
  all is good , have a nice day , 
  yeah , i was really surprised that people tried to defend him at first , now i understand , 
  the attackers ? 
  where were the attackers here ? 
  ** edit : ** okkkkkk i read again the op english source and i understand all of your confusions people . 
  it 's because the guy who wrote the article is a dumbass who apparently ca n't translate properly . 
  the whole `` banging and kicking at the doors and windows of the mayor 's home and his car '' thing happened ** after ** the shooting , to confront him . 
  sources : [ here ] ( http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flci.tf1.fr%2ffrance%2ffaits-divers%2fle-maire-d-un-village-de-moselle-accuse-de-violence-avec-arme-8132706.html ), 
  of course it exist , i 'm just not sure how drunk young guys playing with fireworks in your street can be life threatening though . 
   and that you hope he goes to jail because he 's only a `` mayor '' of a small town , and `` an old redneck fuck '' . 
  what ? 
  this has nothing to do with all of that . 
  i hope he goes to jail because in france , you do n't shoot at people . 
  period . 
  he could 've killed him . 
  this is not america , we have police . 
  if someone annoy you , you call the police , and they take care of it . 
  you ... what ... but ... how ? 
  are you high ? 
  where in my comment can you see something remotely close to this ? 
  ** why is this posted on this subbreddit ? 
  this is n't even news in france . 
  let me clarify a little . 
  we 're talking about a `` mayor '' of a village of * 160 people * in some lost village . 
  so it 's not like he 's a known politician . 
  `` mayors '' of small villages here in france get paid very little cause there is almost nothing to do . 
  so they have a job like every other citizen in town . 
  this mayor happen to be an 61 years old , retired . 
  some young people celebrated our national day , the 14th , by shooting fireworks in his street , like it 's the tradition . 
  apparently this made him angry and he shooted , it 's confuse whever or not he aimed at them but the bullet end up near them and one was hurt from projections . 
  they tried to confront him but he did n't open his door . 
  they called the police . 
  the end . 
  so basically it 's your average story of an random old redneck fuck from the back country with the classic `` get off my lawn '' thing . 
  nothing interesting at all , i guess it happen everyday . 
  i hope he goes to jail though . 
  yup , that 's why i made the distinction . 
  i 'm a perfect exemple of this . 
  i 'm thin but certainly not `` healthy '' cause i do n't do enough sport . 
  hummmmm . 
  btw did you know there is a war in france about this little thing ?
