  the us spends $ 600bn on defense , which means that $ 600bn goes to the nato defense as well . 
  well , that is one retarded comment . 
  hypothetically those $ 600 billion would come into action only if one country member of nato is attacked when you will be obligated by treaty to defend it . 
  when no one is attacked like nowadays , i really doubt that the full american defense budget goes towards nato . 
  you do know that the us have operations all around the world ? 
   my point is that you do n't understand how spending works . 
  one last time i 'll give it a go . 
  john makes $ 100 a year . 
  john spends $ 50 on electricity and $ 50 on water . 
  john 's roommate spends $ 50 to pay the rest of the electricity bill . 
  john 's roommate decides to leave . 
  john now has a few options . 
  john can use less electricity , but that means he ca n't use all his nice things all the time . 
  john can spend less on water , meaning he will have to skip a shower , and use that money to help pay for more electricity for his nice things . 
  do you see how more money is n't magically added to this scenario ? 
  this is a totally wrong analogy as in our case there more than two players , and it does n't take into account debt for instance . 
  you think you understand how spending works - but you have absolutely no idea how financing and state budgets work . 
  in your case , the money that `` disappears '' is replaced by states appealing to banks or raising taxes , which is what i 've repeated at least three times but you seem not to have the cognitive capacities to understand that european countries could replace an american absence through their own pockets ; that they do n't need to sacrifice this very specific branch , healthcare , to spend more in defense . 
   taxes are taxes regardless of what they are spent on . 
  i advise you to read up on basic economics . 
  i am not sure how this is relevant to what i 've said and i do n't think you know either , sadly . 
   so you say reduce spending . 
  okay , reduce spending on what ? 
  reduced spending in the civilian sector means a lowered quality of life which was my argument in the beginning . 
  reduced spending on military defense would signify the end to nato as the majority of countries that can not afford to be against russia would instead align themselves with russia if there is no one to fund their defense . 
  i was certain you would be going off topic !, 
   we were only discussing about healthcare and healthcare being somehow better or cheaper because of the american presence in europe , which is wrong as you may understand now . 
  if nato disappeared , it would provoke certain instability but not necessarily war against russia . 
  one may argue that it is nato that always puts russia on edge . 
  the eu has an equivalent to article 5 of nato , and the eu is a bit more reliable than the ( current ) united states which is going through an edgy phase . 
  a disppearence of nato would fuel much more a european defense ( which has been heavily discussed inside the eu , especially after brexit but i assume you do n't know about that ) , and mutual cooperation ( which have been going on for decades ) . 
  the eu has been funneling billions of euros to eastern europe for development , and could do as much for armement . 
  i ca n't find how much the us is spending in eastern europe , but it 's certainly not an amount that 27 countries together could n't reach . 
  ( and wikipedia gives only 1,29 billion in spending ... this is nothing . ), 
  my point was that america is not enabling countries to have cheap healthcare because of nato in europe , nothing else . 
  and let 's be honest , this discussion is a bit useless ; the us is never going to let the eu down , and because the healthcare thing is just a downright false argument given by conservative americans who blame europe instead of themselves for having worse healthcare . 
  i agreed that the taxes will increase , but that does n't mean that healthcare will suddenly be unaffordable ? 
  it 's even happening nowadays . 
  so people will pay more and i never denied that at all . 
  but compared to the us or the rest of the world , it will still remain quite low and affordable . 
  do you understand ? 
  the debt solution is not `` raise taxes '' because taxes and debts are two different concepts ? 
  you can increase the debt and reduce spending ( not in healthcare because it 's financed by taxes ... ) in education , justice , welfare , and healthcare remains unscathed , solutions than you are now brushing off again . 
  i advice you read more on healthcare to see how it is financed and how little it is related to defense . 
  the question was universal healthcare as opposed to american healthcare which is different , our discussion never was about price of said healthcare , which would remain low and affordable even in this nato hypothesis situation which will never happen anyway . 
  and you kindly brushed away the debt solution , or the fact the healthcare could be untouched but other department like functionaries , education and welfare could be affected instead of healthcare . 
  and why bother talk about eu politics to someone who knows nothing of it , it 's always talking to wall with people like you . 
  that 's kinda what i implied ? 
  taxes would go up , and the eu would step in . 
  healthcare in this will not be affected , or not much , in all this . 
  you 're implying that taxes would n't simply be increased or the debt increased to finance the potential increase in the defense budget . 
  you have a fixation on healthcare ; and your argument does n't work in countries whose defense rely little on american presence , such as france or britain . 
  their nuclear weapons are enough . 
  your argument is only slightly valid for eastern europe but you do n't have to look closely to understand that it 'd be quite bewildering to think that you are somehow funding their healthcare , because healthcare in eastern europe is not particularly grand . 
  then you have nordic countries that could fit your argument . 
  however , they are wealthy enough to replace an american absence by a european aid , mainly through the uk and france . 
  the only thing that the us does generously for europe ( and the rest of the world ) , is their inability to control prices and pharma companies . 
  the defense budget is provided through taxes as well . 
  you 're the one not making any sense to be honest, 
  healthcare is provided by taxes mainly , not by the money we hypothetically take out of defense, 
  race to the bottom , look it up . 
  because the 120k public jobs cut is not replacing future retirees in territorial collectivities . 
  what ? 
  legislative cooperation is indispensable to carry out the president 's programme . 
  le pen grew up in a literal castle and are millionaires . 
  it 's referring to article 49.3 of the constitution , i 'm on mobile so you could look it up , it 's pretty straightforward . 
  france always had some kind of independent stance on russia , but it never was russophilia . 
  i do n't think france actually has a * philia * for any country . 
  macron was referring to the 90s, 
  well , maybe you can then explain how being third or second in almost all constituencies will somehow make them win seats . 
  yeah , bringing sens commun to the government is such a good idea !, 
  he would 've been a perfect president !, 
  fillonists make me gag . 
  the guy who answered to you was full of bullshit , by the way . 
  you enter the ena through a competitive examination , and of course , names are not given to the jury . 
  currently you have around 45 positions available each year . 
  it used to be around 70 in the 80s , i think . 
  ena alumni are found everywhere in cabinets because the school was created to form high-ranked civil servants . 
  by the way , sarkozy had a grudge againt the ena because he did n't manage to pass . 
  but he still needed them because they have the expertise . 
  i ca n't believe that such disinformation you were given are upvoted that much .

  sens commun is a movement of its own . 
  fillon does n't control it . 
   an end to the 35 `` work '' week no . 
  * [ paris ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/paris_75/ ) * [ lyon ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/rhone_69/lyon_69000 ) marseille and french established abroad still not available, 
  fortunately , corsica was not forgotten . 
  he is the current defense minister ( very well-liked ) , and the current president of the region . 
  it does n't explain everything , but it must have helped a lot . 
  edit : http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/011/092/index.html quite surprising , again !, 
  he is already first , though . 
  old people . 
  provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur is a huge right-wing and far-right r\u00e9servoir . 
  nice is traditionally pro mainstream conservative party ( ump before , lr currently ) . 
  it seems to be in all / r/europe 's mind , not so much in france, 
  maybe / r/europe will be interested in the scores of quite important cities : * [ calais ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/pas-de-calais_62/calais_62100 ) * [ grenoble ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/isere_38/grenoble_38000 ) * [ nice ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/alpes-maritimes_06/nice_06000 ) * [ cannes ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/alpes-maritimes_06/cannes_06400 ) * [ bordeaux ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/gironde_33/bordeaux_33000 ) * [ nantes ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/loire-atlantique_44/nantes_44000 ) * [ strasbourg ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/bas-rhin_67/strasbourg_67000 ) * [ toulouse ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/haute-garonne_31/toulouse_31000 ) we still have to wait for marseille , lyon and paris . 
  hauts-de-seine are still not counted , which i think is a huge fillon r\u00e9servoir . 
  wait and see . 
  http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/presidentielle-2017/044/067/index.html bas-rhin ( alsace ) not voting for fillon , a surprise, 
  fillon = rich christian gaullist right nda = rural gaullist right,
