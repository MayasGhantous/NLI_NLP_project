please lend me your crystal ball , i have a few games i want to bet on . 
   this is wrong to vote for the fn because they do n't even go to the european parliament . 
  they do n't even try to defend their ideas and limit europe 's influence , they just cash the mep salaries and that 's it . 
   so the consequence is that instead of having 74 mep , france will have only 50 . 
  ( actually maybe even less , because the fn mep are not the only ones to ignore their responsibilities ) . 
  this `` argument '' really pisses me off . 
  it 's one thing to not be present all the time when you only have 3 representatives in the eu parliament : your vote pretty much does n't count . 
  now that they have 24 representatives and opportunities to form an actual group , there is no way to tell what they will or wont do . 
  except if you 're some kind of a clairvoyant i suppose . 
  it is if you 're using the ( very convenient for them ) definition of europe put forth by brussels and its supporters . 
  europe is not the eu as it is today . 
  you can be for a certain form of european unity and still be very much against what the eu is today and how it was built . 
  there 's actually no way to verify what was or was n't said . 
  it was n't recorded , it was n't during an official speech . 
  it 's basically second hand `` eyewitness '' testimony . 
  they seem very well documented and supported by many facts . 
  ah but it 's the excuse ( in the quotation marks ) that is `` old '' , not the people . 
  sorry for the confusion !, 
  ah yes , the old `` people do n't vote like i want them to , they must be ignorant '' . 
   many people here try to find something to play down the fact that women suffer more than men in some instances the study is not gender-comparative , there is no evidence coming out of it that says that women suffer more than men . 
  that does n't mean that violence against women does n't exist , it does n't mean that violence against women is acceptable , it just means that this study in no way , shape or form permits any one to say that women do or do not suffer more than men . 
   implying the protests still have anything to do with the eu, 
  the first set was really nice , in touch with europe ( referring to traditions and accomplishments ) and less bland than what we have today . 
  especially like the owl and the stag .

   stay islamofascist a quick look at my post and comment history would have avoided you the embarassment of calling me that . 
   its mostly american and to a large extent economically driven but that 's wrong . 
   jewish defense league mugging does not happen . 
  bullshit right there . 
  [ o ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2010/05/10/mort-du-vigile-la-piste-tenace-du-racisme_625209 ) [ rly ] ( http://www.franceinfo.fr/faits-divers/expeditions-punitives-contre-des-quenelliers-a-lyon-1261031-2013-12-24 ) ? 
   yes jews are deliberately targeted in europe no they 're not . 
   i know its tough and gives a bad feeling inside no it does n't . 
  stay jidf . 
   which receive popular support . 
  look who 's ludicrously exaggerating over here . 
  we 're not going to play `` who 's the biggest victim '' here , but white people get stabbed/mugged/raped for being white ( and yet there is a constant denial of the existence of anti-white racism , despite for example the inflamatory lyrics of popular rappers which actually receive popular support and public funding ) . 
  muslims , non-muslims and other jews have been mugged by the jewish defense league , one of them ( a security guard ) was killed . 
  churches and cemeteries have been vandalized . 
  there is no `` popular support '' for the killing of jews , they are not targeted more than other communities , nor is there `` plenty '' of anti-jewish violence . 
  there have however been hoaxes of said violence ( rer d , tgv , etc. ), 
  7 events recorded for 2013 , 2 involving actual violence . 
   plenty of anti-jew violence define `` plenty '' . 
   plenty of anti-jew violence in france at the moment but that 's a lie . 
  thanks for the replies !, 
  i admittedly do n't know as much as i 'd like about the ukrainian situation . 
  i just thought i 'd seen some pictures of the first line protesters with the [ old party logo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/i%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%8f_n%d0%b0%d1%86%d1%96%d1%97.jpg ) right by an ukrainian flag with a [ tyr rune ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/tiwaz_rune.svg/341px-tiwaz_rune.svg.png ) on it . 
  ah , but there is a difference between provoking conflict because you believe your goals wo n't be achieved peacefully ( which is valid , imo ) and being a government shill . 
  i 'm not going to contradict you on it because i do n't have the appropriate information at hand and you probably know better , but i 'm interested in seeing if he 's actually shilling or just provoking . 
  i was under the impression that * svoboda * were in the first line as well , they are not the same as * brastsvo * right ? 
  ah , and thus the smear campaign against nationalist parties begins . 
  not every protest should be peaceful , and not everyone who matches the state 's abuse of force with violence is a `` provocateur '' . 
  protip : not every protester feels protests should be peaceful . 
  screaming `` provocateur ! '', 
  everytime someone brings violence to the plate when facing the state 's display of force ( and often overuse of said force ) is not going to change that . 
  whilst rocking his dynamo kyiv gloves and his ukraine coloured new balance . 
  ukrainian hools do n't fuck about , and do it in style . 
  except it 's not . 
  it 's not obligatory to accept massive amounts of foreigners inside your country . 
  its probably not even desirable . 
  in fact , a majority of countries do not accept massive amounts of foreigners in their countries . 
  why is europe any different ? 
  hey there 's a statue of chairman mao in the french town of montpellier , so i guess you can pull off anything once you 're in office . 
   why would it matter though . 
  are you seriously asking why it matters that nations do n't want foreigners ? 
  as in the opinion of the nation does n't matter ? 
  is this real life ? 
  a french caritative association dedicated to helping serbian children and people in kosovo . 
  trying to raise serbian support for a french so-called `` extremist agenda '' ( this is still a caritative association we are talking about ) . 
  right . 
  stop being a cunt . 
  if you knew the hard work and personal dedication that goes into organizing these humanitarian trips every year , building a true relationship with the local population and bringing hope and a smile to all these children , on christmas and during the summer , you would n't belittle it with dreadfully commonplace one-liners about `` the far-right '' . 
   free speech and political ideology has its limits , fascism caused the deaths of millions , all measures should be used to stop fascism rising again . 
  free speech and political ideology has its limits , communism caused the deaths of millions , all measures should be used to stop communism rising again . 
  because , until proof of the contrary , he still has popular support and a rag-tag team of dubiously funded terrorists , foreign djihadists and some citizens still have n't managed to upset the balance and overthrow him . 
  being a `` dictator '' does n't make you illegitimate , european standards ca n't and should n't be blindly applied to completely different cultural and political contexts . 
  democracy is not a universal measure of `` good '' or `` success '' . 
  yes , let 's go bomb some more hospitals and schools , kill more civilians , in order to destabilize a legitimate regime we do n't like !, 
   people disagree with me , they must be insane !, 
   in 1999 an italian member of the neo-fascist casapound killed two senegalese . 
  casapound was founded in 2003 . 
  the man who shot the two senegalese was unstable and was not an actual member of casapound . 
  other than that , yes there have been examples of right-wing terrorism , it 's usually the very first conclusion everyone jumps to and tries to push when the victims are extra-europeans ( the merah case in france is a good example ) . 
  however they remain vastly insignificant in europe and are constantly overplayed by the media . 
  according to [ europol figures ] ( http://www.loonwatch.com/2011/11/updated-europol-data-less-than-1-of-terrorist-attacks-by-muslims/ ) the majority of terrorist acts in europe are perpetrated by separatists , then comes the far-left , then much later it 's islamists and far-right . 
  so is israel . 
  what 's your point ? 
   what a ridiculous argument . 
  replying to a string of ridiculous arguments . 
   so you 're saying you have little in common with the average american man too ? 
  i have very little in common with the average american man , i know : i lived there . 
   i 'll freely admit to having more in common with the average american or frenchwoman of today than with the irish man of a hundred - nay , fifty years ago . 
  that 's neither here nor there , of course people have changed over the last 100 years . 
  i still personnally have more in common with a frenchman of 100 years ago , with an italian or even with a russian than i do with an american . 
   also , a frenchman complaining about colonialism and imperialism ? 
  an irishman , not eating potatoes ? 
  all snide , slightly humouristic , remarks aside . 
  i 'm not saying you 're not allowed to enjoy mcdonalds or kebabs once in a while , i 'm saying it becomes a problem when they become the only option for affordable or quick restauration and they obliterate all other local food places ( as it is the case in certain neighbourhoods ) . 
  and i 'm well aware of my country 's colonial and imperial past , i respect it and embrace it as part of my history and identity but i 'm sure as hell not responsible for it nor do i think it 's a desirable course of action which is why i 'm critical of colonialism and imperialism today . 
  no i understand that , and i fully agree with the matter raised by op . 
  israel certainly is n't european .
