it 's just you . 
  i 'm not really new here , but i 'm still surprised about the openness of some attitudes . 
  this guy for example . 
   even actual nazis would probably be disappointed in these neo-nazis . 
  and that takes some doing . 
  your comment :  definitely . 
  muslims ( or muslim nations ) and the nazis were great partners . 
  what 's even the connection between these two sentences ? 
  or are you just trying to say `` dae muslims = nazis !? '', 
  `` everyone who is n't me has an agenda . 
  for my part , i just inform people . '', 
  critical hit, 
  and here we go . 
  / r/forwardsfromhitler, 
  i second you . 
  maybe i was n't active on reddit or internet at this time , but almost every time i see this , there 's no mention of `` american smugness '' this would answer to . 
  it 's always something like '' - and now ameryankees will say they won the war by themselves amirite ?? 
  - dude nobody has said that . 
  - yes they have . 
  report . '', 
  is n't in quite normal taht you would lose to something like faroe islands ? 
  you say it as if it was a national shame , whereas the difference in population is not so huge , considering how many people in luxembourg are eligible to play . 
  right a little east of canada, 
  albanians are also quite friendly , based on my experience !, 
  i understood it as being neutral , more like a list of self-stereotypes than anything ` overpatriotic '' . 
  the part about `` believing to be a worl power '' , for exemple '' . 
  it 's really more of a common french joke , based on mostly cultural differences , cost of life , and especially the perceived arrogance parisians have for anyone else . 
  paris is actually awesome to visit , the historical and cultural stuff there is astonishing , you wo n't find such a concentration of it anwhere in the rest of france . 
  it 's actually a must-go as a tourist . 
  i went there to visit a couple of times , was never disappointed . 
  however , there are awesome places other than paris to visit in france , it just depends what you are aiming for !, 
  smaller cities with a really cool and friendly atmosphere ? 
  a shit ton of them !, 
  awesome food , not that small , and huge culture stuff - lyon/lille . 
  especially lyon for the f\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res ( 8 december ) , if you have the chance to go there , it 's marvelous . 
  awesome food , extremely beautiful cities , strange way of sayin `` chocolate bread '' , rugby passion , funny accent , next to ocean and beaches ? 
  toulouse , bordeaux and their surroundings . 
  moutaaaaaaaains ? 
  ( and extremely rich food ) - grenoble . 
  ( please come here , nobody knows us ) . 
  you want to dawdle around the city while looking at the pictural landscape ? 
  annecy for the mountains/lake within the city , aix-en-provence for its architecture and the famous lavanda fields , strasbourg for its pittoresque houses and historical places . 
  landscapes , hills and rain , with stunning views ? 
  the mont-saint-michel is a must-go as well . 
  sun , alcohol and drunk students in a classical town ? 
  montpellier would suit you . 
  and so on and so on ... you can find basically anything you 'd like if you know what you 're aiming for . 
  as a `` starter '' , i 'd recommend either bordeaux or lyon if you 're into big cities ; or a tour around bretagne and normandie if you 're more into hills , castles & stuff . 
  and grenoble as well , because i 'm biased . 
  did i mention we have mountains ? 
  ^ ^ invest ^ ^ in ^ ^ southern-eastern ^ ^ france ^ ^ pl0x !, 
  tl ; dr : almost everywhere , especially grenoble . 
  nope , you ca n't take just half of it . 
  either the whole thing or nothing . 
  ^ ^ please ^ ^ take ^ ^ the ^ ^ other ^ ^ one ^ ^ too ^ ^ or ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ gon na ^ ^ be ^ ^ soooo ^ ^ awkward, 
  ask everyone there how they feel being french . 
  that should do just lovely . 
  the blood giving part is an awesome idea they had . 
  i really like the symbolism of it . 
  at last , my favorite neighbor has been done !, 
  the competition ( apart from spain ) has n't been that hard though . 
  love from the best alps ,, 
  well , actually no . 
  sorry about that . 
  the thing is i 'm not in a good enough shape to join a normal club . 
  you know , french lungs ... 
  nothing about this beer thing ? 
   not too many just tell me there is a french expats rugby club and i hop in a plane , swallowing haggis on my way, 
  damn , scotland , i want to join you already . 
  been there a couple of times , including a 2-week trip with my then-gf , and i really loved it . 
  i 've got an important question though : how many englishmen are there ? 
  oh okay , good to know !, 
  thanks for answering, 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's part of the joke . 
  but we do n't like parisians either , so it 's fine . 
  on his way back from some remote camping in ard\u00e8che most likely, 
  it 's written in this post , 
   similar to salami fuck whoever wrote this, 
  hollande ft. booba and kaaris - * jte knique , toi & ta clique * produced by * universal music rap * . 
  it 's gon na be soooooo hot, 
  could you send us some football players too ? 
  that 'd be great !, 
  small question here - do you have a french background ? 
  do you speak french ? 
  i 'd be impressed that anyone could grasp most of the humor of these movies without being french on the first place , as most of the jokes revolve on really fench-centered humor ( the ren\u00e9 coty running gag , for instance ), 
  do n't take it badly mate , it 's just a banter . 
  i genuinely love your beers , best in the world imo . 
  the non-country joke is but a teasing , but you 're not really helping yourself on that case !, 
  witty one . 
  how can he `` become '' french if he 's french in the first place ? 
  trying soooooo hard, 
  you shold try it though , it 's really really good . 
  it 's extensively eaten in southern western france . 
  i did not know it was a stereotypical thing in germany , i thought it was a classical meal everyone had ? 
  thank you for using oss 117 !, 
  i do n't think we can have a ` sterotypical * national * dish ' , the food variates so greatly from one region to another that there is no one classical dish available everywhere that i can think of . 
  for my part , i 'm waiting for winter to come back so i can make some * ravioles * and * croziflette * . 
  i like rich food . 
  aaaaah , belgium , you 're my favorite beer-producing non-country . 
  you 're not relevant enough so that people believe you though , sunburnt luxembourg !,
