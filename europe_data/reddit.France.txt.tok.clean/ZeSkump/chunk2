  that bait wo n't work . 
  i wo n't fall for it ... 
  i wo n't ... gnnnn ... nooo ... fuck off pizzaface napoleon real french born in the arms of saint joan of arc herself while you were still licking the toes of the austrians so they could give you some food it doesnt even matter that his family didnt speak french his soul was the forecoming of charles de gaulle the great , the reincarnation of charlemagne in a smaller size !!! 11 !! 1 !, 
  damnit , i failed . 
  he learned how to frown his eyebrows in the most serious way . 
  of course you 'd know that , * horizontal parisian . 
  nothing to add . 
  except maybe one thing : fuck you paris . 
  french countryside real france . 
  you mean / r/rance right ? 
  hollande being swaggy as usual . 
  the pot called the kettle black ... 
   middlesbrough it 's twinned with dunkerque/dunkirk , so i 'm not expecting much of it . 
  rivalry and * casus belli * , obviously . 
  wine is often cheaper than beer in local bars here so ... 
  i guess you 're right about it being cultural !, 
  username checks out . 
  but ... food !, 
  you do n't count , switzerland . 
  you put everyone else to shame , so we 're better off pretending you do n't even exist !, 
  i do n't get why you are being downvoted . 
  good question . 
  let 's hold a referendum . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ oxi ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ? 
  well , at least we tried to . . 
  we 're watching the tv right now , with its awful commentaires . 
  do it to impress a french girl . 
  that would be a good motivation . 
  ( unless all you have is northern french girls , of course . ), 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand i know where to go on holidays . 
  get your snails ready !, 
   eurocost haha nice wordplay wait ... 
   let em discipline themselves  let em see what shortage really means  fix this rotten country . .  i am the devil himself . 
  well ? 
  you sound like such a terrible person . 
   tusk : ` some will say we have an agreekment ' i wonder what 's worse , their difficulties to collaborate or their sense of humor . 
  well it seems africa still has to wait for being free from foreign pressure ... 
  do n't worry , we do n't actually eat these !, 
  we just sell them to tourists and parisians . 
  well then , you seem way above any suspiscion . 
  you should take exemple of your gf . 
  well , do n't forget a true croissant is around 134 % butter . 
  approximatively . 
  shit i hope i have n't hit a bad spot ; if so , i genuinely am sorry . 
  it 's just a common joke in france , when one eats particularly rich food ... and 3 croissants butter-style fit in this category . 
  yep , that 's my point . 
  i did n't mean , ad i do n't believe , that there is sides to be taken as being `` for germany/france/the tro\u00efka '' and `` for greece '' . 
  the side i meant was the will to pursue negotiations at any costs , and it seems to be working so far . 
  i 'm praying for it to continue . 
  i 'm sorry for your diabete , then . 
  same as usual : no matter how good it can be or how worse we can fall , we 'll just complain about something , find a cause to defend , demonstrate and have more or less violent or publics actions about it , then sit back to a caf\u00e9 and find something else to complain about . 
  the worst part is , you kinda grow addicted to it . 
  sadly , i could n't agree more . 
  let 's not forget : greece is not endebted to germany . 
  it is endebted to various institutions , among which are banks from countries in the eurozone , a part of them being german . 
  i 'm sorry but for once i disagree with you . 
  i do n't think it has been taken into account ; the comparison seems a bit vague as well . 
  besides , although it is arguable , the treaty of versailles is not really seen as the one factor for the rise of nazism in germany anymore , especiallly not the debt part . 
  [ attention ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_4czu4ghmo ), 
  italy : `` an open-air museum '' . 
  i never thought about it that way , but it might fit just well . 
  please do n't !, 
  that 's complicated . 
  we do like brits . 
  hard to explain , but most of the french i know even like english individuals , but not english as a people . 
  not to mention their government . . 
  to what is ` yellow press ' referring to ? 
  wait , you rant against the ` liberal ' tone of arte , and then you recommend jouvenel ? 
  that does n't add up . . 
   the same applies to africa . 
  they gave their subjects rights as citizens . 
  it was imperialism , but at least they were guided by post-revolutionary ideals and ideas . 
  eh , i wish it was . 
  to an extent , you could say it was less brutal ( i do n't know much about other colonisations systems , so i 'm not sure about this ) , but that 'd be wrong to say they were n't separation between races among french colonies . 
  even in algeria , that was a direct french department ( and not considered an overseas colony ) , this situation was heavily enforced . 
  see for example the [ * code de l'indig\u00e9nat . * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indig%c3%a9nat ) . 
  remember that even in the 1950-1960s , the metropolitan french government denied the same elective rights for indig\u00e8nes , even though it was at the beginning of the algerian uprising the major demand the majority of algerians supported , instead of independance . 
  well , that 's a fitting username . 
  the viking stereotype is n't relevant anymore , no one really takes that seriously . 
  now , for the blondes ... 
  yeah , i think your username kinda proves it . 
  yeah but who is n't worst than belgium when it comes to beer ? 
  yep , it 's the same word . 
  well , in this case , it is an effort of coherence as * chariot * was unique among the other words coming from the same root . 
  * charrue , charrier , charrette * ... all but * chariot * had two `` r '' , so in the end i 'd say it makes more sense when it comes to writing it . 
  and as for prononciation , apart from peasants from rural berry , i guess it wo n't change anything . 
  it becomes clear with words based on the same origin , often between verbs/adjectives and nouns h\u00f4pital = =  hospitalier ( adj ) fen\u00eatre = =  d\u00e9fenestrer ( verb ) and so on . . 
  i think tennis is higher than handball . 
  and , obviously , rugby in southern france . 
  okay , so we 've got the same opinion . 
  but i somehow assumed you were kinda like vertikal19 and his weird claims , sorry for that . 
  it was absolutely my point that it is totally ridiculous to have border claims based on such outdated period ( especially since it is very likely that at this time , most of the people living in this borders would feel absolutely no common connection , the hre being a perfect example of that ) . 
   and the karling empire =| = france , the franks originates in what is now the benelux/germany/france border region and were neither ` french ' nor ` german ' in the modern sense . 
  8so they were kinda like ... proto-belgians or something ? ), 
  i 'd agree for the first part , but in my mind , in the same way that they 're not french or germans , they 're not belgians either . 
  it makes in my opinion little sense to try and attach to them a nationality that mattered absolutely not at this time . 
  now that 's a ridiculous claim . 
  if we base france 's border on the 9th century , italy 's on the 3rd , and so on and so on , that 's gon na be messed up . 
  hell , it 's like you 're not even acknowledging the existence of nation-states , and the fact that it * might be * overlapping with '' ethnic distributions '' . 
  ( unless you were joking , in which case , well done , i fell for it ),
