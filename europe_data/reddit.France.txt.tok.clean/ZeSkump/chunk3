   so because the german government commited atrocities it is fine to commit similar atrocities against the german population ? 
  the key here is `` similar '' . 
  they were not , by any means . 
  there 's no denying that this forced migrations have been pretty shitty though . 
  but it comes nowhere close to the `` atrocities '' you mentioned earlier . 
  you 're decredibilizing a real issue right now . 
  that was a bad example indeed . 
  i never said they were a majority though , only that there is some , as tangojager said . 
  i was thinking of another famous one , with a breton name , if you can help me . 
  something like le guen or roughly the same ? 
  i would have prefered i did n't happen . 
  as if we have n't had our fair share of '' `` ethnic french '' '' homegrow jihadists . . 
  i do n't know all the names , but people such as olivier corel et al. 
  definitely exist ... 
  yep . 
  we do n't even call them french fries . . 
  i was about to make the changing sides joke , tu me coupes l'herbe sous le pied !, 
  nice french btw, 
  we have this joke for french people ... 
  so much about [ cultural and ethnical ties ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xuuw5/italys_prime_minister_criticizes_merkel_and/cy8vwpd ) , backstabbing brother :(, 
  well you 're tied to us of course !, 
  unlike what the current atmosphere might show , i do believe that historical and cultural similarities do matter as well ( although perhaps not as much as economic relations or such ) in foreign relations . 
  at least does it help to shape the bottom-up agenda setting . 
  then again , i feel ( though i might be wrong there ) , that it depends if op meant holiday or holy-day . 
  as in , as a celebration , christmas is definitely on top , but i 'd say 14th july is above in terms of importance . 
  yeah , do n't worry i figured that , 
  italy is pretty impressive . 
  but which kind of revisionist/anti-jacobine demon drew corsica apart from france ? 
  `` caen '' hahahaha you spelled rouen wrond , camarade . 
  bof bof ... not so great a test . 
  i was seriously expecting better . 
  please , this article is like a giant clickbait . 
  no really , it used to be pretty common in britain too . 
  and in some ways , in france during colonization , although under another form . 
  tl ; dr : eastern & central europe, 
  wait , you 're saying weird things here . 
  constantine was a provocative example , to show it does not make any sense to say `` he way from this city '' , as they have changed throughout the time . 
  and the gauls are our ancestor but franks are n't ? 
  top kek, 
  because the term * badass * annoys me horribly , because these threads is just puking the one or two famous guys has produceed . 
  it does not encourage researching , it just encourages throwing stories and rumors which , in most cases , are not verifiable , about that one guy who were turned into a myth . 
  and it 's basically always the same topic from different countries . 
  `` this french/spanish/portuguese / polish guy , facing imminent death , repelled an attack/stood up against oppression , something that someone else could definitely not have done . 
  that 's not a point though . 
  constantine is not turkish . 
  kinda yes, 
   how can you hope to extrapolate such a definition or concept to 2000 years ago . .  by making such claims that extend to 2000 years ago , a lombardian from milan is not italian . 
  that 's exactly what i do n't understand in your argument : you say you can not apply the definition of nationality to ( i think ) pre-modern people , yet , instead of saying `` we can not say he was or was n't italian '' , you say : `` he was n't '' . 
  however , it is also very likely that i have not been clear in making my point . 
  it is a complex matter to tackle on , especiallu in another language . 
  my points are : 1 . 
  the definition of nationality , and its composants are not universal . 
  they have emerged at different times , for different situations , in different places . 
  example : while the idea that one ought to describe whait it ought to be , say , french , at a time , it does not mean that such an incentive to describe what it means to be , say , scottish or russian existed . 
  the need for a definition appeared in different times and circumstances . 
  it is also linked to point 2 : 2 . 
  the concept and items of what defines a nationality have changed . 
  they have changed in their broader acceptance , and in their specific applications for countries . 
  one again , france provide a useful example : from a conception coming as the status of `` subject of the king ( which engulfs the representation of the state '' , to a political , and individual-centered notion that engulfs cultural and linguistic elements . 
  i think ( but then , it is a personal opinion ) , that it would be wrong to dismiss nationality of individuals that have lived in ancient political systems . 
  of course , the very term of nationality is linked to `` nation '' , but the concept is translates is way older . 
  this is easily seen today , as we do not really have a specific account of what a nation truly is . 
  especially not in comparison to what other items , such as `` people '' ( still in the french example of * peuple * here ) are . 
  so it does not really matter that `` nations '' as such did n't exist `` back then '' , as you said , because the coinage of the term definitely did n't predate the existence of a social structure that would later be called `` nation '' , be it * peuple * , * gens * or whatever . 
  i hope i have made my points clearer this time . 
  thank god , i was worried i was alone in this . 
  that 's actually a brilliant description of it !, 
  not really . 
  the concept of nationality is not a token . 
  it variates according to the nations , and the construction of nations as political entities . 
  see for example the renan/mommsen opposition on frenchness/germanness . 
  a good archetpe of this is the french conception of nationality , which is a political affiliation , and the ( former ) german one , hugely based on ethnic consideration . 
  so it 's kinda hard to discard jc as an italian , assuming that him being or not being italian differs according to the pov and the cultural background of anyone . 
  my point is : for us french , it might seem weird as first to label italian , but it might be totally natural for italians . 
  what defines a nationality is not consensual , even among poli sci academics , let alone can be used to label someone as far as the roman empire , as if the concept of nationality and its background was universally accepted by everyone . 
  she is ^ from ^ ^ poitou ^ ^ ^ though, 
  roughly translated from audiard : `` assholes have no shame , that 's how you recognize them . '', 
  that 's ... 
  i was expecting a more detailed answer on how he is not italian . 
  that reaction is getting cringeworthy . 
  you 've got plenty of your own figured to be hailed ( garibaldi , macchiavelli or dante for instance ) , there 's no need to make some dubious claims about this . 
  i mean , on certain occasions i even read posts from people like `` til napo could not write french '' . 
  about a guy who was legally french , considered himself french , spoke and write french , engaged in the french army , the french state up to the point where he modeled it so as to become the emperor of the french . 
  i still have trouble to understand that people woulc claim that he 's italian , of course other than for the sake of the joke . 
  how so ? 
  you 're thinking about f\u00e9lix faure . 
  but he is mainly known for the joke george `` the tiger '' cl\u00e9menceau made about this event : `` il voulait \u00eatre c\u00e9sar , il est mort pomp\u00e9e '' ( * translated to : he wanted to be caesar , he died pompey/blown * ), 
  god i hate this kind of questions ... 
  please do so, 
  i actually thought the opposite when in germany ? 
  the thing is , they do not even sound like them ... 
  that 's a very good answer . 
  no\u00ebl . 
  and * the local * delivers again . 
  i guess you were right , u/jarvis400, 
  genuine curiosity : did they speak english ? 
  god do i hate these clickbaits titles, 
  some say you can spot the union jack in here . 
  you just need the right amount of absinthe . 
  now that 's a really cool one .
