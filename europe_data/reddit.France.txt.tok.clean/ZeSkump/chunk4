  the best origin imo . 
  if true , it is way better than legends such as the austrians/danish ones or interpretations and speculations . 
  on a mildly-related note , i 'm pretty sure * the local * is the worst kind of newspapers i have seen in terms of quality . 
  could you give an example or mention what kind of shady stuff you 're thinking about ? 
  well , i 'm way less sure i want them out of eu now that it might happen . 
  i feel so bad upvoting you , but i believe you 're right .

  the thing is , although it is a strong stereotype for foreigners that all of france drinks wine regularly , it is n't the case for all frenchmen . 
  in some places , wine is n't the most common local beverage ( beer in north east , cider in the west or pastis in south east for example ) . 
  you can . 
  but it 's a pr operation by ryanair , not something the do for the sake of democracy . 
  well , did n't know that . 
  so i guess it kinda confirms the theory another commenter has made that fries are labeled as ` french ' in some countries based on their cut . 
  i know , i was merely referencing to the frequent debate between kebab/kebap , 
  funniest thing being the fact that everyone in france associates fries with belgium . 
  * arap * is better ? 
  my bad , i fucked up the creation of the link . 
  here 's the article : http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/crise-de-l-euro/article/2015/07/11/les-ministres-francais-et-grecs-se-reunissent-avant-l-eurogroupe_4679642_1656955.html sorry !, 
  for the non-french readers , a rough translation :  '' a bilateral reunion between michel sapin , french finance minister , and its greek counterpart euclide tsakalotos was scheduled this saturday 11/07 , right before the exceptional reunion of eurogroup in brussels to decide the fate of greece . '', 
  so , after the collaboration between both countries for the negociations , the manufcaturing of greek proposals for the summit with the help of french high-ranking civil servants ... now a bilateral just before the eurogroup . 
  it really seems that the french government has picked his side !, 
  rest of the article is precisions about the upcoming eurogroup summit , and the other nes about greece . 
  i can try to translate if you want , but that does not concern the reunion . 
  turkey . 
  i 'm quite fascinated with the history of the country , and the prfound division between identifiable factions of the population amazes me . 
  800 $ a month ?!, 
  you mean a year , or a semester ? 
  though it might not be the same as the `` striped shirt '' previoulsy described , * marini\u00e8res * ( i.e. 
  a striped white and blue , sometimes white and red/black shirt ) are ** very ** ** very ** common in france , both among youngsters and elderly people . 
  the game we play the most with my group of friends is called `` pyramides '' . 
  it might be a big long to explain , but it is worth it . 
  it 's a bluff game . 
  everyone has 4 ( or 6 cards ) . 
  there are a certain number of ` lines ' of cards on the table , each one having one card less than the previous one . 
  all the cardsame are facing down . 
  the first line is worth one sip , the next one 2 , then 4 , then 6 , then a full glass . 
  at the beginning of each round , you reveal one of the cards from the line which is being played . 
  let 's say it 's a 6 of spades . 
  now every player who has a 6 in his hand can give a drink to another player . 
  it goes like `` hey , i 've got a 6 , so you drink one . '', 
  the fun part is that you can lie . 
  which means that the player receiving the sips has 2 choices : - he believes you : he drinks according to the lime you 're currently playing . 
  - he calls you a liar . 
  if so , if you show him your 6 , he drinks twice as much as he was supposed to . 
  but , if you fail to show him the 6 , you drink twice as much a, 
  remove hats when inside , start conversation with a french word , smoke , drink , and complain that `` it used to be so much better '' . 
  it finally pays off to be the biggest leftist around here !, 
  i 'm surprised you have found them anywhere else than in france . 
  but i 'm not surprised you could not grasp the meaning . 
  it 's linked with the far-left groups . 
  * j'existe * ( * i exist * ) is both a joke and a slogan for political action . 
  it 's linked with the very famous tune * r\u00e9siste * from france gall , whose chorus reads * r\u00e9siste !, 
  * [ `` resist !, 
  give the world an proof that you exist ! '' ] . 
  in this way , to be * resisting * is directly linked with existing , you ca n't have one without the other . 
  even among people ( especially younger ) who do not know the song , the lyrics * r\u00e9siste / prouve que tu existes * are universally famous in france . 
  in this way , to write `` j'existe '' is the same as writing `` je r\u00e9siste '' , but it gives a break from the overused political slogans . 
  last thing : i assume it is the case in other european countries , but graffiti and other forms of public writing are absolutely standard in france during demonstrations or protests . 
  additionnally : germans : schleus ( but quite pejorative ) , dutch : semi-schleus potuguese : `` portougu\u00e8sch '' and , as he said , * bouffeurs de pizza * for italians , and so on ... 
  that was a bad thing , but i do n't think fake internet polls will solve anything . 
  never . 
  but then again , caps are quite looked down upon over here , and most of the time assimilated with the `` french chav '' culture . 
  it 's mandatory for middle and high schoolers . 
  which does not mean it 's working . 
  also , just to mention it , you 're not supposed to tip . 
  but if you do it , it will be really appreciated as it 's quite uncommon . 
  so i 'd advise you save it for a really great service . 
  by an incredible margin , edmond rostand . 
  this might be a pretty common opinion , but * cyrano de bergerac * is in my opinion the best piece of litterature i 'll ever have the pleasure to read . 
  the problem is that 's virtually impossible to translate . 
  which is totally the norm for classical french theater , which is way more strict in its construction than its english-speaing counterpart ( the [ classical unities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_unities ) were the must-go , as long as other rules on the rhyms and verses ) . 
  so i hope it answers your question about linguistic barriers . 
  shit , that sucks . 
  did you get a refund ? 
  can you go there without issues now ? 
  do you have any way to contact an embassy/consulate of poland ? 
  what are your countries of nationalities ? 
  here 's a list of faq that might help you : http://www.schengenvisainfo.com/transit-schengen-visa/ it seems that you would fit in this case :  you are coming from a foreign country and are transiting through an airport in a schengen country to travel to another airport in that or another schengen country , what do you do ? 
   as your final destination is a schengen country , it means that you will be entering the schengen zone , if not at the first airport than at the last , therefore you will be requested an entry and short stay visa -- `` c '' category for the schengen area . 
  in this case a transit visa is useless since you will be leaving the international transit area of the airport at some point in the schengen zone . 
  good luck and please keep us informed !, 
  france : every party except for the trio republicans ( former-ump ) , udi ( center ) , and '' '' '' '' `` socialist '' '' '' '' '' paty . 
  albeit these have , at best , a more than timid support to offer to nato . 
  but we 've got a part of a mountain inside the city though, 
  that 's a tough one ... on one hand , i do n't think it would be very convenient to board your bikes in trains , or completely impossible in some cases ( most international trains for example ) . 
  on the other hand , i do n't see how you could rent a bike for such a long time , and for so many countries ( being different insurances and such ... ) . 
  i think the best for you would be to rent your bikes in each country you 're visiting , with exceptions for the neighbouring countries that allow bike transportions on trains . 
  however , that remain conditioned by the eurorail thing . 
  which does not apply everywhere ( uk for example ) . 
  quick look on this seems to say that the best way would be to buy foldable bikes , which appear to be carried for free in most trains . 
  you should double check that though . 
  good luck !, 
  poorly . 
  which country ? 
  switzerland ? 
  since no italian has showed up yet : wine . 
  ^ ^ althoug ^ ^ i ^ ^ do ^ ^ like ^ ^ italian ^ ^ wine,

  you can always put spices in a * saut\u00e9 \u00e0 la tomate * , for example .
