  mainland france would have been invaded and subjected to threats and so on , but that 's precisely what the defeat and occupation meant either way . 
  p\u00e9tain personally stopped those plans and threatened to assume power and condemn the rest of the government as traitors and desertors if they retreated to algiers . 
  when he got full powers he did n't consider this option , not even theoretically to negociate his deal with the nazis , he simply capitulated to everything ; then he did nothing to prevent the nazis from seizing the navy , forcing the brits to bomb it , which he blamed on them . 
  even if there was no way to fight back at the time , it does n't mean france had to sign anything . 
  what did the polish , dutch , belgian , etc. 
  governments did ? 
  they did n't concede defeat and recognize the nazis ' authority , they formed governments-in-exile . 
  at least they avoided the dishonour of having their legitimate government ( and in most cases , any native government at all ) working for the nazis . 
  and it is not british propaganda to say that we betrayed czechoslovakia and poland , that we did n't actually attack germany , and that this `` defensive '' strategy was pretty much sure to fail since the maginot line did not cover the entire border . 
  so yes , france could have fought wwii very differently . 
  what order ? 
  i thought about ranking from most left-wing to most right-wing , but i did n't know where to count alde , so i just ranked them by country code . 
  for some reason the order was reversed . 
  it 's currently , i just did it myself . 
  [ ** edit : here is another version , ranked by most right-wing to most left-wing state ** ] ( http://imgur.com/q00vyvy ) ** efdd-enf : ** euroskeptic `` national-populists '' , far-right ** ecr : ** euroskeptic right ** epp : ** center-right , christian-democrats ** alde : ** liberal-democrats ** pes : ** social-democrats ** egp : ** environmentalists ** gue-ngl : ** democratic socialism , eco-socialism , communism , far-left only the lower house was considered . 
  the efdd and enf groups were fused because they are similar and the member parties fill the same spot in the political spectrum , so that a country generally has one party member of one of those , but none for the other . 
  so it made more sense to put them together . 
  most national political parties belong to a european party or group , but for the few exceptions i grouped them with the closest ideological equivalent . 
  ( i guess a couple of choices could be contestable , for instance the green agrarians of latvia ranked with greens , to which they 're affiliated , even though they 're conservative . 
  but for the overwhelming majority there is no problem . ), 
  la linea was awesome . 
  it makes me wonder ... 
  does any other country got [ the shadoks ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct2hy9pcfri ) it was an old absurd cartoon about stupid nonsensical birds called the shadoks ( representing the french ) who competed with an alien species of super-intelligent bulls called the gibis ( representing the anglos ) . 
  they only know four words ( ga , bu , zo , meu ) and spend their time pumping on giant pumps with no effect . 
  some of their famous precepts include : `` why make it simple when you can make it complicated ? 
  '' , `` the more it fails , the more it is likely to work in the future '' , `` there is no truth , including this one '' , `` if you do n't know where to go , run there as fast as you can '' , `` with a stairway designed for going up you can often end up climbing up lower than you would have with a stairway designed for going down '' , and `` if there is no solution , then there is no problem '' . 
  people could say that moving to a direct election of the president was made precisely to turn turkey into a semi-presidential system as well . 
  though you 're right , it does n't fit with the president having to resign from his party . 
  all the things you listed are the traditional powers of a head of state even in parliamentary systems ( except the extraordinary powers but they have n't been used in over 50 years ) . 
  what i meant about the president not having much powers legally is that according to the constitution he is not supposed to govern or even give instructions to the government , which `` determines and conducts the nation 's policies '' independently of the president . 
  as i explained , the reason france is pretty much an elective monarchy is because when the pm is of the president 's party , he submits to his will and simply executes the policies decided by the president . 
  is n't it one new bill every year ? 
  same as in france : the president does n't legally have much power , but if he is considered to be the true leader of the ruling party , and if he can appoint and fire the pm as he wants , then he can also demand him to do whatever he wants . 
  the pm can only really be free if he has the support of parliament * against * the president . 
  in the case of turkey , since the akp lost its majority and other parties hate erdogan , maybe the pm could benefit from that . 
  how would that be any fair for the lenders ? 
  they would receive more federal money . 
  why do you start claiming others are wrong and armchair scientists if you do n't want to discuss it ? 
   the eu must bear some of the responsibility for turkey 's current situation let me think ... no . 
  so you 're admitting you 're just talking out of your ass and that you have no clear definition of ethnicity ? 
  i gave you dozens of arguments explaining why this concept is unscientific , while you assumed it was something objective and that those trying to say that austrian was a distinct ethnic group were `` armchair scientists '' . 
  i 'm just reminding you that none of this is scientific to begin with . 
  and indeed you do n't know much about ethnology if you think it has a solid scientific basis for the notion of ethnicity or that it cares about dividing the people of europe into `` objective '' ethnic groups . 
  ethnology studies the customs of non-industrialized people . 
  anthropology studies all aspects of humanity , and as i tried to explain , it goes deeper into the mechanics of identity than just categorizing people into definite ethnicities ; in the same way , biological anthropology explains the genetic variations of human populations more rigorously and scientifically than just dividing them into definite races . 
  the concept of ethnicity should not be taken seriously from the start . 
  it has no clear definition and mixes race * , ancestry , culture , language , self-identification , etc. 
  into one category . 
  it pretends that people have only one line of ancestry , instead of more than a thousand at just the 10th generation . 
  it also pretends that it is innate and that you ca n't change your ethnicity , even though culture , language and self-identification definitely are changeable . 
  ( * the concept of race also has quite similar problems ), 
  i do reject the concept of ethnicity . 
  ethnology does n't always use it in the same way as here . 
  any actual argument instead of just saying `` read up on it '' ? 
  current situation as part of a federal europe where borders are mostly meaningless and regions have as much autonomy as possible , so that the question of independence is just irrelevant . 
   call me a coward like your words mean something to me . 
  so edgy . 
   what am i not allowed to say ? 
  you just gave the answer one post above : that a polish immigrant is scum and should leave the country . 
   we however are of the opinion that an imam calling out to kill the infidels or some neonazi gang leader calling out to kill the muslims/brown people both belong in jail . 
  once again : this is also the law in the us , and not the topic of the article at all . 
  the problem is not that many european countries ban calls to murder , but that they ban offensive speech . 
  inciting to murder or violence is a thing , insulting or offending people is an other . 
  in one case you ban people from indirectly and voluntarily causing physical harm to others ( which is banned in the us as well and noone complains about that ) , while in the other you ban opinions . 
  and as soon as you open the pandora box of banning opinions , you have people trying to ban any opinion they do n't like . 
  elected by who ? 
  the sentence is normally of one year in prison ( three years if it was racially or religiously motivated ) . 
  if the perpetrators are 13-16 they can get up to half of that jail time ( so six months ) , and if they 're 16-18 up to the full sentence . 
  however the most probable would be that they 're sent to a closed education center for young delinquants . 
  plus a pretty heavy fine of course , and community service . 
  i 'm sorry but what exactly would be a definition of ethnicity that is more than `` armchair science '' ? 
  the concept itself is extremely flawed , with no real definition , even less an objective one , and generally used to push an agenda . 
  croats , serbs , etc. 
  are one yugoslavian ethnic group when people push for the creation of a single state , but then they are different ethnic groups when they push for independent states . 
  alsacians are german when germany wants to annex alsace , and eastern ukrainians are russians when russia wants to expand . 
  what defines ethnicity ? 
  how do you tell who is ethnically what ? 
  some people in this thread claimed that all germanic people were one ethnicity , others would say flemish are their own ethnic group . 
  some say that it is based on language . 
  everyone in france speaks french , are they not all of the same ethnicity ? 
  some others would say it is blood , and define ethnicity as a sort of sub-racial group . 
  well if you go there you 'd need to use actual genetic science and objective categories like haplogroups instead of names of nations or arbitrary criteria like `` he 's black , he ca n't be a * real * x '' . 
  but haplogroups divide populations in a way that does n't fit any agenda , so of course we do n't use them . 
  then there are others who say ethnicity is just a subjective cultural identity . 
  well that 's fine and if it 's subjective it explains why it 's so difficult to draw borders . 
  but if you accept that ethnicity is based on people 's cultural identity , you ca n't also pretend it 's something you ca n't change , and you ca n't exclude someone from an ethnicity because of his ancestry . 
  so you ca n't either decree that x % of some country 's population is a foreign ethnic group because of their ancestry . 
  you 'd have to ask people : `` do you feel french/italian/german / etc. ? '', 
  and if they say yes then they are . 
  people who use the concept of ethnicity just try to mix race , ancestry , culture , language , etc. 
  into a single category to push their political agenda of ethnic nationalism . 
  they try to pass off cultural bonds as something objective and innate , even though by definition they are precisely not that . 
  yes , it seems someone decided that french people 's definition of who is french is less important than his own made-up one . 
  still it would be more natural for us to distinguish between white french , black french , etc. 
  as a descriptive term rather than to declare that there are only 84 % ethnic french and that the others are actually foreigners , as the map does without explaining at any time what it means by ethnicity and where the number comes from . 
  good . 
  better late than never . 
  also fuck spiegel for making hollande look even goofier than he actually is .
