  especially under sarkozy who tried all he could to surf on anti-muslim feelings . 
  besides , we have private polls and srveys to answer our questions  what 's going on in france ? 
  there are around 5 million `` muslims '' ( ~ 7.5 % ) if you mean people of muslim origins , though many are not really religious , or muslim at all . 
  with that same definition , islam could reach at most 10 % by 2050 , if we disregard secularization and assume immigration from north africa does n't decline . 
  so why are there so many muslims in prison , you would ask ? 
  well for the same reasons there are so many black people in prison in the us . 
  it 's not the kids from the old french catholic families who end up burning cars ; and even though it 's comprehensible , the police obviously controls and arrests far more non-whites , especially for drug crimes . 
  combined with that is the fact that muslims in prison prozelitize * a lot * to other inmates . 
  the 70 % you 're talking about include plenty of converts and re-converts who were not really muslim or not muslim at all before going to jail . 
  that 's a big debate we have in france , how to deal with the spread of islam ( and especially radical islam ) in prisons . 
  we do n't know if we should separate the radical preachers from the rest of the prisoners and pack them in the same containment zone , or if on the contrary we should spread them to avoid them from building a terrorist network together . 
  ** reminder : ** the european court of human rights is not related to the eu ; it is an independent court established in the 1950s by the council of europe , and it has jurisdiction over the entire continent , including russia and turkey , with the only exception of belarus . 
  however , the court 's decisions have no automatic effect on legislation . 
  all they do is sentencing the states to pay a fine and a reparation to the people whose rights have been infringed . 
  so it does n't mean that gay turks will be able to get married this evening . 
  what it means , though , is that all gay couples in countries without ssm or civil unions will be able to sue their state before the echr , which can give some pretty big incentive to change the laws . 
  another thing to consider is that national and eu courts generally consider the echr to be the supreme authority to interpret the 1950 convention that they are all bound to respect . 
  so if the echr says that the convention gives a right for same-sex couples to have access to legal partnerships , it is very possible that other courts will follow . 
  ** countries that are concerned by this decision : ** italy , poland , lithuania , latvia , slovakia , romania , bulgaria , greece , cyprus , serbia , bosnia , montenegro , macedonia , albania , ukraine , moldova , russia , turkey , azerbaijan , armenia , georgia . 
  perfect example of the kind of things i was talking about . 
  yes , that 's what i refered to by `` badly conceived business plan '' . 
  the myth says people rejected his ideas because they thought the earth was flat . 
  in reality , they rejected it because they knew pretty well how big the earth 's circumference was , since ancient time ( eratosthenes ) . 
  yep . 
  entrepreneur asks several european countries to fund his start-up , but fails because of his badly conceived business plan . 
  one country does and eventually gets huge dividends out of it . 
  first time is crimea war i suppose ? 
  they mostly have interpreters who speak many different languages , so it reduces that number ; but yes that is the idea . 
  it sounds ridiculous but on 500 million people you can find someone who speaks both maltese and finnish . 
  as he said , what the hell ? 
  that 's a legal requirement and maltese is an official language of the eu . 
   it got an amazing view of the city . 
  yes it does , but as we say , it 's because when you 're up there you ca n't see it anymore . 
  it 's not complicated : build skyscrapers all at the same places , to make a nice business district ( like la d\u00e9fense ) . 
  do not build skyscapers in or near historical centers where they would ruin the landscape ( like the disgusting montparnasse tower we have n't destroyed yet ) . 
  modern architecture is not bad in itself , what is bad is mixing styles without coordination . 
  hausmanian buildings are not that beautiful , but when you have whole avenues and neighbourhoods built in this style it looks amazing . 
  when i lived in canada i realized that the cities looked like shit even though many buildings were architecturally very nice - it 's just that there was absolutely no coherence between them , you had an english-like individual house next to a concrete building next to a neo-gothic church next to a conceptual post-modern building in glass next to a supermarket . 
   according to census of india of 2001 , india has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages . 
   the eighth schedule of the indian constitution lists 22 languages , which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition , status and official encouragement . 
  in addition , the government of india has awarded the distinction of classical language to tamil , sanskrit , telugu , kannada , malayalam and odia . 
  how does it matter that it 's a german company ? 
  it does n't depend on the german government , and it is still the greek government 's job to make sure it pays its taxes . 
  but op describes himself as an unorthodox progressive muslim who rejects the hadiths , which is awesome in my opinion , but is also contrary to the overwhelming majority of muslims . 
  it wo n't really teach us much unfortunately . 
  my question is : how does it matter to us what * you * believe , when the overwhelming majority of muslims both in the world and in europe are not quranists like yourself ? 
   it would effectively turn the entirety of europe into ** switzerland ** , people in the same country would n't even understand each oter ftfy . 
  there are countless multilingual countries and they 're not like kosovo . 
  it means europe would work * as * a federal state ( with a democratic eu government , eu army , etc. ), 
  but in law be the union of sovereign nation-states with their own constitution , head of state , etc. 
  and full possibility to secede . 
  no , there 's no reason why . 
  there are lots of federations where federated states have a monarchy . 
  besides , european federalists rarely dream of europe as a country in which the uk would be a mere region . 
  it 's more about making the eu work * as * a federation and have the powers and competences of a federation , but it does n't mean the member states would stop being sovereign nation-states in law . 
  that 's even more apparent when they use the phrase `` federation of nation states '' . 
  the real threat of a federal europe to the british monarch is that of precedence and prestige . 
  for instance , if the federation was headed by a ceremonial emperor , the queen would pretty much be his vassal . 
  you all know hollande and it 's about prime ministers , so i 'll talk about our pm ** manuel valls ** . 
  he 's a spanish ( catalan ) born immigrant who fled franco 's regime with his parents and was naturalized french at his majority . 
  very young he gets involved in politics , supporting the socialist party 's center-left , liberal faction , under former pm michel rocard , who hires him as a councillor for the youth . 
  he progressively climbs the steps of his carreer in the party , gets elected mayor of evry ( a popular town in paris suburb ) in 2001 and becomes a more prominent figure in the party , though still considered a junior politician . 
  he 's famous for his political line which is often contrary to the entire rest of the left-wing : he 's economically liberal ( in the european sense ) , pro-austerity , vocally patriotic , tough against criminality , relatively tough on immigration , and has no tolerance for radical islam which he calls `` islamo-fascism '' . 
  he has a very direct and `` no-bullshit '' style , cares a lot about his image in the media and always try to appear as the tough , unflexible guy . 
  all of this pushes people to compare him to sarkozy , calling him the sarkozy of the left . 
  though they also question whether he 's left-wing at all , since his positions are most of the time closer to the conservative parties ' than to his own . 
  he ran for president in 2012 but only received 6 % of the votes in the primary . 
  he did n't expect to win against hollande , but he got humiliated by arnaud montebourg , another junior politician who ran on a leftist platform and got three times as many votes . 
  so when hollande was elected , he appointed valls as minister of the interior and montebourg as a sort of minister of industry with unclear prerogatives . 
  the pm was a senior politician and friend of hollande , jean-marc ayrault , who followed hollande 's moderate line . 
  but valls is an ambitious man , so he plotted from the inside in a way that could be featured in house of cards . 
  he used the political scandals , as well as the conflicts and contradictions between montebourg ( leftist ) and the rest of the government ( moderate ) to show that the pm had no authority and could n't lead his troops ( meanwhile he kept showing in the media how much authority he had in comparison ) . 
  then he allied with montebourg and other junior ministers against the pm and they forced hollande to fire him and appoint valls instead . 
  valls was appointed as prime minister and he made a first government with montebourg not only as minister of industry but of the economy , and several other leftist ministers getting important positions . 
  as valls was considered to be right-wing by a large part of his party he needed to balance and give some concessions to be approved by parliament . 
  but then obviously the leftist ministers opposed his politicial line and caused as much trouble as under the previous pm . 
  valls only waited for that ; instead of bowing down he fired all the leftist ministers , saying they disrespected the government 's discipline , and replaced them with liberals . 
  he lost support from the left fringe of his party , but the parliament eventually backed him and he got full control of government . 
  now he is even arguably quite independent from hollande . 
  i guess i kinda like him , relatively to most other politicians we have . 
  he 's honest , realist , and tries to address the issues of immigration and national identity but without insulting minorities or trying to bait racist voters as sarkozy did . 
  although he has a quite dark side in that he has authoritarian tendencies . 
  not all of it is for the show . 
  he promotes the most intrusive anti-terrorist laws and does n't really like the idea of free speech . 
  flamby is not pm . 
   `` it [ france ] was a country that embraced everyone and encouraged freedom in every way , shape or form -- artistic expression of freedom ... now that 's completely gone . ''  the pop icon added that france was once a country `` that accepted people of color , and was a place artists escaped to , whether it was josephine baker or charlie parker . '', 
  is she seriously saying that tolerance and artistic freedom were greater when there actually was censorship , and when emile zola was called a `` pornographer '' and drawn as a shit-eating pig , then harrassed and ( presumably ) murdered ? 
  that antisemitism is greater now than at the time , when there were many overtly antisemitic newspapers , an antisemitic group in parliament , when the prime minister was casually booed by the right-wing mps calling him a dirty jew , rather than now when antisemitic attacks prompt people to demonstrate in solidarity ? 
  that black artists had it better when they were considered an exotic attraction and danced clothed with bananas , rather than now when they 're topping the charts all the time ? 
  that we were more accepting of people of colour during the age of colonialism when most of them had almost no rights than now in a multiracial society ? 
  and who would be supposed to buy them ? 
   what he 's saying is that the principles of the monetary union follow closely those of the d-mark sure , that 's perfectly true . 
   with the countries pegging their currency to the d-mark getting a seat at the table . 
  and it changes a lot of things when those additional countries make up 70 % + of that zone 's economy . 
  if we are to debate economics , the principle of central bank independence and focusing on inflation is very well supported . 
  besides in real life and regardless of its mandate , the ecb * does * have an expansionist policy at the moment to try and boost growth . 
  its rates are practically as low as they can be . 
  its deposit rate is even negative . 
  if instead of the euro we had all a peg with the d-mark , the bundesbank would have * increased * those rates because of germany 's growth , and the recession would be much worse in the other countries . 
  yes , they can devalue their nominal wages .
