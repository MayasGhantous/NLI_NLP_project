  why are they begging then ? 
  legally yes , no problem . 
  politically , though , if big countries especially germany oppose it , they could easily put a lot of pressure to stop it or impose some conditions . 
  however the thing is that reunification of romania and moldova is not something you can do like that without preparation or a transitory period . 
  it would mean that all romanian laws ( and therefore eu laws ) should apply to moldova , and that 's precisely what we would ask from moldova if it tried to enter the eu in its own right . 
  so either moldova first makes all the reforms necessary to join romania , which would be the same as making those reforms to join the eu ; or moldova joins romania immediately but there is some transitory period to adapt the law and so on . 
  in this second case , the eu could complain that its laws are not respected in a part of romania . 
  but i think it would n't be a problem , because there already are territories belonging to member states but which are considered to be out of the eu . 
  moldova could temporarily be one of these . 
  he should have let the people decide during the referendum , instead of asking them about a proposal that was already out of the table and promising that greece would keep the euro no matter what . 
  it should have been clearly : a ) accepting the troika 's plans , or b ) leaving the euro . 
  tsipras tried very hard to get concessions and that 's great , but he ca n't force other countries to give him money against their will . 
  so he should have been honest and presented the alternative clearly to the people so that they could decide what to do like responsible adults . 
  now instead of that , we 'll have a lot of drama and eventually it 's pretty likely greece will be forced to leave the euro anyway , but overnight , without democratic mandate , and without any preparation , only leading to chaos . 
  that 's sad . 
  * gens du voyage * is a legal category referring to all people with a nomadic lifestyle , among whom roma are a minority . 
  he 's the only one who claims his group was made to `` counter anti-muslim feelings '' . 
  it was very clearly an islamist group of which he was the emir . 
  the title is pretty biased then ; when i read it i thought that the leader of the ccif ( the * actual * anti- `` islamophobia '' group ) had been arrested and convicted . 
  * that * would have been funny . 
  wait a minute , that was not even supposed to be law in the first place , then ? 
  just a resolution . 
  it 's incredible how much the media ( esp . 
  british tabloids ) can imagine completely fictious stories about the eu , and noone seems to care about their dishonesty :  `` a ** mep ** proposed a vague ** amendment ** to one part of a mere ** resolution ** , which said that ** commercial ** reproduction of ** private works of art ** should be limited . 
  this gets widely rejected , as predicted . '', 
  somehow becomes  ** `` the eu bureaucrats want to outlaw your touristic selfies !, 
  fortunately thanks to your righteous outrage and this hero , your fundamental rights are preserved ... for now '' **, 
  even without judging on the content , that was really stupid to focus on those issues if that was just to say the exact same things as the greens . 
  are you saying varoufakis had no legitimacy as greek minister of finances , despite being appointed by the prime minister and part of the government backed by a majority in parliament ? 
  a minister is not a bureaucrat , he is one member of the government , which you admit is the representative of the people . 
  but even the actual civil servants and bureaucrats appointed by the government are perfectly legitimate . 
  they did n't appoint themselves to their position , you know . 
  if they are illegitimate because they were not directly elected , then what about policemen or teachers ? 
  yeah , representatives of a democratic government are `` unelected bankers '' . 
  indirectly . 
  in some countries , government members even have to be directly elected mps . 
  what does the absence of minutes have to do with legitimacy ? 
  the eurogroup is a meeting of ministers from democratically elected governments . 
  each minister is accountable to his own government . 
  all dead :d, 
  you would n't believe how gay la manif pour tous was . 
  i think that to some extent they did it on purpose , wearing pink shirts or bunny costumes , [ making weird conceptual art performances while wearing a spandex costume ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xuk603_la-mise-en-scene-ridicule-des-opposants-a-l-adoption-pour-tous_fun ) , and so on . 
  and of course showing proudly their fake association of gay people against gay marriage . 
  how so ? 
  all it takes is political will . 
  tsipras called to vote ` no ' and said he would resign if the yes wins , which is the thing to do when you lose the people 's support . 
  but of course if it 's schulz or anyone else more or less related to the eu saying this , it 's a scandalous attack against greek democracy . 
  no guys , schulz is not going to send the eu-police kick tsipras out . 
  he 's just stating his opinion and commenting on news , exactly as * you * do . 
   vladimir zhirinovsky are we supposed to take that clown seriously ? 
  i had a good laugh reading his wikipedia article . 
   by contrast , a no vote would at least open the possibility that greece , with its strong democratic tradition , might grasp its destiny in its own hands . 
  greeks might gain the opportunity to shape a future that , though perhaps not as prosperous as the past , is far more hopeful than the unconscionable torture of the present . 
  haha , what a brilliant economic plan , mr. economist !, 
  krugman is more consistent , though , and he 's pretty right in his analysis , but he did n't realize something : voting yes means nothing since the deal is over anyway ( imf ca n't lend anything anymore to greece now that it defaulted ) , and voting no means nothing since tsipras promised it wo n't mean greece leaves the euro . 
  i wish the greeks would have been presented a fair and real choice : either the troika plan , or leaving the euro , which as krugman says would n't be that dramatic . 
  in my opinion both plans are equivalent , since the first is internal devaluation , and the second is monetary devaluation ; both would hurt the people 's purchasing power the same . 
  but at this point the greeks definitely need to choose between those two options , rather than keep dreaming about the eu pouring free money on them , as tsipras and apparently stiglitz think it will . 
  russia can not invade the baltics , they are part of nato and any attack would automatically mean war with the us . 
  this talk about not recognizing their independence is just a move to claim their situation is the same as crimea 's or south ossetia 's . 
  could n't agree more . 
  ah , thanks . 
  i 'm sorry , but what do you mean by drafts ? 
  the dictionaries i used do n't have any meaning related to ac or wet hair . 
  is there something i missed ? 
  the date of 1925 is interesting . 
  most people do n't know this but at that time streseman the german minister of foreign affairs was working with the french pm aristide briand not only on easing relations , but on building `` a federal european union '' . 
  their first draft project was presented and approved by 27 european countries . 
  it called for free trade , a customs union , free movement of people , transfer mechanisms to help the poorer regions to develop , a basic set of social regulations , etc. 
  it 's comprehensible that tsipras wants to shift the decision to the people so that he does n't lose face . 
  but if he publicly calls to vote no , and they vote yes , he loses his legitimacy as leader . 
  i 'm not sure that is what he wanted . 
  and if the people vote no , he would be in an even worse dilemma , because there is little chance the troika will propose anything very different from what 's on the table . 
  either he accepts a very slightly amended proposal , which would betray the will of the voters , or he leaves the eurozone , which would betray his own words , his electors and the referendum voters . 
  at first i thought it was just a move by syriza to accept the deal without losing face . 
  now if people vote yes , tsipras will pretty much lose his legitimacy as pm , an if they vote no , it would not be a clear mandate to leave the eurozone , it would n't say anything , just go back to square one . 
  * that * would be completely useless . 
  that 's completely stupid then . 
  noone cares how much the greeks support tsipras , he could have 100 % and the negotiation would n't be any different . 
  and those negotiations are over anyway , so they 're completely delusionnal . 
  either the greeks accept the last proposals or there will be no bailout . 
  and if there is no payment they will have no choice but to get out of the euro and print their own money . 
  it 's normal to let the people decide , but if they feed them with complete bullshit , how is the vote supposed to mean anything ? 
  if they vote `` no '' that would not be a mandate to leave the euro , it would mean nothing at all ... 
  yes , it is france that goes around slaughtering syrian rebels and beheading infidels . 
  we 're really sorry , but we obviously did n't have a choice , our current situation is ultimately caused by the romans and their gallic provinces . 
  we currently take as little refugees as possible because given the backlash against the past decades ' immigration waves , we think it is better to wait and improve the socio-economic integration and cultural assimilation of the people who are already here . 
  we already welcome a lot of immigrants for other reasons ( family reunion for instance ) , and we already have enough problem convincing people * born and raised in our country * not to commit islamist attacks . 
  how is it surprising that we do n't really want to invite even more people , who not only are muslims , but who contrary to regular migrants had no real will to become french in the first place , meaning they most likely do n't even speak the language or share any of our values ? 
  taking refugees is obviously a nice thing to do , but it is just as hosting a homeless person in your house for as long as he needs and possibly forever . 
  it is perfectly understandable why you would not want to do it . 
  does n't the greek government ask people to * accept * the document ? 
  when did they call people to vote no ? 
  simple , it is * never * your fault  just wait until someone tries to help you then you can blame everything on him . 
  let 's not forget that the entire issue was that according to greeks they could not concede anything more and they had hit their limit . 
  i know people are quite dumb but if their purchasing power keeps getting even worse because of inflation , i guess they will notice it and not react nicely . 
  i love the lyrics by schiller , and [ the musical theme arranged by karajan that is used as anthem of europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) , but the whole beethoven version is just painful to listen , with long moments that have nothing melodious at all , and some of the most ridiculous traits of opera singing . 
  by the way , there is also [ this latin version written to serve as an eu anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_mefzb4yzk ) , if you 're interested . 
  but it * is * stupid . 
  not only the ecb has no mandate to give any money to greece , but the treaties normally forbid it .
