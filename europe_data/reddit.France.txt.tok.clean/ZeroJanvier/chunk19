  well , at least our two-rounds system is still better than fptp ... 
  i do n't think it is supposed to `` keep the extremes out '' . 
  out of germany , extremist parties have no problem getting more than 5 % . 
  it 's rather a way to weed out the candidates that have absolutely no chance to get past that treshold , and to make coalitions easier by limiting the number of parties in parliament . 
  in the same way in france to run for president you need 500 signatures of mayors/representatives/etc . 
  it never stopped extremists of all kind from running but it manages to keep the number of candidates under 15 or 20 rather than having hundreds of unknown weirdos . 
  there 's also a 5 % treshold in order to get your campaign expenditures reimbursed by the state . 
  in israel the treshold used to be 1 % , so any movement hoping to possibly get 1 % presented a list . 
  the result is a complete mess of a campaign , a completely scattered parliament and difficult coalitions with one-seat parties . 
  approval voting would be great for a presidential election , to have a consensual and popular head of state . 
  but for parliament ? 
  it would only make people shut down each other 's opinions rather than let everyone express their own . 
  it 's obviously the best out of those listed but you can do much better than germany . 
  switzerland , for instance , is already far more democratic and open without being any less stable . 
  sorry if that 's a repost . 
  i just saw it in the news and it deserved to be shared , so i checked the new posts for ` berlusconi ' and did n't find it . 
  i actually do n't know anything about genshiken nidaime . 
  yes it is , do n't worry . 
  as far as i know the us does n't `` distribute migrants '' to its states . 
  the entire notion is completely ridiculous , and is not even in the interest of the migrants themselves . 
  i 'm a european federalist but i do n't understand why people expect the eu to be even more intrusive and centralized than actual federal states . 
  poland is the fastest developing european country and did n't even experience any recession during the crisis ( while france is still stagnating ) . 
  also korea got free market economy and foreign investment almost 50 years before poland , that 's not developing `` faster '' . 
  putting a cap on price will not increase the supply of housing in the ` hip ' parts of the city ( on the contrary , if it 's less profitable it means less incentive to build ) , and will increase the demand ( since it 's cheaper ) . 
  how in hell is it supposed to fix the issue ? 
  we also have black mps since 1792 . 
  i do n't know what 's more cringeworthy : that our president is incapable of wearing a tie correctly , or that there is an entire website of people collecting every single picture of him and judging if he wears his tie correctly . 
  if only that was in the 80s ... that was only 10 years ago . 
  and other politicians of the same generation are barely any better at english , they just try to avoid speaking it at all . 
  [ you mean you did n't see the anti-gay marriage bunny ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjf4x6djqdi )  why are you wearing a bunny costume ? 
   well , uh , to show that , uh , i am a. . . dad who , for my children , uh , is able to put some ears on , and , uh , to witness that we are a * happy * couple , * straight * couple , happy , uh , to be * normal * parents , in a normal republic . 
  i guess noone should be surprised to see wtf stuff in an anti-gay demonstration led by one woman married to her cousin and another famous for singing [ `` make love to me with two fingers '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjlsthox4wu ) . 
  greece does ** not ** prepare to exit the euro . 
  also once again they chose the ugliest possible coin design , with once again badly drawn stickmen figures . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  [ they copied belgium , it seems ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/this-hotel-in-belgium-is-shaped-like-a-giant-anus ), 
  his comeback was unanimously considered to be a failure , noone really cared about it and he did n't evolve at all since his defeat . 
  he easily managed to take the party 's presidency though , because the militants were already hardcore supporters . 
  but for the actual election it will be more difficult . 
  there will be an open primary to designate `` the republicans '' candidate , and contrary to all other times he will have to face serious competition , including from alain jupp\u00e9 , former pm , who 's much more popular . 
  it will be a very interesting race . 
  but then whoever wins that primary is virtually sure to become the next president , because the left is killed and le pen could n't possibly get a majority . 
  so if sarkozy manages to be the candidate and does n't fuck up * really * bad during the campaign , he wins his bet . 
  republicans in the netherlands would be far-left , no ? 
  if the greek government defaults on its debt , it will become extremely difficult for it to find lenders to finance its public deficit . 
  ( a solution would be to stop having any deficit after the default so as to not depend on lenders , but even though it seems greece could possibly manage that , it 'd be extremely risky because they 'd have no margin of policy anymore in a case of crisis ) so how to do it then ? 
  there are n't that many ways to get money for a government : * either you borrow it from the market ( which in that scenario is not possible ) * or you tax it from your economy ( that 's what the troika tried to do , but if greece defaults it 'd show it was not a sustainable solution ) * or you steal it from other countries ( by war , which is of course unacceptable , or by leeching from foreign aid , which the others will probably not accept - though they may let you temporarily , especially in the eu , which is why a default would n't necessarily mean grexit ) * or you print it from nothing at the cost of high inflation . 
  currently as greece is in the eurozone , only the ecb can print that money . 
  and , bad news for greece , the ecb is ( 1 ) independent from the countries ' governments and supposed not to let them dictate its policy , ( 2 ) its mandate is to fight inflation , so to * not * print a lot of money on no basis , ( 3 ) the treaties formally ban the ecb financing the countries ' debts , ( 4 ) the ecb 's policy is defined for the whole eurozone anyway , not just for greece 's interest . 
  greece is tiny in terms of the eu 's gdp . 
  so of course even if in the last years , the ecb tried to do what it could to fix the issue and change its policies despite breaking its mandate , it will never act as a printing machine for the greek government 's deficit . 
  so it would leave only one option to greece , that is to leave the euro so that a greek central bank can print worthless drachmas to pay back the debt and finance the deficit . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** if they default , noone will lend them money , so their only choice is to print it themselves , which they can only do by leaving the euro . 
  wait a minute , mps ca n't propose laws by themselves in germany ? 
  why do they need to ask for merkel 's permission ? 
  they could propose it themselves and see if a majority in parliament vote for it . 
  i 'd be willing to support one of those micronations if for once they did n't adopt such awful coats of arms . 
  no matter what is your position on the eu you know it currently does n't work well anymore , politically , geopolitically , in terms of security and even economically as we did n't solve any issue raised by the greek crisis . 
  what we need is to elect directly an assembly ( parallel to the eu parliament ) which would debate and decide what to do with the eu and try to write a new , simple treaty . 
  whether it is moving towards federalism or on the contrary scaling back to mere association ( or both ) , or even complete dissolution if that 's what people want . 
  then we would directly vote yes or no to the new treaty , and if it is accepted by a majority , the countries which refused would have to say whether they accept it anyway or prefer to leave the union . 
  or nous prenons en charge cette circulation . 
  what should have been the borders then ? 
  should countries have been balkanized to be hyper-homogenenous ? 
  or should they have been all lumped together into a huge , religiously diverse and unmanageable arab state which would quite predictably want to erase all its other national identities ? 
  or should europeans just have left the various groups and states of the region kill each other to draw the map in their favour , as the turks did to reclaim most of what should have been kurdistan ? 
  or maybe we should have left everyone under turkish rule , despite our promises ? 
   pro-green agenda this one at least is a complete joke , even more so than in other parties . 
  last election , her `` ecological '' platform was basically : 1 ) ecology should n't harm economic growth , industry , car use , etc. 
  in any way , and 2 ) immigration is bad for the environment ( wat ? 
  it 's not the same kind of two-rounds election as the one we have for the president . 
  the sykes-picot agreement does not correspond at all to current borders , and i do n't see how it is responsible in any way for today 's problems . 
  on the contrary , the agreement would have separated the shia and sunni regions of iraq . 
  the libyan intervention was necessary , legal and well conducted . 
  of course it created instability , but the alternative would have been either gaddafi slaughtering the rebels , or a long-lasting civil war like in syria , possibly leading ( just as in syria ) to the takeover of the rebellion by jihadists . 
  so yes , it worked out pretty well . 
  we did n't even send any troop to occupy the country , but just provided the necessary help to let the revolution end in the best possible way . 
  ** anarchism : ** anarchism has a pretty long history in france , especially because of proudhon , whose ideas were very influential on the commune of paris , far more than communists or even socialists . 
  the commune was indeed not at all communist , but it was very big on direct democracy , and most importantly on federalism , thinking that france should be organized as a federation of small , almost entirely autonomous communes . 
  at the time , the socialist movements were not marxist and had very different sorts of approach . 
  in the uk the labour was the party of the workers ' and tied to the unions , while in france the leftist parties were quite disconnected , and opposed by the main workers union , the cgt , which at the time was anarchosyndicalist and explicitely wanted to overthrow the government . 
  however with time they got softer and softer . 
  after that , anarchism was mostly important because of the terrorism wave that it created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . 
  anarchist terrorists killed the president , threw a bomb in the parliament , etc. 
  as a result , all anarchist publications and movements were criminalized until a few decades ago . 
  it then never really gained much support from the french , but many anarchist activists from spain or other countries kept the movement active . 
  a few artists like l\u00e9o ferr\u00e9 also popularized the idea in songs . 
  however it always remained completely fringe . 
  a bit less so in my hometown , it seems . 
  it has quite a lot of anarchists plastering posters or spraying graffiti everywhere , and a few years ago for no real reason they gathered in the city center to break shop windowswith baseball bats , write huge anarchist slogans everywhere and throw rocks at the police . 
  i think the biggest organization is the cnt , conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale du travail . 
  ** communism : ** in france the communist party used to be the biggest and most influential party after 1945 ( getting as much as one third of the votes ) . 
  they were very popular because of their involvement in the resistance and then their contribution to the adoption of post-war policies like social security . 
  the overwhelming majority of intellectuals , artists , and even just academia was communist , and even though they were not in power , they created a sort of parrallel communist culture for an entire part of the country . 
  so many people grew up reading pif gadget , a children comics magazine published by the communist party , or going to one of their many holiday camps , or to their big music festival . 
  progressively the communists lost weight compared to the socialists ( social-democrats ) , essentially because people started to question the ussr and how submitted the party was to it . 
  and they were * really * submitted , in fact even fanatical about stalin , so much that when he died you had communist newspapers going full personality cult with portraits by picasso , poems , etc. 
  and when krushchev decided the destalinization , the french communist party argued for a long time that it was all american fakes and krushchev never said anything like that about the great stalin . 
  most communist intellectuals were just a bit deluded about the ussr , or thinking that despite its atrocities it was still better than capitalism ( sartre ) , but others like the poet aragon ( whom i otherwise really like ) openly and publicly advocated for a totalitarian dictatorship and gulags in france .
