  napoleon 's french empire , just a big decade . 
  same for the third reich . 
  and so on . 
  so sure all empires fall after 250 years , if you can arbitrarily decide ( and change ) what an empire is and what it means to fall . 
  the author 's definition and explanation of what is and what causes a decadence only shows his ideological bias : against immigration , against the welfare state and for conservative and religious politics . 
  even though those things most of the time had absolutely nothing to do with the fall of any of those empires . 
  interestingly , the falling roman empire was incredibly more religious , less materialistic and less of a welfare state than it was in its golden age . 
  tl ; dr : all bs . 
  not really . 
  the thing is , migrants are ready to die to come live in europe , while europeans are ( fortunately ) not ready to kill anyone to prevent them from coming . 
  so that 's why it 's very complicated to stop them . 
  but if they were just isis fighters trying to conquer us , we would n't have any remorse . 
  it is not true that we are weak , we could kill anyone , just as we could wipe entire countries off the map . 
  we just do n't want to , because we 're not viktor orban . 
  / u/zerojanvier 's office says `` insulting / u/zerojanvier not within freedom of expression '' . 
  so you better keep quiet . 
  exactly . 
  what 's the most ridiculous is the party leader saying '' he would be the most representative mayor the people of oslo have ever known '' . 
  so much representative that he only represents 5 seats on 59 ... 
  anyway it would be really surprising that he does become mayor . 
  oslo is i assume an important city to control in norwegian politics , so i doubt the left wing leaders will just say `` oh we got far more votes than you and we 've been trying to become mayor for years , but it 's okay , here , take the post '' . 
  france is a really bad example and you know it , because we have a completely different voting system . 
  the greens ' 2 % in * majoritary votes * is not representative of their actual political weight ( 9 % at the last proportionnal election , that 's not negligible for the socialists ) . 
  besides , the practice of granting safe seats and ministries to small parties is the practice in france specifically because otherwise they would not get * any * representation and grow very dissatisfied . 
  finally the socialists completely ignored and violated their policy agreements with the greens , so i do n't really see how they `` forced hollande to change his program '' . 
  the current goverment cares even less about the environment than sarkozy 's . 
  so it 's been 9 months and foreign newspapers still do n't know how to read charlie hebdo 's dark humour and irony ? 
  just because they make a joke about a tragic event does n't mean they make it * against the victim * , ffs . 
  i always wonder if those who are offended by it honestly think ch is racist or if they are just salty about the muhammad cartoons . 
   commission itself is a one big old boys club they 're all appointed from different governments of different countries and different parties , when they get nominated i suppose most of them do n't even know each other . 
  so if that 's what a one big old boys club is , i do n't want to know what our national governments are , where the pm generally appoints some of his close friends from the same school and same party . 
  did he get $ 40 not to give a $ 35 ticket ? 
  denmark uses ius sanguinis and only allows naturalization after more than 8 years of residence . 
  so it wo n't be a problem . 
  in france and some other countries , a bit more ( we have a limited ius solis and only 5 years of residence to get naturalized ) . 
  [ here is a french poem also from 500 years ago . 
  ] ( https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/ballade_des_pendus ) apart from weird spelling ( it was n't fixed yet ) and some expressions that are not used anymore , it seems like the language did n't really change . 
  the rhymes are the same as now . 
  however it still does n't tell us about accents - we know that people from most regions of france until recently had a pretty strong accent , but we do n't really know whether the central , parisian french was already as monotonous as nowadays . 
  some people claim that old french was more like canadian french ; well yes and no , because the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois come mostly from the western regions like poitou , which indeed had a pretty similar dialect . 
  but it does n't tell us much about the standard , parisian french of the time . 
  i have read also that a bit like in op 's english example , the french used to pronounce all the letters including those that are now silent . 
  i doubt about it though , because as i said a single word could have many different spellings , but was normally only pronounced one way . 
  still it seems that some letters now silent were pronounced back then . 
  for instance nowadays the letters `` an '' , `` on '' , `` un '' , etc. 
  are their own nasal voyel sound ; back then we pronounced both the nasal voyel sound and the n. also `` oi '' , now pronounced * wa * , was pronounced like * way * . 
  there were probably many more differences , but it 's quite difficult to know . 
  [ here is the original picture though . 
   clergy member : 1.6 % now i really want to try out that 1.6 % chance , start my own robot-church and kill competition thanks to my super priestbots able to do ten prayers per second . 
  obviously joking , btw : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kvrdf/french_people_and_linguistic_pride_arrogance/, 
  the eu and its predecessors were definitely a federalist project from the very start ; to see that you just need to read [ the schuman declaration ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm ) , that we still celebrate every year on may 9 : it explicitely calls the ecsc `` the first concrete foundation of a european federation '' and `` a first step in the federation of europe '' . 
  it 's just that european federalists remembered about the pacifist initiatives of the interwar period , and especially aristide briand 's project of a federal european union ( surprisingly approved by 27 countries ... before getting completely forgotten a few weeks later when streseman died and the great depression started ) . 
  they all failed because they simply tried to * decrete * peace and unity without actually * building * and guaranteeing it in any concrete way . 
  that 's why instead they decided to focus on how to make war materially impossible and force governments to keep working with each other . 
  the coal and steel community was not at all made to be a mere free trade area for those commodities , it was made as a union where states lost all their power over these sectors , so that it would be impossible for them to requisition them to build armaments , while all economic intervention ( much needed after the war ) had to go through a common high authority ( ancestor of the commission ) . 
  later the eec clearly attempted to be the basis for a future federal state , by creating its own parliament , government , laws and judiciary . 
  by the way , if it was n't for french communists and gaullists who vetoed the [ 1952 treaty of paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_community ) , we would have had a unified european military for more than 60 years already . 
  the center-right is n't `` divided '' , it simply has several candidates for investiture , who will compete next year in an open primary , just as the socialists did in 2011 . 
  they too were `` divided '' between several serious contenders , but then they all rallied behind hollande and he won the election . 
  the same will almost certainly happen for the right-wing this time . 
  marine le pen can be delighted all she wants , it wo n't change that at least 60 % of voters are resolute * never * to vote for her in any circumstance . 
  she will likely get to the second round , but she ca n't win . 
  maybe . 
  though most of them are n't really `` foreign '' anymore . 
  i do n't know if it 's voluntary or if it 's just that politicians lack initiative and prefer pushing the problems under the rug rather than having to deal with them . 
   i mean , the fact that the descendants of immigrants do n't segregate themselves as much in london than in paris is not really something to ` celebrate ' . 
  why not ? 
  noone said it was perfect , she just compared london and paris in that regard , trying to see what exactly was so much better for immigrants there than in france . 
  also she says she lives in one of those `` diverse '' areas , so not a 99 % white british neighbourhood . 
  the eu is ** not ** purely about the economy . 
  it is a ** political ** union , and it does have a military component . 
  every member state has the obligation to help and defend any other if it is attacked , so if estonia gor invaded by russia , sweden would have to take part in that war , nato or not . 
  joint forces and military cooperation are still very limited , but hopefully that will improve in the future . 
  she 's right on this point though . 
  it has been 10 years since the suburbs ' riots , and we even had major government plans about paris ' metropolis , but we have n't done * anything * for those areas , in fact these metropolis plans were all focused on the rich western suburbs . 
  a few months ago the prime minister talked about segregation , and what has he done about it since ? 
  nothing . 
   so basically what she is saying is that she enjoys london more than paris because it 's less white . 
  no , first of all i doubt paris is any whiter than london , and if you had read the article you 'd see she just compares the fate of the poorer , ethnically diverse neighbourhoods in each city . 
  what she says is that paris is far more segregated and its suburbs are incredibly more disaffected than their british equivalents like tottenham . 
  london is more `` diverse '' than paris in that there is not such a big division between the richest , whitest parts and the others . 
   there are dozens of middle ground solutions that would n't negatively affect anybody and would settle the issue for good . 
  like what ? 
  an arbitration court , maybe , but i doubt argentina would agree to that except if the judges were definitel biased against the uk . 
  other than that , i do n't see what would be a `` middle ground '' . 
  protecting them does n't necessarily mean protecting the land - they could just as well be taken to safety in the uk . 
  in the end it 's more a question of principle : the falklands belong to britain from history and by international law , it is a sovereign part of your country , the argentinian claims are bogus and the people living there want to stay british , so giving it away to argentina just because they occasionally throw a tantrum about it and threaten to use violence , that would be cowardice and submitting to bullying . 
  well for historical and cultural reasons the french have always been reluctant to speak other languages and especially english ( in fact for decades the state even tried to * deter * students from learning english as a second language , promoting german instead and guaranteeing that those who choose german would get the best teachers ) . 
  now we finally try to make progress , but i think the biggest problem is that our education system is based on the model of the teacher making his class and the students keeping quiet and copying it . 
  of course this is not how you 're supposed to learn a language , and that 's why language teachers try to push their students to participate more in class . 
  but they 're not used to it and so it 's quite difficult . 
  i can say that every single european exchange student that i knew in highschool remarked on that , amazed about how little french students participate in class . 
  there 's also the question of dubs vs. subs that might play a role . 
  here basically everything foreign on tv is systematically dubbed , while in the countries who mentioned it 's generally not the case , which helps people learn english without even noticing it . 
  so in the end you have many people who studyenglish at school , but they did n't even really practice it at the time , and even less after . 
  still the younger generations are fortunately more proficient , so there 's some progress . 
  haha , the germans sure are hopeful it seems , but no , we 're definitely not phasing out nuclear power anytime soon . 
  increased renewable 's production is normal and has been decided long ago already in line with all our environmental commitments . 
  but our strategy is still absolutely based on nuclear energy , and i 'd say the difficulties with the epr will only make france even more interested in nuclear power , because with all the money wasted on it already , we will want to rip some benefits from it , by ensuring we are the leaders on that technology and master it so we can build eprs all around the world . 
  reading your comment i thought it would have looked like a neat bell tower .
