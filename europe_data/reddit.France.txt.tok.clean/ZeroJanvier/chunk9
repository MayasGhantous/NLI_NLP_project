  so if he got money , that was n't actually for his campaign but for himself , however that 's not what the ex-gaddafi minister claimed . 
  what is clear is that sarkozy and gaddafi had a sort of deal before , or shortly after his election , which is why he was very lavishly invited to paris and why sarkozy tried to reinsert libya in the international community , after having been considered a rogue , terrorist state for decades . 
  now it does n't mean he personally got money in exchange . 
  the deal may just have included geopolitical influence ( remember his mediterranean union project ? 
  ) , contracts for french companies , arms sales , cooperation against immigration , etc. 
  as we know eventually gaddafi humiliated him by crashing those hopes . 
  since there is an investigation we can hope to learn more about all that but i doubt we will . 
  this is very likely ( since apparently `` everyone '' knew the stories about dsk ) but at the same time this failed conspiracy shows perfectly how the sofitel events were on the contrary not a conspiracy at all : sarkozy had no interest in destroying dsk * before * the campaign . 
  i know . 
  very few people out of israel and the us actually support zionism . 
  i put quotation marks because the `` anti-zionists '' i 'm talking about and who share those conspiracy theories are just using that label as a euphemism/shield so as not to call themselves antisemites , and use `` zionist '' as a code-word for `` jew '' . 
  what i meant by `` breaking apart our secularism laws '' is that those laws tell us to disregard religious beliefs , not to accomodate them , and it seems the court will break that by ruling there is a legal requirement to serve a halal/kosher option . 
   i guess it comes down to whether french courts take intent into account when looking to see whether a law is constitutional . 
  if not , this does open the door to all sorts of laws that are technically secular but deeply involved with religious matters in practice . 
  very good point . 
  i have no idea about that , though . 
  if so the precedent would be that lawmakers ca n't act with the intent to discriminate , rather than about a right to accomodation . 
  that could be great actually , and prevent similar cases . 
  you 're right , it all depends on the definition of public order , which could theoretically be stretched further and further , but iirc the courts have a precise definition for it now . 
  not a vegetarian option ( vegetarianism is unfortunately quite uncommon here ) , but there are generally two meals and you can ask not to take any meat . 
  the thing to understand in this case is that the mayor is not trying to find a reasonable compromise that would make everyone happy . 
  the previous system worked perfectly already . 
  on the contrary , he deliberately tries to fuck with muslims by forcing them by all means to eat pork or starve . 
  it 's really wicked , but legally there is no right to get the meal you want . 
   if it 's wrong for muslims to try to force halal diets on everyone else , is n't it also wrong to go out of your way to try to get muslims to eat pork or go hungry ? 
  it is obviously very wrong . 
  there was no legitimate reason to change the policy , which worked perfectly for everyone . 
  the mayor is just a populist surfing on anti-muslim hatred . 
  but unfortunately towns are pretty much free to decide their school lunches , and we do not recognize the rights of people to have their religious beliefs accomodated , so as far as i know , legally there should be no case there . 
  instead of going to court and risking to break apart our secularism laws , they should have asked for a national law guaranteeing the choice between two meals using different products , as it is practiced in most schools already . 
  almost all school cafeterias propose two alternative meals ( not just when there is pork , but all the time , to give more choice ) , and allow students to ask not to get meat . 
  this works perfectly and there is no problem . 
  this mayor deliberately chose to annoy muslims ( and harm everyone else at the same time , plus risk that courts create a dangerous precedent against our secularism laws ) by removing the alternative meal . 
  he clearly does n't want to solve the problem reasonably , he just wants to create controversy and signal he does n't like muslims . 
  that 's really shitty but the question is a legal one , and in principle the town is pretty free to choose its school lunches and no exception or accomodation should be offered based on religious beliefs . 
  exactly . 
  it 's a difficult case because on the one hand this mayor is acting like a giant jerk just to annoy muslims for no real reason , but on the other hand ( and no matter what the stupid people in the article claim ) our secularism laws precisely tell us to * disregard * religion , and * not * to make `` reasonable accomodations '' to people 's beliefs like anglos do . 
  we do n't care if a teacher believes she has to wear the veil , or if a policeman believes he has to wear a kippa or a turban , they can not because that 's the law and their personal beliefs are irrelevant . 
  so if the school only serves pork , children will have to deal with it , no matter how cruel it seems . 
  but what 's frustrating is that it is a completely artificial issue , since there is no reason why there should n't be an alternative meal in the first place . 
  it is the common practice , does n't cost much and benefits all students . 
  i like that . 
  `` the law shall not restrict freedom of speech expect in cases determined by law . '', 
  that 's awesome !, 
  if you can , you should think about updating the presentation though . 
  with something like a map to click or hand over countries to show their newsfeed , rather having all of them next to each other . 
  you could also highlight some articles you think are important , to show the top european headlines of the day . 
  that website can have a lot of potential .

  it 's a vicious cycle : the eu political and mediatic space can only grow in importance if the eu gets more political powers ( because then the stakes would be higher and the top politicians would run for office ) , but people will not accept to give more powers to the eu until it becomes more `` democratic '' , i.e. 
  until the eu political and mediatic space grows in importance . 
  i think you mean contempt . 
  i thought liveleak hosted videos , not anonymous baseless accusations by people with an axe to grind and barely speaking english . 
  the thing is that whether lightspeed is the fastest possible speed or not is not a question of human progress and intelligence , it is independent from us . 
  we can have the best hopes and confidence in humanity 's capacity to innovate and invent new technology , but we ca n't just assume that somehow we 'll find that the physical laws that annoy us will prove to be wrong . 
  actually , i do n't think it 's a problem . 
  we ca n't claim moon territory as a sovereign part of our countries , but we are not banned from building bases which we can freely administrate . 
  it 's exactly as in antarctica , if you ignore the countries ' claims . 
  america has no claim on antarctica but builds inhabited bases which are under its control . 
  any foreign attack on those base would be an attack on the state which controls it , not because it has sovereignty but because it would be an attack on its citizens/military . 
  exactly . 
  it 's very puerile to pretend that things you do n't like simply do n't exist . 
  a government can perfectly decide not to have diplomatic relations with another , or not to recognize the * legitimacy * of a state / of a border , but it can not just deny * reality * . 
  8 % sounds surprisingly low actually , compared to the number of people believing in conspiracy theories in the us or here , and given the resentment against russia . 
  there 's the unfortunately huge crowd of `` antizionist '' activists who systematically blame any act of islamic terrorism ( especially when it targets jews ) on ... jews . 
  * 9/11 was an americano - `` zionist '' false flag * mohamed merah 's attacks were a franco - `` zionist '' false flag * this january 's attacks were a franco - `` zionist '' false flag * daesh is an americano - `` zionist '' creation other popular conspiracy theories : * sarkozy plotted the rape accusations against domique strauss-khan , then head of the imf and likely socialist candidate . 
  ( less popular now that it 's pretty clear dsk is indeed a pervert . ), 
  * sarkozy waged war in libya then sent an assassin to kill gaddafi because he wanted to reveal how he illegally financed his 2007 campaign ( not exactly a conspiracy theory since there is an actual investigation on this ) . 
  * there 's a great pedophile network of top level politicians and personalities ( not that unlikely given what was uncovered in the uk ) * in the far-right : political elites actively try to turn the country into a non-white muslim country * supporters of sarkozy think hollande is behind all of his judicial cases . 
  * supporters of the fringe party upr think the fn is controlled opposition . 
  ** edit : ** / u/antigoneinthewall is right , there is a big conspiracy theory saying the comedian coluche was killed by the state . 
  there 's also very big suspicions about the `` suicide '' of labour minister robert boulin in 1979 , possibly commandited by jacques chirac or by his now deceased but very shady ally charles pasqua . 
  i 'm not sure iceland is part of it , since it is not in the eu ( but is in the efta ) . 
  the ratification is probably not for soon , but if syriza is still in power in greece they 're likely to reject it . 
  also it depends on the content of the treaty . 
  if it contains isds by private arbitration courts , despite numerous rejection by european and national officials , i 'd say it is almost certain one country at least will end up voting no under popular pressure . 
  about my hometown ** poitiers ** , first there is the ancient legend of the ** grand ` goule ** , a dragon which lived in the town 's undergrounds in the early middle ages and occasionally ate the nuns who came there alone . 
  the local saint , radegonde ( who was the queen of france but left her husband and crown to retreat in poitiers in a monastery ) came down unarmed to the underground , and threw holy water on the beast , which either died , or became a good and protective force for the city . 
  during processions , a big wooden statue of the dragon was walked around the city , and children threw little biscuits at it . 
  now it is the name of a night club . 
  then there is the ancient society of ** the order of the venerable bitard ( praised it be ) ** or ** bitards ** ( * bite * means * dick * ) , as far as i know the only equivalent of american `` secret societies '' or `` fraternities '' there is in france . 
  they dress with capes and hats from the renaissance , celebrate each year the `` 69th student week '' , take part regularly in barathons across the city , have the duty to drink on the other students ' behalf , and venerate an imaginary animal called the bitard ( * bitardus paradoxus * ) , [ with a weasel head , fish body , cat legs and peacock tail ] ( http://images.delcampe.com/img_large/auction/000/194/993/058_001.jpg ) . 
  they also pranked gullible students by proposing them to hunt that beast in the forest , then abbandoning them there . 
  the order was officially created in 1922 , though the tradition is certainly quite older , and is an hommage to rabelais , a famous renaissance writer , humourist and great hedonist . 
  it is a real local institution which gets received by the mayor , the police , the prefect , etc. 
  finally , an interesting story . 
  the story of ** blanche monnier , the sequestrated of poitiers ** . 
  in 1901 the authorities received an anonymous letter warning them that something strange was going on in some apparently normal family . 
  they discovered that in one of the rooms there was a 50 year-old woman living there in the dark , completely naked , in her own filth and wastes , with all sorts of vermins , and starving to death ( she weighted only 25kg - 55lbs ) . 
  [ here is a pic of her in a hospital ] ( http://miralienor.free.fr/images/sequestree01.jpg ) ( nsfw i guess ) . 
  it turns out her mother had locked her up in her room 25 years before , to prevent her from leaving and marrying her fianc\u00e9 , whom the family disapproved of . 
  the mother died just before her trial , and blanche 's brother , who also lived there , was eventually acquitted because at the time there was no duty to assist and protect , and since the 25 years of sequestration had turned blanche completely insane and led her to refuse food/clothes/hygiene / etc. , it was not possible to prove that the state in which she had been found was forced on her by her brother . 
  that story was a big national scandal , also political , because that family was royalist and sequestrated their daughter because her fianc\u00e9 was a protestant republican . 
  blanche monnier remained completely insane and broken and died in an asylum in 1913 . 
  comparative advantage theory is precisely what makes china richer and richer . 
  instead of closing their borders and producing everything themselves , they focused on low-qualification work and exported plenty of things that they do n't need , so as to get enough money to import all the other goods they wanted , and have enough funds to invest in education , infrastructure , etc. 
  and develop the country . 
  as education levels rise , the comparative advantage shifts towards more complex goods like high tech . 
  it means china can focus on those sectors and import the low-quality goods from other countries ( well that 's how it worked for japan , taiwan , korea , etc. 
  ; china though is so big that they can still `` import '' those goods from their inner , less developed countryside ) .
