i do n't know after ten years you should know the basics of the language without trying if you hear it everyday . 
  that 's insane . 
   chirac was known to be classy yep . 
  once , a random guy shouted at him `` connard ! '', 
  ( * asshole ! * ) . 
  he replied `` nice to meet you , i 'm jacques chirac '' . 
  i did n't know they had their own alphabet . 
  [ here is how it looks like . 
  ] ( http://bazieri.narod.ru/writing_georgian.gif ), 
  yeah that 's right , i should have say `` was '' . 
  brittany has always been considered very religious, 
   the cost of living in paris is 22 % cheaper than in oslo . 
  well damn . 
  is it simply because the cost of living in norway is way higher than in france ? 
  cause oslo is nowhere near as touristic as paris . 
  no way . 
  we 'll build a wall to prevent that from happening . 
  i was waiting for a german to explain in great details why this is n't funny, 
  it 's a whole d\u00e9partement but i get your point , the suburban areas of every major cities tend to be quite uninteresting . 
  seine-saint denis ? 
  i mean unless you 're really into mordern architecture or hip-hop i do n't see why you 'd go there as a tourist . 
  since a lot of people here seem interested in that topic i think i 'll make album with maps for different types of alcohols and other stuff ( legal drinking age , prevalence of alcoholism , etc ) . 
  author here !, 
  i took the numbers from brewers of europe and they simply did n't have any data for theses countries . 
  iirc it 's because they are in another layer ( slightly transparent ) over the layer used for countries . 
  basically this the way the blank map from wikipedia was drawn and i did n't bother to change it . 
  author here !, 
  if eastern europeans are disappointed here is the map for spirits consumption : http://i.imgur.com/o0weqte.jpg, 
  oh that 's my map :d funny to see it posted here again a year later . 
  [ i also made one with spirit consumption ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o0weqte.jpg ) go eastern europe !, 
  you 're mostly drunk, 
  ah thanks for the explanation , 
  no but i 'd love too . 
  also prague . 
  what kind of food do they have in austria ? 
  except for viennoiseries maybe i do n't know anything about it . 
  just cross the channel if you want quality food :p, 
  yeah that 's the place . 
  i just ca n't remember hungarian names , it 's too weird :p, 
  [ here is a shitty guide with what i can remember from when i visited . 
  they compensate for their lack of mountains, 
  i 'm a mod of / r/france ( 15 000 + subscribers ) and / r/contagiouslaughter ( 60 000 + ) . 
  / r/europe is definitely one of my favourite subs . 
  * ** do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  ( not required ) ** i can use automoderator . 
  i know a bit of css ( i 'm not going to redesign a whole subreddit but i can make modifications if needed ) . 
  we use the mod toolbox on / r/france . 
  * ** what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  ** i live in france so gmt +1 . 
  * ** what is your favorite/least favorite thing about r/europe and what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  ** i really enjoy being able to share things and talk with people from all over europe , get to know different cultures ... ( and the maps also :p ) . 
  however the racism/hate speech we sometimes find here is obviously deplorable . 
  that 's why i believe a strict moderation is always necessary . 
  * ** what would make you a good moderator ? 
  ** i 've got a pretty good experience as a moderator on reddit , especially on / r/france which deals with the same kind of content as / r/europe , so i guess i know how things works . 
  i think i 'm fair , reasonable and fun ( or at least i hope :p ) . 
  i think that 's pretty much it . 
  if you have any questions , ask away , 
  yes !, 
  shit 's freaking delicious, 
  charles x abdicated in 1830 , then louis-phillipe in 1848 . 
  that being said they may have been sliced in half too if they had n't . 
  in the south of belgium too , you can find bisons in bastogne . 
  also i do n't think the people in rural turkey care for twitter as much as the students in istanbul do . 
  you know french holocaust survivors use the sncf everyday . 
  i 've never heard anybody complain about it . 
  this is just a ridiculous justification . 
  totally . 
  railway workers were very active in the resistance too . 
  you can often find the name of these men on monuments in railway stations around france . 
  yeah , that was indeed just a joke . 
  that being said the `` collaboration '' excuse is pretty distasteful . 
   blame the french company because they collaborated with the nazis  choose a german company, 
  this thread makes me happy, 
  actually i just knew it was a famous spanish painting but i had no idea what it was about . 
  so apparently it represents the execution of spanish rebels by french soldiers . 
  uhu , sorry i guess ... :p, 
  i 'll aslo add [ tres de mayo , by goya ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/el_tres_de_mayo%2c_by_francisco_de_goya%2c_from_prado_in_google_earth.jpg/996px-el_tres_de_mayo%2c_by_francisco_de_goya%2c_from_prado_in_google_earth.jpg ), 
  also :  i took a dump at the nordic tri-border point and mounted my trusty moose gosafj\u00e4ll\u00f6rn to ride off into the sunset - my glorious bare buttocks were visible and shone in the darkness like two ripe peaches !, 
  it looks cubist, 
  [ the citro\u00ebn 2cv ] ( http://ldayot.ouvaton.org/img/jpg/av_coul_.jpg ) without a doubt !, 
  unfortunately it 's getting rarer and rarer . 
  you could do european regions . 
  bavaria , brittany , catalonia , lombardy , crete , yorkshire , jutland , etc, 
  in fact it wo n't be very different . 
  first waves was 1917 with the fall of the russian empire . 
  then 1918 with the end of the prussian and austrian empire . 
  then for the rest of eastern europe , it 's just after of during ww2 . 
  sorry , my english is terrible . 
  * most of the monarchies in europe are constitutional monarchies , which means that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state : either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so , or the monarch does not utilise the political powers vested in the office by convention . 
  the exceptions are liechtenstein , which is usually considered a semi-constitutional monarchy due to the large influence the prince still has on politics , and the vatican city , which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy . 
  * from wikipedia .

  i always thought it was the americans . 
  thank you for correcting me :d, 
  \u2022 iceland used to belong to denmark . 
  then it was invaded by the us and given independence later in 1944 iirc . 
  \u2022 bj\u00f6rk \u2022 the mayor of the capital city , reykjavik , is a jedi . 
  \u2022 they had a rough time during the financial crisis in 2008 .
