if you do n't feel like reading my long post : tl ; dr : as the title says , i 'm interested in what you think about the pope 's visit to strasbourg . 
  are you in favour or against it ? 
  are there politicians in your country who oppose it ? 
  what 's the general feeling in your country ? 
  the rest of my post is a short summary of how this question is being treated in france , and i 'll try to translate two politicians ' texts who explain why they disagree with the pope 's visit . 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- as you know , we 're very very attached to our secularism here . 
  so when the pope comes to address the european parliament , there are people who come forward to say they 're against it . 
  but ... not that many actually . 
  the medias are mostly commenting on jean-luc melenchon 's letter to the pope , and they are ridiculing him . 
  so we have : jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , who is from the front de gauche ( far-left ) , alexis corbi\u00e8re from the `` parti de gauche '' ( far-left , same group ) and virginie rozi\u00e8re from the parti radical de gauche ( center left ) . 
  there may be a few others , but i 'm commenting on what i 've heard : mainly criticism against jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon . 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- here are my attempts at translating jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon 's letter and virginie rozi\u00e8re 's statement ( i tried finding translations on google but i could n't find anything ) : ^ if ^ some ^ french ^ people ^ with ^ a ^ better ^ level ^ of ^ english ^ want ^ to ^ correct ^ me , ^ please ^ do . 
  * mr pope , * * welcome to france . 
  many of your flocks are here , and many of them are also my supporters . 
  maybe you 've heard that some people are against your address at the european parliament . 
  i 'm one of them . 
  i would like to explain to you why . 
  * then he explains this is n't a personal attack , nor an attack against the catholic religion . 
  he writes about his love for argentina , and about his former * `` commitment for the liberation of argentines persecuted by military rebels who had submitted argentina to their abominable dictatorship '' * . 
  ( camp `` el vesuvio '' ) : * `` among the thirty thousand missing , more than twenty french committed alongside the argentines in the resistance to the dictatorship . 
  and among them , two nuns with an immense courage : alice domon and leonie duquet , tortured and thrown into the sea , and the priest gabriel de longueville , kidnapped and riddled with bullets . 
  i do not forget . 
  '' * he then writes about the views he shares with the pope : * `` i heard your harsh criticism against the domination of society by money . 
  your address to the powerful of the earth and your loving words to the poor struggling for their dignity caught my scrupulous attention . 
  i heard it as an echo of the liberation theology , which has been and remains a key source of inspiration for all my friends who are christian believers and are involved in the management of the destinies of their homelands in south america . 
  the preferential option for the poor is a fruitful path for the conduct of civil cases . 
  anyone friend of republican virtues can make it their own . 
  for my part , risking myself to give my opinion frankly in an area where you stay of course the only judge legitimate , i would receive it as a major signal if the thinkers of this movement were no longer forbidden by the church to speak . 
  [ ... ] '' * he writes about the pope 's views that he does n't share : * `` i could not speak to you without telling you how many we are to be hurt by some of your negative options . 
  i 'm thinking about what you are doing against the right to abortion , the use of contraception , and in another domain , the right to choose to '' turn off the light '' of one 's life , helped by a hand that relieves the act . 
  or what you are doing against the civil marriage of people of the same sex . 
  i understand that christian believers are hostile to it and refuse it . 
  if necessary , i would do everything for them not to be imposed on the opposite choice they have . 
  but why try to impose their choice on all the others ? 
  why prevent favorable legislation that opens the choice on the subject ? 
  why militate against those already established ? 
  why act to harden the repressive legal requirements when these rights are already severely repressed and punished ? 
  why impose on us who do not impose anything on others on this subject , the obligation to submit to a dictate which is contrary to our concept of human dignity ? 
  the disastrous results of this determination to impose the dogma on others are already huge , as evidenced by the agony of thousands of women and the persecution against people whose sexual orientation does not suit you . 
  the idea of placing the law on the need to conform to the dogma is a perilous path for our societies and full of violence for people . 
  '' * he writes about the position of france regarding secularism / `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' : * '' mr. pope , my country has suffered from three centuries of religious wars . 
  the struggle of protestants , jews and humanists for religious freedom has lead painfully to the law on the separation of the churches and state . 
  it guarantees to everyone the absolute freedom to practice or not practice religion . 
  it absolutely forbids that religion and politics are intertwined in the life of institutions , which must remain open to all . 
  in a democracy , the only legitimate law is the law determined freely by the people through their votes . 
  we know the constant hostility of the church and the popes on this point . 
  however , in this time , more than in any other recent period , this rule has been important to ensure peace and civil concord . 
  we will strive to convince you , because i saw that the church can also hear the way of human reason . 
  so , even though your predecessors have condemned universal suffrage until 1906 and the republic until 1920 , i do not think that you would recommend to go back to these points of views expressed in fierce encyclicals . 
  i even think that you would be with us if we were to confront people who would try to deprive us of these two benefits , because you have seen in your own country what crimes are made possible by the indifference with these requirements . 
  '' * main arguments : ** --  ** * `` mr. pope , your place at the gallery/platform of the parliament can not be accepted as part of a formal session of our assembly . 
  this impossibility is not against your person or your faith nor against your many faithfuls [ ... ] . 
  the impossibility results of our republican definition of an assembly of deputies of the sovereign people . 
  you have the wisdom and culture that probably allowed you to predict that many of us would be humiliated by such violation of the rules of secularism essential for a european parliament , which includes , in particular , french people whose law prohibits such confusion . 
  none of us can express our opinion on your presence within the free debate of parliament . 
  we are experiencing a situation that is imposed on us by some conceited people who expect personal glory at the expense of essential principles . 
  europeans will not be '' united in diversity '' if the basic rule of secularism that makes possible this unit is despised . 
  '' * conclusion : * `` this having been said frankly , i renew my vows to welcome you in a french city . 
  i would have preferred that you had come to celebrate a mass in the beautiful cathedral of strasbourg , which is part of your duty , rather than to give a ( political ) speech at our forum , which contradicts our duty . 
  '' * * jean luc m\u00e9lenchon , member of the french people to the european parliament . 
  * - there is another text , to accompany his letter : ** -  ** * `` i do not agree , as you just read . 
  i believe that the parliament is not the place of a sermon whatsoever . 
  i am a defender of absolute separation of the churches and the state . 
  since the announcement of this visit in september , i expressed my strong disapproval . 
  shortly after the publication of my press release on the subject , we learned from the speaker of parliament , martin schulz , that the pope was invited '' as head of state . '', 
  this status is often used by popes to allow the catholic church to be represented as such in the discussions of international institutions : the vatican is presented as a state . 
  the vatican is a district of rome , nothing more , assigned to the pope as an ultimate survival of the middle ages and as the stubborn opposition of the papacy to italian unity . 
  since his first reply , the president of the european parliament has changed his tune : he invited the pope as '' are invited other religious figures like the dalai lama or the mufti of damascus . '', 
  for the german socialist , that would be a kind of excuse . 
  as if the problem was the religion concerned . 
  as if the problem was an indescribable duty of equal treatment of religious leaders . 
  coming from a country where the separation of church and state has never occurred , martin schulz does not even understand what we are talking about . 
  needless to say he is not alone in this chamber . 
  but suppose for a moment that we accept this argument . 
  are we dealing with a simple preacher whose moral authority is recognized by billions of believers who apply the precepts and injunctions he formulates ? 
  not only !, 
  '' * ** --  ** * `` the popes are the leaders of a global bias that acts in a coordinated militant way to enter in the civil law revealed truths which it presents itself as the depositary !, 
  this bias led the catholic churches to fervently argue against the right to abortion , the use of contraception and even the use of condoms . 
  and even against gay marriage . 
  it is their right , even though we know what horrible human disasters such requirements conduit . 
  when humanistic and egalitarian laws on this subject are adopted , the church fights for their withdrawal . 
  when such laws do not exist , the church militates in favour of more repression and prohibitions . 
  it was clearly seen in countries where abortion is already banned and where the church campaigned for that obligation to be extended to cases where the life of the mother is in danger !, 
  in argentina itself , the present pope 's homeland , the church campaigned in one case , exceptional in its impact , to force a minor to complete a pregnancy resulting from rape . 
  and this pope does not take a back seat on the subject ; the last time he received members of the european parliament in the vatican was in 2013 , to organize the rejection by the right and the extreme right of a report on women 's rights . 
  the negative response of the pope on this issue was crucial because the report was rejected by 7 votes . 
  recently , in front of a gathering of catholic doctors , he encouraged them to deny access to the rights that the law recognizes for abortion rights . 
  `` it is not lawful to dismiss a human life to solve a problem , '' he said . 
  he then invited the catholic doctors to make `` courageous and ` against the current ' choices '' under '' conscientious objection '' . 
  denying the law in the name of religion , ie that the injunctions of that religion apply to the whole society . 
  '' * * `` it is this religious leader , bearer of this message , and this action in the world , who is received in the european parliament to intervene before meps . 
  for me , this is not the pope himself or his function , much less what he can represent for the faithfuls of the catholic church who are involved . 
  i protest against the political and institutional role assigned to him on this occasion . 
  '' * [ ... ] ** --  ** * `` this new reception of the pope therefore takes place in conditions which are a form of recognition of the church as a sovereign power in the european public space . 
  indeed , the pope will also meet the current president of the eu , the italian prime minister matteo renzi , the president of the european commission jean claude juncker and european council president herman van rompuy . 
  all european institutions are mobilized for his visit . 
  europe is not doing so for many heads of state . 
  in the parliament , under the leadership of president schulz , the pope 's visit is presented as a major institutional point of the mandate . 
  schulz went to the vatican twice to personally prepare the visit , in 2013 and in october 2014 . 
  the apostolic nuncio is the guest of the european parliamentary channel this week .
