  it 's not culture , it 's entertainment . 
  maybe * you * can , but i doubt that those who the authors of the films you watch would agree with you . 
  unless you 're watching chuck norris , texas ranger all day . 
  culture is a little bit like fundamental research . 
  a big , long , and not obviously cost-effective investment . 
  but you ca n't do without , really . 
  if you 're talking about the tva , a tax on each sold good , the drawback is that it hits everyone , include the poorest people . 
  if you increase this tax , milk , shoes , toilet paper , everything becomes slighty more expensive . 
  the advantage of taxing specific product categories is that it hits only those who actually buy them . 
  now , the dvd tax is absolutely ridiculous : one pays a tax for storing your holiday photos , because you may actually be a pirate . 
  except that , as someone points out elsewhere , real pirates know how to buy dvds outside the country . 
  we love kafka too much i guess . 
  indeed , come here and taste our [ bleu d'auvergne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bleu_d%27auvergne ) . 
  if it 's not coming from france , it 's not cheese . 
  i 've always found the word `` d\u00e9j\u00e0 '' ( as in `` d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu '' ) wonderful for its accents that look like the eyebrows of a slightly disappointed person , which sometimes fit the meaning ( `` it 's xmas soon , _ d\u00e9j\u00e0 _ ! '' ), 
  but you are right , even i sometimes have to correct two or three times a word because the spell-checker keeps underlining it ( especially the word `` ex\u00e9cuter '' ; i ca n't remember were on which `` e '' is the accent ) . 
  you have so much oil , why do n't you import artists ? 
   i am not cynical enough to believe that the us is out to get the eu . 
  it 's far better and more sensible in the modern connected world to work together rather than fighting against one another . 
  i am not so sure about that if we talk about economic wars . 
  think boeing vs airbus . 
   there is a phrase amongst some of us here in the uk , how the french government basically brown-noses the germans  i could be snarky here and answer , `` see , you are instigating dissension ... 
  again ! '', 
  ;-)  in all seriousness though , even if they were using us ( of which you have n't exactly proven that to me ) , how does that matter ? 
  are you asking a frenchman to teach you honour ? 
  in all seriousness though , to use and to be used is an asymmetric relationship that potentially includes unpleasant properties like being expendable . 
  at least within europe you have voting rights . 
   so want to kick out sweden and denmark too ? 
  no , the `` kick '' is n't motivated by this sole criteria . 
   and as for the spying , every country does that . 
  i 'm sure the eu does it far share of spying too . 
  yeah , on a cynical level one could say it 's `` fair game '' . 
  but it seems that you missed the bit about `` sharing '' with our economic competitors . 
  as far as i can tell , no other european country is openly a member of a spying cartel that includes foreign ( non european ) countries . 
  what if , for some reason italy decides to spy on you and share the intelligence with , say , brazil ? 
  this would be a pretty good reason for you to leave the eu or to claim that italy should be kicked out . 
   and our atlanticism ? 
  why ca n't we both be friends with america and europe ? 
  why do we have to pick and choose ? 
  because you ca n't be friends with a competitor that may choose to weaken europe when it finds it advantageous . 
  and not being in the eurozone makes it easier to back stab europe when you find it advantageous to please your `` other friends '' . 
  and i do n't believe the us are you friends . 
  they are using you . 
  you are their eye ( and hand ? ), 
  on europe , that 's all . 
  yes . 
  i think we should even * kick * them out of europe . 
  to me it 's unacceptable a member country that could use the euro does n't . 
  the distinction between the eurozone and the european union simply should n't exist . 
  countries that still not are in the eurozone after multiple decades as an eu member simply do n't show solidarity when europe is all about solidarity . 
  in the special case of uk , they are also a member of the five eye . 
  they spy on eu member states and [ transmit their findings to their five eyes friends ] ( https://wikileaks.org/nsa-germany/ ) . 
  that includes `` economical intelligence '' , which means they give the knives to foreign powers to hurt the economy of eu members , and inductively the europe itself . 
  at this point , this is not even about not showing solidarity any more , this is ** felony ** . 
  uk should either leave europe ( and in this case i would be curious to see how well the us-uk friendship goes once they become far less useful to them ) , or leave the five eyes and join the eurozone . 
  see also [ the opinion of a pro-europe former french prime minister ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27e68h/what_rocard_former_french_pm_really_said_english/ ) for more arguments . 
   it 's hardly abuse indeed . 
  it 's not abuse , it 's just yet another rape of your privacy . 
  so `` completely standard '' that you do n't feel anything any more . 
  microsoft has the technical capacity to use cryptography in order to provide those services while providing strong privacy guaranties . 
  but they prefer to mine freely your data and sell the product to their business partners `` as necessary '' ( as they put it ) because google , facebook and al. 
  have shown that it 's way more lucrative than selling operating systems . 
  oh , and your `` just disable it if you do n't like it '' stance is incredibly naive . 
  between intentionally obfuscated user interfaces , deliberately misleading captions , `` oh sorry we have a little bug here '' excuses , ... 
  the option screen only gives you the illusion of control . 
  do you have something like ( the former ) charlie hebdo in your country ? 
  for us , the revolution is the symbol of the violent rejection of oppression and dictatorship . 
  it also led us to democracy and to the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , which inspired the united nations universal declaration of human rights . 
  the rest is viewed , i believe , as `` collateral damage '' . 
  would we do it again ? 
  i hope so . 
  a propos , i 'd like to quote one of its articles : * 12 . 
  no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation . 
  everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks . 
  are you drunk ? 
  he is so right . 
  this proposal is totally harmless ( except it would make it much more easier to spy on you , but we wo n't do that , i swear ) . 
  please vote yes . 
   the countries most like to survive climate change in one infographic . 
  europe does pretty well sorry but that 's incredibly naive , stupid and selfish . 
  agreed . 
  they are basically writing , `` whites are the best '' . 
  this is of course a tight rope because there are unavoidable logical implications to that statement . 
  they 'll probably get caught in the next episode , when they actually elaborate their `` program '' . 
  i had to ? 
  he states he is n't racist and that maybe he is less sensitive to racism issues because he is not from a colonial nation . 
  i tried to give him some context , not to convince him he is actually racist . 
  however i do have issues with his ( and others ) `` it 's not racist because i say so '' ` argument ' . 
  welp that might be part of the problem . 
   i do n't get mad when black people make jokes about whites that 's because it is not a symmetric relationship , for the simple reason that at some point of history one ` race ' believed it was superior to another one , and acted as such . 
  it had different effects on people depending on which side of the < sign they were . 
  til ` noiraud ' is not derogatory in belgium . 
   you are trying to rationalise irrational feelings . 
  no , i was stating my point of view as someone who generally is against the use of english words , except when it really makes sense . 
  i do n't know where you got the idea that i was trying to prove something . 
   you sound like a pompous frenchman . 
  well , thank you . 
   [ frenchmen ] do not want to adopt words that would succinctly define subjects it depends on with who you talk . 
  for instance , the verb `` to impact '' is more and more used . 
  we did n't have it , we only had the noun .
