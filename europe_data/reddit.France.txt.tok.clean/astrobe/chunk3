  if you talk to the * academie * , they tell you it 's terribad . 
  if you talk to a person that wants to look cool , they 'll squeeze it whenever they can . 
  if you talk to me ( who generally avoids the use of english words ) , you may hear me use it to describe a very strong and/or negative effect . 
  the word sounds french and it clearly expresses the concept more succinctly than the alternatives , so it 's ok . 
  personally , the other problems i have with people using english words for no reason are : * their accent is generally terrible so they generally pronounce them badly ( sometimes i do n't even understand the word at first ) and they make my ears bleed . 
  * ironically , they often do n't respect the meaning of the original word ; for instance people at work love to use `` software versioning '' when they actually mean `` software version ( number ) '' . 
  * this is often misplaced pedantry as they do n't actually know english very well , and their french is often lacking too ( poor spelling , grammar , vocabulary ) . 
  i do n't want to sound like these persons , and i do n't want to hear more `` franglish '' . 
  no it 's not :  the acad\u00e9mie is france 's official authority on the usages , vocabulary , and grammar of the french language , although its recommendations carry no legal power people do refer to the acad\u00e9mie 's recommendations for correct usage . 
  it 's a good thing to have . 
  however their work on translating english words is generally mediocre compared to what people in quebec do . 
  in my opinion , fleur pellerin misses an important point : the usage of english instead of french carries the idea that usa/gb is better . 
  that might be true ( for usa , that is ) in some way , but letting this idea reinforce by itself wo n't help us with our general lack self-esteem . 
  stopping advertisers from using cheap ways of looking cool why saying lame things ( toubon 's law ) is important . 
  it 's ineffective only because advertisers can sidestep it too easily . 
  half of what i read , write , hear online is english . 
  but i rarely have the chance to speak english . 
  i can understand why they might be shy about it . 
  this is especially difficult in the context of real time games in which you have really little time to `` translate '' what you want to say . 
  not to mention your brain is already busy , focusing on what 's going on in the game . 
  dat utilitarian perspective ... 
  but anyway , if you really need a reason learning where a quarter of the british vocabulary comes from may be a good one . 
  it should be noted that it already happened in the past . 
  firefox , libreoffice for instance . 
  alternatives to popular `` social network '' and `` clouds '' already exist . 
  it 's way harder for those apps to replace the existing ones because network effects and because they have ambitious goals ( decentralisation for instance is harder to do that centralising everything into huge server farms ) but i have no doubt that the foss community will come up with satisfying solutions ( they are already working on it ) that its members can adopt massively . 
  from there , all it takes is a few years before people outside of the `` geeky '' foss community get to know about those alternative solutions . 
  well , our language is n't distorted , tortured and massacred daily by billions of non-native speakers daily , worldwide . 
  the english you learned , too , will be instinct : one day , sentences like `` why u no speak english '' will be legit . 
   if the idea is to say `` kids must like the same fads and artists as their parents '' , good luck with that . 
  not at all . 
  french music stations usually air current french ( * ) artists in order to meet their quota . 
  this helps promoting them , which is exactly the purpose of the quota . 
  ( * ) actually french-singing artists . 
  some of the famous `` french '' singers are actually coming quebec , belgium or switzerland . 
  amusingly , singing in french opens a market of about 180 + million people worldwide . 
  then why the quota , you ask ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i 'd be curious to hear about the national versus international popularity of spanish-singing artists . 
  `` french '' is a * cultural * ethnic group . 
  nothing to do with skin colour . 
  case closed . 
   i do n't understand what 's wrong with that remark the problem is the implications of the claim : if france is a country of white race , it implies that if you 're not white , you are not french - or `` less french '' , or a second class french citizen . 
  insular species are smaller , that 's a fact . 
  but as a human , you can use tools to overcome your shortcomings . 
  `` yay , one stone two birds ! '', 
  * a furore normannorum libera nos , domine . 
  i think those to blame are less the people going on strike than the mps and the government . 
  they underestimated once again how many people they would make angry with this law ; they probably ignored the warnings from unions as well . 
  it 's important to remember that people that go on strike are obviously not paid , so it 's not like kids skipping classes . 
  to go on strike is an individual decision ; the cgt can advise its members to go on strike , but it can not command them to do that . 
  it 's * because * a lot of the members of the cgt agree with their union that they could block so many newspaper . 
  it does exist for sensitive functions like firemen , policemen , etc. 
  but extending it further than that is likely to be abused , because everyone depends on others these days . 
  to be blunt , forcing people to work is a dumb answer . 
  because what will happen is that people sure will go to work , but do their job very slowly , poorly or not at all ( when the boss is n't watching ) . 
  it would just anger people more and turn things into a passive-aggressive situation . 
   in fact what they 're doing is illegal . 
  no it 's not . 
  what is illegal in our country is to actively prevent others from working , like denying access to a plant . 
  `` cgt blocks all newspapers '' because their workers do n't do their job because they are on strike . 
  learning french for an english speaker is like learning latin for a french speaker . 
  australia is interested in french . 
  those guys have too much free time . 
  yep . 
  a good special effect is a special effect one does n't see . 
  the cartoon is [ spartakus and the sun beneath the sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spartakus_and_the_sun_beneath_the_sea ) . 
  in the eighties , france enjoyed several interesting cartoons , in particular the [ once upon a time ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/once_upon_a_time ... ) series , which were both educational and entertaining . 
   nah you are an oss jihadist so there is no point in this discussion whatsoever more name calling . 
  it 's quite amusing to be called a terrorist by someone who stubbornly stick to his beliefs despite the discrepancies . 
   anyway linux is an operating system like any other [ ... ] and it certainly is not a best tool for the job in a lot of cases . 
  sure , yeah . 
  linux has no place in servers and in embedded devices . 
  on the desktop and palmtop , ubuntu and android never existed . 
  and i guess you believe it 's certainly common for an os to run on intel , arm , motorola , mips ... just add [ the figures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usage_share_of_operating_systems ) , and you 'll find that `` almost everyone switched to ( some linux derivative ) and the rest is just cosmetics '' if you do n't mind me stealing your words . 
   it is incredibly expensive to support multiple platforms and catch all the edge cases more unsupported claims . 
  do n't you find it bizarre that although supporting multiple platforms is supposedly `` incredibly expensive '' , yet there are billions of foss projects that are multi-platform ? 
  foss programmers must be super heroes i guess . 
   sorry i do not have time to argue with ignorant people like you right ... name calling and running away . 
  typical strategy of those who have week arguments . 
  `` shitty '' web user/developer experience has more to do with ads , `` shitty '' technologies ( html/css/js was not designed for apps , hence the pain ) and browser wars than anything else ( except perhaps the mediocrity of certain web developers but that 's another topic ) . 
  subtracting browsers from the equation does n't solve these problems , it amplifies them . 
  because you end up with something like an ie6 or flash monopoly and awful * de facto * standards . 
  diversity is what prevents that . 
  diversity causes fragmentation , and sure fragmentation has some downsides , but calling it * a * disadvantage is quite a narrow view to say the least . 
  `` everyone '' ? 
  who is that ? 
  `` cost ineffective '' ? 
  do you have figures to back up those claims ? 
  do you really claim that , for instance , being able to choose the browser you prefer is a disadvantage ? 
  what you call `` intuitive '' is actually `` familiarity '' . 
  linux has a major advantage , though : there are dozens of desktops , not just one like on windows . 
  desktop environment , window manager , file manager , network manager ... 
  if you do n't like something try something else . 
  especially the seine river that `` snakes '' from [ honfleur to paris ] ( http://www.pnr-seine-normande.com/carteinteractive.php ) . 
  it offers many [ beautiful landscapes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riqpxl8ilhm ) ( note : the `` lakes '' you see in the video are not natural ; they are holes that were created by sand extraction activities that got filled by water ) . 
   i wonder if someone lives in those buildings . 
  why not ? 
  a few kilometres away , the [ old centre of rouen ] ( http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/normandie/2015/05/02/diaporama-rouen-bienvenue-dans-la-maison-qui-penche-716595.html ) has many tilted houses . 
  so safety was a straw man argument ?
