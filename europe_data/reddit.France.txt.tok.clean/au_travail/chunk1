corbyn does not speak alongside israeli settlers or invite anyone who might count as a zionist activist into the house of commons to present their case . 
  i 've never heard him refer to members of the idf as his ` friends ' ( note : i do not believe the idf is comparable to hamas ) . 
  likud have a decent democratic mandate - why does he not meet with them ? 
  because there are already people there doing that . 
  the picture they used for this article is hilarious . 
  is bias usually this blatant ? 
  this is the refusal :  faced with calls to reject both hamas and hezbollah on sunday night , mr corbyn 's spokesman issued a statement which read : `` jeremy corbyn has been a longstanding supporter of palestinian rights and the pursuit of peace and justice in the middle east through dialogue and negotiation . 
   `` he has met many people with whom he profoundly disagrees in order to promote peace and reconciliation processes , including in south africa , latin american , ireland and the middle east . 
   `` he believes it is essential to speak to people with whom there is disagreement , particularly when they have large-scale support or democratic mandates . 
   `` simply talking to people who agree with you wo n't help achieve justice or peace . '', 
  why did the article author explained the news event at the bottom of the article ? 
   bring far more happiness than any amount of money can buy . 
  this is completely untrue .

   forcing providers to monitor is very illegal under eu law : the e-commerce directive prohibits it and the cjeu has declared it incompatible with the fundamental rights to privacy , freedom of expression and freedom to conduct a business is filtering publicly available content also covered under it ? 
  the e-commerce directive says :  ( 15 ) the confidentiality of communications is guaranteed by article 5 directive 97/66/ec ; in accordance with that directive , member states must prohibit any kind of interception or surveillance of such communications by others than the senders and receivers , except when legally authorised . 
  but if the content is public , then the intermediary website can access it and therefore can be a receiver , which would make the article irrelevant .

  which gold medalists would n't get selected in the eu team ? 
  the athletes we would stop sending are not the ones getting medals . 
  they should stop following dumb american units and order by gold , silver and then bronze instead . 
  the medal table is ordered by the number of gold medals first , then the number of silver medals , then the number of bronze medals . 
  us sending out 6 teams would n't really matter , because they could only get more silver and bronze medals . 
  also basketball is the only sport where such a thing would happen . 
  usa still got only bronze at the 2004 bronze olympics . 
  they speak greek . 
  have you ? 
  macedonia was a greek region that got invaded by slavs . 
  thessaloniki stayed greek because it resisted to such slavic invasions . 
   thessaloniki itself came under attack from slavs in the 7th century ( most notably in 617 and 676 -- 678 ) ; however , they failed to capture the city . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_thessaloniki -- skopje was a latin outpost in a mostly greek region , before being invaded by the bulgarians . 
   because of the ethnic diversity of the population , latin maintained itself as the main language in the city at the expense of greek , which was spoken in most of the moesian and macedonian cities . 
  during the following centuries , scupi experienced prosperity . 
  the period from the end of the 3rd century to the end of the 4th century was particularly flourishing . 
  ( ... )  scupi was sacked by slavs at the end of the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under slavic rule in 695 . 
  [ 63 ] the slavic tribe which settled in scupi were probably the berziti [ 42 ] who had invaded the entire vardar valley . 
  [ 64 ] the city is not mentioned during the three following centuries [ 42 ] but along with the rest of upper vardar it became part of the expanding first bulgarian empire in the 830s . 
  [ 65 ] [ 66 ] the coronation of emperor du\u0161an in skopje , alfons mucha , 1926 . 
   starting from the end of the 10th century skopje experienced a period of wars and political troubles . 
  bulgarian capital from 972 to 992 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skopje#history -- as we see , the region got invaded by slavs when it used to be greek . 
  the `` macedonian language '' you speak of is a dialect of bulgarian . 
  there was no war involving fyrom . 
  macedonia is a greek region that got conquered by slavs , mostly bulgarians . 
  the athletes we would stop sending are n't the ones getting medals . 
  `` macedonia '' is n't mentioned in the treaty : https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/treaty_of_bucharest macedonia was a greek kingdom in ancient times : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( ancient_kingdom ) macedonia is nearly entirely in greece , and a small bit of fyrom . 
   amaury ( l\u2019\u00c9quipe , v\u00e9lo magazine , france football ) is not owned by a billionaire but a multi-millionaire and the source of the money was the newspaper . 
  i would add the fact that they own the tour de france . 
  current macedonia is in current northern greece . 
  looks like they failed .
