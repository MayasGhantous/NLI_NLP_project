  exactly the reason why i 'm not impressed by nordic countries , who are in my eyes very conservative and backwards . 
  + nothing i 've said was inaccurate : your economy is crap ( 10 % unemployment en rising !, 
  ) , just as ours is . 
  eh , the current president is definitely straight whilst the loser is gay , it does n't seem very realistic !, 
  i 'm not jelly , why would i be ? 
  butthurt , much ? 
  this is a discussion among eu citizens , there 's no need for you to meddle . 
  definitely . 
  the wife of the president of finland would run off with a poor ( because that 's what he is without his husband . 
  the man who he undoubtedly loves / s ) ecuadorian immigrant , seems very realistic . 
  you 're thinking of norway . 
  what in the world ? 
  all that for the president of a country of what , 5 million people ? 
  paris alone has more people than that . 
  i can imagine that it causes a lot of friction in a country with high unemployment and slow economy that is n't creating new jobs that much . 
  the finnish state needs to sell some of those mansions and definitely the boat . 
  edit : seems like i 've pissed off half of the finnish population . 
  i find switzerland , belgium and luxembourg the most interesting countries as they 're close to france linguistically . 
  the most boring country is probably finland in my opinion . 
  that belgium or a belgian scientist invented asphalt the entire world uses today . 
  yes , i have . 
  its nature is beautiful , yes but that does n't make the country `` cool '' in my opinion . 
  austria and cool ? 
  i never thought i 'd hear or read those two words in the same sentence . 
  edit : never mind , you did n't use them in the same sentence , i 'm relieved . 
  i do n't think you 'd want a bunch of spaniards moving to the falklands , do you ? 
  this is unacceptable behavior for a mp . 
  his party should distance themselves from him . 
  sure , we 're cool then . 
  is n't that what i 've literally said ? 
  holland is n't a country . 
  i 'm not representing the french state , sorry . 
  ah , thanks for the information !, 
  ... and i 'm not arguing , nor am i taking a position on that in my comment . 
  ** today ** one is legal and the other is illegal , hence his comparison is flawed . 
  you 're our smaller brother as well , you 'll join france too some day . 
  the netherlands being a dick , that 's new . 
  tax avoidance is legal , nothing luxembourg is doing can be considered illegal unlike the drug cartels in mexico . 
  either way , this might be a beautiful opportunity for luxembourg to join it 's bigger brother , france . 
  i 'm not implying any of that . 
  i 'm literally saying that she 's acting ** faster ** because she 's personally affected . 
  with a spanish credit card ? 
  i do n't know , it might work but i 've no idea . 
  there 's no netflix in spain . 
  how 's your comment relevant ? 
  obviously she 's giving an example in support of what the european commission is planning to do , i 've never denied that . 
  in the example , which is one out of her personal life , she 's obviously frustrated as geo-blocking affects her * directly * , and it 's here where my comment comes in . 
   even if japan and us do n't join , it should be a good thing , if anything , for europe and countries like south korea to join to gain a western foothold as founders in the aiib . 
  indeed , but i 'd rather have the us join as well as europe and south korea ( sk mostly only cares about business ) are n't strong enough to stand up against china . 
  i hope that washington will change its mind on this one . 
   `` i , for one , can not understand why i can watch my favourite danish channels on my tablet in copenhagen , a service i paid for , but i ca n't when i am in brussels , '' said ms vestager . 
  when they 're personally affected , they act very fast . 
  i 'm confused , are australia and new zealand `` western '' or `` western aligned '' according to you ? 
  the same thing you 'd say to fellow countrymen : `` shut up and stop seeking attention ! '', 
  dude , this is her country/continent too !, 
  `` enjoy your stay '' is something you say to visitors . 
   brugge oh god , how i love that city !, 
  we all know that france is the beating heart of europe . 
  i reject the blue banana , it should 've been a blue pear !, 
  it should 've been a a `` blue pear '' , that would 've included france !, 
  well , they are n't . 
  hell , they do n't even consider france to be part of said bloc , which is silly in my opinion . 
  most of us are broke college students who ca n't imagine to have to pay for their own health expenditures , expensive rentals , ... the us is , for now , unattractive to us even though it 's loved !, 
  your day is very easily made then , you 're lucky !, 
  there have been plenty of maps on here where the nordics were n't the best scoring countries !, 
  do n't fuel the hype . 
  mass german immigration would probably traumatize some people around here too . 
  gtfo !, 
  belgium , luxembourg , switzerland or germany . 
  they 're forced by their husbands !, 
  dutch men are * very * controlling and obsessive !, 
   the notion that scandinavia is especially progressive when it comes to gender roles these days is a bit of a smoke screen . 
  do n't worry , no one but reddit believes this . 
  he did n't get hired at the end and so now he 's threatening to become a `` eurosceptic '' . 
  the hr department made a good call , send his ass back where he came from . 
  never will i be jealous if an eu state or a group of eu states is loved abroad as i believe we all benefit from that !, 
  you do realize you 're talking to a french chick , right ? 
  we 're loved/hated in every corner around the world , not just reddit . 
   there 's no way in hell any scandinavian country can take up glorious france !, 
  and that still does n't justify the nordics being mentioned as belgium , the netherlands and germany score better than them . 
  why not say the low countries ? 
  only sweden scores * just * under average when looking at the per capita production of waste . 
  denmark is on the absolute bottom of the barrel producing the most waste . 
  the uk scores better than all but sweden . 
  ** average ** is what he said . 
  ugh , just get in line . 
  the nordics are insanely over-hyped on reddit ( the americans started it and , as always , europeans follow ) and there 's nothing they do n't excel in and beat the rest of europe and the world . 
  just let them have their bubble . 
  great !, 
  we 're now almost surrounded by countries that got their shit together , oh well , we still got italy !, 
  sweden was just blamed once , they 're not central at all in the blaming game : the us , the former ussr states and the eu are . 
   they need to do reforms but they cant because people are too used to benefits and easy work so the more are politicians pushing for change the more supporters le pen gets what people does n't ? 
  all countries above france have been reforming for a decade now , many of them had mass protest and deal with far-right extremist parties . 
  even spain is reforming and they 're dealing with new populist parties and mass-protest for the past years as well . 
  it 's , in my opinion , completely justified to call our leaders irresponsible spineless idiots !, 
  any intelligent and articulate politician with some charisma can explain to the demos why these reforms are necessary , people are not unreasonable . 
  unfortunately , it is exactly that what france is missing today . 
   many many french people are whining about non-eu migrants who are able to get into france because of schengen . 
  if france were not in the eu and decided to control its borders it would be able to do something about this . 
  no , we 're not .
