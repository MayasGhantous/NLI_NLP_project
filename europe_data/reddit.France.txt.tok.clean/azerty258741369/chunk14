  you 're a fucking idiot , there 's absolutely nothing more that i can say to you . 
  who else but rape victims will get triggered by a debate like that ? 
  why would they have people who 're specialized in traumas and have been raped themselves in that room ? 
  go suck eastern european dick somewhere else !, 
  if there 's one thing i do not tolerate then it is people trivializing rape . 
  who else but rape victims will find it traumatizing ? 
  seriously , go fuck yourself !, 
   katherine byron , a senior at brown university and a member of its sexual assault task force , ** considers it her duty to make brown a safe place for rape victims , free from anything that might prompt memories of trauma . 
  **  ms. byron and some fellow task force members secured a meeting with administrators . 
  not long after , brown 's president , christina h. paxson , ** announced that the university would hold a simultaneous , competing talk to provide `` research and facts '' about `` the role of culture in sexual assault . '' meanwhile , student volunteers put up posters advertising that a `` safe space '' would be available for anyone who found the debate too upsetting . 
  why are you people being so dickish about this ? 
  the article clearly states that it is intended for rape victims only who might get triggered during debates about rape on campus !, 
  you people disgust me !, 
  what in the actual fuck are you talking about ? 
  this is clearly intended for rape victims , you 're a fucking asshole !, 
   -3500 fpm 370 + kts meaning ? 
  we 're talking about an evolution that 's been going on for the last 2 years or so with malaysia airlines , air asia , some other asian airlines , german wings now ... 
  pretty sure the internet existed two years ago . 
  there 's not much news out there yet as it just happened : - http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2015/03/24/crash-d-un-airbus-a320-de-germanwings-dans-la-region-de-barcelonnette_4600118_3234.html - http://www.france24.com/en/breaking/20150324-airbus-passenger-plane-crashes-french-province-digne/ or try to find something via google news . 
  that nothing saying quote gives you the impression that it was society for international affairs who imposed these conditions ? 
  it was the sia that organised the event thus college security will communicate with them and not with her , especially when it is about limiting entrance to the - and moderating the event . 
  the sia then informed the speaker who decided to cancel . 
  `` iranian-born maryam namazie was due to give a talk to the society for international affairs on monday on ` apostasy and the rise of islam ' but decided to withdraw from the event ** after college security imposed `` certain conditions '' ** . 
   even if this resolution is just a token measure , austria , at least you 're not going in the same direction we are . 
  what ? 
  every single one of us in the western world is going in the same direction . 
  some move quicker whilst others go slower , but the direction is * very * clear . 
  ... and that would n't have been a problem if they demanded the same thing from the islamic scholar , as she explains in the article . 
  i see no reason whatsoever to doubt her story , nor can i find any rational motivations for her to lie about this . 
  ex-muslims , unlike islamic advocates are very dependent on platforms like these . 
  nothing in her statements is new under the sun or even sounds remotely unrealistic . 
  just ignore these irrelevant politicians trying to suck up towards their constituents . 
  there 's a reason why it 's only `` a call for action '' instead of something more drastic , it 's symbolic so that they can say : `` see austrians , we tried but it did n't work out !, 
  how vague !, 
  let 's all support ** a call for action ** . 
  sure , but who 'll listen and what action might come out of it ? 
  austria is n't going to do jack shit ( except for spying themselves on others , but that 's cool !, 
  to be fair , a society where islamic law plays an even larger role than it does today is even scarier . 
  they 're not american though , are they ? 
  pathetic !, 
  europeans are very spineless people , i 've already come to that conclusion . 
  edit : western europeans , eastern europeans do n't go for this shit . 
  i would 've expected canada to be a more popular destination for us emigrants . 
  is n't texas a minority-majority state ? 
  we europeans ca n't handle that . 
  the british virgin islands ? 
  that 's their spain + lots of mexican americans who perhaps return to their home countries . 
  i never thought the dutch were capable of laughing at themselves or their country !, 
  no reason ? 
  it 's to avoid the greek scenario decades later . 
  they 're mostly older retired people that move to spain to enjoy the sun and a more relaxed life . 
  i 'd , personally , move to belgium if i wanted to emigrate , then switzerland and after that germany . 
  `` so , eh , we will eliminate ` certain ' inefficiencies in healthcare and that 'll save us , ehm , let 's say $ 500 million at some point in time . '', 
  cypriots go to saudi arabia , wtf ? 
  you facepalm the rest of scandinavia !, 
  why do n't you like them ? 
  australia ? 
  they share the same language and culture with belgien , do n't they ? 
   but athens will not get the $ 7.2 billion ( $ 7.78 billion ) unless it presents a new reform list with more detail on the government 's plans and shows some indication the reforms are actually beginning . 
  what are the greeks waiting for then ? 
   this is what happens when you put in power lawyers and milton friedman worshippers , while china is governed by engineers . 
  get that bullshit out of here . 
  reddit really has a boner for engineers , as if they 're all that . 
  the average engineer does n't know more about governance than any other non-politics related university graduate . 
   surprise surprise , when one of your competitor is a government , you get bought . 
  the eu demands privatization while china natuonalizes the eu . 
  '' ** until 2011 , china was mostly a receiver of european investment ** , but then the debt crisis drove down asset prices . '', 
  so we own china , huh ? 
  that was n't russian ? 
  sorry china , that 's not something we do anymore !, 
  i know you 'd like that though . 
  thank god you wrote `` i wont '' , i 'd be waiting all day otherwise !, 
  in that case , can you give a shot of the inside of your sweet , sweet canadian passport ? 
  you can not take the czech republic without slovakia , sorry . 
  you 'll have to dump someone else if you really want the czechs . 
  luxembourg is n't a closed country like switzerland or norway are . 
  they cooperate extensively with belgium and the netherlands in their own eu something version . 
  we 're one of the most popular tourist destinations on the world !, 
  no one beats us in europe . 
  why ? 
  are you trying to copy his awesome sewing skills to make a buck out of it ? 
  really ? 
  i 'll have to pay finland a visit then when i can . 
  no one cares about europe , we care about the eu . 
  expect floods of americans , australians , canadians and your regular europeans during the summer !, 
  do all finnish men look so rough , tough and masculine ? 
  still does n't beat france , next !, 
  next time try to check amazon reviews !, 
  hint : they 're horrible . 
  i 'm not seeing any wine on the table , i would 've left at that point !, 
  yes , and ? 
  they 're regulated by the government and i 've clean water without the eu intervening , which is my point . 
  if you live in the eu and you do not have access to clean water , then you live in a failed region/state and it 's time move . 
  absolutely . 
  you 'll have 4 million left so feel free to pick the baltic states as well ( to bully russia , it 'll be fun !, 
  there 's no way in hell that i 'd ever need the eu to have clean water . 
  seriously this is ** very ** basic and something that a local government should be capable of handling itself . 
  i 'd move out if that was n't the case !, 
  you 've got the best , most relevant parts of europe !, 
  though , i 'd say dump the czech republic and go for ireland or denmark .
