  another random word : straight, 
  if the waterloo coin gets minted , expect every single one of them that enters france to end up like this !, 
  i 'm sorry , but if you depend on the eu to force your country to take care of drinking water than ** you live in a shitty country and it 's time to move !, 
  how dare you to attack the innocent people of norway ? 
  from my experience , people love to show off their passports ( if it is n't from a shitty country ) at airports !, 
  i can see a market for this ( primarily national flags ) , your product seems superior compared with what i 've seen before . 
  sure you do . 
  just go and engineer humor because germans in their human form suck at it !, 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  congratulations to estonia , you 've beaten most of us !, 
  if you ca n't see the importance of logistics in an economy than that 's your problem . 
  russia is completely irrelevant , i 've included them just as i included turkey and belarus .

  sorry , i made this one . 
  i know it kinda sucks and there are no excuses . 
  i blame the unions and their links to political parties . 
  source ( worldbank ) : http://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global?sort=asc&amp;amp;order=lpi+rank#datatable ** what is the logistics performance index ? 
  ** the logistics performance ( lpi ) is the weighted average of the country scores on the six key dimensions : 1 ) ** efficiency of the clearance process ** ( i.e. , speed , simplicity and predictability of formalities ) by border control agencies , including customs ; 2 ) quality of trade and ** transport related infrastructure ** ( e.g. , ports , railroads , roads , information technology ) ; 3 ) ease of arranging ** competitively priced shipments ** ; 4 ) competence and ** quality of logistics services ** ( e.g. , transport operators , customs brokers ) ; 5 ) ability to track and trace consignments ; 6 ) timeliness of shipments in reaching destination within the scheduled or expected delivery time . 
  do n't forget about schweiz though . 
  germany , netherlands , belgium and the uk are also the absolute top ** globally ** .

  pointless as in you swjs have no idea what school i went too , who the cleaning personnel there is and how they execute their jobs . 
  denmark is kinda known for its poor construction standards and infrastructure in western europe and scandinavia . 
  pointless and absurd discussion as you 're just speaking out of your ass . 
   the cleaning personnel ** at my school ** are you going to the same high school i went to ? 
  very much doubt it as your statement would be very absurd in that case . 
  i bet for every truck that drives on finland 's roads , there are a hundred driving in belgium . 
  only france and the netherlands can joke about their roads , finland needs to stay quiet . 
  the cleaning personnel at my school were lazy bitches , no way i 'd ever run around in my socks . 
  they 'd be pitch black the second they come in contact with the floor . 
  what 's so funny about it ? 
  i 've posted my sources twice now , i 've no idea why it does n't show . 
  just google it and you 'll find all the answers . 
  it 's a danish study . 
  `` my region/country is red and i do n't like it ! '', 
  we 'll take them in !, 
  i was only joking . 
  kudos to flanders for how strictly they follow the french model , they 're better at being french than us , lol . 
  we could really use a region like that in france though !, 
  that is because the dutchified french in the north demand all corporations to invest in their region instead of wallonia . 
  if i recall correctly , they 're shifting towards china . 
  poland is doing better than italy , a western european country . 
  the `` dutchified '' french that live in flanders are known to sabotage the walloon government , there 's no surprise there indeed . 
  look at luxembourg if you 'd like to know how wallonia could perform without the sabotage  . 
  if i could go back in time and i was in charge , i 'd ground his plane again !, 
  there was reasonable suspicion . 
  if poor bolivia ( oh sorry `` sovereign nation with rational policies '' ) wants to play a game with the big guys , they should accept the consequences . 
  exactly !, 
  we 'd arrest and extradite him the second he set foot on french soil , as should be done . 
  what 's so horrible about it ? 
   unless it 's total war , done brutally , i do n't think many people can take out the sauds . 
  the us is perhaps capable of this by supporting dissent and/or terrorist groups within ksa that despise the royal rulers . 
  it could use the same tactics it did in iran , afghanistan and latin america . 
  as we know , that does n't always turn out positively . 
   they produce the most oil , they 're the most influential voice on opec & ** they hold down a fuckton more groups that are slightly more crazier than they are , and worse , are committed to crusade against the west . 
  ** as could we . 
   i agree sweden is fighting above it 's weight in complete values , but should n't that be the aim of most countries ? 
  definitely , but you 're picking fights you can not win . 
  ksa could crush you in a heartbeat without the eu . 
   in my opinion , germany vastly outranks france in all political factors . 
  it depends on what . 
  european politics ? 
  sure , but not * vastly * . 
  global politics ? 
  nop , we 've a permanent seat at the un security council for crying out loud . 
   do n't really see how you can make a case that bundeswehr is less significant than the french army , either . 
  we have a blue water navy , lots of recent experience , foreign troops and such to give you a few examples . 
  economic , political and militaristic powers are things in ir though . 
  sweden does n't reach the top in any of those in europe . 
  germany has economic and political power , france has all three of them . 
  ** sweden is fighting above its weight ** . 
  you can not take up saudi arabia , do n't be so delusional !, 
  a country with a population of 8 million or so people , no natural resources and a small army , are you freaking kidding me ? 
  unless you 're planning to drag the entire eu into this , that is . 
  exactly !, 
  though the quality of life is better in sweden than in france but both are at very high levels of course compared to the rest of the world . 
  you just joined , wait a couple of years . 
  how 's that weird ? 
  hehe , you sound just like the flemish who blame every lesser statistical fact on the walloon . 
  i 'm seeing more dark blue than just scandinavia . 
  you 're pretty much surrounded by countries with a high satisfaction of life , both in the north , west and south . 
  germany makes them happy !,

  africa . 
  do n't you remember the good old times where we fought side by side against the germans , destroyed belgium , drank thee and ate snails all whilst having a good laugh as buds ? 
  something so intimate you have never shared with them kangaroos and kiwis , at least not on such a scale . 
  besides we share those values too with quebec . 
  or we could move everything to stasbourg ? 
  we have many unskilled immigrants in france ( yup , we 've did what you 're doing now decades ago , and so did belgium , italy , the netherlands and spain among others ) , have they moved to sweden ? 
  have they moved to norway ? 
  nop , they 're still here . 
  people do n't tend to move for no reasons to another country . 
  if they do decide to move to france , they 'll have a good reason for it . 
  if they 're moving here to be a burden on our society , we 're allowed to deport them right back to sweden under eu law . 
  you do realize that none of them actually do that , right ? 
  most people that move to other eu countries are skilled people who 're seeking to start a business or are offered a job in said country , and if they 're at that point , they 're more than welcome in france !, 
  yes , absolutely !, 
  keep doing what you 're doing , it 's awesome !, 
  just stop asking the rest of the eu to join in , we pass .
