  you do n't believe that you can be a socialist ( democrat ) and be against islam , as the canadian dude is . 
  you 've just proven my point . 
   is it the fault of finnish taxpayer that the greek state overspend and does n't collect enough taxes ? 
  as far as i know no one blames finland ( who could blame a country of 5 million people for crying out loud ? ) . 
  it 's either germany , the eu , the imf and at times , though rarely , france . 
  kudos to both of them for still being best friends even with a border like that . 
  sure . 
  perhaps spain does n't belong in that list but you 're kinda unpredictable at times , remember the gibraltar issue you guys suddenly brought up a couple of month ago ? 
  you 've decided to be a dick against the uk out of nowhere . 
  it depends . 
  be it islamic advocacy groups , be it arab nationalism in europe , ... 
  they all have links with either the labor party ( if they 're moderate ) or the communists . 
  a clash of two different political systems : that of northern european countries where governments abide by the rule of law and that of southern europe where everything is uncertain . 
  this is n't surprising for governments like greece , italy or ~ ~ spain ~ ~ . 
  it is for everyone else in western europe from france upwards . 
  * history * indeed . 
  both social democrats as extreme leftist groups such as communists ** today ** have befriended islamist groups all over western europe . 
  peaceful annexation . 
  glorious france would 've invaded finland if they ever tried that with us . 
  since we 're at it , we 'd burn down moscow too . 
  sure , pedophilia is a bigger problem among white men ** in freaking europe ** . 
  you 're not considered a socialist by western european standards , in fact , you 're a right wing nutjob . 
  edit : this is a sarcastic comment meant to criticize established european socialists . 
  i am in no way attacking / u/phallindrome, 
  the correct word is `` neutral '' , i 'm looking at you switzerland . 
   i 'm going to let you stop and think about this sentence for one minute , and then you can come back to let us know the logical fallacy that you 've discovered . 
  i 'm going to let you stop and think about how to have a discussion with people . 
  [ spoiler alert ] showing respect helps . 
  no true scotsman , yes . 
  a fallacy often used by muslims . 
  they 're easier to manage . 
  though i recognize the baltic states unique situation having russia right next door . 
   you 're being an asshole , by coming here trying to shit on the achievements of a small country that has been independant for a very short time , but has managed to make great strides forwards in most all fields . 
  it 's not about nationalistic feelings , it 's about celebrating the achievements of smaller players aswell . 
  i 'm celebrating the baltic states , these countries + poland i have the most hope for of all former eastern european states . 
  do n't say `` no offense '' if you 're planning to be offensive . 
   look harder then . 
  estonia beats france at pretty much everything except number of berets per capita . 
  sure . 
  you can believe whatever you want to believe . 
   maybe instead of being an asshole , be happy that a country that was annexed just 25 years ago and had to start from nothing is doing this well . 
  how am i being an asshole ? 
  because i 've high expectations for the baltic states ? 
  because i want you guys to do an even better job ? 
  i , in no way , meant to offend your nationalistic feelings , feelings that go against the spirit of the european union and this subreddit by the way . 
  oh , so it 's just a reddit thing ? 
  got it , thanks !, 
  yes and their hookers are probably , like in most western european countries , eastern european/russian/asian / african . 
  i 've read this a couple of times here , how realistic is this ? 
  is this just an / r/europe thing or are people from finland really interested in forming a country with estonia ? 
  have n't seen much from `` bestonia '' to be quite honest . 
  i expect more from a country with a population of just over 1 million that receives development funds from western europe . 
  morocco has been an ally for decades , even longer than eastern european countries who 're part of the eu today . 
   edit : also , judging all muslims by the actions of a few extremists is a shitty thing to do that 's like saying that we ca n't judge all nazi 's because hitler 's cleaning lady / neighbor / cook / road engineer / ... was a self-proclaimed nazi but had no idea what the nazis actually did and what they truly believed . 
  islamophobia literally refers to islam , not muslims . 
  we 're criticizing the ideology and * not * necessarily the people who 're following it . 
  switzerland is the quebec of europe to put things in perspective . 
   says the goddam french , one of the biggest weapons exporter in the world , that was the reason why the arms-embargo did n't happen for half a year , and ** who will go through with the sale of two goddam carriers the second the ukraine conflict is over . 
  ** something your morally corrupt country would n't do in a million years , if there 's money to be made , the swiss are there . 
  that 's the difference between france and switzerland . 
   'm not the defending that they greelit the deal , but all that talk about how to go fucking apeshit at switzerland and how we 're not the allies of the eu over such a minor thing is fucking ridiculous . 
  minor ? 
  this is n't the first time switzerland decides to backstab the eu and the west in general . 
  just keep doing your thing , switzerland . 
  just do n't be surprised it 'll eventually hit you in the face . 
  wrong . 
  the swiss side with the eu and the west in this conflict , as some swiss have said here as well . 
  what they think is that the rest will handle russia , they 'll just be opportunistic and make money out of it ( even though they hope that the west succeeds ) . 
  you ca n't be surprised that this causes animosity , not only with the eu , but also with the us , canada and australia . 
  sure , we 're so jealous of switzerland . 
   why do you think that so many people want to go to switzerland to live and work but you keep seeing hate and envy all across / r/europe [ 1 ] ? 
  newsflash : europeans go everywhere to live and work . 
  switzerland is n't the most popular destination , the uk and germany are . 
   switzerland is an example of how a small country can be extremely successful by just remaining neutral and handling business as business . 
   the problem is that everyone confuses our banks and certain types of industry with the people living here , as if you and i are somehow responsible for a ceo that sells guns to another country , or does some shady banking business . 
  well , the past referendum on the freedom of movement principle with the eu proves that there are lots of idiotic swiss too , it 's not only business . 
   just smile and nod , while being glad to live in switzerland . 
  they are the ones that hate us for not being us !, 
  are you 10 or something ? 
   / r/europe [ 2 ] is just a lite version of / r/european [ 3 ] sure . 
  that 's not what neutrality means , at least not in the world where morals apply ( hint : you 'll have to leave switzerland to experience them ) . 
  if you were really neutral , you 'd not sell arms to any party . 
  neutrality does not mean : `` i wo n't take sides but i 'll sell you arms if you want . '', 
  nah , we should just stop treating them like there 's a `` special '' bond between us . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , they 're not different than moldova or morocco in relation to us . 
   our banking industry only makes 10 % of our gdp so our success is certainly not merely a result of tax evasion like people in the rest of the world likes to pretend it absolutely is . 
  that 's the money you use to pump into your economy in the form of loans to start-ups and such . 
  plenty of sketchy businessmen looking for investments , they 're always welcome in morally corrupt switzerland . 
  there 's nothing extraordinary about switzerland but the will to do business at any cost . 
  that 's what makes your country `` exceptional '' . 
   parasitic country best description i 've heard so far . 
  money laundering , opportunistic and taking advantage of conflicts that protect them too ( the safety of europe is directly linked with the safety of switzerland ) , dirty business ethics , ratifying bilateral agreements and then wanting to renegotiate them out of nowhere , ... lol @ the exceptionalism part . 
  we can all throw our ethnics out of the window on do business like they do . 
   ok with me . 
  pretty sure that is n't `` ok '' with your country , something like that would hurt switzerland tremendously . 
   their politics seem to be 110 % about themselves though . 
  they do n't seem interested in anything that does n't benefit themselves directly and everything seems to be fine , if they can make a profit from it . 
  like , usa could make a fortune by selling arms to russian , north korea or whatever , but they wo n't . 
  they 're taking some sort of moral stance there . 
  switzerland does n't seem to give a shit .
