  money = money . 
  yeah but unlike denmark or the us , switzerland is neutral . 
  ha , i get you !, 
   chocolate eww . . swiss chocolate is sugar and cream , it 's considered an insult to call what they produce chocolate . 
  i prefer the real deal : bitter , dark chocolate . 
  the swiss are n't stupid . 
  they consistently side with the eu and the west in international conflicts as it is in their own interest , they share our culture and values . 
  what is a problem though is that they use the `` neutral '' card just so that they can sell things and do business with our opponents . 
  naturally countries will get upset by this , that includes canada . 
  you ca n't keep screwing over the rest of the eu and expect special treatment from us . 
  i do n't hate you guys but as / u/oodleplex said , switzerland is n't our ally and that 's fine but i 'd like to treat swiss as such . 
  really ? 
  i like harper for his aggressive stance against russia and putin . 
  i like when western countries stick up for each other . 
   switzerland is not an ally of the eu this . 
  i think we should start treating them as such . 
  they 're unpopular . 
  some people hate them , some generally dislike them . 
  i can tell you that that is n't part of the french curriculum * but * there are other valid reasons to show the charlie hebdo and danish cartoons in western european schools , they 're part of recent important events . 
   he in no way suggested giving muslims special treatment . 
  yes he did . 
  we 've a tradition of mocking religion in the western part of the continent . 
   all he said was that isolating and attacking one group like that because of their religious views is unhelpful . 
  pathetic . 
  are you honestly thinking that i 'd take you seriously after this ? 
  so we 've never mocked jesus ? 
  we 've never `` isolated and attacked '' christians or religious jews ? 
  if anything , this is a case of * equal * treatment . 
  not mocking islam is what would constitute * special treatment * and thus '' * isolation * '' . 
  it does n't demonstrate anything . 
  the sensitivities are still there , the government just decided to ignore them and do the * right * ( according to western philosophy ) thing . 
   and there 's plenty of muslims in europe not massacring non-believers . 
  ** sounds like a leap forward from what 's `` literally in the quran '' to me ** . 
  it 's not a leap forward when compared to the places they come from . 
   and about censorship and the like , let 's not forget that ireland banned monty python 's life of brian for eight years , not too long ago , because it hurt christian sentiments . 
  that 's wrong and they 've changed it . 
  there 's no need to bring up a mistake that 's been corrected . 
   social progress takes time . 
  ten years makes a significant difference , and while it seems like a lot , ten years is a drop in the ocean . 
  there 's no time so they 'll need to speed it up . 
  i 've done it , ayaan hirsi ali did it and i 'm convinced many others did as well . 
  ** there 's no valid reason for others not to do it . 
   as a former school student myself huh ? 
  are n't we almost all former high school students ? 
   people are imperfect , they modify religions , bit by bit , to fit their lives . 
  correct . 
  that 'd be fine before globalization happened . 
  now that they 're living in one of the most enlightened parts of the world , they 're expected to take great leaps forward towards us . 
   as much as i like slutty western chicks what ? 
  do you live under a rock or something ? 
  wearing a miniskirt does not make a `` chick '' slutty !, 
  learn some manners . 
   i think it would be very wise to ban the miniskirts as they 're bad for your health how are they bad for one 's health ? 
  surely they are n't as bad as drinking alcohol , unhealthy foods or smoking tobacco . 
   also lol @ your logic . 
   these news are way overblown by the media , who make it sound like all danes want to defame and ** provoke the muslim community ** . 
  why stop there then ? 
  let 's expand your logic !, 
  whenever i wear a miniskirt i 'm provoking muslims , i deserve to be spit on and called a white whore that deserves to be raped . 
  i ca n't wait for the french government to make laws that prohibit me from wearing miniskirts in certain muslim neighborhoods !, 
  we can not provoke them . 
  throw up then . 
   you also implied that islamic fundamentalism is new to europe . 
  it 's not . 
  i 've not only implied it , i 'm specifically saying it : islamic fundamentalism and internal islamic conflicts are \u00a8 ** new ** to western europe ( excluding the iberian peninsula ) . 
  i 'm specifically discussing internal islamic conflict in europe . 
  christian conflicts have been a continuum in europe throughout history as it has been present on this continent for a long time . 
  your `` whataboutism '' is pathetic , if not , incredibly idiotic . 
  what a spineless thing to do , pathetic !, 
  could you imagine reading something like this 50 years ago ? 
  the uk ( and the rest of w-europe for that matter ) starts to look more and more like the islamic world . 
  perhaps the uk should apply to become a member of the organisation of islamic cooperation . 
  exactly and i defend germany in those cases as well ( and it happens a lot the past years ) . 
  you 're talking to liberal german high school kids , just let them be . 
  #snowden #nsa ** on a more serious note : there 's not a hair on the heads of the german and european political class that even thinks about breaking the special bonds with the us . 
   but that 's about it . 
  absolute bullshit !, 
  the anti-americanism is strong here . 
  what a waste of a thread . 
  you can brake your ties with the us if you want , do n't expect the rest of the eu to do the same . 
  your idiotic and inexperienced foreign policy does n't have to be ours . 
  do n't like it ? 
  ** leave the eu and join your russian friends . 
  ** getting real tired of germans and the idiocy they push on the rest of europe !, 
   or better yet , wallonia joins france and ends the unhappy marriage . 
  the first sensible thing you 've said all day . 
  flanders can do whatever ( hint : they also eat frogs ) . 
   ** bilingualism levels of people **, 
  wrong . 
  unlike discussing bilingualism levels of people , french is a `` belgian thing '' in that it is an official language written down in the country 's constitution . 
  minority/majority are n't relevant . 
  what in the world ? 
  you said that being bilingual equals being belgian . 
  well , if the majority of belgians are n't able to converse in at least two official belgian languages then being bilingual is n't a `` belgian '' thing . 
  that 's what people call a * logical * conclusion . 
   you 're getting quite desperate here , i hold no sympathy towards the flemish nationalist movement whatsoever . 
  trying to present me as some sort of radicalist is just pathetic . 
  `` this '' refers to the belgian - dutch agreement to work together . 
  i 'm not discussing you , do n't be so narcissistic . 
  all i 've said is that the agreement has the antwerp mayor 's name written all over it .
