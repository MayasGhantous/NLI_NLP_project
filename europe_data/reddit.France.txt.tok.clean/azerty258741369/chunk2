  irrelevant as fuck in politics but also culturally . 
  sweden does n't mean anything , at all . 
  `` per capita '' , yeah that 's not that hard when there are only 8 million or so capita . 
  what in the world is sweden exporting ? 
  you 're talking out of your ass , as if you 've some objective data to say what you 've just said . 
  fyi polandball ( which is dominated by swedes ) and / r/europe is n't the world . 
  sweden is irrelevant . 
  always has been , always will be . 
  again , france !, 
   i doubt nato would risk investing its hq into such ** a fickle member . 
  ** i 'm sorry but we 're talking about france here , the second most powerful member of nato !, 
  we are n't an irrelevant country like sweden or bulgaria . 
  can you just let finland have this one little thing , please ? 
  i see that you 've read my comment [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37z6v6/hey_reurope_lets_share_some_tils_or_other_facts/crr2db0 ) , thanks for your help !, 
   northern ireland pass !, 
  you brits always ruin our negotiations !, 
  * angrily leaves the room *, 
  i do n't understand how this building looks cheap or ugly , some people are mental . 
  unlike humans , france never dies . 
  france has to remain great and the shining beacon of hope in the world , our children can fuck off !, 
  france great , france stronk !, 
  i agree , being rational is kinda frenchy . 
  ignore us ? 
  yeah , that does n't happen . 
  wait ?!, 
  so the uk is our ex - ** girlfriend ** and germany is our current ** boyfriend ** ? 
  either , we had a lesbian past or are in a male gay relationship right now . 
  not all of it though , it 's a work in progress . 
  deal , if you give us scotland !, 
  wow , that 's quite a lot . 
  but what are we going to do after we 've aborted our child ? 
  how are we going to divide that sweet , sweet clay ? 
  that 's why it 's still alive !, 
  as they always do !, 
  at least we did a better job , our children are all developing countries or a minority in a larger country . 
  they 'll never out big dick us !, 
   if we steamroll through belgium we can destroy the nato hq on the same run sure you can , with your broomsticks . 
  the second germany invades belgium , france , the netherlands ( now relevant because they 've got more than broomsticks ) and the uk will declare war on you guys . 
  you wo n't go very far . 
   belgium is the result of almost half a millennium of british foreign policy . 
  they would never have been born if we did n't protect them from the dutch . 
  you guys just kept them alive . 
  such a shame swedes have no business in this building . 
  i 've heard the danes and norwegians will get some sweet corner offices though . 
   sevilla 's `` plaza de espana '' yup , i think i 've found my next holiday destination !, 
  all belgium 's neighbors are prepared to protect and die for belgium , it 's weird . 
  perhaps that 's why it is there . 
  context !, 
  we 're talking about gypsies here . 
  not all gypsies are romani people . 
  so again , educate yourself . 
  being a gypsy is more than just a race , hell it is n't even a race . 
  educate yourself . 
  black people in the us are just americans like everyone else . 
   black people oh , you got me there . 
  well yeah , they probably contributed the most . 
  ha , that 's nothing !, 
  everyone complains about it as well . 
  yes , it is a sustainable and environment friendly building . 
  it 's to meet the requirements of the city of brussels . 
  til , thanks !, 
  we ought to lobby nato back into france . 
  no one of importance will probably have to do that . 
  as is the netherlands , as is luxembourg . 
  belgium has tons of relevant international institutions , we need some too !, 
  you 've read correctly then , it is nato !, 
  yeah , the building needs to fit in the city it is located first and foremost . 
  ... and france is geopolitically more attractive than belgium . 
  i 'd say belgium comes 4th ( which is still an awesome place for such a small country ) in europe after france , the uk and germany . 
  the current nato buildings are those low buildings across the street in the picture ... 
  european , , canadian , and american architecture ? 
  what kind of abomination are you trying to create here ? 
  that 'd be one ugly building !, 
  we 've the resources and ability to protect nato and its offices against enemies . 
  why is ' t it in portugal then ? 
  nope . 
  not ever . 
  nope . 
   the new building will enable all allies to have the space they require ** and there is also space for expansion should the need arise . 
  ** sweden and finland ? 
  i find it beautiful , though i think france would 've been more fitting place for the hq . 
  love how we 're turning roles here ; we should n't beg you guys to join , it needs to be the other way around . 
  finland is not welcome in nato . 
  sweden is n't progressive as you guys think it is ; except for feminism , there is n't a single social issue in which they 're leading the world . 
  nope , you guys are n't welcome in my opinion without paying up . 
  we all , for example , just build a state of the art new hq building in brussels financed by all of us for which sweden and finland contributed absolutely nothing !, 
  i wonder how europeans will react to this . 
  will they , as an act of desperation and nationalism , voluntarily breed more ? 
  edit : never mind , you said `` if it 's ** not ** +33 . 
  10/10 would bomb libya again . 
   the only country that is actively trying to find a solution is sweden uhu , i trust that you 've looked at all the efforts each and every western european country has and is doing for the roma to make such a statement . 
  then do n't talk to me , i 'm not here to be `` pleasant '' . 
  you 're obviously here for karma-whoring , not everyone has the same goals . 
  no roaming costs ? 
  eastern european phone scam artists will get a boner when this goes through . 
  after they 've been here for years , indeed . 
  one can only tolerate so much . 
  10/10 would nato you guys again . 
  ignorant question but are there many muslim bulgarians ? 
  to be fair , many of them really are disgusting .
