  we welcomed them into france , they get welfare , housing , we force them to go to school to learn valuable skills and thus have a better position on the job market but nope , they rather steal , pollute ( they dump their trash everywhere ) and in general just cause trouble . 
  i think many eastern europeans were right about them all along . 
  what makes you think that productivity levels inevitably will drop ? 
  automation will take off as soon as there 's a chronic shortage of workers ; investing in it would n't be controversial anymore and a solid long-term investment . 
  unless those kids consume more than their parents did , which is n't unimaginable . 
  he would n't catch any `` drama '' if he did n't delete posts that did n't broke any rules , the exact same thing people hate that david guy for . 
  yes, 
  still making little mistakes , / u/slyratchet ? 
  oh , so now i 'm getting a reply from you , huh ? 
  who did it then ? 
  why did n't you care to reply yesterday ? 
  no , that 's not what happened . 
  it was on the subject about islam ( i 'm an ex-muslim and he 's a muslim so naturally we clash once in a while ) . 
  he replied to my comment and then deleted my comment because he disagreed with what i had to say , that 's unacceptable in my eyes . 
  i explicitly asked him why he did so and he never cared to reply . 
  you guys can keep him as a mod but he needs to be toned down , not everyone shares his ideology and criticism of it should be allowed . 
  why are you guys re-inviting / u/norrisobe again ? 
  the dude deleted a post of mine yesterday without any reason whatsoever . 
  i asked him why he did it and he did n't answer . 
  ** that was his first day as a mod , ** he 's spelling nothing but trouble !, 
  you are awesome though !, 
  yeah , yeah , i 've been hearing about your developing market for decades now , still have n't noticed anything significant whatsoever . 
  south korea did it way faster on their own , poland has the most advanced countries in the world by their side . 
  haha !, 
  stop desperately trying to sound as a western european country . 
  poland is a ** burden ** on western european countries , you receive tons of funding for almost everything : from your fancy highways to your local swimming pool and your new trains ( what a waste ! ) . 
  you have dumped millions of your workers all over western europe who earn money here and send it back to poland . 
  so once and for all : you 're not the uk , you 're not france , germany , the benelux , denmark or italy . 
  no one in power cares or fears poland leaving the eu . 
  ** edit ** : i just love the eastern european downvote brigade , keep the clicking people !, 
  were n't they part of the hre ? 
  - beating up austria = beating up germany . 
  - beating up luxembourg = beating up benelux = beating up france . 
  on a more serious note , those countries will probably complain in brussels and the entire eu will unite in defense of austria and luxembourg ( fuck the vatican !, 
  why the fuck did you delete my comment ? 
  oh our government pushed really hard to deny those claims made by fox news , did n't they ? 
  they did everything to convince the world but mainly us citizens that everything is alright and that they 're still in control of all parisian ( marseilles ' ) neighborhoods ; these camps are n't part of that , they 're mostly harmless . 
  the actual truth is that fox news was n't that far off . 
  really ? 
  i legitimately expected this from those idiots !, 
  there 's no sarcasm here , i 'm serious . 
  europe would be nothing without france !, 
  i 've never cared about karma if you take a look at my comments in the past . 
   still awesome though , just not that awesome !, 
  france is nowhere near `` bad '' !, 
  makes you wish we were your neighbors instead , does n't it ? 
  agreed , finnish men are hot !, 
  egypt and ksa , fucking hilarious !, 
  ha , the dutch always pat themselves on their back !, 
  it 's so hilarious !, 
  it 's the region , clay of superior quality . 
  flanders ( northern belgium ) even does a better job than the netherlands but they 're too small and part of belgium to score that high on the rankings . 
  oh , i just love you finns . 
  i wonder what i 've done that you guys adore me so much . 
  i ought to visit finland in the near future !, 
  how many has your country accepted , huh ? 
  it 's arab humanitarian values that is causing this mess , not european ones . 
  either way , no one cares about your criticism , they 'll eventually stop the flood , thankfully . 
  the iris are smart , unfortunately jealous europeans ( plenty of them on / r/europe ) are ruining it for you guys !, 
  uhu , the apple does n't fall far from the tree . 
  the world thinks we 're awesome as fuck , i 'm just trying to convince the world that even though we are awesome , they 're exaggerating . 
  we 're getting way to many compliment on a daily basis , that 's not so good for our national ego i reckon . 
  because we have no sense of humor , right ? 
  i kinda agree with that , actually . 
  nope , we 're the center of the universe i tell you !, 
  people * adore * france , we 're the center of the universe for so many people . 
  yes , that makes some people jealous but i know that deep inside , they all have a weakness for us . 
  you never thought what ? 
  that we are n't awesome ? 
  that 's impossible ( unless you 're a brit who 's hiding under a finland flair ) !, 
  who controls / r/europe ? 
  why is n't he kicked out ? 
  he 's clearly incompetent to mod this subreddit . 
  jesus fucking christ , you 're a dick !, 
  you have absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever !, 
  why in the world do we reject nationals of the world 's most powerful state who express a connection to our continent ? 
  that 's soft power , we ought to exploit it and not reject it !, 
  who is he ? 
  france is n't as awesome as so many of you guys think it is . 
  still awesome though , just not * that * awesome !, 
  ugh , why him ? 
  he only pops up to defend islam ( because he 's a muslim - i 'm an ex-muslim so we 've clashed in the past ) . 
  expect lots of criticism toward said ideology to be deleted or banned as of now under the `` islamphobia '' or `` xenophobic '' buzzword banner . 
  it 's an absolute shithole !, 
  that europe would be less exciting , less powerful and less cultured without france . 
   you really want to inherit belgium ? 
  who would n't ? 
  we , the british , the germans , the austrians , the spaniards etc. . we 've all tried to make them part of our respective countries . 
   you do realize the package comes with flanders unless you have planned some under the table deal with netherlands . 
  why in the world would i give the economically best part of belgium away to the dutch ? 
  never !, 
  prepare for invasion of your northern fellow countrymen !, 
  the belgians are pretty good at convincing the world that they 're pretty irrelevant , the evidence is your comment . 
  eu , nato , various other international institutions , high-tech industry , diamond industry , telecom industry that is a large player in africa and the middle east , vital ports for europe , politicians/business people of top quality that reach the absolute top all over the world ( eu president , un secretary general , the olympics , oecd , ceo nestl\u00e9 , ... ) . 
  you name it , they got it . 
  there 's a reason why belgians are the second richest people of europe on average . 
  belgium is the heart of europe , there 's no doubt about that . 
  see belgium , i 'm helping you . 
  now , join france !, 
  we are the most advanced railway country in europe !,
