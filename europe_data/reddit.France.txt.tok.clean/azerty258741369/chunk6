  conclusion : no one gives a shit , it 's just brussels . 
  europeans are mindless consumers , many of them already own a huawei phone . 
  our leaders are spineless idiots , unlike the americans and australians , so they 'll give the chinese easy and unrestricted access to whatever they like . 
  they 've literally brigaded this thread to downvote me , i 've never seen apple or cisco do that . 
  i 've no trust in them and i 'll continue to spread out that message in my country . 
  you germans are fucked then , god , what a pathetic government you guys have . 
   well sure , but when it comes to industrial espionage and political spying the u.s. are n't exactly our allies either . 
  they 're still our ally . 
   the government should protect itself from - any - kind of foreign interference and i consider cisco for example to be just as bad . 
  i agree with the first part of your sentence . 
   also , if we play ball with the chinese they might actually keep on continuing developing stuff for themselves instead of just blatantly copying , so for example , i consider huawei phones an improvement compared to those iphone knockoffs . 
  them developing their own innovative industries is the least of my worries , in fact , i 'd rather have them not develop those and simply buy european and western products . 
  would n't be surprised of my pathetic `` government '' is sheering for them behind the scenes . 
  i agree , au.ibtimes.com is pathetic . 
  in fact , australian media in general is pathetic , oz is basically murdoch 's playground . 
  brussels , belgium as is said in the article . 
  yeah , so i 've been told . 
   o2 going to avoid them when i 'm in frankfurt next month , thanks !, 
  i 'm more considered about sensitive information be it governmental or industrial than the chinese reading my text messages . 
  oh , look they 're going to locate themselves in brussels , how convenient !, 
  the eu and nato should pressure belgium into never considering them for any government procurements . 
  well , it is pretty silly to think that they 'll move the hq in brussels to romania . 
  perhaps the author thought that most people would know that it was n't about the actual hq in belgium . 
  no , the americans are our allies , even though they spy on us and we on them , unlike the chinese . 
  we do n't because we do n't want to lose access to their huge market . 
  at least the americans dare to take certain steps , unlike us . 
  oh , italy . . first work and finish the job then we 'll drink ( if there 's time left ) . 
  i do n't give a shit about radio and `` core network nodes '' , i do n't buy those . 
  they 've certainly improved at spying , absolutely . 
  the eu needs to , just as they did in the us , kick them off of the continent . 
  what are the chinese going to do , ban european phones ? 
  ha , good luck with that !, 
  they have n't formed a coalition yet , there 's no new government in finland . 
  i have never bought a phone from them and i never will !, 
  edit : the chinese , and their sympathizers , are brigading this thread so it seems . 
  i do n't think we care that much about what denmark does though . 
  we 're more interested in italy , germany , the uk , spain and the low countries to be honest . 
  i do n't want to dictate how you ought to live your life , nor do i want to meddle into your personal life but surely you must recognize , as a chemist , that ` time ' is hardly an excuse . 
  oh , you mean tolerate their existence and not go full genocide ? 
  yeah , some laws , certain governments and institutions might be against that , sure . 
  no one ever said that you have to be tolerant towards people like these , ever . 
  i hope your husband or wife does n't get to read what i 've quoted earlier . 
  you 're taking , at least that 's the impression i have , his/her psychical attraction towards you as a given , something that will remain constant throughout your marriage without putting any effort into it . 
   this is a genuine question : ** if you believe that europe is obligated to help these people ** , why force them to undergo the journey in the first place in lieu of simply allowing them to fly here ? 
  this question was not directed towards you . 
  they mostly get it from their parents - yup , the very people that left russia/africa/asia to have a better life . 
  the poor parents just do n't want their children to lose their `` russian '' values and culture , the only way they get to do that is by declaring said culture as superior . 
   antagonize flemings achieving that , which i 'm definitely not trying to do , seems like child play . 
  all anti-american crap gets downvoted into oblivion on / r/europe lately , i recognize that that was n't always the case in the past . 
  most of us realize how important the us is to us , we 're only jokingly teasing each other , it 's a / r/yurop v. / r/murica thing . 
  do n't get upset by this . 
  more than half of the eu is colored red for crying out loud . 
  you guys tried to tax fat , that was an incredible failure and international embarrassment due to poor planning and execution . 
  that 's unimaginable in france . 
  you 'd be laughed at if you 'd beg for freaking cakes . 
  the point is that one of the many reasons you might have a higher life expectancy is because the flemish have better access to doctors and hospitals unlike the walloon , who just pay your healthcare bills through taxes . 
  but the netherlands , ~ ~ flanders ~ ~ , ~ ~ austria ~ ~ and bavaria are colored green as well and their food is uneatable . 
  edit : scrapped austria because of schnitzel and salads , flanders because of lotus cookies and french inspired foods . 
  i 've heard that the flemish are a burden on the health care system in belgium , contributing less than your region uses ( going more often to the doctor/hospital and such ) so that might play a * very * small role in the calculations . 
  oh , how selfless of them . 
  got it !, 
  someone just posted this life expectancy map on here : http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_0yneoytm6ulccdkbsbzg8nrk21qvwqee.jpg it seems like scotland and wallonie are made for each other . 
  so the liberal democrats are the power hungry whores of the uk willing to form a coalition with just about anyone ? 
  it always pains me to hear french people , through history , being separated and estranged from their motherland . 
  flanders should be just like nord-pas-de-calais ( aka `` french flanders '' ) , a region in northern france . 
   also , we are used to having governments change over night with the new one being ready to meet the monarch by the friday morning . 
  even a couple of days to form a government is stressful for us . 
  which is why i 'm going to enjoy the next couple of days . 
   perhaps you misread what i wrote ? 
  i specifically said that scotland could join with wallonie and not france ;-) wallonie is france in my book . 
  we get to have some clay on that fancy island of yours and you 'll have some clay on the continent right in between germany and us . 
  who , except for the dutch , could be against that ? 
   as for linguistic nationalism , flemmish is one of the closest languages to english , certaintly closer than dutch . 
  i think frisian is even closer though . 
  really ? 
  i always thought flemmish was dutch and * very * close to german . 
   we 're also dismantling ourselves and becoming the new belgium . 
  how so ? 
  belgium has set the bar really high by having no federal government for almost 2 years . 
  you 're having elections * today * , i think you ( luckily ) have n't earned the right to call yourself `` the new belgium '' just yet . 
   maybe a better solution for all would be for england to join with flanders and for scotland to join with waloonie ... 
  i 'm not a linguistic nationalist so i 'm more than happy to welcome the scots and their homelands into france . 
  sure , you guys can have flanders ( anyone except for the dutch ! ), 
  but not sure if the flemish would like that , they 're quite fond of france . 
  they 're dismantling themselves so you should probably declare war on belgium . 
  lovely . 
  oh , you mean that weird enclave within the netherlands ? 
  you can have that . 
  apart from that , i 've never seen a dutch part in belgium . 
  if you 're referring to flanders , yeah , they 're ` dutchified ' french people , a cultural process we need to reverse asap . 
  indeed , it seems like the only people i hear complaining about bmi are those that score above 25 . 
  what in the world ? 
  are you drunk or something ? 
  just split up the continent and give it new names . 
   and yeah , ** when you 'll get laid no matter what you eat ** the motivation changes a lot . 
  yeah , i very much doubt that . 
  cultural = / educational . 
  jesus , just stop being a country , moldova , you suck at it !, 
  join romania as they seem to be going in the right direction . 
   i said i do n't think it is and that 's what i think because i know sweden has a very strict legislation on this .
