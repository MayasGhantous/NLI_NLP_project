  i 'm not talking about the government but society as a whole , there 's no need to work yourself up about this . 
  french society is reacting to this by demanding further restriction of poor muslim immigrants for example something that 's considered racist in `` the land of immigrants '' . 
  the unfortunate rise of fn proves that . 
   people love to bring up the fact that 40 % of our prison population is black as evidence of how racist we apparently are . 
  i have never , nor will i ever say that the us government is racist . 
  nor will i ever say that the white population in general is racist . 
  in fact , minorities seem to be more racist than whites . 
  oh please , are you seriously claiming that the us is n't hypersensitive when it comes to racial issues ? 
  sure , we have our problems as well but we definitely are n't afraid to grab the bull by its horn . 
  anyways , this is pointless . 
  i generally dislike people who deny facts for nationalistic reasons . 
  as i said earlier , i 'm very much pro-us so this is pointless . 
  it is definitely , without a doubt the entire country . 
  not really , notice how it just had to be an american who brings up the racial card in this discussion . 
  that 's true but the focus on race in the us is something that is widely spread throughout your nation . 
  / r/europe danes seem to have a problem with context . 
  it is something i 've noticed , the danish are n't the only ones on that boat though . 
  anything that comes out of denmark is by default superior and can not be criticized on / r/europe . 
  obviously i do not interact with the danes on a regular basis in real life , so i tried to refrain judging the entire country but seeing how you 're confirming this , i guess it 's just sad ... 
  racial focus will always be downvoted here and frowned upon in europe . 
  unlike the us ( a country i very much love !, 
  ) , we are n't tumblr idiots . 
  this is about a banking union , not the euro . 
  even the danes who have an interest in europe like / u/mrstrange15 suffer from a delusional superiority complex , if the eu ever federalizes , it 'll be without denmark . 
  fairly sure that they are protected in all of those countries , as i 'm sure they are as well in denmark . 
  we 're talking about progressiveness here , so yes , they are in fact more progressive than you guys are . 
  downvote for linking pdf file without mentioning it . 
  also , i 'm talking about domestic ethnic tensions , not those between immigrants and native french . 
  france has had political problems long before the immigrants over set foot on french soil . 
  i did n't say that she did n't thought that , just saying that how highly respected she is in denmark does n't matter to me . 
  i 'll look further into who she is but as of now , i consider her to be the worst eu commissioner . 
  so they 're more progressive than denmark . 
  / discussion http://www.businessinsider.com/antwerps-red-light-district-2013-11?ir=t, 
  i 've bookmarked it and i 'll read it but frankly , i do n't care how highly respected she is in denmark . 
  she 's now my commissioner as well , she now has power over me as well . 
  she is n't danish anymore , she 's european . 
  because that 's what we are discussing , taking things out of context seems to be something you like to do , is n't it ? 
  coincidentally , denmark is also the most xenophobic country of the countries i 've named , if not , of the eu . 
  i 'm talking about the treatment from the point of view of the government . 
  unfortunately , the netherlands and belgium were kinda lose with muslim and other immigrants that tend to be less open to homosexuality . 
   she made an example , so that it would be more relatable to more people , it 's not like she only wants to do this for her own good ... bullshit !, 
  they irritated her and she then decided to act . 
  if she did n't watch danish shows , she 'd probably not care enough . 
   and that 's simply not true . 
  if you had bothered to look into her political life , you would know that . 
  but you seem like the person that just read the headlines and then form an opinion anyway , so maybe i could n't expect that much from you . 
  thanks for the ad hominem . 
  no one cares , you 're still not the most progressive . 
  i 'd rather be gay in the netherlands or belgium than in denmark . 
  you asked about ethnic tensions , we do n't have those in france . 
  i was talking about the benelux . 
  belgium has the same prostitution laws as the netherlands , in fact antwerp is considered the best and most clean prostitution city in the world by some . 
  because she 's selfish and only acts when she personally experiences negativeness over a certain issue . 
  her `` i ca n't watch my danish shows in brussels , we need to do something about geo-blocking '' remark from a couple of weeks ago are still fresh in my mind . 
  i 'm saying that having just one culture ( 5 million danes , paris alone has more people ) helped your `` country '' ( = it 's basically a city ) . 
  it 's not the culture itself that made your city , oh sorry , country successful but the fact that there is just one dominant culture which makes it incredibly easy to run denmark . 
  if france had 5 million people and just one culture , we 'd be as , if not more successful than denmark . 
  i was more thinking in the range of euthanasia laws , lgbt-rights , drug laws , prostitution laws , ... also , the ethnic tensions in belgium for example are handled in the most civil way this world has ever witnessed according to many political scientists . 
  do n't even start comparing your small insignificant country with france . 
  the scots were smart enough to recognize that staying in the uk is better . 
  so the danes are stupid enough to vote against their own interest ? 
  got it . 
  she 's probably the worst commissioner in the juncker commission . 
  i have never been to taco bell in my life , they were just the first places that serve `` mexican food '' that popped into my head . 
  there we have the bragging again . 
  your culture has produced absolutely nothing , your small homogeneous population has . 
  your countries are just extremely easy to manage and run compared to the others . 
  denmark and the others have almost no international responsibilities , no internal ethnic tensions , no domestic economic disparities , etc. . . that is what makes you different from germany , uk , france and the benelux . 
  quite frankly , the later is more progressive than you guys are actually . 
  edit : love the downvotes , keep 'em coming !, 
  i know that reading the truth hurts your `` we 're superior in every single way '' conviction . 
  scandinavia has always been poor throughout history whilst we , the germans , the british , the benelux people were booming on all scales , industrialization started very late in scandinavia for example . 
  wars create complex societies , that 's just what we , unlike you guys , are . 
  we make their foods better , keep the country 's label and then they take the credit . 
  tikka masala , india 's national dish , is allegedly created in london . 
  ok , thanks !, 
  i just knew that one of the first person who 'd reply to my comment would be a danish guy . 
  jesus , is vestager a god or something in denmark ? 
  yeah , yeah , you 're the `` i love traditional stuff '' - type of person . 
  i get it , hipster . 
   the texas constitution requires me to say that texas is n't merely equal ** to other u.s. states ** . 
  so `` in that case '' just does n't make any sense . 
  what case ? 
  they are n't states of the us . 
  i consider chipotle and taco bell , to give you an example , as food places that serve american mexican food . 
  joints like chipotle simply are n't mexican , they are american mexican . 
  all the sauces , cheeses , the variety of vegetables and so much more are all american and definitely not mexican . 
  it 's like saying that my 4-meat , 6-cheese lasagna is italian , it is n't . 
  mexican food is okay-ish , american mexican food on the other hand , delicious !, 
   european union regulators opened an extensive investigation on wednesday into the way 11 eu governments ** subsidise utilities to ensure against blackouts ** , concerned that such support schemes may breach state aid rules . 
  because fuck those governments who 'll do anything to avoid a black-out , am i right margrethe ? 
  how are you going to watch your `` danish shows '' at home in belgium and denmark when there 's a black-out , margrethe ? 
   the european commission said it would ask ** belgium , croatia , denmark , france , germany , ireland , italy , poland , portugal , spain and sweden ** for information on existing schemes or their plans to set up one . 
  i hope that paris is going to give them the middle finger on this one , seriously . 
  and the netherlands even though some of you act tough . 
  we are incredibly above your weight , do n't challenge us . 
  western european countries ( all 28 eu members actually ) gave the eu the mandate to negotiate this . 
  unless your government is made up of retarded people who instantly regret decisions they 've made , they definitely want this !, 
  also , german delusional anti-americanism is n't going to take over the eu . 
  keep your hysteria in your own country , thanks !,
