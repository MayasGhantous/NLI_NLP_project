  the tensions were mostly present when bismark ruled , so until 1890 , because of the kulturkampf as well . 
  they slowly disappeared . 
  elsass-lothringen was still not a completely formed state inside germany , though they made progress there . 
  let me remind you of the [ zabern affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zabern_affair ) , no earlier than 1913 . 
   it was part of the holy roman empire before ever since the 10th century ad . 
  just as burgundy . 
  your point being ? 
  i gave you an example of two hundred years of successful integration to the french political landscape , and i also gave you an example of the lack of consideration and inclusion alsace got from the second reich . 
  in the end , it 's up to you to make your mind about the importance of language in the national construction , but it 's up to alsatians to make up their minds about who they want to build their future with . 
  that dialect would also be slowly lost in germany , much like french dialects tend to disappear in france . 
  and much like both languages are heavily permeated by english words . 
  this is a consequence of globalization . 
  it is funny that the french are alternatively accused of killing minority langages , and not speaking english well enough . 
  as for whether this specific region would be more true to itself in a country with close history , or a country with close language , it is debatable . 
  but the tensions between alsace and the rest of germany between 1870 and 1918 tends to show that the nationalist conception of a german elsass harboured by germans were not really tolerant of an alsatian identity . 
   it might be an injustice , but this is a similar situation as in south tirol , the borders are set , you have to live with it . 
  to whom ? 
   we germans who know germany and france know better what is good for the alsatians than the unfortunates themselves . 
  in the perversion of their french life they have no exact idea of what concerns germany . 
   -- heinrich von treitschke , german nationalist historian and politician , 1871 i 'm not accusing you of harbouring this thought , but alsace was a french region for quite some time , and fully participated in the life of france and its politics before 1870 . 
  some of our great generals during the revolution , or haussmann , the guy who built paris as we know it were alsatian . 
  i would n't mind to see alsatians join germany if it 's there wish , but establishing a notion of fairness based on some wicked nationalist concept is * not * justice in my opinion . 
  you can panellet warfare any time you want o / / i 'll send you my adress asap , 
  answer them that french wines are californian , because french vines were destroyed and we had to import them back in the 60 's . 
  the same way * creme brul\u00e9e * is french , m8 . 
  ^ ^ ^ shit , ^ ^ ^ wrong ^ ^ ^ [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tkrw7/how_to_annoy_europeans_with_just_one_sentence/ ), 
   how - you - i thought we were family ... we are , we are . 
  just look at our flags , almost identical . 
  this makes me think , diplomacy should seriously work based on flag colors . 
  this would be so much easier ... 
   ( joke 's on you , you messed up your flight and we get your tourist money ) typical gypsies ... ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ did ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ work ^ ^ ^ ? 
  ca n't piss a country that does n't exist ... http://zapatopi.net/belgium/, 
  it should n't -_-, 
  it can happen in stuff like sangria , or at cocktails , or wine served as a refreshment ( although it 's better to put wine bottles in a ice container if you want it cold ) . 
  never during a lunch/dinner , or with good wine . 
  * recoils in horror *, 
  the thing is , 300k more in paris ' subway would merely be a 8 % increase . 
  it would require significant work , but nothing of proportions similar to 300k more commuters in downtown frankfurt . 
  also , the paris region is already used to large population density ( afaik it 's , by far , the most densely populated area in europe ) , so this growth would probably not significantly alter the population 's lifestyle , because people are already used to it . 
  well , it 's probably the kind of alternate fact that the dm or the sun likes to gloat about :p, 
   thanks , / r/europe , for crying nazism and accusing croatia of being a fascist state thanks , / u/skyr3xx , for crying fake news and accusing / r/europe of accusing you , when in fact it was one post , whose top-rated comment actually adds context . 
  seriously , this is a discussion forum , you had better get used to seeing shitposts from times to times . 
  it happens for every european country , and i expect not to see reaction threads like this for every one of them . 
  french comment is n't really annoying . 
  if you want to _ really _ piss off french people , ask for ice cubes with your wine . 
   the french one is also wrong . 
  they would find that comment hilarious . 
  i know from experience that you can rustle les jimmies by declaring that english cheese is better . 
  this would rather get you compassion . 
  we all support your struggle to get ~ ~ foreign ~ ~ edible food , that 's why no one complained when you started building an empire . 
  i feel like you 're trying to plead frankfurt 's case with me , while i 'm merely explaining a situation . 
   well , it is not as dense as anywhere , is that a bad thing ? 
  if you 're interested in your lifestyle , it 's great . 
  if you 're interested in having millions of people work in the same sector , a low density means impossible real-estate prices and commuting . 
   where is it lacking in infrastructure ? 
  [ this site ] ( http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=317576 ) gives 300k commuters per day for frankfurt . 
  [ london subway ] ( https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/london-underground ) alone peaks at nearly * 5 million * users a day . 
  [ paris subway ] ( http://www.planetoscope.com/mobilite/443-nombre-de-voyageurs-dans-le-metro-en-ile-de-france.html ) is slightly above 4m . 
  and there are busses , trains , etc. 
  i hope you understand the difference here , we 're talking about an order of magnitude above the population of frankfurt . 
  now imagine that the population commuting doubles overnight . 
  i 'm sure you can understand that this is going to cause severe trouble : the public transport utilities will explode , frankfurt region 's car-commuting will suffer from lack of parking infrastructure and oversaturated roads , etc. 
  similar problems will happen for other public utilities : schools , roads , utilities , etc. 
  frankfurt probably does n't have the ability to sustain a construction sector large enough to fix this quickly , either . 
   there is a big airport . 
  that actually one of the things where frankfurt is up to speed with larger cities , indeed . 
  the rhein-man region is about 10 times the size of greater london , for about 70 % of the population . 
  it 's not a small region by any mean , but it 's certainly not comparable to larger european metropoles , whether in terms of population density or in terms of infrastructure . 
  the trouble with that is that uk has not had enough leverage to make it happen in the past , and wo n't get more leverage in the near future . 
   what they do n't realize is that the ceo 's and leaders of these massive forex and hedge fund traders could not give two shits if their grunt workers are stuck in a `` boring city '' currently working in cib industry : there are several desks in the bank i currently work for that are located in places because of one or two successful trader ( s ) that wo n't move . 
  what you say does n't reflect my observations , it very much depends on which roles in the bank , and what the power structure in the bank is . 
  also what you need to get is that frankfurt is not merely a `` boring '' city . 
  it 's a * small * city : the it sector in london is about the whole population of frankfurt ... that means that the quantity of growth it can absorb is limited . 
  currently , the way events unfold is that whatever staff is moved from the uk is not going to go to one single city , but may look more like a diaspora . 
  we 've already had some banks that decided to move to frankfurt , some to dublin , and some to paris . 
  also if us banks are going to split their staff across countries , some of these jobs may well go back to ny . 
  i specifically avoided the term country : in fact , it could equally apply to the drain from uk regions to london ( or from the french regions to paris ) . 
   so we need county by county social equitation policy , got it . 
  more insular we go !, 
  how is it insular to have these policies ? 
  it would indeed be insular to block freedom of travel . 
  but it would likewise be insular from the benefactors of this freedom not to give a helping hand to those who were left behind : this would mean the richer areas get to neglect others for their own personal benefits , overlooking the general welfare of the group of areas . 
   why do you think in this country categories ? 
  a lot people get way happier . 
  millions of people . 
  you can think in terms of areas if you do n't like the term countries . 
  yes , millions get way happier . 
  even more people are left behind , and the efforts they put in the betterment of their society is taken away from them . 
  and , once again : you can have * both * the individual welfare benefits of freedom of movement * and * avoid the bad consequences . 
  i fail to understand why you would n't want to have both . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you are saying it is worth to ruin countries in order to offer some people a better life . 
  it is not a discussion i am willing to pursue . 
  what i am saying is that it is possible to offer these people a better life * and * not ruin their home countries , by setting a geographic equalization policy between the country of origin and the country of destination . 
  i argue that such policies are currently not strong enough between european countries , and need to be bolstered . 
  these payments ( and the medical/infrastructure ` savings ' ) usually do n't make up for the loss of productive power , or even the investment of raising and schooling these people if there is no order-of-magnitude large difference in cost of life between countries . 
  i do n't say what you mean is not true . 
  i say it is far from making up for the brain drain . 
   but you seem to forget that the people that can take higher paying jobs are actually those who gain the most . 
  i fail to see what makes you think i omit this .
