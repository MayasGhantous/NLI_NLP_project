[ pierre billon - la bamba triste ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afeahcwamd0 ), 
  he reminds me this guy http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pepebreath.jpg, 
  yeah an article on french economy not full of old stereotypes and xenophobia is quite unique . 
  til , thanks . 
  and when it 'll be all melted , we 'll rename it whiteland !, 
  if my aunt had balls she 'd be my uncle . 
  their competitors are just asking that they abide to the same rules . 
  not respecting constraints forced on your competitors is for sure an advantage but it 's not really fair . 
  the only economic advantages uber has on taxi drivers are not respecting workers rights and not paying taxes ... 
  i guess so . 
   northern ireland secretary james brokenshire says london and dublin will share data to stop * migrants using irish border as backdoor into britain * it 's probably just the way it 's expressed , but there are 26 countries that might be concerned by migrants using irish border as backdoor into the eu . 
  where are his arguments , facts , ... ? 
  what a douche . 
  well , that 's a french not the frenches , and honnestly i 've seen dozens of all nationalities posting the same kind of comment . 
  why do this one is worse than the others ? 
  what does that even have to do with my comment ? 
  how am i acting morally superior ? 
  have you been drinking ? 
  our glorious leaders cheating on their wifes and frenchmen do n't giving a fuck . 
  yeah calling thousands of dead soldiers cowards is totally like giving shit to your drunk friend ... thank you for your service , 
  we 're lazy , france is a failed state , we 're cowards , we 're arrogant , we 're sexually perverted , ... well read your press this kind of joke http://imgur.com/gallery/0g9ws , http://imgur.com/gallery/b9zaf, 
  the frenches tell you to shut up ? 
  care to give examples or is it just once again francophobia ? 
  are they trying to make the separatists stronger ? 
  those damn mexicans stealing our jobs @ # $ !, 
  and his place is in jail . 
  i worked for companies in paris with offices all around the world where all mails , documentations , and basically everything written were in english . 
  ah the english civilizing the world again ... 
  france calls for nothing , a bunch of nostalgic monarchists does ... 
  it 's a surprise there are enough of them to form an association ... 
  you 're not a little hyperbolic , you 're borderline dishonest ... 
  it seems you have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_paris_region, 
  a spoiled brat throwing stones on a road sign in new zealand is world news for the guardian ? 
  i 'm so glad the wolrd is at a such level of peace today that there 's nothing more important to report . 
  i do n't think it 's paranoia , for the past weeks ( years ) british and american press have overstated the smallest incidents and make huge generalisation about all the french people being racist or agreeing with the bans . 
  the worst being those testimonies http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/world/europe/burkini-ban-muslim-women.html where it 's evident that the nyt did n't make any fact checking . 
  yeah let 's make believe the whole world that muslim women are spat on every day in france , that their life are threatenend the second they put a foot outside . 
  those lies will be repeated by the islamist propaganda and will participate in the radicalisation of some . 
  and some people will die as the result of those bullshits . 
  but that 's ok , you should never let pass an occasion to shit on france and french people . 
  tunisians voted for ennahdha after their revolution so his point quite stands . 
  care to explain how ? 
  so that we only sweat profusely and not burn during summer . 
  that 's precisely charlie 's spirit and the most adapted answer . 
  well done !, 
  it is not a law . 
  france is the boogeyman . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/10/english-football-fans-clash-with-locals-in-marseille-ahead-of-eu/  witnesses also reported fans chanting `` we love you isis , we do . '' how the english would have reacted , if french have chanted `` up the ra '' a couple months after a major ira bombing ? 
  there were also threats made that might have triggered some reactions : https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/1210500/english-football-hooligan-known-as-the-pig-of-marseilles-says-he-will-return-to-france-during-euro-2016-to-attack-muslims/, 
  walking stereotypes . 
  yes, 
  we refused to join the coalition against irak, 
  in 2003 americans pour french wines in the gutter . 
  i completely missed the sarcasm , i feel like an idiot , 
  that must be one of the most retarded statement i 've ever read, 
  brazil and the last hunger games have been filmed in les espaces abraxas in noisy le grand , i think it says it all ... and le pav\u00e9 neuf is nicknamed `` les camemberts '' by noisy habitants . 
  ties are like cow tails , they 're meant to hide the asshole behind it . 
  as we 've been repeating for years there is no 75 % tax ... 
  it 's steam not grass ... 
  that 's so disgusting ... by the way thoiry is not paris zoo . 
  the one in vincennes would be considered paris zoo . 
  well my statement was exagerated but when you come from a very secular society like france , israel seems very religious and tel-aviv is not the whole country . 
  i do n't claim anything ... 
  i just think that a quarter of them coming back is worth mentioning . 
  and lots of them leaved for economic reasons in the first place and not because they felt unwelcome . 
  now can you provide the numbers of jews that get back to france because they could n't adapt to the very orthodox israelian society ? 
  yes i deny what you say . 
  apart from sncf , ratp , air france and some public servants nobody ever strike in france . 
  and even them can barely mobilize more than 10 % of their workers or provoke an important disruption . 
  and as we 're talking about bank jobs , if you really think that traders and the likes are going to strike and oppose capitalism you 're not very smart . 
  august being off is kind of true but certainly not in investment banking . 
  we could also talk about englishmen productivity when they 're hangover after last night pub crawl ... ( every morning ? 
  i alsa have worked with brits ) . 
  once again you 're just the typical englishman regurgating rupert murdoch 's press propaganda because it feeds his xenophobic biais towards frenchmen and those lazy south europeans . 
  so we need to accept your hostile lies ? 
  there is the `` partit occitan '' but they 're more autonomist than separatist and make around 0 votes . 
  we used `` pouce '' or `` camp '', 
  there is absolutely no chance that m\u00e9lenchon 's voters endorse the candidate of the ps massively . 
  the ps has deceived them all the way those last 5 years ... 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about , are n't you ? 
  which labour laws are anti-business ? 
  which laws ? 
  ahah no , it 's just a translation of the french proverb : - si ma tante en avait elle serait mon oncle the more polite version is : `` with if ( s ) , you can put paris in a bottle '' ( avec des si on peut mettre paris en bouteille '', 
  a war ? 
  if my aunt had balls she would be my uncle ... 
  the only citation is : `` not in a million years , '' said a senior london financier . 
  another well documented and unbiased article by english press ... 
  i guess it 'll depend on uk 's behaviour during these 10 years but it 'll probably on the line of `` come in , you 're welcome , here is schengen and euro '', 
  is that a punishment ? 
  some cities are not at their right location . 
  clermont-ferrand is far too east for example . 
  this map is as accurate as a fox news map ... 
  seriously that 's the kind of informations we 're interested in ? 
  you 're a racist cunt mate and you seems to know nothing about france, 
  does the investigation on the responsibility of sergeant garcia ? 
  it 's a quote from oss 117 . 
  ren\u00e9 coty is quite the random president remembered for nothing . 
  it 's to mock the stupid chauvinism of oss 117 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgyxymjqcmm sorry i ca n't find a subtitled version : /, 
  can someone send him the memo about brexit meaning brexit please ? 
  not enough sunburns for them to be british ,
