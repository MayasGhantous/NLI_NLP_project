that makes one thing in common with the brits then . 
  and considering that napoleon is n't very popular in the uk , chances are he was very serious about his statement . 
  ugh , comparing napoleon to hitler . 
  what nonsense ... 
  i think that everyone with at least little knowledge of history knows about the french revolution . 
  but we are [ neighbouring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_martin ) countries !, 
  just on the other side of the world , 
  we call them * espagnols * . 
  maybe he meant normandy . 
  i think this was posted because the debris were found in r\u00e9union island , which is france and part of the european union . 
  but you 're right , it did n't happen in europe . 
  well , the champions are the danes i think . 
  they still have greenland , which is bigger than france 's and the uk 's antarctic territories combined . 
  bigger by land , but smaller by population . 
  \u00c0 la guillotine !, 
  actually , it would be half the size of corsica . 
  well , looks like it 's time to bring back the [ guillotine ] ( http://choeur-montjoie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/guillotine.jpg ) !, 
  maybe we can start by crossing the channel , 
  not my country , but still cringeworthy . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://youtu.be/ptu6grtepjy?t=50 ) the former belgian pm singing la marseillaise instead of la braban\u00e7onne . 
  that 's why a tie is called a `` cravate '' in french , it 's a deformation of `` hrvat '' . 
  hello , this is a map that i made . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://knoema.com/demo_r_frate2/fertility-rates-by-age-nuts-2-regions ) the source . 
  while the data is from 2012 , the latest one available for the uk and ireland is from 2010 and 2011 respectively , so it may have changed since . 
  some additional data : * the fertility rate of the eu is 1.58 . 
  * the lowest rate is the canary islands with 1.07 . 
  * the highest is guiana with 3.49 . 
  it 's french guiana . 
  it 's coloured since it 's a part of france . 
  brits joking about french food . 
  are you jealous or what ? 
  france 's population was ~ 29m in 1801 , gb 's ~ 10.5 m and the uk 's ~ 15m . 
  actually , napoleon ** iii ** reunited italy . 
  i remember also my history teacher telling us that the white is in the middle to symbolise the king being ` trapped ' by the people of paris . 
  the five overseas regions/departments are also not part of the schengen area , while being part of the eu . 
  ah , that is the only map i found . 
  looks that it has n't been updated . 
  edit : added russia . 
  meanwhile in france , there were only three kings between 1610 and 1774 . 
  according to wiki , only the first , third , fifth and last verses are the official anthem . 
  because while those are generally not sung , they are still officially part of the anthems . 
  according to wikipedia , only the first two verses of the poem became the official anthem , in which there are no mention of blood . 
  according to wikipedia , the anthem is based on the poem of runeberg , but only the first and last verses . 
  so the verse that you cited is not part of the anthem , which is why it 's not included in the map . 
  this is based on the official anthem of each country . 
  ( some countries ' anthems are based on a poem , so only the verses part of the anthem are counted ) . 
  here are the specific lines of each anthem . 
  ** for the sung verses ** : [ az\u0259rbaycan mar\u015f\u0131 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/az%c9%99rbaycan_mar%c5%9f%c4%b1 ) ( azerbaijan ) : * we will shed our blood to defend you !,

  freedom does not bloom , from the blood of the dead * [ fratelli d'italia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fratelli_d%27italia ) ( italy ) : * the blood of italy , and the polish blood , it * [ the austrian eagle ] * drank , along with the cossack * [ wilhelmus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilhelmus ) ( netherlands ) : * i have without hesitation , like a fearless hero , ventured my own noble blood * ( ... ) * nor wash their hands in my innocent blood * [ ja , vi elsker dette landet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ja,_vi_elsker_dette_landet ) ( norway ) : * upon the country olav painted , with his blood the cross *, 
  we have the same in french : * le chien aboie , la caravane passe * . 
  hi , what do you think of the french spoken in morocco ? 
  if you do n't mind the question , why are you envious ? 
  that 's just the land border that is the same colour as the sea , making it look like an island . 
  even your [ previous prime minister ] ( https://youtu.be/ptu6grtepjy?t=50 ) loved it !, 
  yep , and also france is the reason spain lost its colonial empire . 
  sorry for all the nappy phase !, 
  those are countries that have an eez larger than 1,000,000 km \u00b2 . 
  country | area ( km \u00b2 ) | world rank -- | -- | -- france | 11,691,900 | 1 russia | 7,566,673 | 4 uk | 6,805,586 | 5 denmark | 2,551,238 | 15 norway | 2,385,178 | 17 portugal | 1,727,408 | 20 spain | 1,039,233 | 30 [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone#rankings_by_area ), 
  are you sure about the napoleon part ? 
  wikipedia says that france sold st-barth to sweden in 1784 , well before napoleon came to power . 
  country : france favourite : brazil least favourite : suriname . 
  i mean it 's easy to be bike-friendly when the country is flatter than a pancake . 
  well , you can see guiana , so technically there is continental france on the map , 
  spain was the first empire on which the sun never ~ ~ sat ~ ~ set . 
  wait , so does your week start on sunday ? 
  it was marshall ferdinand foch . 
  but to him , it was because the treaty was n't harsh enough on germany . 
  hawaii is n't under nato protection , as it is south of the tropic of cancer . 
  that would be a bigger change than for portugal or the netherlands . 
  the eu 's * .

  that 's san marino , not italy . 
  like many countries in europe , they do n't have national mottos . 
  the uk has less timezones than russia .

  feel free to point out mistakes , as wikipedia might not be the most reliable source . 
  the colours displayed on the tower were never intended to be those of the winning teams . 
  not in the eu . 
  saba , st eustatius and bonaire are n't part of the eu . 
  none of the dutch overseas territories are part of the eu . 
  [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.hfw.com/extension-of-the-french-continental-shelf-november-2015 ), 
  that was true , until a few months ago . 
  the population is stable mostly due to immigration though . 
  r\u00e9union and mayotte too !, 
  the reason being that they 're the biggest contributors . 
  the big five ( france , germany , italy , spain , uk ) are automatically qualified to the final . 
  [ i did n't forget ] ( http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?p=cdg-run%2c+cdg-cay&amp;pm=b%3adisc7%2b%25n&amp;ms=wls&amp;du=km ) , the flight to st denis is still longer . 
  and for tahiti , there is a stop at los angeles . 
  $ 35 billion for a 200 km network , almost entirely underground . 
  that makes it $ 175m/km , which is quite reasonable . 
  i know , in this map i meant domestic in its largest sense , a.k.a territories owned by a country regardless of status within the country . 
  there are no flights between horta and porto .
