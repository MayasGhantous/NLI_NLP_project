maybe in the us , but not in the eu . 
  microsoft is not forcing manufacturers to bundle microsoft apps if they want to preinstall the windows store , which is what google is doing . 
  loan from a bank taking orders directly from the kremlin . 
  shh it does n't fit with their narrative !, 
  eu army is literally hitler amirite guyz upvotes to the left fucking cretin . 
  trump himself is part of the economical elite ( billionaire , remember ? ), 
  and media elite ( he had his own fucking reality tv show ) . 
  it is amazing that people manage to paint him as `` anti-elite '' . 
   everyone who was n't pro-trump were actively against him . 
  yep , that 's called a competition . 
  this is one thing , but trump and le pen are both pals with putin ( le pen 's party or associated parties even got russian funding ... ) . 
  [ it was certainly a close thing with a lot of discrepancies between the polls . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/uk_eu_referendum_polling.svg ), 
   everybody is so fixated on tagging extremists parties as the evil ones forgetting that it 's their fault that these parties are growing this used to be the case . 
  now every time the fn makes an outrageous statement and gets criticized for it , they claim they are being `` demonized '' even though the criticism is legitimate . 
  does this remind you of something ? 
   the experience of britain and the us should give pause for thought . 
  it certainly does . 
  i just hope the two-rounds system will be enough to get us out of trouble this time ... 
   who knows , we might get fn and afd in power before long . 
  cynical as it might sound , all i 'm hoping now is that trump will fuck up badly before the french elections , showing that the populist answer is n't an answer at all . 
   plus , the number is very flattering , the legislative elections that followed in 2012 , where we elect our mps , the people who , you know , are voting and making the bills that affect us all , only 58 % showed up . 
  well if it 's going to be a pissing contest , the last general election in the uk had a 66 % turnout ( better , but not by much ; nevermind that it is used both for the legislative and the executive branch ) , and the turnout for the us house of representatives was 36 % ... 
  why the fuck are mayors in charge of setting business tax ? 
  `` bureaucratie '' is a derogatory term in french too , and has been ever since it was coined . 
  it 's a play on `` bureau '' ( office ) and the suffixe '' - cratie '' which means `` power '' ( as in `` democracy '' = `` power of the people '' , `` theocracy '' = `` power of god '' , `` plutocracy '' = `` power of money '' , `` autocracy '' = `` power of one '' etc ) . 
  so basically a nation ruled by its administration , people sitting in their offices and disconnected from reality . 
  it 's not a nice word , the nice word is `` administrator '' . 
  and it needs to be available to every single citizen ? 
  why not just the fiscal administration ? 
  you think most people in corsica speak fluent corsican ? 
  basically yes , the main difference is that in spain/uk the monarch is not involved in politics and chooses the pm wanted by the party by default , whereas the european council is political and can negotiate with the parliament when deciding who to propose as a commission president ( good luck getting a majority of the 28 to agree to collectively mess with the parliament , but it could happen ) . 
  for example the council could theoretically refuse to propose some candidate even though the candidate is preferred by the party who won the legislative elections . 
   if they can no longer command a majority in the house , they 're gone just like the president of the commission . 
   you find yourself arguing that a commission or a president is the same as a pm . 
  you understood my point !, 
  look , you posted a long comment about how a confidence vote and a censure vote are completely different and whatnot . 
  i show you that , according to the uk parliament , they 're the same thing . 
  you completely dismiss that , and now you tell me that it 's still different because the pm has to command a majority in the house . 
  guess what , the president of the commission needs to do so too . 
  do n't bother replying , you simply have no clue what you 're talking about , and i do n't care about this discussion anymore . 
  feel free to bask in your own ignorance . 
   a vote of censure is fundamentally different that a vote of confidence apart from the name i do n't see the difference . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  your whole comment is just repeating over and over that the two are different , but i do n't see it . 
  well , i wo n't leave you hanging , maybe you can read [ this page on the website of the uk parliament ] ( https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/confidence-motion/ ) :  ** a motion of no confidence , or censure motion , ** is a motion moved in the house of commons with the wording : ` that this house has no confidence in her majesty 's government ' . 
  if such a motion is agreed to , and a new government with the support of a majority of mps can not be formed within a period of 14 calendar days , parliament is dissolved and an early general election is triggered . 
  i do n't think this discussion needs to go on further , unless you 'd like to show off your ignorance further . 
   save for the council replacing the queen if you ca n't understand the difference between , on the one hand , a ceremonial head of state who gets deposed the day she tries to get involved in politics , and on the other hand a council made up of the national executive leaders of the 28 eu members , i do n't really know how to tell you ... 
  imagine the parliament absolutely wants a certain person to be president , but the council refuses . 
  either the parliament settles on someone else , or a deadlock occurs . 
  do you call that an election ? 
  except the parliament does n't elect the president of the commission in any sense . 
  what headline do you think i 'm talking about in the comment of mine you 're referring to ? 
   you replied to the op with : `` except even that is not quite true . '' . 
  i presumed that you thought that the uk were justified in saying that the eu was undemocratic in comparison . 
  good thing i wrote a long paragraph explaining what i meant with that sentence , then ... 
   there is no difference between eu and uk since when is it `` my assertion '' ? 
  when did i assert that ? 
   the eu has given its parliament the additional powers of dismissing individual members of the executive nope . 
  the council can ask for the dismissal of an individual commissioner , and the request gets examined by the eucj . 
  the parliament is n't involved in that . 
   the problem with your assertion what assertion ? 
  i honestly do n't understand what your comment is trying to say . 
  except even that is not quite true . 
  we elect the parliament . 
  the council ( the 28 national leaders ) proposes a commission president to the parliament , who can agree or disagree . 
  the parliament chooses the president in the end , but can only consider candidates proposed by the council . 
  moreover individual commissioners are directly appointed by national leaders , not elected ( although they have to be approved by the parliament who can threaten to dismiss the whole commission , and the president chooses at will what portfolio to assign them ) . 
  try to fit all that into a headline ... 
  would be nice of you to read the article ( or in this case the infographic ) * before * spouting your ignorant opinion . 
  there 's a whole section dedicated to `` dismissal '' , and if you 'd read it you would have understood that the whole eu commission can be dismissed by the eu parliament , and individual commissioners can be dismissed by the eu court of justice following a vote by the council ( aka the 28 national leaders ) . 
  the problem is that you ca n't make a headline that says `` yes they are actually elected '' , you need to get a little into the explanation to understand . 
  but people only read headlines . 
  i think the eu will manage without your approval . 
  yeah but it made for a headline you 'd want to click so ... 
  mein kampf is not forbidden . 
  did you miss the story at the beginning of the year about the book going to the public domain and being picked up by a new publisher and so on ? 
  yeah this headline is not accurate at all . 
  there 's already [ a law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gayssot_act ) criminalizing the denial of crimes against humanity ( passed in 1990 ) . 
  in 2001 [ another law ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/loi_fran%c3%a7aise_relative_%c3%a0_la_reconnaissance_du_g%c3%a9nocide_arm%c3%a9nien_de_1915 ) ( in french , sorry ) officially recognized the armenian genocide , so denying that it happened is already against the law . 
  the new law this article is about is a law called '' \u00c9galit\u00e9 et citoyennet\u00e9 '' ( equality and citizenship ) . 
  * among other things * , it makes it a crime to contest the exist or the banalization of various crimes against humanity , with much harsher possible sentences . 
  it also contains many other things , and many journalists ( of all political sides ) are not happy about it , saying it will hamper seriously freedom of press ( for example , today if you want to sue a newspaper for slander you need to precisely say which part of some article is slander , and if you get it wrong your case is thrown out ; after this law , you just sue the newspaper without telling them what the slander is supposed to be , and the newspaper have to find themselves before the trial ... ) . 
  i have n't really followed the issue , but criminalizing the armenian genocide is only a side effect of a small part of a huge law . 
  this headline and this article are really misleading . 
  that 's not true . 
  there is nothing in the law in france today that allows for banning books . 
  or can you find a recent source ? 
  because there used to be a law for banning books , but it was repealed a few years ago . 
  they are . 
  or can you find a single credible french language source about them ? 
  it 's a badly bungled translation , reusing an expression invented by fox news to scare people . 
  what 's true is that there are place that are more dangerous for cops than elsewhere ... like everywhere in the world ... just think for five seconds , if it were a `` no-go zone '' ( a place where people and cops are forbidden from going if they are n't muslims or whatever crap fox news invented ) then what were cops doing there ? 
  what ? 
  source ? 
  just because it 's on a website does n't mean it does n't need to be sourced . 
  it 's all good and well to present data like this , but it could as well have come straight from my ass given how there 's no source whatsoever . 
  if i wanted i could fire up a website in a few hours with completely different numbers . 
  who ran the polls , what questions were asked precisely , when exactly were they asked , was it asked on the phone , by email , in the streets ... ?
