i hope you do n't mind if i add some informations : - ** a soldier died in mali ** : [ the sergeant was in a commando parachutist unit conducting an operation in the mountainous adrar des ifoghas region . 
  ] ( http://www.trust.org/item/20141029195242-saolj ) - [ ** aldebaran ** ] ( http://www.aldebaran.com/en ) ( a french startup based in paris financed by the japanese softbank compagny ) will provide [ 1000 humanoid robots to nestl\u00e9 japan ] ( http://www.nestle.com/media/news/nestle-humanoid-robot-nescafe-japan ) . 
  since their is a [ mutual defense clause ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/mutual_defence_en.htm ) for eu countries , regardless they are or not in nato , those 5 million people already have to be protect . 
  it seems that the ` muricans already released [ one ] ( http://www.terrafugia.com/ ), 
  so , putin wanted to show that the russian air force is able to go all around the eu in a single attack . 
  then , nato ( without the need of the us ) show him that russian air force will be detected and destroyed in all of the eu border at the same time . 
  i also remind that their is an increase of nato troops at the russian border and that the black sea is full of nato warships . 
  finally , it is also funny to see that those jets avoid french air space to do n't give us a direct excuse ( i do n't exactly know if the fact that russia enter eu air space might be considered by france as a violation of its own air space ) to do n't deliver mistrals ( and enforce nato divisions ) as they also avoid to enter in the german one ( it seems that putin does n't want to enrage the two core eu populations ) . 
  at the end , just keep calms guys . 
   do you think the uk 's referendum might affect le pen 's chances nope , but it if it leads you to enjoy the common market as a complete sovereignty it might leads us to want the same ( eu is not a popular thing anymore here ) . 
  [ oecd ] ( http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/economie/20130328.obs6031/l-ocde-met-en-garde-la-zone-euro-contre-l-austerite.html )  l'ocde met en garde la zone euro contre l'aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 [ fed ] ( http://www.leblogfinance.com/2012/05/la-fed-salarme-de-limpact-de-mesures-dausterite-aux-etats-unis.html )  la fed s ' alarme de l\u2019impact de mesures d\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 aux etats-unis it 's been years that every one ( you can see a imf and oecd critic of austerity almost every weeks ) but european commission and eu conservatives urge eu to stop austerity . 
   i generally prefer blue/green eyes as i said to a guy who answered to you , go to lyon . 
  it 's surprisingly full of green/blue eyes for a french south city and here , even the ugly girls looks pretty ( and you will like that the city is pretty inspired by italian architecture ) . 
  a rule that leads countries from 25 to 50 % of unemployment rate is stupid . 
  even more when imf , oecd , fed , the uk ( who do n't want to hear about such a rule ) are agree with it . 
  so , you think that it was better to be in polond than in france during the cold war ? 
  actually i do like the italians ones , but my favorites are spanish . 
   paris having been the capital for so long girls are even prettiest in lyon ... 
  you succeed to highlight the only bad point of russia . 
  lol ( from a south-east french guy ) !, 
  ** the uk ** i love you cause you are our best enemy ever . 
  if germany was a good challenge for us and , as you , a split part of the french kingdom , you were our world wide challenger . 
  from those old good days stories , i think you keep a risky , adventuress way of life . 
  i also like your humor sense and your tv shows . 
  finally , i still hate your politicians and french basher press but , you have my respects , gentlemen . 
  except if the rule is stupid . 
  here are `` p\u00f4le emploi '' numbers witch means they are the direct numbers of declared unemployed people . 
  this is relevant but not the some source than insee witch us the economics and labor statistics department ( so the guys that seasonally adjust statistics ) . 
  that said , the future statistics of this institute ( insee ) , however seasonally adjusted , will probably not be good ( just slightly less bad ) . 
  actually this stat is just showing the direct number of unemployed peoples , not a seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment . 
   as far as i know you export more to the eu than us , so yes , you benefit more from the lack of borders than we do . 
  but since when we need to be in the eu to do n't have commercial borders with eu ( e.g. 
  : norway ) ? 
   england and the easterners are doing well . 
  so lets make the uk pays a full provision to the eu and the ask the easterners to be net budget provider to the eu ( come on guy , due to the waves of roma we have here , romania is n't capable to take care of its own population and you believe that it 's france who need eu ? 
   france would be nothing without eu contracts and agriculture subsidies . 
  those subsidies will cost us 5 b $ less without eu . 
  you have to renew your declaration every months , every one is on holidays in august , the companies does n't hire and `` fire '' the non permanent workers ( and a lot of them do n't declare themselves before september ) . 
  so the main point is that is not increasing after it had decreased but it continues to slightly increase and will probably stabilize or slightly decrease for the last trimester ( mainly because of christmas ) . 
  my personal experience of how job offers appears in september for jobs in october/november ( to prepare christmas ) while they completely disappeared in june is a good testimony of when the companies hire or not . 
  it is a pick in number of unemployed persons , not in percentage of working population ( but it remains a bad stat anyway ) . 
   data from france 's labor ministry showed unemployment rose by 0.6 percent last month , after the modest 0.3 rise it experienced in august . 
  it 's not a big surprise . 
  it is famous that people forget to declare themselves as unemployed in august . 
  so they inscribe themselves back in september while the fresh graduated arrive in the ~ ~ unemployment ~ ~ market . 
  in the other side , companies start their recruitment in september ( it means + 100 000 ppl between july and september for +30 000 unemployed at the end of september , knowing that a la of people lost their job in june ) to engage people in october . 
  for my part , i apply for a job in the late september , had an interview this week and start the contract the first week of november , so i think the situation will be at least stabilized until january . 
  i use to consider france and italy as twins . 
  the fact is i see in italy all the bad things in france in worst ( eg : france has dsk having catch for sex in a ny hotel , italy has booga booga berlusconi ) . 
  that said , i do n't think one seconds that italy might be in a terminal decline ( does this newspaper know about northen italy industries ? 
   i write `` centimes '' on my bank checks my grandma do the same ... actually i think they care less and less of what we are writing in bank checks since i had some paid were the cents where wrote in numbers followed by `` cts '' . 
  we use to say centimes but we write cents . 
  as a frenchman i had experienced stupid taxes but this one is the stupidiest i ever ear of . 
  i see poeple doing this here in france and i do n't feel shock too . 
  what is socking me is to see an italian mate feel sock about it ( since when the hell italians feel so prude , they are suppose to be like us in a bit worst ) . 
   why do people abroad forget the principles of decency in general ? 
  alcool, 
  i imagine that they are under the french southern and antarctic lands label . 
  for what i understood , france considers that it will be a good balance for eu if france saves 50 b $ and germany invests 50b $ . 
  since this 50b $ saving is repeated every days since mounth here and that macron did n't talk about conditional saving : where the hell spiegel has found a `` only if '' in france position ? 
   but it would 've been better seeing something more current . 
  i am agree . 
  however , i do n't think their is a real superior country between french and uk economy in the long run . 
  if you look at [ long term datas ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:fra:gbr:deu&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:fra:gbr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-290480400000&amp;tend=1382047200000&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr&amp;ind=false ) , france and the uk use to switch their rank really often . 
  the only thing we can say is that the uk growth faster than france but france decrease less in crisis times . 
  on average , france and th uk are two european coutries with more or less the same population ans the same economy size . 
   she asked a story not be published `` because it would be damaging to the national security '' how is that not censorship ? 
  because if the nyt had decided to publish it anyway , the article were be on the news anyway , the nyt still open and the journalists of the article not in jail . 
  the day where rt/cctv or any russian/chinese puppet media will release a news like the water-gate is not for tomorow . 
  well if islam = isis , i will be proud to be islamophobic . 
  in a way , i think that this union insults the muslims . 
   serious question : why are n't we talking with isis ? 
  the fact is if we seal a peace with them , how can we justify to let them occupy territories in two countries ? 
  ( and i think it is a serious issue ), 
   for the eurozone it 's nearly 30 % . 
  [ you true ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=98&amp;ref_id=cmptef08323 ) about the numbers . 
  but he has a good point to underline that italy , spain and france weight ( around 54 % of the eu gdp ) is more important than the `` north austerity club '' . 
  i do n't want to be offensive but in term of industries ( midle quality products and midle price level ) and [ population growth for this decade ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03066/chart1_3066696c.jpg ) , you ca n't apply the german model to those countries ( while it match perfectly with north europe and the austerity cure seems to work only with portatugal and ireland who have the lowest pop growth of this decade ) . 
  so i think the problem of eu is that north europe believe their model works for moral reasons as a religion while it 's just working cause it match their society . 
  this merkel speach just show that she does n't imagine that things are not the sames in other countries than germany so it needs others ways to deal with ( witch is important since those countries are the major eu economic areas , if they fall down , all the eu fall down and it seems that german exports start to realize that ) . 
  the 7 percent in this article are also for the 10 years bounds . 
  to compare , the supposed french dying economy is at [ -0,006 ] ( http://fr.investing.com/rates-bonds/france-1-year-bond-yield ) for the 1 year bound ( let say free money ) . 
  however , i think this +1 % for greece 10 years bound is more due to speculation than factual reasons and they soon came back to the sustenable level of more or less 5 % . 
  i use to not be realy often agree we brits but trucidator is true . 
  sometimes , when i see the fn scores and knowing that france ( instead of germany a century ago ) is the new continental top birth country , i am a bit scare that we will become the 21st century germany of the 20th century ( and let say that poeple here have yet a lot of anger against eu and some of them a big sympathy for putin ) . 
   we now are firmly in the era of new and uncertain politic i sometimes fell that french debt real risk is linked with front national ( fn ) scores . 
  and let say that if fn pass a french president election , we are all cursed . 
  they are still far from their 34 % top two years ago . 
  since italian , spanish , portuguese and poles here became french a long time ago . 
  lets not forget their slavery rule that had produced as many victimes than all of the other countries together . 
   and criticize european imperialism as if the ottoman empire was n't comparable when it was strong . 
  they actually were a part of it . 
   parisians smoke and drink wine it 's akind of true for the entire france , except that poeple turn to e-cig within the last two years ( the time i checked , france represent half of eu ecig market ) . 
  by the way , i also think you should read a lot of `` free antiamericanism '' here with your us flair . 
  [ your comment is a valid critic of france without being franch bashing ] no french will tells you that france is pretty great by those days . 
  we just say that this is not ( by far ) the apocalypse everyone describe and that germany is not so great . 
  so , if you compare with all euro-zone countries , you are more lucky than curse to live in france . 
  also , i am not so worry about debt ( debt is almost cheaper than `` real money '' ) but , knowing france active population growth by 100 000 ppl/y , we need more growth . 
  i am a bit septical about france economy for the next to years but pretty confident for the long term . 
   it is you who is `` making a confusion between - and + '' sorry if i compared with the 2014 datas instead of your 2013 .
