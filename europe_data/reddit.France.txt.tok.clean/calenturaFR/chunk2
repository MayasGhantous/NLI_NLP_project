  how ever , france does not have a -0.1 growth rate for the third 2014 trimester as for 2014 at all . 
  to give you a look about old datas : http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryname=350&amp;querytype=view&amp;lang=fr then compare france to germany and italy and you will realyse that france is far better than italy and does n't have to be jalous of germany ( and itd even more true for 2014 ) . 
  i find that us , uk and german redditors are not the biggest french-basher here . 
  but your respective press start to ennoy us a little . 
   the french economy contracted by -.1 % in the most recent quarter . 
  by the way , your source is one year outdated and france finished 2013 with + 0.3 % ( to compare , germany was +0.4 ) . 
  french central bank predict +0.2 % for the 3rd trimester while insee predict +0.1 % . 
  http://www.capital.fr/bourse/actualites/la-banque-de-france-prevoit-toujours-0-2-de-croissance-au-3eme-trimestre-966787 also , your article just says +0.1 % . 
  that said , no one of the sources said -0.1 % . 
  making a confusion between - and + is a french-bashing bias . 
   basically every source has it approaching 11 % . 
  nope , only the ones that consider all the poeple who want a job ( even if they already have one ) . 
  the actual rate of poeple who do n't have a job and want one is [ 9.7 % ] ( http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/magazine/en-chiffres/chomeurs-en-france.shtml ) and it has decrease in august . 
   italy has similar numbers italy is at 12.6 % of unployment and already in recession . 
  france does not have a rocking economy by now , but if you need to cheat the datas to develop a `` france gona die '' point of view , it is french bashing . 
   you mean a country with a growth rate of -.1 % and double-digit unemployment is being criticized on economic policy ? 
  that 's italy ... 
  so being criticized according to the data of another country make it `` french-bashing '' . 
  starting from prostitute yourself as a boy and became millionnaire as one of the most famous actor in the world ; dawm , france is such a terrible place to live and to hope for a better life and future . 
  again ? 
  so how to compare a guaranted price hight than the market price of electricity when the price include the electricity production + the construction of the nuclear plant ? 
  if the uk bought the nuclear plant cash , their will be no surplus price . 
  i think this uk article focus to much in germany datas . 
  i had appreciate if there was some compareasons with france and italy to know if it is a germany problem or a $ one . 
  the french datas are not so great but the production as the gdp did n't fall down that much for the last 2 trimesters ( we are at 0 even if spain , italy and now germany are falling down , it is a really bad result but something is hapening in germany now ) . 
   if it 's negative about any member of the eu ( excluding the uk , of course ) and it 's from a british source . 
  it 's valid if the eu country is france ( we are in the border of collapse every weeks since ever according to your press ) . 
  but i also think that your press is well agressive with the uk too . 
  in this case , no one else in eu will notice . 
  first , i want to make sure that you hunderstand that i m just kindly trolling paris . 
  then if you want my honest point of view , the summer as been horrorfull everywhere in france but septembre was maybe the better mounth of the year , excpet for the [ south ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/video/2014/09/30/inondations-en-kayak-dans-les-rues-de-montpellier_4496908_3244.html ) . 
  this situation is really not normal for the south that are use to have 300 days of sun per year ( so marseille is like [ this almost all of the year ] ( http://mayeul.com/portfolio-type/marseille-in-motion/ ) ) that said , i m living in rhone-aples ( so the real south at all ) and today is the first raining day since mid-august . that mean that the trees are full of green leaves and this ( really beautyfull ) picture give me a feel of cold ( and we will have our 6 to 9 mouths of grey autumn and snowy winter ) . 
  edit : i just checked your past-post and i do realyse that you are probably french too ... so sorry for explain to you some things you already know . 
  yep , that 's why i am pretty sure this pic has been took in the middle of the summer !, 
   cryptocommunist communist using [ cryptonite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kryptonite ), 
  french from the south will says that in paris , there 's only autumn . 
  to compare , france , a quarter less populated than germany , has 133 000 homeless people . 
  it is twice less than germany and in line with the us rates ( france is 4.8 less populated than the usa ) . 
   that wo n't happen without structural rehauls of those economies spain and italy done that ... does not seems to work . 
   but that would not really be fair would it does that fair to let spain with a 25 % unployment rate while they never crossed the rules ? 
   but that angers protectionists like france ? 
   a compromise is to manage debt centrally , but that would mean all of europe having german accountants . 
  for what i know , this is france position and france is just after germany in terms of accounts for all eu . 
   it seems to be so-called conditional liking . 
  the old polish proverb says , it is better to pass such friends first . 
  so if you prefer to be alone , it 's better to be self financed and self defended . 
  does their is none old polish proverb that said that if you hate someone else support , you better to support yourself ? 
  pop ile de france : 11.98 millions ppl ; gdp 847 b $ ( 2012 , france : 2 600 b $ ) ; gdp/ppl : 70 701 pop switzerland : 8.081 millions ppl ; gdp 632 b $ ( 2012 ) ; gdp/ppl : 78 208 pop pennsylvania : 12.77 millions ppl ; gdp 599.52 b $ ( 2012 ) ; gdp/ppl : 49 260 at the end , paris area does not have a so big gap in population and gdp/ppl with switzerland than the gap with pensylvania . 
  so deficit is at 4.5 % ... so far than 98 % ... 
   ironically i was surprise of this move because i knew this court was made in uk . 
  that 's why i came to the uk sub . 
   it 's a european conspiracy to destroy our sovereignty , i tell thee !, 
  well , french feel more and more the same . 
  i sometimes think that france will leave the ue and the $ ( so desroy it and turn it to a simple common market by the way ) before the uk has its referendum about it ( and it will be our turn to destroy smt we create ) . 
   basically , the brits in this sub told me it was just a `` hey !, 
  ukip voters !, 
  i\u1e3f davaid cameron and i am saying that i will leave a eu more or less related thing in my next term if you vote for me . '', 
  answer . 
  a week ago i visit the uk sub and ask an elif ( explain like i 'm french ) about their move about european human right court . 
  i actually think that you are cursed for that . 
   and act like french . 
   french deficit reaching 98 % of its gdp leading to strikes on the streets for what i know it 's 95 % and i saw no ones in the streets . 
   they are the future -- of europe and the world . 
  the last time i had so much fun was when a french politic said `` without nicolas sarkozy , democracy were no longer exist in france , europe and in the world '' ( he gots the politic humour price of 2014 for that ) . 
   the average polish person loves free enterprise in a way that the average french person does n't i am sad to admit . 
  i lived in france for seven years , and they do n't get it . 
  for what i know , france is by far the [ world leader of enterprise creation ] ( http://www.captaineconomics.fr/images/juin2012/creation-entreprise-base100.png )  the people squabble over how to ` protect ' their rights yep as polish spent 50 years to eanr them back . 
  anyway , i do like poland and polish ( i just think your politics demand a bit to much without prividing anything ) and especially how you seems to be optimistic about the futur . 
   inflation , national debt and monetary policy need to be set as a national level because productivity , labour cost and fiscal policies differ . 
  actually i think that euro problem exist since the money value ( and policies ) are led by the average of euro-zone inflation and productivity cost . 
  in such a context both the size of germany and of its export industry bias the average while if the policies took a little care of the median , the euro might be more matching french , italian and spanish needs and i do believe that if those 3 countries recover their growth , their will be no other trouble in euro-zone . 
  i think it 's a good point for the dynamic of us job market and economy but i am not quite sure that 's one reason that make $ a not so good money . 
  anyway , you have the main point about the federal organization level witch does not really exist ( and miss ) here . 
   pennsylvania has the same gdp as switzerland so do has paris area . 
  in term of policies , in the us , each state does n't have to budget their own military defense ( france is a bit bored about being the single $ zone with a decent army while others just have us army , we can divede our deficit by two if we were at the same level than others ) . 
  also , each us states ca n't make presure on others regarding the way they organize their buget . 
  finally , us federal gov may guaranty federed government debts , that 's completly forbiden in eu ( the ecb ca n't buy back eurozone countries debt ) . 
  thus , in term of business impact , the $ is over evaluated for france and italy while under evaluated for germany . 
  that mean that germany exports increase the prices of french and italy products ( that becames to expensives ) . 
  in the other hand , weak countries as spain lead the euro a bit down witch make the german products really cheap . 
  so , by now , $ is only good for germany ( i think an independant german mark will be at 1.69 $ and a french franc at 1 $ ) . 
  at the end , we have a money that only supports the strongest export ecenomy with no collective guaranty . 
  the euro idea is not a so bad one but its organization is a mess . 
  we do n't ( as we do n't look at eu talks too ) . 
  nope , since france as cured a french humanitarian nurse , you just have to buy the treatment from us . 
  i guess peoples stay longer than in paris . 
  the survey use number of night spent in the place rather than number of people . 
  that said , it means that a lot of people spent one/two night for a week end in paris while less poeple as spent a week or two in canary .

  since their is only 110 % ... pfff, 
  first , it seems that the new and futur psa/renault models are designed with more `` muscles '' that can match with us market . 
  thus , psa/renault owrked a lot in electrics , hybrid and low consumtion technologies so i imagine they gon na try to touch the prius / tesle niche market . 
  some explamples of future psa/renault models http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1094787_peugeot-citroen-could-return-to-the-u-s-in-the-early-2020s http://www.peugeot.com/fr/design/concept-cars/exalt edit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttz_q9e31_0 http://news.autoplus.fr/news/1487089/concept-peugeot-quartz-vid%c3%a9o-suv-sport-peugeot-quartz-concept https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafevzdz33o, 
   british colonialism in china i mean the isolationim policies of china , who had chose to ignore westerns moves in the world . 
  china believed that westerner where just stupid ignorent and never imagine they might invade them . 
  as a result , uk , france , germany , italy , ... invade china . 
  so it means that every thing is your business . 
   the prime example for isolation and one of the best countries in the world belgium had felt a good smell of isolation in ww2 and china really enjoyed to be all alone far away from western imparialist ... until they successfully invade china .
