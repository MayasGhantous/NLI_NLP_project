   the thing is there will armed military troops to protect the guys who fly the drone fot what i know , military troops use to be armed ( else they will be called cheerleaders ) . 
   after all , ukraine is none of our business . 
  we should stick to our own problems instead !, 
  everything is our problem , that 's the problem . 
  actualy , renzi seems so similar to [ marc anthony ] ( https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mebmq8tgya1qhz1edo1_500.gif ) for me . 
   threaten them . 
  i am actually seeking for any good reason for staying in eu . 
  excpet for the single market ( that non-eu countries can enjoy anyway ) , what does the eu do to france excetp spending our money and complain that we do n't spent our money in the way they want . 
  so after he sents half of the ~ ~ red ~ ~ ~ ~ soviet ~ ~ russian army at the ukrainian border , he puts almost a quarter of his nuclear weapons close to norway . 
  well , at least it will need a few bombs and hours to vanish russien army . 
  i was looking for more details and for what i saw it is 0 % for the uk as for it is for spain . 
  [ source ( in french ) ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/economie/553699-unpublished-economie-en-france-moins-de-15-de-l-approvisionnement-en-gaz-vient-de-russie ), 
  unfortunately , their is no quantities in this chart . 
  thus , how each countries depends on gaz in their energy production . 
  for exemple , maybe france consume more russian gaz than estonia . 
  aslo , maybe france ( as estonia ) is not that dependant to gaz in general to produce its energy compare to italy . 
  edit : for exemple , [ france ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mix_%c3%a9nerg%c3%a9tique#europe ) energy depend only for 22 % on gaz in general . 
  that said , france energy depend just around 5 % on russian gaz ( i did n't found data for other countries ) . 
  [ i feel that guy as been well received at gare du nord ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey0wvgiah9g ), 
  is seems that gdp/capita remain higher in [ france than in the uk ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:fra:deu:gbr&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr ) and thank you for [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854xqcfcy#t=38 ) !, 
   andy street said france was `` finished lol , i feel that i hear an english man said such a thing since i 'm born . 
   `` if you 've got investments in french businesses , get them out quickly . '' [ it seems not so bad ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2014/08/20/la-france-championne-du-monde-des-versements-de-dividendes_4474014_3234.html ) in english  up 30.3 % in france it was in france that the remuneration distributed to shareholders fastest increase , with $ 40.7 billion distributed ( 30.3 % ) , making the country the largest dividend payer in europe before the germany and the uk , the study reveals . 
  so  `` i have never been to a country more ill at ease ... nothing works and nobody cares about it . '' if he describes france ill according to the fact that france is the eu most shareholders distributer , i confirm that nobody cares of what he says . 
  [ daft punk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nv6rdv1a3i ), 
  i will be agree to say that ireland had benefit from austerity when ireland had recovered here level of 2009 and paid her $ zone dept. 
  thus , every big compagnies will leave ireland the day one big eu country makes its taxes as low as ireland ( and if all of eu countries do , because of the language issue matter , england will the first benefactor ) . 
  also , ireland has a lot of eu immigrant and enjoy others countries education ( paid with taxes ) as their market ( no one really care of ireland market ) . 
  actully , it will hurt france to leave the eurozone . 
  but if staying in this eurozone mean other countries ( that we had bail-out for some of them ) want to hurt us ( with their austerity that had lead 25 % unemployemt in spain and a deflation of the $ ) , i think we prefer to leave and make every one hurt by the way ( if they really want to make it dirty , go ahead , we are not the ones who have the most to lose ) . 
   that 'll just mean that my tax money will pay for it !, 
  [ ... ] why should i suffer because they do n't want a pay cut ? 
  you do realise that you ca n't accept that french tax payer already do for your country ? 
  by the way , we can do a quit austerity bugdet by cut 19 b $ for the eu and even more if we stop to provide the financial security for weak countries . 
  after an italian tells to you and your friends that italy is wonderfull , a jewel , ... . 
  tell them that you are french so what you saw in italy was nice but not really impressive campare to your every day life standard . 
  then you had that actually all of their infrastructures look so 80 's . 
  he will ignore you and focus on your friend . 
  next move : let 's bring back the imperial army !, 
  brits , get ready to ride horses and to cross seas by woden boats . 
  forget about machin guns or nuklear weapons but bring your swords and prepare the canon balls . 
  i usually prefer montains than sea , but my foreign gf never see the sea ( yep , ppl like this exist ) , so i think we will go to [ menton ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/menton ) by making some stops in [ avignon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avignon ) ( pope palace , the bridge , the wall , ... ) and [ arles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arles ) ( coliseum and romain architecture in general ) . 
  then , if it was only for me , i will do a road trip in the alps looking for lost 12 century churches in the montains , full of [ peinting inside ] ( http://adret74.over-blog.com/pages/comptesrendus_des_sorties_nature_les_plus_recentes-5523700.html ), 
  i use to link forez with roanne or auvergne . 
  so if someone want to see livradois forez , i will recommand then to go to [ auvergne ] ( http://www.auvergne-tourisme.info/ ) . 
  the basilica of saint-denis with the french kings crypt . 
  edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basilica_of_st_denis, 
   is there something not to visit in france ? 
  saint etienne, 
  you done pretty well . 
  it 's a bit late so i ca n't answer you with the french point of view of this period if you have any interest ( ? ) . 
  thus it 's realy interesting to see how the birth rate of french or german may lead the entire europe fate ( the fact that we have children and you do n't is a key point about how french judge your way of organizing europe ) . 
  anyway thanks and i will give you a longer answer . 
  wow , i did n't expected that you will wrote me a book  so , i will try to be shorter ( i said try ) , not to conviece you , but just to present a french point of view ( witch mean that i am not fighting with you at all ) . 
  for the 1st point ( the south are lazy leachers ) , i do n't think normal ppl are lazy there . 
  i think they have been fucked up by their politics and it 's hard for me to see that the population has been punished but not the politics that has cheat them , even if i do agree that , at the end , every one have to pay their dept. 
  thus , for all of the ww2 stories , i think france had already accept a lot in forgiveness to germany ( and our peacefull relation is something i cherish ) . 
  as i told you else where , we do n't have anymore hate for you , just missunderstanding . 
  as you said , nowodayd german ppls are the more affected with ww2 . 
  the point is that french ppls are more affected with vichy gov action in ww2 than with our craps in our colonial empire , but we know we done craps . 
  so , that 's one of the reasons why french ppls supported hugely french war in mali to support the population their . 
  we have humanity dept to them so we are ready to die for them ( and i mean the ppls , not their corrupted gov ) . 
  then , i come back to the $ crisis . 
  we hate their corrupted government but we do n't think that normal ppls have to be only ones to pay the price of being refounded by us ( if french had to vote in a referendum that weither or not former greek president have to be beheaded , french will vote 90 % yes ! ) . 
  in an other hand , i find stupid to ask 2ww nazi historical dept to support any country fully refounding . 
  then , about your bad press ... let say that the uk one is worst but we are used to it . 
  they predict the fall of france as far as i remember and probably since a millenium and a half . 
  we are still alive so what uk press says of us ... 
  i just do n't know what bad thing we done to germany to deserve it ? 
  i mean , we accpted to do n't humiliate you after ww2 , to support your export trade to be sure that you will not be weak compare to rda , that you can reunite us , uk , fr germany , that you can reunite with est germany and became the strongest eu power . 
  so why your press just like to be bad with us ? 
  anyway , i just hope that you understand that i present the french point of view and that i m not attacking you or germans in general . 
  i know you like to use `` grande nation '' in an ironique way ... also , about the surrender story , ithink i red that hitler said : `` i always said that french are our worst and most dangerous ennemy . 
  if only a hundred of their general start to take their rifle and fight instead of throw it away and surrend , they may defeat us . '', 
  after the first nazi defeat at bir hakeim . 
  so my question is , does this stereotype came from ww2 our more from the 1870 's war ? 
  we do n't have hate anymore against germany or even a `` you pick me , i pick you '' game as we have with the uk . 
  our only trouble is that we do n't understand why you chose to punish the poeple of south europe instead of take care of them . 
  in a french point of view , it was a unique opportunity to wash all of the past century deaths link with germany and a way to be seen as the european hero for a century . 
  french are dreaming for such an opportunity . 
  oh , i use to be surprise about how german poeples are pretty calm when you discuss with them ( real life or internet ) about france , compare to how your press never says a good thing about us . 
   uk is the country we love to hate and also the one we hate to love ( cause how ever our disagrements , you are probably our best friend ) . 
   nato 's response is no way that quick . 
  that 's mainly why france use to prefer to act out of nato command . 
  so for france , eu invasion = france invasion = sink the boats . 
  also , i 'm not a big supporter of these sell ( we should had never sign this contract ) and i never believe putin ( note that putin can be read as whore ) . 
  but , first no one here seems to be shocked by all eu military sells to russia since 2008 ( and those 2 boats are one of them ) . 
  second , poland will never lead france to change advice by pretending they will buy something to them . 
  finally , it makes us in the position of the falklands war . 
  we had provided every exocet weakness to england and used the french maintenance guys in the argentina navy to provide intelligence to the uk . 
  thus , i dislike the argument here said that france betrave the eu solidarity since i still wait for any poland eu solidarity ( we still feel pretty alone in mali ) and it 's not like they is already some french air force in the baltic ( and french air force is pretty aware about how to sink french boats ) while by the time we are still ready to bomb assad or maybe iran ( ukraine is not our single source of trouble with russia ) . 
   i think french do n't understand that even those 2 small ships are actually a existential threat to baltics for instance . 
  like someone already noted , these ships make possible to invade georgia in few hours instead of days - its not a trivial so those ships will be sinks in a couple of hours if they are used to invade europe . 
  thanks . 
  as i had focus my critics on eu countries , let 's now also add canada and australia . 
  they had ( in my opinion ) been engage in risky missions and paid the hard price for their engagement . 
  i also think that poland is ready to go but they have to deal with russia . 
  if spain might be understood because they add terrorist attacks in madrid ( but as uk had in london ) , i see the others eu nato members focusing their effort to find excuses to not do anything ( and accept some little missions when they do not have any choice ) . 
   but really just have the americans do most everything ? 
  i do agree that most eu countries only wait fot the us to do the dirty job . 
  but i still think france do its part and feel like `` why us-uk-france always have to do the dirty job ? '',
