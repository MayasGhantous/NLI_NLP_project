  maybe some major figures will leave the party if they disagree with the final choice made ... as i said , we do n't know much yet , but if what i heard is indeed true it could potentially be interesting and have repercussions on the upcoming presidential race . 
  at the moment there is very little information . 
  could be true , could be false . 
  this made me think of an extremely similar thing that happenened in france , under sarkozy . 
  turned out it was false : the secret services made up a whole case against left-wing militants who had done absolutely nothing wrong but had been closely spied on for months , because politicians were persuaded they were dangerous terrorists . 
  the evidence were forged , the guys had done nothing wrong . 
   ` rule 68 ' was abolished - primary schools are no longer required to devote 30 minutes per day to religious education . 
  very significant indeed , i 'm glad to hear it . 
  ( i very rarely hear about ireland in mainstream french medias . 
  is it the same in the rest of europe ? 
  so thanks for writing this here . ), 
   storm gertrude fucked shit up - the ` dark hedges ' , famously used in game of thrones , were damaged i do n't watch got so i had to google : what a pity , the trees must have been centuries old and it was beautiful : /, 
   renzi ( pm ) pissed off junker and vice versa about what ? 
  i saw images and i 'm not buying there were 300,000 people either . 
  it seemed like it was way way less than that ( but it 's always difficult to judge and i 'm not familiar with the location ) . 
  ** france ** : - main thing this week : ** minister of justice , christiane taubira , resigns ** . 
  rumors about/calls for her departure have been pretty consistent for years , but this announcement still came as a surprise . 
  there was a thread here this week , but if you have n't seen it : * why is she leaving ( now ) ? 
  * she 's much more left-wing than the rest of the government and the reform of the constitution , soon to be presented before the parliament , was the last straw for her . 
  this constitutional reform will include - the deprivation of nationality for people ( with dual citizenship ... it 's complicated , it keeps changing ) guilty of terrorist crimes ( and offenses now ) - & the inscription of the state of emergency in the constitution . 
  taubira has always been against this deprivation of citizenship `` idea '' , like every left-wing politician : many changed their minds since the november attacks , not her . 
  ( other left-wing figures have previouslyy left the government or were sacked for thinking `` outside the box '' , but she is the most charismatic , she really became a symbol ) . 
  * why is she so important ? 
  * she 's a woman , she 's black , she passed the most important law of hollande 's presidency : gay marriage . 
  she 's always been the right and far-right 's favourite target . 
  ( the `` thanks obama ! '', 
  meme ha ~ ~ s ~ ~ d an equivalent in france : `` taubira resign ! '', 
  like every left-wing justice minister , she 's been accused of laxity , of `` emptying prisons '' , of every thing that 's wrong in the country ... except it was even more aggressive than before . 
  she received racist and sexist insults , especially during the months of protests against gay marriage . 
  but even before she was appointed minister of justice by hollande , she was despised by the right , because she also passed a law recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity ( for the right this means france is forced to repentance and it 's so mean !, 
  / s ) and she started her political career in guyana , as an independentist militant ) . 
  * who was appointed to replace her ? 
  * jean-jacques urvoas , specialist of security matters and manuel valls friendly . 
  it 's like we have 3 interior ministers now : the one who really is the current interior minister ( bernard cazeneuve ) , our prime minister ( manuel valls ) who was interior minister until 2 years ago and who very much acts like sarkozy , as a `` mister security '' , and now our new justice minister ( jj urvoas ) , who recently said he wanted to merge interior and justice ( yay to separation of powers ! ), 
  - ** a labour code reform is on its way : the 35 hours/week rule will `` remain '' , but it will be `` slightly '' changed , you know for the good of the employees , who need to be more competitive . 
  ** yes , our government is socialist , why do you ask ? 
  / s the minister of economy , emmanuel macron , is very much in favour of the liberalisation of the economy ( no , he 's not even a member of the socialist party , he comes from the banking world , he 's right-wing ) . 
  he 's been pleading for reforms in order to please the big companies , but thank you mister hollande , thank you mister valls , the 35 hours rule will not be amended ... employees will `` only '' see their 30 % bonus for extra hours changed to 10 % . 
  only if they agree , of course . 
  it 's a social progress because ... oh shit i forgot ... why is it a social progress for french workers again ? 
  oh yes that 's right : companies will be able to hire more people , which will reduce unemployement !, 
  ( we 'll see if that works ... ) ( and no , french people do not actually only work 35 hours per week : they work more than that , but they are paid ~ ~ 30 % ~ ~ now 10 % more for these extra hours . 
  we 'll see if they agree to work as much for less money ... ) - ** protests of : farmers , taxi drivers and civil servants this week ** . 
  the ones we heard about the most were the taxi drivers : still protesting against uber for its unfair competition . 
  taxi drivers burned tires which was said to be a very violent and intolerable way of protesting . 
  the government promised the same things they promised last year . 
  we 'll see if things change and if uber agrees to pay its taxes ... 
  farmers also protested , which happens every two months or so : against the low price the big supermarkets offer them . 
  they say 6/10 farms would close without the european subventions . 
  civil servants ( teachers and medical staff ) protested for various reasons , including their wages . 
  - ** people protested all around the country yesterday against the state of emergency . 
  but the turnout was modest ** . 
  they do n't want this `` state of emergency '' to become perpetual . 
  terrorism will remain strong in europe for at least the next decade and giving up our principles and our freedom is exactly what the terrorists wanted . 
  - ** hollande signed $ $ $ contracts with india and iran . 
  ** airbus contracts mostly . 
  - ** the zika virus which is spreading fast in south america is affecting french overseas department ** . 
  pregnant women are advised not to travel to martinique , guadeloupe or guyana ... and to postpone their pregnancy for those who live there . 
  - ** jacques rivette , film director at the center of the french new wave , died . 
  ** - ** jacqueline sauvage 's daughters and lawyers had a meeting with fran\u00e7ois hollande , in order to plead for a presidential pardon . 
  ** this 66 year-old woman killed her husband in 2012 . 
  they were married for 47 years , 47 years during which he beat and raped her . 
  he also raped their children . 
  the day following the suicide of her son , she shot him in the back , while he was drinking . 
  since this was not self-defense , she was sentenced to 10 years in jail . 
  everyone in the town where jacqueline sauvage and her family lived knew her husband was rude and violent and suspected awful things were probably going on inside the house , but no one said a thing . 
  neighbors did file complains because he had threatened them , but the mayor did n't actually do anything for jacqueline sauvage and her 3 kids . 
  the doctors who saw her bruises did n't alert the authorithies either . 
  the family who strongly suspected inappropriate behaviours remained silent too . 
  an online petition to ask for a presidential pardon reached 430,000 signatures . 
  ( she would still be guilty of the crime she committed but her sentence would be reduced or called off ) . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande has not yet made his decision , he 's thinking about it . 
  he 's said in the past ( like many politicians before they are in power ) that he 's against the indea of pardons , but he already pardoned a man ( who was the oldest french inmate ) . 
  - ** a 16 year-old teen was killed in marseille . 
  ** reasons unknown yet afaik . 
  could be drug gang related . 
  - ** a man was arrested for carrying weapons in disneyland paris ** . 
  the police concluded it was not a terrorist plan : the guy bought the weapons to defend himself in his bar and he brought them with him to disneyland `` because he did n't know who to give them to during his stay there '' . 
  he will be charged for illegal carrying of weapons . 
  - ** a huge cargo ship is drifting off the french coast . 
  operations to tow it to shore are under way , but difficult because of the weather conditions . 
  ** inside there 's wood but also lots of petrol . 
  ( apologies for the wall of text ), 
  i think it was like , a month ago , when i heard that this scenario could likely happen and that podemos had announced what their conditions are in order to work with the psoe . 
  so what happened since then ? 
  have their list of conditions changed ? 
  ( i think i heard they had 10 bullet points ) . 
  is psoe refusing to cooperate ? 
  are negociations completely secret ? 
  what do militants from both parties think about it ? 
  ( are podemos electors scared about a greek scenario , where pablo iglesias is forced to revisit his conditions ? ), 
  what happens if one or the other eventually completely refuses to make concessions ? 
  ** france ** - ** the state of emergency , which was supposed to end in a month , will be extended . 
  ** the state of emergency - enacted by fran\u00e7ois hollande immediately after the november attacks - was supposed to last 3 months . 
  the government just announced ( and we are not surprised ) it will be extended , for 3 months , until the 26th of may . 
  there is no debate about this . 
  over at / r/france everybody is against it . 
  parties on the left of the socialist party are against it . 
  a few voices on the right also express doubts . 
  the league of human rights is against it .
