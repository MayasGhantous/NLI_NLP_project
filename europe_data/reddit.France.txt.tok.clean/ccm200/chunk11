  but it will pass because politically they ca n't afford ending it and having another terrorist attack happening in the hours/days/weeks / months following . 
  journalists do n't really dispute it , there is no debate . 
  it 's frightening . 
  ( also , after may , there is a major event occuring in france : the football euro cup . 
  will they extend the state of emergency for a third time because of it ? 
  ... too soon to say but we would n't be surprised . ), 
  many cases of people accused of being terrorists without evidence exist . 
  this week one man 's case was finally cleared ( and he will receive 1500 euros ) but overall , as i said it 's not widely discussed . 
  did i mention it 's scary and sad and pisses me off ? 
  - ** hollande announced a 2 billion plan to fight unemployment . 
  ** as soon as he got elected in 2012 , hollande promised that he would not be ( able to ? ), 
  candidate for a second mandate if the unemployment figures did n't decrease . 
  this is his last year to improve things so he 's gon na give 2000 euros to companies for each job created , and he also wants to put as many unemployed people in training as possible ( they will disappear from the unemployment statistics ) . 
  - ** sarkozy wrote a book , entitled `` france for life '' , in which he supposedly acknowledges past mistakes . 
  ** except apparently the dozen of mistakes he agrees to recognize are minor ones . 
  the most important point of this book is that he changed his mind about gay marriage : a few months ago he promised his fans he would repeal the law if he was reelect . 
  well in the book he explains that actually , no . 
  ( another right wing politician from sarkozy 's party - jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 - published a similar book this week ) . 
  people are mocking them , in their majority : most french people are aware this is not sincere . 
  - ** it has been found that 12 billion euros were hidden by french nationals in swiss accounts . 
  ** ( 38,000 accounts ) surprising ... - ** 5 soldiers died in an avalanche last weekend ** . 
  ( apparently they were experienced , trained for exactly this exercise , but they were stupid enough to go in together 50 at a time , which is the best way to launch an avalanche . ), 
  - ** there was a protest in calais yesterday , in support of migrants . 
  some people managed to board a ferry , before being evacuated , of course . 
  ** brits reading : this is at least as much your problem as ours ( i say this because we are used to reading french bashing articles about this issue in your newspapers and i 'm anticipating the circle-jerk : no need , we heard you already . 
  have something to suggest ? 
  that 's what i thought ) . 
  - ** feminists protested yesterday , in support of a woman sentenced to 10 years for having killed her husband ... who beat and sexually assaulted her and their kids for 47 years . 
  ** they are asking for a presidential grace . 
  ( she killed her husband the day after her son committed suicide , he too was a victim of the dad ) . 
  - ** edmonde charles roux - resistant and writer - and michel tournier , writer both died this week . 
  ** france ** : - ** a 15 year-old teen attempted to murder a jewish teacher ** ( who was wearing a kippah ) in the name of isis . 
  a local jewish leader advised his community to remove their kippah and hide a little for a while , until things gets better ( not verbatim , i 'm paraphrasing ) . 
  other rabbis strongly disagreed with him and ** politicians vocally condemned antisemitism and encouraged french jews to live their lives freely . 
  ** the teen was totally unknown from the police and inteligence services . 
  his parents say they saw absolutely nothing . 
  he even was a good student : witnesses of the attack found copies that fell from his backpack , with excellent grades . 
  he apparently decided to join isis very recently , after watching propaganda videos online . 
  he said he regrets ~ ~ nothing ~ ~ not killing the teacher . 
  - ** the last ( ? ), 
  of the november attacks kamikazes was finally identified ** . 
  he was from moleenbeck , like many of the others . 
  - ** 1 man is brain dead , 4 others hospitalized with potentially very serious neurological damages , after a drug test `` fail '' ** . 
  and a 5th man is in hospital because he received the same drug ( same amount ) , but he does n't have any symptom ( yet ? ), 
  - ** 2 french teens were killed in an avalanche ** ( an ukrainian tourist died too ) . 
  they were on a school trip with a group of about 10 students . 
  the ski slope was not open , there were signs all over the place to warn people it was not allowed to ski there . 
  their teacher ( who is treated at the hospital ) got treated in a psychiatric clinic recently , for depression . 
  journalists focused heavily on that . 
  ------------------------------------------------- other stuff but i 'm too lazy to type . 
  ( sorry for the grammar mistakes and the very lazy post this week btw ) . 
  ------------------------------------------------------- but we mostly talked about : david bowie , the cologne investigation ( & other cities affected by similar events ) , the istambul attack , jakarta attack & ouagadougou attack . 
  as well as c\u00e9line dion 's husband 's death . 
  and the powerball lottery in the us , cause of course we give a shit and this is important news . 
  i heard a doctor say it was discovered only 8 years ago and scientists barely know how it works . 
  ( also if i remember well , he said that a similar drug which had been commercialized a few years ago was quickly removed from the market because it created huge side effects : suicides !, 
  not 100 % sure about that : i was watching the news channel were experts were continually interviewed and said a lot of stuff , but i 'm pretty sure that 's what he said . ), 
  the research on this `` cannabinoid system '' is very new and he was saying a new painkiller drug was absolutely not necessary , we already have a good enough range of drugs for that , which have proven to be effective . 
  well i watched the press conference ( which happened shortly after these comments ) and the health minister clearly said it was absolutely not cannabis based . 
  she explained the molecule affects the '' '' `` cannabino\u00efd receptors '' '' '' ( `` le syst\u00e8me endocannabino\u00efde '' , do n't know how it 's called in english ) . 
  journalists who are not scientific experts probably misinterpretated the initial informations they got . 
  edit : removed the double negation which made it sound the opposite of what i meant . 
  you called yourself that ... 
   we clearly can not save everyone why ? 
   the attempt puts us in danger why ? 
  * they * did ? 
  they did n't but we 're selfish and they would react the same way if that was us , but we probably wo n't verify this cause we live in safer , stabler countries ... ( relevant username ), 
  so you would let all the men die in syria ? 
  in terms of efficiency , if we are looking at this purely from a pragmatic point of view : - it obviously wo n't make potential terrorists change their minds and cancel an attack they had planned , or rethink their decision to join isis . 
  on the contrary , they would see this as a kind of throphy . 
  - so a jihadist convicted for terrorism will be sentenced to say 30 , 40 years in jail and after he has served his sentence in france , he will supposedly be sent to his country of origin , cause we do n't consider him french and do n't want him here . 
  but a lot of these countries obviously wo n't agree with that , they will refuse . 
  you may think france is right , but they are also entitled to have their say . 
  it is a form of neo-colonialist approach which wo n't be very wise , diplomatically . 
  so what is going to happen ? 
  this might well lead to the creation of new camps in a few decades , like guantanamo . 
  if they do agree or are eventually forced to take them , in a lot of unstable countries it would only create more danger and chaos . 
  now the most important arguments : - this totally changes the historic conception of nationality in france : the constitution states that all citizens are equal , no matter how they acquired their citizenship . 
  now it would mean that those who inherited their french nationality from their parents , from blood , are treated differently than those who received it because they were born in france . 
  this is simply a huge shift in the core values of the french republic , which will principally affect a very very small number of people but will change the way millions of innocent french citizens are considered . 
  this is what isis wants , create division and see actual state discrimination implemeted . 
  many people principally oppose to the fact that this is enshrined in the constitution , i.e they would not object that much to a simple law ( they do kinda agree with the sentiment ) , but they are against the fact that it becomes a part of the constitution . 
  ( what happened is that 2 days after the november attacks , politically hollande was forced to react in a big way . 
  he summoned the congress in versailles and made an important speech . 
  obviously this time , the right and far-right were more critical than in january and called for more drastic measures , including this deprivation of citizenship . 
  so hollande announced that this would be on the table , but he actually thought that the constitutional council would judge this unconstitutional . 
  hollande would have been able to say `` i heard you , i accepted to consider this proposition , but see : we ca n't do that '' . 
  in fact the constitutional council decision was to say `` indeed this poses serious questions , blablabla but it 's up to the parliament to decide '' . 
  this will be debated in a few weeks and it looks like it 's going to pass , easily . ), 
  - this is a way of denying the fact that `` terrorism is ( also ) french '' . 
  a way of pretending that it comes from abroad and refusing to see that french citizens who grew up in france became terrorists . 
  symbollically it 's not just a minor aspect of it all . 
  - quite a lot of politicians on the right are already asking for this measure to apply not only to terrorism but also to other crimes ( for instance people who kill cops ) . 
  where do we put the limit , how are we sure it will really stop there , once it 's added to the constitution ? 
  what if marine le pen gets elected , or even sarkozy re-elected ? 
  we all know each time a big drama happens , leaders are forced to react and they tend to create new laws . 
  if a new attack occurs in 2017 and le pen , sarkozy or someone else is president , they will do like hollande : add yet a new big big law . 
  this is scary . 
  this measure has historically been supported by the far-right , and recently by the right , yet a supposedly socialist president is going to be the one to enforce it , although he and all his government combatted it in the recent past , using the same arguments i 'm listing : it 's hard not to imagine that the death penalty for instance could easily come back in a few months or years , if the right is governing and there 's a new attack . 
  thanks for taking the time to write such a detailed reply !,
