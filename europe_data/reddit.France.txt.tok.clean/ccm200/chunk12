  case a : ouch , i assumed it just created lots of articles and discussions on the 1st of january , when journalists usually do n't have many stuff to report and like to mention small but original events . 
  but i see it 's far more serious , poor guy  case b :  double the revenue of the force awakens in 9 days it sounds like a very unusual phenomenon . 
  i mean , one movie makes it really really big perhaps every 2 or 3 years but to surpass star wars !, 
  especially right now when several big american blockbusters are screening !, 
  people love cheesy films , that 's what it sounds like . 
  there have been lots of action and sci-fi movies recently , quite violent and/or grim : a nice simple romance is good too , 
  to expand on what has already been written above : - ** this has been a week of commemorations of the attacks of last year ** , with several ceremonies held in memory of the charlie hebdo team , the jews killed in the casher supermarket and of the policemen and policewoman shot as well . 
  ** today ( sunday ) there will be another , big , hommage place de la r\u00e9publique ** , with a tree being planted there and famous singer johnny halliday singing a song written about the events . 
  ( there 's a small controversy since this singer was really not charlie hebdo 's cartoonists ' cup of tea and also he 's really goofy and not the best at talking live in such circumstances . 
  and also the army choir will perform which again , when knowing that they were very antimiliratistic is `` funny '' ... 
  but i heard there should be a jacques brel song as well , maybe i 'm wrong , i do n't know who would sing it . 
  we are sure to cry if that 's the case . ), 
  - sad week indeed since ** several talented and beloved people passed away ** : singer michel delpech , actor michel galabru , composer pierre boulez and fashion designer andr\u00e9 courr\u00e8ges . 
  plus it was also fran\u00e7ois mitterand 's death anniversary . 
  and another famous singer 's , daniel balavoine . 
  basically this week has been like all saints day/halloween , 
   well , a distracted tv techincian aired a porco dio on new year 's eve . 
  i had to google but i 'm still not sure : a technician was heard saying this and it 's considered offensive mostly by , i assume , conservatives and old people ? 
  what was the context ? 
  somewhat related : in france , on the main tv channel ( tf1 ) during the saturday morning teleshopping show , an image showing the logo of the party les r\u00e9publicains ( sarkozy 's ) was broadcasted during a couple seconds . 
   - quo vado ? , an italian movie got double the revenue of the force awakens in 9 days . 
  wow !, 
  that 's very very very impressive !, 
  ca n't tell if you liked the film or not , based on your summary . 
  maybe you have n't seen it yet ? 
   it all sounds like it 's the most important thing in the world , when it 's a reform that wo n't change anything ... 
  it 's not just `` a reform '' : it 's a constitutional reform !, 
   to me , this is all really symptomatic of france , people arguing about ideological concepts forever ... well for me , it 's a good thing : we all said `` france was attacked , its identity , its values inherited from the enlightenment were threatened by terrorists , etc. . . '' but in practice we used mottos like `` je suis charlie '' and other symbolic phrases and that 's pretty much it . 
  with this debate , we can see an actual manifestation of france 's love for debate , intellectual arguments , democracy !, 
  terrorists do n't care about losing their french identity , but they would love to see us forget about how our country runs and accept new exception laws without protesting , after each attack . 
  ( of course this is not only a french thing , not what i 'm saying . 
  and of course the quality of the debate has been very very disappointing , but i really do want to stress that it 's actually a positive thing for me , even though - being against this reform which will very probably pass - i 'm sadenned by all this , intellectually and politically ) . 
   nothing else really happened , other than our country slowly but surely becoming a police state . 
  there are two articles in the constitutional reform : one about this deprivation of nationality thing and the other about enshrining the state of emergency in the constitution . 
  which we do n't need either , since the state of emergency was declared by hollande the night of the 13th of november without needing it to be written in the constitution . 
  it will probably be very dangerous and lead us more towards a police state , giving more powers to the executive to the detriment of the judiciary control . 
   they chanted `` arabs get out !, 
  '' , `` this is our home ! '', 
  ** and [ `` we must kill them !, 
  '' ] ( https://twitter.com/nasnacera/status/680542612995092480 ) ** ( btw i have n't seen these images on tv , yet . 
  same for all fellow frenchies ? ), 
  i do n't want to . 
  once again why am i even wasting my time on this subreddit , you guys are n't even gon na read me ( really read ) but , nevermind , i 'm entitled to comment too , so here goes : many french users already commented to explain what the case was really about and to provide better translations than what you based your judgments on ( * ) . 
  nevertheless you just do n't want to listen and in a thread about prejudices , hate speech etc you all ... blame the muslims , the immigrants , and use quotation marks because this french rapper is called sa\u00efd . 
  but nothing hypocritical here , as usual !, 
  your reactions totally fit and you do n't even realise !, 
  and mods ca n't delete everything , of course , but you would like to censor this song ... ( * maybe they did n't stress enough what this association is : `` agrif , alliance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale contre le racisme et pour le respect de l'identit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise et chr\u00e9tienne '' = `` general alliance against racism ** and for the respect of the french and christian identity ** '' , meaning that the french identity is christian , except not : france has no religion , it 's a secular state , its citizens are equal no matter their skin color , origin , religion ... that 's the whole point here ! ), 
  the lyrics are on-point , but you need to be able to read them : which requires minimal knowledge about the politics in france . 
  so do n't pretend you know more than this rapper : what he wrote is simply , true . 
  i do n't feel insulted , as a white french citizen . 
  but so many of you , who are n't even french aree : ask yourselves why : that 's what he asks in his song . 
  but you ca n't hear . 
  i think you 're behind * slightly * paranoid here . 
  if you thought op was implying hollande or france or any other attacked country is to be blamed , based on his question . 
  maybe it was just a question ? 
  the way i read it , he/she is asking why france did n't bomb more . 
  oh and merah had no link with daesh . 
  ... who are you replying to ? 
  that 's not what op asked and i see no one commenting something that could inspire this response . 
   the uk pegida leader has resigned after an embarrassing interview meanwhile in france , marine le pen says - during a speech for her campaign in the regional elections - that `` islamist totalitarism will take over power in our country , if we lose the war against it . 
  if we lose , the islamic veil will be imposed to all women , sharia will replace our constitution and barbarity will be installed . '', 
  which is not very different from what this pegida guy said , but she did n't stutter and seemed convinced . 
  she 's a better orator , that 's the difference . 
  ** france ** ** politics ** - ** today is the first round of the regional elections . 
  the national front is leading in the polls ** ( for the first round : things will be different during the second round , next sunday ) . 
  ( see [ projections for this first round ] ( https://i.imgur.com/t3sw9sd.jpg ) ) . 
  we are voting to elect our representatives in each of the new 13 regions . 
  ( there used to be 22 regions ) . 
  their mandate will last for 6 years . 
  regions control ( parts of ) the public school systems , higher education , professional training programmes and public transport , as well as aspects of culture , sports , tourism and regional languages . 
  and , this is new , they now also are responsible for supporting their local small - and medium-sized businesses . 
  how does it work ? 
  it is based on proportional representation : in the first round of voting ( today ) , the party that receives an absolute majority of votes automatically gets a quarter of the available seats . 
  the remaining seats are allocated proportionally among the parties that receives at least 5 % of the vote . 
  if no party receives an absolute majority in the first round ( today ) , a second round of voting occurs ( next sunday ) . 
  only the parties that garnered at least 10 % of the vote in the first round are allowed to participate in the second . 
  ( the candidates for each party can change in the period between voting rounds . 
  for example , two parties that both received at least 5 % in the first-round vote can join forces to create a new candidate list for the second round . 
  which always creates discussions about what the best strategy is to counter the national front : which party should give up its list and allow the other `` republican '' party to win , so that the national front does n't come first ? ), 
  it is supposed to be a local election , but - as is always the case - with the media 's help , the campaign has been centered on national issues . 
  before the attacks of last month and after . 
  the regions with a big national front candidate have been covered way more than the others : especially the nord-pas-de-calais-picardie region , where marine le pen is candidate ( although she will be campaigning for the presidentials next year ) and the provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d\u2019azur , where her niece marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen is candidate . 
  ( and as per usual , journalists always focus heavily on the paris region , \u00cele de france ) . 
  other regions have been largely left out in the media . 
  - ** hollande 's popularity jumped in a month 's time , reaching 50 % of approval ** , his highest level since 2012 ( right after his election ) . 
  this is a `` historic '' gain ( +22 % ) : until then hollande 's popularity ratings were `` historically '' low . 
  - ** paris is hosting the cop 21 ** . 
  lots of media coverage , but now that heads of state have left and negatiotors are working , we are basically waiting until we know more . 
  a preliminary draft has been agreed on ... there 's a week before the big conclusion . 
  - ** germany and the uk are joining the coalition agaisnt isis ** . 
  honestly it seems to me that the french do n't really care about these decisions ... - ** state of emergency raises questions ** : as lots of people got searched , without being given any explanation , and ecologist activists placed under house arrest . 
  [ website lists data ( in french ) ] ( https://wiki.laquadrature.net/%c3%89tat_urgence/recensement ) . 
  [ le monde has a blog about all these decisions ( in french ) ] ( http://delinquance.blog.lemonde.fr/ ) . 
  last entry is about a group of 5 to 8 young people who were walking in the streets of the posh 4rth arroundissement of paris and were stopped quite violently by around 40 policemen . 
  their crime ? 
  playing the harmonica and the tambourine , while walking next to a bicycle bearing a white flag with an ecologist acronym . 
  lots of similar examples . 
  it 's scary . 
  ** other news ** - ** valbuena 's sex tape case : karim benzema 's interview with the judge was published in le monde newspaper ** . 
  i do n't care !,
