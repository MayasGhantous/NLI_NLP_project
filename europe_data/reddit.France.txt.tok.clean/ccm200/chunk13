  stop talking about this so much !!!, 
  football fans are interested because benzema 's and valbuena 's participation to the euro cup in a few months will depend on the verdict . 
  - ** famous businessman bernard tapie ordered to repay more than 400 million euros ( yes , 400 millions ! ), 
  to the state . 
  ** in a complex case i wo n't bother to explain here . 
  it 's very hard to explain , but it ( obvioulsy ) has political aspects ( christine lagarde , current imf president , has always been spared but she 's at the center of this since she was minister of the economy at the time . 
  nicolas sarkozy was also in power at the time ) . 
  - ** this weekend is the annual t\u00e9lethon : a fundraising event to help disabled children primarily . 
   we celebrated guy fawkes night , although a few edgy people forgot what the nights supposed to be about let me guess : guy fawkes night is about watching fireworks and cheering ? 
  ( if french people were to protest on the 14th of july , would you say they are edgy and forgot it is a day to celebrate our military ? ), 
  ** france ** : not much . 
  the sinai plane crash was what made the news throughout the week . 
  - ** air cocaine : the 2 pilots who fled from the dominican republic have been placed under custody in france . 
  ** they have been interrogated by the judge . 
  since it 's a complicated affair i guess it will take a while before we learn more . 
  - ** karim benzema is suspected in the valbuena sex-tape blackmail case ** . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34720075 ) 's an article in english . 
  tl ; dr : too soon to jump to conclusions , but benzema does have suspicious childhood friends . 
  - ** the most important literary prizes have been awarded this week ** . 
  the most famous one , the goncourt prize , went to mathias enard 's * boussole * . 
  - ** one of the most famous criminal affairs in france 's history may be solved thanks to new dna analysis : omar raddad , who was convicted and then pardoned but never innocented , may be cleared . 
  ** in short : in 1991 a woman was murdered and her arab gardener was accused , because the sentence `` omar m ' a tuer '' ( `` omar killed me '' ) was written next to her body . 
  written with the victim 's blood . 
  but 1 ) it was mispelled and the lady was n't the type of person to make grammatical mistakes , even when about to die ; 2 ) given the angles of the body and of the sentence on the wall , it 's really not clear that the victim could have written it ; 3 ) omar raddad did n't have any motive ( other than he was poor and she was rich ) ; 4 ) many other elements which i do n't remember now . 
  dna fingerprints that were stained with the victim 's blood and do not belong to raddad will finally be compared to the national database of convicted criminals with hopes to find a new suspect . 
  even if raddad was pardoned by chirac , his life was completely destroyed . 
  ( i heard a lot of journalists say that it could be some policeman 's fingerprints , but raddad 's lawyer say these traces have been found in many places , mingled with the victim 's blood ) . 
  ah , the french government also used a similar `` instrument '' ( article 49,3 ) twice in the last few months . 
  `` to be quicker '' . 
  ** france ** : - ** air coca\u00efne : two french pilots convicted of cocaine trafficking in dominican republic ... 
  ** crazy story . 
  so let me recap , it 's like a james bond movie : in march 2013 , at an airport in the dominican republic , 4 men were arrested right before their take off to france on a private falcon 50 jet . 
  onboard , there were 26 suitcases filled with 700 kg of cocaine . 
  the four men were french : two pilots and two passengers . 
  in august 2015 , after 15 months in custody they were sentenced to 20 years in prison . 
  then they were released under judicial supervision pending an appeals court hearing and so they were free to move around but not leave the country , of course . 
  this week we learn that `` hello , we 've come back home , we 're here , in france . 
  let us rest for a week and then we will come see a french judge . 
  we do n't trust the dominican justice system so we would rather be tried here '' . 
  ( i 'm paraphrasing but they actually had an even worse attitude when they appeared in front of the cameras ) . 
  they refused to explain how their escape took place , but we learned that they were helped by former french naval officers and intelligence agents ( friends they made when they were in the army ) and also by ... a front national member of parliament !, 
  they ` simply ' fled on a boat and reached the french island of saint-martin , where they received valid passports and took a plane to france . 
  the two other french men , the passengers , are still in the dominican republic and of course , they are afraid of repercussions in the way the appeal is handled by the dominicans . 
  and , to make things even more bizarre , one of these two had an accident a few days ago and could need to have his leg amputated : his lawyer says his health is at stake . 
  ( he was hit by a motorcycle ... 
  weird ! ), 
  the french government reacted by stating that it had nothing to do with the escape , it was `` personal initiatives '' . 
  ( which is certainly true : the former agents involved were retired but had kept certain connections ) . 
  it 's going to be a very complicated case to handle diplomatically . 
  the 4 french men claim they are innocent and also that they did n't have a fair trial at all : they say they have n't been interrogated and the evidence was forged . 
  the dominicans say they are part of an international drug smuggling network ( with links with the mafia operating in marseille i think i heard ) . 
  ( also sarkozy is somehow linked to all this : the company which chartered the private plane had in the past also be used by sarkozy ... and judges are curious to know why he did n't pay the bill , but a friend of his did . 
  no link to the drug affair , but haha , he always ends up in all the big judicial cases . 
  is n't he a perfect candidate for the next presidential election ? ), 
  - ** a far-right lawyer shot and seriously wounded a bar chairman , then shot himself , in the courthouse ** . 
  a [ source in english ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/general/20151029-drama-french-court-house-lawyer-shoots-bar-chairman-kills-himself ) but that 's basically all we know for now . 
  - ** puisseguin coach crash : 43 dead ** . 
  mostly pensioners but also a 3 year-old boy ( the trunk driver 's son who was with his dad ) . 
  8 people survived , but 4 were severely injured/burned . 
  most of the victims were from the same little village . 
  - ** the french are cheaper than the germans : hurray we are competitive ** !, 
  unemployment is still high but repeat after me : `` we * are too expensive , we * need to be competitive '' . 
  ( * `` we '' = human beings , but maybe we need to change this word too ... would `` product '' work better ? ), 
  - ** airbus ' profits reached their highest record in the company 's history , but they still need to cut those thousands of jobs remember . 
  ** the man whose pretty shirt was ripped off by savage non-competitive ~ ~ products ~ ~ workers offered them a new deal : 3 new plans ... all involving making more efforts for less money . 
  is n't that so great ??? 
  rejoice people , all is good nowadays , capitalism is great !, 
  ( and btw , strangely the media were so nice to the poor ` heroes ' who escaped the justice of another country - `` was the trip difficult ? 
  you must be exhausted ? 
  were you scared ? '', 
  - they did n't treat them like they treated the ones who dared tear off a shirt ) . 
  - ** sarkozy visited putin ** . 
  and putin made him wait , it was funny . 
  ** france ** yes and : - ** air france : the 5 workers who ripped the shirts of two of their executives last week were placed under police custody . 
  ** there was a controversy about the method used : the police arrested them at 6am at home . 
  which is * slightly * disproportionate , given that they were not going anywhere . 
  this method of arrest is normally used when dealing with organized crime groups ... 
  they were kept in custody for more than 24 hours : i personally wonder why it took so long given that there was a video of the altercation . 
  many people said that this was done to `` make an example '' out of them , to humiliate them in front of their families . 
  they will be judged at the beginning of december . 
  the government ( once again ) changed its stance on the whole affair : while last week they stood firmly by the company , this week they had a few words for the employees who suffer from the job cuts and the lack of communication . 
  - ** 6 french djihadists killed during the air strikes against isis ? 
  ** our foreign politicy does n't seem clear either : in the morning the government announced that french citizens were amongst those killed by our air strikes ... a few hours later pm manuel valls seemed reluctant to talk about it , simplifying things by saying something along the lines of `` the nationalities of terrorists do n't matter '' . 
  well okay but there are important questions behind all this . 
  transparency would be good . 
  - ** the police went on strike . 
  ** they are basically angry about two things : - too much work , particularly since the terrorist attacks in january . 
  thousands of policemen are stationned in sensitive areas ( guarding monuments , religious buildings ... ) which leads to longer hours of work and less possibilities to go on leave ( due to the shortage of staff ) . 
  they say that in other countries these tasks are assigned to subcontractors ( private companies ) . 
  [ important to note that it was sarkozy who cut many jobs in their sectors and that hollande hired lots of policemen since then ] . 
  - judges are too lax : the police feel like they work for nothing basically , because they keep arresting the same criminals , whom the justice ministry does n't punish severely enough . 
  [ prisons are overcrowded and the more recent justice reforms aim at changing this , but of course some people disagree ] . 
  this strike was `` triggered '' by the fact that a criminal , who did n't return to prison after a leave , shot a policeman . 
  - ** amedy coulibaly ( the hyper cacher terrorist ) received instructions from syria by e-mails ** . 
  not sure why we are only learning this now : it 's a bit scary if it took them 9 months to investigate on this ... 
  i have n't paid close attention but apparently they found exchanges between coulibaly and someone ( writing from syria ? ), 
  who was instructing him ( nothing really specific actually ) . 
  they have n't been able to trace these e-mails ... what is the nsa doing then ?!!!, 
  are we collaborating with the us on this ? 
  if yes and that 's all we can come up with ... why are we all being spied on , argh ?
