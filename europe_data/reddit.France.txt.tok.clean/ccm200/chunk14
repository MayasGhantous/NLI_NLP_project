  - ** the socialist party is holding a referendum this weekend , asking people `` faced with the right and the far-right , do you support unity between the left and the ecologists in the next regional elections ? 
  '' ** ie : `` do you agree to force the small parties to join us , or do you want to let the national front win ? '', 
  people who `` agree with the values of the left and the greens '' are invited to vote either in some markets or online ( you can cheat and vote multiple times ) . 
  the results will be known tonight . 
  it will just prove devastating for their image ... 
  there is an alternative referendum . 
  their question is a bit different : `` faced with the right and the far-right , do you think the government should lead a left-wing policy ? '', 
  - ** end of the fiscal incentive to buy diesel ? 
  ** for many years now , france had a tax policy that advantaged diesel . 
  it seems that after the volkswagen scandal , and since the barrel is quite cheap nowadays , s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royal ( minister of the environment ) changed her mind and agreed to gradually modify this , so that both diesel and petrol are taxed the same way . 
  - ** a shocking video of a slaughterhouse surfaced , thanks to a wistleblower employee ** . 
  someone who works inside took hours of footage and gave them to an animal protection organization . 
  the images are awful , but it seems that this is not an exception at all . 
  - ** the puppy stolen from a homeless guy by some crazy `` animal protection group '' a few weeks ago went back to its owner . 
  ** maybe you heard about it a few days ago : a video showed a homeless guy being harassed by some crazy `` animals integrists '' who stole his puppy . 
  the story ends well . 
  - ** first-ever french person legally recognized as ` gender neutral ' ** someone who was born with both male and female attributes ( ie a `` rudimentary vagina '' , a `` micro-penis '' and no testicles ) and producing no sexual hormones obtained the right to write ` gender neutral '' on official forms ( until then the 64-year-old had been referred to as monsieur ) . 
  but the state prosecution appealed the ruling , saying it meant de facto that france recognised a `` third gender '' , which is not mentioned in any of its laws . 
  - ** djibril ciss\u00e9 and three other men were arrested on tuesday in a blackmail investigation that allegedly involves a sex tape featuring international midfielder mathieu valbuena ** . 
  ciss\u00e9 was released before the 3 others . 
  he apparently knew about the sex tape story , but did he take part in the blackmail ? 
  does the video exist ? 
  - ** how dangerous is it to wear a kippa in france ? 
  ** maybe you remember seeing a video of an israeli man walking through the streets of paris and its suburbs ? 
  it was a released online one month after the attacks in january and showed multiple insults and threats against this man wearing a kippa . 
  well a journalist did the same thing in several cities and got completely different reactions : no insults , no threats , no spitting , but mostly indifference and a few reassuring words . 
  he goes on to say that , of course , antisemitism is real and on the rise in france . 
  the rest of his report focuses on the various forms of antisemitism in the country and why many jews choose to move to israel . 
  - ** ongoing censorship in canal plus ? 
  ** canal plus is a french tv channel that was very successful in the 90s . 
  particularly because of its `` politically incorrect '' programs . 
  since then the quality decreased but it 's still famous for his satirical programs . 
  since millionaire vincent bollor\u00e9 became director of canalplus this summer , many people were let go . 
  after the famous muppet show `` les guignols '' was cancelled , `` le zapping '' is rumored to be next . 
  this short program is simple : it shows extracts from yesterday 's tv programs . 
  so you 'll have 20 seconds of a speech by marine le pen , followed by 30 seconds of some reality tv show echoing with her ideas , followed by a completely different program and so on . 
  it 's simple but effective in showing what makes the essence of today 's values on tv . 
  [ it is political : bollor\u00e9 is sarkozy 's friend ] . 
  ** france ** - ** two air france executives had their shirts ripped off after employees interrupted a meeting announcing a plan to cut thousands of jobs . 
  ** the picture made the news around the world , illustrating the way foreigners see french workers . 
  it was , of course , widely commented in france too . 
  but another video received less attention : that of an employee begging her direction to answer her questions during the meeting . 
  she was complaining about the fact that `` workers did make the efforts asked by the company 4 years ago , but now thousands more employees are going to be laid-off and they were informed on tv '' . 
  the executives were ignoring her during the 4 or 5 long minutes of her speech , only saying they `` are not allowed to comment '' . 
  which is apparently true - they legally could not discuss this - but it illustrates how air france employees feel completely neglected and defenseless . 
  - ** nadine morano ( `` les r\u00e9publicains '' politician and former minister under nicolas sarkozy ) sparked a big controversy after saying that france is a `` judaeo-christian country of the white race '' ** . 
  the party decided to remove her from their list for the regional elections in december . 
  during a tv interview last weekend , nadine morano made this comment . 
  it is not at all unusual of her . 
  she is seen by many french electors as a complete moron , even amongst the right-wing supporters . 
  since there already are many candidates for the right-wing primary taking place next year ( to decide who will be running for president in 2017 ) , she is taking a `` donald trump '' strategy . 
  it actually is a ` good move ' for her in the end , since she received a lot of exposure after this controversy . 
  sarkozy , who himself has taken a very tough line in the past months , decided to draw a line here , but there is no doubt that they will `` reunite '' in the next few months . 
  morano has been a faithful ally to him for years . 
  this also happened after a lot of articles were published this month , denouncing the omnipresence of demoralizing and alarmist conservative ` intellectuels '' in our media . 
  - ** 8 year-old boy kidnapped by his father 3 years ago found in unsanitary flat . 
  ** parents divoced 3 years ago , the mother had custody . 
  the father kidnapped his son and disappeared from the radars . 
  the father was found in the north east ( he 's originally from the south ) thanks to an ex-employer . 
  the boy has been kept almost completely isolated from the world , living in awful conditions . 
  he would spend his days watching tv and speaking in a low voice . 
  the kid `` does n't want to be reunited with his mom '' yet . 
  - ** vincent lambert case still not over ** . 
  this man who was severely injured in a crash 6 or 7 years ago is at the center of a `` fight '' between his wife and other family members , who want to let him die , and his parents , who want to keep him alive . 
  he 's basically already dead ( braindead ) but the conservative christian parents refuse to let him go . 
  all judiciary appeals have been attempted : he should be `` euthanized '' * but this week yet another legal decision was made , that decided to postpone his death again . 
  ( * the french law on `` euthanasia '' does n't allow ` real euthanasia '' , hence the '' '' ) . 
  - ** massive clean-up and questions about the causes of the severe floods of last weekend . 
  death toll : 20 killed . 
  ** it 's a phenomenon that happens every year in the region , but seems to be more and more dangerous , because of global warning and also because of massive urbanization in these regions proned to flooding . 
  - ** rugby : france is currently playing against ireland ** . 
  the last two did n't reach the mainstream media but were widely commented on / r/france : - ** a lawyer popular on twitter has been fined because of a tweet he made about poop . 
  ** this lawyer , who never revealed his true identity ( he is known as `` ma\u00eetre eolas '' ) , is famous on the internet because of excellent blog posts and of his twitter account . 
  his blog posts are very informative about his job . 
  his tweets , however , sometimes are a bit less ` insightful ' . 
  he made a post about a lobby/group of people who kinda twist the informations about judicial cases for their populist agenda . 
  the group was angry and drew a complaint . 
  ma\u00eetre eolas addressed this on twitter , basically saying he does n't care and would rather use their words to `` clean his poop '' ( or something like that ) . 
  #cacagate trended on twitter after the sentence was announced . 
  ma\u00eetre eolas decided to leave twitter . 
  - apparently an ** anarchist group found out they had been spied on by the secret services ** . 
  we do n't have a lot of details . 
  the equipment used ( that they discovered , hidden in a school facing the library where they would meet ) was very expensive . 
  they said they threw it in a river . 
  ( a few years ago , another left-wing group was spied on for months ... turned out they had done nothing wrong and the way the case was handled by the surveillance services was very questionable ) . 
  you guys did n't even open the link . 
  it 's not a campaign towards people who have been brainwashed , it 's a campaign targeted towards their relatives . 
  mostly to remind parents that they can call a help line if they have any doubt about their teen 's behaviour . 
  it has proven to be effective and prevent some departures . 
  do n't be so cynical and racist / r/europe . 
  ** france ** : the us elections obviously dominated this week . 
  in franco-french news : - ** one year anniversary of the bataclan and paris attacks ** . 
  gets a lot of media coverage obviously . 
  sting was singing tonight at the bataclan . 
  there was a minute of silence yesterday before the football game against sweden . 
  a ceremony for the victims will be held tomorrow ( and should be quite simple from what i 've heard ... it 's a bit touchy : authorities have to commemorate , and they want to , but they also know that if they appear to use it as a political tool for the upcoming campaign they 'll get criticism . 
  several other ceremonies have happened over the past months , i do n't think people would be very happy if hollande kept making speeches for his own political gain ) . 
  - ** journalists at news channel i-t\u00e9l\u00e9 have been on strike for a month , with no end in sight ** . 
  see an [ older comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58vhjr/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20161023/d940hl3/ ) of mine to learn more . 
  ( in short : they are protesting against the hiring of a man with very questionable journalistic ethics , who is under investigation for abusing minors , and more broadly their fear of losing their independence since their channel was bought last year by a millionaire who wants to turn into an `` infotainmant '' mess ) .
