  - ** nurses and other hospital employees have been on strike but it did n't make the headlines at all ** . 
  when policemen organize illegal protests , we do hear about it though ... - ** a french journalist is currently under arrest in turkey for no reason ** . 
  i think that 's it . 
  ** france ** : - ** the calais `` jungle '' was dismantled this week . 
  ** and ( contrary to how it was apparently reported in british newspapers ) it went okay : no eruption of violence , no chaos . 
  about 6000 adult migrants have been evacuated from the camp between monday and wednesday and were sent to reception centres all over the country . 
  1500 minors are in a center in calais . 
  the uk finally accepted about 250 of these children . 
  some migrants ( who left the camp before the evacuation began and/or refused to be evacuated ) are still around calais but it 's difficult to say how many . 
  there are many migrants in paris too : some say they 've seen an increase this week , while others say the increase does n't have any link with the dismantling in calais , ie : they did n't come from there . 
  - ** according to a poll , only 4 % of the french are satisfied with hollande . 
  will he be candidate or will pm manuel valls take his place ? 
  ** nothing much to add . 
  hollande 's popularity is still very low , as you probably heard several times . 
  he is supposed to announce his candidacy ( to the primary ) in december and it seems that he still wants to re-run and is confident , but more and more people ( including close allies ) are said to be pushing for him to drop . 
  manuel valls is considered to be the obvious substitute and he does seem to be preparing for it , but nothing is sure at the moment , we are going to have to wait . 
  it 's a mess . 
  to sum up , the left still seems to be done for , there is still no visible light at the end of the tunnel for next year 's elections . 
  - ** the unemployment figures are improving slightly though . 
  ** but it 's not audible . 
  - ** journalists at news channel i-t\u00e9l\u00e9 have been on strike for 2 weeks , ( mainly ) over the hiring of a presenter under investigation for sexual coercion of minors ** : ( copy & paste from last week 's thread ) : jean-marc morandini is a phenomenal dickhead who started his career as one the first inventors of trash tv in france in the 90s . 
  he then specialised in the coverage/commentary of `` media news '' , alternatively on the tv and on the radio ( and managed to become more respected , but many people still ca n't stand him , he comes across as a massive douchebag ) . 
  a few months ago , he was still hosting his successful daily radio show ( for more than a decade at this point ) as well as a shitty crime tv show , and was also making lots of money with 2 websites specialised on media/people news and health ( ... ! ) . 
  there were apparently rumors that he would ask young males for sexual favors , but i never knew if it was true or not ( sadly many gay celebs have suffered from these types of unfounded rumors and since he 's particularly despised by a lot of french people i assumed it was probably just baseless rumors , and that anyway the guys were probably much younger than him but adults ) . 
  a few months ago a scandal emerged : he 's being accused of sexual harassment . 
  he allegedly asked several aspirant young actors to strip naked and masturbate as part as auditions for a ( shitty sounding ) web series . 
  ( it also seems that he would contact them online/via text messages and pretend to be his female casting director ... did she exist ? ) . 
  these guys were adults . 
  following that , another investigation was launched after a man came forward saying morandini asked him a similar thing a few years ago , when he was a minor and visited his home . 
  his radio station suspended him . 
  he was in negociations with i-t\u00e9l\u00e9 to launch a new tv show on the 24/7 news channel and the journalists who were already really not pleased voiced their opposition . 
  well their boss ignored them . 
  on monday morandini started his show . 
  journalists and technicians went on strike . 
  there were actually no adverts during his show because all brands refused to be associated with him !, 
  it actually goes deeper than that : his hiring was the last straw . 
  the channel was bought last year by a millionaire and since then staff have been vocal about their disagreement over the rebranding of their channel and had already gone on strike . 
  they have n't been told how the channel will evolve ( there are rumors about new programs being launched , new presenters being hired who clearly do n't fit the editorial line of i-t\u00e9l\u00e9 . 
  basically it 's all about viewership : it looks like it will be turned into entertainment although it was 24/7 serious news until then ) . 
  they are also very critical about the new management methods . 
  so this story is quite a big deal in france and it goes deeper than the sexual scandal allegations . 
  it 's not just this group either : a handful of french millionaires gradually bought newspapers and tv channels in the past decade and the independence of our media is really compromised . 
  he 's innocent until proven guilty , the investigation is still ongoing , he has n't been tried nor charged . 
  - ** cops organized protests last week . 
  hollande met with the unions this week . 
  it seems that the protests have slowed down , but this issue will probably remain present is the news in the next months . 
  ** ( see [ last week 's comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58vhjr/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20161023/d940hl3/ ) if you are interested ... or google it . ), 
  - ** right-wing politician jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 sparked an outrage ... after underestimating the price of pains au chocolat ** he was asked during a radio interview how much a pain au chocolat costs and replied `` i have no idea , no clue ... it depends on the size ... maybe 10 to 15 cents '' ( so roughly 10 times less than the average price ) . 
  `` okay , well , but journalists need to stop asking these types of questions that are only meant to trick and ridicule politicians '' , you may say ... 
  yes , we can have this debate but in his case it 's going to be difficult to win : a few years ago jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 said to a journalist that he had heard stories about kids whose pains au chocolat had been torn from their hands by muslims who told them they were not allowed to eat because it was ramadan ( and he even tweeted it : `` there are neighbourhood where children ca n't eat their pain au chocolat because it 's ramadan '' ) ... which of course is false , never was proven . 
  jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 is one of the 7 candidates of the primary ( the seventh actually , at 1 % in the polls ...  ( he is also the one who was supposed to be in charge of overseeing sarkozy 's campaign returns in 2012 ... remember ? 
  sarkozy exploded the maximum amount allowed ) . 
  - ** a 76 years-old millionaire woman was kidnapped in nice . 
  a former employee is the main suspect . 
  ** it sounds like the scenario of a movie . 
  she was kidnapped during the day , while she was coming back from the pharmacy : 2 men grabbed her and pushed her in a van . 
  she had already been kidnapped in 2013 !, 
  after 2 days inside the van , a neighbour noticed there were 2 licence plates ( on top of each other ) and looked inside and rescued her ( she had actually managed to escape the day before but was quickly re-captured by her kidnappers , crazy story ) . 
  the investigation is focusing on a former employee , a chef at one of her restaurants which went bankrupt ... 
  what did she say ? 
  oh , germans !, 
  a few days ago , i heard on the news something about a group of 3 neonazis who had been convicted for a series of murders ... apparently dna evidence in the case of a murdered little girl recently proved they were also likely responsible for her death , which led to investigations of other missing children cases to be reopened ... 
  i do n't remember if i heard that more than a week ago or only 2 days ago ... anything new ? 
  ( i 'm thinking about it after writing about the omar raddad case in france ) . 
  ** france ** : - ** hundreds of police officers organized protests all week long , asking for better working conditions , following a brutal attack against 2 of their colleagues earlier this month ** : 2 weeks ago , two police officers were seriously injured in viry-ch\u00e2tillon ( paris suburb ) , when a dozen young men set fire to their car . 
  both officers sustained severe burns : a policewoman wo n't be able to use her hands , her male colleague is i believe still in a coma . 
  ( their assaillants still have n't been identified ) . 
  that was the last straw : policemen have had a particularly difficult year with the terrorist attacks and the state emergency , as well as months of protests against the labour reform ; they have been voicing their discontent over their working conditions for months . 
  last weekend hundreds or maybe a thousand of policemen protested in the afternoon , and every night this week hundreds protested again in paris and in other cities . 
  their protests were not legal : you obviously have to ask for authorization in advance and of course you ca n't stage a protest on the champs elys\u00e9es at midnight , police officers are n't allowed to protest during work hours , and they ca n't wear their uniforms nor use police equipment ( police cars ) . 
  most of them were also hiding their faces , which again is n't legal . 
  the head of national police 's response was to order his staff to respect those rules to warn them that sanctions would be taken . 
  prime minister manuel valls said the same thing ( they ca n't lose faith and have to appear in control of their men ) . 
  of course this reaction only fueled these protesters ' anger : after that , they asked for their boss and their minister 's resignation . 
  police union had actually already met with the interior minister following the brutal attack of the 2 police officers . 
  these protests seem to have appeared spontaneously , led by hundreds of law enforcement employees who were not happy with what came out of it and want more . 
  they claim they are n't affiliated with any political party and are fed up with the unions ( who do n't listen to what policemen on the ground ask for , who only are there to climb the ladder ) . 
  the first secretary of the socialist party made some allegations , saying these protests were `` sponsored '' by the national front . 
  it seems false but one of the only two guys who talked to the media - taking the role of spokesperson , others refusing to come forward for fear of sanctions - and who stressed `` we 're not affiliated with any political party , nor any workers ' union '' turned out to be ... a * former * cop ... affiliated with the national front : he was candidate on a national front list in the municipal elections of 2014 ... 
  there was also at least one guy wearing a `` punisher '' skull mask . 
  others say they are angry this `` spokesperson '' decided to `` hijack '' their cause . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande will meet a delegation of police officers this week . 
  so yeah , what are they asking for ? 
  better working conditions : more men so they are n't overworked in the stressful context we 're currently in , better equipment and offices instead of the old uniforms and decrepit police stations they work with . 
  also many ask for a reform so that `` when [ they ] shoot someone , they are presumed to be in self defense '' ... - ** journalists at news channel i-t\u00e9l\u00e9 have been on strike all week , ( mainly ) over the hiring of a presenter under investigation for sexual coercion of minors ** : jean-marc morandini is a phenomenal dickhead who started his career as one the first inventors of trash tv in france in the 90s .
