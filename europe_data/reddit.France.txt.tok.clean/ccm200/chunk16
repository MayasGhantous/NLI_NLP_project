  they have n't been told how the channel will evolve ( there are rumors about new programs being launched , new presenters being hired who clearly do n't fit the editorial line of i-t\u00e9l\u00e9 . 
  basically it 's all about viewership : it looks like it will be turned into entertainment although it was 24/7 serious news until then ) . 
  they are also very critical about the new management methods . 
  so this story is quite a big deal in france and it goes deeper than the sexual scandal allegations . 
  it 's not just this group either : a handful of french millionaires gradually bought newspapers and tv channels in the past decade and the independence of our media is really compromised . 
  he 's innocent until proven guilty , the investigation is still ongoing , he has n't been tried nor charged . 
  - ** identification of dna evidence could finally solve one of the most famous french criminal cases and really exculpate the man charged for it ** : known as the `` omar m ' a tuer '' case . 
  i wo n't write about it because it 's quite long to explain , but i encourage you to read [ this article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/who-really-killed-ghislaine-marchal-2041696.html ) , if you like mysterious criminal cases . 
  so basically , this article is 6 years old and they only finally compared the dna traces found in her blood ... and it matched with someone who is registered in the national database of convicted or suspected people ... 
  the identity has n't been revealed !, 
  we learned there was a `` match '' 3 or 4 days ago and apparently we ( and omar raddad ) are going to have to wait a few more days to know . 
  and there may be more than one killer , so maybe that 's why it 's taking some time , i do n't know why this information was revealed and by whom but i 'm happy for this poor man who always proclaimed his innocence and was never cleared . 
  ( yes , `` omar m ' a tuer '' really did enter `` french pop culture '' and is still quite regularly used in everyday life ) . 
  - ** an american couple donates a 350 million euros art collection to the orsay museum !, 
  ** this american couple decided to donate 187 pieces of art to the parisian museum , apparently because they love paris and also because the law here ensures their collection will remain propriety of the french collection or something whereas apparently art lovers have been angry at some us museums for selling paintings that had been donated to them by private collectors . 
  to thank them , they were awarded the l\u00e9gion d'honneur yesterday - ** the calais `` jungle '' will be dismantled next week ** : starting monday . 
  most migrants are said to have agreed to move to other locations . 
  but many `` no borders '' activists are said to be in calais and ready to fight against it . 
  more than a thousand policemen are there . 
  - ** the 1st round of the green party primary was held : the candidate who was thought to be the favourite lost , finishing 3rd and thus not being qualified ** . 
  nobody really cared . 
  the party has pretty much always been a mess . 
  it 's not that much of a surprise . 
  the woman who was the most popular ( media wise ) and who was minister under hollande before quitting ( when valls became pm and she did n't agree with this clearly right-leaning government ) came third . 
  the man and woman who are qualified for the second round are quite good , but they are n't popular at all ( the party is small , no one knew there was a primary , the media barely covered it ) . 
  they wo n't be making huge numbers in may . 
  it 's a pity , but internal tensions over the line and over who should represent the party have existed inside eelv ( name of the party ) since its creation . 
  ( sorry for the probably numerous grammar mistakes . 
  i know i always make many and i 'm even too lazy to re-read all this this week  do n't hesitate to point them out - via pm if you do n't want to clutter this thread ) . 
  ** france ** : - ** `` a president should n't say that '' : a book was published and it does n't help hollande 's popularity . 
  ** also : ** hollande wants to run again , it 's now almost official ** ( ... or is it ? ), 
  -2 journalists from * le monde * interviewed fran\u00e7ois hollande more than 60 times over the last 5 years . 
  the book was published this week and it is full of quotes that wo n't help hollande for his reelection : ( this was agreed upon even before hollande became president : he agreed to give them private meetings throughout his years as president - if he became president , of course - , on the condition that the book was published at the end of his mandate . ), 
  hollande looooves journalists . 
  nothing new , it 's something that had already been highlighted . 
  one may wonder whether he is a failed editorialist ; it seems that his ego as a politician depends more on his popularity amongst journalists ( than on power itself , which seems like a means to attract the media 's attention on himself ) . 
  the man sure loves to talk to journalists , so when these 2 suggested the idea of meeting with him periodically so that he could talk about his experience as president , he probably felt flattered ... 
  he also very likely agreed because he thought that it would be an excellent tactical move to help his reelection . 
  but , unfortunately for him , things did n't go as planned : he had a plan that basically consisted in doing some harsh economic reforms during the first 2 years of his mandate , which would be followed ( so he thought ) by visible progress in the last 2 or 3 years . 
  but the unemployement stats did n't actually improve . 
  his popularity never stopped decreasing . 
  the context changed drastically with the terrorist attacks , etc. . . 
  so the book is entitled '' `` a president should n't say that ... '' the secrets of a quinquennium '' . 
  it is a quote from hollande , who himself knew that some of the things he said should probably have been kept off the record , and who knew that they would indeed be published anyway ( he had agreed to , they did n't fool or betray him ) . 
  one quote in particular proved to be quite disastrous , he even had to apologize : `` these prosecutors , these senior judges , they hide themselves , they act as righteous ... they do n't like politicians . '', 
  ( hollande always prided himself on not interfering with the justice sytem - ... unlike sarkozy - but - like sarkozy - he insulted them and it became public knowledge ... ) other ** quotes ** include : `` that there 's a problem with islam , it 's true . 
  no one doubts it . 
  it is not islam that poses a problem in the sense that it would be a religion that is dangerous in itself , but it 's because islam wants to affirm itself as a religion inside the republic ... '' ( ... 
  if he had said : `` if a religion wants to overcome/surpass the republic institutions and principles , it 's a problem '' ... but he did n't say that , he said there was indeed a problem with islam which is that islam wants to `` affirm itself '' `` inside the republic '' . 
  la\u00efcit\u00e9 fucking does n't mean that religions should disappear , for god 's sake !, 
  the state does n't recognize them , is separated from them , but they should be able to run freely and openly !, 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  terrorist attacks = a religion `` affirming itself '' inside the republic ? 
  insinuating that veiled muslim women are n't french ( they become french , if they stop wearing it ) , criticizing the national football team : `` they turned from badly raised kids into super rich celebrities , with no preparation , they are n't psycholgically prepared to know what is good or bad '' ( well , okay , that 's quite a generalization , but i would personally agree that overall this argument can be made . 
  but he does n't stop there  he goes on to talk about a `` communitisation '' , an `` ethicisation '' inside the team ... ( what does he specifically mean by that ? 
  what is he referring to ? 
  i have n't read the book , i can only translate the quotes published in the press , but i think if he had explained what actual `` terrible facts '' he was referring to , it would have been published as well in the press ) , recognizing that he indeed nicknamed the poor `` toothless '' . 
  ( = something that his ex - val\u00e9rie trierweiler - had written about and caused a controversy in 2014 . 
  at the time he was asked whether it was true or not , and i do n't remember whether he declined to comment or refuted it , but now we know that when these 2 journalists talked with him at the time he confessed it was `` true , of course '' but it was not meant to be degarotary or to mock them ... his ex , reacted by tweeting an old text message from him in which he was using this term `` the toothless '' as a joke that deshumanizes the poor - we obviously ca n't check its veracity , so anyone can choose to believe him or her , or none of them ) . 
  so he apologized towards magistrates , but no one even asked him to , or suggested he should , apologize towards muslims , football players , or poor people . 
  overall the book has been reviewed as quite self-centered . 
  it presumably depicts a man who was very isolated in the last 4 years . 
  - the day after the publication of this book , an interview was published in `` le nouvel observateur '' newspaper . 
  it was apparently supposed to be a big one : the title says `` i 'm ready '' . 
  hollande and his communication team meant it to be the launch of his campaign for reelection . 
  but , unfortunately for him , it was completely overshadowed by the quotes from the book . 
  the interview was mentioned in the media ( i have n't bothered reading it , it is said to be a lengthy itw in which hollande goes back on his successes and failures quite convincingly in order to appear credible enough to be able to run again ) but most journalists were still reviewing the quotes from the book ... - ** alain jupp\u00e9 still leads before nicolas sarkozy , as the first debate between the 7 `` les r\u00e9publicains '' candidates was held this week ** . 
  alain jupp\u00e9 was said to be the favorite since the beginning of the campaign ( even before that ) . 
  it has n't changed : several recent polls confirm that his advance is quite important ( but you never know : there never was a primary in the right , so it 's hard to predict how many people will vote ) . 
  sarkozy 's right-leaning campaign is n't attracting people ( he still has an important base of hard core fans , but that 's not enough ) . 
  the first ( of 3 ) televised debates occurred this week . 
  i did n't watch it , apparently it was quite uneventful , predictable and there is no clear winner ( alain jupp\u00e9 was said to be the winner , but mainly because he was able to confirm his stature ) . 
  - ** salah abdeslam 's lawyers announced they gave up representing him , because he refuses to talk . 
  ** the surviving member of the terrorist cell behind the november paris attacks had told them he would cooperate with the justice . 
  but he never did . 
  as a result , his two lawyers gave up . 
  remaining silent is his right , but when they met with to see whether they would represent or not , he promised them to collaborate , and he never did . 
  -------------------------------------- and i 'll stop here for this week , because that was very long already ( apologies ) . 
  so very political week . 
  if you want a short summary : - ** on the right ( and centre ) : first round of the primary on the 20th of november . 
  alain jupp\u00e9 is leading quite largely in the polls , sarkozy is second . 
  ** - ** on the left : primary in january . 
  hollande seemed to finally officially announce his desire to run again this week ( = to be candidate in the upcoming primary between the left and the ecologists ) , but it kinda failed ... manuel valls could replace him , we 'll know in december . 
  there are 5 or 6 other candidates declared for this primary ( arnaud montebourg - left of the party - is apparently doing well , but it seems way too early to predict anything ) . 
  ** the winner of the `` les r\u00e9publicains '' primary will very likely be opposed to marine le pen in may 2017 : our next president will very likely be alain jupp\u00e9 . 
  merci !, 
  well i used to do these every week , but i stopped , for 2 reasons : 1-these threads used to be stickied as soon as they were created by the bot . 
  i knew that each sunday , i could log on and type a lengthy comment here and many people would see it . 
  people from other countries would type their own report and there would often be interesting comments/questions . 
  -  in the past months , they stopped stickying them ( there would always be 2 other threads instead ) and so no one would see it , no one would comment ( well , usually there would be one or two brave people , writing a short report that only a handful of redditors saw , and generated zero reply ... ) it was n't worth my time . 
  i do like to make these reports ; at first i would write short ones and then they gradually became longer and longer , because i ca n't seem to be able to be concise !, 
  and also because i like to give my point of view ( on top of providing a summary that is as objective as possible imo ) . 
  but when i realised that the last ( lengthy ) reports i had written had been seen and read by virtually no one because the thread never reached the front page of the sub , i thought it was n't worth it . 
  at the end of the day , if i think that i will have almost zero reader , why bother ? 
  2-i also had my reports hidden/automatically deleted by a bot twice !, 
  why ? 
  because on 2 consecutive occasions i used some words that triggered the bot !, 
  ( i used the n-word : to explain that someone had said something that was the equivalent of the n-word in french and it caused a controversy that was worthy of making the headlines : i was simply explaining the story . 
  the second time i do n't even remember but it was even more stupid . 
  i asked the mods what word ( s ) exactly triggered the bot ( the bot apparently has a list of words that automatically makes it `` shadowban '' a comment , because it thinks it 's insulting ... and the redditor only realises when the score stays at 1 and no one replies ) and they did n't even tell me what word caused this ( if i remember well , i was trying to guess and i could n't understand : i only used ` sensitive ' words like `` migrants '' , `` muslims '' , `` terrorists '' , `` islamist '' ... because that was in the news that week ... no swear word at all ! ),
