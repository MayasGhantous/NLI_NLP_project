  -  it happened twice in a row , i had to message the mods after i guessed what had happened . 
  they apologised and were quick to put my comment back , but hours had passed ... 
  so this , plus the fact that the weekly thread was n't stickied each week anymore made me stop caring . 
  -------------------------------------- when i saw that last week 's thread became stickied ( and so visible ) , i thought i would start this again ... but you see on sunday there were 2 other stickied threads and so the last one never reached a sufficient visibility : so i did n't bother to comment ( although last week was interesting because the main headline would have been `` sarkozy has had a pretty bad week '' : several stories which were quite bad for him made the headline ) . 
  ---------------------- i simply follow the news on tv , the radio , newspapers , social media . 
  nothing in particular . 
  ** france ** - ** 2 teenagers have been arrested for the hoax terror alert in paris last saturday ( swatting ) ** . 
  you may remember that last saturday , hundreds of policemen and swat team members were sent to a church in the middle of paris , for an alleged hostage situation . 
  ( it was heritage day : lots of people were visiting museums and historical bulidings ) . 
  ( at first , reports were wrong : we were told that a woman who was inside the church saw several men running in front of the buliding and that she immediately thought it was a terrorist attack . 
  she supposedly closed the door , told everyone inside to hide and some of these people called the police , saying they were hostages ... 
  okay , well she was paranoid , but can you blame her ? 
  she probably anticipated something like this could happen and when she thought it did occur , she reacted very quickly . 
  if that had been the case , we would be celebrating her ... ... well , it turns out , that 's not what happened ) . 
  it was a swatting hoax . 
  two teenage boys , aged 14 and 16 have confessed to it . 
  they called the police , pretending to be a priest inside the church who had just seen a dozen armed men enter ... 
  they even bragged about it to journalists ( whom they contacted themselves i believe ) , explaining they were doing it for the thrill of it , `` for the buzz '' , and that if people feared for their lives , well it was not their problem . 
  they bragged about it on facebook , and they told the journalist that `` no way they could be tracked down '' ... well they were wrong , the police arrested them . 
  ( now , are they `` just '' stupid kids ? 
  they really do n't sound bright , they did explain that they were doing it only for the `` lulz '' , but they are fans of a rather famous franco-israeli `` swatter '' , named ulcan . 
  this ulcan guy `` swatted '' several people already : mostly journalists who wrote articles in favour of the palestinian cause . 
  if i remember correctly , he targeted the elderly father of one journalist , and this old man died a few days later , very likely because of the shock ( he was already very ill ) this dates back to 1 or 2 years ago and as far as i know , this ulcan guy is safe , because israel refuses to collaborate with french authorities ... 
  so are these two just `` stupid kids '' or can we consider that their actions were politically motivated ? 
  the trial will probably have to determine it , but this fact was not mentioned in the mainstream media - who are mostly explaining what `` swatting '' is and do n't seem to know/care about ulcan ) . 
  apparently at least one of the two teenage boys bragged about the fact that he already took part in previous swattings ( hoax bomb in some schools i believe ) . 
  - ** several people suspected of terrorism have been arrested this week ** . 
  - the sister of one of the most famous french jihadist ( fabien clain ) was arrested as soon as she landed from syria ( after being expelled from turkey ) with her husband and kids . 
  ( i do n't know the details , why she came back from syria ... 
  i have n't read the details , i do n't know if the secret services know that she intended to carry attacks in france , or if she and her family came back in europe after a disappointing experience with isis . ), 
  - two teenage girls from nice have been arrested for exchanging with famous other french jihadist based in syria ( rachid kassim ) through telegram . 
  ( they confessed chatting about planning attacks , before renouncing . 
  this rachid kassim guy is famous for prompting several french jihadists to carry out attacks , through telegram . 
  i also do n't know why it seems that the secret services are now able to spy on telegram communications : this app is encrypted , its founder always publicly said he would n't collaborate and the interior minister always complained about it ... have they managed to infiltrate it lately and still have n't been identified by the jihadists using the chat rooms ?! ), 
  - a young man with a `` fiche s '' ( suspected of radicalization ) was arrested in rouen after he was seen taking pictures of the university . 
  - ** new measures this year to make sure schools are more protected in case of a terrorist attack ** . 
  ( not really a piece of news per say , but it 's something that obviously has been talked about quite a lot this month so i thought it was worth mentioning . 
  our schools are really less equiped than in the uk for instance , so even if the education minister obviously launched new plans blablabla , it 's clear that it we are not ready . 
  it will take years and millions of euros before we can say all schools are sufficiently equiped , and even then , you ca n't have a 100 % protection . 
  what can you do , everyone is doing their best , lots of teachers are discussing it this month ) . 
  - ** pope francis met with a delegation of victims and families of victims from nice ** . 
  - ** jails : several `` incidents '' + the issue of overpopulation in french prisons is reopened ** . 
  there has been several ( 3 or 4 ? 
  i 've lost count ) similar incidents in french jails in the past few weeks : 3 or 4 prisoners attacking prison guards , stealing their keys , opening cells and setting fire to the infrastructures . 
  last one was just yesterday ( as i 'm typing i do n't know if it 's over ) . 
  this comes at a time when the issue of the overpopulation of our prisons is being discussed again . 
  each government promises to build new prisons , but it takes decades , we still have a major issue with overpopulated cells , old infrastructures , awful conditions for the inmates and for the guards , who are not numerous enough . 
  ( in case you are wondering : i 'm not 100 % sure , but i think none of the inmates who started these `` incidents '' were convicted for terrorism . 
  the reason they started these ` riots ' was to complain about their condition , like for instance asking to be sent to another jail ( closer to their family ) which was refused , etc. ), 
  - ** former president jacques chirac is hospitalized ** . 
  he 's still in hospital . 
  it 's been several days , it 's quite serious , but we do n't have many details . 
  ( so i guess he could die fairly soon ... actually a rumor on twiiter already stated that he was dead ... which was followed by the family having to issue a statement saying something like `` nope , not yet , please respect our privacy '' ... oops ) . 
  ( his wife bernadette was also hospitalized a few days later , but she is better now ) . 
  - ** sarkozy is still trying to seduce far right voters by focusing on identity : this week he said that `` immigrants must accept that as soon as you become french , your/our ancestors are gaulois '' ** . 
  his party 's primaries are in november , so the campaign really started this month . 
  sarkozy is still focusing on the same issues , and identity is a big talking point of his . 
  a few years ago , he said something along the lines of `` as the son of a hungarian jewish man , [ he ] was proud of being part of france 's tradition , made of successive immigration waves that all assimilated into french society '' . 
  he even said at the time , that when he learned about `` our gaulois ancestors '' in school , he was aware that his own ancestors were n't part of that lineage . 
  so now , he 's using an even more right leaning rhetoric . 
  and of course when you reply to him , saying that before the gauls , there were many other peoples in the territory that is now french , and that after the gauls , many other peoples inhabited this territory , he 's pretending that you purposefully misinterpreted what he meant ... what he said was simply that in order for immigrants to integrate , they need to embrace the country 's values and history , etc. 
  ( this famous `` our gaulois ancestors '' phrase actually dates back to the 19th century , when it was coined as the `` national narrative '' in history books , to make sure that all pupils had a common view , which was useful to unite the net generations ... 
  the gauls were chosen as a focus point in the definition of the national identity ( instead of many other that also were historically relevant ) because they were seen as the embodiment of the french lower class . ), 
  - ** calais is ( still ) ( and will continue to be ) an important topic for the upcoming presidential campaign ** . 
  many candidates are visiting the city . 
  sarkozy went there this week , hollande too . 
  but it 's still as complicated as it was ~ ~ months ~ ~ years ago . 
  - ** hollande recognized `` the responsibility of the governments of france in the abandonment of the harkis '' ** . 
  ` harkis ' = algerians who fought alongside the french colonizers during the algerian wars ... and whom france left behind . 
  ( the vast majority of them ) . 
  - ** former soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale trader jer\u00f4me kerviel now owes 1 million , instead of several billions . 
  ** too lazy to write about it , it 's long and complex . 
  here 's [ an artcle in english ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/court-slashes-damages-owed-by-former-socgen-trader-jerome-kerviel ) if you 're interested . 
  i wish i had the motivation to do it , but i would really like to see a thorough analysis of all the articles published in the french and british media , regarding their `` rival '' . 
  on this sub for instance , i 'm convinced you would find * at least * 10 times more `` french-bashing '' articles from the brits , than `` british-bashing '' papers in french newspapers . 
  we simply do not care about you guys , really !, 
  the french media treated the british team the same way they treated all the others big nations . 
  french people are happy about the number of medals , especially since the first days of this year 's olympics were desastrous for us . 
  we do not care about the brits . 
  french journalists mostly talked about the french athletes ( pretty logic ) . 
  they covered the `` controversies '' such as the one about cycling , but , i mean they did so in a * normal * way , they are not obsessed ( ! ), 
  with the brits , really . 
  one guy said that , a coach : that 's human , and maybe he was right ( we have no real way to know right now ) . 
  this article complains about the fact that le monde suggests mo farah might have been doped ( i personally have n't heard any french commentator talk about that , it 's possible , they did mention many athletes ' past convictions for doping ... that 's part of their job ! ), 
  well le monde writes that bbc itself revealed allegations about mo farah 's coach . 
  as for cycling : we all know very well the tour de france has had a huge problem and many athletes were very likely still doped this year , and the `` engines '' inside the bikes are not a conspiracy theory either . 
  so : we have no evidence that was the case for the gb team in rio , but asking the question sounds `` reasonable '' to me . 
  ( i do agree , the way this coach phrased it was not correct at all . 
  well , that 's one guy . 
  not a proof of france 's obsession with the brits . 
  we like you , but we do n't care that much about you , sorry ) . 
  well you included me in that group and i can tell you i was n't fooled by his bourget speech . 
  no one cares in france . 
  of course we talked about it , but really we do n't care . 
  yes but the `` left bubble '' in the southern countries seems to be over now . 
  it seems that after some years of hoping something good would actually come out of syriza , podemos and the likes , the southern populations are reacting to the brexit by turing to `` traditional '' conservative parties again , in fear of seeing far-right movements win too much power . 
  i could be wrong , that 's how i feel it . 
  i have a feeling right-wing governments will be elected in the south of europe , again , in the next months and years . 
  ( the `` left bubble '' did ` nt manage to grow enough , it 's over now ) . 
  - our presidents have had pretty bad ratings , it 's been getting worse and worse in the past decades .
