  ( i think that 's also the case in many other countries ) . 
  - unemployment numbers are bad . 
  hollande made 1 main promise at the beginning of his mandate : he would not try to be reelected if the unemployment numbers had n't improved by the end of his 5 years . 
  he is convinced they are finally starting to improve and people ( do n't see it now but they ) will notice the improvements in the next few months , just before the start of the presidential campaign . 
  - people did n't exactly vote for hollande in 2012 , they voted against sarkozy . 
  from the beginning , hollande knew he would have to keep in mind that many of his voters were on the right of the spectrum : and he did not forget !!!, 
  but he clearly forgot about the left-wingers who also helped him win . 
  how ironic . 
  - during his campaign , one of his most memorable promises was that he would `` fight the financial world '' . 
  ( people who believed it were being naive , but you ca n't blame them for being angry now and reminding him of his own words . 
  - hollande is a strategist . 
  he campaigned on being a `` normal person/president '' ( as opposed to sarkozy 's exuberant personality everyone was so fed up with ) . 
  but i think people felt betrayed : i do n't think the majority sees him as being a `` strategist '' like i do , the thing that still comes up is that he is weak , not presidential enough ( the french do like `` strong '' , authoritative men ... ) it 's true that he 's a very bad public speaker , i ca n't bare to listen to him anymore ( sarkozy infuriated me , hollande frustrates me , i do n't know what 's worse ) . 
  - recently there 's been the social conflict against the labour reform , which he passed using an antidemocratic article of the constitution , even though that was n't part of his campaign , even though the majority of the french do n't support it . 
  ( and even though he had in the past criticized the use of this constitutional article , when the right was using it ... ) - before that , he came up with the proposed bill of depriving terrorists of their citizenship ... even though he was against it just a few months before ( between the `` charlie hebdo '' attacks and the november attacks ) , because it 's historically , ideologically a far-right proposal . 
  - on the eu , during his campaign he promised he would renegociate european treaties as soon as elected . 
  he did n't . 
  - the one good thing everyone remembers is gay marriage . 
  but the charismatic minister who presented it resigned a few months later , criticizing his right-wing politics . 
  ( and personally , i wo n't forgive the fact that , after right-wingers protested for months , hollande promised them that mayors would have the right to decline marrying same sex couples . 
  like , wtf , a left-wing president who congratulates himself for not giving up his gay marriage law but wants to give something to his opponents , as usual ... so typical of him . 
  it 's either legal and mayors have to do it , or it 's not . 
  if they do n't want to do it cause they 're homophobic or have `` personal reservations '' , then they quit ! ), 
  ---------------------------------------------------- everyone else here agrees that marine le pen will be in the second round but will be beaten , probably by alain jupp\u00e9 ( who has slightly more favorable ratings than sarkozy right now ) ... 
  i think this is going to be an unpredictable campaign . 
  and it worries me ( even if on paper , things can only be at least a bit better than that ... - i do n't think mlp can be elected - but i 'm more and more anxious about the months to come ) . 
  guess what ? 
  this brought me to tears , but not for the reason you might expect , and it might comfort you brits : 3 years ago in france , when homophobia increased very significantly while gay marriage was being debated ( and finally adopted , after months of ugly `` debates '' ) , well ... we did n't have radio hosts like this . 
  yes , many journalists and politicians would denounce the violence of the propaganda , its hypocrisy and how gradually it fueled the hate and lead to the massive increase of homophobic violence . 
  but they were doing it in a `` professional '' way , it was `` detached '' , it did n't seem as genuine and heartfelt as these 2 guys . 
  it was less powerful , not audible enough to really strongly counter the homophobic propaganda . 
  you 're going to tell me , it 's just 7 minutes in 1 radio show , but this is something that struck me when i lived in england : on the one hand you have worse tabloids than we do , but on the other hand journalists do n't hesitate to call bullshit when they see it and express that * they * feel , deep down in their hearts and brains , that this or that propagandistic argument or attitude should not be tolerated , but despised and mocked . 
  they do it while remaining professional and addressing the serious arguments of the debate , whereas the french tend to act like it 's just another piece of news `` homophobia is increasing , it 's ugly , here are the stats , it 's obviously related to how this debate is being handled . 
  oh well , next subject . '', 
  i 've traveled a bit around europe and the irish were the nicest people i 've met . 
  the stereotypes i had about ireland were completely verified : beautiful landscapes , welcoming people who are always joyful and ready to sing ( ... & not just in touristic places , it really seemed genuine ) . 
  very easy to talk to , even for someone like me who is a bit shy . 
  ( i 'm female and the guys were not pushy . 
  well some were but i did n't feel they were aggressive , contrary to in lots of other places ) . 
  i 100 % recommend visiting ireland : for its people . 
  my take on the karim benzema controversy if you are interested : ( this is my personal opinion and i do n't know much about football , so add your own comment if you disagree or if what i wrote is false ) : - there is an elephant in the room/skeleton in the closet in regards to france 's view of the part of its population who are descendants of immigrants . 
  this is mixed with the topic of islam . 
  this is something which is very much present in the ` public debate ' but which is not adressed in a healthy way . 
  the fact that the national front is very high attests it . 
  the fact that newspapers , editorialists , journalists and politicians from all tendencies jump on any occasion to create ` debates ' on this issue attests it . 
  yet/thus we ca n't discuss it in a calm and healthy way . 
  in the 80s , sons and daughters of north-african immigrants organized a massive peaceful national march to open the debate about the racism they were suffering . 
  their movement was quickly taken over by the socialist party : ` sos racisme ' was founded , they pretended to care , but they did nothing much in reality . 
  in the late 80s , the debate about islam started to emerge : from then on , the topics of the islamic veil , the halal food and the mosques were heavily used by politicians whenever they needed it ( sarkozy in particular , on top of his ` fight against insecurity ' ) . 
  in 1998 , when france won the football world cup , the whole country celebrated ` la france black-blanc-beur ' : our national team , with our very ethnically diverse players , were a source of enormous pride ; a proof that everything was going perfectly fine . 
  in 2005 , after two innocent teenagers died while trying to escape the police , protests erupted all over french suburbs : they were basically protesting about the same things . 
  10 years later , there is now an emerging debate about the `` new anti-racists '' : basically new groups claiming to be fighting against racism , but who are depicted by the majority as `` communautarists '' , as people who are actually `` racist towards the whites '' . 
  these are french descendants of immigrants who are tired of the old antiracism that is all talk and no action , and who want a * real * , political , form of antiracism . 
  therefore , their detractors are saying they are importing a trend from the us , and are actually racist themselves ( some kinds of ` sjws ' ) . 
  and we also had terrorist attacks , which were obviously at the center of the public debate in the past year . 
  - now , more specifically about what karim benzema said : i think he probably feels it 's unfair that * he * is the one who is the main target of the criticism against the national football team . 
  and ( again i 'm not a specialist , correct me if i 'm wrong ) from what i undertand , i can sympathise with him . 
  benzema was at the center of the ` sextape ' scandal : he allegedly tried to blackmail mathieu valbuena ( another player ) over a sex tape showing valbuena with a lady . 
  it seems that benzema has remained friends with some petty criminals he grew up with . 
  benzema has n't been charged with anything for now , it seems that the blackmail is difficult to prove . 
  ( his friends / people he knew had the tape , benzema was asked to blackmail valbuena : did he blackmail him or did he warn him about the tape in a ` friendly ' way/not realizing what he was doing was wrong/considered blackmail ? ), 
  well , if what football journalists are saying is true : that is , that most of the football players go see prostitutes pretty often , that they have this ` habit ' of exchanging sex tapes of themselves to prove they are ` cool , part of the same ` spirit ' , ' or to prove they are ` manly ' ... 
  i can understand that benzema feels it 's a bit unfair the way journalists like to cover his actions that much . 
  basically he 's the one who was stupid or unlucky enough to get caught and now he 's the one who is seen as a ` punching ball ' for all of his collegues ` actions ( past actions too ) . 
  football players have had a pretty bad reputation lately : with the revelations about ( underage ) prostitutes , their ` strike ' in south africa and more generally the fact that they are young men from low socio-economic backgrounds who are trained to become football players and win millions of euros very quickly while not having the mental abilities to know how to handle it . 
  they are seen as dumb , arrogant young men who are not even able to make the slighest efforts when they meet their young fans ( like smiling and giving autographs instead of keeping their headphones on and looking at their feet , totally ignoring the crowds ) . 
  politicians ( understanding that football can be a popular topic to talk about ) do n't refrain from commenting on the topic . 
  so when the ` sextape ' scandal occurred , when journalists were commenting polls saying that the majority of the french did n't want benzema to be part of the national team for the euro championship , obviously prime minister valls ( and even president hollande ) thought it was normal for them to give their opinion ( !, 
  ) : they publicly disowned benzema . 
  and then deschamps did n't select him ... was this mediatic and political debate totally out of deschamps ' mind when he made his list ? 
  i do n't know , but that 's basically what this whole controversy is about . 
  there is also the fact that benzema is really good when he plays with real madrid , but he 's always been disappointing when playing with the french national team . 
  so maybe , indeed , he 's just not a good element for this team and he 's playing the race card to victimize himself in a nasty way . 
  that 's what the majority says . 
  okay then , the majority is probably right , but if this is causing * so much * talks , it 's also because it touches on more important , wider issues . 
  and it would be good if we could open the debate on this , instead of pretending this little sentence was what is the only issue here . 
  i think the recent `` black m '' controversy illustrates a similar issue . 
  ( sorry : this is probably confusing . 
  i wanted to try and give an opinion but it 's complex , especially at this hour . 
  i did my best ) . 
  france : - ** floods !, 
  ** 4 people died . 
  after days of miserable weather , the seine river burst its banks south of paris and then in paris . 
  ( the floods are obviously moving from east to west : after making its way til paris on friday , the water is now receding slowly there but rising further west , in the normandy region ) . 
  in paris , the peak reached 6,10 meters . 
  which is similar to the flood of 1982 , but less than the [ historical floods of january 1910 ( 8,62 meters ! ) ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/meteo/inondations/crue-centennale/en-images-la-crue-centennale-de-1910-c-etait-ca_1480325.html ) . 
  several museums closed in order to prepare for an evacuation of the thousands of pieces of art which were under water levels . 
  several subway stations were closed as well . 
  a few parisians had water in their apartments but it was not that bad ; but south of paris many towns were completely flooded . 
  the fact that this can happen pretty regularly is known : last march there had been a simulation exactly for this in paris . 
  fun fact : a statue is used by parisians to assess the water levels . 
  but the comparisons with previous floods are not easy since the statue was moved in 1970 . 
  ( if you 're curious you can google translate [ this article ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/06/03/les-droles-de-mesures-de-crues-sur-le-zouave-du-pont-de-l-alma_4933609_4355770.html ) ) . 
  - ** labour reform protests ** : still going on , but received less attention , because of the floods . 
  ** police violence is starting to become an issue ** . 
  - there were strikes in public transports , but it did n't create much chaos . 
  there was another march , but it did n't draw a lot of attention . 
  the government is still staying firm . 
  basically the debate seems to be dying down , because there are other topics to mention in the news and because the strikes are causing less diruptions in people 's everyday lives ( very few fuel stations affected now for instance ) . 
  but honestly i would n't be surprised if things started to become really active again in a few days , we 'll see .
