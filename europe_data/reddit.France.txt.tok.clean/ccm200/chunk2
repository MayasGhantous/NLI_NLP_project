  but there 's a good news : - ** french hostage freed , after nearly 6 months in yemen ** . 
  i did n't even remember hearing about her kidnapping in february . 
  but we were still busy with the followings of the january attacks i suppose ) . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33814660 ) . ), 
  - ** french swimmers are doing good at the world championships in russia ** . 
  florent manaudou is winning lots of medals , mimicking what his sister did a few years ago . 
  - and ** investigations on the mh370 debris have begun ** . 
  you are all aware . 
  ** france ** : - ** debris found in la r\u00e9union `` almost certainly '' from mh370 ** . 
  you 've all heard about it i suppose . 
  the investigations will begin , i believe , on wednesday in toulouse . 
  ( the other `` things '' they found - bottles with indonesian/malaisian inscriptions and bag - will be sent to a parisian laboratory . 
  a parisian judge is investigating the crash . ), 
  4 of the victims were french . 
  side note : the volcano situated on the island has erupted this week . 
  - ** calais crisis ** . 
  you 've all heard about it too . 
  same old story , i wo n't develop on that . 
  - ** big fires in the gironde and var regions ** , last week and beginning of this week . 
  lots of people evacuated , material and environmental damage but no one injured . 
  all clear now . 
  - ** unemployment figures remain about the same ** . 
  - ** jean marie le pen wins legal victory against his daughter , who had removed his title as honorary party president ** . 
  dallas season 2569988987970970 recap : in april , jean-marie le pen made yet other comments about the gaz chambers and the vichy regime . 
  this time , marine le pen decided that was the last straw and suspended him from the national front party . 
  but according to the party rules , she ca n't actually do this : she needs to hold a general assembly and make the militants vote on this issue . 
  she announced it anyway , because she had to act quickly in order to demonstrate that she 's now completely willing to create a ` clean ' party . 
  and she was certain that the vast majority of her supporters would agree with this decision . 
  they organised a ballot and the results came this week : indeed , 94 % of the voters agreed to remove jean-marie le pen from his top position . 
  but still , this election is n't valid according to the justice : she 'll have to organise a proper congress in september or october , which 1 ) costs money , 2 ) will offer another public platform for her father to express himself , and he wo n't be nice towards her !, 
  3 ) will take place just before the regional elections in december . 
  ( to sum up : overall this whole episode * is * a good thing for the national front . 
  they will get rid of grandpa and have a clean slate in preparation for 2016 ( presidential campaign ) . 
  they will show that their electors support this decision . 
  but it 's gon na take another few months and collide with their regional campaign : marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen - jean-marie 's granddaughter and marine 's niece - took his place and is the fn candidate in nice , but jean-marie may still decide to be a candidate , in an opposing far-right movement ( unlikely now because i do n't think he will have enough time , but you never know ) . 
  yes , i told you : it 's dallas ! ), 
  - ** suggestions for the capital cities of france 's new regions have been announced ** . 
  no big surprises . 
  some people are crossed , but i think the majority does n't care , especially when we are on holiday . 
  - ** rent control regulations on all new or renewed leases enter into effect in paris ** . 
  - ** a 16-year-old french volunteer archaeologist has found an adult tooth dating back around 560,000 years in south-western france ** . 
  - ** our government is on holiday !, 
  ** for two weeks/20 days i think . 
  ** france ** i 'm late so i will make it very short , not many will see this i think so it 's not worth spending too much time on it . 
  - ** french farmers protested against falling prices ** . 
  i saw many people in another thread this week asking the usual `` what 's up with the french for god 's sake ?! '', 
  well , i mean , they work 15 hours a day and in the end they sell their productions of meat or milk for a few cents and the big supermarkets make huge profits . 
  would n't you be mad ? 
  the government asked ( yes asked ) the big supermarket chains to sell the meat at a more expensive price last month ( yes that 's right , they did n't ask them to lower their margin ) and nothing happened , of course . 
  there will be a meeting between the european ministers of agriculture on the 7th of september . 
  - ** paris marked the 20th anniversary of the rer b subway attack at station saint-michel . 
  ** in 1995 a bomb killed 8 people and injured 117 others . 
  the algerian organization gia was responsible . 
  - ** an 18-year-old french woman is in remission from hiv - despite not having taken any drugs against the virus for 12 years . 
  ** - ** the vincent lambert case is still not over . 
  ** vincent lambert is a tetraplegic man whose family is fighting over the decision to terminate his life or not . 
  his mother and father are firmly against it and have used very questionable ways to campaign for their son 's life , they are very religious and this aspect plays an important role in their battle . 
  vincent lambert 's wife and nephew ( mostly ) want him to die , they say that 's waht he wanted/wants/would have wanted ( he 's obviously no longer able to communicate , he 's been in a vegetative state for about 5 years , following a car accident ) . 
  the case went through all possible courts , including european ones , and vincent lambert is supposed to die . 
  but this week the doctor in charge of the final decision announced that she does n't feel all the circumstances are there to proceed ( basically there 's so much tension that the staff at the hospital fears there could be some danger if they decided to terminate his life , that 's what i understood ) . 
  really sad indeed . 
  - ** important fires in gironde . 
  ** - ** christopher froome won the tour de france . 
  ** - ** the writers of the satirical muppet show `` les guignols '' have been fired . 
  ** it 's a cult show that 's been airing for about 20 years . 
  a few weeks ago ( just after the death of the former program director who hired them ) , the new director of the channel ( who happens to be friends with sarkozy ) announced that `` les guignols '' would stop . 
  finally new authors will be hired , they got rid of the old ones . 
  the show will be visible online on dailymotion ( or on tv but only for canal plus suscribers ) . 
  other programs of canal plus have been changed , but nothing major . 
  haha , i think it took 3 good months in france . 
  good luck with the public debate if it turns out as ugly as it was in france 2 years ago . 
  it 's only a matter of time anyway : when is it supposed to be voted for good ? 
  ** france ** not much i think ? 
  the greek situation has ( understandably ) been at the center of the news all week and it 's the holidays so journalists do n't have many other things to report , except telling us it 's really hot . 
  - ** it 's getting hot in here ** . 
  high temperatures throughout the country , all week long . 
  - ** charles pasqua died : he was the french interior minister under chirac and then under balladur ** . 
  ( heart attack , at 88 ) . 
  good guy because : he joined the resistance during wwii at age 16 . 
  fervent gaullist , he was very attached to the soveignty of the state and people also liked the fact that he would not mince his words ( old style politician that becomes rare nowadays ) . 
  he also campaigned against the ratification of the maastricht treaty . 
  bad guy because : had a lot of corruption affairs behind him . 
  and was friends with a lot of right-wing corrupt politicians . 
  never really convicted ... as the interior minister , he also has a responsablity in police violence that resulted in the death of an innocent student who was just participating in peaceful protests . 
  - ** the cour de cassation grants surrogate children legal recognition . 
  ( surrogacy remains illegal in france ) . 
  ** i have n't followed this extremely closely , so this was about two particular cases and i 'm not sure this applies to all the other children ( precedent ) , but i think that 's it . 
  basically until then , babies born from surrogate mothers abroad ( where it 's legal , since it 's illegal in france ) were n't recognised , not legally tied to their parents . 
  now they will be : they wo n't suffer the consequences of an illegal act performed by their parents and thus will be able to lead a normal life , have french papers , etc. . . 
  but , again , the practice of surrogacy is still illegal in france and will likely remain illegal in the next 5 to 10 years . 
  complex issue , but i think most people agree with this decision : it 's for the good of the chilren , who are n't responsible for what their parents did . 
  ( as you know , when france was discussing gay marriage two years ago , maaany people protested ... well these people are still vocal and have turned their fight towards the issue of surrogacy . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with the gay marriage law , but they keep imagining that our government plans on legalizing this practise , although it 's been stated numerous times that that 's not the case at all . 
  so , even though the issue of the legal recognition of the children is probably understood and supported by the majority of the french population , the process has been delayed - because a vocal minority keeps saying it 's a way to force the acceptation of gpa ( surrogacy ) for homosexual couples . 
  it is not , it 's illegal , and will remain illegal . ), 
  - ** the cult satirical puppet show ` les guignols ' was rumored to be taken down . 
  ** but they are spared . 
  alain de greef , former canal plus ( tv channel which hosts the show since 27 years ) died this week . 
  two days later , the current chairman alledgedly decided to cancel `` les guignols '' . 
  the show is cult , it 's less popular today than it was in the 90s , but people are attached to it , and this news sparked outrage ( particularly in the context of this year 's attack against charlie hebdo ) .
