  but she never said what exactly . 
  some people watched it live when she jumped in front of a train and died . 
  some had tried to alert , but it was too late to intervene in real life . 
  - ** the cannes film festival opened ** . 
  and it started with a rape joke . 
  i 'm too lazy to write a lengthly text about this , so if you have n't heard and are interested , google it , but tl ; dr : actor laurent lafitte who was hosting the opening ceremony made a rape joke at woody allen ( that was clearly about roman polanski , possibly also about allen himself ) . 
  i thought it was quite brave to do that in cannes , france and on canal plus ( channel which finances a lot of fims ) . 
  the next day , lafitte did an interview in which he explained we all misunderstood the joke : in fact he was `` joking '' about the fact that filmmakers are coming to work in europe where they are n't the target of the american puritanism , he was not joking at them at all , he was taking their defense ... ( yeah , the new argument for people who do n't want to hear about sexual assault/harassment claims is to say `` oh , come on , enough with this americanization of our society , we do n't want to become puritan like the americans and take offense at any gritty joke ... aka `` enough with the sjws ! '' ) . 
  - ** rapper concert at the commemorations of verdun canceled after big controversy ** . 
  french rapper black m had been chosen to sing at a concert in front of 4,000 french and german students , following the commemorations of the battle of verdun . 
  this caused a big controversy and the mayor finally announced it is canceled . 
  problems are several : - black m is a very popular singer at the moment , but he does rap/pop music : why would you choose to commemorate such a tragic historic event that killed hundreds of thousands soldiers with a festive concert ?!, 
  - black m sells thousands if not millions of albums but his music is really really bad ( like , awfully bad , the music and the texts ) . 
  why would you choose such an `` artist '' who clearly is not a good role model , especially in a context like this one ? 
  ( it 's not just old conservative people who say this , everyone pretty much agrees , his lyrics are moronic and glorify dropping out of school and disrespecting authorithies , teachers ) . 
  - black m may be antisemitic . 
  in one of his songs , he uses a derogatory term to talk about jews . 
  but it has to be said that this song is a cover of another french rapper ( and no one raised an eyebrow at the time ) and actually the song celebrates diversity and fraternity . 
  so can he use the `` n-word '' equivalent for jews even if the song glorifies multiculturalism ? 
  - black m did a song in which he talked about france being a country of `` kouffars '' = nonbelievers . 
  the way i interpretated it , he was complaining about france 's colonianism and treatment of its immigrant citizens . 
  i personally do n't find it that shocking ( freedom of speech , i 'm not personally offended , i do n't take it for * me * ) but , as you can imagine , many people are really angry , and yes : is he a good choice for this context given this verse ? 
  - black m is a homophobe . 
  his career started in a band which was very popular too . 
  they stirred a controversy with a song in which they were rapping about violence against gays . 
  a journalist asked them questions on the subject : they said they indeed were homophobes and proud of it . 
  they then apologized but it clearly was n't sincere . 
  - many people protested against the concert using these arguments , but many actually used these arguments predominantly because they are racist and can not bear to see a young black man singing in verdun . 
  many contest this , claim no , they would have reacted exactly the same way for anyone with the same background . 
  this clearly is n't true : it would have caused a big controversy , but not as huge , and we would n't have seen so many racist insults if it had been a similar rapper , but a white one . 
  so it 's complicated : you want to call out black m on his homophobia , but being mixed with national front supporters pretending to suddenly be supporters of the gays and the jews feels wrong . 
  black m reacted to the cancellation with a facebook post in which he mentioned his grand-father who fought during wwii ( he was a colonial african soldier , something we do n't mention enough ) . 
  good thing he 's not singing there anymore . 
  but : it would be good if we could encourage everyone ( producers , radios , journalists , politicians , and people on social media and caf\u00e9s ) to treat the racists who attacked him the same way we called him out on his homophobia ( possible antisemitism and anti-france views ) . 
  - ** fomer interior minister brice hortefeux was driving at 60 km/hour over the speed limit , but was not fined . 
  he complained the custom officer was too aggressive . 
  ** he was driving at 170 km/h instead of 110 . 
  the custom officers mistook him for a `` go-fast '' drug smuggler !, 
  when they realized who he was they did not even charge him with anything . 
  and he had the guts to complain 1 of them was too aggressive towards him !, 
  he 's very conservative and a racist . 
  - ** yann barth\u00e8s , host of le petit journal ( equivalent to the daily show ) , announced he 's ending his show . 
  ** the presidential campaign is next year so that sucks . 
  the show is not as good as the american equivalents but it was honestly a good thing to have especially during major political events . 
  and i forgot one thing , but it 's not that important : - ** the rivalry between manuel valls ( prime minister ) and emmanuel macron ( minister of the economy ) becomes more and more visible . 
  ** it 's interesting given that the presidential primary and election are approaching : hollande wants to be the socialist candidate and is doing everything he can to counter all his opponents . 
  valls submitted himself to this , thinking he had no choice & this was the only thing he could do . 
  indeed almost everyone inside the party seems convinced hollande will be their candidate . 
  but it 's been months that french people all agree : we do n't want him again , we do n't want hollande to be the socialist candidate , he will have to eventually realize he needs to step aside and let someone else run if they want to gather enough votes to reach the second round of the presidential election . 
  now emmanuel macron , whose career exploded thanks to hollande , seems to have very high ambitions . 
  he 's young , good with the media , journalists have been writing about his potential for months . 
  it seems clearer and clearer to me that , indeed , he wants to run very soon ... 
  he launched his own political movement a few weeks ago , which did n't please hollande nor valls but they keep pretending nothing is wrong and they are all on the same page . 
  yeah , right ... 
  this week , valls talked to macron aggressively in front of the cameras in the national assembly . 
  it must be a coincidence but a ( trustworthy ) newspaper published an article saying macron has raised money in order to fund a campaign and is planning on announcing in june that he will be running for president . 
  surely this is just a coincidence , valls and hollande are n't mad , afraid ...  we 'll see how things go . 
  ** france ** : - ** the nuit debout movement is somewhat declining ** . 
  this is my personal opinion , judging by the images i watched on social media . 
  does it mean that people are becoming less interested ? 
  i 'm not so sure : politicians and institutions have started to be more openly critical of this social movement ( they were cautious during the first weeks ) so i would say it 's probable that a good portion of these protesters have left because they are tired/fed up/scared of the police response . 
  and/or after a month , it 's logical that some are feeling like things are stable and nothing really new is happening . 
  there still are many people every evening on republic square in paris . 
  - ** violence breaks out during the traditional may day protests ** . 
  this is n't really new , there always are `` gangs '' who come to these protests only to destroy things and fight the police . 
  but it seems that it 's been getting worse in the past few weeks/months : the police say they are the targets of more violent crowds while protesters ( normal , peaceful ones ) all seem to agree with the idea that there is a deliberate intention from the insitutions to see things degenerate ( the police is allegedly ordered to be more `` strict '' towards protesters , which fuels tensions , while at the same time they have allegedly been ordered not to target the problematic protesters ... so that violent ones can destroy while peaceful ones are somewhat encouraged to become angry at the policemen who are `` harrassing them ) . 
  as a result , the news reports about the annual may day protests focused on the violence ... instead of focusing on why people were protesting and how many people were in the streets . 
  - ** the police are going to protest against the `` anti-cops hate '' . 
  ** linked to the two previous points : since the attacks of last year , we 've heard soldiers and policemen complain about their aggravated working conditions ( more hours , more tension , more stress , they are feeling drained ) . 
  whereas in january of 2015 , people hugged and kissed their policemen , they are now feeling rejected by the population . 
  several hundreds policemen have been injured since the beginning of the year ( during social protests ) - many protesters have been injured too of course and there have been many arrests . 
  several videos showing policemen punching people ( on the ground/handcuffed ) have also emerged . 
  their unions announced a demonstration on the 18th of may , to protest against this `` anti-cops hate '' . 
  - ** the labour law reform bill is finally being discussed in the national assembly since tuesday ** . 
  the right is going to vote against it ( because they are on the opposition and always * have to * vote against anything that is presented by the government . 
  their serious argument is that the law is now not liberal enough , after being slightly modified following the social protests ) . 
  the national front , communists and parts of the greens are going to vote against it , because it 's too liberal . 
  most of the socialist mps are going to vote the law , but about 40 votes are allegedly missing . 
  the government is doing anything it can to pressure them but if that fails they , again , already threatened to use the `` 49-3 '' amendment : push the law even if it is n't democratically voted by the mps . 
  the debates are supposed to last 2 weeks in the national assembly , we 'll see how it goes . 
  - ** hollande stated that at this stage , france will not accept the ttip ** . 
  this is n't really new : the secretary of state in charge of the negociations was already saying this months ago . 
  i think they probably voiced their concerns because the new round of negociations was starting and the text leaked thanks to greenpeace . 
  france is especially worried about its agriculture : they absolutely want to see the european controlled designation of origin labels be preserved , whereas the americans do n't want to hear about it . 
  - ** the french are becoming less racist , even if racist acts have increased ** . 
  the annual `` tolerance index '' report states that , contrary to what could have been expected after the terrorist attacks and the political discourse that followed , the french are becoming more tolerant . 
  but it also shows that , indeed , racist acts have increased . 
  [ source in english ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/the-french-may-be-getting-less-racist-but-are-doing-more-racist-things ) . 
  - ** `` things are getting better '' in france , unemployment is finally decreasing . 
  ** hollande is starting his reelection campaign : in the past two weeks he and his government have been repeating ad-nauseam this motto `` things are improving '' . 
  people are not convinced , the message is not well received and the opposition is arguing that the positive economic figures we are seeing are partly caused by structural international reasons that have nothing to do with hollande 's policies and also partly due to people being erased of the unemployement statistics simply because they missed 1 appointment/worked for just a few hours during the month/were hired thanks to government aided `` fake '' jobs ... - ** primary teachers are going to see their revenue increase ** . 
  their wages had n't been increased in years . 
  many primary teachers are still doubtful : how much will it be ? 
  many people also say this is a calculated move just one year before the presidential election . 
  - ** controversy about big bosses salaries ** . 
  reoccurring theme , it happens every 3 months or so . 
  this time it about the boss of renault . 
  shareholders actually voted * against * it but the board of directors ignored it . 
  several other big bosses were pointed out , we talked about it during a day or two , same as usual ... - ** famous cartoonist sin\u00e9 died . 
  he worked at charlie hebdo for 27 years ** .
