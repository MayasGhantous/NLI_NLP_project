  this time it 's really the end of an era . 
  all of the big figures that emerged around may 68 have left . 
  i do n't know what other french people thought , but i was quite sad to see how the news was treated : i felt it really did n't gather lots of reactions , and the reports focused way too much on the `` controversial '' aspects of his career , instead of celebrating his legacy . 
  he died during a surgery , he had been ill for a while . 
  he was one the most popular french cartoonists , famous for his `` anarchist '' and anti-clerical views . 
  he was fired from charlie hebdo in 2008 following accusations of antisemitism because of a paper he did on sarkozy 's son . 
  he won the trial but that was too late : he created his own newspaper `` sin\u00e9 hebdo/sin \u00e9 mensuel '' , which was an alternative to charlie hebdo ( only better in my opinion ) . 
  - ** a french journalist infiltrated a jihadist cell for 6 months . 
  ** it was broadcasted this week and was pretty interesting . 
  the cell was `` dismantled '' last december ( maybe you remember hearing about a foiled attack against a military base ? ), 
  the cell was centered around a 20 year-old french guy ( of french and turkish parents , i do n't remember if he had dual citizenship or not ) . 
  they really were n't `` pros '' but it was clear that this individual was very determined and there was something clearly wrong and dangerous about him . 
  the journalist managed to ask him how he became radicalized : identity `` crisis '' ( he did n't feel french , nor turkish ) , psychological flaws ( he confessed that when he was 14 or 15 , he was influenced by a `` friend '' into some sort of satanic views . 
  he was actually ashamed , stating he could not believe he had been easily influenced into following these bullshit ideas ... ) he tried to join the army but was rejected ( we do n't know but they probably identified he had psychological flaws ) , and finally he became interested in religion : it happened online ... he mentioned that one video in particular made him `` switch '' ... ... . it was a video made by american evangelists !, 
  muslim integrists had only added a few sentences about islam but basically it was an american propaganda video by evangelists that led him to pursue his online radicalization . 
  pretty crazy . 
  he tried to go to syria but was stopped in turkey and sent back to france where he was placed under house arrest after some jail time . 
  ( his turkish dad was devastated : he went to the police as soon as he realized his son was radicalized , but his son managed to go to turkey just a few days later . 
  when he came back from prison , his son managed to fool him into believing he was on the right track again but he kept a close eye on him . 
  there really was n't much he could do , his son was over 18 and considered him an apostate ... ) the other young french members of the cell seemed way less endoctrinated than him ( but were , of course , dangerous as well ) : young , dumb , easily influenced lost individuals . 
  there was one older man whose identity was never revealed , and whom the journalist never met in person , who seemed to be managing the cell from syria . 
  - ** a `` jihadist expert '' has been fired by a television channel because of his former links with terrorists ** . 
  pros : he converted to islam and studied in a very conservative school in egypt where he met lots of radical individuals ( including one of the clain brothers who are now important figures inside the islamic state ) . 
  the channel knew some details about his past but did n't know he was still on the list of potential dangerous citizens ( fiche s ) . 
  an article was published on wednesday , revealing some of the things he said during an interview with the secret services ( he `` does n't agree with jihad anymore , because he thinks it 's not okay to send kids to death when they have n't properly studied the quran '' ) . 
  cons : his past was known , that 's what makes him one of the best actual experts ( there have been many articles criticizing the numerous so-called `` tv experts '' on radical islam and jihadists but who are actually total frauds ... ) . 
  he 's a conservative muslim and never tried to hide it , but he publicly announced his rejection of terrorism . 
  the channel is only firing him because they are afraid of a controversy . 
  - ** lots of comments about sadiq khan in the french media ** . 
  muslim mayor ?!, 
  wow are you sure ? 
  france : * first round of the presidential election in 2 weeks * . 
  ( 2nd round in 4 weeks ) . 
  - ** 2nd televised presidential debate ** . 
  - it was the first debate between all the candidates qualified for the 1st round ( 2 weeks ago , another debate featured only the 5 `` main '' candidates ) . 
  it was loooong : about 4 hours long . 
  - ** far-left candidate philippe poutou stole the show : his one-liners against fran\u00e7ois fillon ( les r\u00e9publicains ) and marine le pen ( national front ) were the most commented ** . 
  [ nyt article about it ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/europe/with-disrespect-mechanic-candidate-bursts-french-political-elites-bubble.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&amp;amp;_r=1 ) . 
  ( 5 years ago , he scored 1,15 % in the first round . 
  his performance this week boosted him : he 's now at around 2,5 % . 
  obviously the fact that social media celebrated his attacks against the corruption cases of two of the main candidates does n't mean voters will change their minds about their votes , but still , this debate will probably be remembered ) . 
  - all the other candidates were , in my opinion , true to themselves : no big surprise . 
  apparently the post-debate polls were pretty bad for le pen , but i 'm not sure how reliable these are ; like fillon she lost 1 % to 2 % in recent polls , we 'll see if the trend continues . 
  - the media coverage , by our omnipresent pundits , was cringe-worthy , although not surprising . 
  ( they criticized poutou , the way he presented himself and talked , saying he acted inapropriately and was rude . 
  they always do , but still , that was the most striking thing for me about this debate -- i 'm talking about how `` journalists '' and editorialists reacted after the debate ) . 
  - ** leftie jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon continues to rise in the polls : now 3rd , in front of fillon ? 
  ** for 3 weeks now , his campaign has been one of the main focus . 
  whereas he was the 5th man not that long ago , behind socialist candidate benoit hamon and les r\u00e9publicains candidate fran\u00e7ois fillon , he 's now 3rd in some polls ( at 18 % / 19 % - fillon 17 % / 18 % and hamon 9 % ) . 
  is this the best he can do ? 
  ( are the polls even legit ? ), 
  can he continue to grow and maybe reach the second round ? 
  ( some of his supporters from a discord team launched a video game : [ fiscal kombat ] ( http://fiscalkombat.fr/ ) . 
  you are m\u00e9lenchon and have to take money from famous rich - corrupt - french politicians in order to fund the budget of the country . 
  it 's pretty fun ) . 
  - ** benoit hamon is still struggling ** . 
  as i was saying , the socialist candidate is still at 9 % , now that m\u00e9lenchon is seen as the most viable candidate for the left . 
  will it stay that way or will his polls continue to decrease ? 
  it seems likely to me . 
  ( yesterday , hamon was interviewed on tv and , when asked for whom he would prefer to vote in the second round in case le pen is qualified , he answered m\u00e9lenchon . 
  `` well that 's normal , he 's closer to him than to macron '' you will say . 
  i agree , but this question is a classic and usually candidates refuse to answer it . 
  they always say that they will only give a name once the first round is over and the 2 final candidates are known . 
  so , in my opinion , that 's a ( not so subtle ) endorsement for m\u00e9lenchon . 
  it can only encourage the current trend that helps m\u00e9lenchon , and outcasts hamon ) . 
  - ** [ fillon floured ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oynkwvfqaw0 ) ** . 
  ... his poor expensive suit  ( it happened during one of his rallies and the guy who did it was shouting `` lobbyist ! '' ), 
  apart from that and the debate , nothing special for fillon this week . 
  he held big rally in paris and it was successful . 
  and he lost 1 % to 2 % in the polls and may now be behind m\u00e9lenchon but i already told you ; we 'll see if it 's confirmed or not in future polls . 
  ( another element for fillon is nicolas dupont-aignan 's score . 
  this `` small '' candidate is kind of a mix between les r\u00e9publicains and the national front . 
  5 years ago , he got 1,79 % . 
  this year , he could be an alternative for right-wing voters looking for a more respectable looking candidate . 
  polls put him at around 3 % to 4,5 % , he did quite well during the debate ) . 
  - ** le pen denied france 's responsability in the vel d'hiv round-up ** . 
  in 1942 , more than 13,000 jews were round-up at the vel d'hiv cycling track by the french police before being sent to death camps . 
  le pen said : `` i do n't think france is responsible for the vel d'hiv . 
  i think that generally speaking if there are people responsible , it 's those who were in power at the time . 
  it 's not france . '', 
  but , of course it wo n't matter to her supporters , nothing does . 
  and i 've seen many online comments , by people claiming to hate le pen , saying the articles reporting on this were `` click-bait '' . 
  ** nothing much this week i think ? 
  he was the last candidate to appear on one the main french political shows . 
  i personally thought his performance was bad and it furthermore desmontrated all his flaws . 
  but apparently most people thought he was very good . 
  so we 'll see if he regains the 1 or 2 points he allegedly lost recently . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ** social protests not over in french guiana ** . 
  people have been protesting against the lack of funding in this overseas territory . 
  the government sent two ministers and offered a 1 billon euros plan that was refused by the unionists representing the protesters . 
  the ministers left . 
  the protests are planned to carry on , but since the media coverage has moved on , not sure how it will end . 
  - ** a french soldier died in mali ** he 's the 19th french soldier to have died there since the beginning of the french intervention , if i remember correctly . 
  - ** a bishop was forced to quit , following paedophilia rumors ** . 
  i was commenting on a documentary about paedophilia in the catholic church last week . 
  well , for the first time the church acted quickly and firmly . 
  there had been rumors in the region for a few weeks about inappropriate things he allegedly said to kids and the way he touched them , no sexual assault was reported but for once they decided to act and the pope gave the okay . 
  good . 
  no , he has n't answered the question yet . 
  honestly i do n't know ... - macron is closer to his political line .
