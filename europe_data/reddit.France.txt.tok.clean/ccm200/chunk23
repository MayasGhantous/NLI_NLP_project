  ( but he betrayed him when he suddenly decided to quit and run for president - at a time when hollande was still planning on running for his reelection !, 
  macron was `` created '' by hollande , so that must have been hard to swallow : a young lad who climbed the political ladder thanks to you , first when you picked him as an adviser and then when you appointed him minister although he had never been elected anywhere . 
  but rumors say they are still in good terms - some journalists even claim hollande advises macron through text messages , idk whether that 's true or not but it sounds credible to me ) . 
  - backing hamon would sound more logical to me , just because hollande was the leader of the socialist party for years and supporting another candidate - for the first round - would really be unprecedented and create chaos , especially after valls ' statement . 
  ( but hollande also considers hamon a traitor , for criticizing his policies . 
  he fired him for that so i do n't think he has great respect for him . 
  plus if he intends to back hamon , why has n't he done it already ? ), 
  - in any case , hollande probably is n't going to be helping the candidate he decides to back , given his low approval rating . 
  so maybe he wo n't say anything before the first round and only back someone for the second round ? 
  ( i do n't know , on the one hand hollande is famous for having a hard time taking decisions and waiting until the last minute before doing so , on the other hand i have a hard time believing he wo n't take part and he 's also famous for being an avid political strategist ) . 
  - i just googled , to see if i missed anything , and apparently ( on the 10th of march ) he told a journalist he would answer `` later '' . 
  which i assume means he does intend to back one of the two before the first round ... ( he 's pretty much absent from the news , but no doubt journalists will start asking the question more and more often now that the end is near . 
  he 's someone who looooves `` teasing '' journalists , so i would n't be surprised if he decided to play with them in the next two weeks , giving subtle answers that can be interpretated both ways , before finally giving a clear answer ) . 
  another article says that hollande is focusing on fighting le pen ... which in my opinion hints at a probable support for macron rather than hamon - same reasoning as valls . 
  ( but again , if he does so , it wo n't help macron : hollande knows it , so maybe he 'll decide to remain silent ) . 
  tl ; dr : i really do n't know , 
  thanks , that was nicely explained . 
  unfortunately i ca n't find any . 
  france 24 english had a live stream on their youtube channel but apparently it 's no longer available as a replay . 
  france : * 21 days left before the first round of the presidential election * . 
  - ** valls betrays hamon and breaks his promise by backing macron . 
  ** former prime minister manuel valls , who competed against benoit hamon during the socialist primary and lost , just delivered the final blow against the candidate of his party by stating he would vote for centrist candidate emmanuel macron ( instead of benoit hamon ) . 
  ( after losing against benoit hamon in january , manuel valls went on holiday for 3 weeks . 
  when he came back , instead of either remaining silent or campaigning in favour of the socialist candidate , he orchestrated a campaign against hamon . 
  so it was already clear to everyone that he was siding with macron but that was n't enough : 3 weeks before the election , he had to publicly support him ! ), 
  valls had signed a paper promising he would support and campaign in favour of whoever won the primary . 
  but the socialist party wo n't sanction him . 
  emmanuel macron 's reaction was `` cold '' : he stated that he thanked manuel valls but that he wo n't necessarily be including him in his future government , since he wants to renew the french political landscape . 
  ( he said that after valls ' statement , but he had already said it the day before , which did n't make valls hesitate apparently ) . 
  - ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon is now 4rth ** . 
  - pretty logically , benoit hamon ( who already had trouble convincing voters in this context = no help from his `` friends '' ) is now polled around 10 % , whereas `` far-left '' candidate jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon is on the rise ( polled around 15 % ) . 
  it was the opposite until now . 
  - macron and le pen are stable ( both around 25 % ) . 
  as for fillon i 'm not too sure because i think i 've seen some polls recently saying he was on the rise again , but other polls say he 's losing points ( putting him between 18 % and 16 % ) ... so , how far behind him is m\u00e9lenchon ? 
  could he reach the 3rd place ? 
  hard to say . 
  - ** macron is trying to prove he 's not a hollande copycat ** . 
  many ( old ) politicians ( from all tendencies ) have backed emmanuel macron . 
  is it a blessing or a curse ? 
  - well , on the one hand , since he 's young and starting from scratch with a new political movement , he needed support to appear `` presidential '' and to convince people he could actually be able to form a government . 
  - but on the other hand , his campaign is based on the promise to offer new solutions and `` revolutionize '' things ( he published a book entitled `` revolution '' ... couch cough ) . 
  many of the politicians who have backed him are old , retired folks , which does n't really fit with this narrative . 
  plus , many are socialists , therefore his opponents ( fran\u00e7ois fillon and marine le pen mostly ) are attacking him , saying he 's `` emmanuel hollande '' and will in fact just carry on with the same political line as hollande and valls . 
  so macron is trying to find right-wing backers to balance things out ( although , some could argue - myself included - that in fact most of those who backed him are right-wing ) and he reached out to christian estrosi , a famous sarkozyst . 
  how will his supporters react ? 
  - in my opinion , it was n't a smart move : estrosi does n't have a good image and most people probably think macron should n't look for endorsements that way . 
  but maybe they 'll passively give him another pass ... 
  i 'm betting on this . 
  - ** penelope fillon was formally indicted ** . 
  as part of the `` penelope gate '' scandal . 
  it 's not a surprise : her husband was indicted already and she joined him after being interviewed by the judges in charge of the investigations . 
  - ** new elements were published about marine le pen 's judicial cases '' ** . 
  but that does n't matter , her supporters do n't care and it 's not being covered that much in the media . 
  - ** there will be a debate on tuesday , with all the candidates ( 11 ) ** . 
  the previous one ( with only the 5 main candidates ) was quite easy to follow although it lasted 3h30 . 
  this one is probably going to be challenging to watch , but , well , that 's the democratic thing to do . 
  ( it will be on cnews and bfmtv . 
  not sure where you can follow it from abroad and if it will be translated or not ) . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ** negociations are ongoing in french guiana , between the government and protesters ** . 
  guianans launched a general strike to protest against their conditions . 
  at first the government refused to listen to their queries , before finally sending two ministers . 
  the overseas territories minister apologized for not coming sooner and for the decades-long lack of funding in guiana , which is historic and was very much appreciated by the community . 
  they offered a 1 billion euros plan but it was judged unsufficient ( french guyana is estimated to be 27 years behind in terms of development , compared to the mainland ... the situation is similar in all of our overseas territories , but guiana is the worst ) . 
  - ** french banks declare 5,5 billions of profits in tax heavens ** . 
  ... ( according to an oxfam report , obviously french banks are n't the only ones to do it ) . 
  - ** a chinese man was killed by the police , leading to protests this week ** . 
  the police was apparently called because of shouting inside his apartment . 
  when they arrived , he was preparing fish with cissors and they claim he attacked them , injuring one police officer and prompting the others to open fire in self-defense . 
  the man 's children however claim that he did n't attack them and that they just killed him for no reason . 
  i do n't know whether the alledge injury has been proven by a doctor or not . 
  the chinese community organised protests all week long . 
  - ** an `` amber alert '' was launched to find a little boy , kidnapped by his father ** . 
  usually the kids are found ( alive ) very quickly each time this system is used . 
  but not this time : they are still looking for him . 
  ( the father escaped from prison in december - well `` escaped '' as in , he did n't come back after a permission - and he 's from the travellers community , so he has many family members to hide him ) . 
  ( [ link to the pictures ] ( http://img.20mn.fr/adk4134etw27gdi5culfwa/2048x1536-fit_petit-vicente-5-ans-demi-enleve-pere-pres-clermont-ferrand-29-mars-2017.jpg ) , in case he went to spain ... ? 
  he 's supposed to be in south-west france , but you never know ) . 
  yes , thanks , 
   a bishop from cluj said romania would not fail demographically if every young family had three children , one for the mother , one for the father and one for the country and the church . 
  how do you decide which is which ?? 
   ( i guess the one for the country has to be a boy )  our minister of labor , who 's one of the worst people in our government and who , for example , wants to double all salaries below the sum of 870 euro ( only for state employees and gradually until the end of her term ) , said imf should mind its own business . 
  to quote her , `` psd ( her party ) won the elections , not imf . '' . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  france : politics * ( 28 days left before the 1st round of the presidential election ) * . 
  - ** first presidential debate between the 5 leading candidates ** . 
  - nearly 10 million people watched it . 
  it was loooong ( 3h30 ) , but surprisingly not that hard to watch until the end ( for me at least ) . 
  - there was no big surprise , i do n't think it will affect things much . 
  from what i read online , m\u00e9lenchon was considered the `` winner '' by quite a lot of people , but 1 ) this sample is primarily based on young people ( although apparently the mainstream media polls gave similar results ) 2 ) that does n't mean people will actually want to vote for him ( they acknowledged he performed well compared to the others , which is not to say they were convinced ) . 
  - what i feel most people took away from each of the candidates was : macron : `` i agree '' ( many times throughout the debate , he began his reply by saying he agreed with what another candidate had just said ) . 
  le pen : `` we need to re-arm ourselves '' ( she used this lexical terminology many times . 
  it 's a change from the medical/plague one she often uses too . 
  she spent a lot more time than the others focusing on what is wrong today instead of detailing what she suggests we should do ) . 
  fillon : `` i made some mistakes but please vote for me because i 'm the only realistic option to reform the country '' . 
  ( also , we later learned that he received text messages during the debate , from his pr advisor . 
  i do n't think it really helped him ) . 
  hamon and m\u00e9lenchon : i ca n't think of a short phrase to sum up their performance . 
  i thought they were both good at explaining their plans and came up with good one-liners , but it seems most people thought hamon was a little transparent . 
  ( he had a big meeting the day before , during which he made a long speech , maybe that had an impact ) . 
  - there will be 2 other televised debates before the first round , this time with all ( 11 ) candidates .
