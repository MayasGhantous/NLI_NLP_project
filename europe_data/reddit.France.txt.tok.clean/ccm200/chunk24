  - ** interior minister bruno le roux had to resign ... because he too hired family members as parliamentary assistants ( his teenage daughters !, 
  ) ** - it was on the news for only 1 & 1/2 or 2 days , which is quite unprecedented in france , given our political culture . 
  the french equivalent to the us daily show broke out the story one evening , the next day he announced his resignation . 
  the lr party barely had time to pretend they were outraged  - so , when he was an mp , he hired his 2 daughters as parliamentary aissistants 24 times ( 2 weeks to 2 months contracts ) , they were paid between 1500 to 3000 euros per month if i remember well ( that 's 55,000 euros in total ) . 
  again , this is legal in france , but the issue is that , like with fillon ( in the `` penelope gate '' ) it seems some of these jobs were fake : one the 2 daughters was hired one summer although she was also working full time in belgium at the same period . 
  and the other thing is that he first hired them when they were 16 and 17 , so although they were only supposed to do basic secretarial work , it raises question about the idea of choosing unqualified people in parliament . 
  - an investigation was launched just a few hours after the story aired on tv . 
  end of the story . 
  see that 's easy !, 
  we should do it like that in the future , like in any normal country  - ** fillon accused hollande of orchestrating leaks against his political rivals ( = including him ) through a `` black cabinet '' ** . 
  he 's becoming insane , just like trump . 
  sad !, 
  - first , there were other revelations about fran\u00e7ois fillon this week : the main one is that he allegedly received 50,000 dollars in exchange of organizing a meeting between a lebanese billionaire friend , the ceo of total and putin . 
  ( and other minor revelations about other pricy gifts he received from his wealthy friends , this time a watch ) . 
  - so on thursday , as he was interviewed on tv , fillon claimed that hollande is using a `` black cabinet '' to spy on his political rivals and leak dirt on them when it 's the most convenient . 
  that would explain why the `` penelope gate '' scandal occurred . 
  ( he says a book that was just published proves it . 
  2 of its 3 authors are journalists at `` le canard encha\u00een\u00e9 '' , the newspaper that published the revelations about his wife and children , etc. 
  they immediately denied . 
  it 's honestly a bit complex to explain . 
  i 'll let other french redditors expand if they want . 
  hollande also denied almost immediately ) . 
  fillon just said he thinks he 's being wiretapped . 
  ( i 'm trying to keep up to date on the political circus over the atlantic and it 's already difficult , please do n't bring it over here ! ), 
  - ** marine le pen met with putin in moscow ** . 
  - ** defense minister le drian backs emmanuel macron ** . 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- other news : - ** there was a good tv documentary about paedophilia in the catholic church ** . 
  - i already forgot the details but basically we did n't actually learn much , they simply documented the fact that it 's wide spread and even institutionalized and that nothing is done about it , just pr . 
  - there 's a system to move child molesters to a different city when the victims start to talk ( like in spotlight ) , or even to a different continent : they showed a map , it 's insane ... but not surprising . 
  ( spanish speakers go to south america , french speakers go to former colonies in africa , english speakers go to australia ... ) - the pope tried to influence a trial when he still living in argentina . 
  this is factual , but the pope lied about it on camera . 
  no big deal . 
  ( we 'll think about this footage when a muslim institution is faced with similar accusations ... it will be funny cause the public outrage wo n't be the same , haha ) . 
  i think they said that half of the 11 top members of the catholic church have covered up child abuse cases ( not talked to the police/justice after being told about some victims ) . 
  but it 's okay , the pope is modern he has twitter !, 
  and they now have appointed people to address this issue !, 
  ( they do pretty much nothing apart from holding meetings and handing out leaflets ) . 
  and our politicians still have n't thought about creating parliamentary committee hearings either , but it 's normal . 
  - ** 3 french students were injured during the westminster attack ** . 
  - ** there are currently important social protests in french guiana ** . 
  they have a strike planned , starting tomorrow . 
  they are protesting about health , education , housing , security issues . 
  ** france ** : - ** school shooting in grasse : several hurt ** . 
  3 students and the headmaster were shot and slightly injured , several others were hurt in the chaos that ensued . 
  the suspect , 16 years old killian , acknowledged the facts and said he was disappointed he did n't cause more damage . 
  he said he had a list ( in his head ) of ( between 8 and 14 , apparently he 's not clear ) students he wanted to kill . 
  he claims he acted because he wanted to take revenge on those students who were mean to him ( he does n't use the terms bullying or harrassment and the investigations do n't corroborate his allegations . 
  it seems he was the one causing trouble and annoying other students ) . 
  he apparently could n't find his targets , entered the wrong classroom . 
  i do n't think we know if he picked the 3 students randomly or if he knew them . 
  the headmaster intervened and got shot in the arm . 
  another student and friend of the suspect was arrested and seems to have helped him . 
  the weapons belonged to the suspect 's father and grandfather . 
  the suspect 's social network pages revealed he had a passion for weapons and was fascinated by school shootings ( columbine notably ) . 
  his youtube profile quote was : `` the one who will leave his mark on history with your blood '' . 
  he recently uploaded a video on facebook , posing with a clown mask and a gas mask , and a gun he pointed towards the camera and to his head . 
  he also `` liked '' and shared racist and sexist content and he played `` hatred '' ( which is apparently one of the most violent video games on the market and is very well liked by `` gamergaters '' ) . 
  his father is a municipal councillor ( got elected in 2014 under the national front banner , since then he joined the les r\u00e9publicains mayor team , and he is also part of the rpf party , which is kinda between the two , but more far-right than right ) . 
  the dad tweeted about the event before knowing his son was the shooter ( normal tweet , condemning the attack and sending thoughts to the victims ) . 
  - ** a man was shot dead in orly airport . 
  ** not clear if terrorism or not . 
  it is treated as a potetial terrorist attack , but things are n't clear at this stage . 
  shortly before 7am on saturday , a man shot a police officer with a non-lethal gun ( i think it 's the same kind of gun used in the school shooting actually , except the high schooler had other weapons too ) during a normal identity check near where he lived . 
  he then went to a local bar and threatened people with his gun . 
  before or after that , he texted his dad : `` i made a mistake , i shot some policemen . 
  turn on the tv , you 'll hear about it . '', 
  his father and brother went to the police . 
  he then stole a car and went to orly airport , where he attacked a soldier , trying to take her famas , allegedly shouting `` i 'm here to die for allah , anyway there are going to be deaths '' , before being shot by her 2 collegues . 
  the autopsy revealed he had traces and alcohol and drugs in his blood . 
  he had a quran with him . 
  the man , 39 year-old french citizen ziyed ben belgacem , was known to the police for several violent thefts and robbery ( for which he had been judged and condemned ) . 
  following suspicions about a potential religious radicalization while he was in prison in 2012 , he was investigated in 2015 , but it showed nothing and thus he was not added to the record of potential radical individuals ( fiche s ) . 
  his family and neighbours describe him as a loner with psychological weaknesses , who was not an active muslim but rather a drug addict ( cannabis , cocaine ) . 
  so , it seems to me things escalated because he got paranoid and panicked ( potentially because he was drunk and/or high ) . 
  it does n't look like a premeditated attack . 
  - ** in the midst of this , the renewal of the state of emergency is back on the news ** . 
  it has already been renewed several times since the november attacks of 2015 . 
  it is due to last until the 15th of july , the next president wil have the responsability to decide whether to renew it again or not ... --------------------------------------------------------------------------- politics : * 35 days remaining before the first round of the presidential election . 
  * - ** the definitive list of presidential candidates is now official : 11 candidates are qualified ** . 
  the 5 main you know about : le pen , macron , fillon , hamon , m\u00e9lechon . 
  plus 6 other , smaller candidates : poutou , arthaud , lassalle , cheminade , dupont-aignan , asselineau . 
  - ** marine le pen 's national front made it into the news several times this week ** . 
  - marine le pen and her father jean-marie are suspected of having underestimated the value of their estates . 
  it is yet another judicial case for her . 
  the number is adding up  but her supporters do n't care . 
  - two journalists published a book about all the various recent cases targeting the national front party . 
  - two tv documentaries were aired this week : one explaining some of these cases . 
  and one that focused on the `` behind the scenes '' of a local national front branch : a member was excluded from the party because of revisionist statements ( he was filmed saying he did not believe 6 million people were killed during the holocaust ) . 
  - ** fran\u00e7ois fillon was indicted for the penelope gate scandal . 
  ** - a young man who went to one of his rallies pressed charges because he says he got beaten for not standing up during the marseillaise ... - we learned the identity of fillon 's rich friend , the one who bought him expensive berluti suits . 
  he 's a lawyer and businessman who had close links with chirac , de villepin and sarkozy because he 's close to many african leaders ( as part of the neo-colonialist fran\u00e7afrique `` tradition '' ) . 
  - ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon held a massive rally in paris on saturday : 130,000 people showed up ** . 
  the `` far-left '' candidate organized a march between bastille and r\u00e9publique , before giving a speech . 
  it was centered around one of his main proposals : the 6th republic ( reforming the current institutions ) . 
  he also talked about his main other campaign talking points . 
  - ** benoit hamon held a big rally yesteday , but he 's still not being helped by his socialist `` friends '' : manuel valls did n't sponsor him . 
  ** - about 20,000 people showed up to his rally . 
  it was successful . 
  - manuel valls ( former pm , who lost the primary ) did n't sponsor the candidate who was designated by the socialist voters , alleging hamon is sectarian . 
  only one minister is campaigning for hamon .
