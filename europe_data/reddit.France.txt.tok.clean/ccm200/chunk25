  most of the other top members of the party are either refusing to campaign , or even criticizing him openly in the media ( they favour macron but only a minority said it openly , most of them are waiting ) . 
  - ** emmanuel macron is having minor difficulties because of 2 cases ** - an investigation was launched for suspicion of favouritism because of an event he went to , in las vegas in 2016 , when he was still minister of the economy . 
  the problem is that there was no tender process in appointing the company organizing this ( expensive ) event . 
  but macron is not directly implicated/involved . 
  - there are suspicions about macron 's declaration of assets : he declared his income ( before taxes ) were 3,3 millions euros for the 2009-2014 period ( first as a banker at rothschild 's , then as hollande 's secretary ) ; he also declared his assets ( in 2014 ) were worth 1,2 million and he had a debt of 1 million ... which means only 200,000 worth of assets . 
  some people are thus wondering how he ended up with such low savings and an anticorruption association asked for an investigation . 
  macron says since he had a self-employed status when he was woring as a banker , he had to pay lots of taxes , to the point where he did n't earn enough ( once he got hired by hollande ) to pay his taxes ( that were still indexed on his former salaries . 
  so it 's a bit complex and i honestly could n't say who is right . 
  i should mention this is circulating a lot online and it 's not pleasing macron 's team , which i can understand since we 're sometimes not far from conspiracy theory nuts , but at the same time given how complex and far from john doe 's reality it is , it 's normal that people are suspicious and feel that the media is `` hiding '' something . 
  - macron met with merkel . 
  - ** first tv debate between the 5 main candidates tomorrow ** . 
  i wonder who will manage to convince viewers the most . 
  especially macron , who is a beginner and who has managed to avoid going on tv a lot until now ( he 's now finally doing all the big tv interviews . 
  he was on the news yesterday evening and i found him ... bad . 
  maybe that 's because i do n't like him , but he seemed to get overly defensive for no reason . ), 
  there was a tv documentary yesterday in which 4 candidates were being interviewed by children in a classroom . 
  ( the main candidates except marine le pen , who declined ) . 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- other news : - ** a woman was slightly injured by a parcel loaded with explosives that was posted to the imf offices in paris ** . 
  apparently sended by a greek anarchist group . 
  - ** renault is suspected of having tampered with emission tests for its diesel cars ** . 
  in the same way volkswagen did , and for decades . 
  - a young woman with down syndrome presented the weather on tv , after a facebook campaign launched to help her fulfill her dream . 
  lots of articles about this . 
  yeah , well , i do n't like stuff like that , plus i have n't checked how genuine the campaign was , but i could n't help but think it seemed to have been organized by a communication agency ( maybe i 'm wrong ) . 
  - catherine deneuve defended roman polanski she was asked about what she thought of the fact that after being appointed president of the last cesar ceremony he decided to decline because of the criticism that followed . 
  deneuve said something along the lines of `` that was decades ago , it 's mean to keep attacking him for that , the victim did n't look like she was 13 , she could have been 16 , and it 's her mother who had brought her there . 
  i 've always found the term rape excessive '' ... :( so disappointing . 
  ** france ** : politics : * 40 days remaining before the 1rst round of the presidential election ( 54 days before the 2nd round ) * . 
  * as of today , there are 7 candidates ( they have until next thursday to gather enough sponsors to be able to compete . 
  7 already did , 1 other is confident his number of sponsors will reach the requirements , and 2 or 3 others may be able to reach the target . 
  so that means 8 to 11 candidates in total , we shall see ... anyway there are 5 main candidates , all the others are polled around 1 % ) * . 
  - ** fillon is back in the game , but his campaign is still tarnished ** . 
  - finally , after more than 6 weeks , it seems the `` penelope gate '' season is over . 
  the finale was on monday : fran\u00e7ois fillon was unanimously backed by the key figures of the les republicains party , and alain jupp\u00e9 ( the hypothetical substitute candidate/plan b ) refused to challenge fillon ( he appeared on tv to basically say `` fuck that shit , i 'm out '' ) . 
  season 2 is on : - fillon lied several times this week : about the number of people attending the demonstration in his favor last sunday in paris : he claimed they were 200 000 , while the real figure is probably 40 000 . about the fact that tv channels announced the suicide of his wife : it never happened ( he probably got mixed up between `` suicide de sa campagne '' & `` suicide de sa compagne '' : `` campaign '' vs `` companion/wife '' ) . 
  probable other fake news when during a rally he talked about a `` popular game '' he heard about when he was pm , around 2012 . 
  a `` game '' consisting of throwing razor blades in the legs of girls wearing short skirts : nobody had heard about it ... surprisingly . 
  - [ the lr party tweeted an antisemitic caricature of emmanuel macron ] ( http://cdn-lejdd.ladmedia.fr/var/lejdd/storage/images/media/images/tweet-des-republicains/13314686-1-fre-fr/tweet-des-republicains.jpg ) . 
  they were immediately called out on twitter and replaced the drawing with a real picture of macron . 
  fillon apologized more than 1 day later . 
  ( this is not an accident : their supporters have been insulting journalists in lr rallies for years now , it only got worse during the campaign . 
  a few weeks ago for instance there was a scene that got around : a fillon supporter told a journalist he was = to nazis ... ) - fillon was gifted 48500 euros worth of costumes since 2012 by ( an/several ? ), 
  anonymous rich friend ( s ) . 
  last month , while he was in the middle of the penelope gate scandal , he received 2 costumes costing 7,500 euros each . 
  this is not illegal , but hey . 
  - he also received a 50 000 euros loan by his millionaire friend ( the one who hired his wife and paid her 500 000 euros for writing 3 tiny book reviews ) . 
  he was supposed to declare the loan but did n't . 
  ( he paid him back : so that 's okay ... ) - in a documentary on tv about parliamentaries ' work , we saw fillon signing the attendance sheet before ... quickly leaving the assembly . 
  it 's nothing new , we had already seen this and it 's public knowledge ( for anyone willing to know , i mean ) that fillon has one of the worst attendance ratings amongst mps . 
  i 'm detailing all this although that 's really not worth sharing , but it 's `` funny '' and it shows that we 're still talking about him instead of focusing on the real issues of the campaign . 
  and anyway , after these 6 weeks , he is still polled at 19 % / 20 % . 
  - ** other candidates : same old same old ** . 
  i do n't think anything special happened to any of the other presidential candidates this week . 
  other news : - ** a rhino was killed by poachers in a zoo near paris ** . 
  they shot him and cut off its horn . 
  he was only 4 years-old . 
  there are only about 20 , 000 white rhinos left in the world . 
  - ** missing family in brittany : the brother in law confessed . 
  ** he killed his wife 's brother 's family because of a feud about gold pieces : the grandfather allegedly found a treasure in a flat he was renovating ( banque de france gold pieces and gold bars , that were supposedly stolen during wwii ) . 
  after the grandfather died , his son allegedly stole the whole thing , without sharing with his sister . 
  hence a family feud that found its tragic end when the sister 's husband killed the whole family . 
  pretty stupid , the police found dna evidence leading to him , of course . 
  ( the 21 year-old son - who was killed - was initially suspected and there were articles pointing to him because of tweets he had written when he was just a depressed teen ) . 
  ( a medium interviewed on tv at the beginning was ... wrong - surprise !, 
  she had had a vision about a young male ( so ... the son , too ) killing the whole family near the sea . 
  tell that to fillon  i was simply quoting him . 
  he 's the one who said he had been `` politically assassinated '' and we 're in a `` quasi civil war '' . 
  of course that 's bullshit . 
  yesterday he also claimed news tv channel announced the suicide of his wife on wednesday . 
  that 's totally false . 
  the main thing that makes it tricky is that parliamentary assistants ' jobs are a grey area in france . 
  in the uk , you had a reform following similar scandals in 2009 ( i remember : i was living in the uk at the time . 
  i distinctly remember one mp making the news for porn bought on public funds ... it went on for weeks and weeks with several people having to resign and apologize . 
  apparently your mps now have to write down their professional expenses in detail . 
  it 's not like that in france , at all ) . 
  mps are given a sum of money to hire aides and they are free to use it as they please . 
  they can hire family members , it 's allowed in france , about 15 % of mps do ( it will probably change soon , given the repercussions of this scandal , but for now it 's legal ) . 
  therefore , fillon 's defense is to say that he 's totally innocent since it 's not against the law , even if he now admits what he did was morally wrong , but he only realised it in 2013 when he understood citizens had `` changed their minds '' on the issue and were now more critical of this system . 
  ( actually , he likely suddenly `` realized '' it in 2013 ... because another scandal forced him to `` realize '' : j\u00e9r\u00f4me cahuzac , our budget minister , was caught for tax evasion , which led to hollande passing a law for more transparency : all mps now have to reveal how much they earn ) . 
  basically : `` i did what so many other french mps did , for years and years , why am i suddenly being accused now , 3 months before the presidential election when i 'm predicted to win easily ? 
  you ca n't prove i did anything wrong because there is no rule that describes what a parliamentary assistant job entails . '', 
  so fillon and his wife claim that she did work for him , even though they apparently did n't provide any evidence of that , and did n't feel they should even have to prove it . 
  other parliamentary assistants and mps said they could easily prove the veracity of the work they are doing ( they can quickly find professional emails , show the badge they have to enter the national assembly , prove that they have an office in their mp 's constituency where they have lots of files proving they are actually working , show their diaries , have people testify that they met with them many times , etc. . . ) penelope fillon says her job consisted of reading the local newspapers and write memos for her husband , go to local events to represent him , discuss with citizens and inform him about what they were saying ... that kind of stuff . 
  and she was paid 7000 euros per month for that , working from home , with no professional email adress , no office . 
  but that ai n't against the rules : there are no rules !, 
  but the vast majority of the people who worked with fillon , or who knew his wife penelope , testified that they always thought she was a housewife . 
  she even said several times that she never interfered in her husband 's job : in one itw for the sunday telegraph in 2007 , she was quoted , on video , saying `` i 've never been his assistant or anything like that . 
  i do n't deal with pr either . '', 
  pretty daming ... and he also hired two of his kids , who were only law students at the time and whose curriculum apparently did n't have anything to do with the parliamentary work they were supposed to be working on . 
  it seems one of the two worked on fillon 's book : that 's campaign work , they are not supposed to be paid on public funds to do that , obviously . 
  yet another of his assistants was working for his campaign just weeks ago although she was ( / still is ? ), 
  listed as a parliamentary aide . 
  and there is another parliamentary assistant who only recently came to the surface : he 's a writer and was apparently hired as an assistant in 2013 when in fact he was writing fillon 's latest book ( yeah , in france major politicians write books all the time to launch their campaigns ) . 
  finally , just today , fillon 's former campaign manager said on the radio : `` fillon is the victim of a system that was put in place years ago , which consists in paying or in giving additional income to mps , through the wages of their aides . '', 
  he just basically admitted it : she was hired to pay her husband , everyone considered it was normal , the system is like that . 
  and we do n't have all the details of the investigations !, 
  maybe they found even more damning stuff !, 
  you 're welcome . 
  i really do n't know . 
  many french people are critical of the current eu .
