  the only candidate who is totally pro-eu is emmanuel macron ( fran\u00e7ois fillon is also pro status quo , but i do n't think that 's the case for many of his supporters , they are rooting for him for other reasons ) . 
  so it means the vast majority of french electors want to see things change in that regard . 
  they already voted `` no '' in the 2005 referendum about the new european constitution , but their vote was then ignored , creating even more frustruation . 
  but would they vote for frexit if it 's marine le pen who asks them to do so ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  referendums are so tricky , very often people use them to say `` no '' to their current government , instead of really answering the question . 
  a marine le pen victory would be a shock , even though we saw it coming . 
  the political debate would obviously change quite radically and the campaign about a frexit would be really intense . 
  i do n't know really . 
  on paper , i do n't see far left people critical of the current eu voting to leave on le pen 's conditions . 
  same for left-wing people . 
  many right-wing folks are also critical of the way the eu is working currently , but i think these people would favour the status quo . 
  but still , i think it would be quite unpredictable . 
   i do my best , but i have trouble summing things up !, 
  this week it was particularly challenging . 
  hopefully the bold characters are helping and you do n't need to read it all if you ca n't be bothered . 
  other news : - ** a security officer accidentally opened fire during hollande 's speech , injuring two people ** . 
  hollande was giving a speech for the opening of a new railway line . 
  apparently the guy stumbled and accidentally opened fire on the crowd below him . 
  two people were shot in the leg : it 's not serious but it could have been . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovjyswh75gu ) . 
  since , once again , fillon was dominating the news , we did n't talk about it that much . 
  ( i 'm personally worried : i 'm scared one of the presidential candidates will be attacked in the future final weeks before the election . 
  they have to campaign , it 's hard to properly protect them all , all the time . 
  it would be quite easy for a terrorist to attack them . 
  that would be the last straw , things are already at a low point . 
  hopefully i 'm wrong ) . 
  - ** investigations about a missing family ongoing ** . 
  a family of four disappeared in brittany 2 weeks ago . 
  blood was found inside their house , personal items were retrived hundreds of kilometers away and the son 's car was found in yet another town in brittany . 
  today , the father 's sister and her ex ( the sister 's ex ) are being interrogated . 
  apparently this former brother in law originally claimed he had had no contact with them in years ; well dna evidence was found in the missing son 's car . 
  maybe 4 murders motivated by the heritage then . 
  the bodies are still to be found . 
  ** france ** : * sorry it 's so long , once again * . 
  - ** we 're in a civil war , one of the main presidential candidates has been assassinated ** . 
  * oops , sorry : that 's alternative facts , from fran\u00e7ois fillon . 
  * - ** fran\u00e7ois fillon continues his campaign , despite indictment ** . 
  * it 's very long to explain , bear with me : * - ** over 5 weeks ago , newspaper le canard encha\u00een\u00e9 broke the `` penelope gate '' scandal ** , revealing that right-wing candidate fran\u00e7ois fillon ( who won the lr primary back in november ) hired his wife and 2 of his children as parliamentary assistants . 
  an investigation was launched because it seems that they did n't actually work . 
  fillon is thus suspected of having misused 1 million euros of public funds . 
  ( there is more to the story , but that 's roughly it ) . 
  - ** fillon denied the allegations but promised he would quit the race if he was indicted ** ( repeating what he had already said during the primary campaign , when he was attacking one of his opponents , nicolas sarkozy ) . 
  - on wednesday morning , fillon was supposed to visit the annual international agriculture show ( where all politicians traditionally go and spend hours , particularly when an election is near ) . 
  he did n't show up and issued a press release announcing his visit was postponed , to the surprise of several of his close advisors who were already there waiting for him . 
  he then announced a press statement at noon . 
  for 4 hours , it was media frenzy : contradictory rumors spread , would he finally announce he was quitting and designating his frontrunner alain jupp\u00e9 to replace him ? 
  someone else ? 
  or was he meeting with all the main lr politicians who were split about what to do ? 
  - he finally showed up 30 minutes late and revealed that he had received a convening letter by the 3 judges in charge of the case . 
  which means ** he will very likely be formally indicted on the 15th of march ** ( ... 2 days before the deadline for presidential candidates to register for the race ) . 
  ** but he announced he `` would not give up , he would not surrender , he would not withdraw '' ** . 
  - he went on with his day , having lunch in front of the cameras ( teasing the press ) before going to the agricultural show where he spent 4 hours , avoiding direct contact with the press and with `` real people '' as much as possible , amongst a real hysteria made of hundreds of journalists , supporters and protesters . 
  ** he announced a rally on sunday , billed as a protest `` against the coup d'\u00e9tat by the judges '' ** and against the press ( yes , you read that correctly . 
  and yes , the media are still calling him a `` right-wing republican '' despite this clearly far-right rhetoric ) . 
  the demonstration was later ( 3 days after ? ), 
  renamed as a rally in support of the candidate . 
  - on wednesday and friday , ** the first sponsorships for the presidential candidates were published : fillon gathered the most support , with already over 1100 signatures from elected politicians , exceeding the 500 required ** . 
  ( i do n't know how it works elsewhere but in france , in order to avoid having too many - fanciful - presidential candidates , they have to collect 500 signatures from elected people - mps , mayors , etc. . . 
  they have to send them between march the 1rst - wednesday - and the 17th ... 
  which means there are only 2 weeks left before the official list of presidential candidates is published ) . 
  - ** on friday , many of his allies finally started dropping him ** . 
  they were only a handful until then ; well every hour , 10 more names were added . 
  the number is now at 259 . 
  but fillon had a rally and he kept going . 
  - ** today the infamous rally ~ ~ `` against the coup d'\u00e9tat by the judges '' ~ ~ `` in support of fillon '' occurred in paris ** . 
  originally , his staff said they were counting on 120 000 supporters . 
  then they talked about 80 000 for it to be considered a success , and then 45 000 . 
  i do n't know how many there were . 
  it 's always difficult to know , it varies greatly depending on the sources . 
  but honestly there were quite a lot of people , especially since the weather was awful and they only had 4 days to organize . 
  fillon claimed they were 200 000 , the police says 40 000 . 
  - ** fillon is going to talk on tv tonight at 8 ** . 
  the journalist will probably ask him to clearly state whether he intends to run or not . 
  ( in his speech this afternoon , it seemed he still had n't changed his mind ) . 
  edit : he 's still running . 
  alain jupp\u00e9 just tweeted : `` i will give a press statement tomorrow at 10:30 am '' . 
  i personally think he 'll announce he wo n't run against fillon , otherwise he would have waited until the evening ) . 
  - ** tomorrow evening , the top lr party officials are meeting ** , fillon said he would attend . 
  on tuesday , the list of sponsorship signatures will be updated , we 'll see whether fillon gathers even more support or if jupp\u00e9 or another lr alternative receives any ( so far only jupp\u00e9 received 1 signature ) . 
  - ** what is going to happen ??? 
  - i do n't know !!!, 
  ** ** from a legal viewpoint , nothing can force fillon to quit the race ** : he won the primary and he already received the 500 signatures required to be an elligible presidential candidate . 
  plus , all the money gathered during and after the primary - about 8 million i think - went to fillon 's party ( ... massive fuck up by the lr party here ) . 
  ( the people who signed for him can not change their minds and support another lr candidate . 
  several did change their minds : their sponsorship was added on wednesday/friday and they openly distanciated themselves with fillon on friday-today . 
  but that does n't cancel their signature , they ca n't change it ) . 
  they would ( realistically ) be able to find enough people to sponsor this hypothetical other candidate in the 2 weeks remaining ( they clealy have enough elected politicians , we 're talking thousands ) . 
  money would be problem , it 's probably one of the issues they are discussing , but probably not the n \u00b0 1 . 
  ** maybe we 'll end up with 2 lr candidates ... ** i really ca n't tell . 
  the public debate has been focused on fillon for over 5 weeks now !!!, 
  hopefully , this will all eventually stop in 2 or 3 days and we 'll move on and start talking about the substance of the campaign . 
  -------------------------------------------------------- - ** marine le pen refuses to meet with judges , threatens state employees ** . 
  marine le pen is also in trouble with the justice in several cases , but since fillon is dominating the news , we are barely talking about it . 
  and anyway her supporters do n't care , they see it as evidence that the `` system '' is after her , trying to rig the election . 
  - there 's the story of the pictures she published on twitter back in 2015 , after a journalist made a comparison between her rhetoric and isis ' . 
  she responded by tweeting pictures of journalists decapited by isis , which lead to her being investigated for dissemination of violent images . 
  the european parliament voted to lift her immunity in this case this week . 
  imo , it 's only helping her , bigly . 
  - there 's also the case about her parliamentary assistants , whom she allegedly hired for fictitious jobs : officially working as aides in the european parliament while they were actually working for the party in paris ( or as her bodyguard ) .
