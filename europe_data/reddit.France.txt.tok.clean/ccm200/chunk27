  she refused to meet with the judges who summoned her , citing her parliamentary immunity as a defense . 
  ( it 's true : she can legally refuse to go , even if it 's morally and ethically questionable ) . 
  - this week she quite openly threatened state employees ( policemen , judges ) :  `` i want to tell public sector workers who are asked by a desperate political staff to use the powers of the state to keep tabs on opponents , to organise persecution , low blows and state cabals against them , to keep out of participating in such excesses . 
  in a few weeks , this government will have been swept away by the election . 
  but these civil servants will have to take responsibility for these illegal methods , because they are illegal and are putting their own responsibility at stake . '', 
  there are other cases against her : an investigation about the financing of her party for instance . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------ - ** emmanuel macron finally revealed his program . 
  and he got hit by an egg ** . 
  - finally !, 
  macron - who is still apparently leading in the polls ( we 'll see , things are so hectic right now that we 'll need to wait for things to stabilize a little bit ) - revealed what his `` project '' is all about . 
  i read the articles but there was not much to see imo ... 
  the full thing is going to be available shortly ( or already is by now ) . 
  i do n't care , i do n't like the guy , ask someone else . 
  - he also visited the annual agricultural show in paris and [ a protester hit him with an egg ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjalgdone9c )  ( ah , typical ! ), 
  -------------------------------------------------------------- - ** as was expected , there will be no alliance between left-wing candidate benoit hamon and far-left candidate jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon ** . 
  since hamon 's victory in the socialist primary back in january , there were calls for the two of them to form an alliance and for one of them to quit in favour of the other . 
  but it was quite clear from the start that their disagreements were too wide for it to happen . 
  this week , the two finally put an end to this theatrical suspense : they will both remain candidates . 
  also , several socialists close to manuel valls ( former pm , who lost the primary against hamon ) made their come back in the media this week , to criticize the candidate designated by their supporters . 
  all these people are clearly not willing to campaign for benoit hamon . 
  it 's hardly a secret : they are betting on a macron victory . 
  for now the vast majority are still part of the socialist party , but no doubt that they will announce their conversion to macron 's movement for the parliamentary elections in june , as soon as he wins . 
  bunch of lying cowards . 
  ( will the party split off ? ), 
  ( edit : grammar + fillon 's statement tonight & jupp\u00e9 's tweet ) . 
  just downvote and ignore , 
  ** france ** : politics - ** fran\u00e7ois fillon is still running despite the opening of a judicial investigation ** . 
  nothing `` new '' really . 
  apparently this means that 3 judges are going to carry on investigating ( following the previous judge , from a different prosecution , who opened the case ) but there very likely wo n't be an indictment before the election . 
  ( and if fillon is elected , he will benefit from the judicial impunity for 5 years ) . 
  anyway , he changed his line of defense to say that even if he is indicted , he wo n't drop his candidacy ( he said the opposite last month ) . 
  so same as the previous 5 weeks or so : fillon is having trouble campaigning ( he 's met by protesters ) but most of his supporters are still with him according to the polls , he 's not far behind le pen and macron . 
  the public debate is over the fillon scandal . 
  - ** there was a search at the national front headquarters and marine le pen refused to attend a judicial summons ** . 
  similar to fillon : nothing new . 
  her supporters do n't care . 
  media do n't cover it that much . 
  - ** leader of center party ( modem ) fran\u00e7ois bayrou forms an alliance with macron ** . 
  bayrou waited until the last `` minute '' before announcing whether he would be running for president this year ( for a 4rth time ) . 
  finally , he decided not to , instead he suggested forming an alliance with emmanuel macron , who agreed to it . 
  in 2012 , fran\u00e7ois bayrou gathered 9 % of the voted and the polls had him around 5,5 % for this year . 
  we 'll see how people react to the news in future polls , but apparently it 's positive for macron . 
  which is `` strange '' because bayrou * strongly * criticised macron only a few months ago ... ( saying he 's the candidate of big financial interests ) . 
  bayrou justified his sudden reversal by saying that this election is so important that it deserves making a sacrifice . 
  he allegedly did n't ask for a pm position , nor for `` arrangements '' for his party during the parliamentary elections . 
  his main requirement was that a reform about ethics and transparency in politics be included in macron 's program . 
  - ** leader of the greens yannick jadot drops in favour of benoit hamon . 
  ( discussions are officially still ongoing for an hypothetical alliance with `` far laft '' candidate jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon ) . 
  ** - yannick jadot was only polled at around 1 % so this does n't change things that much , but the left needs any help it can get to reach the second round . 
  - as for m\u00e9lenchon , things are complicated . 
  it 's theater : each camp pretends to be open to an alliance but it honestly seems unlikely . 
  i 'm pro-m\u00e9lenchon - so interpret what i say as you want : m\u00e9lenchon has been open about what he does from the beginning ( when hamon won the socialist primary ) : he always claimed to be up for a meeting with hamon , to discuss the terms of a possible alliance . 
  he reiterated several times . 
  on the contrary , hamon did n't answer his letter , it 's only when journalists bring the subject that he bothers answering ... pretending he 's totally up for it  and the media is honestly giving a biaised review of these `` negociations '' , portraying m\u00e9lenchon as the one asking for too much , giving signs that he wants to stop this sham . 
  so far , nothing happened . 
  but from the start , it was clear that the two would n't reach an agreement . 
  ( in my opinion , it 's the socialist party 's fault , not m\u00e9lenchon 's , but as i said , i support him ) . 
  they are supposed to - finally - meet tomorrow ( ? ), 
  i think . 
  and so , what is m\u00e9lenchon asking for ? 
  for concrete signs that hamon wo n't be following hollande 's path . 
  he wants hamon to openly distance himself and his candidacy from the right of the socialist party ( who lost the primary ) . 
  but , obviously , the party will never agree and hamon wo n't be the one to divide it . 
  and even if he did , would m\u00e9lenchon agree to let hamon be the candidate ? 
  why would he have to drop ? 
  why should n't it be hamon ? 
  how would they design a new program , with so little time left ? 
  it wo n't happen , it 's too late , the socialist primary was held much too late , hamon delayed meeting with m\u00e9lenchon ... 
  sad for the supporters of both candidates who were hoping for an alliance , but we were not really expecting it . 
  maybe i 'll be ( pleasantly ? ), 
  surprised , but i do n't think so ; theater : no one wants to be `` the one '' officially putting an end to the `` negociations '' . 
  * so ... the 5 main candidates to the presidency ( in 55 days ) are : marine le pen , emmanuel macron , fran\u00e7ois fillon , benoit hamon , jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon . 
  * ( plus other - much - smaller candidates : we 'll know who managed to gather enough sponsorship in about month ) . 
  - ** nicolas sarkozy joined the accorhotels international strategy committee ** . 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- other news - ** 3 men have been arrested for allegedly planning a terrorist attack ** . 
  they lived in 3 different cities , apparenly never met irl but only via social media . 
  they were allegedly in contact with the other terrorist cell arrested earlier this month . 
  only a tiny grenade was found in one of the 3 men 's home and no clear target was identified ( but the other cell seemed to be more dangerous , so if they were in contact ... ) . 
  good job from the intelligence services . 
  - ** a policeman was judged in a similar case to th\u00e9o 's rape ( from 2/3 weeks ago ) ** . 
  -2 / 3 weeks ago , i mentioned this young guy named th\u00e9o , who was raped by a policeman ( who inserted his baton 10 cm deep inside th\u00e9o 's anus , causing a serious injury ) . 
  this led to protests , denegations by the police unions - including a racist slur live on tv to defend their collegues - , marine le pen refusing to condemn the act but standing by the police ... th\u00e9o left the hospital , the trial will occur in several years , as usual . 
  - well another young man suffered from the same '' '' '' '' '' '' `` incident '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' in 2015 i think , and the trial was this week . 
  his lawyer asked for the charges to also be changed from `` voluntary violences '' to `` rape '' . 
  ( and , following th\u00e9o 's case , one of his friend came up to say that he had been beaten by the police just one week before - someone filmed him when the cops brought him to a corridor where they could n't be seen and there are pictures : his face is completely bruised , he clearly did n't make it up . 
  we also learnt that another similar '' '' '' '' `` incident '' '' '' '' had occurred several years ago , involving cops from the same police station and that the police chief who was in charge and failed to prevent it was promoted ... that time they had put a wheel cover up a man 's ass ( not rape , but ... f ***** up ) . 
  - ** a family of four has disappeared in brittany . 
  blood was found inside the house ** . 
  this kind of story happens `` quite regularly '' ( in general it 's the father who killed everyone ) . 
  and actually another family was murdered just a few kilometers away in 2011 : the mom and her 4 kids were murdered , very likely by the dad , who was never found . 
  it 's one of the most famous recent criminal cases in france . 
  there 's no indication the two are related in any way , but it makes you wonder . 
  - ** the annual c\u00e9sar ceremony - french oscars - occured on friday ** . 
  paul verhoeven 's `` elle '' won best picture and isabelle huppert won best actress . 
  xavier dolan won best director for `` just the end of the world '' and gaspard ulliel won best actor ( same movie ) . 
  `` i , daniel blake '' won best foreign film . 
  `` divines '' won 3 awards . 
  `` my life as a zucchini '' won best animated film and best adaptation . 
  there were several political messages during the ceremony : about police violence , about `` capitalism '' ( from the director who won the award for best documentary `` merci patron '' ) , from ken loach in his letter/acceptance speech and george clooney mentioned trump when receiving an honorary award ( jean-paul belmondo was also honored ) . 
  that 's it for this week i think ?
