  edit : oh yeah , trump said that `` paris is no longer paris '' and hollande replied but his comeback was bad . 
  it 's trending on twitter in france . 
  many articles in the newspapers online today . 
  i had already heard about these rumors a few months ago , but it was not widespread , it was contained to some `` alternative news '' sites from the fachosphere . 
  since this morning , a lot more french citizens have been `` informed '' about macron 's supposed `` double life '' . 
  it 's working . 
  philippot - marine le pen 's first advisor and spokesperson - is gay . 
  he never mentioned it , but the parisian elite `` bubble '' knew about it . 
  one day ( about 1 year and 1/2 or 2 years ago maybe ? ), 
  a tabloid outed him . 
  the vast majority of people were outraged ... well is n't it interesting to see a similar tactic being used , and shared mostly by far right homophobic idiots ? 
  my pleasure . 
  reading this thread is indeed pretty depressing ... 
  ** france ** : politics : - ** despite being in big trouble because of the `` penelopegate '' scandal , fran\u00e7ois fillon is still holding on , but probably not for long ** . 
  the winner of the right-wing primary , who was polled as the favourite to become the new french president in 3 months , is very likely not going to be able to make it . 
  new revelations this week * ( i 'm assuming you already know what the case is about . 
  if not , you can read my comment from last week 's thread ) * : - the newspaper that published the story last week continued their investigations and found that the sums allegedly earned by fillon 's wife , and two of his kids , amount to close to a million euros ( so about 300,000 euros more than the initial figures ) . 
  - in a ressurfaced interview from 2007 , penelope fillon clearly states that she never worked as her husband 's assistant . 
  ( which contradicts what they have been saying ... and also raises questions : more and more people are wondering whether she knew ??? ), 
  * ( there are other `` layers '' to this story . 
  fillon is not in trouble `` just '' because of his wife `` fake job '' . 
  again , check last week 's thread if you are interested ) * . 
  fillon claims to be the victim of an `` institutional coup '' , a `` manhunt '' ( from the left , to benefit macron ) . 
  he has not yet given up , and his party officially stands by him , but it 's clear to everyone that he 'll not be able to be the republican party 's candidate , he 'll have to quit pretty soon ( probably this week ) ( in a normal country , he would have de facto been eliminated from the race on day 1 ) . 
  he is still campaigning but , of course , journalists only ask him about the scandal . 
  and every time he goes out in public he is met by protesters who yell at him . 
  officially there is no `` plan b '' yet , but of course there will be one . 
  which one ? 
  well , hard to say : - alain jupp\u00e9 ? 
  he came second in the primary . 
  but so , he lost it . 
  besides , he too has been convicted in a similar scandal ( years ago ) , he had a different program ( so on which platform would he run ? 
  ) , he 's pretty old ( which might not be a good choice if he has to run against macron and hamon who are young ) . 
  and , when asked , he has said several times that he would not replace fillon ( but he might change his mind ) . 
  he was supposed to be fillon 's prime minister . 
  but he 's not that well known . 
  these are the two names that seem to be talked about the most . 
  but several other ambitious members of the party want to be chosen as well , so there is/will be huge internal `` fights '' to decide ... ( i ca n't wait to see how it all turns out , hihihi !!! ), 
  how will they pick a new candidate ? 
  well , organizing a new primary seems highly unlikely ( not enough time ) , so it 's probably going to be an internal designation , by a few hundreds people at the top of the party . 
  ( in case you 're wondering , sarkozy has remained silent . 
  of course he 's very likely playing a huge part behind the scene ) . 
  - ** marine le pen refused to pay back 300,000 euros to the european parliament ** . 
  in a similar case to the `` penelopegate '' , several national front parliamentary assistants have been paid by brussels although they were in fact working for the party , in paris . 
  le pen thus had to reimburse close to 300,000 euros but refused to do so . 
  ( this has been receiving way less media coverage than the fillon story - admittedly these people did work , but still . 
  the national front has several other `` cases '' , but none of them seem to be causing her harm ) . 
  - ** benoit hamon won the socialist primary last sunday ** . 
  i 'm assuming you heard about this . 
  he won against manuel valls , by quite a large margin . 
  now there remains to see where it all goes ; he is a bit `` torn '' or `` stuck '' between two different political lines : - the socialist party top members did n't want him to win ( think corbyn , it 's similar ) , they wanted a `` social democrat '' candidate . 
  they did the minimum when recognizing his victory ... but it seems that they are finally getting to terms with the situation and willing to appear united ( they are fooling no one but that 's already a huge effort of their part ... ) at least there was no `` migration '' towards macron , contrary to what we thought would happen . 
  - jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon - `` far left '' candidate whose program his quite similar to hamon 's - said he would be willing to think about an alliance with hamon , but on some conditions . 
  he basically asked hamon to be coherent , to be clear , to choose between his `` right-leaning '' socialist colleagues and the `` left-line '' he campaigned on during the primary , which is quite close to m\u00e9lenchon 's . 
  but hamon declined to do so : he 's conditioned to follow the rules and `` traditions '' of his political structure , he ca n't choose . 
  i do n't know whether he 'll try to campaign on the same exact program he had during the primary , or if his party will force him to `` modify '' it ( so as to appear `` more presidential and more credible '' : their words , not mines ) . 
  so in short : we have these two candidates appealing to similar electorates ... who will gather more votes ? 
  will they come to some form of agreement in the future weeks in order to unite and maximize their chances ? 
  it sounds unlikely . 
  ( before the primary , m\u00e9lenchon was polled in front of the future socialist candidate . 
  now he is said to have lost about 5 points , in favour of hamon . 
  i personally am suspicious , i do n't think these polls should be believed . 
  - ** macron , m\u00e9lenchon and le pen all had big rallies in the same city this weekend ** . 
  - emmanuel macron - the young and `` modern '' , `` neither right-wing , nor left-wing '' social-liberal candidate - had his yesterday . 
  he still has n't disclosed his program . 
  so he spoke for more than 1h30 and it was void . 
  it was kind of a mix between an evangelical pastor and a steve jobs sort of entrepreneur speech ... ( yep , i do n't like him . 
  i can recognize that he praised the values of liberty , egality and especially fraternity , as well as the idea of benevolence , which is a nice change from the fear-mongering and declinist rethorics we are so used to hearing . 
  but : sorry , that 's not enough to apply as president of the republic , you need more substance than just these advert catchwords . 
  please respect us and our intelligence , if that 's not too much to ask ) . 
  - jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon - `` far-left '' candidate - had his rally today and ... he duplicated himself !, 
  he used an hologram to appear both in lyon and in paris . 
  it 's a world premiere ( holograms have already been used , to ressucitate death singers for instance , or by other politicians such as erdogan . 
  but never live : it was always pre-recorded ) . 
  in his 1h30 speech , he talked about new technologies , video games , comic books , etc to detail his program on education , culture , industry and the environment . 
  ( he hosts about 2 rallies per week i think since last september , so in each one he focuses on some parts of his program ) . 
  - marine le pen also had her ( first ) rally today in the same city . 
  she ( finally ) published her program yesterday or the day before . 
  it is not very different from the 2012 one . 
  her 1h speech focused on two threats : globalism and islamism . 
  ( attendance-wise , between these 3 candidates , m\u00e9lenchon won . 
  there were also a lot of people for macron . 
  less for le pen , but the place she chose was smaller , and we can assume people may be less willing to show their faces to the cameras for a national front rally which is n't indicative to what french people will do inside the polling booths . 
  but so there were thousands of people attending macron and m\u00e9lenchon 's rallies , inside the venues but also outside ) . 
  ( to be clear : i 'm pro-m\u00e9lenchon . 
  other french redditors can feel free to add a comment to give a different perspective ) . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ other news : - ** louvre attack ** you heard about it already i assume ? 
  - ** a young man was allegedly raped by 4 policemen in the suburbs of paris ... ** apparently they penetrated him with a baton while violently arresting him . 
  the scene occurred in broad daylight on the street and was filmed by witnesses , but the images are not clear enough to really see what is happening . 
  but we do see that his trousers are lowered when the policemen leave him and there was blood on the sidewalk . 
  anyway the doctor said he had been anally penetrated . 
  yesterday , when the story was making the news , it was a bit weird : i read some articles talking about rape ( giving this version ) but also others that were talking about a `` violent arrest '' only . 
  then the rape was denied ... today it seems that the acts have been requalified to voluntary violences instead of rape and even the very right-leaning mayor of the city , who is always very on side with the police has publicly said it was a shame . 
  edit : finally one of the policemen was charged with rape , the 3 others with voluntary violences . 
  all 4 have been suspended . 
  good . 
  for once . 
  this is a local story you probably do n't care about much , but i think it might stay in the news for a while . 
  you may remember that a young black man was killed by the police this summer ( the adama traor\u00e9 case ) and it caused major controversy in the suburbs but was largely ignored by politicians and by most french people . 
  well of course this story may lead to further anger .
