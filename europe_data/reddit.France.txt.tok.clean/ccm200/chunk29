  people protested/rioted yesterday night . 
  ( i 'm tired today , so please feel particularly free to correct any mistake i made this week ) . 
   it also falls to the reddit trap of overthinking everything so many people hate that he does n't have a clear plan so far ... 
  sorry for overthinking about the choice of our next president when we see that macron still does n't have a program . 
  elitist grumpy french leftists !, 
  oh you want macron to win !, 
  ... can you list 3 of his proposals , the ones that convinced you and might convince others ? 
  ( he still does n't have a program . 
  the first round is in less than 3 months , he created his movement almost 10 months ago and announced his candidacy 2 months ago ) .

  ** france ** : politically-heavy week , i think it 's safe to say the presidential campaign has begun !, 
  * ( i keep talking about it , but never mention when it is : in 3 months . 
  1st round : 23rd of april , 2nd round : 7th of may ) . 
  * - ** today is the second round of the socialist party primary : hamon is likely to win against valls ** . 
  - last week , benoit hamon came 1st with 36 % of the votes , manuel valls 2nd with 31,5 % . 
  the 3rd candidate , arnaud montebourg , asked his supporters ( 17,5 % ) to vote for hamon . 
  most of the other candidates rallied behind valls , but their combined votes are less important . 
  mathematically , mamon is predicted to win . 
  - valls ' main line of attack this week was ... yes , of course : islam ( and women 's rights ) !, 
  ( valls and hamon both became famous politically as mayors of a town in the suburbs of paris . 
  but their conceptions of `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' , `` communautarism '' , security , etc differ . 
  valls agressively attacked hamon on this , accusing him of being `` ambiguious '' , of potentially compromising with radical islamists , a minister close to valls - asking not to be named - even said to journalists that hamon is the muslim brotherhood 's candidate ... 
  this is of course a pile of lies based on absolutely nothing , but the party did n't say anything , journalists barely called valls on it ) . 
  valls also continued to use the same argument as before : `` hamon is a dreamer , what he promises is unrealistic '' , etc. . . - the final debate was followed by 5,5 millions of people , which is way more than the 3 debates before the 1st round , but way less than the final debate for the right-wing primary in november . 
  hamon won the debate . 
  ( i 'm pro-hamon , but i think it 's objectively what most journalists recognized , even if the vast majority of them were clearly supporting valls ' arguments . 
  the polls said the same things ) . 
  fun fact : edward snowden apparently watched at least a bit of it , since he retweeted 2 tweets in favour of hamon ( he speaks french because he spent several years in geneva ) . 
  - i should also mention that there was some pretty big `` confusion '' with the results of the first round . 
  they screwed up big time , took days to actually look into the `` issues '' . 
  it 's probably because they were hoping for at least 2 million voters and only got 1,6 ... now the consensus , the official story reported by the media is that it was some sort of `` individual human mistake '' that was not meant to rig the results ... 
  i just stopped trying to understand . 
  - ** main story this week : fran\u00e7ois fillon 's wife 's alleged fake jobs ... and more !, 
  ** * ( i 'm going to do my best but it 's going to be long and may not be clear , i 'm not a journalist  . 
  please correct any mistake i might make , fellow french redditors ) . 
  * there are several layers to this story ( and it might get bigger ) : - ** fillon hired his wife as his parliamentary assistant ** in 1998 . 
  then from 2002 to 2007 , she was hired by another deputy when he became minister . 
  in 2012 , when he became deputy again , he hired her once more ( until the jer\u00f4me cahuzac case emerged and mps were forced to be more transparent about their income ) . 
  hiring family is legal in france for mps ( around 15 % of them do ) , but the trouble is that it looks like she did not actually work . 
  there are a few testimonies saying she was seen in the national assembly or that she did work for her husband in his constituency ... but the vast majority of people claim they never knew she was his assistant , including other parliamentary assistants , including a journalist who wrote a biography about fillon . 
  there are several interviews of fillon 's wife ( one very recent ) in which she says she never got involved in her husband 's work , she 's a housewife . 
  -  over the course of nine years , she earned around 500,000 euros . 
  an investigation was launched the day following the revelations . 
  - ** his wife also allegedly earned big money in 2012/2013 , for her work as a literary advisor in a magazine ** own by a billionaire , friends with many politicians , including fillon . 
  problem is : all that could be found to prove she did work for said magazine were 2 or 3 short book reviews . 
  the director of the magazine was stumped when he heard about this , saying he never met her . 
  -  in 2012/2013 , she earned 100,000 euros for that ( this time it 's not public money , but still ) . 
  - when he went on tv 2 days after the news broke out to defend himself , ** fillon revealed that he also hired 2 of his kids ** to do some parliamentary work for him , since they are lawyers . 
  problems are : you 're not allowed to hire several family members at the same time ; they were not yet lawyers at the time , but law students ; upon looking into what type of work they could have possibly been doing , journalists found nothing that could apply ( i do n't remember exactly but given the training they had , the law specialization they chose , journalists could not find any bill fillon had worked on during that period , any parliamentary work that would have required the help of someone with said curriculums ) . 
  -  i have n't read how much they got paid exactly , i do n't know if the detail is known yet . 
  - recently , another newspaper revealed that between 2003 and 2014 , ** senators ** of the ump party ( now called les r\u00e9publicains , since they had to rebrand themselves because of some other mediatic case ) had for years ** redirected public funds to themselves , for their private benefits ... fillon is alleged to be one of them ** !, 
  -  between 2005 and 2007 , fillon allegedly stole around 25,000 euros . 
  there is already an investigation for this as well , but for now fillon is not part of it , because it 's only looking into what happened after 2009 ( when he was no longer a senator ) ( i do n't know why that is , but i guess his case will probably be dealt with as well ) . 
  this is not covered very much by the media ( yet ? 
  it broke out later in the week , and once again it 's m\u00e9diapart and , weirdly , when it 's this newspaper , other journalists do n't pick up on the story as much . 
  it * is * covered , but i mean , the attention is mainly on the story about his wife and given that it 's also important , even if it 's way less money , it should be covered more than it is ) . 
  - finally , another layer that is almost not covered at all is ** his mysterious company ** called `` 2f conseil '' : we know very little about this but it looks sketchy as hell and so i hope maybe another major story will break out in the next few weeks . 
  it is a consulting company . 
  he 's the sole partner and we do n't know anything about his clients , so there could be some conflicts of interests with companies buying him in exchange of political favours . 
  some could be russians , given fillon 's political stance on poutine ... 
  when asked , fillon 's team only mentioned lectures he gave at an energy conference in kazakhstan , and other lectures in moscow and in iran ... then fillon denied it all and refused to answer the questions . 
  this is legal ... but only because he created it just 10 days before the beginning of his deputy mandate in 2012 . 
  ( it is illegal for deputies to start a consulting business while they are mp , but since he registered the statutes 10 days before , he 's okay ! ), 
  -  between 2012 and 2015 he earned over 600,000 euros . 
  [ so ... ** will he drop out ? 
  - i do n't know . 
  he said if he 's charged he will ** . 
  the investigation ( into the main story/ies ) has begun , but it will take a while , i 'm not sure how long , ** but he likely wo n't be charged before the 1st round of the election ** . ], 
  [ a note to add that fillon 's first line of defense was to say that the attack was misogynist    and that several quotes of his , about `` assistance '' ressurfaced ( and also some pretty sexist stuff he said in the past ) ... 
  i could go on and on , but this story is already so long ! ], 
  [ the newspaper which published the story also hinted that they may have more details to reveal very soon , so it 's probably going to go on on tuesday when next week 's `` canard '' is out . ], 
  [ fillon has a major rally planned tonight in paris . 
  his wife ( who has n't appeared in public yet ) is supposed to be there , as was planned ... 
  so she 'll be surrounded by cameras and likely wo n't say anything . 
  i do n't know why they chose this strategy . ], 
  ( the national front is being very quiet about all this , because they too are dealing with a similar investigation : european parliamentary assistants paid although they were actually working for the party , in paris , instead of in bruxelles , on the stuff they were supposed to be working on ) . 
  - ** emmanuel macron was accused of using his ministry 's funds to prepare for his campaign . 
  ** this is getting very little attention . 
  so he is being accused of having used important sums of money during evening meetings he had in the months before he quit his position as minister to launch his own movement and announce his candidacy . 
  ( it 's not clear : this money is to be used by the minister when he has lunch with people for instance , but people say he used it to meet with all sorts of people he was consulting on the side , to advise him on his political plans , form a strategy ... so for his own political career , as opposed to as the minster for economy ) . 
  - ** claude gu\u00e9ant , former sarkozy minister , was fined for also using public money ** . 
  i 'm tired , google it . 
  ( pretty heavy week , innit ? ), 
  ah maybe ... 
  i did n't check on this again . 
  i did n't hear nor read that the initial reports were maybe wrong ? 
  no : emmanuel macron created his own `` political movement '' ( this summer ) and announced he would be running for president ( in september if i recall well ) , so he did not take part in this primary . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ so , on the `` left '' side of the spectrum , there are : emmanuel macron - `` en marche '' jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon - `` la france insoumise '' benoit hamon - parti socialiste ( if he does win next week , which seems likely ) * yannick jadot - europe ecologie les verts * * philippe poutou - nouveau parti anticapitaliste * * nathalie arthaud - lutte ouvri\u00e8re * listed according to the current polls , but take it with a grain of salt since they were quite wrong , again , about the results of this primary . 
  and because things are going to be evolving now that the presidential campaign is really beginning . 
  the ones in italics are small candidates who likely wo n't get more than 5 % of the votes ( their parties respectively got 2,3 % , 1,1 % and 0,5 % in 2012 ) . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ keep reading if you want more details . 
  so there are 3 main candidates on the `` left '' : m\u00e9lenchon reached 11 % in 2012 ( he 's currently predicted at a higher score , according to recent polls . 
  he 's attracting lots of people to his rallies , his youtube channel that he launched a few weeks ago is a real phenomenon . 
  but convincing more leftists to pick him as the strongest potential candidate for the left does not seem realistic and media coverage is n't favorable to him ... ... macron already has lots of supporters and attracts crowds to his meetings , but i think most of them are still uncertain at this stage ( mainly curious i mean ) . 
  however after the socialist primary , the race will really begin and we will probably see many socialists turn to him - because they are social democrats and do n't like hamon 's line ( voters , militants and also probably some politicians : how many ? 
  how many `` big names '' switching from the socialist party to `` en marche '' ? ) . 
  he 's got plenty of media coverage .
