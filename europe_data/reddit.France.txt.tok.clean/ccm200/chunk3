  finally the puppets will be spared but they may end up being re-scheduled ( maybe even from a daily show to a weekly one ... which makes no sense ) and as a result they may lose a lot of viewers and be cancelled nest year , right before the presidential campaign ( the chairman is a good friend of sarkozy 's so of course this news is highly political ) . 
  to give you an idea of what it looks like : [ the world company fucks the world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caczc6gyi9s ) . 
  ** france ** ** economy : ** - ** the pro-business `` macron law '' was passed in force using article 49-3 ** . 
  this is an article of the french constitution which enables the government to pass a law without a vote : the government knew it would n't have had a majority to vote it , because the left of the socialist party is agaisnt it ( too liberal ) and the right would have voted against it simply because they vote against any major law of the government . 
  this is an article that hollande had firmly criticised when the right used it , because it 's not democratic . 
  - ** transition to taxation of income at source announced ** : france is one of the few european countries where income tax is not systematically deducted at source , with workers instead filling out a complex tax declaration form on previous-year earnings and waiting in dread for the bill . 
  this will change in 2018 : in 2017 they will pay their tax bill for 2016 as usual but in 2018 will only pay at-source on their 2018 revenues . 
  ** tensions with italy : ** - ** nutellagate ** : our ecology minister , s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royal , urged people to stop eating nutella on the french equivalent of the daily show , because it destroys the amazonian forest . 
  she then tweeted her `` thousand apologies '' after matteo renzi 's wife ate nutella crepes with her daughter . 
  - ** continued tensions between france and italy over the situation of migrants in vintimille ** . 
  same as last week : migrants are stuck at the french-italian border . 
  ** sarkozy 's comedy tour continues : ** - ** sarkozy compared the eu asylum seekers plan to '' ` fixing a burst water pipe '' ** . 
  * `` there 's a house and a pipe bursts and floods the kitchen . 
  the repair man arrives and says : i 've got a solution : we 'll put half in the living room , a quarter in the parents ' bedroom and if that 's not sufficient , the rest in the children 's bedroom . 
  '' * as usual , he said this in an humorous way and his supporters were laughing . 
  but his sense of humor is not very `` charliesque '' . 
  also , ** sarkozy ** and several `` les r\u00e9publicains '' ( new name of his party ) members ** pronounced himself in favour of reconsidering the legitimacy of the principle of the `` droit du sol '' ** . 
  the `` droit du sol '' grants the french nationality to those born on french territory and who have lived in the country for five years since the age of 11 . 
  the proposed reform regarding this principle is one that marine le pen 's front national has been fighting for for over 25 years . 
  ** commemorations : ** - ** the 18h of june marked the commemoration of napoleon 's defeat in waterloo , but also charles de gaulle 's famous appeal ** . 
  ( hollande 's girlfriend , actress julie gayet , was present but it was because she was accompagnying her grandfather , a wwii verteran . 
  ( she 's still not officially first lady , she never appaers in public with the president . 
  our media love to talk about her whenever they have the occasion , but french people honestly do n't care ) ) . 
  ** other news stories : ** - ** saint-donatien basilica in nantes ravaged by flames ** . 
  ( an accident ) . 
  - ** tensions between taxi drivers and uberpop drivers . 
  ** - ** 12 year-old girl acrobat dies during lighthouse stunt at cap ferret lighthouse ** . 
  she was taking part in a tv show : `` france 's most loved monuments '' . 
  - ** beginning of the baccalaur\u00e9at ** . 
  - ** corsican parents were enraged at the prospect of their kids singing john lennon 's `` imagine '' in several langages , including ... arabic . 
  ** - ** today is the `` f\u00eate de la musique '' : professional and amateurs musicians and singers are in the streets all over the country ** . 
  ** also in the news : ** - pope 's address about the environment . 
  ( france will host the international global climate summit at the end of the year ) . 
  - greek situation . 
  - charleston shooting . 
  ** france ** : and : - ** a group of immigrants has been forcefully evicted several times this week in paris . 
  ** each time , they were sent either to overcrowded and filthy centers or to hostels but only for one night : after that , they went back on the streets or in a community garden ... were they were evicted again . 
  the media keep reporting it as follow `` they were offered accomodation , but it 's them who refused to stay there . 
  their demands for asylum were registered , but many of them do n't meet the criteria : they are economical immigrants looking for a better life , not refugees escaping wars . '', 
  ... actually we do n't have the true informations about that , a lot of them seem to be eritreans or syrians . 
  ** another group of immigrants are stuck at the french-italian border ** . 
  they say they want to cross the frontier and apply for asylum in france , germany , the uk or sweden . 
  but the french police is preventing them from moving . 
  - ** a disturbing video showing vincent lambert , a 38 year-old tetraplegic man in a ` vegetative state ' since 7 years , has been released ** by the part of his family who wants to keep him alive . 
  this is a case that has been going on for years . 
  his parents oppose his `` right to die '' , while the rest of the family - his wife and nephew mostly - say he had expressed a wish to die in case something like that would happen to him . 
  last week the european court of human right ruled in favour to upheld his life support ( ie : ` passive euthanasia ' , according to the french law , since ` real ' euthanasia itself is n't legal in france ) . 
  that was the last possible judicial appeal for his parents after the case went to several courts during the last 5 years or so . 
  in the video , we can see vincent lambert on his hospital bed , moving his eyes and mouth while ` listening ' to his mother announcing the decision of the european court over the phone ( held by a friend ) . 
  doctors say this is a manipulative video , since these movements are just reflexes . 
  basically his brain is dead . 
  also , of course some french media broadcasted the video without blurring the man 's face , although it 's of course illegal - he ca n't give his consent - and they should know it if they had studied ethics for 2 seconds . 
  but they happily showed the video anyway . 
  unsurprinsing . 
  - ** former imf director and ex-future-french-president dominique strauss kahn has been acquitted in the cartlon case : he 's not a pimp ** . 
  the case was about him receiving prostitutes as gifts from local people in the north , interested in being friends with him in case he ended up president . 
  the court ruled that dsk did n't know the women were prostitutes . 
  only one person was convicted : a dozen of people were acquitted , no one knew that they were prostitutes , that was not a attempt at corruption through sex services . 
  - ** controversy : pm manuel valls took his falcon jet plane to assist to the final of champions league with his kids in berlin last weekend . 
  ** at first he brushed it off , but later this week he acknowledged this was a `` mistake '' and announced that he would be paying 2,500 euros for his kids . 
  he even said he went there to meet michel platini and have a professional discussion about next year 's european cup . 
  ( confirmed by platini but false of course ) . 
  and another socialist said he went there `` because there are always ceo members and we need to talk to them to ensure we are chosen to host the olympic games '' . 
  they are stupid . 
  or rather : they think we are so stupid . 
  - ** jean-marie le pen has been ousted from his position of leader of the party ** , following the ( latest ) anti-semitic controversy a couple of months ago . 
  ( but the same day , jean-marie le pen took it to court to oppose his suspension from the national front party . 
  the judgment will be announced in early july i believe . ), 
  - ** three 15 year-old teenagers killed and another one heavily injured yesterday : they were apparently fabricating explosives or smoke grenades to play airsoft . 
  ** it was hot yesterday , which might be one of the reasons things turned out dramatically . 
  maybe relevant : agn\u00e8s varda said in an interview this week that she 's currently working on a film with [ jr ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=jr&amp;rlz=1c1ggge_frfr373&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=vol1vc2pdymru_m6g8gb&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=925 ) . 
  that 's all i know about it , i 'm thinking maybe this will resonate with la haine . 
  ( but maybe that wo n't be about the french banlieues at all ) . 
  according to you , nothing will ever change , that 's life . 
  they just have to find a way by themselves , but it wo n't work ? 
  is that is ? 
   nowadays , the problem and situations have nothing to do with the one of the 90 's . 
  kassovitz himself conceded that recently when saying he ca n't film `` la haine 2 '' because of communautarism and religious biases that forbid every sense of humour and second degree . 
  that 's not how i interpreted what he ( kassovitz ) said about a possible `` la haine 2 '' : i think he simply explained that `` la haine '' was `` a comedy '' and although he intends to write a second film , he has difficulties ( especially right now , right after the terrorist attacks ) to find the correct tone to use , because he wants to make a funny film again but is n't finding the current situation very funny to look at . 
  ie : i really do n't think he said that he ca n't make a funny film again because some people would be offended and that he feels like he has to censor himself . 
  it 's just that when he made `` la haine '' , he was younger and did things instinctively , whereas now he 's more intellectually aware of all the social and political aspects of it all , which i think is a bit of an obstacle for his artistic creativity . 
  i think he said things have n't really changed , even if what you wrote about communautarism and religious biases is true , but i think his way of seeing things is the same as op 's , not yours . 
  ( and i agree with them , not with you ) . 
  de rien / you 're welcome !, 
  - why did they rebrand their party ? 
  it 's not a first : the french right-wing party changed its name frequently since the beginning of the vth republic . 
  once every 10 years approximately . 
  after the rpf , the unr ( 1958 ) and the udr ( 1967 ) were based around charles de gaulle 's leadership ( the latter actually became `` pompidou 's party '' so to speak ) ; the rpr ( 1976 ) and the ump ( 2002 ) were based around jacques chirac . 
  this new party is centered around sarkozy . 
  the aim is to launch a new dynamic in order to be ( re - ) elected . 
  contrary to the left , where ideas and the program seem to be the main focus for the militants , on the right they tend to build their new campaign around one man , one leader , who needs to demonstrate that he wants to open a new path . 
  obvioulsy it 's a good easy way of putting an electoral defeat in the past and `` forget '' about it , symbolically . 
  it 's also convenient when affairs tarnished the reputation of the party . 
  ( happened during chirac 's presidency : the `` rpr '' became the `` ump '' . 
  and sarkozy , as well as many of his colleagues , have been suspected in numerous cases of corruption : changing the name from `` ump '' to `` les r\u00e9publicains '' is somehow gon na distanciate them from all this - for the moment no one has been convicted , but maybe some affairs will turn into problematic sentences for a few of them - anyway all these people whose image has been affected have kept their place inside the new party , nothing really changed except the name . ), 
  and , of course , it also puts internal arguments in the past , symbolically . 
  the ump is very divided , there was one episode in particular that illustrated it and greatly tarnished their image ( during the last vote for president of the party , between two of sarkozy 's rivals - j.f cop\u00e9 and f. fillon - who both claimed to have won the election and greatly ridiculed themselves , illustrating the false unity of the ump ) . 
  now that sarkozy came back ( although he claimed he quit politics immediately after his defeat in may 2012 ) , he 's president of the party and everyone is supposedly supporting him , they all agree on everything . 
  it 's just a facade obvioulsy but that 's what they want to publicize . 
  finally , they often say they want to create a new party for all tendencies of the right and the center .
