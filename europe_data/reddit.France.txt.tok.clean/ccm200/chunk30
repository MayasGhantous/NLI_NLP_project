  but he 's young , inexperienced in politics ( that 's his selling point , but it could become a problem ) , never got elected . 
  so mistakes can be made i mean . 
  political ones ( when trying to reach to all electorates for instance . 
  the poorest are n't coming to his rallies , he 'll need to convince them ; can he do it ? 
  or maybe when forming alliances with other parties . 
  for instance there 's a centre party called `` modem '' that got 9 % in 2012 ... it 's not clear what these electors are going to do . 
  some probably like macron , but the leader of the party heavily criticised him ... recently he seemed to have maybe changed his mind . 
  how will supporters from both camp react if an alliance is formed , although macron always said he does n't want to repeat the same `` political tactics '' that failed other parties ? 
  how will people react if macron is joined by well known socialist politicians : wo n't they feel like his promise has been `` corrupted '' and that he 's turning into the same professional tactical politician as the others ? 
  ) ; and communication-wise , i think macron could also make some mistakes . 
  running a political campaign is hard , it 's his very first and it 's the presidential . 
  ( the media love to destroy the ones they praised so much before . 
  and macron already had `` issues '' with workers and unionists . 
  he 'll need to be careful with his words during the next 4 months . 
  it 's long . 
  anything can happen . 
  his candidacy is objectively `` strong '' right now , but it also feels like it 's based on weak foundations . 
  the socialist candidate is going to have a hard time competing with these 2 . 
  is he going to drop and rally behind one of them to ensure a candidate from the `` left '' has more chances to reach the second round ? 
  seems unlikely : that would mean `` betraying '' the millions of people who just chose him during this primary ( and payed to vote - one euro for each round ) . 
  on the other hand i voted for hamon but i would be really glad if he dropped and asked his supporters to vote for m\u00e9lenchon ( but it wo n't happen and even if it did , most of them would n't like it at all and would n't do it ) . 
  the primaries are kinda new in france . 
  it 's only the 3rd/4rth . 
  before that , it was `` admitted '' that a `` strong '' leader should naturally and logically emerge from the big parties . 
  the first primary was in 2011 , for the socialists ( which hollande won ) . 
  in november the right followed the trend ( although they had been critical of this system 5 years before ) and since many french people want a change from the left , it was very successful . 
  the greens had theirs too ( nobody cared ) and the socialists organised this one ... ... but it was originally planned specifically to make sure hollande would win it and confirm his status of only logical runner for the left ( they picked a very late date that was supposed to be a springboard for the beginning of the `` real '' presidential campaign , then hollande decided not to run , valls and peillon decided to run at the last minute . 
  meanwhile emmanuel macron decided to go solo in the summer/fall and more and more disappointed left-wing voters began to see him as a good alternative . 
  others , more on the left , are behind m\u00e9lenchon - who announced his candidacy very early . 
  ( fillon managed to gather a lot of supporters on the right . 
  marine le pen has n't even began campaigning but the polls do n't budge and they 're good ) . 
  -  the socialist party got bypassed and it 's going to be difficult to change things in the next 4 months . 
  many people now see them all as losers . 
  ( for instance i voted for hamon , but i wo n't vote for him in the real election in may . 
  i simply wanted to say that i want a left-wing line for the socialist party , instead of social democrats . 
  i still do n't know who i 'm going to vote for exactly , maybe m\u00e9lenchon , maybe the small `` npa '' far left candidate , maybe the small green candidate , but not hamon , cause he 's from the socialist party and even if his program is imo quite good , i do n't believe he would apply it if he ever won and became president , i just do n't trust them anymore ) . 
  totally unrelevant to your comment but anyway , 
  that 's what i predicted at the beginning of the campaign , but since the polls kept saying valls was 1st and hamon and montebourg close behind , i thought there would n't be a huge surge for hamon , although that 's what i `` felt '' was happening around me and on social media , etc. 
  ( i mean , they did see hamon rising in the end , but did n't predict montebourg 's result would be quite low . 
  and they always said valls would be first . 
  so , once again , do n't be influenced by them ... ) hamon energized left-wing voters , but it 's not as spectacular as with fillon in november . 
  hard to say . 
  not me . 
  but the majority would do it . 
  in 2002 when her father reached the second round , chirac was elected with 82 % ... well now 15 years later if that happens again , it 's clear that less people will vote to counter her . 
  ( because this time it would n't be a shock , a massive surprise - she 's been predicted to reach the second round for years ; because her image is less frightening than her dad 's ; and because a bigger % of leftists wo n't agree to vote for the right again to `` save democracy '' ) . 
  but also , bear in mind that fillon may not be her opponent : things are really uncertain at the moment but macron , notably , could be the one everyone rallies with . 
  i 'm not sure ... at first i thought it meant that the people who voted were probably old ( people who take part in intermediate , local , elections or primaries tend to be retired folks ) , therefore it was probably good for manuel valls and not so good for benoit hamon and arnaud montebourg . 
  but i heard a journalist saying they are seeing more and more younger voters now in the afternoon . 
  i do n't know , really . 
  the polls had valls , hamon and montebourg really close to one another and i think the low turnout might mean that there is n't going to be much surprise and thus the second and third candidate may end up with similar votes . 
  ( unlike in the right-wing primary , in which many people voted , because 1 ) they were enthusiastic about fillon - and he surprised everyone with a large advance ; 2 ) they wanted to vote `` against '' sarkozy - there does n't seem to be a similar effect for the left : people who want to say `` f *** you '' to valls ( and hollande ) are doing so by * not * taking part in this vote ) . 
  i think . 
  ( but most importantly , people are not voting mostly because the winner of this primary - whoever ends up winning - is at the moment predicted to come 5th during the presidential election - behind le pen , fillon , macron and m\u00e9lenchon . 
  it does n't seem really important/relevant to most electors ) . 
  ** france : ** - ** first round of the socialist primary today ** . 
  low turnout . 
  edit : ** qualified for the second round : benoit hamon ( 36,30 % ) & manuel valls ( 31,12 % ) ** . 
  arnaud montebourg is third ( 17,55 % ) , vincent peillon ( 6,85 % ) , fran\u00e7ois de rugy ( 3,88 % ) , sylvia pinel ( 1,98 % ) , jean-luc bennahmias ( 1,01 % ) . 
  montebourg asked his electors to vote for hamon . 
  peillon did n't rally any of the two . 
  ** hamon is therefore likely to win next sunday ** . 
  - ** manuel valls got slapped in the face by a young far right protester ** . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcjjpef4iiq ) ( it looks here like he did n't manage to hit him , but in other videos you could see that he did reach his face and slapped him ) . 
  the protester shouted `` it 's britanny here ! '', 
  and his social media showed that he 's a far right militant . 
  he was sentenced the next day ( 3 months suspended sentence ) . 
  - ** it 's cold ** . 
  i think that 's it , brexit and trump were the major other stories this week . 
  sorry , i totally forgot to reply . 
  good question , i should have been more precise . 
  these two were charged because they helped them cross the border . 
  until 2012 , you could be sentenced to 5 years and 30,000 euros for simply helping undocumented immigrants . 
  in 2012 the law was revised : you are now supposed to only be charged if you help them in exchange for compensations ( financial of course , but also if you ask them to do some housework , etc. . . ) and if you help said immigrants cross a border . 
  ( but there are many migrants in that region , next to the italian border and citizens argue that they are only being human since they 've seen countless refugees walking in the mountains , and reaching their villages , exhausted ... and that the region officials only took care of a few hundreds underaged migrants - the law says they of course have to assist them , but they turn a blind eye ) .

  ** france ** : politics : - ** the first debate between the 7 candidates of the left-wing primary was pretty uneventful ** . 
  the second debate is broadcasted today ( at 6pm ) ; the third and final televised debate before the first round will be held on thursday ( = yes , 3 debates in one week : very short campaign ) . 
  then , after the ** first round ( next sunday ) ** , there will be a fourth debate between the 2 leading and remaining candidates , and the second round is in two weeks . 
  this 1st debate did n't attract many viewers ( 3,8 millions vs 5,6 last november for the 1st debate of the * right * - wing primary ) . 
  according to the polls , voters who say they are certain to take part in this vote are far less numerous than in november . 
  basically this race is n't interesting french people that much . 
  maybe it will change in the last remaining days , but it does n't look like it . 
  ( there are also fewer polling stations open than there were for the primary of the right , which might discourage some voters . 
  plus , it could snow , etc. . . ) according to the polls , manuel valls is still leading . 
  the second place seems to be a tie between benoit hamon and arnaud montebourg ( these two are on the left of the socialist party ) . 
  personally , hamon is still my favourite ( or rather the only one i actually like , i would n't bother to go vote for any of the others ) and as i said before , it seems that he may be the `` fran\u00e7ois fillon '' of the left : meaning the candidate people did n't take into account at first but whom viewers felt he had the most convincing program and attitude . 
  but will enough people have bothered to listen to him ? 
  i genuinely feel that he 's the one who is generating the most enthusiasm , but i may be wrong , since the polls still put valls in the same position . 
  he 's very well liked by young voters , but how many will vote ? 
  - ** emmanuel macron and jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon both continue to attract a lot of people to their rallies ** . 
  the winner of the `` left-wing '' primary ( which is actually rather the socialist party primary ) will have two strong opponents . 
  emmanuel macron , the young , `` neither left-wing nor right-wing '' newcomer to politics does not seem to be a `` bubble '' after all . 
  he 's a serious threat to all candidates , but especially to the future socialist party candidate . 
  jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , the far-left candidate , is also doing pretty well .
