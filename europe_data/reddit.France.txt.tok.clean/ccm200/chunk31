  his youtube channel is the phenomenon of this beginning of the presidential race . 
  - ** fran\u00e7ois fillon ( winner of the right-wing primary ) is very firm on his program , plus he announced harsh measures concerning immigration ** . 
  since the political debate is focused on the left for now , he is less present in the media . 
  but he answered the criticism about his plans concerning healthcare and also added more fuel to the fire with new measures about immigration . 
  he does n't intend to budge . 
  - ** marine le pen visited the trump tower ** . 
  the national front candidate still has n't really began campaigning . 
  she 's waiting for both primaries to be over and intends to run a short campaign . 
  but we do hear her main adviser florian philippot everyday in the media , as usual . 
  she did n't meet donald trump , but she had coffee in the hall with one of his advisers guido lombardi . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------ - ** record dividend for the cac 40 in 2016 ** . 
  the 40 biggest french companies have renewed with the pre-2008 crisis situation . 
  meanwhile , the part allocated to wages is on the same level as it was 20 years ago . 
  what could go wrong ? 
  - ** the flu epidemic is particularly nasty this year . 
  hospitals are overwhelmed ** . 
  - ** 10 people have been charged in the kim kardashian robbery case of last october ** . 
  17 people were arrested , some were released ( including her french driver : you may have heard he was suspected , well apparently investigations were not conclusive ) . 
  they are all very well known by the police for organized crime . 
  and they are pretty old ( 40s , 50s , 60s and the oldest is 72 year-old . 
  there may be some younger ones too , i do n't have all the details ) . 
  - ** isabelle huppert won a golden globe for her performance in `` elle '' ** . 
  - ** french astronaut thomas pesquet performed his first spacewalk ** . 
  alongside his us colleague , on the international space station . 
  ** france ** : not much i think . 
  - ** 2 year anniversary of the charlie hebdo and hyper cacher attacks ** . 
  and the attack against a police woman , who was shot on her own between these two attacks . 
  - ** 2 men have been tried for helping refugees ** . 
  2 different cases , both judged in nice this week : - a farmer , c\u00e9dric herrou , living in the mountains near the italian border helped hundreds of eritreans and sudanese migrants cross the border and hosted them in caravans and tents in his garden . 
  the prosecutor requested a 8 month suspended sentence , the actual sentencing will be known next month . 
  - a teacher-researcher , pierre-alain mannoni , was arrested while he was driving 3 exhausted eritrean female migrants whom he intended to host at his place for one night before driving them to the train station , to help them reach marseille . 
  he was first sentenced to a 6-month suspended sentence in november , then acquitted this week , but the prosecution appealed so there will be another trial . 
  3 other people from the same region will be judged in april for similar acts . 
  - ** the avian flu crisis is still going on ** . 
  lots of animals killed . 
  - ** many teachers are resigning . 
  ** due to their difficult working conditions , especially for new teachers who have been badly trained . 
  - ** a 105 year-old beat a cycling record ** . 
  it was all over the news ... like seriously , he 's cute and all but it was a bit of a circus freak . 
  - ** french version of the saturday night live began this week ... on thursday !, 
  ** yes , it is called the `` saturday night live '' ... ( and i think it wo n't even be a weekly thing , so why call it that ?! ), 
  ( ** politically : not much . 
  the left-wing primary `` battle '' will really begin next week , with the first debate ( s ) . 
  ** ) ( side note : i love the new-ish header images , especially this magritte one ! ), 
  edit : oh there was also a female cashier who apparently had a miscarriage on her seat , in the supermarket . 
  even though she told her managers that she was pregnant , she was n't allowed to take breaks , to go to the loo . 
  she would feel bad , have nausea , without being able to take a break . 
  one day she felt really bad , got up from her seat , it was covered in blood . 
  according to her testimony , even after she came back from the hospital , after losing her baby , they did n't show any empathy . 
  ** france ** : - [ manuel valls got flour-bombed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktbqlcersgw )  former pm and now candidate to the left-wing primary was `` attacked '' by a protester who shouted * `` 49.3 , we do n't forget , we do n't forgive !, 
  '' * last week , manuel valls announced that he now plans to get rid of this controversial constitutional article called `` 49.3 '' although he used it 6 times in the past years . 
  ( it is considered undemocratic by many , because it allows the government to `` bypass '' parliament , to pass a law without the agreement of mps who do n't get to vote . 
  it was last used 6 months ago , for the labour reform , although millions of people had been protesting for 4 or 5 months ) . 
  how are people reacting ? 
  i mean , for instance on a scale of 1 to 10 , if you had to measure the anger ? 
  how does it manifest itself ? 
  what do you think it will lead to , politically , in the medium and long term ? 
  ( edit : this comment is a follow up to my own main comment for this week : lack of space ... you know me . 
  it was removed by a bot because i linked a picture from twitter . 
  i 've messaged the mods in the hope that they allow it back . 
  sorry i 'm too lazy to repost everything ) . 
  * more details * ( again , sorry for the long post , if you do n't care/hate it ... ) - ** left-wing primary ** : - ** manuel valls ** : hollande 's prime minister until one week ago & his interior minister before that . 
  right of the party . 
  * pros * : his years of experience inside the government ; he 's the most famous ; he 's a `` strong man '' ( people want `` strong '' , `` manly '' , autoritarian leaders apparently ... ) ; he has the support of most of the government and of the party ( most people have probably forgotten but in the 2011 primary , he only managed to get 5 % of the votes ! ), 
  * cons * : he has to defend hollande 's legacy ( which is also his own ) despite the bad approval ratings and while proposing something new and better at the same time ; he keeps promising he 's the only one who can unite the left while he has said many times that there are two `` irreconcilable lefts '' ( and that the socialist party should explode and be renamed ) . 
  finally , this week he had the guts to announce that he would get rid of the `` 49.3 '' constitutional article that he used 6 times as pm !, 
  ( this was mostly mentioned last spring when it was used to pass the `` infamous '' labour reform ... remember when millions of people protested in the street ? 
  and he also used it to pass a law by economy minister emmanuel macron ... who now is his rival ) . 
  - ** vincent peillon ** : hollande 's education minister at the beginning of the mandate , now a mep . 
  center of the party . 
  * pros * : since he wants to offer an alternative between the 2 main political lines , he may be seen as a good compromise . 
  ( but to be honest , i personally have trouble understanding where he really stands . 
  maybe that 's just me , but when i look at his trajectory , he was close to people who were leaning on the left ... before choosing to rally behind dominique strauss kahn in 2011 ... and then he chose hollande when the dsk scandal emerged ( = the rape of a cleaning lady in a new york sofitel hotel , if you did n't recall ) ; he has the support of a good number of quite important socialists . 
  * cons * : his mandate was short and since then he disappeared . 
  he 's not very famous and his candidacy is last minute ( i heard one of his allies saying he will be presenting his program on the 6th of january ... 
  i mean others have been working on a detailed program for months and months ) ; if it 's not just me , people will see him as a kind of hollande copycat : an insignificant loser ... - ** arnaud montebourg ** : hollande 's former economy minister before being fired for criticizing valls ( ` political line ) . 
  left of the party . 
  * pros * : is quite experienced and quite famous ; his political line . 
  ( he came third in the 2011 primary with 17 % of the votes , which is n't bad ) . 
  * cons * : some of his opponents are going to criticize him for criticizing hollande so much after having been inside of the government for 2 years himself ; he is perceived as a `` snob '' by many ( because of his voice/accent , which makes him sound like a posh person - although he 's actually not from a very priviledged background , apparently it 's just his voice . 
  but also more generally because of the way he speaks , which makes he seem quite full of himself ) . 
  - ** benoit hamon ** : hollande 's former minister for social economy and consumer affairs & then education minister , before being fired for criticizing valls ( 's political line , at the same time as montebourg ) . 
  left of the party . 
  ( my favourite ) . 
  * pros * : the guy has actually worked hard , his program offers a clear vision and is detailed ; observers are beginning to speculate that he could well be the `` fillon '' of the left ( = the candidate who was not considered important at first but whom people ( re - ) discovered during the campaign and judged more serious than the others ) . 
  * cons * : not very famous , not very experienced , quite young ; same as montebourg : some of his opponents are going to criticize him for criticizing hollande so much after having been inside of the government for 2 years himself ; his program is quite similar to montebourg , who is more famous . 
  - ** sylvia pinel ** - radical party of the left : hollande 's former commerce , craft and tourism minister , & then housing minister . 
  the only woman in this race ( they needed one so as not to look bad ) . 
  center-left . 
  - ** fran\u00e7ois de rugy ** - green : mp . 
  he 's always been a hollande supporter . 
  there have been divisions inside the green family , resulting in 2 separate parties ( again , because some were critical of the government 's right-leaning line ) . 
  the other party ( which is more on the left ) held its own separate primary in november ( the winner was yannick jadot = who already is one of the candidates for the presidential election ) . 
  - ** jean-luc bennahmias ** - democratic front : mep . 
  center left ecologist . 
  * what are the polls saying ? 
  * you may ask : i think it 's not relevant , they really do n't mean aything right now . 
  obviously valls is by far the most famous . 
  and then there are montebourg and hamon who are quite similar , so it 's hard to predict if one will `` steal the show '' or if they will end up with similar votes . 
  peillon is a big question mark , i really have no clue .
