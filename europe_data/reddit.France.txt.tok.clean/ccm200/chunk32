  ( the 3 others are very likely to be quite irrelevant ) . 
  ------------------------------------- - ** adama traor\u00e9 ( & his brothers ) ** : it 's in two parts : ** - ** in july , a young black man called adama traor\u00e9 was arrested by the police , although they were looking for his brother ( suspected in an extortion case ) . 
  they arrested adama although they were looking for his brother and they know him and all his family . 
  he then died . 
  the family immediately suspected a police blunder ( right term ? ) . 
  they learnt about his death the next day i think . 
  found it `` pretty '' suspicious and tried to alert people and the press . 
  young people in their neighborhood gathered in front of the police station , it was tensed . 
  we were told the autopsy revealed adama suffered from a `` severe infection '' that could well explain his death ( `` see , these irrational young violent people from the ghetto are playing the victims although he died from natural causes , of course ! '' ) . 
  then we were told a second autopsy ( asked by the family ) revealed that `` no evidence of significative violence '' could explain his death ( `` see , once again they are proven wrong !, 
  sad ! '' ), 
  but also did n't mention the `` severe infection '' anymore ... 
  this story regularly appeared in the news for weeks this summer and finally in september ... they were right : we now know that he was chocked to death because 3 policemen `` climbed '' on him . 
  he told them he could not breathe , they brought him to the station regardless and only called the emergency services after he had been unconscious for several minutes . 
  one of the firefighters later revealed that - contrary to what the policemen claimed in their testimonies - he found adama traor\u00e9 lying unattended ( the policemen of course said they tried cpr ) . 
  i think the police also told the family ( who called the police station requiring about his arrest ) that they were about to give him a meal ( although he was already dead at that point ) . 
  and they filed a complaint against him after he was already dead !, 
  ( most french people did n't care about it and it never was a `` huge story '' , but amongst those who `` cared '' there were 2 opposite views - as you can easily guess : you had the family , people from the local community , young people from the suburbs of france , antiracist militants , etc who were closely following the case and asking for it to be independently and seriously addressed . 
  and you had other people who rejoiced without apparently really trying to find out about the truth ( they had already made up their minds ) . 
  ** - ** in september , one of adama 's sisters was interviewed on tv ( by an arab host ... she was only invited by him and then by another tv show , if i recall well . 
  what i mean here is ... had it been a white man , i think we can safely speculate it would have been different , covered more , commented by politicians , by the interior minister , etc. ... . ) she said `` we have been living in this town for almost 30 years and have been treated like strangers . 
  the mayor chose her side , she sided with the policemen . 
  which means she sided with police violence . 
  she never expressed her condolences , she never addressed a sign . '', 
  the mayor chose to ... file a defamation case !, 
  of course !!!, 
  so in november , relatives of the family tried to enter the city hall to witness the city council - as is their right - during which the mayor had planned to vote the financing of the legal fees . 
  they were denied , progressively more and more people gathered in front of the city hall to protest and 8 police officers were alledgedly hurt . 
  amongst the 50 people present , two of adama 's brothers were charged ... and sent to jail ( of course ! ) . 
  so they have been heavily sentenced to 8 and 3 months of jail respectively and a 7000 euros damages . 
  one policeman suffered immensely ... he was biten by his own dog ; one policewoman received tear gas ... from herself or from a colleague , i do n't remember exactly . 
  the two brothers were identified as the culprits because of the color of his jacket for one the brothers ( although the color varied from brown , to beige , to black and no search was made to retrieve it and see if it matched ) , because of his `` unconventional '' hairstyle for the other . 
  ** france ** * ( i always write super long comments . 
  i know some people have said they appreciate it , but i 'm sure others may find it `` a bit '' too much and do n't want to read all of it . 
  since i 'm exceeding the limit this week ( 1rst time !, 
  ) , i 'll put the details in a follow up comment ) . 
  * - ** 7 candidates will be competing in the left-wing primary next month . 
  ** 6 men & 1 woman ( just like in the right-wing primary last month ) . 
  4 of them are socialists , the 3 others are from other ( small ) parties ( and have little chance to win ) . 
  * see comment below for the list * . 
  - ** imf chief christine lagarde faced a negligence trial : judgement will be announced on monday . 
  ** when she was sarkozy 's finance minister in 2007 , she was in charge of overseeing a politically charged arbitration case : bernard tapie - a famous french businessman , former owner of the marseille football club , of addidas , also a former tv host and even actor ... 
  he has ties to politics : he was a minister under the socialists in the 90s , before supporting sarkozy - was awarded more than 400 million euros to settle a dispute with the partly state-owned bank cr\u00e9dit lyonnais . 
  lagarde is thus accused of negligence leading to the misuse of hundreds of millions of euros in public money ( in favour of this tapie guy ) . 
  it 's quite complex to explain so [ source in english ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/business/international/christine-lagarde-trial-imf-france.html?_r=0 ) will explain things better than me . 
  she is being judged by a `` special '' court : the court of justice of the republic . 
  which means that she is being judged by her peers , basically . 
  she likely wo n't be charged ( if she is , she obviously would have to resign from the imf ) . 
  she denied being negligent . 
  - ** the 2 brothers of a young black man killed by the police this summer have been heavily sentenced for violence against the police . 
  ** this one is complex too . 
  * see comment below for the details * , if you 're interested . 
  - ** new arrests have been made regarding the terrorist attack in nice ( july ) and also in the attempted attack on notre dame ( september ) ** . 
  nice : 3 men suspected of providing logistical help ( providing weapons to the terrorist ) . 
  6 people had been arrested previously . 
  notre dame : a woman with close ties to one of the 4 women previously arrested . 
  - ** heavy pollution still , in paris and grenoble mainly ** . 
  - ** the new miss france was just elected ** . 
  it 's miss guyana , aka [ alicia aylies ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cx8srhawgaalhyz.jpg ) . 
  and one poor contestant fell on the stage and hurt herself ... 
  ** france ** - good news for once : ** j\u00e9r\u00f4me cahuzac , former budget minister who fought tax evasion , was sentenced to 3 years in jail for ... tax fraud ** . 
  in 2013 , a few months only after being appointed as minister , journalists at investigative online newspaper m\u00e9diapart revealed he had an undeclared swiss bank account . 
  oh but he did n't resign immediately ( like in any other civilised country ) : he fucking lied about it in the national assembly , and on tv . 
  and hollande believed him ( or rather , did n't even ask him whether it was true or false , if i remember correctly ) . 
  and the rest of the journalists were `` skeptical '' about their colleagues ' allegations . 
  so it actually took a good month ( even more than that i think , my memory is a bit fuzzy ) before the truth finally came out and everyone finally accepted to cover it properly . 
  this of course caused a massive public outrage . 
  cahuzac is a former cosmetic surgeon ( specialised in hair transplants ) . 
  following this scandal , hollande ordered his ministers to disclose their personal wealth ( cause that was n't the case before in france ... ! ), 
  ... but he wo n't be sleeping in jail anytile soon since he announced he would appeal the verdict and can stay free in the meantime . 
  - ** manuel valls announced his candidacy to the presidency . 
  he resigned and was replaced by cazeneuve who is our new prime minister ** . 
  following hollande 's announcement last week , as we expected , manuel valls quit the government and announced his candidacy to the left-wing primary . 
  hollande chose bernard cazeneuve ( interior minister until then ) to replace him as pm for the 5 remaining months before the election . 
  ( and our new interior minister is called bruno le roux ) . 
  - by the way , there 's a `` surprise '' new candidacy for this primary : vincent peillon . 
  well it 's not official yet , but he 's very likely going to announce it tomorrow . 
  peillon was the education minister at the beginning of hollande 's mandate ( before being replaced ) . 
  journalists say this is a tactical candidacy to hurt valls ( a kind of alliance between some of hollande 's friends and other socialists who are more on the left than hollande ) . 
  but this likely wo n't have a real impact on the race at all . 
  this is a pretty desperate move on their part ( but hey , i can understand them , things look so shitty that : why not ? ) . 
  peillon is n't that popular , people have forgotten about him , he 's joining late and is going to have to write a program in a week . 
  all candidacies will be official on the 15th : for now the list still is n't set in stones . 
  the party ejected several small candidates from small parties ( that were supposed to be welcome in this primary , but finally not ... what a surprise ! / s ) ; one `` smallish '' socialist candidate dropped out so as not to ruin the chances of the left-leaning line ... arnaud montebourg and benoit hamon are very probably be going to be valls ' main opponents . 
  but nothing is certain just yet as i said . 
  wait and see . 
  ( so yeah , this is looking pretty bad , the campaign will occur during the holidays , we do n't even know when the televised debates will occur ... how many potential electors will watch them if they are broadcated when people are more busy with their families and if they happen close to one another ... 
  but things are quite open , a surprise - like we saw with fran\u00e7ois fillon on the right - is possible , given the context ) . 
  - ** the state of emergency will be renewed ( again !, 
  ) : until mid-july ( ie : after the elections ) ** . 
  when the prime minister resigns , the state of emergency has to be voted again . 
  ( they would have prolonged it anyway , it had become pretty clear that they would not take any - political - risk during the election ) . 
  the state of emergency was declared after the paris attacks , so it 's been over a year . 
  - ** football leaks : paul pogba has millions of euros in offshore accounts in jersey ** . 
  ( karim benzema however is a good citizen who pays his taxes . 
  this is especially worthy of interest for french people , since he has been heavily criticised - particularly before the euro championship ) . 
  i do n't know about you guys , but here in france , i feel like these football leaks are not getting a lot of attention ( ... coincidence ( ? 
  ) : the french newspaper that publishes them is m\u00e9diapart ... they are excellent journalists , but whenever they reveal something , their colleagues are n't really eager to cover it ... what a shame ) . 
  anyway , waiting for more revelations to come ( prostitution i heard ... um um , what a surprise !, 
  i 'm ready to be appalled ) .
