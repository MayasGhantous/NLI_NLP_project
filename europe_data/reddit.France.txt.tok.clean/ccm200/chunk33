  - ** heavy pollution in paris and other cities . 
  ** i think that 's it for this week . 
  oh no : one `` minor '' other thing . 
  emmanuel macron ( former economy minister , who `` betrayed '' hollande this summer and announced his candidacy as the `` modern , neither right-wing nor left-wing ` progressive ' '' ) held his first big rally in paris yesterday . 
  and ... 
  i still do n't like the guy . 
  look . 
  [ that ] ( https://twitter.com/malaisetele/status/807643374622674944 ) ( journalists are covering this saying he was `` enthused '' , he `` showed his muscles '' ... 
  i mean had it been a `` far-left '' candidate they would have had a totally different story : `` populist !, 
  i think with any other candidate they would have mocked it , but with emmanuel , no problem : `` it 's not cringy at all , what are you talking about ?! '' ... 
  um ... . ( but to be fair many people showed up , and the polls are good for him . 
  we 'll see if the sudden mediatically filled `` bubble '' will burst , or not . ), 
  well i think most people were like me : when he appeared on tv to ( finally ) announce his decision , i genuinely did n't know what to expect . 
  ( he spent 10 minutes `` praising '' himself - his legacy - so i was like : `` apparently sounds like he 's going to say he wants to run again at the end ? 
  '' , but his tone was very solemn and gradually his emotions were apparent so i sensed maybe he would not , even though i still was n't sure what he would say ) . 
  most french people have been `` over him '' for months . 
  everyone was saying he had no chance and it was the only pragmatic solution . 
  but on the other hand , it took him so long to finally decide ( many of his allies and valls had been pressuring him for months and months ) , many parisian journalists - in their bubble - were saying he would definitely be running again , for egoistic reasons , for the love of power . 
  well maybe they were n't that wrong : he 's a very mysterious man who does n't reveal his intentions and true ideas even to his closest political allies . 
  so i think it 's quite possible that without valls pressuring him publicly the week before , he would have taken the opposite route . 
  the guy lives in his own reality and was apparently convinced he had his chances . 
  - ** president fran\u00e7ois hollande announced that he wo n't seek a second term . 
  ** after months of suspense and speculations ( most `` experts '' on tv were saying he would probably be running again ) , he * finally * announced his decision on thursday . 
  now we are waiting ( again ) for prime minister manuel valls to let us know whether he intends to replace him and be one of the candidates for the left-wing primary . 
  the left-wing primary will be held in january ( 22nd and 29th ) . 
  all candidates must be declared by the 15th of december . 
  we thought valls would announce his candidacy yesterday ( saturday ) , during a convention that was held about that , but ... he did n't even show up . 
  ( how nice of him , so respectful of his supporters and of the people . 
  idk , maybe he is waiting a few days because he thinks it 's more polite towards hollande ( ? 
  ) , or maybe he likes to make us wait , he enjoys the power he has now that he 's calling the shots ... ) he will likely announce it very shortly , there 's little doubt about his intentions , but i 'm wondering what he 's waiting for since he did an interview a week ago to explain he was ready/getting prepared . 
  ( also : if he does run , will he resign ? 
  maybe hollande asked him to wait while he prepares his new government , idk , he already has had a few days to plan this out ) . 
  in case you 're wondering about the other candidates to this primary : i prefer not to list them this week , because for now nothing is certain , we 'll see on the 15th . 
  other than that , nothing major i think . 
  it 's the weekend of the t\u00e9l\u00e9thon ( fundraising to help the reasearch against rare diseases ) ... and a band ( of kids ) asked the audience to `` stand up ! '', 
  ( many are in weelchairs so ... ) . 
  it already happened a few years ago and it was an adult singer that time . 
  ooops . 
  oh i 'll be blamed too . 
  but i already did my part in past elections , enough is enough . 
  most electors said they picked their candidate/changed their minds in the very last days ( before the 1st round ) , after watching the last ( or last 2 ) debates . 
  yes i was basically asking whether things seem to already be `` set in stone '' or if it 's still way too early to tell ( since in france it 's such a mess ) . 
  i do agree with you : if it 's fillon vs le pen or hollande vs le pen , i 'll be voting blank and maybe this will de facto `` help '' le pen win , i do think it 's a possibility . 
  but i wo n't feel guilty . 
  so in that sense , yes it 's similar to the us situation . 
  but there are still many aspects that make it difficult to predict : most `` experts '' ( note the '' '' ) say that french people would still `` vote for a candidate they despise against a candidate they hate '' . 
  it happened in 2002 : chirac won with 82 % of the votes . 
  even if i 'm convinced electors wo n't be as `` docile '' as 15 years ago , i 'm not sure the % will have changed that much ; it will objectively be difficult for her to get more than 50 % , even if it 's possible imo . 
   we had 5 candidates . 
  my understanding is that you 've got the republicans and the socialists , then national front , and every other party is about as significant as our greens and libertarians . 
  we have fillon for the republicans , marine le pen for the national front . 
  then on the left it 's really difficult to say : it will depend on how the campaign for the left-wing primary goes , it is * really * open right now ( a candidate from the left of the party is likely to win and then we 'll see how the party gets behind him or not ) . 
  but there are other candidates : mainly jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon for the `` far-left '' who is doing quite well in the polls right now . 
  and emmanuel macron is also a big question mark . 
  so i would personally ( at this stage ) mention 4 main candidates : fillon , le pen , the future socialist party candidate and jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon . 
  ( and then there are many other smaller candidates , which means that the main left-wing candidate will indeed have trouble getting enough votes to reach the second round ) . 
  but it 's still too early to give definite predictions . 
  i agree with your other replies to my previous comment ... but i also stand by what i said . 
  you 're not wrong , i agree with your analysis , but i think we have to be careful when comparing trump , the brexit and the french presidential campaign . 
  ( another thing i forgot to mention earlier is the turnout : it 's much higher in france . 
  i do believe the abstention may be higher this time - and many electors might opt for a blank vote , with the same effect , sadly - but this aspect might be important and may well be what makes our election different from the outcome you saw in the us ) . 
  there are similarities , but also many differences : popular vote = / = electoral college . 
  many ( arguably small ) candidates = / = bipartism system . 
  marine le pen is considered far-right by most people = / = trump was perceived as a republican . 
  marine le pen is ( more ) presidential = / = trump 's attitude ( i do n't even know what adjective to use anymore to sum it up ) . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon ( or alain jupp\u00e9 ) = / = clinton . 
  the number of religious fanatics is much much lower . 
  new terrorist attacks likely to happen during the campaign . 
  ( more so than in the us ) . 
  so do you think it will be a binary race between merkel and schulz , or is it probable but too early to predict ? 
  and how has martin schulz 's announcement been received ? 
  there are similarities indeed . 
  but they also differ . 
  for now i , personally , do n't really know what to think about it ( i feel like i do n't have a clear picture of what their plans are ) . 
  when they both debate this topic maybe it 'll be clearer . 
  honestly , i do n't know . 
  i could reply and give my perspective , but it would be speculative , i honestly do n't really know , maybe in a few months ( when all candidates talk about it during the presidential campaign ) we 'll have a slightly clearer idea . 
  for now i personally could n't really give you a good answer . 
  interesting timing ... has this ( the fact that this is emerging right after sarkozy 's defeat ) been commented ? 
  what 's the `` official '' answer ? 
  ( i had not heard , french journalists have been too busy covering the end of the primary campaign ) . 
  ** france ** - ** today is the second round of the centre-right primary election ** : fran\u00e7ois fillon is leading in the polls . 
  ** edit : fran\u00e7ois fillon won . 
  he 'll be the candidate for the right-wing `` les r\u00e9publicains '' party in may . 
  ** last sunday nicolas sarkozy came third . 
  right-wing electors are left with fran\u00e7ois fillon and alain jupp\u00e9 . 
  fillon has a pretty good lead and did well in the last debate this thursday . 
  ( and i ca n't be bothered to detail their programs . 
  google it  - ** ( on the left : hollande will probably - finally ! - announce this week whether he wants to run again or not ) . 
  ** after months and months , we 'll finally get a clearer picture of what the presidential campaign may look like . 
  rumors ( from journalists and `` experts '' ) say that he 'll make the announcement next thursday . 
  they say hollande will very likely run for a second term . 
  but remember that he has to take part in the left-wing primary ( at the end of january ) and he may well be humiliated . 
  ( all candidates must be declared mid december , so he still has the week after this one , but `` experts '' say he 'll decide as soon as the right-wing primary is over ) . 
  hollande always said his candidacy would depend on 2 main things / that he would not run again if : - he did not succeed in reversing the unemployment trend . 
  well it depends on how you look at it : the figures from the very last few months are better , but overall the number of unemployed people has increased since 2012 . 
  - he knew he would be humiliated . 
  well : `` sources '' say he feels confident , but his popularity is very very low and basically the whole nation is already over him and is convinced he will get crushed . 
  i really do n't know what he 'll decide and i 'm impatient to find out . 
  he still has a few close supporters who remained faithful , but honestly things could n't really be worse .
