  many socialists have been pressuring him for months ( not to run again ) , many have been vocal about it . 
  the consensus amongst them is that prime minister manuel valls should be running instead of hollande . 
  it is clear that valls has this ambition ( but a ) he does n't want to `` betray '' him , it would look bad for him , b ) he knows his chances are not that much better than hollande 's , so he may be thinking it 's best for him to wait a few years ) . 
  i ca n't help thinking a `` plot twist '' may be under way ( maybe hollande refusing to take part in the primary , even if it would , on paper , look extremely bad . 
  i do n't know , i feel like he 's capable of doing something like that . 
  or valls announcing his candidacy too , which would look pretty bad as well - the president and his pm becoming opponents - but , i do n't know , who knows what 's happening inside the party , there are a lot of people pressuring one another ) . 
  ( edit : in an interview today , pm manuel valls said he 's `` getting prepared '' , whatever that means : pressuring hollande once again so that he drops out and lets him - valls - represent the government in the primary ... or maybe it means he 'll be announcing a candidacy even later than that ... once hollande loses bigly in january and that a leftist wins the primary . ), 
  ( and yes : apart from hollande , there are already several declared candidates for this primary : 9 already - some may drop out , others may join the race ) . 
  - ** terrorist attack foiled . 
  ** 7 men were arrested last weekend in strasbourg ( north ) and marseille ( south ) . 
  5 are still in custody . 
  they were planning an imminent attack ( or several coordinated attacks ? ), 
  in paris ( planned for next thursday ) . 
  one is moroccan , living in portugal , where he was identified as radicalized ( was arrested in marseille ) . 
  investigations so far have shown that he did not have direct contact with the 4 others , but they all were in contact with a french-speaking man giving orders from syria or iraq . 
  the 4 others are french and childhood friends living in strasbourg . 
  their profiles are ` troubling ' : they are older than the other recent terrorists we 've seen ( in their thirties ) , they were unknown from the intelligent services , even though 2 of them went to turkey in 2015 - and may well have crossed the border with syria . 
  ( they flew to cyprus and then reached turkey by boat , whereas other jihadists apparently fly or drive directly to istambul , and are under the radar of the intelligent services . 
  they only stayed a few days ... supposedly to meet this isis guy operating online ? ) . 
  only 2 had a police record and the news about their arrests surprised their colleagues/realtives ( i know we always read this , but it seems that for these guys it 's particularly true : their radicalization really was a shock to everyone , 1 even worked in a primary school where everyone apparently liked him . . but he 's one of the 2 who went to turkey and evidence of allegiance to isis was found in his home ) . 
  apparently , this group was somehow linked ( financially ? ), 
  to another group of jihadists arrested in june ( just before the uefa euro competition ) . 
  no clear `` target '' has been identified , or more specifically , investigations have shown that they used google maps to research about 20 parisians touristic sites ( disneyland , religious monuments , the champs elys\u00e9es , the headquarters of the intelligence services , etc. . ) -------------------------------------------------------------------- - ** a woman was stabbed to death in a retirement home for monks ** you 've probably heard about it . 
  so it was not a terrorist attack after all . 
  the man has been arrested and apparently confessed , but he still has n't explained what his motivations were . 
  he did work at the retirement 10 years ago and knew the victim . 
  he 's been described as a solitary man who spends his time playing video games and who is depressed ... ( he has 2 kids ) . 
  - ** a couple was judged for killing a 5 year-old little girl in 2013 . 
  ** in 2013 , a woman claimed that her 5 year-old daughter fiona went missing ( was kidnapped ) while she fell asleep in a park . 
  she later confessed to lying and admitted the girl had died . 
  her and the step dad admitted they were drug addicts and the child had died from an `` accident '' at home that they tried to cover up . 
  they said they buried her body in the woods but it was never found ( they claim they ca n't remember the exact location ) . 
  after 10 days of trial , the advocate general pleaded for a 30 years sentence for both . 
  the jury opted ( to everyone 's surprise ) for 20 years for the step dad ( who they consider to be the murderer ) and only 5 years for the mother ( only culprit in their eyes of failure to provide assistance to a person in danger ) . 
  an appeal has been made , there will be another trial . 
  - ** british photographer david hamilton was found dead yesterday ( after a probable suicide ) . 
  4 women had accused him of rape earlier this month . 
  ** tv and radio presenter flavie flament published a book a few weeks ago in which she revealed being raped by an internationally famous photographer when she was 13 . 
  quickly hamilton 's name was printed in the media . 
  he denied the accusations and threatened to sue . 
  3 other former models contacted flavie flament with very similar stories of being raped when they were about 13 . 
  his body was found in his paris apartment yesterday . 
  ( the limit is 20 years after the victim 's majority , so i think it was too late for all these women ) . 
  - ** conservative mayors have banned aids campaign posters to `` protect the children '' . 
  ** [ 2 men not even kissing ] ( http://www.breizh-info.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sexe_hommes_touraine.jpg ) , what will we tell our kids ?!, 
  blah , blah , blah . 
  i 'm tired of this shit . 
  but you know , muslims are the only problem in france ( says fran\u00e7ois fillon , who is counting on the - mostly catholics - anti-gay marriage protesters to win the primary and the presidency ) . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  yes , i 've always been part of those who said that she ( marine le pen ) might actually win the presidency , contrary to what most people say . 
  however , seeing the result of tonight 's primary , i think it will be harder for her : fran\u00e7ois fillon has this image of a serious and responsable man . 
  i think most electors will not hesitate to vote for him to counter the national front ( even if i wo n't be part of those electors : i 'll be voting blank ... unless of course a left-wing candidate i like magically manages to reach the second round ) . 
  whereas if it had been sarkozy : a lot of electors from all tendencies would n't have voted for him and if it had been jupp\u00e9 : a substancial number of right-wing voters would probably have voted for mlp or opted for the blank vote ( i think ) . 
  ** france ** politics : - ** today is the first round of the centre-right presidential primary ** : fillon , jupp\u00e9 and sarkozy are really close in the polls . 
  _____________________________________________________________ ** edit : francois fillon and alain juppe won , sarkozy is out . 
  ** ( details of the results - not definitive yet , but the outcome wo n't change : fillon = 44,1 % ; jupp\u00e9 = 28,2 % ; sarkozy = 21 % ; nkm = 2,5 % ; blm = 2,5 % ; poisson = 1,4 % : cop\u00e9 = 0,3 % ) . 
  voters : close to 4 millions . 
  ______________________________________________________________ ** the winner of this primary is likely to be our next president ** ( * at this stage * : obviously many things can happen in the next 6 months , but he 's likely to be opposed to marine le pen - of the national front - in may and to win the election ) . 
  ** the second round will be next sunday ** : people will decide between the two candidates leading tonight . 
  ** during most of the campaign , alain jupp\u00e9 was leading pretty favorably in the polls but things changed this week : now he , fran\u00e7ois fillon and nicolas sarkozy are all credited of about 30 % ** of the voting intentions ( with fillon leading by 1 % , which was the surprise of the week ) . 
  so , there are 7 candidates : - fran\u00e7ois fillon : former prime minister , under sarkozy . 
  his program is the most liberal one . 
  he saw a late surge in the polls this week , apparently because people consider he 's the most serious one , who knows his shit and prepared well . 
  he led a very right-leaning campaign , centered around `` identity '' , immigration and security issues . 
  he is the favourite amongst `` les r\u00e9publicains '' members ( but they are n't the only ones voting ) . 
  - alain jupp\u00e9 : former prime minister under chirac . 
  he campaigned as a unifying figure and refused to take part in the fear-mongering tendencies of his party . 
  he is the oldest ( 71 ) . 
  if many non-right-wing electors decide to vote ( to counter sarkozy ) , he has a chance . 
  - bruno le maire : former agriculture minister under sarkozy . 
  he is younger and campaigned on the idea of renewing the political landscape , but he did n't succeed : he suffers from a technocratic , `` scholarly '' image and was n't very good during the debates . 
  - nathalie kosciusko-morizet : former environment minister under sarkozy . 
  she 's the only woman in this primary and also the youngest candidate . 
  according to many people , she 's the one with the most modern approach ( but imo she really was n't that good during the debates ) . 
  - jean-fran\u00e7ois cop\u00e9 : the last one in the polls . 
  he never had a chance , everybody hates him . 
  - jean-fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric poisson : candidate for the christian democratic party ( all the others are affiliated with the main right-wing party `` les r\u00e9publicains '' ) . 
  he 's against gay marriage . 
  ( i thought he was really quite good during the debates , even though i do n't like his ideas ) . 
  all things considered , ** there are n't a lot of differences in their programs ** : they are all * very * liberal economically and the very right-leaning tendency on social issues contaminated the whole party . 
  ** electors are probably going to decide based on the candidates ' personalities ** . 
  ** it 's the first time a primary is organized by the conservative party , which means it is difficult to predict how many voters will turn up ** . 
  according to the `` experts '' , if the number is small it will be good for sarkozy ( since it will mean the most hard-core members of the `` les r\u00e9publicains '' party will decide ) . 
  if more people take part , then it will be favorable to jupp\u00e9 or fillon . 
  left-wing electors are tempted to participate , since things are looking very bad for the left in may ( which means they feel encouraged/entitled/tempted to vote in this primary , since at this stage it looks like it will basically decide already who will be our next president ) . 
  difficult to predict : the 3 televised debates were quite successful - more than 5 million people following the 1st and last one . 
  ( one important aspect is the weather : it 's not good today , so maybe people wo n't bother going out ) . 
  final point : in november 2012 , the `` ump '' party had an election to choose its president . 
  it resulted in a major crisis because of the fraud ( it was hilarious : the 2 candidates - fillon and cop\u00e9 - appeared on tv around midnight , both claiming to have won ) . 
  obviously they all know a second similar episode would be disastrous but there 's a possiblity it would happen again . 
  - ** a french-lebanese businessman said this week that he delivered three suitcases from libya , containing 5 million euros in cash , to sarkozy and his former chief of staff and campaign director , in illegal campaign financing from libyan dictator muammar gaddafi , in 2006 and 2007 ** . 
  ( serious ) online investigation newspaper m\u00e9diapart has been covering this story since 2012 . 
  they published new details about the investigation ( launched in 2013 ) last months and evidence is starting to really accumulate . 
  but the mainstream media is barely covering it , arguing that at this point it 's not enough . 
  - ** emmanuel macron ( finally ) announced his candidacy for next year 's presidential election ** . 
  he 's young and very well liked by the media , but this candidacy was heavily criticized . 
  he still has n't announced what his program is !, 
  there is still nothing substancial on his website : he runs on the idea of being a young modern new type of politician , neither right-wing nor left-wing , a progressive who wants to modernize the political system . 
  he was unknown 2 years ago and , after being hollande 's adviser , he was appointed minister of the economy before he `` betrayed '' him this summer when he resigned to launch an individual bid . 
  when regularly interviewed by a `` the daily show '' type of journalist last year , he appeared very modern , in sharp contrast with other politicians ( think obama : he was * a bit * like that in the way he answered ) .
