  but now he 's completely changed !, 
  he speaks slowly , as if he thinks that 's what makes him look presidential , solemn and serious . 
  the ( rare ) politicians who support him ( at this stage : others might join depending how well he does from now on ) are all very old . 
  imo he lost the appeal he had and his attitude no longer matches the narrative he 's selling . 
  i do n't get it . 
  he now seems young and not prepared enough , as oposed to fresh , dynamic and modern . 
  he says he 's a `` progressive '' : economically and socially liberal . 
  but , as i said , he still has n't explained what his program is ( this summer he was saying that he would reveal what his concrete propositions are once the decision to go or not was made : well , now we 're there and still nothing ) . 
  so , as you have understood , i do n't like the guy and i agree : it 's all a facade . 
  - ** marine le pen revealed her new logo for the upcoming campaign , in ongoing efforts to `` dedemonize '' her party ** . 
  the new logo is [ a blue rose ] ( https://www.franceinter.fr/cruiser-production/2016/11/fba22045-502e-45a1-9ebc-09ee9ff1d1e9/640_rose_bleue_front_national_gettyimages-623636792.jpg.pagespeed.ce.1b6o8wn73j.jpg ) , which she says represents `` making the impossible possible '' . 
  ( the french socialist party logo is a red rose , the french conservative party colour is blue ) . 
  her last name disappeared from the party 's flyers years ago already , as well as the former logo of the national front ( [ a blue , white and red flame ] ( http://www.slate.fr/sites/default/files/photos/logo_front_national.png ) ) and the party name : she goes with `` marine pr\u00e9sidente '' only ( thinking we are dumb ) . 
  she also used this new logo in several images , amongst which a [ banksy tag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4yduewg.jpg ) ( !, 
  ... banksy is politically the opposite of her ... she has no shame ) as well as other images taken from the pop culture iconography , so as to appear young and cool : [ clint eastwood ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wq8k8hz.jpg ) ( okay , this one i understand ) , famous french movie [ les tontons flingueurs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ee0pxru.jpg ) , or [ the rolling stones ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wwklq27l.jpg ) . 
  - ** 60 `` celebrities '' signed a tribune to call for the end of the `` hollande bashing '' ** . 
  ... 10 days after trump 's victory , did they really think it was a good idea ? 
  ----------------------------------------------------- - ** after a month , journalists of news channel i-t\u00e9l\u00e9 ended their strike : they got nothing ** . 
  more than 1/3rd of the employees resigned . 
  - ** french and esa astronaut thomas pesquet arrived at the international space station yesterday ** . 
  - ** 3 cancer patients died suspiciously in a hospital ** and i think 2 others underwent complications . 
  investigations are ongoing at the moment , we do n't know what caused it . 
  - ** parents wanting to name their newborn baby `` mohamed merah '' may have to find another idea ** . 
  mohamed merah is the name of a terrorist who killed 3 soldiers , a jewish teacher and 3 young jewish children in 2012 in toulouse . 
  this brings interesting questions : mohamed is a popular name for muslim families , it 's not their fault if their last name is the same as his , but for the good of the child is it a smart idea ? 
  if you are looking for a nice movie to watch , then [ le pr\u00e9nom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqjh8gorypq ) is really good ( do n't read too much about it , otherwise there 's no point , trust me it 's good , although this teaser is n't ) . 
  you 'll be happy to learn that he was released !, 
  i see , i did misinterpret . 
  yes , complex issue , i know the law in france is different but it 's such a complicated topic that i could n't even explain how it exactly works ... 
  the last one is quite surprising to me . 
  i would never expect french catholic leaders to campaign for this . 
   a fireman was caught starting fires in sicilly . 
  makes sense actually , it 's not an isolated case ( pyromaniacs becoming firemen to satisfy their fascination ) . 
  is this interpretated as a purely internal thing , or is it also partly addressed to trump ? 
  france : - ** we 're currently 3rd in the london athletics world championships !, 
  ** behind the usa and kenya . 
  ( we were 10th yesterday , but got 2 more gold medals yesterday evening - decathlon - and today -50 km walk . 
  we had another gold earlier this week -800 m - and a bronze medal ) . 
  not bad . 
  and we may get another one this evening , maybe ? 
  congratulations to the other european nations currently ranking at the top of the medal table : poland ( 4rth ) , great britain ( 5th ) , germany ( 10th ) ... and all the others . 
  and thanks london , it was great to watch once again , like five years ago , and last month for the para athletics ( first time i watched extensively and it was great as well ) . 
  top notch audience and mascot  - ** a man ploughed into 6 soldiers in a town near paris ** . 
  3 of them were seriously injured ( non lethal injuries ) . 
  the suspect was caught on the highway and is still being treated in the hospital because he was shot 5 times ( including in his spine ) , so he has not been interrogated yet . 
  he is an algerian citizen , living legally in france , who was not known by the intelligence services ( not identified as a potential radical islamist or with connections to jihadists ) and he did n't have any criminal record . 
  but his action seemed deliberate and the case is being treated as terrorism . 
  ( this led to , yet again , a small debate about whether the `` sentinelle '' operation - soldiers being stationed near touristic monuments and religious sites or schools - is useful or not - besides reassuring the general public ) . 
  - ** more fires ** . 
  and a young man confessed 8 of the 16 fires he was accused of , that happened earlier this summer . 
  - ** the contaminated eggs have made their way to france this week ** . 
  ( we were n't affected as of last week ) . 
  - ** airbnb in the spotlight ** . 
  for being a shitty company ... you know the deal . 
  and also similar articles about another start-up : one that exploits their cyclist employees who deliver meals . 
  - the president , government and mps are on holiday . 
  ( next week , i may have to report on a controversy related to islam , burkinis , halal food , women 's rights ... this is usually what editorialists and journalists feed us in the summer when they have nothing to talk about politically . 
  there have been a few attempts this summer but nothing juicy enough to generate enough national outrage and intense debates . 
  this is all too quiet . 
  it 's not normal ) . 
  i think that 's all . 
  france : - ** actress jeanne moreau died at 89 ** . 
  [ she ] ( https://www.rts.ch/2014/04/22/14/59/5791411.image ) worked with [ louis malle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icjw9hxxoxa ) , fran\u00e7ois truffaut , jacques demy , michelangelo antonioni , luis bunuel , orson welles ... - ** neymar signed with psg ** . 
  and it was on the news all week !!!, 
  stop it !, 
  i do n't give a ... !, 
  - ** paris will host the olympic games in 2024 ** . 
  hurray !, 
  we won because we were the only contenders ( with los angeles ) . 
  well it 's not `` official '' yet but that 's it . 
  the corruption can begin/continue . 
  - ** high temperatures and many fires ** . 
  france politics : - ** the chief of staff of the armed forces , general de villiers , quit ** . 
  he complained about the cuts in the defense budget in front of the ( closed-door ) commission of the national assembly . 
  his remarks were leaked to the press ( by some mps i assume . 
  which ones ? 
  from the opposition i assume ) . 
  he was ` put in his place ' by emmanuel macron on the 13th of july ( right before the military parade of bastille day ) who said `` i 'm your boss , you should n't express yourself publicly about this '' . 
  this was not received well : many military members felt it was a public humiliation of their boss . 
  as a result , general de villiers resigned this week and was replaced . 
  this controversy is probably the biggest macron has had to face so far , but it was not as big as what i had imagined , we talked about it for two days and that 's it . 
  - ** the government is making cuts in the housing benefits , as well as in the budget of the secretary of state for the equality between women and men ** . 
  the housing benefits concern lower-class students and families . 
  they will lose 5 euros per month . 
  the cuts will allegedly serve to fund the building of new low-price housing . 
  the secretary of state in charge of the equality between men and women will have its budget decreased by 25/27 % . 
  it funds plenty of associations helping victims of sexual discriminations and/or violence . 
  ( this news leaked in the press and the secretary of state called it `` fake news '' , but apparently the journalists were right ) . 
  ( prior to that , the government had also announced cuts in the education & research as well as in the justice budgets ) . 
  - ** the unions are worried about the labour reform ** . 
  of course the most left-leaning trade unions had already been vocal about the new labour reform the government worked on in the national assembly this month . 
  but now even the most `` macron-friendly '' ones are beginning to express criticism . 
  the bill will return to the assembly in late august/early september ( where it will pass since there is no opposition due to macron 's party extra-large majority ) . 
  so there will be social protests in the streets , but how big will they be and how strongly will the government ( its interior ministry ) react ? 
  too early to tell . 
  - ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , leader of the ` far-left ' party `` fi '' , is suspected of having hired fake european assistants ** . 
  this is linked to the case about marine le pen and her national front party illegal meps assistants . 
  they hired fake parliamentary assistants who were supposed to be working in brussels but who were in fact working in paris , for the party ( including for instance marine le pen 's bodyguard ) . 
  after this was revealed , a national front mep said `` hey but we 're not the only ones doing it , why are you targeting only us ?? '', 
  and gave informations about the centrist party `` modem '' ( a macron ally ; and macron had to fire 3 of his newly hired ministers because of it : they were members of this modem party ) .
