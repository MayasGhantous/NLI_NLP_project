  and so this week , it was jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon 's turn . 
  same thing : the national front mep accused him of the same thing , having hired european parliamentary assistants who were in fact working for his party in paris ( he was a mep until last year . 
  he now is a french mp ) . 
  but m\u00e9lenchon denies any wrongdoing and said he 'll file a deffamation complaint . 
  so we 'll see how it goes ... - ** the national front leaders met for an ` inventory ' of their defeat in the presidential election ** . 
  3 main issues were likely discussed : 1 ) is marine le pen still ` presidential ' ? 
  ( after her defeat and especially her really bad performance during the debate against macron , which failed to impress even their electors ) --  apparently they officialy say everything is good , no internal rivalries over this , marine is still the leader ( there is n't anyone else credible at the moment tbf ) ; 2 ) should they change their name ? 
  ( the `` national front '' name in itself scares a lot of potential electors ) . 
  --  no update on this ; 3 ) should leaving the euro currency remain on their program ? 
  ( which was considered to be the other main obstacle to convincing enough voters ) --  if i understood correctly , they now say it stays on their program but is n't a central measure anymore : if they reach power they will consider it at the end of their mandate . 
  --  their members will be asked to vote on a series on questions regarding both the party platform and its organization in september . 
  they will then have a big conference at the beginning of next year . 
  ( the socialist party would be advised to do the same ... but hey they want to bury themselves it seems ) . 
  - ** new rule in the national assembly : ties and jackets are no longer mandatory ** . 
  there was a mild controversy last month when `` fi '' ( ` far-left ' ) mps turned up without wearing a tie . 
  it was decided that the assembly needs to modernize itself and that the tie is no longer required . 
  other news : - ** a march was organized to commemorate the death of adama traor\u00e9 , a young black man who was killed by the police one year ago ** . 
  this has regularly been making the news in france for a year . 
  at first the police and the judge claimed he died because of a pre-existing cardiac condition . 
  which the family never bought . 
  further ( independent ) autopsies revealed ( oh surprise ! ), 
  that he had in fact died due to asphyxiation . 
  the 3 policemen who jumped on him and did n't release their pressure when he said he could n't breathe , and who waited before calling the ambulance , still have n't been prosecuted . 
  - ** today is the final stage of the tour de france ** . 
  froome is leading . 
  - ** the ministry of culture twitter account was `` hacked '' ... by a teenager ** . 
  it was n't exactly hacked : the son of the community manager likely found his mother 's computer and sent dozens of stupid and sexist tweets from 1 to 5 am ... ( he tweeted people his age and maybe somewhat famous french twittos : ( un ? 
  ) fortunately he did n't tweet anything to donald trump or any other major political figure ) . 
  france - ** donald trump was the guest of honor for the 14th of july/bastille day celebrations ** . 
  because this year marked the 100th anniversary of the entry of us soldiers in wwi . 
  ( i assume you all read about this already so i wo n't expand ) . 
  - ** we also commemorated the victims of the terrorist attack in nice , last year ** . 
  86 people died last year , including many children . 
  there was a controversy because a magazine ( paris match ) had the great idea to publish pictures showing the scene and the deceased terrorist in this week 's issue . 
  - ** benjamin netanyahu is the guest of honor for today 's commemorations of the vel d'hiv roundup ** . 
  there 's a controversy over this as well , since this was franco-french event : * french * policemen ( not german nazis ) rounded up thousands of jews ( 1/3 were children ) inside the `` v\u00e9lodrome d'hiver '' in paris and they were then deported . 
  so inviting netanyahu is both a kind of denial of france 's responsability/guilt as well as a way of treating israel as * the * country of jewish people . 
  ( but when i say `` controversy '' , it 's very tame . 
  as usual with macron , he can do no wrong , still ) . 
  - ** the army chief , general de villiers , is threatening to quit ** . 
  a few days before the 14th of july ... the government announced they would lower the defense budget . 
  not a good timing at all , and this is not what was promised , at all . 
  so the general complained in pretty harsh terms and his remarks were made public ( i 'm not even sure who leaked it : if the general wanted it to leak so as to pressure macron publicly , or if it 's a politician who told a journalist ... ) so on the 13rth ( after greeting trump and before going to the eat with him in the eiffel tower ) macron gave a speech from the ministry of defense building and refused to hear the general 's complaints . 
  he basically said `` i 'm your chief , you do not get to publicly criticize me '' . 
  this was not well received by many people in the military , who felt it was a public humiliation of their general who they think was legitimately trying to defend them . 
  it looks like the general is about to quit , for real . 
  it would be the first major controversy for macron ( and , given the topic and the context - terrorism & french soldiers at war abroad - it will probably be hard to fix ... 
  right-wing people are usually better at getting the media 's attention . 
  and , i mean , they 're not wrong here ) . 
  edit : oh i forgot to say that the defense budget is n't the only one that is reduced . 
  they are also targeting the education and justice budgets , but these ones did n't complain publicly . 
  maybe it will come ( and it 's a shame for both , but our judicial system has been in disarray for years and years , compared to other european countries . 
  i do n't know how they can possibly handle it seeing what they work conditions already are ... see final bullet-point : i would n't be surprised to see that the number of suicides starts to explode amongst judges/prosecutors soon ) . 
  - ** the initial works in the assembly to pass the new labour reform are over ** . 
  the lrem mps ( macron 's party ) can do whatever they want since there is no opposition . 
  so it passed without even getting much media attention . 
  we 'll see how it goes in late august/early september when the actual bill will be voted ( and passed ) : then maybe there will be some protests ( of course right now people are on holiday and not paying attention to politics , especially after a long election period , that 's why the government opted for this timing ) . 
  - ** the law of `` moralization of politics '' is also being discussed ** . 
  this is a law in response to fran\u00e7ois fillon 's `` penelope gate '' scandal , during the campaign . 
  it includes many things , but mainly a new rule to forbid mps from hiring a family member ( it was legal until now ... 
  hiring them for fake jobs was already illegal of course , but as we 've seen it was was n't regulated that much ... ) . 
  - ** little gr\u00e9gory `` cold case '' : the former judge commits suicide ** . 
  a few weeks ago i mentioned this extremely famous ( in france ) criminal case : over 30 years ago , a little boy named gr\u00e9gory was kidnapped and drowned in a river near his home , in a tiny village . 
  the culprit ( s ) was/ere never identified ( because everyone did an extremely bad job : the police , the judge , the journalists ) but it was always strongly suspected that it was a family member ( because the parents had been the target of nasty anonymous calls and letters , before and after the murder ) ... gr\u00e9gory 's dad killed the main suspect ( the suspect was temporarily put in jail but then released and the judge then accused the mother !, 
  who was totally innocent but nevertheless put in jail while pregnant with her second child after just losing her son ) . 
  so last month they `` reopened '' the case but they do n't seem to have new evidence . 
  ( they probably were counting on the fact that some family members who definiteky know what happened would betray themselves by calling each other to discuss the new placements under custody . 
  every family member 's phone was likely tapped , but i do n't think it worked ) . 
  and so , this week : new tragedy in this already disastrous case that has been going on for 3 decades . 
  the first judge to have worked on it committed suicide . 
  ( it 's likely he could n't handle hearing journalists going over the whole case again and criticizing him ) . 
  - ** a ` whistleblower ' who alerted on arcellor-mittal pouring acid in nature regrets testifying ** . 
  [ a truck driver employed by a subcontractor for arcellor-mittal alerted the media a few days/weeks ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ear17wvhyqe ) . 
  `` here 's how we recycle chemical products for arcelor : we pour it in the middle of nature . 
  it 's acid , 28 m ^ 3 a day . 
  the government asks us to buy ecological cars and not drive during pollution peaks , but the big companies can do whatever they want '' . 
  now no one wants to hire him . 
  ... - ** the ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ campaign in favour of france hosting the 2024 olympics continues ** . 
  it 's starting to feel a bit heavy-handed ... ( macron went to lausanne with the french team to , once again , defend our case against los angeles . 
  the media is helping them `` convince '' us ... any way we 'll get it , either in 2024 or 2028 . 
  oh yes , you 're right . 
  so we have 7 groups in the national assembly : - lrem ( la r\u00e9publique en marche ) , macron 's party : 314 mps - lr ( les r\u00e9publicains ) , right : 100 mps - modem ( mouvement d\u00e9mocrate ) , center : 47 - * les constructifs , lr , udi & independents : 35 * - ng ( nouvelle gauche ) , socialist party , left ( renamed themselves . . ) : 31 - fi ( france insoumise ) , ` far-left ' : 17 - gdr ( gauche d\u00e9mocrate et r\u00e9publicaine ) , communists mainly : 16 ( no national front group because you need 15 mps to be able to form a political group and they are only 8 ) . 
  the one you 're talking about is `` les constructifs '' . 
  ( so on top of this huge `` lrem '' group , the `` modem '' group and this `` les constructifs '' group are macron 's allies . 
  about 400 pro-government mps and less than 200 mps in the opposition groups ) . 
  ( you have no flair & did n't mention which country you 're talking about . 
  austria it seems ) . 
  france : - ** simone veil , one of the most respected french politicians , died . 
  she was an auschwitz survivor and best known for pushing forward the law legalizing abortion in 1975 ** . 
  ( there have been threads about it on this sub , so i do n't think i need to expand ) . 
  - ** ( news from last week : 4 ministers resigned . 
  ) ** i did n't comment on last week 's thread so i 'm putting it here . 
  i 'll make it short : 4 ministers had to resign due to 2 different embarrassing allegations against them or their party ... - ** emmanuel macron will be giving a `` state of the union '' speech before congress at versailles tomorrow , and it has caused criticism ** . 
  the president will be giving a general speech about the direction he wants for the country , in front of all the mps who are summoned at the palace of versailles . 
  the next day , his prime minister edouard philippe , will also be giving a similar speech at the national assembly . 
  ( this had been announced by macron during the campaign : he intends to convene congress once a year ) . 
  this was not applauded by everyone : the ` far-left ' ( fi ) and the communists mps announced they would boycott the event . 
  and it 's not just them : 2 center-right mps also wo n't take part . 
  why ? 
  because they see this as another way for macron to enforce a monarchical presidency .
