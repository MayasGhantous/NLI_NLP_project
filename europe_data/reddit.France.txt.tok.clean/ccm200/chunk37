  macron sees himself as a `` jupitarian '' president : he wants to appear strong and to renew with old standards . 
  according to the constitution , the president can convey the congress for 3 reasons : 1 ) to propose a change to the constitution 2 ) to accept the adhesion of a new country to the eu 3 ) to give an important speech . 
  this last option was used by both sarkozy and hollande once during their mandate , because they felt it was useful during a time of crisis : sarkozy did it in 2009 , to talk about the economic crisis , and hollande did it in 2015 , right after the paris attacks ( that 's when he proposed the infamous revocation of nationality law ) . 
  usually the prime minister is the one who gives a speech to the national assembly , to present his plans for the next months . 
  by giving a speech the day before , surrounded by the gold of the palace of versailles , macron is overshadowing his pm . 
  ( edouard philippe , our new pm , is quite unknown to the general public and he `` betrayed '' his party - right-wing party ` les r\u00e9publicains ' - by accepting the post . 
  therefore it seems that macron intends to maintain him at a safe distance . 
  but , in order to be effective , to have concrete power , the pm needs to be able to express himself , to have a voice ... ) macron won the presidency , his new party got an enormous majority in the assembly , this week they attributed top posts in the assembly to themselves ... um guys ??? 
  do n't ya think that 's enough ? 
  also it is very costly . 
  over 600 000 euros , according to the press . 
  ( tbh i do n't understand how it can be that expensive . 
  they need to secure the whole place , they serve food to the hundreds of mps ... okay but how can it add up to hundreds of thousands of euros ?? ), 
  - ** donald trump will be present for the bastille day ceremony on the 14th of july ** . 
  no controversy about this , contrary to what could have been expected . 
  ( maybe that will come , but when it was announced ` people ' - from what i 've seen on the media at least - overwingly seemed to be okay with it , saying that it 's not about trump but about the long history of friendship with the usa , especially since we will be honouring the 100th anniversary of america 's entry into wwi . 
  i mean , yes sure , but that should n't prevent us from voicing our opinions about him , imo . 
  especially since macron invited putin last month , in versailles , which i do n't think was very useful politically , it just serves his image of `` jupiter '' ) . 
  another thing , that fits with the last 2 bullet points : for over 40 years , the french president gave an annual interview on the 14th of july . 
  macron announced he would not comply with this tradition . 
  ( since he 's been elected he has given interviews to european journalists , but none in france . 
  the minister of labour filed a complaint about a leak in a major newspaper , the justice minister - who since had to resign - called the public radio to complain about their reporting on a sensitive corruption case about his party ... and macron 's spokespeople made several harsh comments about the press , last one this week being that macron 's thoughts are too `` complex '' therefore he does n't want to answer journalists on bastille day , like his predecessors ... um guys ?? 
  do n't ya think it 's starting to smell a little bit weird in here ? ), 
  - [ macron 's official portrait was published ] ( https://twitter.com/emmanuelmacron/status/880374825784619008 ) . 
  - ** there 's an embarrassing case building up about the minister of labour ** . 
  for now she seems to be okay , but maybe she too will have to resign and be replaced ... ( um um , do n't ya think it 's starting to be a little bit much ? 
  oh okay , my bad . 
  macron will fire her and we 'll have to say he shown great strength !, 
  oh well , he can never do anything wrong ! ), 
  what is it about ? 
  she was at the head of a public agency dealing with international investments and , when macron was still minister of the economy not long before he resigned to launch his campaign , said agency helped organize his visit to new york ( allegedly as part of his job as minister of the economy , but some suspect he went there to raise funds for his future campaign ) . 
  except they did n't follow the rules and chose a private company to organize it all ( which cost quite a lot of money ) instead of publishing a call for tender . 
  mind you this was uncovered during the campaign , so macron was well aware this could cause problems but he nevertheless chose her as one of his ministers . 
  she will be on the frontline in the very next days/weeks , because the labour reform is one of the key elements they want to pass as quickly as possible ( and remember , we had very big protests just one year ago , against the previous labour reform ... that macron crafted and that a majority of the population opposed.oh and yesterday she gave an interview during which she thought it would be clever to say that `` our labour code is meant to annoy 95 % of bussinesses '' ... meaning that 's the argument to reform it and deregulate ) . 
  - ** marine le pen was charged over the misuse of eu parliament funds ** . 
  i wo n't re-explain it since it came up many times during the campaign , but so that 's it , she 's finally formally charged , as expected . 
  - ** benoit hamon , socialist candidate to the presidency , launched his new political movement ** . 
  in an attempt to revigorate the left-wing offer ... ( not much to say about it tbh ... okay do your thing dude , good luck ... ) - ** former prime minister manuel valls ' victory during the legislative election is contested ** . 
     okay , we 'll see how it goes , there 's not a lot of chance that his victory could actually been cancelled . 
  but if it happens , kilos of pop corn will be required . 
  manuel valls , hollande 's interior minister and then prime minister , lost during the socialist party primary against benoit hamon . 
  that already was a huge blow . 
  after that , instead of respecting his own words ( and the actual document he * signed * , promising he would respect the will of the voters and support the winner ) , he supported macron . 
  but macron , knowing that manuel valls ' popularity is n't exactly good , was always very dismissive about valls ' eagerness to ` join ' him ( the camp of the future winner ) . 
  as a result , when valls was left with no better option but to run for mp ( a huge set back from his position as pm ) , the socialist party said `` um , nope , you 're not campaigning under our banner : you clearly stated you are on macron 's party 's side '' ... but macron 's party did n't want to endorse valls either . 
  so valls ran as an independent `` leftie '' . 
  and he won . 
  by 139 votes !, 
  = not much at all , to say the least . 
  before reaching the top places inside the governement , he had been a mayor and mp of that constituency for decades !, 
  you could have thought this would assure him of an easy win , despite his bad image . 
  but no , he won with a ridiculous margin . 
  and , immediately when the results were known , his opponent ( a ` far-left ' candidate for fi ) said she was very suspicious about the results and suspected a fraud . 
  this week she filed an official complaint . 
  unfortunately the results of the case will be known in several months . 
  and very few cases end up with the cancellation of the election . 
  ( she showed several elements she assembled to make her case and some are indeed troubling . 
  i wo n't expand , it 's long enough and you probably do n't care , but to us frenchies it 's really juicy , since he was our prime minister and is a very divisive politician a lot of people love to hate ) . 
  - ** should mps wear ties ? 
  it 's an important issue according to french pundits ** . 
  ` far-left ' mps did n't wear ties when they made their first entrance inside the national assembly . 
  that 's against the ( informal ) rules : normally all men need to wear one , and if they 've forgotten it they can be lended one before stepping inside . 
  they basically said they thought it was a bit stupid and retrograd , useless . 
  caused lots of ` debates ' from our editorialists and political journalists ( either saying it 's not respectful , and/or they are just doing it to cause a controversy and get screen time - well apparently it 's working , they know you well ...  sigh . 
  i think that 's it ? 
  i care !, 
  oh yes . 
  but i meant you will see other articles and probably a megathread about yet another important french election in a few months , it 's not over yet , 
  so the turnout is predicted to be at 42 % . 
  historically low ... 
  no , there wil be senatorial elections in september , 
  france : politics : - ** 2nd round of the legislative elections today : macron 's party is going to win the absolute majority ** . 
  - we are voting to elect our 577 national assembly members . 
  ( well 573 now since 4 have been elected during the first round : i.e they scored  50 % and the turnout in their constituency was high enough . 
  in 2012 , 36 candidates managed to get elected directly in the first round : the turnout rate was higher ) . 
  - last week 's results : lrem and modem ( macron and ally centrist party ) : 32 % lr and udi ( fillon , right-wing parties ) : 21,5 % fi and pcf ( jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon , `` far-left '' & communists allies ) : 13,7 % fn ( marine le pen , far-right ) : 13 % ps and prg ( socialist party & other left-wing allies ) : 9,5 % ecologists : 4 % others : a few % - the turnout rate was historically low last week for the first round , with 51 % of elligible voters who abstained . 
  it is predicted to be even higher today . 
  ( at noon it 's already 1,5 % higher than last week ) . 
  ( why ? 
  well 1 ) it 's always the case during legislative elections , compared to the presidential : people are n't educated enough about their importance ; 2 ) people are fed up with politics : the topic has been at the center of the news for months and months now ; 3 ) since our system is not proportional many people feel that it 's useless , ie : for instance far-left party `` fi '' and far-right party `` fn '' scored around 20 % last month during the 1st round of the presidential and around 12 % last week , yet they will end up with only a handful of mps totalizing about 1,5 % of the seats only , while lrem - macron 's party - will get around 77 % of the seats ... last week they scored 32 % and macron got 24 % during the first round of the presidential ; 4 ) there is n't much suspense : lrem has been predicted to win easily , there was n't much of a campaign ; 5 ) in the vast majority of constituencies lrem arrived first last week , in most cases they are against a lr candidate : if you 're not a centrist , nor a right-wing supporter , what do you do ? 
  i voted today , but blank . 
  i already know the lrem will candidate will win in my constituency , like in most places ) . 
  - results at 8pm tonight . 
  - [ recent poll projection ] ( http://img-4.linternaute.com/klvwxwemzfstzfgy3czp8nl4hok=/600x/smart/4160221b03d54ad2ac51adc78d517716/ccmcms-linternaute/10552451.jpg ) . 
  so lrem will get the absolute majority with much more than the 289 seats needed . 
  lr - right - will be the main opposition party . 
  it will be interesting to see whether fn ( far-right ) and fi ( `` far-left '' ) will manage to get at least 15 seats because that 's what you need to be able to form a group : i.e without a group you ca n't do much in the assembly : / . 
  it will also be important to see whether the leader of both parties will be elected ( marine le pen and jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon are candidating to have a powerful voice inside the assembly ... 
  if they do n't have a group and their leader is n't elected it will be a major defeat . 
  - ** last sunday a right-wing candidate reacting to his loss said that the electors of his constituency made him want to puke ** . 
  henri guaino is a former lr member . 
  he was one of sarkozy 's closest allies a few years back . 
  this year he tried to candidate as an independent right-winger for the presidential but did n't get enough elected politicians to back his candidacy . 
  last sunday he was candidating in a parisian constituency ( fillon 's former constituency actually ) , against a lr candidate . 
  lrem and that lr candidate were qualified . 
  on tv he said that half of the constituency are `` bobos '' ( = `` bourgeois boh\u00e8mes '' : it 's a term that is used kind of in the same way as `` hipsters '' , often by right-wingers who want to criticize the upper-middle class who have liberal views ) and the other half are hypocrit catholics who go to church every sunday but voted for fillon last month although he 's corrupt . 
  he then said they make him want to puke . 
  ( not a vey important event , but it 's connected to what follows  - ** a candidate was assaulted while campaigning ... the suspect is a mayor !, 
  ** nathalie kosciusko-morizet ( `` nkm '' ) , a lr candidate , was handing out flyers on a market when a man grabbed her flyers and sort of punched her in the face with them . 
  she fell and remained unconscious on the ground for 10 minutes before being sent to the hospital .
