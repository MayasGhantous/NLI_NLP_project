  the man fled away but some people were able to take pictures ( of him from behind , you ca n't see his face ) . 
  before assaulting her he allegedly yelled : '' ******* bobo !, 
  it 's your fault if anne hidalgo [ socialist ] is paris mayor , go back to your constituency ! '', 
  ( nkm , the lr candidate , is new to this constituency - it used to be fillon 's - so he was telling her she has no place to be candidating there . 
  she 's also on the more progressive side of the lr party - more sensitive to ecologist and feminist ideas than her pairs - hence why he apparently thought she was = the left-wing mayor of paris . 
  also worth noting that the two are female ... ) so he fled and two days later he received a summoning ( cause people identified him ) . 
  went to the police station but he denied the accusations , says it was n't him . 
  turns out he is n't even from that constituency , not even from paris , he 's from normandy and ... he 's a mayor ( of a small village ) !, 
  and guess who he supported a few months ago ? 
  henri guaino , from the previous newsstory : the politician who said last week that `` bobos '' make him want to puke . 
  ( this mayor also sent a letter to the interior minister 3 years ago , to complain about `` the intolerable insecurity '' in his village ) . 
  ( mind you henri guaino has been * strangely * spared from criticism since this event . 
  you would think journlists would connect the dots immediately and comment on his words from last sunday even before knowing the suspect 's motivations and political affiliations : right-winger ? 
  far-right skin head ? 
  ( guy is bald ) . 
  but no , even after the revelation of the man 's identity they did n't really criticize guaino too much . 
  who did pundits accuse ? 
  jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon of course , `` far-left '' leader who supposedly fuels this kind of violence with his rhetoric ... ) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- other news : - ** a 33 year-old cold case is back on the news ** . 
  this is one of the most famous french criminal cases . 
  33 years ago , a 4 year-old little boy ( gr\u00e9gory ) was kidnapped in front of his house and quickly found dead in a river a few kilometers away , his hands and feet tied up . 
  the family had been the target of nasty anonymous letters and phone calls before the murder , and it went on after ( the judge in charge of the case also receive death threats ) . 
  the case was never resolved , mostly due to bad work from the police from the start and also to journalists ( who basically behaved in the worst possible way ) . 
  it 's always been clear though that the culprit ( s ) were very probably inside the family . 
  yet there was n't enough evidence to know who exactly did it . 
  a family member was suspected before being released and the father of the kid killed him . 
  then the mom was suspected before being cleared . 
  lots of other `` episodes '' to this story , it was mediatized a lot . 
  this week 3 or 4 family members were arrested and interrogated again . 
  the great-uncle and great-aunt of gr\u00e9gory , and also his grandmother . 
  but actually there is nothing new ( unless the investigators left out key elements in the press conferences they gave ) and none of the suspects confessed . 
  so , honestly the suspects seem to have been part of the whole thing : lots of circumstancial elements accusing them . 
  but no clear evidence still ( all the dna tests made years after the murder , when the technology was available , gave nothing ) . 
  it seems the motive was jealousy : this whole family lived in a tiny village and were all lower class working in the same factory . 
  but this couple ( gr\u00e9gory 's parents ) were slightly better off : they had been able to buy two cars and a leather couch !, 
  it 's pathetic and sad . 
  - ** there 's a new weird trend in french schools : wearing socks with flip flops !, 
  ** it 's because of a [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gey47cabujk ) ... ( lots of comments i find ` patronizing ' about this on french social media . 
  it 's a crappy song okay but we have lots of those and it 's just a light-hearted fun summer one . 
  let the kids have fun , for god 's sake ! ), 
  i think that 's it ? 
  i get it now  yeah i forgot the `` n '' , obviously i was having a hard time understanding the joke since i had not noticed the missing letter . 
  well , they are mocked but it 's not that wacky : what they stand for : they advocate for the recognition that animals are sensitive beings ( already in the french law , but it 's very recent and there is still work to do to ensure this principle actually results in changes in a lot of daily-life fields ) . 
  they want to reinforce the rules regarding slaughterhouses practices ( which are awful , it 's indeniable , widespread ) , as well as the living conditions of the animals in the ( industrial mostly , of course ) farms , etc. . . they want to change the regulations regarding fishing , they want to end corrida and all the other types of `` entertainment '' that uses animals , living in bad conditions . 
  they want to end tests on animals . 
  and i guess they advocate for vegetarian/veganism diets and a better agriculture . 
  fun fact : there 's a woman called catherine deneuve who is candidating in ... rochefort !, 
  ( in case you do n't get it : an homonym of french actress catherine deneuve , most famous for her role in the young girls of rochefort . 
  this woman is from the parti animaliste . 
  i ca n't find a picture to prove it , but it 's true and quite funny ) . 
  i do n't get it ? 
  where 's the sexual innuendo ? 
  or are you just saying that you disagree with the opinion expressed ? 
  how so ? 
  as i 've said , feel free to add your own comment and contradict me . 
  once again apparently automatically removed by a bot . 
  what did i say this time ? 
  i was cautious to write `` f. ... '' , so is it `` penis '' ( i wrote `` dick '' at first then changed it , because i was worried about the bot ) ? 
  is there a slur somewhere that i do n't see ? 
  if i have to message the mods to let them know every month , it 's not worth commenting on these theads ... can we know which words trigger the bot so that we do n't use them ? 
  of course not , cause idiots will comment using them on purpose ... : / edit : aaah , thanks for approving it , 
  france : politics - ** first round of the parliamentary election today ** . 
  - the second round will be next sunday . 
  - we 're voting to choose our 577 national assembly members . 
  ( the senatorial election will be in september ) . 
  - there will be less suspense than during the uk election : ** macron 's party is heavily favoured to win an absolute majority ** (  289 seats ) . 
  [ polls and seats projections ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lections_l%c3%a9gislatives_fran%c3%a7aises_de_2017#sondages ) . 
  - we 're expecting to see many famous mps from the established parties ( les r\u00e9publicains & parti socialiste ) get crushed : some wo n't even be qualified for the second round . 
  ( my pop corn is ready , i ca n't wait ! ), 
  216 current mps are not candidating for their reelection this year ( because of a recent law forbidding multiple office-holding or simply because they know they are going to lose , bigly ) . 
  so lots of renewal is expected , probably a younger and more feminized national assembly . 
  - first results at 8pm tonight . 
  [ article in english explaining how it works ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/french-parliamentary-elections-170611042017669.html ) . 
  - ** political context since macron 's election last month : ** * [ i thought i should maybe write a paragraph to summarize the general atmosphere since the presidential election ( but it 's not easy to do briefly and objectively . 
  as i 've said before , i voted for `` far-left '' candidate m\u00e9lenchon last month - and will vote for his party again today - so interpret what i write as you want , ask other frenchies to comment on their personal views ) . 
  ] * - ** there is a `` macromania '' ** : in the media , on online forums , irl . 
  macron is praised , a lot . 
  he was just elected so , of course , he has n't had the time to do much . 
  it 's unfair to criticize him for it , agreed . 
  what he did do this last month was mostly to appear on the international stage and he managed to successfully change france 's image on the diplomatic front , agreed . 
  but that 's no reason to praise him * that * much and to refuse to hear or acknowledge the criticism . 
  cause there * are * objectively valid critics to be made : - ** there already are several important flaws about macron 's government ** : - many political affairs/scandals : the main one ( the only one that is widely talked about in the media ) concerns his `` territories cohesion '' minister , richard ferrand . 
  i wo n't even attempt to explain it cause it 's quite complex ( maybe another frenchie will try in the comments ? ), 
  there are others : his minister of the economy hired his wife as a ( very probably fake ) parliamentary asistant in the past ( similar to the fillon case and his wife penelope ) , several ministers or secretaries of state have a profile which makes them very likely to have conflicts of interests , several lrem candidates for this legislative election have been revealed to have potential judicial issues . 
  - huge red flags about macron 's governing plans and future reforms : nothing new actually , that was known during the presidential campaign but it seems neither the mainstream press nor the population find it shocking . 
  he intends to govern using orders , ie he will pass laws without a parliamentary debate . 
  the first one is massive : it 's the labout law reform this summer . 
  we had important protests last year when they passed the first one , well macron intends to pass a similar one , only more drastic . 
  70 % of people disagreed with the first , but hey ... 
  there is also a reform about counter-terrorism which basically is a kind of french patriot act that will transfer state of emergency measures into the common law ( all the exceptional measures , dangerous for civil liberties and the separation of powers , that were `` temporarily '' granted during the state of emergency - that has been renewed for years now - are going to be turned into the new normal ) . 
  and then there will be a major pension reform , which also is scary ( but it 's also super vague right now , which was n't a problem apparently during the presidential campaign , it seems journalists and electors did n't mind ... they 'll wake up in 2 years and cry ) . 
  - communication issues : macron intends to shake things up in the way he and his government handle the press . 
  some of the things he said i can only agree with ( i wo n't go into details , it 's quite minor and has to do with how he wants to communicate ) but some `` changes '' are honestly quite troubling : they are selecting the journalists covering his trips themselves , they filed a case against `` leaks '' about the contents of the labour reform ( that they intend to pass this summer without a parliamentary debate , remember ) . 
  his justice minister called the public radio to complain/pressure about their coverage of suspicions of illegal european parliamentary assistants ( same stuff as the national front case , in fact it 's the national front which outed a list of meps they say did exactly the same thing as them - be paid on european funds although they were in fact working for the party , in paris - without being prosecuted , ie double-standard ) . 
  he also tweeted to publicly support another minister who is one of the suspects ( remember : he 's our f. ... new justice minister ! ), 
  macron made a very bad '' '' `` joke '' '' '' right in front of the cameras , about boats mainly known for being used by comoran migrants . 
  his sentence was totally out of place and semantically put humans on the same level as fish . 
  several of his candidates for today 's election are homophobes but they were not asked to cancel their candidacy . 
  some of his candidates , however have been replaced because they were accused of antisemitism , although they had in fact criticized israel 's policies . 
  other news : - ** terrorist `` hammer attack '' in front of notre dame ** . 
  you probably heard about it .
