  the guy is a 40 year-old algerian journalist student who was in france legally doing a thesis . 
  his director was totally baffled ( inb4 comments : `` yeah , right , as always , wink wink '' : well , it 's truly the case here ) . 
  the prosecutor said the same thing : apparently he got radicalized alone super quickly . 
  his thesis was about the outcomes of the arab springs , specifically how journalists in maghreb countries ( such as algeria ) can help to spread democratic values by their coverage of what is happening in revolutionary movements in neighboring countries . 
  it seems that he got disillusioned with the lack of actual progress years after the initial waves of hope in north africa and felt isolated in france , with no family and very few friends . 
  it seems pathetic ( in the first sense of the term ) to me and i ca n't help but feel a bit sympathetic , especially since he did n't succceed to severely injure anyone . 
  - ** the tv host who did a homophobic '' '' `` prank '' '' '' 3 weeks ago or so got sanctioned ... for a previous '' '' `` prank '' '' '' and sexism ** . 
  they are n't allowed to run any ads for 3 weeks , which will cost the channel millions . 
  finally !, 
  ( the committee that is in charge of checking that french tv and radio outlets do n't shit on basic ethical rules has been accused of being way too lenient . 
  and it was true , they were totally useless . 
  for once they acted , strongly ) . 
  so , quick recap : 3 weeks ago i mentioned it , he created a fake profile on a gay dating forum and had people call him up , not knowing their calls were being broadcasted live . 
  he made fun of them , etc. 
  but that 's not what he has been sanctioned for , this will probably come later ( the committee is always super late to review things and when they feel something warrants a sanction they report it to an actual judge , which takes ages ) . 
  soooo , what has he been sanctioned for ? 
  * if i understood correctly * it was for another very creepy '' '' `` prank '' '' '' : he told a colleague he had just accidentally killed someone and asked said colleague to take the blame for him , all fimed with `` hidden cameras '' . 
  ( yeah crazy . 
  so ... everyone is kinda pretending to believe that the colleague did n't know all this was fake , of course he knew . 
  but they showed a scene in which someone was asked to take the blame for a murder and did n't learn all this was fake until the day after , when he was shown crying , being totally traumatized by it . 
  they all act , it 's creepy as hell , but many young people watch this show and believe it , many adults as well actually . ), 
  and there was another scene during which a female colleague was blindfolded and the host put her hand on his crotch `` as usual , hahaha '' ( one of the main female co-hosts revealed that during her job interview , he put his penis on her shoulder ... she says it 's similar to a performance artist ... as i 've said last time , all his co-hosts are forced to humiate themselves during his daily show , but it 's hard to pity them because they all agree to act and play this `` game '' ) . 
  * [ sorry for the , once again , super long and probably especially confusing post , but the basics are in bold  time for me to go to the polling station !, 
   i could have written a long one again , but it would have echoed my post from last week so i do n't think it 's that interesting for foreigners . 
  the week ends on a positive note with prizes for many european artists , which is a nice change . 
  other than that , i think it was a pretty uneventful week in france . 
  - congrats sweden for the palme d'or in cannes !, 
  it was quite a surprise since rumors seemed to be very favorable for french film `` 120 battements par minute '' , which * only * got the grand prize . 
  oh well , nevermind : both films look good , plus we also got a prize for a first film ( `` jeune femme '' ) . 
  congrats to the uk for lynne ramsay ( scenario plus male performance for joaquim phoenix ) . 
  congrats greece ( yorgos lanthimos won the prize for best scenario as well ) . 
  congrats germany ( female performance prize awarded to diane kruger ) . 
  congrats russia ( jury prize ) , congrats usa ( sofia coppola ( got the prize for directing ) , congrats australia ( nicole kidman got a special prize for the 70th anniversary of the festival ) and congrats china ( best short film ) . 
  france : politics - ** we have a new government ** . 
  - [ edouard philippe ] ( http://www.closermag.fr/var/closermag/storage/images/article/edouard-philippe-cambriole-ses-donnees-personnelles-derobees-720798/5680654-1-fre-fr/edouard-philippe-cambriole-ses-donnees-personnelles-derobees.jpg ) was named prime minister . 
  he 's right-wing , he supported alain jupp\u00e9 during their primary ( aka the more respectable part of the les r\u00e9publicains party ) . 
  he 's not very famous nationally , he 's the mayor of le havre and he seems to have done a good job there ( like alain jupp\u00e9 in bordeaux ) . 
  - the government is composed of 18 ministers and 4 secretaries of state . 
  half are men , half are women . 
  some are politicians ( from the left , the center and the right ) while others come from the `` civil society '' . 
  - bruno le maire is minister of the economy : he 's right-wing . 
  gerald darmanin , also right-wing ( sarkozyst ) is in charge of the budget . 
  jean-yves le drian is in charge of foreign ( & european ) affairs : he 's a socialist ( he was hollande 's defense minister ) . 
  i wo n't list all the rest but another important one is the minister of education : it 's the director of a business school who already worked at this minister under sarkozy ( when they basically destroyed everything ) . 
  - the most interesting pick is nicolas hulot for the environment . 
  he 's very famous and popular because he used to be the presenter of a tv show about nature and the environment , before founding a foundation and becoming an activist . 
  he played an important role in the ratifying of the cop21 in 2015 ( acting as a kind of diplomat in this matter , trying to convince heads of state ) . 
  he advised several french presidents but always refused their offers to become their minister of the environment . 
  so the question is : will he be able to do what he wants or will the ( right-wing ) pm and other ministers in charge of the economy prevent him from achieving his goals ? 
  will he quit before the end of his mandate ? 
  - ** the campaign for the parliamentary elections ( june 11th & 18th ) has begun ** . 
  - macron 's party ( named `` la r\u00e9publique en marche '' , after his movement `` en marche '' ) is in a very favorable postition right now . 
  the same ca n't be said for the other parties : the socialist party is still in disarray , after the terrible score of their candidate during the presidential election . 
  lots of divisions , they are simply inaudible ... 
  the republican party is doing a bit better but struggling with the same kinds of internal divisions ( between those who say `` we have to work with macron '' and those who say `` we are different , let 's not lose our identity and our principles '' , roughly ) . 
  the national front is also in bad shape at the moment after marine le pen 's defeat and the end of her campaign which disappointed lots of electors . 
  there are divisions , but honestly i ca n't predict whether it will result in a schism or whether they 'll manage to overcome this difficult period . 
  ( historically they do poorly during parliamentary elections anyway ) . 
  `` far left '' party `` la france insoumise '' seems to be in bad shape as well . 
  they are portrayed very negatively in the media and in social media ( for being too aggressive and too negative about macron ) . 
  but i ca n't really tell how it will impact electors . 
  - these parliamentary elections will in any case bring something positive : renewal . 
  many old mps have decided not to candidate for their reelection ( either because of a recent law about multiple office-holding , or because they realise they will lose ... ) which means we have lots of new candidates this year . 
  we 'll likely end up with a national assembly composed of younger members , with more women too . 
  but it makes the national outcome of all these local elections difficult to predict ( parliamentary elections are always more difficult to analyze than the presidential , plus this year we witnessed a radical change with the collapse of our old traditional parties . 
  but , still , if you look at each local political offer where old & famous mps are fighting to stay in place , while younger new faces are benefiting from positive press , it 's very hard to guess what will happen . 
  the campaign between the two rounds will probably be very interesting ) . 
  so the question , obviously , is : will macron end up with a parliamentary majority , will he have to form a coalition ( with either the les r\u00e9publicains or with the socialists ) ? 
  ( or , but much more unlikely , will he face a cohabitation and in that case have to work with a totally new government ? ), 
  like all previous french presidents , she was the first foreign head of state he visited . 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------- other news - ** the 70th cannes film festival started ** . 
  it ends next sunday . 
  - ** there was a controversy about a tv host who did a homophobic ` prank ' ** . 
  cyril hanouna is the host of a stupid but popular daily tv show . 
  he already generated many controversies in the past months , because of sexist or homophobic ` jokes ' in particular . 
  this time he created a fake profile on an online dating forum and gay men called his show ( not knowing their calls were being broadacsted live on tv - the day after international day against homophobia , transphobia and biphobia ... ) . 
  he made fun of them , pretending to be a stereotypical gay man , before hunging up on them , etc. 
  lots of people complained about it to the committee supposedly in charge of supervising the ethics of french tv and radio channels , but they probably wo n't do anything , once again . 
  this guy is worth millions ( he signed a gigantic contract for the next 4 or 5 years ) and is watched by millions of people . 
  his show is a weird watch : he 's like a guru with something like 20 guests who come and go , alternating each day ( 8 to 10 co-hosts around him each evening ) . 
  supposedly they comment on `` the media '' : they light-heartedly review other tv shows and make jokes , all good fun . 
  in fact the host humiliates them , or rather forces them to humiliate themselves . 
  they all have a precise designated `` role '' to play and he makes them talk about their personal lives . 
  it 's kinda hard to explain but there are lots ` redneck ' '' '' `` jokes '' '' '' , often sexist and very often homophobic . 
  they have smiles on their faces , they make jokes , they mess with each other ... in fact there 's an underlying violence all throughout ( i do n't know how to call it , `` late stage entertainment '' maybe ) . 
  many people have voiced their concerns on the impact it has in school playgrounds particularly , because their behaviour encourages bullying : it 's kind of a 101 lesson actually , every evening at dinner time . 
  one of the main guests is gay ( and he 's basically there to play `` the gay '' ) . 
  i think the chief editor is a lesbian . 
  so that 's the excuse : `` look , we are n't homophobes , mathieu laughs too !, 
  we are n't sexist , enora makes sexist jokes too ! '' ... 
  he sold his `` concept '' to several countries , i think mainly in north africa but maybe some of you have had the '' '' `` chance '' '' '' to see this great tv show adapted in your country . 
  sorry if that 's the case . 
  thanks . 
  several media outlets have been banned from the national front gathering tonight ( they were refused accreditation ) . 
  * lib\u00e9ration * decided to boycott the event , others may follow soon . 
  this is coming after an editorial signed by many journalists this week ( that i forgot to mention ) precisely against these methods . 
  on top of investigative online newspaper * mediapart * and infotainment daily tv show * quotidien * which have been banned by the nf for years , * charlie hebdo * , * politico * , * rue89 * , ( french ) * buzzfeed * , * les jours * , * streetpress * , * le bondy blog * as well as a foreign journalist for * the atlantic * and 2 for la * rai 3 * have been banned . 
  the national front says the place they rented is too small . 
  but it seems they selected the journalists they disliked the less . 
  can you explain why renzi was elected with such a wide support after losing the referendum ?
