  it 's the same thing this time : sarkozy claims this new `` les r\u00e9publicains '' party is gon na reconciale all the tendencies inside his previous party ( ump ) , but they also invite people from the center to join them . 
  ( it does n't seem likely to really happen though : i do n't think the center would benefit from an alliance with the right , so this new party is probably going to remain exactly the same as the one before , no new members from the center . 
  this idea of `` republic ( an ) '' is supposed to embody all the important values of french politics - liberty , equality , fraternity . 
  all politicians ( well especially those from the two main parties , on the right and on the left ) use the word a lot during their speeches . 
  it 's a bit void imo but it 's a motto that is supposed to appeal to all electors . 
  this choice of name has been criticized , because obvioulsy calling themselves `` the republicans '' is like kidnapping a common good that 's supposed to belong to everyone in the country . 
  ( you can be republican without supporting the ideas of the right ) ( you can also support the values we attach to the republic without necessarily wanting this system of government ) . 
  but a court ruled in favour of this choice : they were allowed to change their name . 
  - final thoughts ( if you 're still reading ) : as i said , this facade of unity is not really fooling anyone : during their first congress sarkozy 's main rival for the 2017 presidential election , alain jupp\u00e9 , was booed by many of sarkozy 's fans in the audience . 
  not really good for their image . 
  it 's sarkozy 's fault : he openly exposes his hate for him instead of playing fair-play , encouraging his supporters to display feelings of animosity in the open . 
  ( the primaries , to decide who will be the candidate for the `` les republicains '' party in 2017 , will take place in november 2016 . 
  sarkozy will be opposed to alain jupp\u00e9 . 
  and others will run too . 
  alain jupp\u00e9 is preferred by the majority of french electors , but amongst the right-wing militants ( the only ones who will actually vote ) it 's sarkozy who still has more fans ) . 
  this respectable image they are trying to build , based on the beautiful republican values , is also completely tarnished by sarkozy 's way of criticizing the government , using a very diresrectful tone each time he trashes hollande and all his ministers . 
  in france rebranding a party is quite frequent . 
  especially on the right . 
  the ump was called `` rpr '' not too long ago ; they had to change the name because of affairs ( * ) . 
  sarkozy is the president of the party . 
  after his defeat against hollande in may 2012 he said he would stop politics . 
  nobody believed him . 
  we were right . 
  he made his political come back last summer when he announced he would be running for president of the ump . 
  he won , that was last november . 
  many people , including some of his best allies , think that taking this place was a mistake . 
  that he should have kept his image of ex-president , rather than `` lowering '' himself to this less prestigious post of party leader . 
  running a party , especially today 's ump ( well `` les r\u00e9publicains '' now ) puts people in a vulnerable position ; it 's easier to stay above that and avoid all the petty arguments . 
  and of course , since sarkozy has a bunch of affairs that may end up in court in the short term , it 's maybe not the best strategy . 
  maybe they 'll need to re-brand the party again very soon  but sarkozy still has a lot of supporters . 
  most french people would prefer having alain jupp\u00e9 ( * ) as the future candidate for the right in 2017 . 
  but the militants who are gon na vote during the primary elections do n't reflect that : it seems that this portion of the french electors are still in love with sarkozy . 
  these primary elections are supposed to take place at the end of 2016 , at least that 's what sarkozy wants . 
  ( alain jupp\u00e9 and other party members who want to run against sarkozy would probably prefer spring 2016 ) . 
  ( * ) alain jupp\u00e9 was at the center of the affairs that led to the rebranding of the rpr -  ump ...  people have already forgotten . 
  and/or they have n't but what he did ( `` minor '' corruption ) was nothing compared to sarkozy ( i should really state here that no , sarkozy has n't been convicted of anything ... yet . 
  i know i sound very against him , but it 's true that no court case ended up with a conviction for now ) . 
  there have been mild criticism from within the party yesterday . 
  criticism about the way sarkozy strongly attacked the government . 
  they are all putting on a show , repeating `` we are united '' , but sarkozy keeps gesticulating and making angry speeches that fill the excitement of a portion of his militants , which is not very good for their image . 
  regarding the tax story : do you mean amazon ? 
  i just heard on the news that amazon finally agreed to pay taxes in several european countries . 
  i believe they already started in the uk actually , and in other countries , and announced they would do the same in france too this week . 
  i mean of course we think about the us . 
  sarkozy and a lot of his colleagues on the right probably think the comparison with the us boosts their image and is an advantage . 
  but the choice of this word in france is more due to the fact that politicians have been using this word to refer to all the values ( presumably ? ), 
  attached to it - liberty , equality , fraternity ( well in their case it 's mostly liberty , sarkozy is n't a big fan of the 2 others ... ) in recent years ( and particularly when talking about terrorism since isis emerged ) many politicians , on the right but also on the left , have been using the terms `` republic '' and `` republican '' as a real motto . 
  it 's practical for them but really what ideas are behind it ? 
  they simply repeat the word and that 's pretty much it . 
  the republic is just a system of government after all , they are oversimplifying things . 
  there are states that are `` republics '' and do not share humanist values . 
  there are states that have a different form of government and share the same democratic principles as france . 
  it 's just a portemanteau-word that they like to use because it 's quicker than saying long sentences about democracy , liberty , equality and fraternity ... especially when at the same time they demonstrate that maybe they are n't that irreproachable in this regard . 
  forgot two things : - ** french red cross faces a huuuuge fine for overworked staff ** , an investigation revealed today . 
  we 're talking major violations of working hours regulation . 
  ( relevant : a deputee proposed an amendment to recognize `` burn-out '' as an occupational disease , a few days ago . ), 
  - ** a student received seven death threats since january , when he published a school newspaper in hommage to charlie hebdo . 
  ** he 's the chief editor of the newspaper in this high school and the week following the attacks he published a special issue about ch . 
  he has received letters sent with bullets and swastikas , some sent to his home , others left in his school locker . 
  the police investigated but parents and teachers say they are not taking the case seriously enough . 
  ** france ** : - on wednesday , ** president fran\u00e7ois hollande held a ceremony in honour of 4 wwii resistance figures , two men and two women , who entered the pantheon ** ( the resting place for french heroes ) . 
  genevi\u00e8ve de gaulle-anthonioz , charles de gaulle 's niece , joined a resistance movement based around academics at paris 's anthropology museum , the mus\u00e9e de l\u2019homme . 
  in 1943 , she was captured in a paris book shop and deported to the ravensbruck where she spent part of her time in isolation after heinrich himmler , aware of her name , decided to keep her alive as a possible exchange prisoner . 
  she was finally released in april 1945 . 
  after the war she dedicated her life to fighting poverty and campaigning for homeless people , shocked by shanty towns outside paris . 
  she died in 2002 , aged 81 . 
  germaine tillion , an ethnologist , met de gaulle-anthonioz in the same resistance movement at the paris museum , and both worked to counter nazi propaganda . 
  she was denounced and arrested at paris 's gare de lyon and also sent to ravensbruck . 
  there she found her mother , who had also joined the resistance , and who would die in the gas chambers in 1945 . 
  after the war she studied and wrote about ravensbruck , as well as working in algeria , saying her work as an ethnologist had saved her . 
  she died in 2008 aged 100 . 
  pierre brossolette , similarly based at the paris anthropology museum , led several missions as an intelligence agent for de gaulle 's free france , and became a resistance spokesman on the bbc . 
  arrested and tortured in 1944 , he jumped to his death from a top-floor window to avoid disclosing information , shouting that he would never give up and would die free . 
  jean zay was france 's education minister before the war . 
  he went to morocco in 1940 , intending to form a resistance government in north africa . 
  he was arrested but continued his efforts from prison . 
  he was killed by the french militia , a paramilitary force of the collaborationist vichy regime , in 1944 . 
  ( until then , marie curie was the only woman to be `` pantheonised '' . 
  vs over 70 men ) . 
  - the ** `` ump '' party becomes `` the republicans '' ** . 
  nicolas sarkozy held a political yesterday , to launch his `` new '' party : the republicans , after judges decided that they could use this name . 
  the choice of name had sparked furious criticism , with many people regarding it as a `` semantic hold-up '' : judging it is n't fair for the right to take the monopoly of the term , since french people of all political persuasions call themselves republicans and support the values of liberty and freedom of the french republic . 
  ( several leftwing associations , as well 140 individuals -- including a family who have the surname r\u00e9publicain - brought a court challenge , which was rebuted by the judges on friday ) . 
  this rebranding of the ump is of course a way for sarkozy and his friends to distance themselves from the dozen of affairs that are tarnishing their image . 
  ( will it work ? ), 
  sarkozy attacked the government ( as usual ) during his speech yesterday . 
  ( to which prime minister manuel valls replied that `` we need to have a debate between republicans without insulting each other '' . 
  he used the term `` republicans '' on purpose , to show that the right is n't gon na be able to `` kidnap '' the word . ), 
  alain jupp\u00e9 , fellow party member and his principal rival for the upcoming primary election ( before the 2017 presidentials ) has ( once again ) been booed by many militants in the audience . 
  so much for the displayed unity they are pretending to have . 
  ( by the way sarkozy did not attend the pantheon ceremony in honour of 4 heroes of the republic , although he was invited , of course . 
  i do n't personally know what better thing he had to do ; do other frenchies know ? ), 
  - ** 8 people were declared guilty of exploiting 92-year-old l'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt , 12th richest person in the world . 
  eric woerth , campaign treasurer during nicolas sarkozy 's successful bid for the presidency in 2007 , was acquitted . 
  ** - ** amazon is gon na pay its taxes in france ** , and in other european countries . 
  well i guess we 're supposed to say thank you ? 
  assholes . 
  ( also in the news : - the ** fifa scandal ** of course ( platini is angry . 
  no\u00ebl le gra\u00ebt , ** president of the french federation , voted for blatter ** : `` if blatter had [ done anything wrong ] , he would already be in jail . '' ... 
  how i would like to throw a pie in his face ... ) - ** bernard henry levy , self-proclaimed `` philosopher '' and `` political activist '' received a ( nother ) pie in his face yesterday .
