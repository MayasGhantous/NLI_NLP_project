  like , what are people thinking about him and the party ? 
  everyone is pretty much on the same page , no internal divisions ? 
  or maybe he 's the only one who stands out ? 
  france : politics - ** second and final round of the french presidential election today ** . 
  - ** results will be known at 8pm ** ( french time , utc +01 ) . 
  - ** recent polls had macron at 63 % - marine le pen at 37 % ** . 
  - turnout rate at noon was 28,23 % ( almost the same as two weeks ago for the first round , only slightly lower ) . 
  - ** marine le pen 's campaign was quite bad this week ** . 
  last week i commented to say that macron 's campaign had been rather bad ( you may have seen articles decribing how he was not really convincing for a lot of people ) . 
  well le pen 's last days were worse : - she changed her mind on the euro and it 's very blurry now . 
  this was last week but i forgot to mention it . 
  she was interviewed several times this week but never cleared things up . 
  - she plagiarized a fillon speech from 2 weeks before . 
  i assume you heard about it , it seemed to have made the news internatinally . 
  - ** she clearly lost the last debate on wednesday ** . 
  the vast majority of french people thought this debate was awful , the worst we 've seen . 
  most of the responsability does probably fall on le pen 's shoulders . 
  she was super aggressive throughout the whole thing . 
  but macron could have done better imo , even if it 's not easy against someone who behaves that way . 
  ( the 2 journalists also did a poor job at moderating it all ) . 
  - ** the end of the week was full of `` fake news '' from her and other top nf party leaders ** . 
  during the debate , at the end , she suggested it would be bad for him if news about an offshore account in the bahamas surfaced in the near future . 
  ( during the next two days , a hoax about a macron account in the cayman islands was shared on social media . 
  apparently originating from 4chan ) ... on friday , gilbert collard ( one the top members of the national front party ) tweeted a close-up picture of macron 's ear during the debate , supposedly showing that the candidate had been wearing an earpiece : the picture showed nothing even remotely weird ! ... 
  florian philippot ( her main advisor and spokesperson ) tweeted a screenshot of a fake text message supposedly proving that en marche ( macron 's party ) was responsible for organizing a protest in front of the cathedral marine le pen visited that day ... [ all this may not matter to her electorate . 
  there are people saying they do n't even believe in her programme and did n't like her performance during the debate but they 'll vote for her regardless , cause they 're angry and do n't trust politicians anymore . 
  but i think it 's possible that this week , in particular , will have a lasting effect on the national front . 
  they had managed to build a quite respectable image for themselves in the last decade and i feel like this has been shattered for some % of the french population . 
  the next months will be interesting . ], 
  there was also another thing that trended on social media on thursday or friday : `` bayrougate '' . 
  fran\u00e7ois bayrou is an important french centrist who backed macron during the campaign and is now one of his closest allies . 
  in april , a man posted an article on a blog in which he revealed he had worked as a fake parliamentary assistant for bayrou 's party 20 years ago ( similar to the marine le pen vs eu parliament case ) . 
  at the time in april , it did n't make much noise . 
  the guy did an ama on r/france but it failed to reach social media : it was just mentioned in a few tweets . 
  well , suddenly ( ... ) this week it made it to the n \u00b0 1 trending topics on french twitter and lots of people commented on it , expressing anger towards journalists who had been censoring this guy 's revelations . 
  except several journalists reacted , to say that the guy was probably delusional ( he wrote some tweets about his flat being searched , his laptop being hacked ) and he had refused to answer their questions when they emailed him or he emailed them last month . 
  ( i hope that 's not too confusing , i do n't want to be too long . 
  i 'm not sure how much impact this thing had , it did n't last that long on twitter , but quite a lot of people seemed to have read this guy 's blog post . 
  maybe it was even more successful than the macronleaks , idk . 
  anyway it does not * directly * affect macron ) . 
  - ** macronleaks were published one or two hours before the end of the official campaign ** . 
  ... you 've all read about that so i wo n't go into much details . 
  i 'll just say that it 's a fail , not a lot of people cared . 
  it trended on twitter late on friday night ( and a little bit yesterday maybe . 
  it was the n \u00b0 3 or 4 tt this morning , not anymore ) but quite quickly people realized nothing juicy came out of it . 
  most middle aged and old people probably did n't even hear about it . 
  ( you probably heard about the `` media blackout '' law we have in france for every election , starting at midnight on friday before an election so that no new element or poll can influence voters ) . 
  - ** nicolas dupont-aignan 's voters are not happy about his decision to form an alliance with le pen ** . 
  last week he announced he would be le pen 's prime minister if she wins tonight . 
  he got 4,7 % of the votes two weeks ago . 
  there were protests in the town where he 's the mayor . 
  difficult to say what impact his decision will have tonight and in the future for him , only a few polls surveyed them . 
  but it seems like most of his supporters did n't like this move . 
  - ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon 's supporters were surveyed on their choices for this second round and about 1/3 favoured voting macron , 1/3 voting blank , 1/3 abstaining ** . 
  - the media kept criticizing m\u00e9lenchon and his supporters ( like they did last week ) for supposedly not fighting le pen enough , or clearly enough . 
  although about 15 % of the people who voted for m\u00e9lenchon in the first round will vote for le pen today ( according to the polls ) which is far less than fillon 's supporters . 
  and of course m\u00e9lenchon and all left-wing politicians always stressed how important it is to fight the far right . 
  - so , like the party had said it would , a `` consultation '' opened to the 450 000 people who clicked online to support m\u00e9lenchon 's candidacy was organized after the first round . 
  the results were made public on tuesday . 
  about half of his most fervent supporters participated and it 's pretty even between those who said they would vote macron , those who said they would prefer voting blank and those who said they would abstain . 
  ( the polls are different : about 50 % / 52 % of his elctorate say they 'll vote macron . 
  obviously not everyone who voted for him 2 weeks ago had clicked on the party 's website to register as more active supporters ) . 
  other news : - ** a radicalized ex-soldier was arrested near a military base and he confessed to having intended to commit a terrorist attack ** . 
  there 's a thread about it on the front page . 
  france : politics : - ** emmanuel macron & marine le pen won the first round of the presidential election ** . 
  they 'll compete in the second round next sunday . 
  i guess i 'm not teaching you anything new  - but let 's put the final results again : ( abstention : 22,23 % of registered voters - 10\u00a0577\u00a0572 people ) emmanuel macron - en marche - center : 24,01 % - 8 657 326 votes marine le pen - front national - far right : 21,30 % - 7 679 493 fran\u00e7ois fillon - les r\u00e9publicains - right : 20,01 % - 7 213 797 jl m\u00e9lenchon - france insoumise - far left : 19,58 % - 7 060 885 benoit hamon - parti socialiste - left : 6,36 % - 2 291 565 nicolas dupont-aignan - debout la france : 4,70 % - 1 695 186 5 other `` small '' candidates : between 1,21 % and 0,18 % . 
  interesting stat : about half of the people who voted for macron said they voted for him by default ... ( 84 % of m\u00e9lenchon 's electorate voted by conviction , 81 % for le pen , 79 % for fillon , 78 % for hamon ) . 
  - for the second round , 1 poll says ( i could n't be bothered to look for a summary of all the polls conducted this week . 
  figures vary but that 's roughly how it goes ) : fillon 's voters will : 45 % macron - 31 % abstain - 24 % le pen m\u00e9lenchon 's : 45 % macron - 39 % abstain - 16 % le pen hamon : 81 % macron - 17 % abstain - 2 % le pen overrall it 's still around 60 % for macron - 40 % for le pen . 
  - ** nicolas dupont-aignan backed marine le pen , will be her prime minister if she wins ** . 
  nicolas dupont-aignan left the ump party ( now lr `` les r\u00e9publicains '' ) in 2007 over disagreements with sarkozy , mainly over the eu question ( the 2005 referendum about the eu treaty , which divided france : a majority voted `` no '' ... their votes were ignored ) . 
  he then founded his own party and was already a candidate in the 2012 presidential election . 
  this year he got 4,70 % of the votes . 
  he always said he was filling a void , between the right-wing party ( liberal economically ) and the far-right party ( xenophobic ) . 
  well , after always swearing he would never form an alliance with the national front , he finally did . 
  it 's not that much of a surprise , but still , it 's unclear how his supporters will react . 
  it 's also unclear how national front supporters ( and top members ) will react , since the party already has to work with different political lines and electorates . 
  also : nicolas dupont-aignan is quite `` goofy '' ( i do n't know what word to use , but his image is n't that good , i do n't see him fit very well inside the national front headquarters ) . 
  according to recent polls conducted before this news ( he announced it yesterday ) , about 30 % / 40 % of his electorate was planning on voting for le pen next sunday . 
  it will be interesting to see how this evolves , if it does change things one way or another . 
  - ** marine le pen stepped down as president of her party , they nominated a holocaust revisionist to replace her , then switched to a more respectable figure ** . 
  she chose to step down so as to further de-demonize her image 12 days before the second round ( but it fooled no one ) . 
  the guy they picked to replace her , jean-fran\u00e7ois jalkh , is not very famous but he made the news very quickly : in 2000 , he had denied the fact that zyklon b was used to conduct mass extermination and in 2000 he praised the works of famous revisionist robert faurisson ... 
  they replaced him ( with steeve briois , who is under investigation in two cases for hateful stuff he posted on social media ) . 
  - ** intense criticism towards jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon for not endorsing macron , as his electorate is divided between voting macron/blank/abstaining ** . 
  jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon ( `` far-left '' , who came 4rth ) did n't immediately call for people to vote for macron . 
  ( unlike the top members of all the main political parties ) . 
  he says that , of course , voting for le pen is out of the question , but people should be able to decide by themselves whether they want to vote for macron/against le pen in order to be sure that she does n't get elected or if they ca n't bring themselves to do that and prefer to abstain this time or vote blank to show their disapproval of macron 's program . 
  he says that his own personal ballot will not matter to people , who are old enough to decide for themselves . 
  as he had said long before the first round , the movement organized a `` consulation '' of the 450 000 people who backed his candidacy online . 
  ( it 's a kind of poll , they say whether they 'll vote macron/blank/abstain and the results will be communicated on tuesday , not as a `` this is what the majority decided , all m\u00e9lenchon voters should follow this line '' but rather `` here 's what our movement thinks , there are different views '' ) . 
  he also released a new youtube video , in which he reacts to the intense media backlash that ensued and reiterates his reasoning . 
  he clearly suggests he 'll vote macron , but stresses that people should be free to decide by themselves , while also repeatedly saying that of course voting le pen is n't even an option for far-left voters . 
  - ** hollande said macron is n't doing enough to appeal to voters ** . 
  president fran\u00e7ois hollande ( who backed macron before the first round ) of course backed macron again . 
  but he also publicly warned him , saying `` you have to deserve people 's votes '' . 
  - ** macron 's campaigning has n't been very good this week ** . 
  if i try to write about this , i 'm gon na be way too long , again . 
  and it 's difficult to stay as neutral as possible with this .
