  i 'll let other frenchies comment or maybe i 'll come back later . 
  - ** there will be a debate on wednesday , 9pm , on tf1 & france 2 ** . 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- other news : - ** ceremony for the police officer shot dead last thursday on the champs elys\u00e9e ** . 
  his partner ( the policeman was gay ) gave a beautiful speech . 
  he echoed the message of a man who lost his wife ( and mother of their months old baby ) in the paris attacks : `` you will not have my hatred '' . 
  and jean-marie le pen was not sorry for this man , as he 's a homophobe . 
  ( too lazy to look for the elegant quote ) . 
  - ** the lafarge company is in trouble for having paid isis to keep working in syria ** . 
  it 's something that was brought up several times by m\u00e9lenchon during the campaign ( `` they were complicit , they too should be prosecuted , not ` just ' the terrorists ) . 
  i feel like i forgot at least one important point , but that was a heavy week . 
  argh !, 
   he has good punchlines , yes , i chose short ones that were quick to translate . 
  `` poutou '' means `` little kiss ''  you say it to kids . 
  there 's another member of his party who has a cute surname too , i ca n't remember what it is ( maybe `` mignon '' = literally `` cute '' ) . 
  maybe they will say that / r/wholesomememes is more suited ? 
  i do n't know , my title is about `` memes '' cause that was easy to understand , but the post is more about how the french internet in general reacted to the campaign . 
  well i never visited this sub . 
  so be my guest , x-post it if you want ... 
  i ca n't think of a clever title , i 'm exhausted right now , i ca n't even type anymore , 
  ah thank you . 
  it was a fun post to make but by the end i was exhausted . 
  glad you like it . 
  i hope foreigners wo n't find it too hard to relate to . 
  haha . 
  no , cause m\u00e9lenchon would be the clear winner . 
  his memes are massively positive , unlike those of his opponents . 
  poutou would be 2nd , 
  on paper yes , but honestly i do n't think his views matter anymore . 
  i 'd say most people heard about it , were n't surprised at all , shrugged their shoulders and it did not impact their choice . 
  france : politics : - ** one week away from the first round of the presidential election : 4 candidates are leading ** . 
  the turnout rate is still predicted to be low . 
  the number of indecisive voters is still important but finally declining . 
  - in 7 days , we will finally know who the 2 candidates qualified for the second round are . 
  ( and this second round is in 3 weeks : the name of the next french president will be known on the 7th of may ) . 
  - recent polls predict a close race between ** emmanuel macron ( center ) , marine le pen ( far-right ) , jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon ( `` far-left '' ) and fran\u00e7ois fillon ( right ) : they are all between 23 % and 20 % ** . 
  le pen and macron have been leading in the polls since the beginning of the campaign and they are still ahead of the other two , but their margins are dropping a little bit while m\u00e9lenchon 's surge is continuing and fillon is seeing a surge as well . 
  so , how reliable are these polls ? 
  everything seems to be possible at this stage . 
  - the turnout rate is difficult to predict but it will likely be low ( by french standards ) . 
  ** polls predict an abstention rate ranging between 26 % and 35 % ** : that 's quite a wide margin !, 
  ( historically , the ` infamous ' presidential election of 2002 is still present in everyone 's memory : 28,4 % of french electors did not vote in the first round , which helped jean-marie le pen to reach the second round - against jacques chirac , who won by 80 % . 
  in 2007 , 16 % abstained , and in 2012 they were 20 % ) . 
  - ** this election is also marked by the fact that many voters have remained undecisive for longer than usual ** . 
  about two weeks before the election , they usually say they are set on their votes but this time it 's different : many french voters seem to have trouble making a decision and sticking to it with certainty . 
  these figures are finally evolving , but wide discrepancies remain : marine le pen 's voters were always the most decided ones : approximately 80 % of them were sure to vote for her weeks ago and they are about 90 % now according to some polls . 
  similar thing for fillon recently . 
  m\u00e9lenchon 's electorate is more undecided : about 60 % of his supporters are saying their choice is definitive . 
  macron is the candidate whose electorate has been characterized by its undecisiveness but polls are saying he 's at about the same % as m\u00e9lenchon now , ie around 60 % . 
  ( so , in short : marine le pen and emmanuel macron have always been predicted to gather a lot of votes but her electors are sure about their vote while his are undecisive ; fillon has had a rough campaign but his base is solidifying ; m\u00e9lenchon 's electorate is quite undecisive still , but since he 's seen a surge in the last month ( unlike macron ) , the results seem quite unpredictable ) . 
  [ le monde article with recent graphs , in french ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2017/04/13/comment-l-incertitude-des-electeurs-pesera-sur-le-premier-tour-de-l-election-presidentielle-2017_5110892_4355770.html ) . 
  - ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon has been the target of many attacks ** . 
  - the candidate who has experienced a seemingly constant surge in polls for the past month is at the center of the attacks , from the other candidates and also from the media . 
  they are caricaturing him as a communist ( he 's not , even if he is backed by the communists ) , with a dangerous stance on foreign affairs : allegedly pro-poutine and pro-assad ( he 's not , he keeps stressing he wants france to renew with a more independent stance on international matters so as to avoid wars ) . 
  - the main line of attack has been centered around the fact that his programme states that he wants france to become a member of the alba alliance : an intergovernmental organization intended to encourage cooperation between latin american and caribbean countries . 
  so of course , since it was created by cuba and venezuela , the ` dangerous red socialist ' argument is easy . 
  but m\u00e9lenchon answered back , explaining the overseas territories of french guiana , guadeloupe and martinique would benefit from integrating this alliance and citing the numerous alliances france is part of , many of which include undemocratic counties . 
  [ i ca n't make it much shorter . 
  as i stated before , i 'm a m\u00e9lenchon voter , so judge for yourselves , ask for more details if you want me to expand on this ] . 
  - ** fran\u00e7ois hollande criticized m\u00e9lenchon and ( quite directly ) backed macron ** . 
  until now the president had remained neutral/silent and said he would wait for the second round before backing a candidate . 
  ( but it was rumored that he was still in contact with macron whom he probably preferred ) . 
  well this week he gave three interviews ( i think ? ), 
  and , on top of - not directly but quite clearly - suggesting people should choose macron ... he attacked ~ ~ marine le pen ~ ~ jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon !, 
  ( yes , he 's also said marine le pen is dangerous and she ought to be fought , but he chose to be more audibly aggressive towards a left-wing candidate ... what an asshole ) . 
  he says m\u00e9lenchon does not represent a left which is capable of governing and that his views are simplistic etc. . . - apart from that , all candidates are , of course , campaigning hard : ( m\u00e9lenchon is the one whose rallies attract the most people . 
  does n't mean he 'll win obviously , but his campaign is objectively the most successful ) . 
  - ** a judge asked for marine le pen 's immunity to be lifted ** . 
  over the allegations of a misuse of money in the european parliament to fund fake jobs . 
  ( as usual , this does n't impact her at all ) . 
  - ** fran\u00e7ois fillon 's wife was hired much earlier than oringinally thought ** . 
  - `` penelope gate '' scandal ( alledged fake jobs of fillon 's family members , i wo n't explain it all again ) : the journalists who revealed the story thought penelope fillon had been hired as an assistant since 1989 if i recall correctly . 
  well this week we learnt it started even earlier ( was it fake from the beginning or not ? 
  we do n't know . 
  but he lied once again , because he had already been proven wrong when he initially gave a date , and so it 's even more false now ) . 
  - his `` fran\u00e7afrique '' rich friend who bought him expensive suits revealed this week that the fillon campaign asked him to deny the allegations . 
  ( same as for le pen : these 2 new episodes wo n't change things ) . 
  - also , `` sens commun '' which is kinda the french `` tea party '' ( founded during the parliamentary debates about gay marriage ) and has been a driving force in fillon 's campaign will probably be part of his government if he 's elected ... this made the news but i do n't really understand why , it 's not a surprise . 
  these people are led by die-hard catholics , they are homophobic and obsessed about gender ( they believe there 's a conspiracy to teach homosexuality to little boys and erase gender differences ) , they also want to fight the right to abortion . 
  - ** nothing much concerning macron ** ? 
  well , there 's one controversy : the `` fachosphere '' ( = far-right people but also far-right people pretending to be right-wing ; ie le pen and fillon supporters ) attacked macron on the fact that one of his militants is an islamist and macron fired him . 
  ( = they took screenshots of some of his tweets and portrayed him as a dangerous political muslim who 's not `` charlie '' . 
  there was absolutely nothing wrong with any of these tweets - you may disagree with his opinions , but there was nothing `` radical '' or dangerous about them at all . 
  macron nevertheless immediadetely yield to their attempts at creating a controversy by asking for the man 's resignation ... what happened ? 
  well , of course it only fueled the controversy and it became bigger . 
  well played emmanuel ! ), 
  [ so this candidate who was pretending to be more inclusive than manuel valls - and his islamophobic rhetoric - is totally not clear about what he stands for in regards to `` national identity '' and `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' themes , he says he does n't want a `` multicultural '' france , etc. . . that 's just my personal opinion , it 's not clear but i wo n't expand more since it 's already a long post . 
  macron supporters do n't seem to think there 's any problem at all . 
  well i strongly disagree . ], 
  - ** benoit hamon is at 7,5 % ** he 's still campagning but is now certain he will lose . 
  his party is n't backing him . 
  maybe he 'll end up at 7 % or even 5 % . 
  sad !, 
  ( but logical ) . 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- other news : - ** there was a huge fire at the migrant camp of grande synthe ** thousands of migrants were rellocated . 
  - ** hooligans dirupted 2 football events ** stupid turkish football `` supporters '' attacked lyon supporters and equally stupid corsicans attacked lyon players . 
  it costs a fortune to protect these assholes but nevermind , it does n't seem to be considered a huge problem . 
  ( what if groups of women regularly attacked each other , requiring thousands of policemen to keep things in order ? 
  pretty sure it would n't be tolerated ... ) - ** hollande backs citizenship bid of 28 african war veterans ( `` senegalese tirailleurs '' ) ** - ** hollande commemorated the centenary of the battle of chemin des dames ** . 
  [ fingers crossed there wo n't be a terrorist attack in the next 3 weeks . 
  i 'll soon stop to bother you with my extensive posts  ],
