  then i assume you agree with her when she says that `` for years , france has been abused in people 's spirits , in reality we taught our children they had every reason to criticize it/her , to only see its darkest historical aspects . '', 
  the journalist 's question was prompted by the fact that her party ( as well as the les r\u00e9publicains party , by the way ) regularly criticizes the so-called `` historical repentance '' that history teachers supposedly feed french kids and call for coming back to teaching a `` national narrative '' focusing on the positive aspects of france 's history and its greatest historical figures , even if they are actually myths . 
  then you disagree with historians . 
  with the facts . 
  because the facts are that it 's the french government who signed the authorization . 
  but what she 's saying is that since the government of vichy had been put in place by the nazis , they did not represent the real french state ... 
  except no german soldier took part in this round-up of thousands of french jews , including children : french policemen complied . 
  she 's serving a biased/false ideology , according to which `` real france '' was part of the resistance . 
  except many french citizens denunced jews . 
  and on top of the thousands of french policemen who took part in this round-up , a few hundred french citizens also collaborated ... one of them later founded the national front . 
  her dad ( who still is the honorary president of her party ) has been condemned several times for holocaust denial and if you scrap just a little bit , you quickly find many neo-nazis among her supporters , including close friends of hers who are responsible for the funding of the national front ( by frauding , by the way ) . 
  tl ; dr : just read the parts in bold i guess . 
  apparently lots of spanish people have been following it on social media from the very start , but i thought a post could be interesting for the majority here who have n't heard of it yet . 
  it looks like it 's not going to die very soon . 
  ** it started just a week ago and it 's growing . 
  last night there were probably more than 2,000 people on `` place de la r\u00e9publique '' in paris . 
  a dozen other french cities have joined the movement , and also in brussels and li\u00e8ge ** ( and in spain as well ? ), 
  i have n't been there ( yet ) ( i do n't live in paris ) but i have been following it on social media and i can give you details ( before media coverage begins in your country ... probably this weekend ? ), 
  - ** how did it start ? 
  ** a week ago . 
  it was very small at first . 
  after protesting against the labour reform bill with thousands of other french people in the afternoon , ** a rather small group of activists decided to spend the night on place de la r\u00e9publique ** . 
  they called this movement `` nuit debout '' ( / `` standing night '' ) . 
  the hashtag rapidly became very popular on twitter , ** word got around , people spontaneously came to join them . 
  ** and again the next day ... and so on . 
  ** now people are coming to `` r\u00e9publique '' everyday from around 5pm to 1am . 
  ** there is a small group who spends the night and sleeps there but the vast majority comes after work , when they can . 
  ( on wednesday for instance it was raining so less people showed up but it was still pretty big . 
  and yesterday evening , weather permitting , the movement grew again ) . 
  maybe people will start a permanent camp soon . 
  authorities are probably starting to seriously freak out but if enough people decide that 's what they wan na do , i think it 's now likely to happen . 
  - ** why ? 
  what is it for ? 
  ** as i said , ** it started as an extension of the protests against the labour reform bill ** which is currently being presented in parliament and was met with strong opposition ( several `` traditional '' days of protests in france in the last month - ie : normal marches in the streets of major cities ) . 
  [ i already mentioned the opposition against this reform in `` what happened in your country this week '' threads . 
  i wo n't go into details again but you can imagine what people are angry about i guess : in short , right-wing law , by a `` socialist '' president whose program did n't mention anything of the sort , more precarity , social backward step ... ] ** but from the very beginning `` nuit debout '' was more than that . 
  it 's really similar to the movement of the `` indignados '' on la puerta del sol in 2011 . 
  people are talking about many many different things ** , it 's impossible to list them all but : ** the economy , working conditions , precarity , the environment , refugees , the state of emergency and so on ... ** it 's really diverse . 
  - what happens exactly ? 
  people gather after work and chat about all this ( heavy political discussions or completely laid-back chats . 
  overall it 's pretty laid-back and joyful ) . 
  then there is a daily general assembly where everyone can ask to talk on the mic ... to either simply express a general feeling about the state of the country , or to address a specific topic , or to suggest a concrete `` action '' . 
  from that on , numerous commitees are created each day : some people form a group to debate about a particular topic , others organize a specific event the next day ... 
  since yesterday there now is a radio ( `` radio debout '' ) and even a television ( `` tv debout '' ) . 
  - ** is it a political movement ? 
  ** ** well it is a social movement . 
  the topics discussed are political , but no political party ( or union ) is affiliated and people do n't want it to happen . 
  ** for instance , last month , a political documentary attracted lots of spectators : its director ( a left-wing journalist ) visited the `` nuit debout '' . 
  he was welcomed . 
  so were 1 or 2 other filmmakers who do the same kind of documentaries . 
  and so were syndicalists . 
  but a ( far - ) left-wing politician who also came to visit received a far less agreable welcome . 
  people really do n't want the movement to be hijacked by any party , be it left-wing . 
  [ at the moment , french people in general are really tired of seeing the same faces , really fed up with politicians in general , not only on the left ] . 
  - so is it a left-wing movement ? 
  well yes . 
  i heard people during the general assemblies say things like `` i do n't want nuit debout to be left or right , i talked about it with my conservative father and he was willing to listen to me when i stressed i was neither left-wing nor right-wing , please do n't politicize it , keep it like it is now . '', 
  but ... for me it clearly is a left-wing movement . 
  ( i understand what there people say , but objectively all the ideas discussed clearly are left-wing , people share basic principles . 
  everything is political and you ca n't ignore the minimal left/right gap for long when you have debates like these ) . 
  - ** where is it going ? 
  when and how will it end ? 
  ** ** difficult to tell but i think i can safely say already that this weekend is going to be huge ** because there is another national day of protest against the reform bill planned on saturday . 
  ( and on sunday there will be another march , in favour of farmers ( and more generally the environment ) . 
  - ** where can i learn more about it/follow the movement ? 
  ** nuit debout on twitter . 
  and on facebook and other social medias . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://twitter.com/remybuisine ) is on periscope almost each evening ( from around 7/8 pm-ish ) ( and he 's really good , he always stresses he 's just a spectator who films it so that everyone interested can see what it 's like and how it 's evolving ) . 
  you can see the replays from yesterday , tuesday and the nights before on his periscope . 
  ( 80,000 were following live on sunday and apparently it made it crash ) . 
  i think that 's pretty much it . 
  remember i am not part ofit , this is just a description from my perspective , watching it on social media . 
  feel free to add things ... and feel free to export it ( i heard there 's a protest in london on saturday ... wan na camp in front of downing street after the revelations about cameron ? ), 
  ( i guess it 's a bit too cold in reykjavik  but why not ? ), 
  as you all know , the first round of the french presidential election is today . 
  i hope you 're not too tired of hearing about it so much on this sub . 
  i thought you might like a casual post presenting what the internet came up with during these past few months . 
  * i 'm not going to explain all the serious stuff and expand on the context for each thing , so for this i suggest you refer yourselves to [ this megathread guide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62zaqd/french_presidential_election_summary/ ) for instance . 
  or you can ask me in the comments . 
  hopefully most things wo n't be lost in translation and you 'll be able to understand ` why it 's funny ' and smile .
