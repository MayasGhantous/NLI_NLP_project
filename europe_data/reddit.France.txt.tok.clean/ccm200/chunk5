  ** [ picture ] ( http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/bhl-a-nouveau-entarte-par-noel-godin-a-namur/article-normal-397811.html ) . 
  i 'm too lazy to sum up who bhl is , let 's just sum it up by saying he 's a self-important man who has a lot of friends amongst the french elites , which explains why he 's still invited on tv all the fucking time to explain how he can save the world , despite failing all the time . 
  and why french people , in their great majority , are extremely fed up with him . 
  - we also talked about the quotas of migrants in the eu . ), 
  poor elephant , locked in this cage , with these big metallic noises around him . 
  `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' now means `` do n't ever mention or show your religion in public , only at home '' . 
  that 's not what it originally meant ... people now use the word all the time ... and you never know what definition they have in mind at first . 
  usually it 's this one , which is completely wrong . 
  you are free to practise blasphemy in france ( to criticize and make fun of religions ) , but ironically now when you mention a religion it 's like you blaspheme against the sacrosanct `` republic '' . 
  it 's crazy . 
  it 's getting quite scary now actually . 
  ** france ** - ** hollande increased the defense budget by 4 billions ** . 
  ( the budget for until 2019 i think ) . 
  - ** qatar is going to buy 24 rafale combat jets . 
  ** we used to never sell any , now we get huge contracts every month !, 
  - ** 18 french soldiers are suspected of sexual abuse in central africa republic ** . 
  the accusations come from an united nations investigation . 
  the events happened between december 2013 and june 2014 and concern 10 boys , aged 8 to 15 . 
  a french investigation began in july but was not revealed publicly : a un worker leaked the information to the guardian this week . 
  - i mentioned the ** kidnapping of a 7-year old little girl , last week ** . 
  ( she was kidnapped by a stranger while she was riding her bicycle near her house . 
  8 hours later - after the broadcasting of an amber alert - he released her ) . 
  well ** they identified the suspect ** , thanks to dna found on the girls ' underwear . 
  he apparently did n't sexually abuse her though . 
  he 's a middle aged farmer , who was already on the list of sexual predators because he abused his niece ( s ) , and whose sister says he has always been very violent . 
  - however ** a 2 year-old baby boy is still missing ** . 
  edit : not anymore . 
  they found his body down a river this afternoon . 
  it 's been more than a week now and - strangely - i stopped hearing about it in the media since last sunday . 
  he could have drowned in the somewhat nearby river , or it was a kidnapping also : there were no eye witnesses at all . 
  - ** a 14 year old teen was shot dead ** in trappes ( paris suburbs ) , two days ago . 
  apparently it 's a collateral victim in a ` gang ' related conflict . 
  i heard something about a dog : inhabitants saying it was not related to drugs ( as we could expect when hearing the news ) , but the consequence of a quarrel about a dog biting someone a long time ago . 
  tragic . 
  - i think the story actually happened several days/weeks ago , but it got ( light ) mainstream media coverage this week : ** a teenage girl got into trouble at her school for wearing a long skirt ** . 
  of course you 've all guessed it : she 's maghrebi and she 's muslim . 
  it 's real , it 's not the onion . 
  france the country of the rights of men , the one that has `` liberty , equality , fraternity '' written on its shools ' facades . 
  you see , in france women have to conform to this other motto : `` neither prostitutes nor submissives '' - no short skirts , you 're a provocative whore ; no long skirts , you 're a provocative proselyte . 
  - ** friday , on the 1st of may , we mostly heard about the ~ ~ trade unions ' marches ~ ~ . 
  of course not : as usual , we heard about the front national !, 
  they traditionally have a rally on mayday and 2 things happened : ** topless femen disrupted marine le pen 's speech . 
  ** two of them emerged from the crowd when marine le pen was laying a wreath in honour of joan of arc ( joa is frequently used as a nationalist symbol by the party ) . 
  later , during her speech , 3 other femen made nazi salutes and displayed `` heil hitler '' flags from a balcony . 
  they were violently seized by front national security guys , who managed to enter the hotel room where the femen were before the police . 
  ** jean-marie le pen appeared on stage although he was not supposed to . 
  ** the father and daughter have been on especially bad terms recently and they marched separately , they did n't acknowledge each other 's presence . 
  why is that ? 
  jean-marie le pen made comments about ww2 , again , a few weeks ago . 
  and news about a secret account of his ( 2 million euros ) in switzerland emerged recently too . 
  far-right protesters and a prominent fn leader also violently attacked several news media crews during that gathering . 
  so that 's fn in a nutshell for ya . 
  ( guess which politician they invited today for the big one-hour political itw hosted by 3 news media on sundays ? 
  ... correct !, 
  ( no they do not ask her - or any other politician - the good questions : the `` journalists '' let the person run the itw as they please ) . 
  apart from that , the news were mostly the earthquake in yemen & the riots in baltimore ... and of course the royal baby !!, 
  he was declared guilty in indonesia , but his trial apparently was n't fair ( i heard he did n't even have a translator for instance ) . 
  his lawyer says he 's convinced of his client 's innocence , but that 's his job i guess . 
  so i do n't know , he may be guilty but i doubt the evidence presented during the trial would be considered valid here . 
  it was on france 2 , monday at 8pm i think . 
  ( david pujadas is the journalist who interviewed him . 
  he 's not particularly good in my opinion , that 's why i doubt anything interesting came out of it , plus i 'm not in favour of publicizing dictators ' propaganda ) . 
  i have n't heard anything of the sort . 
  but i have n't been following the news extremely closely either . 
  i think most people in france would say that recognizing a genocide and being the only european head of state to show up for the 100th commemorations is a good thing , but i also read the usual stupid comments you read on the internet , along the lines of `` why does he care about stuff that happened abroad a long time ago ? 
  french people are suffering because of his politics right now ! '' . 
  people are n't that interested in foreign politics in general , but people who do care thought he did the good thing i presume . 
  ** france ** - ** a man planning to attack church ( es ) was arrested last sunday ** after he shot himself in the leg and called for medical help . 
  you probably all read about it already so i wo n't develop a lot on the way he was arrested ( afer he allegedly killed an innocent woman , trying to steal her car ) . 
  the most recent things i heard on television ( which you may not have heard about , and may not be correct - ie : journalists `` reporting '' on what investigators supposedly told them ) are that the investigators think he may have been part of a group of 5 or 6 people ( maybe more ) planning on two attacks at the same time ( similar to the ones in january : two teams attacking different locations at the same time , 1 or 2 church ( es ) in villejuif and another attack we do n't know about ) . 
  they are still investigating : a female relative ( maybe his ( ex ) girlfriend ) has been interrogated . 
  two brothers living in the suburbs of paris are said to be potential accomplices , as well as a man he welcomed at his apartment last weekend . 
  but apparently they have n't been caught . 
  finally , a man he exchanged messages wih is in syria . 
  the suspect denied all accusations and remains silent , refusing to speak to the investigators . 
  edit : so 3 men have been arrested this weekend . 
  thanks to dna found either in the suspect 's car or in his apartment . 
  they may be accomplices or simply relatives of him . 
  the name of one of these 3 men appeared in the facebook conversations between the main suspect and the guy in syria who asked him to target churches . 
  - ** a 7 year-old little girl was kidnapped and set free 8 hours later . 
  ** she was not physically nor sexually abused : her kidnapper dropped her in front of a house two hours away from her home . 
  he still has n't been caught . 
  an amber alert was broadcasted on all radio stations and television channels , which might have been what made him release her . 
  - ** another child , a two-year old boy , has been missing since friday . 
  ** ( this time the amber-alert has not been activated because a kidnapping is n't the only hipothesis : he went missing near a river and there are n't any eye witness testimonies ) . 
  investigations are still ongoing . 
  - ** a french citizen convicted of drug offenses may be executed in indonesia . 
  ** the french diplomacy tried all week to pressure the indonesian authorithies and his name finally is n't on the list of the next 9 people to be executed . 
  - ** hollande was the only european head of state to attend the armenian genocide commemorations . 
  ** i think that 's pretty much it . 
  edit : no . 
  - ** a replica of the chauvet cave opened yesterday . 
  ** [ 36 000 years old prehistoric art ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otpwdyp-x14 ) . 
  - ** bachar al assad was interviewed on the main public channel this week . 
  ** i did n't watch it . 
   personally i would be in favour of banishing the 35 hour week in france and replace it for a 40-45 hour week , which is much lower than what people work in the most developed countries us , england , etc. 
  hum there are lots of them !, 
  let 's see . 
  ( it 's long so i put the most `` important '' ones in italics , it 's subjective but i think these are the ones that have been the most important and will be relevant in the near future ) . 
  on the right , * jupp\u00e9 * and * sarkozy * are leading according to polls for the primary in november .
