  he also appears a bit old-fasioned , disconnected from the reality ( or from the young generation ) and cold . 
  but these are n't major issues for now at least . 
  on the contrary , people generally view him as one of the last remaining `` gaullist figure '' : a real head of state stature . 
  ( however , now that the media has changed a lot , it 's going to be tough for him to adapt to the way things work nowadays . 
  meaning he 's ` stiff '' and looks pretty ridiculous whenever his team tries to portray him as a dynamic man in order to appeal to the young generation . 
  he makes little effort when journalists ask `` funny '' questions , make jokes or bombard him with questions , etc. . . 
  i do n't know if you see what i mean ) .

   in what party is emmanuel macron ? 
  the socialists ? 
  good question , i should have mentioned it , my post is n't very clear indeed . 
  ( sorry this is going to be very long , hopefully i 'll manage to explain things well enough ) : ** emmanuel macron is n't a member of the socialist party . 
  ** he did have his card there between 2006 and 2009 but he did n't renew his membership after that . 
  ( during the 2007 presidential election , he was favorable to an alliance between s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royal - candidate for the socialist party , and hollande 's wife at the time - and fran\u00e7ois bayrou - candidate for the modem , center . 
  sarkozy won the election . 
  then , for the 2012 presidential election , macron supported hollande , who gave him a post in his staff , as secretary general in the elys\u00e9e . 
  in 2014 , the ps asked him to be a candidate in the municipal election in his native region but he declined : since he did n't have any electoral mandate anywhere , hollande decided not to appoint him in the ministry of budget . 
  a few months later he is nevertheless appointed minister of the economy ) . 
  so he 's not a member of the ps and never took part in any election , which is quite rare . 
  ** he 's clearly on the right ** ( and several right-wing politicians have said he could have his place in the future goverment if the right wins - particularly if jupp\u00e9 wins ) . 
  but he says he 's faithful to hollande , the one who helped him start in politics . 
  ** he claims he 's a left-wing reformist who wants to work with anyone willing to revigorate french politics . 
  ** ( by the way , several of hollande 's ministers have been fired for expressing their disappointment in the government being too right-leaning . 
  so the fact that macron launches his own movement now - basically saying `` what the government i 'm part of is doing is not good , not enough '' - is `` weird '' : others have been fired for their criticism of hollande but for macron it 's okay ... ) as i wrote , it 's really not clear what his plans are . 
  he said he wants his new `` movement '' to encourage voters ( from the left and from the right ) to regain faith in politics again . 
  it 's very likely he wants to be a candidate in 2022 , but it would also not be surprising to see him candidate sooner ... next year . 
  the presidential election will take place in april/may of next year . 
  les r\u00e9publicains will have their primary in november ( there already are about 15 candidates : alain jupp\u00e9 is leading in front of nicolas sarkozy - who is not officially running yet but will be ) . 
  but on the left it 's much more complicated : hollande has always said he wants to be reelected ( but will announce his candidacy at the last minute ) . 
  however his popularity is * extremely * low ( 8/10 of the french do n't want him to be part of the race ) and thus all the other politicians on the left have been asking for a primary ( which is in the statuses of the ps : there should be a primary according to their principles ) . 
  hollande and valls have been trying to delay and abort the primary for months , but they finally realized they have to accept it ... but they say they want hollande to be the only candidate for the socialist party !!!, 
  what they want is a primary between the ps and the greens , with hollande against one green candidate !, 
  all the `` real left-wing '' policiticians obviously object : they want hollande to participate in a primary against a candidate from the greens , but also against any other politician from the left of the socialist party . 
  the battle is ongoing : there will be national conventions in june where militants are probably going to express their disapproval very vocally . 
  but hollande may well get what he wants ( counter all his opponents on the left ) . 
  it ai n't going to be pretty . 
  outside of the socialist party , there are other parties on the left , but they are small : / therefore the nuit debout movement comes at the right time ( well is n't it too late ? ), 
  but since they are very weary and defiant towards the traditional politicians and political system , if they carry on refusing to take part in the actual system , their movement could end up not having any impact on the next election . 
  hope that was n't too complex  basically we already know marine le pen has extremely high chances of being in the second turn of the presidential election next year . 
  will she be against alain jupp\u00e9 ( or someone else on the right ? 
  it seems like the left will collapse . 
  ( plus many people will choose the blank vote , or not vote at all ) . 
  france : - ** nuit debout , a social movement of contestation launched 9 days ago , is growing : thousands of people gather on place de la r\u00e9publique in paris every evening ** , and in lots of other cities of france ( also abroad ) . 
  it would be long to explain . 
  [ this article ] ( https://roarmag.org/essays/nuit-debout-republique-occupation/ ) in english explains it pretty well ( note that it is 3 days old ) . 
  [ this statement ] ( https://www.convergence-des-luttes.org/appel-nuit-debout/nuit-debouts-call-place-de-la-republique-paris-8th-april-2016/ ) , also in english , from their website explains the main ideas behind it . 
  i 'm gon na copy and paste a brief description :  the #nuitdebout occupations are structured in a very similar way to those of the 15-m movement in spain , with participatory decision-making structures and the belief that people should have a much greater say in democratic processes . 
   our mobilisation was initially aimed at protesting against the french labour law . 
  this reform is not an isolated case , since it comes as a new piece in the austerity measures which already affected our european neighbours [ ... ] the debates taking place in the assemblies on republic square prove that the general exasperation goes way beyond the labour law and opens a more global issue : the reconsideration of a social and political system stuck into a deep crisis and on its way out . 
  people are mostly discussing various political/social issues , either in a daily big general assembly or in specific `` commissions '' or in informal small groups around the place . 
  but they also organize concrete actions . 
  and of course they took part in the national protests against the labor reform . 
  there is no leader . 
  people do n't want any political party affiliation . 
  how long it will last is difficult to say right now but it clearly is n't going to stop in the next few days . 
  where it is going to lead is even tougher to anticipate : as i said , people strongly oppose any political figure trying to `` infiltrate '' it but what to do next so that the movement reaches more people and leads to concrete changes is being debated every day . 
  you can follow it through social media , using the hashtag `` nuitdebout '' ( [ @nuitdebout ] ( https://twitter.com/nuitdebout ) ) ; there are also lots of people who stream it live via periscope ( possibly on facebook live as well ) , [ this guy ] ( https://twitter.com/remybuisine ) was the first and one of the best ; there 's [ tv debout ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzbxhukvure&amp;app=desktop ) and [ radio debout ] ( http://mixlr.com/radiodebout/ ) ; and plenty of twitter accounts and facebook pages for local `` nuits debout '' . 
  - ** hundreds of thousands people marched against the labor reform yesterday . 
  ** the police says 120,000 in france , but the unions say 110,000 in paris only ( and have n't given a national estimation yet ) . 
  - ** the election rules changed : more power for the big parties ( i.e less democratic ) . 
  ** the parliament modified how media coverage before the election works ( one year before the presidential race ) . 
  all parties ( big or small ) had to receive the same mediatic treatment ( meaning as much screen and radio time for the socialist party , r\u00e9publicains , national front , greens and lots of smaller others ) . 
  it is no longer the case : the treatment will be `` equitable '' / `` fair '' ... meaning that how much time they are allowed is going to be decided according to what percentage of the votes they had during the last election and also according to `` polls projections '' !, 
  = chances for an emerging party or figure to emerge diminished . 
  it 's totally undemocratic . 
  - ** panama papers . 
  ** in france the revelations have honestly been pretty disappointing , in the sense that we already knew about almost all the people named : investigations are already undergoing or investigations already led to a trial happening quite soon . 
  hollande congratulated whistleblowers which is very hypocritical since he never offered assange , snowden or several french whistleblowers any real help and we are still waiting for a law to protect them . 
  and of course he was hypocritical too when he said fighting offshore societies and tax evasion is crucial . 
  yes he did change things a little bit but nowhere near enough . 
  - ** emmanuel macron , minister of the economy , launched his own `` movement '' . 
  ** i do n't know if many of you are going to be interested but this is quite important : you 'll hear about him in the future for sure ( unless he really screws up ) . 
  i 'll do my best to portray him : emmanuel macron is a former investment banker ( at rothschild 's ) whose progression in politics has been quite impressive . 
  nobody had heard of him 2 years ago and he now appears to be a possible credible candidate for the presidency !, 
  the media love him . 
  it is true that he 's really quite charismatic , especially compared to all the other politicians ( the french are * really * tired with all of the old faces and want a new generation ) . 
  he 's young and good around cameras ( a bit like obama who can afford to act in ways others ca n't : both obama and macron are n't ridiculous when they make jokes or take part in `` happenings '' ... unlike the others ) . 
  politically he 's clearly on the right , but he and hollande always said he 's a `` left-wing reformist '' , a `` social democrat '' etc. . . ( he mostly talks about the economy so we really do n't have a precise idea of what he thinks about other major subjects ) . 
  when he launched his `` movement '' this week he said `` it will be neither right-wing nor left-wing '' . 
  it 's only a `` movement '' and not a party . 
  he does n't want to be a candidate next year ( he 's `` behind hollande , he knows what he ows to him '' ) ... well what is it for then you may ask ? 
  - um ... good question . 
  i really do n't know what he has in mind . 
  many people really think he should be a candidate next year for the presidential election , but officially that 's not his intention ( probably in 5 years then ? ), 
  i think it 's quite possible that he tries to counter the socialist party ( which is in really bad shape ) and it could really be successful . 
  it would mean betraying hollande , but hollande prefers macron to his pm valls so who knows what will happen when hollande will * finally * realize he has 0 chance of being reelected ... . 
  personally , being really left-wing , i really do n't want him and i think he 's quite `` dangerous '' for the left ( many people who say they are socialist voters are ready to vote for macron , according to polls . 
  many others are n't but since there are n't a lot of big names on the left for next year 's presidential race , someone like macron could siphon a lot of votes ) . 
  - ** mohamed abrini and others have been arrested ** . 
  you probably already know so i wo n't expand . 
  - ** a court ruled that a gay slur aimed at a hairdresser was ` not homophobic ' ** . 
  it did happen . 
  [ article in english ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35994755 ) . 
  - ** several cases of paedophilia in the diocese of lyon have emerged in the last month or so : cardinal and archbishop barbarin did n't denounce the priests . 
  ** the cases are n't that old : in the 90s and even 00s ( i 'm saying this cause we heard lots of `` but it was another mentality back then , nobody talked about it and the public debate was non existent '' well in the 80s definitely , but this is a shitty argument here ) . 
  young boys and teenage girls are the victims . 
  i do n't remember how many victims there are at the moment . 
  google it if you are interested . 
  babarin 's defense was quite `` poor '' ... but he did admit his responsabilities even though his excuses have been very disappointing .
