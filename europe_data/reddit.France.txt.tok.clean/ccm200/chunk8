  * i know there is something else i wanted to mention , it 's on the tip of my tongue but i ca n't remember  *, 
  which is better than you . 
  oh i 'm so sorry you had to waste 2 seconds of your life reading this irrelevant sentence and 4 more seconds typing this comment . 
  probably the reason why you did n't have the time to answer the question yourself ... we 'll never know what happened in norway this week !, 
  ** france ** : - ** protest against the proposed new labour law ** : after expressing their opposition online , french people protest on the streets . 
  the online petition - launched 3 weeks ago - reached 1 250 000 signatures . 
  but everybody was waiting to see how many people would join the street protest : 250 000 to 500 000 french citizens protested on wednesday . 
  ( 250 000 according to the police , 500 000 according to the unions ) . 
  which is really quite something , especially since it was a week day and the weather was n't good . 
  it 's a start : other protests are programmed , we 'll see how it goes . 
  the government - afraid of a growing movement , especially amongst the youth - met with all the unions and `` agreed to negociate '' a little bit , but all in all everybody remained on its initial position . 
  ( according to most polls , 70 % of french people are against this bill . ), 
  - ** switzerland and germany express fear about ( aging ) french nuclear plant ** . 
  - ** number of candidates for the national police exam `` explodes '' ** ( no pun intended ) . 
  after the terrorist attacks obviously . 
  ( lots of people also joined the military ) . 
  - ** hollande ( `` quietly '' ) gave the l\u00e9gion d'honneur to saudi prince ** . 
  the prince met with basically all the government , but strangely all these meetings were not mentioned on the ministers ' schedules ... everything was done so that journalists would not cover the visit . 
  ~ ~ other things you already know about : ~ ~ [ edit : irrelevant to this thread , and forces people to use precious seconds of their time to tell me they did n't understand this previous sentence .

  oh : - ** michel drucker , famous tv host , announced the end of his show ... 
  finally !, 
  ** he 's one of the most popular tv people in france ( but only old people watch his shows ) . 
  he 's nice and all , but a bit annoying because he 's too nice all the time ( he never criticises anyone and raves about being friends with everybody ) . 
  i did n't mind him still being on tv , lots of people like and watch him , but it 's good to see a bit of change and new programs and faces on tv . 
  ** france ** : - main topic is the same as last week : ** the new labour law ( soon to be presented before the parliament ) meets strong opposition . 
  ** - it 's a very radical reform that hollande hopes to pass in the final year of his mandate . 
  even right-wing politicians and editorialists recognize that sarkozy would n't have dared presenting such a law . 
  - an online petition against the bill gathered 878 000 signatures in just one week and a half ( as of today , we 'll see if/when it reaches a million . 
  it is unprecedented ) . 
  the hashtag `` on vaut mieux que \u00e7a '' / `` we deserve better than this '' ( or maybe something along the lines of `` we are worth more than this '' ) has been popular on french social medias this week . 
  it was launched by a group of youtubers who encouraged people to be vocal about their experiences at work ( stress , working conditions , job insecurity ... ) and to protest against this bill ( these youtubeurs are n't even that popular mind you , they have political orientated channels that do n't have that many viewers , i had n't heard about most of them before . ), 
  - protests are going to take place next wednesday . 
  it also looks like a student movement may be starting in the universities , but wait and see . 
  - the presentation of the law has been delayed by two weeks ( 24rth instead of the 9th of march ) . 
  - ( i also wrote in my comment last week about the labour minister saying she would pass the law even if there was no majority to vote it , using a special anti-democratic amendment ( called 49-3 ) . 
  well : she took it back the next day . 
  it will be debated in the assembly ) . 
  [ personal editorial , if you are interested : i do n't really know at this stage : there 's this stereotype about the french going on strikes and organizing protests all the time , but the truth is , since hollande came in power no social protest managed to gain a lot of attention : people are - like in many other countries - more and more disappointed by politics , defiant , angry ... but it generates strong apathy and disillusionment ( rather than a willpower to protest and organize a collective movement ) . 
  now that the president is * supposed to be * left-wing , it 's even more difficult to criticise his policies ( the left is not supposed to fight against the left by advocating for more social justice , militants have trouble convincing people to join their movement ( s ) ) . 
  but this apathy regarding politics started before ( sarkozy liked to repeat that `` nowadays when the french are protesting , nobody notices '' ) : there 's this idea that politicians just wo n't listen , no matter how many people take the streets ( we recently saw what happened in greece for instance ) . 
  so people talk about it a lot , there definitely is a strong opposition in the opinion , there 's a petition online , a hashtag , there will be protests but i really doubt it will be massive . 
  the question at this date is whether or not the movement will spread and last : new protests programmed after the ones scheduled for next wednesday ? 
  strikes in universities ( quite frequent in france : it has to be big and to last to mean something ) ? 
  most journalists go with the `` people believe the lies they have been told about this text , they have n't read the 130 pages , they do n't understand it '' propaganda . 
  ( there 's also `` people who oppose the text are workers who fight to preserve their rights , they are selfish towards the millions of unemployed people who wished they had a job . '' ), 
  regarding our representatives ( they are the ones who will decide for us ) : it 's the same scenario we 've seen in the last 4 years . 
  hollande annouces a right-wing law  the left protests , but most of our left-wing representatives want to vote in favour of the government  a vocal minority of our representatives express strong opposition  the right annouces they wanted to vote the law but wo n't anymore if it moves by an inch  we pretend the debate happened and the law is voted ... 
  so how many of our socialist representatives will vote in favour of this bill this time ? 
  ( now that the presidential and legislative elections are approaching ? 
  now that hollande and valls still have n't managed to reconcile with the opinion ( their approval ratings are 17 % and 29 % : it 's been exceptionally law in the last years , but they do n't care ) ? 
  how long will the parliamentary debates last ? 
  ( and will they be affected by the ongoing debate about the deprival of citizenship , which is soon to be debated at the senate ? ), 
  i 'm not optimistic . 
  i doubt a big and lasting social movement will emerge . 
  i think the text will be , once again , changed a little but it will pass . ], 
  - ** the annual agricultural show is being held in paris . 
  it 's traditionally a political event : who is insulted , who is applauded ? 
  ** politicians who take the risk of going there are mostly met by hordes of angry farmers ( do n't worry though , they are surrounded by security and hundreds of journalists ) . 
  politicians who do n't go are labelled as cowards . 
  journalists compare how many hours each one spent . 
  this year , of course , hollande was insulted . 
  the next day valls was insulted too . 
  the day after , marine le pen spent 10 hours there , telling farmers exactly what they wanted to hear . 
  ( other , minor , politicians still have to do their duty and visit . 
  it 's pretty pathetic but it 's an annual thing ) . 
  - ** part of the `` jungle '' in calais started being dismantled . 
  ** - ** the cesar ceremony ( french equivalent to the oscars ) gave out its awards ** . 
  the 2 main winners were : * fatima * , about a single mother who emigrated from morocco and works as a maid , trying to help her daughters finish their education . 
  * mustang * , which was also nominated at the oscars and is about the fate of 5 teenage sisters facing the patriarchal rules in their turkish village/family . 
   italy first nation to create task force for cultural heritage protection . 
  great !, 
  ** france ** : - ** the labor minister presented the first draft of her bill to `` reform '' the labor law ( hollande 's last major piece of legislation before the end of his mandate ) : it 's scary . 
  ** i 'm not going to expand much on this , as there are many things to say if you want to understand the details . 
  to sum up , it 's yet another big betrayal from our '' '' `` socialist '' '' '' government , doing worse than what sarkozy and the right ever dreamed doing . 
  of course left-wing people and unions are very very critical about 90 % of the proposals . 
  but honestly we are n't that surprised now - even if it goes much further than what we could imagine just a few weeks ago , and even if it 's totally totally the opposite of what the `` left '' is supposed to fight for - and so i doubt people will be protesting in the streets , although we really should . 
  anyway the minister already announced that she will pass the law even if there is no majority in parliament to vote it ( i do n't know how many time hollande has used this anti-democratic amendment in the last 4 years , i lost count . 
  more than sarkozy ) . 
  ( lots of people are saying that the government is announcing drastic measures now so that when they back up and eventually present a smaller plan , everyone will be saying `` oh well , that 's better than what they announced at first , let 's be grateful they did n't totally scrap our rights ! '', 
  it 's very plausible indeed , but if they keep it that way and pass it without a vote in parliament i would n't be surprised . ), 
  - ** sarkozy has been placed under formal investigation over suspected illegal financing of his 2012 presidential campaign . 
  ** this too is a long story to sum up if you need the details , so i wo n't be going into the whole bygmalion case here . 
  but in short : in 2012 , his party spent roughly twice the legal amount for sarkozy 's presidential campaign ( many enormous and expensive meetings hidden from the official accounts thanks to the company organizing them - called bygmalion ) . 
  judges are investigating to see who knew : but it looks like they ca n't prove sarkozy knew ( although he f ****** signed the papers for f *** 's sake , when you sign something you should be held responsible ! ), 
  he risks a 1 year ** suspended ** prison sentence and a 3,500 euros fine . 
  ( so unless i 'm stupid , it means you can illegally spend 25 millions to win the presidential race , say you had other things to do than check the details , ask your supporters to pay your debt - donations that are elligible for tax reduction , i.e all taxpayers pay , not only * your * voters - and be candidate for a second mandate 5 years later . 
  is n't that great ? ), 
  being officially under investigation is detrimental for the upcoming primary , but it does n't look like this is going to be a major problem for him . 
  - ** the agricultural crisis continues ( more protests this week ) . 
  the government promised farmers a few things . 
  ** this is probably the end of this cycle . 
  it will resume in a few months ...  - ** several protests in corsica this week , following an `` altercation '' between corsican football supporters and the police a few days ago . 
  ** a young football supporter said he was shot in the eye by a flash ball ( after his team won a match on the mainland ) . 
  the police has a different version : he allegedly hurt himself .
