except when it comes to economy . 
  or any other metric of a countries ' wellness . 
   what 's the trait they share among themselves ? 
  these countries do not tolerate immigrants that refuse to integrate . 
  yeah , clearly , that 's the only trait they share that contrasts with france ... 
  lol . 
  you should try consuming some actual information instead of reddit propaganda . 
  poor , younger people living in disenfranchised areas . 
  why ? 
   not a single humanitarian organization claimed that this `` hospital '' was used or with civilians inside . 
  also : lol . 
  this just goes to show how crazily different the spin is between pro-putin news and the rest . 
  not really . 
  for instance , the recent deliberate destruction of hospital facilities in aleppo has made the rounds of virtually every news organization ... 
  all over the news . 
  from what i understand , they 'd fall in the `` orange '' category . 
  and malta , in europe , already bans it entirely ( also the vatican , obviously ) . 
  `` how incest is europe ? '', 
  pretty incest i guess . 
  yes , because the western world would * never * consider voting in authoritarian governments these days . 
  why do you have to make it about nationality/ethnicity ? 
  yeah and she does n't even use protection she just plans to get one of them free abortions we love so much in the west . 
  but ok , i got ta admit it was kind of a dick move from amir not to bring fatima with him , but since he drowned alongside a boatful of terrified people off the coast of a foreign country maybe it was for the best ? 
  i suppose because sometimes amir is fleeing death/a torn country with no future and irina just wants to get a slightly better-paying job and dick from dutch exchange students . 
  caricature and gratuitous personalization do n't make very strong arguments . 
  those are the tragedies i am referring to , and which do not , to me , warrant sacrificing the freedoms of the entire people . 
  i meant voters vs people who engineered brexit . 
  i doubt they share a lot of interests in this case . 
  but yeah if talking about voters , it 's definitely true . 
  for voters that fell victim to incessant fearmongering , sure . 
  for the higher ups , certainly not . 
  `` shitshow '' , right ... our lives have n't changed one bit . 
  as terrible as they are , a handful of tragedies is not a reason to give up every freedom we have as a people . 
  count all the stuff . 
  count all the people . 
  divide the number of stuff by the number of people . 
   except beer ... why ? 
  just because you like beer ? 
   i would be scared if i was lgbt and in those countries you 're not . 
  that 's the point . 
  he said he wanted to protect them ... from the bad , bad muslim ideology that threatens us with total annihilation and should make us very very scared all the time and vote for extremists . 
  why not ? 
  do n't you like free speech ? 
  do you need your opinions validated ? 
  maybe you want a safe space where dissent is squashed and censorship reigns supreme , like / r/the _ donald ? 
  there is absolutely no reason to think the polling error during the first turn of the primaries would translate to the same error during the second turn of the presidential election in a completely different context . 
  ... do you really not see how obvious that is ? 
  i 'm not bitching . 
  i think it 's great . 
  people around me are starting to treat polls with more distance and vote for who they want instead of trying to do so strategically or renouncing to vote because they think the results are decided . 
  i hope this polling uncertainly lasts and pollsters do n't adjust their models too quickly . 
  i think we mostly agree , i was being overly dramatic in my first comment . 
  while i do think polls are in fact currently less reliable , i do n't think they are pointless or necessarily off . 
  but you certainly can not say today with certainty that fillon would crush lepen . 
  your very argument regarding the primary applies here to a lesser extend . 
  the political landscape in france has rather dramatically shifted during the last two/three presidential terms , and voting patterns are changing , as evidenced by the latest legislative elections . 
  the current models are less relevant . 
  it 's more complicated than that . 
  when virtually every poll shows the same error , it 's not a matter of individual margin of error , it 's a polling upset . 
  and these seem to be happening more frequently in western democracies lately , for multiple suspected reasons . 
  also , 10 % is generally not considered the standard margin of error . 
  it 's massive . 
  in the most recent decades , it 's been 2-3 % . 
  you can just look at what analysts and pollsters themselves are saying . 
  many recognize there is a problem and are working on rethinking their methods . 
  538 for instance has a lot of articles on this topic after their multiple failures to accurately predict major recent votes . 
  exemple : http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-missed-trump-we-asked-pollsters-why/, 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  let me get my crystal ball . 
  i do n't know why the other guys are being such massive douches about this . 
  yes , merah is extremely well-known in france , and has been talked about a lot recently , hence the surprise i assume . 
  but it is perfectly understandable that you would n't know about him . 
  i 'd even say it 's good . 
  there is no need for this guy 's name to reach posterity . 
  ignore these guys . 
   and all polls shows he wins against le pen . 
  and polls are so fucking trustworthy , right ? 
  and it 's not just trump and brexit . 
  a week ago fillon was polling ** third ** , at ** 20 % ** , for the primaries . 
  this is what the map looked like after the vote : http://www.lemonde.fr/image/2016/11/21/534x0/5034792_6_d9db_2016-11-20-abb1699-15570-136dp3e-3nk6pf1or_fd324869254176d7450602a8aecb63fe.png it seems these days polls are n't reliable at all a week from a vote . 
  a hypothetical fillon vs le pen is months ahead . 
  this is a very childish opinion . 
  fillon is n't an idiot , and his adversary jupp\u00e9 is widely recognized as being extremely smart . 
  hollande looks and talk like a fucking clown , but he 's not dumb either . 
  things are a bit more nuanced than that . 
  and sarkozy has n't been convicted yet , but it 's clear to everyone he 's done even worse . 
  france , like many western countries , is having a serious crisis of representation . 
   if he 's good on immigration then gays would come out ahead ... lol what ? 
  are you one of these `` migrants are coming over to kill our gays '' type ? 
  it 's refreshing to see a german say that . 
   anti-gay i believe this is mostly posturing to appeal to the very vocal social conservatives in france . 
  he 'll delay adoption/ivf , but otherwise will keep the status quo . 
  however , he is indeed an unapologetic ultraliberal , and '' '' `` pragmatic '' '' '' regarding international policy - which means pro-putin/assad . 
  or just make some actual food if you 're going to be cooking eggs anyway . 
  you guys are cute . 
  i * really * like this new series of posts . 
  it 's funny , interesting , a learning opportunity , and it totally subverts the typical , clich\u00e9 `` localization pride '' of geography-based subs . 
  it 's not what he said . 
  it 's basically the opposite .
