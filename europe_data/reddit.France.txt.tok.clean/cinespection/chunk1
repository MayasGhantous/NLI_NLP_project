i am not implying that these make perfect sense , i am implying that terrorism was not the only driving force behind these laws . 
  -------- if you want my opinion on the subject , then i think that the only sane thing to do is to reduce the demand for ( illegal ) guns . 
  to go back to my example of the gun related crimes in france , they pretty much all have to deal with drug trafficking , similarly to the mafia in italy . 
  i think that de-penalizing drugs and sending drug addicts to rehab instead of prison ( maybe even legalizing , controlling and selling them like alcohol is ) will stop crimes related to drugs . 
  i believe swiss is doing something similar ? 
  if drug related crimes stop , the demand for illegal guns to commit those crimes also stops , which leads to fewer illegal guns entering the continent . 
  i do wish for a eu wide relaxation on drug laws , but then , the european parliament is not populated with people who can do basic maths like that . 
  then terrorism is a special case . 
  for example , apart from everyone 's favourite religion , the basque separatists are/were also pretty active in terrorism , as well as the corsican in france . 
  those need to be dealt with on a case by case scenario . 
  i know that i 'm french and that i am not supposed to speak ( proper ) english but let 's look at my sentence you quoted :  the law might not not talk about illegal weapons comming in but his comment sure does : this was in response to someone ( a tad ignorant , but there is nothing wrong with it here ) who asked me why i talk about illegal weapons all of a sudden , because they thought i brought the subject about illegal weapons out of my ass . 
  i used the auxiliary `` might '' . 
  as far as i know ( i.e. 
  correct me if i am wrong ) , `` might '' is typically used to point that something may or may not occur or be , or may or may have occurred or been . 
  meaning that there is a probability that some event have happened or that there is a probability that it has not , therefore let us be on the safe side and let us not draw any conclusions about the aforementioned event . 
  so my sentence you quoted could have been read as follows : `` the law does not talk about illegal weapons but he does '' or : `` both the law and op talk about illegal weapons . 
  '' showing that in any case , you talked about illegal weapons , and illegal weapons were the subject , and therefore it does not matter whether the law was written with illegal weapons in mind or not . 
  ------------  as far as i know , the terrorists did n't apply for gun licenses in your country , did they ? 
  hi , captain obvious !, 
  though if we consider all possible scenarios , they could have obtained the weapons from someone who has licenses . 
  or from swiss . 
  ( notice the usage of `` * could * '' ) . 
  can you buy ak-47 's in swiss ? 
  if not , would you have asked the same question if the event happened in swiss ? 
  you or the article could also have taken note of the fact that the majority of the gun related crimes in france ( and possibly other eu countries ) are committed using unregistered weapons . 
  so there is more to it than the paris attack , which is barely used as an incentive for this law or others in the same area ( cf `` the loophole which became evident in the aftermath of last year 's terrorist attacks in paris '' which is talked about in the article ) . 
   they claim this is to prevent terrorism terrorism is not the only matter here , merely a motivation to try to figure out ( half-arsed ) measures . 
   but instead of concentrating efforts in tackling the illegal gun problem from outside europe now that i think about it , i am pretty sure that some guns are legal in some countries ( like swiss ) and illegal in others ( like france ) . 
  so perhaps the illegal guns situation is not just about what comes unregistered from outside of europe ? 
   they decided to use it as a way to push an agenda to fuck legal gun owners in the ass . 
  i do n't think there is an agenda specifically designed to `` fuck legal gun owner in the ass '' . 
  since such attitude is being visible in other domain , such as cryptocurrency lately , - or rather money laundering ( hallo switzerland ! ), 
  used as an excuse to control cryptocurrency and block-chains in general , - it is more about fucking every one who is not in power in the ass . 
   it 's typical anti-gunner logic where a bunch of terrorists with illegal guns kill a bunch of people and the way to solve the problem is by making legal guns even more restrictive ( despite the extremely restrictive gun laws in europe as a whole ) . 
  there are pro-gunners who share the same logic . 
  even in france , some people think we should have the right to own guns , as a defense , with some restrictions to avoid e.g. 
  military grade weapons to proliferate , or mentally unstable people to own weapons . 
  you just happen to be an extremist who wants all or nothing . 
   but this law does not deal in any way with illegal guns coming in . 
  why does someone who is against this law need to present arguments for a totally unrelated issue ? 
  the law might not talk about illegal weapons but his comment sure does :  [ it will do absolutely nothing to tackle the problem of illegal guns coming from eastern europe and northern africa .

  * you * just do n't want to argue . 
  we have n't raised the pigs together , so i can infer the following : * * you * do n't know me * * you * do n't know how knowledgeable i am on this subject * * you * do n't know whether or not i support these laws ( whether it is at the eu level or national level ) * * you * do n't know whether or not i believe they will be effective * et cetera all i 'm asking from you is to put forward some arguments . 
  maybe use the system to change it . 
  but you do n't want to . 
  just like any self respecting idiot , you nonchalantly think destroying the eu is the solution to everything . 
   as an european gun owner , this only made me more anti-eu . 
  you bet i will only vote on anti eu parties and also urge other people to do so in my friend and family circle . 
  found the american spy . 
  all joking aside , you could have at least tried to put forward a few arguments as how to fix the issue of illegal guns coming in ( at least for the schengen area ) . 
  for now you just sound like a retard who has fuck all opinions except for `` i want muh freedom of guns so fuck the eu !!! 1 ! 11 !! 1 ! 1 !!!! 1 ! '' . 
  ( not to mention that the eu is kind of like a democracy , where people can try to influence the parliament they elected or are represented by , and make the parliament abrogate or modify a law , so maybe you could try to convince citizens of the eu to pressure the parliament by argumenting with them . 
  but i guess in totalitarian communist european union , everything is set in stone and nothing will ever change .

  i know what sub you come from to ask that question  since i 've read some of the comments there , and since i know the attitudes of some americans on reddit when it comes to french laws on religion , let me try to thoroughly explain the situation ( some of it by memory ) : * history during the french revolution , people were mostly divided into two main groups : the jacobins and the girondins . 
  the girondins thought that the enemies of france and of the revolution were in foreign countries , so they started to wage wars on foreign monarchies , hoping to export values of the revolution along the way ( which eventually lead to the napoleonic empire ) . 
  the jacobins , however , thought that the enemies of the republic were in france . 
  and they were somewhat right as the strongest opposition to the revolution was from the peasants who were the most influenced by the catholic church , which was strongly in favour of the monarchy . 
  so there was obviously a civil war , and thousands of people got guillotined , or drowned , or went through a firing squad , etc. . . , simply for being too close to the church ( or accused of being so ) . 
  this was known as the terror , and some of its instigators , notoriously maximilien robespierre , ended up being guillotined as well , for being `` tyrants '' . 
  some think that napol\u00e9on could have been guillotined at that time too , but he was in corsica when shit went down for the jacobins after the terror . 
  napol\u00e9on , in 1801 , signed a concordat with the catholic church to put an end to the religion motivated terrorist attacks ( ! ), 
  which was formally abrogated in 1905 . 
  so , since the revolution , religion is associated with monarchy , and with the ancien r\u00e9gime , and monarchy is not really fancied in french culture anymore . 
  therefore there is a strong secular culture , and you can not have a discussion about religion without including atheists and their views and feelings in it . 
  not to mention that non-theistic people represent the dominant group in france ( ~ 67 % of the population ) . 
  * laws ( i posted this [ elsewhere a few of days ago ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/61liw7/donald_trump_printed_out_madeup_300bn_nato/dfg1obf/?context=3 ) ) :  there is no law in france that allows firing someone just for `` wearing religious symbols '' , actually it is illegal to do just that . 
  what you misinterpret is the following :   - religious activities have to be compatible with work days and/or hours , however you can still arrange with your boss taking a day off for a religious holiday before said holiday comes  - religious signs have to be compatible with security measures ; religious signs are not the only things that can be banned for security reasons : necklaces do n't require a jesus cross or a star of david to strangle you if caught in some obstacle ; meaning : you ca n't use your religion to avoid security measures  - employees can not hide their faces if they work in contact with the public : bank , theatre , restaurant , ( private ) hospital , etc. . . ( infringing this may only result in a fine of up to 150 $ )   if someone thinks that they have been unjustly fired , they can still sue the company , and it will up to a court of justice to decide who is in fault . 
  generally speaking , checking for religion compatibility is done before hiring . 
    so no , in france you can not get fired just for that picture of jesus on your desk , or for the scarf on your head . 
  to get fired , you have to use your religion as a way to oppose to the well-functioning of the company ( missing random days , not working at certain hours , disregard for security measures ) . 
    all that said , trying to convert your coworkers to your religion , or threatening to the well-being of your coworkers based on your religion is illegal . 
  to which i 'm gon na add : - some jobs require to have periodical medical visits , and you ca n't use your religion to avoid them . 
  - proselytism , or other religious recruitment , are forbidden in public places . 
  * clothing this seems to be an issue . 
  unlike what some ignorant american said in the thread that motivated you to ask that question , the size of a crucifix is not used to tell whether or not it is considered a religious sign . 
  the size is used to tell whether or not you are allowed to wear it in public : ostentatious signs are forbidden . 
  kippot are not considered ostentatious because , well , there are small and can somewhat appear hidden depending on its colour and the wearer 's hair colour . 
  but a 1 meter diamond encrusted gold crucifix is ostentatious and thus forbidden to be worn in public spaces . 
  same goes for stars of david , muslim crescents , om icons , etc. ... 
  the whole question , which is a ( the ) debate , is : are hijabs , scarfs , or other such clothing religious symbols at all ? 
  should they be banned like that diamond encrusted gold crucifix some seem to fancy ?
