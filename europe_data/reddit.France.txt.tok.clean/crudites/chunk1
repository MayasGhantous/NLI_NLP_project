he did not call you all neonazis , he said that * the neonazis * had a strong , despicable influence . 
  as usual , the foreign press is more obsessed with marine le pen than anyone else . 
  -- jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon now appears as the third candidate in some polls far beyond his colleague beno\u00eet hamon , the only other credible leftist candidate . 
  note that one voter out of three still does not now who to vote for , if they even intend to vote at all . 
  i foresee a bloodshed as only twelve days remain . 
  did he ? 
  do you have a source ? 
  ... or maybe abstention is high because people who voted during the first round for candidates that were n't at the second round did not vote ? 
  let 's say if candidate a gets 40 % at the first round , 30 % candidate b , 20 % candidate c , and 10 % all the other candidates . 
  if voters for candidate c refuse to vote , but all the other voters except for candidate a vote for candidate b , you have an increased abstention ( 20 % , people who voted candidate c ) , and a mobilisation against candidate a , with candidate b at 40 % . 
  so it all depends on each constituency and the ideologies of each candidate . 
   those results are due to the rise of the abstention in some parts of the electorate rather than in the mobilisation of other parts of the electorate . 
  you do n't know . 
   i mean fi disputes the election results all the time . 
  nope , otherwise they would have disputed the results in every constituency they lost . 
  on this particular constituency , valls would have won with a majority of * only * 139 votes , while the other candidate was given ahead up until the last voting stations sent their results . 
  also , there has been irregularities observed according to the candidate , so i think it is reasonable to investigate when the winner depends on less that 150 votes . 
  it is still disputed . 
   the communist party is actually more moderate or open to collaboration than melenchons crew this is still heavily disputed , so let 's not talk about it , alright ? 
  nope . 
  all the media has been saying for two weeks that macron would get an overwhelming majority , and people actually wanted to give macron only a mild majority , according to a poll . 
  we need change some things in the eu, 
  disclaimer : we may redo some elections where irregularities have been observed . 
  nope . 
  [ according to a sociological study ] ( http://www.ipsos.fr/decrypter-societe/2017-06-18-2nd-tour-legislatives-2017-abstention-exceptionnelle-dans-toutes-categories-d-electeurs ) , only a mere 8 % of people who did n't vote today say that they are n't interested in politics at all . 
  actually , numerous candidates from both left and right presented themselves as `` macron-compatible '' , i.e. 
  they would agree with macron 's plateform . 
  when you disagree with macron 's upcoming policies , and you have one of macron 's candidates facing another who is `` macron-compatible '' , you do n't vote at all . 
  actually , there is some controversy on his election . 
  we 'll see tomorrow if the result is confirmed . 
  stuff . 
  i was n't very clear : your response seemed to legitimate what / u/proseedcake originally said about everybody in france skipping class . 
  it is false since [ this very chart ] ( https://www.franceculture.fr/s3/cruiser-production/2017/05/0ae9a1ab-67e6-4c00-a5c0-3b2572ed38a2/738_diplome.jpg ) from your source shows that even amongst the most uneducated , they voted for macron in majority . 
  ... it 's not because people are uneducated that they vote for her ... 
  otherwise , you would see the overwhelming majority of the `` uneducated '' voting for her , except that it 's not the case . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  the part that confuses me most in your original comment is  when are people going to start making proposals like that ? 
  but from what i understand , you were just pointing out that the ccctb was n't all that good ... 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i was asking a question, 
  i do n't understand how everyone is okay with his proposition , whereas when m\u00e9lenchon suggested the same thing , except that he specified how he intended to lead the negociations -- threatening to leave the eu -- he was unanimously hated by this sub . 
  as many of you already said , countries like ireland and luxembourg may very well veto every attempt to get a fairer corporate tax system within the eu . 
  so how exactly macron does intend to negociate ? 
  every single argument that had been put forward against m\u00e9lenchon seems to apply to macron as well . 
  my dearest hope is a pizza . 
  i do n't think so . 
  m\u00e9lenchon does n't really have a good visibility * yet * worldwide , and i 'm sure these articles were initially written in french , then co-signed . 
  if i had some time , i would gladly translate them as i usually do , but right now i 'm very busy with this election thing going on . 
  what were your readings ? 
  i have been reading everything and its opposite in the newspapers lately . 
  [ hundreds of economists ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/elections-presidentielle-legislatives-2017/2017/04/18/pour-une-politique-economique-serieuse-et-a-la-hauteur-des-enjeux-votons-melenchon_1563456 ) and [ academics ] ( https://blogs.mediapart.fr/les-invites-de-mediapart/blog/190417/un-autre-monde-est-possible-avec-jean-luc-melenchon ) are backing his policies , as well as [ 20 ngos ] ( https://blogs.mediapart.fr/georges-ledoux-lanvin/blog/160417/presidentielles-2017-revue-des-etudes-de-20-ong-et-experts-les-avis-sont-unanimes ) . 
  my dearest hope is that m\u00e9lenchon wins . 
  ayy i love you . 
  that 's okay . 
  we still love you . 
  that was n't your choice . 
  i will admit that i was too tired to read your comment in whole , and i only read the last sentence , to which i will answer you : well , i learned something today . 
  ... coupled with harmful european policies allowing easy relocations , and idiots governing the country after the subprime crisis, 
  you would be surprised . 
  it all starts with ideologies . 
  so you think that a good deal with these countries will only screw them over ? 
  i 'm not against having trade deals with canada , i 'm only against the ceta, 
  what do they do to distribute funds fron developed areas in a country to areas that were underdeveloped ? 
  how do areas that were underdeveloped * due to not being a major voter block * compare to areas that are underdeveloped in general ? 
  what percentage ? 
  why does the eu have a say on such funds ? 
  fixing the eu is complicated , as it requires the approval of all members . 
  then people say `` well if you 're not happy with the eu , just leave !, 
  for some reason you get downvoted . 
  we are probably not enough liberal for / r/europe . 
  we are one of the most productive countries in the world , above germany . 
  people are struggling to live with the current minimum wage , $ 1,200 a month . 
  increasing the minimum wage is only a matter of common sense . 
  this will be taken into account by lowering the corporate tax . 
  i do n't believe in the `` high unemployment rates '' argument . 
  whenever someone brings up a new `` restricting '' policy for companies , they throw any of these kind of arguments at us , [ and yet nothing bad happens ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vs3hz.png ) . 
  you do n't know anything about the outcome of such a deal . 
  i know that , even on / r/france things are getting tense , and this is not a reason to downvote me to hell without providing any explanations, 
  yeah sure we will become the next failed communist dictatorship, 
  not at all why , do you think we will be stupid and negociate shitty deals with miserable countries that need us more than we need them ? 
  it is part of his platform . 
  but i do n't really know what else we could do to improve our situation within the eu . 
  yes , thank you . 
  there we are , blaming me for everything and getting ad hominem . 
  have fun . 
  what ? 
  history proves nothing . 
  i look forward to seeing the upcoming events . 
  hmm , that does sound wrong . 
  and even if we turn them into colonies , i doubt it will improve anything . 
  anyway this is not his key measure , and many other candidates have much more controversial propositions . 
  i know right ???? 
  you keep avoiding , or denying my questions on this thread as well , this is getting exhausting . 
  sure , whatever . 
  this is scaring . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  i tried to be informative as well for the people reading . 
  where did i advocate `` economic seppuku '' , and what is wrong with joining a bloc of failed dictatorships ? 
  we already have germany and russia for that . 
  it was relocated to china .
