  where do you read that we will fund anything , and what do you know about the negociations that will be put in place when deciding upon entering the alba ? 
  they want us to join because it would be profitable for them . 
  we will negociate something profitable in return . 
  it 's not like in the eu where we are already in the mud and trying to come out of it . 
   you mean , apart from the whole france stooping to the pathetic level of entering an alliance of barely functioning socialist states ? 
  there . 
  you do n't say what is bad . 
  i want to have deal with questionable countries . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  we do it all the time . 
   it offers basically nothing to france while causing enormous political damage , especially within the political clock of france itself . 
  you basically piss off a lot of countries , a good portion of the french public , also a good portion of latin america , in return for basically nothing . 
  you do n't know what it will offer to france , nor do you know which countries will be pissed , and why . 
  even though some countries are pissed of , why should i care ? 
  and why do you care ? 
  countries piss off other countries all the time . 
  we are the 5th country in the world . 
  we can afford to piss off countries . 
  and for your `` it 's all ideological '' argumentation , i do n't give a shit : you ca n't prove anything . 
  well , there is obviously no point in arguing with you any longer . 
  at least you wo n't be voting in france . 
  have my upvote for my ignorance . 
  he also plans to join the brics . 
  please people , tell me what is wrong instead of downvoting me . 
  you keep beating around the bush , so please tell us : what is wrong with that ? 
   unlike this idea which is good part ideology . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   this is not just trade . 
  yes , you are right . 
  my fault . 
    europe has a strong socialist past  in the west , not in the same manner as latin america , and in east europe , an even worse red past than that of latin america . 
    and with donald trump leading the us today , he could very well declare that we all are failed socialist states and stop trading with us . 
   wtf are you talking about lol ? 
  you argued that we ca n't deal with these countries on the sole basis that they are `` failed socialist states '' . 
  this is outright crazy , and i 'm telling you that someone outright crazy such as donald trump could have very well held the same reasoning as yours to think that `` trading with europe is utterly retarded '' . 
   you believe it is impossible to trade with nations without being in a direct political alliance with them ? 
  the whole point of making an alliance is to simplify actions within the union , and on the long-run mean something economically . 
  we could also negociate everything with every single country in latin america , but we already have a large region ( french guiana ) surrounded by these countries . 
  and what is wrong with joining their alliance , exactly ? 
  so that means they take the threat seriously and we can renegociate the treaties . 
  yay !, 
  you only reworded the title , you did not explain why he 's an utter retard , but i 'll take the bait . 
  firstly , this is probably because they are failed states that they all gathered together to form a union and mean something economically . 
  secondly , french guiana , our region in latin america , pretty much looks like these very same so-called failed states , to the point that [ people have been recently shutting down the region in protest ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/world/europe/french-guiana-general-strike-france.html ) . 
  thirdly , we have nothing to lose by trading with the union , unless of course you have evidence telling otherwise . 
  finally , we already are trading with many questionable and undemocratic countries such as russia and china , but for some reason that 's okay with them . 
  fair enough . 
  we have golf courses . 
  am i missing something ? 
  what happened on / r/europe so that everyone hates him, 
  please , explain why the title proves that he 's an utter retard . 
  what about france signing awful deals with north american countries , or importing oil and goods from questionable countries , such as china , india , or even russia ? 
  i do n't get the logic of refusing to trade with countries on the basis that they are `` failed socialist states '' . 
  europe has a strong socialist past , and with donald trump leading the us today , he could very well declare that we all are failed socialist states and stop trading with us . 
  then we wo n't trade anything and nothing bad comes out of the deal . 
  your figure is almost 10 years old , and may be strongly correlated to the aftermath of the financial crisis . 
  it was close to [ 2bn euros ] ( http://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/le-budget-des-outre-mer-maintenu-plus-de-2-milliards-d-euros-pour-2017-401549.html ) in 2016 , which represents roughly $ 740 per capita ( 2.7 million people ) , compared to [ nearly 400bn euros ] ( http://www.performance-publique.budget.gouv.fr/sites/performance_publique/files/files/documents/ressources_documentaires/documentation_budgetaire/chiffres_cles/depliant_budget2016.pdf ) in total for everyone else ( 63 million people ) the same year , which represents $ 6300 per capita . 
  they are treated like shit . 
  i do n't exactly understand why am i getting downvoted . 
  please , do elaborate , people . 
  mmh , you 're probably right . 
  have my upvote . 
  :p this is why you and i should do some research on the numbers . 
  so that we can decide whether we should be even more worried or not . 
  i would n't say for the amount of crime they 've gotten away with , but yeah . 
  why not the us as well . 
  ~ ~ it 's not like they will stop trading with us first anyway with the donald in place ~ ~, 
  he is * formally * right , though . 
  we paid tribute to the dead for the last terrorist attacks , yet none of these people were our idols . 
  the celac is mentioned . 
  [ i posted a full translation of the article ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/654cii/french_presidential_candidate_m%c3%a9lenchon_wants/dg7k7a3/ ), 
  there 's an elephant in the room and no one seem to care to point it out . 
  what is wrong with what he suggests ? 
  they both have very similar ideas though . 
  saying `` further to the left '' does n't really make any sense anymore, 
  well not really , it 's a breakthrough in french politics . 
  i do n't exactly understand why your comment is controversial . 
  you throw that like not only it was a bad thing , but also like he wants to put a dictatorship in place . 
  calm down , he only wants to trade with other countries . 
  or maybe we should stop trading with india or china for example , that are n't all good either . 
  care to elaborate , on the case of m\u00e9lenchon ? 
  care to elaborate ? 
  you 're right , let 's pay even less people . 
  how much would it cost ? 
  he is , contrary to popular belief . 
  please explain . 
  so it 's either we 're having really bad luck , or something wrong has been going on for decades without us noticing . 
  i smell irony but i ca n't quite tell if i 'm right or not . 
  where exactly is it worrying ? 
  this is stupid . 
  wanting to trade with your neighbor does not mean you want to look like them . 
  or we would 've all been working like germany or the united states for a long time . 
  at least trading with these countries will be easier . 
  i do n't see where it is a bad thing . 
  source ? 
  let me translate all that for you .
