  yes that ( and further interest rate cuts ) was the plan , even mentionned in the summit release , and it will be done * if * the deal passes , after a few months restoring basic function in the greek economy , passing reforms , etc. 
  nothing wrong with saying it earlier and vetoing a deal , or later to force deeper restructurimg or other measures , but the timing is very precisely chosen so the impact of the leak can only de destructive . 
  but again this is not an official statement , so it is some power play but by whom , hard to say . 
   they added language in the 2nd bailout stating that the eurogroup would take a haircut in the event that greece does n't have self-sustainable debt by 2012 . 
  do you have a reference ? 
  i do n't recall ever seeing this . 
  ( restructuring is of course a different matter ) . 
  perhaps but greece adamantly did not want it from europe . 
  in the present case it means extended default and complete uncertainty . 
  the imf does n't send tanks if a country does n't pay , it justs stops sending any new money and suspends some rights . 
  this may indeed be a manoeuvre directed against her and having little to do with greece . 
  it might have more to do with the fact that she is standing for a new mandate and some might want to saddle her with a collapse in greece to avoid that . 
  other than that opinions differ on lagarde , certainly not everyone shares your view . 
  edit : the guardian says ~ ~ the report is signed by ~ ~ zhu min , deputy managing director * said the same thing in an interview today * . 
  is he a candidate to succeed lagarde ? 
  no that 's not it . 
  i fully expected they would come out with something like this later on , after the basic deal is in place and as part of the `` possible restructuring '' promised . 
  but doing it now only risks killing the deal , it can not change it . 
  not even waiting for the bridge loan to be in means they are pushing for default . 
  there are some deep politics here - lagarde was apparently in favor of the deal and here she is being undercut . 
  this is the second time an imf sustainibility report is leaked at a politically sensitive time , and this is no accident . 
  may be sign of a power struggle within the fund . 
  and the eurozone has the same rule - only ez 's rule is written in treaties while if i 'm not mistaken the imf one is only de facto . 
  but this is not pushing anyone to `` behave '' , there is zero chance that eu will suddenly say `` we were just joking , here 's your haircut '' . 
  washington may well be behind this ( they issued a distinctly unenthusiastic statement after the summit ) but why do they want grexit ( and , at this point , default ) then ? 
  it is strange , by releasing this now it looks like they are trying to undermine the deal and push for grexit instead . 
  basically their message is `` this deal can not work '' . 
  or maybe they just want to eschew any responsibility later if it is passed and does n't work . 
  this would have led to de facto grexit , immediate removal of ela , default by greece , and probably a lot more . 
  seizing control of the central bank in particular would have been a breach of such magnitude it is difficult to imagine all the consequences . 
  a well prepared and negociated grexit is a debatable proposition with pros and cons , but this plan was sheer lunacy . 
   in a federal union the greeks would actually have a say in what politicians are making those decisions yes , they would have a 2 % share of the vote . 
  they do n't have to `` prove '' it , only to `` conclude '' that it is required , and not that it would have real and grave consequences , but that there is a threat . 
  they will do it if necessary . 
   by way of derogation from paragraph 3 , an emergency voting procedure shall be used where ** the commission and the ecb both conclude ** that a failure to urgently adopt a decision to grant or implement financial assistance , as defined in articles 13 to 18 , ** would threaten the economic and financial sustainability of the euro area ** . 
  in france , parliament will vote on wednesday . 
  it will pass easily , probably with a very broad majority ( assuming the greek parliament passes it ) . 
  why did they have to make the wording so harsh ? 
  the introductory paragraph is so undiplomatic it can only make it harder for tsipras to gain durable support for it . 
  regardless of the contents of the agreement , it is really sad that they could n't manage to present it as an honorable compromise , but found it necessary instead to single out greece as the untrusted party right at the top . 
  we 're in this together , whatever the past faults of any party . 
  actually in this case it is , the 2012 sovereign bond default by greece was widely reported then as the biggest in history and ( fortunately ) there has not been a bigger one since . 
  not really , just part of the overall delay then stop of a lot of the program i suppose . 
  bear in mind it was not meant as additional spending but ( as i understand it ) as a replacement for other complicated systems as a way to make welfare better targeted , less costly , more effective etc. 
  so implementing it meant at the same time cutting something else . 
  it was in the second program but implementation has been delayed . 
  www.efsf.europa.eu/attachments/ocp192_en.pdf , p. 6  the programme has a strong focus on social welfare and reducing unemployment . 
  ( ... ) a minimum income guarantee scheme is being launched on a pilot basis in two municipalities . 
  it is intended that this scheme will be rolled-out across the country in phased manner , starting in 2015 . 
  it will be a key component of the country 's new strategy for social welfare ( ... ), 
  i suspect it has cost far more than that . 
  according to some reports the banks may need as much as 16 bn to be recapitalized , and capital controls have a huge cost but can not be lifted until confidence returns in both the banks and his commitment to reform . 
  both need to be done urgenly . 
  it is a very tight line for all , but not impossible ( hopefully ) . 
  they must throw him a lifeline today or tomorrow but this is only the first step . 
  yes . 
  this does n't mean they could n't do it , but they 'd have to show their project and get a non objection . 
  this was unavoidable , otherwise they would have taken measures that in their view were positive , but would move away from the stated objectives . 
  to be fair , simplifying the tax code would have been a minefield , as such measures would easily involve very debatable impacts ( e.g. 
  replace two rates with a single one : ok it simplifies but what is the effect on revenue ? 
  etc. ), 
  but many other measures were clearly open , either because they were already part of prior commitments long delayed , or because their effect was clear and in the right direction . 
  in any case they did not respect this and went ahead with unilateral measures clearly going against those conditions , for instance : http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f3b674d8-f3d8-11e4-99de-00144feab7de.html had they instead moved ahead on privatization for instance , or on reducing red tape , or hiring tax inspectors , etc. 
  no one would have objected - on the contrary it would have raised their credibility - and no one objected either when they did a deal with switwerland over accounts there . 
   eurogroup statement on greece 20/02/2015 . 
  the greek authorities ( ... ) commit to implementing long overdue reforms to tackle corruption and tax evasion , and improving the efficiency of the public sector . 
  in this context , the greek authorities undertake to make best use of the continued provision of technical assistance . 
  ( ... ) in light of these commitments , we welcome that in a number of areas the greek policy priorities can contribute to a strengthening and better implementation of the current arrangement . 
  ** the greek authorities commit to refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets , economic recovery or financial stability , as assessed by the institutions . 
  and catalans should be allowed to do so . 
  keeping a region within a country against its wishes is not justified . 
  of course such a referendum need not lead to independence - it did n't for quebec nor for scotland . 
  but it should be allowed . 
  yes . 
  even without compensation . 
  a settlement where russia would withdraw from and stop interfering in eastern ukraine and instead actually help dismantle the rebel thing , some autonomy would be granted to that region at the same time ensuring it is peacefully reintegrated into ukraine , and an autodetermination referendum by the population of crimea , could form the basis of a solution . 
  if crimeans want to join russia that is their right , the illegal annexation does not change that . 
  but this would require strong security assurances from russia , and that it drops its objections to closer ties between ukraine and the eu , including possibly joining it - while nato would need to commit to not getting involved in ukraine . 
  un peacekeeping troops could play a role too . 
  in the real world , ukraine would gain far more from such a settlement than from becoming the theater of a proxy war between russia and nato - of course russia 's actions were blatantly illegal , but what other realistic * solution * is there ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  two things : first 28 replaces what rate ? 
  i.thought it was 26 already ? 
  second , usually corporate tax means tax on the final profit , after all costs and amortization and salaries are paid . 
  while it 's high ( well if france it 's 33 ) and a rise is n't good , i do n't get how it can have such a huge impact as killing a business . 
  they are not meant to punish , i do n't like tax rises much and prefer spending cuts , but the books must be balanced - this is not an option , it is a constraint everyone faces . 
  and such balancing is a requisite of every program in every country . 
  imf etc gets in because the books are unbalanced , getting this straightened is the starting point of any discussion . 
  the tax rates in greece ( even the newer ones ) are high but less so than in many other countries so it 's not that bad . 
  sell more state assets , reduce pensions and other spending and you 'll have less taxes - i would do that but i m not in charge . 
  to be honest i do n't like those rises , better a low rate on a large base than the contrary , but it 's easy to criticize - as it is it those rates are not unusual at all and do not seem punitive , but maybe they can lower them later . 
  i.wanted to ask.you about it jobs : romania is an it hub , they have tons of jobs in that field and are an outsourcing center for other countries - what makes greece less attractive for setting up such it centers ? 
  ( well , after things settle a bit and the capital control and bank thing is resolved ), 
  well , we saw today at least one more bidder interested in the ports - that 's a big investor . 
  but small businesses are important , are taxes so high ? 
  corporate tax is on profits , so yes it is bad but it does not strangulate a small business ? 
  but to promote high tech you do not need more regulations , you need * less * . 
  i do n't know what the barriers are today ( actually i read that before syriza thrashed the place there was a boom in startup companies , if so this could easily restart once the uncertainty is over ) . 
  one big issue is the banking system and capital controls - they need to resolve that very quickly , the absence of a working financial system is crippling and will delay any restart . 
  the banks most likely need recapitalization , some may need resolution , the faster the better .
