  which one would apply here ? 
  it is , more than a bit . 
  the question is whether to accept or refuse the blackmail . 
   greece is talking to anyone that might lend them money good one : ), 
  they will just infringe the treaties , that 's all - there are no real sanctions for that . 
  great idea , two years later you have protests all over greece against those evil american capitalists who are exploiting greece and paying almost no tax , then they get thrown out . 
  this is greece 's choice however . 
  it would be a good option but syriza seems to want to avoid it . 
  humanitarian aid is probably a more immediate concern than an agreement that would not be abided by . 
  it can not be legally binding since the question asked means , strictly speaking , nothing as it is about a proposal both expired and inapplicable now . 
  but politically the result shapes what follows . 
  i ca n't imagine them raising ela after a no - the best they can do is keep it unchanged , which is already a huge stretch of their rules . 
  parliaments will probably ( ? ), 
  not approve a deal that is rejected by a wide majority . 
  oh well , who knows . 
  if this could be done without acrimony this would probably be best in case of no . 
  but i fear this will be another drama full of accusations , and will leave bitter divisions within greece and within europe . 
  with a no they wo n't let it drop but they ca n't prevent a default . 
  it 's going to be long negociations , they ca n't just give the money to syriza for it to spend in a desperate attempt to shore up the economy only to crash a few months later . 
  also they now need to protect the eurozone from contagion . 
  syriza-like demands elsewhere would bankrupt the eurozone and spell its end , and as much as they want to help greece they can not sacrifice the ez . 
  syriza may now impose terrible hardship on the greek population and portray the ez as the culprit , if only because ecb must cut ela due to lack of credible perspective of agreement - it is a very difficult period ahead for all ( should no be confirmed ) . 
  ah yes , i was looking only at their referendum forecast but actually they have 60 % for both  we think that there is a 10-20 % chance of the first scenario , a 20-30 % chance of the second that greece votes for a deal with europe against the government 's advice , and ** a 60 % chance of the third scenario of an outright `` no '' vote ** . 
  the consequences of either the second or third scenario would be severe . 
  either one would trigger serious political instability , likely default , and a sharply increased prospect of an exit from the euro zone . 
  ** we have revised up our estimate of the likelihood of a `` grexit '' to 60 % ** , from 40 % previously . 
  edit : but ** this article is from june 29th ** . 
  zh was referring to the fact that they just reiterated their 60 % estimate wrt referendum result . 
  yep , estimate is about 75 % chance of a no at the moment . 
  https://www.betfair.com/exchange/#/politics/event/27478353/market?marketid=1.119315327 the same was predicting 65 % chance of yes yesterday , but obviously it becomes more reliable as time passes . 
  edit : now 98 % prob of no . 
  60 % chance of a no vote winning actually , not of grexit . 
  good point . 
  still , once the funds are declared , they become a pie for the government . 
  the risk of seeing a large tax imposed afterwards ( as part as a `` make the rich pay '' scheme ) is high when dealing with a government which is both far left and bankrupt . 
  amnesty is about penalties for the past , it gives no assurances for what comes next . 
  sounds good but ( assuming `` no '' wins as now seems likely ) even with amnesty the funds are n't going to be repatriated to a bankrupt country , where they would expect to be promptly hit by new taxes or haircuts / forced conversion into a quickly devaluing currency . 
  more likely they will move to other jurisdictions if they can ( though many must have done so already , given the measures switzerland has already adopted ) . 
  depends a lot on today 's result . 
  edit : in light of the very likely no result , the primary focus should be on protecting the rest of the eurozone from the fallout . 
  this is not about economic consequences but political ones . 
  we face a time of bitterness and division , populism is strengthened with a real danger of severe disputes heating up . 
  yes . 
  hollande is doing a little bit of reform together with rising debt and clientele spending , he is criticized for `` austerity '' and `` spending cuts '' which actually mean increasing spending a little less than some forecast and running a deficit of `` only '' 4 % of gdp - and we have a risk of getting our own populists in power with marine le pen . 
  the situation is far less critical of course , so far - and it is still possible to correct it . 
  the quote is from [ wikipedia article on uk debt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_national_debt ) , what the source of that is i do n't know . 
  it 's always complicated , but the uk government at the time was overspending , ended up needing an imf rescue and got its house in order later when a responsible leader willing to make tough choices was elected . 
  like many others though , since 2008 it went for a dramatic increase in debt , which is not a good situation . 
  indeed . 
   in 1976 the british government led by james callaghan faced a sterling crisis during which the value of the pound tumbled and the government found it difficult to raise sufficient funds to maintain its spending commitments . 
  the prime minister was forced to apply to the international monetary fund for a # 2.3 billion rescue package ; the largest-ever call on imf resources up to that point . 
  [ 8 ] in november 1976 the imf announced its conditions for a loan , including deep cuts in public expenditure , in effect taking control of uk domestic policy . 
  [ 9 ] the crisis was seen as a national humiliation , with callaghan being forced to go `` cap in hand '' to the imf . 
   my impression is that the gov is picking up boats and redirecting them to papua or nauru , then granting asylum from there and selling this as `` no boats arrive in australia . '', 
  that is an interesting twist , i did n't know that . 
  it would certainly give perspective to the idea of asylum seekers being deterred . 
  so they allow people to apply for asylum from abroad ? 
  in europe it 's usually a requirement to be in the country . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  if only the uk could also join the euro to help us ward off those trying to foist fiscal union upon us !, 
  but these figures are until 2012 which is when the current restrictive policy was put in place afaik i do n't know the australian policy well but i recall seeing those numbers and arrivals by boat did drop significantly following that . 
  i must say your choice of figures in this perspective seems disingenuous . 
  maybe the current policy does n't work but 2012 figures say nothing about that . 
  i do n't understand what those `` 100s '' you quote are referring to , but this has nothing whatsoever to do with the number of refugees or asylum seekers . 
  just to take one number at random ,  so far this year [ november 2014 ] , nearly 37,000 eritreans have sought refuge in europe http://www.unhcr.org/546606286.html ( note : refugees from eritrea are normally granted asylum when they apply , for obvious reasons ) global statistic for 2014 ( http://www.unhcr.org/551128679.html ) : europe received 714.000 claims . 
  indeed it 's not 100.000 per year , it will probably be 1.000.000 in 2015 . 
  ridiculoulsy small indeed . 
  the numbers granted by australia are indeed extremely low , they make sure no one applies so the rate is high , but europe receives and accepts orders of magnitude more refugees than australia . 
  he is . 
  i ca n't stand listening to him more than 10 seconds any more though . 
  he is so smart and everyone else is either criminal , terrorist , or just plain stupid no to see the obvious truth of what he is saying . 
  yes the creditors have a secret deal all ready to be signed by all parliaments if only the voters say no . 
  and the banks will open on monday too . 
  and they 'll get money from santa . 
  yeah i saw it , do n't agree with it . 
  spanish paper , and he must have checked the wording . 
  he says ` this has a name : terrorism ' , the interviewer asks ` do you really mean that ? ', 
  and he says yes and elaborates - of course he does not mean bombs but clearly chose to use this word . 
  he is fluent in english so the potential impact of this word was known to him even he he speaks no spanish . 
  and i doubt the interview was done in greek , but i do n't know . 
  agree with several things you wrote but not this - greece definitely needs a committed and responsible government with the drive to take tough measures and restart the economy , with discipline but * not * some obedient puppet . 
  ( and please no fiscal union talk , i 'll turn anti-euro if i keep hearing that ) i was for a while stupidly expecting tsipras to become responsible , but that was a delusion , he is just a student protest leader who ran a wave of discontent and has sabotaged the prospects of his country . 
  varoufakis had written about his crazy arrogant strategy before so despite his charm and intellectual credit he was a danger from day one in his position . 
  `` greek citizens are so lazy '' on the other hand is neither invaluable nor well thought out . 
  i am not saying macedonia is unsafe , i have no idea at all , but those classifications are silly . 
  tourists die in road accidents or from a heart attack like everyone else , not in hebdo or other terror attacks which kill or injure on average just a few ppl per year in france , and do not target tourists ( they do in egypt or tunisia for obvious reasons that do not apply in europe ) . 
  uk , france , and spain are high risk . 
  and the fco os high on something else . 
  the samaras government never bit the bullet , it haggled on reforms , delayed , implemented half heartedly , opened an early retirement budget hole for its successor , and put up taxes instead to reach numerical targets without improving tax collection - the lenders were also responsible for letting that happen but they were not in charge . 
  this may sound uncouth but what delayed the recovery was that lack of commitment to reform and spending cuts from the government , not austerity . 
  bear in mind the austerity imposed by lenders still meant bringing additional money in on a net basis . 
  tried very very roughly , counting heads in a small area and extrapolating : got about 20,000 on the pic ? 
  could be much more - but it does n't look like100 ,000 . 
  what is the surface area of that square ? 
  edit : looking again , fisheye distortion is really bad , would n't bet on any figure . 
  the collective far right ? 
  please . 
  yes the vast majority of europeans want nothing to do with the policies defended by these protesters . 
  he 's still leader of his party though , what exactly has changed in the status of his declarations since 1994 ? 
  i understand he is thought to have ties with the kremlin , but has this changed/become stronger recently ?
