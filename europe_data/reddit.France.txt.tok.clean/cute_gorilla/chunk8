  not sure that all these funds are that useful but still a lot of investment money going in . 
  the ukrainian government is becoming more and more of an embarrassment . 
  well that 's true , though i would still expect the uk to maintain a friendlier climate so that this exodus would not be massive , as well as to slow down the adoption of some policies , and benefit from some transfer of business from frankfurt . 
  anyway , the uk joining the ez is n't going to happen anytime soon , so this wo n't be tested , 
  first i do n't know if we disagree about abortion - in any case i do not object to it in any way . 
  the class argument is n't really relevant - whatever we are discussing , rich people have more options , that 's the point of being rich after all . 
  the point you make about dysfunctional families however , i.e. 
  that keeping an unwanted child has external social costs , and that it may be cheaper to fund an abortion , is a good one . 
  this kind of question needs research to evaluate the actual impact of modifying the amount of the bill taxpayers pick up - i doubt 100 % is optimal but it may well be that some fairly high level produces more desirable outcomes to an extent which justifies their cost . 
  this would be a good idea . 
  two central banks , one conservative ( not the current ecb ) hard money one , and one inflationary busily propping up government debts . 
  both currencies should be legal tender across the ez , with freedom to contract in either one . 
  the city would be fine in or out of the eurozone . 
  frankfurt is no match to london , and what business it gets from being the biggest financial center in the ez would move to london . 
  as to hk/singapore , some might notice they 're not in europe . 
  what a siugwo !, 
  ( * ) ( \\* ) ** si ** lly ** ug ** ly ** wo ** rd , just a new trend i 'm starting , 
   syriza had no issues bailing a northern greece football team and its owner . 
  when did they do that ? 
  i do n't know . 
  yes you can consider a pregnancy as a parasitosis and abortion as a cure for that , but while technically this is correct i do not see it this way , and and do n't think such a view must be imposed on all . 
  as to the purpose of compulsory insurance it can be many different things ( and it can take many different forms ) , and having it ( as well as deciding what it must cover ) is just a political choice , not a moral obligation in any way . 
  also , again , what distinguishes voluntary abortion from all the other examples you quote is that it is not a medical procedure designed to restore or protect health or to prevent disease - medical abortion on such grounds exists of course but this is not what we are talking about . 
  what , the danes are closing in on us ? 
  i 'm very partial to goat cheese too - will never leave a cheese shop without some , and it 's always the first one i pick , 
  halloumi.sounds great , is it exported ? 
  i do n't recall ever seeing it in france . 
  it depends . 
  supermarket brie can be very average , as can any cheese that has n't been properly cared for ( especially this kind of cheese , it must be matured properly otherwise it 's useless ) . 
  but real brie ( brie de meaux and brie de melun are the ones most easily found ) is tasty and subtle , better than camembert as a rule ( though this is a personnal taste , and camembert is * very * variable ) . 
  do you have cheese shops in berlin ? 
  if so do try it , it 's nothing like plastic . 
  this is true of many types of cheese , there is a world of difference between artisanal cheese selected and matured by an expert * fromager affineur * and those you can buy in a supermarket . 
  some kinds are much less delicate - roquefort , cantal , comte , tomme de savoie or brebis des pyrenees for instance can stand travel and are not too sensitive after maturation , so they would be better bets than brie if not buying from a specialist shop . 
  saint-nectaire ( and also reblochon ) for some reason , while the ` soft kind ' similar to brie , can be pretty good too even if it has been treated a bit harshly , but they must still reach the shelves at just the right degree of maturation and be consumed not too long after that , otherwise they can be rather disappointing . 
  not really specific to finance , it 's just that financial contracts can have a lot of leverage and can be tough to understand . 
  while the person signing the contract has a duty to know what they 're doing , someone coming in later ( supervisor , accountant , auditor , whatever ) can struggle to unwind the logic of the deal and understand its risks . 
  there is also a whiff of sorcery around it where people tend to accept ( wrongly of course ) that it 's not for mere mortals to understand so they just assume the guy who did it knew what he was doing . 
  and of course taking advice from the bank selling you the stuff is about as smart as asking a drug dealer if his heroin is safe . 
  that was n't clear from your post . 
  `` please provide a translation '' is not the same as `` i would like to ask you to not post or upvote non-english content '' . 
  but then if the former is what you meant i agree . 
  it is all a matter of what the compulsory insurance covers . 
  voluntary abortion is not a health issue , so whether it is covered is a political choice . 
  voluntary insurance can cover things not included in the compulsory scheme . 
  one detail is that the way they implement the brrd has been criticized by the ecb , notably for excessive political involvement in the decisions . 
  they may need to revisit it later . 
  fine , do it on credit then ( or through voluntary insurance , or any other voluntary means ) . 
  also by asking someone to pay for what they buy , no one is `` violating their reproductive rights '' , whatever that means . 
  they 're not really gambling against the bank itself , who will hedge its exposure , but it 's the same yes - but when your boss or your voters tell you `` you must reduce the interest cost , just find a way '' , a 90 % chance can look good . 
  it is easy to convince onself that a small chance of loss is really timy and ignore it . 
  plus your loss is generally limited - the company or city may lose a huge amount , but it 's not your money ( and if it does happen you can always blame the bankers and explain you did not understand the intricacies of these sophisticated derivatives , were misled etc. ) . 
  looking at the risk/reward ratio of the individual making the decision , it can be quite good . 
  the explanation of the general principles involved is really excellent in this article . 
   this trade is magic , but its broad outline is recognizable . 
  the customer wants to pay a lower interest rate than it 's currently paying . 
  ( who would n't ? ), 
  the bank is happy to make its interest expense lower now , in exchange for making it higher later on . 
  ( the bank is obviously not going to make it lower now and also lower later on , that is dumb . ), 
  the customer is n't so sure about that : paying less now and paying more later does n't seem like that great a deal . 
   so the bank offers an even better deal : pay less now , and maybe pay more later . 
  obviously , maybe paying more later is worth less than definitely paying more later , so you 'll have to pay more more later . 
  there 's a series of dials to turn : the more money you save now , the longer you save for , and the less likely you are to pay more later , the bigger the amount of money you 'll end up owing if the trade moves against you . 
  the bank knows exactly how those dials work , and the math is no doubt hard , but anyone can figure out the gist : the lower the probability that you have to write the bank a check , the bigger that check has to be . 
  that 's all a corporate ( or municipality ) treasurer must know before signing . 
  some chose to ignore it ... or rather , gamble that it will work out . 
  i tend to agree with you up to a point - posting untranslated non-english articles essentially restricts discussion to those who speak that language ( and if that 's the goal , country specific subreddits would be a better place ) or headline based discussion . 
  but if a reasonable translation is provided , this is not an issue and instead it introduces a source most would not have found otherwise . 
  to me , untranslated non-english is just annoying , but those with translation are a valuable addition . 
  it does , yes - my issue is more with assigning that culpability to a religion as a whole , rather than to the groups involved ( or to broader groups that support or enable them , including religious authorities , which can very well be complicit ) . 
  fair point but all of these are about restoring or preserving health . 
  some abortions are of course prescribed for health reasons and they fall into this category - of course they should be handled the same as to who is bearing the cost . 
  but voluntary abortions , by definition , are not about health preservation . 
  of course no one should interfere with that choice , this is not the issue , this is about whether the cost must be borne by someone else . 
  voters and their representatives can of course decide one way or the other , but there is nothing wrong with denying it . 
  i do n't know , but it is not uncommon here - recently they bowed to pressure from taxi drivers protests when they were burning cars too . 
  one issue is that while such protests have become less and less popular over recent years , they still tend to be viewed as `` legitimate struggles '' by a significant part of the population so the government must tread carefully . 
  fighting them head on and showing footage of clashes etc would risk makimg them look like victims , and the government is rather weak politically today ( its majority includes a rowdy left wing very much attuned to `` social struggles '' ) so this counts too . 
  and of course they do their best to avoid weeks of disruption , and giving something can be the best way . 
  to be fair they are not really `` giving '' 600m $ , most of that ( i think ) is loans . 
  one more thing : in france , the state plays a huge role and intervenes in most everything in many ways , and expecting it to solve every problem is a rather widespread attitude . 
  the farmers are actually asking for higher prices more than anything else , they want the government to manipulate the market through regulation or do whatever it can to increase prices . 
  well abortion is not a cure for a disease . 
  eating is far more crucial to human health than any medical procedure yet we do not fund it . 
  so no , calling abortion a `` reproductive issue '' and including it in a broad category is not a justification . 
  now i am not pursuing this exchange , you have brilliantly exposed my major bias and disregard for the health of millions , so this would be pointless . 
  i agree . 
  sorry nothing to add , but thanks for the kind words  about culture yes i was using the term in the sense of the set of values , attitudes , etc. 
  shared by a group , not necessarily a region ( or religion ) . 
  i agree , being `` mainstream '' does n't make something good ... 
  i guess it is true of today 's mainstream religions , and as you point out a destructive form can become widespread . 
  the influence of radical islam today is not restricted to a small crew of raving lunatics , in some form or other it is even the dominant official form in some countries . 
  one point i do n't quite agree on - i do n't think it is meaningful to ascribe the high moral ground to one religion or other according to how close its values are to modern liberal ones ( or according to other criteria for that matter ) . 
  there is i think something objectively wrong about preaching hate , in any day and age , and whether from a religious or political stand - and a religion where this becomes widespread needs to do some soul searching - but the role of women , attitudes towards sexuality etc are more complex . 
  price for meat fell so they loose money ( it 's cattle farmers protesting this time ) . 
  they protest , so the state gives them money . 
  they want more , so they protest more . 
  the pm also called for higher prices ( how this is supposed to happen is unclear , but he said prices must rise , so maybe the markets will listen to him ) . 
  indeed . 
  huh ?
