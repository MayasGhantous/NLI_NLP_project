  * better make a self post for this , and to provide explanation . 
  exemple : nai\u00dfance u +00 df latin small letter sharp s utf-8 : c3 9f utf-16be : 00df decimal : & # 223 ; \u00df category : ll ( letter , lowercase ) bidi : l ( left-to-right ), 
  * accents are needed in french , as they have spelling , grammatical , and conjugation functions . 
  * - jaur\u00e8s assassine \u2260 jaur\u00e8s assassin\u00e9 : * jaur\u00e8s kills \u2260 jaur\u00e8s is killed * - un interne tue \u2260 un interne tu\u00e9 \u2260 un intern\u00e9 tue \u2260 un intern\u00e9 tu\u00e9 : * an interne kills \u2260 an interne is killed \u2260 an internee kills \u2260 an internee is killed * - les avocats seront juges \u2260 les avocats seront jug\u00e9s : * lawyers will judge \u2260 lawyers will be judged * - j\u2019ai un enfant l\u00e9gitime et un enfant l\u00e9gitim\u00e9 : * i have a legitimate child and child who became legitimate * - jolie demoiselle , 18 ans , cherche mec m\u00eame \u00e2ge \u2260 jolie demoiselle , 18 ans , cherche mec m\u00eame \u00e2g\u00e9 : * pretty mademoiselle , 18 years old , is looking for a guy same age \u2260 pretty mademoiselle , 18 years old , is looking for a guy even old * etc , etc. 
  * an important point to remember is the fact that the r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise is [ la\u00efc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la%c3%afcit%c3%a9 ) , the state can not be directly involved in religious matters . 
  this is why it is not possible to directly form or fund the priests . 
  quality partnerships with representatives of cults -- french and foreign -- are therefore important , because otherwise we get imams from saudi arabia or else who come to preach ideas legally incompatible with the values of the r\u00e9publique .

   in germany we do n't use accents uh ?

  thank you for your submission !, 
  unfortunately , it has been removed . 
  * i delisted this submission because the article 's title has been editorialised . 
  to editorialise titles is bad . 
  i invite you to resubmit this link with using the original title . 
  * * to expand a title for precising it is ok ( `` blabla -- a short text '' ) . 
  disambiguations are also ok ; for example replacing `` he did that '' by `` [ mr something ] did that '' . 
  * editorialisation for putting bad emphasis on refugees and muslim . 
  also a pretext for hate speech .
