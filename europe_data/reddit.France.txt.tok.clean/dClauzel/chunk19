  change your media . 
  monaco ne s ' inqui\u00e8te pas , en revanche * however , monaco is not worried *, 
   but if you see how people just keep on bitching about it , day after day , it makes you wonder what their real motivations are .

  hurray for paranoid nationalism ... *, 
   we 've known for some time now that hearing negative news broadcasts can have an immediate effect on your stress level , but new research we just conducted in partnership with arianna huffington shows how significant these negative effects can be on our workdays . 
  just a few minutes spent consuming negative news in the morning can affect the entire emotional trajectory of your day . 
  * haters gon na hate ... and be depressed given their submissions , certain people on this subreddit should quickly make an appointment with their doctor . 
  * one possibility is to be more aggressive for removing submissions on the same subject ; for example there is no point in having an article from the bbc , the guardian , and politico , where they would be essentially saying the same thing without bringing new information or new perspective . 
  but it 'll make people bitching because we would `` dare '' to touch `` their '' submission that would necessarily be better and more relevant than others ( ah , the karmawhores ... ) * * the line is fine between technical moderation and curation .
