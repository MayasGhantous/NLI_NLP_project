  we seldom see japanese and chinese people on forums , because they have huge communities that suffice them enough .

  * nice datavis work \u2764 we need more people working to understand our community . 
  * for historical reasons ( minitel , isp 's platforms , etc. ), 
  the francophones had very early some major forums for thematic discussions . 
  after several decades , so they have now huge communities , and a large treasure of interesting discussions with many people involved . 
  * * therefore reddit presents relatively little interest , except for getting closer to international communities . 
  and yet , when we look francophones subreddits we realise they have little links with others . 
  it was easy to see , and recent . 
  very honestly , it is surprising that you did n't found it yourself ...
