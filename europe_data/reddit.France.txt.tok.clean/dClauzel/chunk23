  the so-called `` local shadowbans '' used by subreddits and handled by automod are properly named `` botbans '' . 
  they are completely different from the `` shadowbans '' which are only managed by admins . 
  ask the admins , only them have the capacity to apply shadowbans . 
  we have no information or control over this .

  user was shadowbanned for this post, 
   the french marquise de cr\u00e9quy wrote in her book `` souvenirs '' , that the tune grand dieu sauve le roi , was written by jean-baptiste lully in gratitude for the survival by louis xiv of an anal fistula operation . 
  the surgical knife that was purpose built for the occasion is at display in the mus\u00e9e d'histoire de la m\u00e9decine . 
  lully set words by marie de brinon to music , and cr\u00e9quy claims the tune was later plagiarised by handel . 
  translated in latin under the name domine , salvum fac regem , it became the french anthem until 1792 . 
  after the battle of culloden , the hanover dynasty supposedly then adopted this melody as the british anthem . 
  everytime an english sing god save the queen , he wishes a good health to the late king of france louis xiv,
