  one thing to keep in mind is that the test is strict ` https://example.com/bonjour.html`and ` https://example.com/bonjour.html?somerandomparameters` are seen ( correctly ) as different address , but in practice they both point to the same article . 
  this is the main source of misdetection . 
  another thing is that we have no information or control on this filter ; it is only handled by reddit . 
  bottom line : we are stuck we to tool we have , and ** we need reports from the community for doing manual clean up ** . 
  our scripts help us a lot for working with problematic submissions and posters , but we still relay a lot on the community . 
  please pm immediately the moderation team when you see this , so we can act quickly . 
  we have all different works and schedules , and are not paid by reddit , so sometimes we can be slow to react . 
  we * really * need the help from the community to bring down propaganda and spamming .
