   the photography expert patricia holland wrote about this in the 1990s . 
  she said the focus on kids in disaster or war zones was , weirdly , about making westerners feel good : ` as the children in the image reveal their vulnerability , we long to protect them and provide for their needs . 
  paradoxically , while we are moved by the image of the sorrowful child , we also welcome it , for it can arouse pleasurable emotions of tenderness . ' yup . 
   this narcissistic search for outlets for our tenderness has increased a million-fold with the dawn of the internet , when not only can we gawp at more images of destitute , destroyed kids , but we can republish them too , signalling our virtue and emotional sensitivity . 
  but showing dead kids is , in my mind , emotionally insensitive . 
  it can be cruel and unnecessary . 
  it 's the victory of the visceral over the rational . 
  and we really need a rational debate about the migrant crisis , rather than people holding up a dead-child snuff photo and saying : ` i cried , therefore i 'm good . ' double yup .
