   the tv presenter was standing on a rooftop in central france . 
  he pointed north : `` over there , people bake their food in butter . '' and then south : `` there , they use oil . 
  the border between those two zones runs right through this spot . '' this being a show about cookery rather than cartography , the next shot showed a steak baking in butter ( or oil , i forget ) . 
  i 'm still looking for the map that shows exactly where france is sliced in two by that culinary divide . 
    political borders are but one of many types of boundaries that demarcate the outer limits of the place we call home , or at least of that area where stuff looks , sounds and tastes familiar . 
  they usually are the most visible ones , though . 
  not just on the border , where the precarious embrace of two sovereign entities has solidified into barriers , buildings and a bureaucracy ; also on either side . 
  unavoidably , political borders exclude and oppose , dividing the larger from the smaller , the richer from the poorer , the weaker from the stronger . 
  as a practical consequence of their political nature , they often also mark the dividing line between one currency zone and another , or the limits between different types of electrical sockets .

   * they call themselves ` native french ' , invoke the ` resistance to the grand replacement ' or more generally to islam and immigration . 
  without necessarily being formally members or activists of a party , they are active on the internet to express their ideas , whether on social networks or on sites of ` alternative information ' , which form what they call ` reinfosphere ' . 
  *   * from fdesouche to dreuz through secular riposte , this ` reacosphere ' as it is sometimes called , is highly mobilized since thursday , 3 september . 
  with a goal : to try to thwart the mobilization born in solidarity with the refugees and that the distribution of a photo of aylan kurdi , three , drowned off the turkish coast , seems to have brightened . 
  all means are good to achieve it , including handling . 
  * * propaganda brigades are very real , and a serious nuisance on the net . 
  this article put the light on their actions and deconstruct their pseudo-arguments .
