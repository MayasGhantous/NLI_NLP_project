  * i do n't think that putin wants to take control over ukraine . 
  i would say that the rather prefers to destabilise it in order to turn it to a fail state , and therefore maintaining it outside of the european union , so to keep russian influence on it .

   * reinforced sanctions *   these restrictive measures will :   - strengthen restrictions on russia 's ** access to eu capital ** to five major russian state-owned banks  - prohibit ** trade in new bonds , equity or similar financial instruments ** with a maturity exceeding 30 days , issued by the same banks  - prohibit ** debt financing ** to three major russian defence companies and three major energy companies  - reinforce ** an export ban for dual use goods ** and technology for military end users to also include a list of nine mixed defence companies  - curtail russian access to services necessary for deep water oil exploration and production , arctic oil exploration or production and shale oil projects  * asset freeze and visa ban *   24 persons have been added to the list . 
  it now includes the new leadership in donbass , the government of crimea as well as certain russian decision-makers and oligarchs . 
  this brings the number of persons and entities under eu restrictions over the situation in ukraine to ** 119 persons and 23 entities ** . 
  * well , it is a speciality of the french governments to over-guess the growth ; every time the reality is lower than their forecast . 
  therefore , all their calculus become wrong . 
  * * but as gambling on an expected growth stronger than the real one is the only way to present a budget politically acceptable , politics lie systematically . 
  merci . 
  we work very hard for this :p *,
