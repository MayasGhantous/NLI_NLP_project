  i can only invite you to ( re ) read the works of philosophers on freedom . 
  locke , voltaire , aristote , etc. 
  * freedom of speech is welcome on r/europe , but with the european approach and not the american one . 
  comme tu le dis toi-m\u00eame : * why do you complain about the downvotes ? 
  as you said yourself : *  let the free market , aka votes do the thing ... 
   if mods were doing their jobs they would be cross referencing the ips in this thread and deleting everything from the same fucking user or group of users . 
  * i do n't think that you really understood how moderation works on reddit , and what the moderators of a subreddit can do -- or not .
