  *  ** quick notes about hdev video **   black image = international space station ( iss ) is on the night side of the earth . 
    no audio = normal . 
  there is no audio by design . 
  add your own soundtrack . 
    for a display of the real time iss location plus the hdev imagery , visit here : http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/hdev/   the high definition earth viewing ( hdev ) experiment aboard the iss was activated april 30 , 2014 . 
  it is mounted on the external payload facility of the european space agency 's columbus module . 
  this experiment includes several commercial hd video cameras aimed at the earth which are enclosed in a pressurized and temperature controlled housing . 
  video from these cameras is transmitted back to earth and also streamed live on this channel . 
  while the experiment is operational , views will typically sequence though the different cameras . 
  between camera switches , a gray and then black color slate will briefly appear . 
  since the iss is in darkness during part of each orbit , the images will be dark at those times . 
  during periods of loss of signal with the ground or when hdev is not operating , a gray color slate or previously recorded video may be seen . 
    analysis of this experiment will be conducted to assess the effects of the space environment on the equipment and video quality which may help decisions about cameras for future missions .
