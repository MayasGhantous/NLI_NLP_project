  ici : * this is an artistic performance from the group [ laibach ] ( http://www.laibach.org ) . 
  here : *  address in honour of the attendance of the group laibach at the bavarian state theatre in munich , germany  residenztheater , april 2015  written by milo rau  and presented by  sanja mitrovi\u0107 , sudbin musi\u0107 ,  vedrana seksan , valery tscheplanowa  and manfred zapatka . 
   stage + costume : anton lukas  camera + videodesign : marc stephan  light : uwe gr\u00fcnewald  dramaturgy : stefan bl\u00e4ske + sebastian huber  subtitles translation : julia reichert  laibach is a music and cross-media group from slovenia established on the 1st of june , 1980 in trbovlje . 
  the name of the band is the historic german version of the name slovenia 's capital ljubljana . 
  from the start laibach has developed a `` gesamtkunstwerk '' -- multi-disciplinary art practice in all fields ranging from popular culture to art ( collages , photo-copies , posters , graphics , paintings , videos , installations , concerts and performances ) . 
  since their beginnings the group was associated and surrounded with controversy , provoking strong reactions from political authorities of former yugoslavia and in particular in the socialist republic of slovenia . 
  their militaristic self-stylisation , propagandist manifestos and totalitarian statements have raised many debates on their actual artistic and political positioning . 
  many important theorists , among them boris groys and slavoj \u017di\u017eek , have discussed the laibach phenomenon both from an analytical as well as critical cultural point of view . 
  the main elements of laibach 's varied practices are : strong references to avant-garde art history , nazi-kunst and socialist realism for their production of visual art , de-individualisation in their public performances as an anonymous quartet dressed in uniforms , conceptual proclamations , and forceful sonic stage performances -- mainly labelled as industrial ( pop ) music . 
  laibach is practicing collective work , dismantling individual authorship and establishing the principle of hyper-identification . 
  in 1983 they have invented and defined the historic term ` retro-avant-garde ' . 
  they creatively questioned artistic ` quotation ' , appropriation , re-contextualisation , copyright and copy-left .
