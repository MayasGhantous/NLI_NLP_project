  although starting out as both an art and music collective , laibach became internationally renowned foremost on the music scene , particularly with their unique cover-versions and interpretations of hits by queen , the rolling stones , the beatles , etc. 
    in 1984 laibach initiated the founding of the wider collective of nsk ( neue slowenische kunst ) together with the painters from the group irwin and the theatre group scipion nasice sisters . 
  this led to the establishment of a strong platform for social , cultural and political activity within the climate of liberalisation and pluralisation in 1980 's yugoslavia . 
  nsk existed as a synchronised movement till 1992 , later partly changing itself into a virtual nsk state in time . 
  limited collaboration between the groups continued till 1995 and beyond . 
    after the break-up of yugoslavia in 1991 , laibach continued mostly within the realm of popular music , while remaining a point of reference in terms of artistic cultural criticism . 
  during recent years the group underwent an international re-evaluation of their artistic practice in the course of an emergence of post-structuralist views on worldwide conceptual art production .

   a propaganda event in paris on thursday was supposed to showcase tel aviv as a beacon of fun and tolerance . 
    instead , `` tel aviv sur seine '' ( tel aviv on the seine ) turned into more of a real life taste of israeli military occupation and a public relations disaster for its organizers . 
    the party at a simulated beach on the banks of the river seine was supposed to celebrate `` israeli nightlife '' and carefree living . 
  instead it was surrounded by hundreds of riot police and only accessible through a checkpoint . 
    police violently removed a peaceful sit-in by palestine solidarity activists outraged at what they saw as the paris city government 's whitewashing of israeli crimes . 
    police also coordinated `` security '' with the extremist group ligue de d\u00e9fense juive ( ldj ) , the french counterpart of the jewish defense league .
