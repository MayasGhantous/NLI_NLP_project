   * ` egypt and saudi arabia are desperate to buy two mistral ' says a french official source . 
  ` the king salman of saudi arabia wants to be a fleet worthy of the name in egypt , which could have a regional force projection , in the red sea and the mediterranean , ' said this source . 
  ` there is a marked interest shown by some countries in the region for mistral in view of the establishment of a maritime force . 
  these are facilities that have proven effective , ' confirms a diplomatic source . 
   france , the eu 's largest wheat producer and exporter , could see a record crop . 
  the current record , which was achieved in 1998 , stands at 38.2 million tons . 
    agritel is predicting a wheat crop of 38.9 million tons . 
  despite the hot and dry conditions in the early summer , plants developed very well and were in excellent condition by the time they were ready for harvesting . 
    according to a statement from the euronext futures exchange , the two largest french silo operators , socomac and senalia , are not currently accepting any new wheat deliveries because their capacities are exhausted . 
    despite the expectations of a record crop in france , the most-active forward contract for eu wheat with a december maturity date gained 2 % in the past three days and is currently priced at $ 186 per ton , says commerzbank . 
  * possibly , it would also be an excellent year for wine ( i am just saying ) . 
  expect lowing of prices for the cereal based products .

  -- * the new measurements in the heart of the mercantour national park , between 2440 and 2540 meters above sea level in the area of the col de la bonette-restefond on the border between the departments of alpes de haute-provence and alpes maritimes , show that : * - * a 1 meter above the ground , hundreds of square meters , the radiation level is still more than 2 times higher than normal . 
  these high levels of radiation are due to the residual soil contamination by cesium 137 mainly due to fallout from the chernobyl disaster . 
  the massive radioactive releases from the damaged reactor have led particularly intense radioactive deposits in the southeast of france and in particular in the mountains . 
  * - * in addition , depending on the topography , climatic conditions , the nature of the vegetation cover and the type of soil , radioactive metal that is deposited over large areas could be redistributed and induce very high accumulations . 
  the radiation levels in ground contact always exceed the accumulation zones , values several dozen times or more than 100 times higher than the natural level ( see annex 1 ) .
