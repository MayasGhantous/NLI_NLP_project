   * a two speeds mobilization ? 
  a sudden disinterest for this incident summer ? 
  it 's mostly that , hours after the revelation of the case , the reasons for the altercation seem to be increasingly blurred and the revolt ... more and more diluted . 
  the local newspaper the union is the first to report the facts , saying : `` appalled by such a speech smelling of religious police , the young woman fights back by retorting that does not have to dictate the way clothe themselves . '', 
  an expression taken in stride by other media and whose internet users on social networks , revel . 
  very quickly , the extreme right comments multiply , amalgamating the assault to islam , while reims committee of sos racism called the rally to `` refuse a body that reduces our liberties . 
  '' * * as usual , it is an non-profit organisation for the `` defence '' of the citizens which choose to exploit an event for promoting its ideology .
