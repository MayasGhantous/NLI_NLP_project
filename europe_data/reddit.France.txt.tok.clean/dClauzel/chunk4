   i ca n't speak about it in hungarian because i do n't know what is a `` monad '' or `` operator overloading '' or something in translation . 
  * we have a long learning tradition of informatics in french , including at the university . 
  in fact , until in the middle of the 80s , there was programming languages with a native french syntax in the french industry . 
  in informatics courses , except for the languages themselves , everything is in french . 
  * but announcing it just days before a critical referendum , which curiously had taken a unfavourable turn for england ? 
  noooooo , just random chance , very certainly . 
   just to show you how annoying it is when people post articles in completely irrelevant languages that nobody speaks faisons tous un c\u00e2lin \u00e0 ce norv\u00e9gien aigri devant la [ francophonie ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/francophonie ) :d google translate fonctionne ( suffisamment ) bien . 
  * let 's all give a hug to this bitter norwegian in front of * la [ francophonie ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/francophonie ) * :d * * google tanslate works fine ( enough ) . 
  i use it daily for scientific publications in czech and dutch . 
  * personally , i became de facto french-english bilingual , because of my studies and my work . 
  english is my second foreign language after german . 
  i read books in english , and often work in this language even if french remains my main working language . 
  * * i do n't think and do n't work the same way in french or in english , and especially less orally . 
  my written english is very academically shaped , as i use it in this way for my work . 
  but my oral english is very common , because i really developed it in the streets of middlesbrough ( so you can imagine my accent ) . 
  * * even for a bilingual person , the cognitive processes differ according to the language . 
  grammar and vocabulary impact on the reasoning , and shades are lost in translation . 
  * * for reddit , i first write my commentaries in french , then i express them again in english . 
  this explain the distinct nuances in phrasing , and even seldom in meaning , because i think 2 times for saying the same thing . 
  :d * depends : are the photos in the celebgate archives ? 
  it is not like this news could have been announced sooner or later : it is about the communication of the royal family of england , eh ; so they know exactly what they are doing ... *, 
  le remboursement va \u00eatre compliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir ... * it will be difficult to get a refund ... * * short story : russia provided very few informations on the problem , but it definitely comes from their side of the launch . 
  the future use of soyouz for the european space missions is in debate . 
  * i like this one : to send the army in ukraine for `` protecting the population of crimea from anarchy and violence '' . 
  also , a separatist leader claims that the russian soldiers are fighting in ukraine , yes , but only during their vacation time . 
  * the treaties do n't have provisions concerning the separation of a part of a country member of the union . 
  it would probably be an improvisation , which is not necessarily a bad thing : if there is a good enough consensus on that scotland can be decreed a member of the union , it will go smoothly . 
  it will depend of the existence of one or two nose-pickers who would want to crush the process . 
  * ( eh , nice french !, 
  my deutsch is to bad for writing , but i can still read , 
  mais je crois bien que suite \u00e0 la [ r\u00e9forme de 1991 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rectifications_orthographiques_du_fran%c3%a7ais_en_1990 ) , l\u2019orthographe pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e est en effet devenue `` popcorn '' . 
  * it depends . 
  `` pop-corn '' is a word directly imported , so the spelling is imprecise because it is the use that prevails . 
  but i think that following the [ reform of 1991 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rectifications_orthographiques_du_fran%c3%a7ais_en_1990 ) , the preconised orthograph has become `` popcorn '' . 
  * yes , i also thing so . 
  it is the same thing for the european union : scotland will have to apply to join it . 
  honn\u00eatement , c\u2019est assez compliqu\u00e9 pour un fran\u00e7ais de s ' y retrouver facilement dans les [ d\u00e9nominations anglaises ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/british_isles_euler_diagram_15.svg/1260px-british_isles_euler_diagram_15.svg.png ) . 
  choisissez qui vous ( ne ) voulez ( pas ) \u00eatre dans ma phrase  * honestly , it is quite difficult for a french to manage the [ english names ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/british_isles_euler_diagram_15.svg/1260px-british_isles_euler_diagram_15.svg.png ) . 
  choose who you ( do n't ) want to be in my sentence  *, 
  * not only lines , because in the case of scotland it would be a wall and several seas . 
  `` i want my money back '' , ukip , refusing to be part of the schengen space , refusing to join the eurozone , refusing to construct an european army , refusing to have a common foreign politics , etc. 
  so the british slowdown in case of split would not be very strong  *, 
  hein ? 
  [ la vieille alliance ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/auld_alliance ) en t\u00e9moigne . 
  * what ? 
  scots and frenchs are friends since more than 1000 years . 
  [ the auld alliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auld_alliance ) testifies of this . 
  if one talks english and one does not wear a kilt , one is a rosbif :p *, 
  beaucoup de pop-corn . 
  :p * i feel that i am going to need some pop-corn for watching all of this . 
  a lot of pop-corn . 
  independence for scotland !, 
  oust the british out of your lands !, 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  * there are several projects -- local in some places , and global to paris -- for using all this space . 
  paris is absolutely overpopulated , very concentrated , and every square metre is expensive . 
  the interest is real , but there are political conflicts between the various projects ( housing , offices , shops , green spaces , etc ) . 
  * it is a nice place to have a walk . 
  there are nice places , access to the catacombs , and also some interesting people who live here . 
  it is really a place -- for the moment -- forgotten from the rest of paris . 
  * short story : russian embargo on polish apples . 
  polish people want to help their country , but are fed up to eat apple . 
  therefore , they are turning them into alcohol . 
  * rien que pour les aider , je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 demander la double nationalit\u00e9 franco-polonaise :p * just for helping them , i am ready to ask for the french-polish double nationality :p *, 
  * short story : one of the french * territoires d\u2019outre-mer * ( the oversea territories ) is wallis-et-futuna , an archipelago composed of three kingdoms ( with protection of the local customs as long as they are not opposed to the general principles of * la r\u00e9publique * , etc. ) . 
  the monarchies are non-hereditary , the power move from one family to another . 
  * * for various reasons , the king kapeliele faupalahas has fired his prime minister , which pissed of the princely families . 
  so in response they fired him . 
  * * and now , somewhere in france , people are beginning to choose a new king :d * * the article is mainly a recall about the specificities of wallis-et-futuna , when it comes to the law . 
  very interesting ... if you care about the island wallis , futuna , and alofi . 
  they are very important for us , because we do n't have a lot of territories in this part of the world . 
  * targeting drilling equipments ? 
  putin is not going to like this at all : russia only survive thanks to its exportations of hydrocarbons . 
  * pages 8 to 10 are the most interesting : comparison of public approval for the last presidents , and public approval from the main categories of the population ( age , level of education , income , political affiliation , etc ) . 
  * * tl ; dr the pr\u00e9sident hollande is in the corner , and nobody is motivated for taking blows for him , except for his last groupies . 
  * proceed , none of them is loved . 
  in every cases we win . 
  * the uk is getting more and more annoying , complaining about those so-called `` european attacks against our freedom '' . 
  looks like it would be better off with / r/murica . 
  * we have a saying about our politics : `` all are rotten '' . 
  miracle !, 
  did pr\u00e9sident hollande at least found himself a pair of balls ? 
  or maybe even for him it became too difficult not to make a decision ? 
  we do n't nickname him [ flanby ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flanby ) for nothing ... *, 
  * so you are in favour of delivering warships to putin , so he can use them in his military conquests against other european countries ? 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  * how to deploy troops without admitting it . 
  this is frankly lacking of honesty . 
  * shit , i did no get the m\u00e9mo !, 
  is there a processing somewhere ? 
  hollande est surtout attach\u00e9 aux 2 milliards d\u2019euros du carnet de commandes . 
  * oh , do n't worry . 
  it is only the president hollande who insist for maintaining the sell of warships to russia . 
  his justification : `` the word of france is sacred '' ( however we are a strongly secular country , but let 's let it pass ) . 
  hollande is mainly interested in the 2 milliards euros of the commands book . 
  the citizens are rather outraged that he is still thinking about it , given the circumstances . 
  nop : regarde mon insigne  * nop : look at my flair  *,
