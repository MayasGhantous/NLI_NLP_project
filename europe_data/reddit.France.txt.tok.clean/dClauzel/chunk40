   but that has changed and now we have the sub filled with opinion pieces posted by redditors who post opinion pieces . 
  yep , i agree .

   what 's different is the amount of posts , reposts , and editorialized titles .

  only one article would be enough , but people insist to post their link *, 
   french has many `` why do n't we have a word for that ? '' words and even more that are just plain beautiful . 
  here 's a short list of my 9 favorite french words . 
  * d\u00e9payser * : verb : to leave your comfort zone 2 . 
  * nombrilisme * : noun : self-centeredness , egoism , self-absorption 3 . 
  * vachement * : adverb : very , truly 4 . 
  * avoir le cafard * : idiom : to be depressed 6 . 
  * chou * : noun : cabbage ; adj : cute 7 . 
  * ronronner * : verb : to purr 8 . 
  * d\u00e9panneur * : noun : repair person ( european french ) ; corner store ( qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois french ), 
  * yes , 400k subscribers , 88 ^ th biggest subreddit , and a strong progression : the subreddits before us have a low growth ( ~ 100-300 / day ) while we have a high one ( ~ 1k/day ) . 
  the current trend shows a stabilisation at the 55 ^ th place on the top chart .

  * the normans who conquered england were french , spoke french , and were at the service of the king of france . 
  and this for more than one century . 
  * * only english nationalists claim that it was not the french who did conquered england but barbarians vikings ; the proof being that french became there the official language , and not a scandinavian one . 
  * and so the americans call us `` insensible '' and `` rude '' . 
  but we just have a good judgement , a critical mind , and an aversion for common drama . 
  bien s\u00fbr , cette b\u00eatise n\u2019est que pour l\u2019uk ; la france n\u2019est pas concern\u00e9e * of course , this idiocy is only for the uk ; france is not concerned *, 
  m\u00eame diff\u00e9rence * `` mim\u00e9tisation '' is not correct , but it would be `` mim\u00e9tisme '' .

  * to burn cars has become a kind of tradition on new year 's day . 
  it was pointedly strongly diminishing with time .

  disambiguations are also ok ; for example replacing `` he did that '' by `` [ mr something ] did that '' .

    until recently there was no one word in any language to explain this war trick . 
  sometimes a whole paragraph was required to explain this military practice . 
  hereafter one word , a french word , will save all this needless writing and reading . 
  * camouflage * is the new word , and it means `` fooling the enemy . '', 
  example : -- a dead horse lay between the british and german lines on a bit of rising ground . 
  during the night the dead horse was removed and an imitation , with a man inside , was substituted . 
  the men who constructed and painted the fake horse practiced * camouflage * . 
  they are known as * camoufleurs * .
