   ** the industry behind champagne production has been handed world heritage status by the united nations ' cultural arm . 
  **   unesco decided that the vineyards , wine cellars and sales houses where champagne is produced and sold were culturally significant . 
    it was one of 11 sites given world heritage status by unesco at a meeting in germany on saturday . 
    the status should ensure the sites receive special protection in future . 
    unesco said the champagne industry was `` a very specialised artisan activity that has become an agro-industrial enterprise . '', 
    its addition to the list - that already includes macchu picchu in peru , the taj mahal in india and the great wall of china - could bring extra financial aid and more tourists . 
    the vineyards of burgundy , in france , were also given world heritage status on saturday . 
  * being born in reims and having growing up there , i can only approve . 
   first it was the calamity of the french trains too fat for platforms . 
  now french rail chiefs have been left embarrassed by a new fleet of regional trains that are too high to get through the tunnels into italy . 
   [ ... ]  the bungle echoed a similar gaffe last year when french rail operators admitted they had to adjust 1,300 platforms after ordering hundreds of new trains that were too fat for stations , costing them $ 50 million . 
  * again the same mistake ? 
  not at all . 
  * * in fact , the story is simple , and journalists are wrong . 
  * * the r\u00e9gion paca has ordered some trains with the greatest possible capacity , with the objective to travel into france . 
  the manufacturer naturally takes the norm of the standard french tunnel size for having the most space possible . 
  the r\u00e9gion paca then said `` oh these trains are nice , what if we send them to vintimille ? '' . 
  vintimille is in italy , so the tunnel is not covered by the specifications . 
  therefor construction work is planned for improving the tunnel up to the international standards ( it is an old obsolete tunnel ) . 
  so the sncf firstly set up a partial service , but as usual it takes a little more time to adapt infrastructure .

  merci de ( re ) lire les [ r\u00e8gles de la communaut\u00e9 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) * . 
  please ( re ) read the [ community rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) *  3.1 ) we request that users who post non-english articles also post a translation ( even if just a machine translation ) to help the forum engage with the post . 
  however , this is only a request , and posts will not be removed for this reason . 
  * when an account created 10 days ago has for only activity to post links on issues related to religion or territorial disputes , there is very little doubt to have . 
  * * when no cleaning is done ( automod broken , no moderators connected , etc. 
  ) , very quickly the subredditbecomes polluted by people using it as a propaganda platform . 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
   another way to deal with this problem - is to call it out in comments ?? 
  * yes , exactly !, 
  and if necessary , also flag the submission and/or the user . 
  the moderation team will then have a look and decide if indeed there is something fishy , and will behead the troublemaker . 
  * posters can themselves assign a flair to their submission ( news , opinion , etc ) . 
  unfortunately , it is not possible to do it automatically . 
  * it is up to the community members to vote for what they want to promote , and to report spam and problematic contents . 
  * * we clean up here as much as possible to counter the agendas pushers , but some always pass through . 
  * no , i am kidding : we all loath this administration which is as much tentacular as it is inefficient . 
  * while we 're dying of heat everywhere , tomorrow they announce 22 \u2103 at brest . 
  * * i therefore propose to set fire to britain . 
  it will be fully justified . 
   `` argh , my brain is melting , when is it going to stop , 7 days ?!, 
  * perfect , it is exactly this .
