  *  *** bannable ***   1.1 ** bigotry , hate speech and xenophobia ** of any form ( sexism , racism , homophobia , islamophobia , russophobia , anti-semitism , et al ) are not tolerated here . 
  to provide further clarity , we here is a small list of examples . 
  please use your common sense to interpret this rule . 
    * it is ok to criticise immigration . 
    * it is ok to criticise members of minority groups . 
    * it is not ok to suggest that members of different cultures or races are incapable of cohabiting . 
    * it is not ok to suggest that some races or cultures are inherently better than others . 
    * it is not ok to make pejorative statements about large cultural , national or ethnic groups ** especially when ** these groups are not entered into by choice ( e.g. 
  race , gender , sexuality ) . 
    * additionally , ** holocaust denial ** ( of either the 1915 armenian genocide or the 1941-5 holocaust of the jews , homosexuals , the disabled , jehovah 's witnesses , etc. ), 
  is completely ** un ** acceptable . 
  * [ article 10 of the european convention on human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_10_of_the_european_convention_on_human_rights ) *  * 1 ) everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting , television or cinema enterprises .

  pas de censure \u00e0 proprement parl\u00e9 , juste l\u2019application des [ r\u00e8gles ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) . 
  * no censure per se , just the [ rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) enforcement . 
  * * also , freedom of speech has not the same meaning in europe than in the united states ; so people with american culture sometimes have false ideas on how discussions are handled here . 
  * i delisted this submission because the article 's title has been editorialised . 
  to editorialise titles is bad . 
  i invite you to resubmit this link with using the original title . 
  * * to expand a title for precising it is ok ( `` blabla -- a short text '' ) . 
  disambiguations are also ok ; for example replacing `` he did that '' by `` [ mr something ] did that '' . 
  * i am not convinced by a purely accounting argument . 
  the concorde was not financially profitable , and yet it was used and promoted . 
  * the a380 is a very specific plane , which meets specific needs and forces to have appropriate infrastructures . 
  not the most convenient thing , but it is actually useful for massive transport of people and goods .

  * i can stop myself to notice that most of the time , the english are the ones asking that the english language becomes the only language in europe . 
  i think not . 
  it was published long ago enough so it was ok . 
  but having the same link every few days over and over is not : it pollutes the front page with reposts , so they are simply immediately delisted . 
  your submission did n't trigger the reddit 's duplicate warning because the url is not exactly the same : the coordinates parameters differ .

  thanks !, 
  * to editorialise titles is bad . 
  * * to expand a title for precising it is ok ( `` blabla -- a short text '' ) . 
  disambiguations are also ok ; for example replacing `` he did that '' by `` [ mr something ] did that '' . 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  * often , reminding people of the rules is enough . 
  systematic sanctioning is counter-productive .
