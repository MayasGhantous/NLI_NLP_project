  in 2030 , it will be a monstrous mess in your society and economy : everyone will be retired , and there will be nobody to take over . 
  * * in france , we take great care of our birth rate . 
  it 's expensive , but it will help us not to sink in 2050 with the rest of european countries . 
  * this is currently changing , we are currently in a reform/update of the curriculum ( not my domain , i am teaching hard sciences at the university ) , so it is not yet fixed . 
  but the focus should be on reforms and social aspects , and less on military matters .

  * submissions flairs are a work in progress , patience !, 
  * so first it is ` supposedly own ' and not ` own ' . 
  then these are the figures reported by the lobbies gunsmiths . 
  * * this 32 % comes out nowhere out of this paragraph : *  * patrice bouveret , president of the observatory of arms transfers in lyon , figures there are of 20 million weapons in france : ` small arms have a lifespan extremely long , at least fifty or sixty years . 
  in some searches , the police still find weapons dating from the second world war . 
  all these weapons , those of our grandfathers , are not reported . 
  it is extremely difficult to know what it is . 
  besides all that concerns of organised crime , which we know even less . 
  ' * * so it does not mean anything since it brings together historical weapons ( grandpa 's gun during the war ) , the hunting rifles , non-lethal weapons for defence , etc. 
  it is the sum of everything , divided by the number of french citizen . 
  it is a stat that makes no sense . 
   the legal expert who reported to the council of state said the woman 's interviews with social services revealed that `` she lives almost as a recluse , isolated from french society '' . 
    the report said : `` she has no idea about the secular state or the right to vote . 
  she lives in total submission to her male relatives . 
  she seems to find this normal and the idea of challenging it has never crossed her mind . '', 
    the woman had said she was not veiled when she lived in morocco and had worn the burqa since arriving in france at the request of her husband . 
  she said she wore it more from habit than conviction . 
  yup . 
   they used a hunting rifle , many french people own them ( 32 % ) . 
  * reference required , because this number surprises me greatly . 
  * / r/reims and / r/france are your friends !, 
  * yes , this is precisely the idea . 
   thirty years after the signature of the schengen agreements , how do european citizens and foreigners travel in europe ? 
  why some countries continue to request identification to cross the border while others only check baggage ?
