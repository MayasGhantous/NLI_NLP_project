  * i completely agree . 
  do n't shoot the messenger , especially when her message is important . 
  marine le pen is problematic , this is true . 
  but transparency on ttip is crucial . 
  but what the hell are you exporting ? 
  ( honestly , i have no idea ) *, 
  * excellent remarque : inner trade is far more important in volume and value than the exchanges with the rest of the world . 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  faites-le aussi pour la france , qu\u2019on puisse se moquer des anglais ensemble :d * do it also for france , so we can laugh together at the english expense :d *, 
  * what !? 
  blocking transparency on ttip only for preventing visibility for le pen ? 
  this is absolutely counter-productive , especially in the regard of how citizens are protesting this agreement and the way it is push forward . 
  the oversee territories are important : they are the ones who produce the rhum :p *, 
  * not enough cheeses , not enough ~ ~ wines ~ ~ alcohols . 
  :p * the uk blaming the european union ? 
  come oooooon , this is cliched . 
  elle a toujours eu des go\u00fbts \u00e9tranges :p * germany probably wants some tulips for decorating its lawn . 
  it always had strange tastes :p *,

  * * bonus : nobody imports from the uk -- not even the commonwealth ( which is funny given the name  , but france can still relay upon its former colonies :d *, 
  * contact the elected members of your parliament , for asking them to take strong actions against russia . 
  europe is blocked for political reasons , so we have to act on this .

  * ( also , nice french :d ), 
  oui , la chine est dans une situation semblable \u00e0 la russie avec ses minorit\u00e9s et sa politique d\u2019 `` int\u00e9gration '' des r\u00e9gions frontali\u00e8res , alors ... * yes , china is in a similar situation than russia , with its minorities and its `` integration '' politic of border regions , so ... *, 
  * flaki ? 
  aucun probl\u00e8me , \u00e0 part que parler de tout \u00e7a m ' a donn\u00e9 faim :p * no problem , except than speaking of all this made me hungry :p *, 
  the lover of uist ( whatever that is ) ? 
  * yes , the main problem is the holdback from the businesses : they are afraid to have an income problem , so they do n't invest and do n't spend . 
  therefore , everything run in slow motion . 
  * i do n't know her ( we do n't know who she is , in france ) , i have no opinion on her . 
  yep . 
  yep . 
  i did work with a finish colleague , and i never could get to appreciate it .

  * [ horse meat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horse_meat ) is delicious , full of flavours , and tender . 
  it is also healthy , with a lot a iron , and few lipides . 
   * but sir , everybody like the french cuisine !, 
  * no problem : europe is grounded on multilingualism . 
  every citizen has the right to be able to interact with the institutions in the european language of his choice .

   tusk 's difficulty is that he speaks no french and only poor english [ ... ] he understands german tssss . 
  * tssss . 
  mastering at least one foreign language is really important . 
  * i have been doing it for a while , but i am not very present here . 
  good thing if some people appreciate it !, 
  :p * a canadian saying this ... i suppose that you are not qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ? 
   it was bullshit that russia was rewarded for starting wwii with germany as an ally . 
  look at what happen on the east front , and what were the consequences on the west one . 
  * history taught us that `` [ impossible n\u2019est pas fran\u00e7ais ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/impossible_n'est_pas_fran%c3%a7ais ) ''  . 
  ok , in this cases napol\u00e9on was speaking about his [ polish ] ( / r/polandball ) troops ... but they delivered . 
  * putin is either bluffing or mental . 
  in both cases , he must be neutralised . 
  nop , on aime juste couvrir toutes les possibilit\u00e9s  * nop , we just like to cover all possibilities  *, 
  * it is not arrogance , but confidence . 
  bravo . 
  mais bon , il y aurait de bien plus mauvais choix ... * he is only a likely possibility , nothing is certain in the candidatures . 
  i am torn about him : he is indeed pro-european , but with an approach very oriented on the economy , sometimes in the detriment of the citizens and for the benefit of the big companies . 
  * there are so many good things in this text that it is too long to name them all : digital id card , signature , seal , timestamp , registered letter , etc. 
  * * at least we will be able to reliably work with identities in europe ... for no latter than july 2020 . 
  * and for an explanation , a simple `` oups , sorry , i did walk on your border , lol '' ? 
  let 's remember the precedent case of the soldiers ' geotagged photos published on instagram . 
  mais ta proposition est tentante  * * sadly , i would need a job in order to go living in old riga . 
  but your offer is tempting  *, 
   seriously , how often do french ministers and prime ministers resign ? 
  * currently , every 2 or 3 years . 
  impopularity -- fueled by the clientelism of political parties -- increases quickly . 
  * the artistic view is less cruel than reality .

  * yes !, 
  foie gras can be made with -- and only with -- goose or duck . 
  duck has a fuller flavour , and goose has a smoother one . 
  both are delicious , with a touch of [ piment d\u2019espelette ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/piment_d'espelette ) on roast bread . 
  all the rest is p\u00e2t\u00e9 . 
  * yep . 
  people do n't think -- and therefore do n't write -- exactly the same way in different languages . 
  it is related to the way and context you learned each one . 
  tu penses au [ foie gras ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/foie_gras ) ? 
  trrrrrr !, 
  * you think of [ foie gras ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/foie_gras ) ? 
  trrrrrr !, 
  food police !, 
  foie gras is not p\u00e2t\u00e9 , it is ... foie gras :d on can in fact find some foie gras p\u00e2t\u00e9 , which is not a foie gras but a p\u00e2t\u00e9 . 
  * sadly , there are quite a lot of people here who furiously downvote everything that is not in english . 
  plainly boring , and stupid : europe is founded on multilingusim .
