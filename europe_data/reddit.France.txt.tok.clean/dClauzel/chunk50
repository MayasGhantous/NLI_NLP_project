  * yes , it is . 
  it is about the uk flying nuclear missiles over europe , where is france . 
  * one only just need a few nuclear bombs to sterilise a whole country . 
  the number argument does not hold .

  * france has also a nuclear arsenal , moreover one that absolutely does not depend of americans for maintenance and use authorisation . 
  super , toute l\u2019europe est entre les 2 ... * american nuclear missiles in great-britain for countering russia ?

  * and stomach burns , too . 
  non , c\u2019est juste une blague d\u2019un perfide mod\u00e9rateur albionais * no , just a joke from a perfidious albiones moderator *, 
  * then you use your ... * ace of base * !,

  * hush , it 's the french secret agenda . 
  * * more seriously , we needed to have submissions with different scores . 
  we needed a victim , i chose to sacrifice the albionese . 
  who could blame me ? 
  * we are currently testing a lot of things . 
  we will come to it !,

  * yes , there will be a night mode for res .

  * some people are currently working very hard in / r/europedev for preparing you the next design of our subreddit . 
  it is a work in progress , so it will continue improve . 
  * * if you want to give your opinion , this is the occasion !, 
  * yes , they would not be choosable by the members . 
  * very easy to do : we ( mod ) just manually force assign a flair to a member . 
  * very probably . 
  we just need for him to be motivated to help . 
  * i delisted this submission because it is a random local news . 
  * would you like to come working with us on / r/eurodev ? 
   god damnit !, 
  why are all the other subreddits so much fancier ? 
  * because they have web designers , and not us ? 
   btw : why did n't they translate the `` news '' flair ? 
  / * currently technically difficult to do *, 
   have two tags for each post impossible techniquement . 
  * technically impossible . 
  or would require a very long list of possible flairs * * the graphic work itself will come later ; we are beginning to think about it on / r/europedev ( come participate if you want !, 
  merci !, 
  * thank you !, 
  * * i 'm not sure of the value of having a badge for immigration : this is a transversal topic . 
  * * to have or not current matter badges as `` ( br | gr ) exit '' and `` ukraine '' makes sense , but will require work on the long run to continue to be added . 
  this will make a growing list , and eventually end up with dozens of badges ... we need to look at this , because in any case it is practical . 
  * * i would merge the flairs `` series '' and `` weekly news post '' , which are of the same category : specific regular thematic . 
  * * i love the idea of separating `` editorial '' / `` reporting '' , as it allows to make immediately the difference between a work of formal publication ( proofread by a third party , etc. ),
