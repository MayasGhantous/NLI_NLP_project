  and a self-publishing one ( like a blog ) , even if it very well done . 
  i discovered that apparently this distinction is not implicit for everyone ( on the internet , all the informations are reliable and intelligent !, 
  mwouais , or not ) * * the definition of the categories is certainly one of the main things we need to define . 
  * if you are curious , here is the first report of this project that i wrote for the moderation team . 
  * --  so , yesterday evening [ i started the giant disco party , aka the first trial of the submission flairs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38kp7l/in_my_opinion_the_designcolors_of_new_topic/ ) . 
    the [ late announce ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38kp7l/in_my_opinion_the_designcolors_of_new_topic/crvrefn ) :     * at last !, 
  some people noticed the submission flairs and decided to give their opinions . 
  i was afraid that everybody suddenly became blind i plead guilty for those flairs , i am the one who started this project . 
  *     * __ currently , i am mostly interested to see how the community react __ ( for the moment , nearly not at all ) , and if the people are going to use them spontaneously . 
  *     * for the `` european union '' submission flair , obviously i used the official colours *     * after that , __ for the design , a better graphist than me would probably want to have a look at the flairs , for a smoother integration __ . 
  for the curious ones , [ the stylesheet is public ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/about/stylesheet/ ) . 
  *     * if you have some ideas , please do tell . 
  *   at this time , i am mostly interested in the usability ( do we gain something by having them ? ), 
  and the community reactions . 
  the graphical design not being important : it will be properly done later . 
    as expected , the first feedbacks are mostly on the visual aspects : it is the most immediate aspect and the easiest to comment . 
  but that is ok .   one of the secret objectives of this ninja launch of the submission flairs was to see how the community react : we did n't announce it , it just appears . 
  i was beginning to desperate when at last a user submitted an opinion thread , which i made sticky . 
    our community not just being a gathering of visitors with a group working to censor things , i was wanting to force the members to do the first step and to engage with the community . 
  it looks like we have * a lot * of work to do , here . 
  [ as a member is saying ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38kp7l/in_my_opinion_the_designcolors_of_new_topic/crvvdeb ) :    i really like , that you want people to engage with you as the moderator team , but i think that is a rather unusual approach and most users wo n't be used to it . 
  many users are used to tyrannical mods ( why actually i wonder ... ) . 
  so your actions - while well-meant and understandable with your explanation - may look more like whimsical acts of self-righteous rulers . 
  i think you need to establish this atmosphere of engagement and trust first and from the last meta-thread i certainly did not have that feeling yet . 
    some people have proposed to help to work on the css . 
  i am planing to organise the subreddit / r/europedev for doing this . 
  it will probably lead to do some heavy work on the css , and i welcome every help : i can do things that work with a simple design , but i am not a graphist . 
    your opinion on all this ? 
  ok , super !, 
  * ok , great !, 
  i am going to organise this during the weekend . 
  rappel : je suis daltonien ( dans le rouge ) * reminder : i am daltonien ( for the red ) *, 
  * i delisted this submission because there are no sources . 
  i invite you to add some . 
  * nop , tonight is disco night !, 
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=essh9-yxlqg&amp;?t=3s, 
  * this is the case ; we are pointedly currently working on the enforcement of this rule . 
  * i am completely for having thumbnails on submissions . 
  * yes , to force the size of the boxes allows to have a clean layout *, 
  ( hop , repassage \u00e0 gauche ) * it is very well a solution . 
  * * ( hop , switching back to the left ) *, 
  * i delisted this submission because it is a random local news . 
  * yes , i did my dev somewhere else . 
  at some point , nothing can replace real size tries on the field , and this first version allows us to get feedback from the community . 
  * * we could open a subreddit for working with willing people , this could be nice . 
  * yep , exactly . 
  this is why the flairs are better on the left of the title , properly aligned . 
  surprise , surprise ... \u2764, 
  * hop , moving the flairs on the right side of the title . 
  does it pleases you better ? 
  * * think to force reloading the page , for updating the layout . 
  * / r/london should welcome it . 
  * yes , numerous online newspapers do that . 
  it 's a good thing to profit from this dynamic aspect of digital publishing compared to frozen paper . 
  but almost no newspaper mention the title change . 
  ici , on travaille * play nice , kids . 
  we are working , here *, 
  * i delisted this submission because it is a random local news . 
  * i delisted this submission because it is a random local news . 
  ouuuuups , merci . 
  * yep , same system than the side bar 's filter for russia/ukraine/nato . 
  / r/france is a good example of use . 
  * at last !, 
  some people noticed the submission flairs and decided to give their opinions .

  * * if you have some ideas , please do tell . 
  * also delisted . 
  * i delisted this submission because it is a random local news . 
  le nouveau titre de l\u2019article est `` greece moves closer to eurozone exit after delaying $ 300m repayment to imf '' * the new article 's title is `` greece moves closer to eurozone exit after delaying $ 300m repayment to imf '' *, 
  * i wonder in which country of the european union it plans to install them , because the other members will certainly have a say . 
  * * and if he wants to install them in a non-eu countries , then it will create ever more problems . 
  * if he could also obtain the reimbursement of the russian loans , that would be nice . 
  * i delisted this submission because it is a random local news . 
  * i delisted this submission because the article 's title has been editorialised . 
  to editorialise titles is bad . 
  i invite you to resubmit this link with using the original title . 
  * i delisted this submission because it is a random local news . 
  c\u2019est un forum internet ** europ\u00e9en ** * yes , but this is even better !, 
  this is a __ european __ internet forum *, 
  * this is the problem : hence you know yugoslavia , but not the current countries . 
  * if you think you are in you right , please do not hesitate at all to contact the moderators team for asking the lift of your ban . 
  we really considerate every demand . 
  je valide cette soumission , mais n\u2019abusez pas * we are currently improving the subreddit 's rules on editorialisation . 
  i am validating this submission , but do n't abuse *, 
  * i am currently working to see how we can have user flairs for submissions *, 
  merci beaucoup !, 
  la transparence en action !, 
  * transparency in action !, 
  merci !, 
  non , j\u2019 ai de bons outils linguistiques * no , i do have some good linguistic tools *, 
  * this just in , russian migrants spotted crossing the mediterranean * again . 
  with a chinese escort in an peace operation led by israel around cyprus . 
  historiquement , la strat\u00e9gie du mouton noir a tr\u00e8s souvent bien fonctionn\u00e9 en europe * historically speaking , the black sheep strategy has very often well worked in europe *, 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  nop . 
  * nop .
