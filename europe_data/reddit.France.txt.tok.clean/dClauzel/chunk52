  i am part of the new moderators : so i did not worked on our own recruitment . 
  i discovered the chosen ones along everyone . 
  une bonne question . 
  * a good and fair question . 
  * * i was still in school when the different events in eastern europe occurred : the fall of the berlin wall , the explosion of the communist bloc , the ethnic massacres , conquests provinces , statements of independence/fusion/other , etc. 
  * * in short , the situation evolved very quickly . 
  too quickly for the school programs to be able to follow ( changing the manuals , preparing the new course ... ) , so we had very little `` fresh '' informations about everything . 
  this part of the program was instead subsequently reduced for the years in order to study something else . 
  * * not to mention that at this time there was no internet like now , and we were informed by the television and the press ( which are politicised ) . 
  * * later , i never had to do anything with people from the balkans ; the best i had was a colleague from macedonia ( skopje ) . 
  * * even today , the situation in the balkans is complex , and to relearn all the geopolitics of the region is not a short task , especially as it will need update in some time . 
  * * so if i do not know this region , it 's simply because i 've never really learned it . 
  * and this is a splendid victory from the glorious francophonie !, 
  * i saw the added nsfw / nsfl , so i revalidated it . 
  redelist it if you think this is not enough *, 
  * hello !, 
  * * we ( moderators ) did get your mail ; we are currently all reading it in details , with the comments added by people . 
  * --  we __ do n't expect you to become proficient in balkan history and politics . __ c\u2019est plut\u00f4t une bonne chose , car comme [ je le disais ailleurs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/389xz5/mod_post_regarding_the_recent_drama/cru110d ) :  tr\u00e8s honn\u00eatement , pour moi , l\u2019histoire des balkans est quelque chose de complexe , chiant , remplie de noms impronon\u00e7ables , compl\u00e8tement bord\u00e9lique , et qui se passe dans des r\u00e9gions lointaines . 
  * this is quite a good thing , because as [ i was saying somewhere else ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/389xz5/mod_post_regarding_the_recent_drama/cru110d ) : *  * honestly , for me , the history of the balkans is something complex , boring , full of unpronounceable names , completely messy , and that happens in distant regions . 
  i happily acknowledge that i hardly know anything about it . 
  in fact , i am even unable to list the countries that are there now , with their their borders , and statutes . 
  *   * the balkans are simply outside my area of expertise . 
  but it does interest me . 
  * * so i am taking all enlightened opinions from knowledgeable people .

   in its latest report on financial stability , the imf sounded the alarm . 
  its remarks , on retainer as usual , is not as explicit as ours . 
  le bilan is adding to the cyclical aspects noted by the imf , a structural analysis of the financial system .

   this is a major change for pc 's most popular gaming distribution platform , which has [ often butted heads with the eu 's consumer rights directive ] ( http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-20-making-sense-of-steams-refund-policy ) . 
  previously , eu law stated that consumers are allowed a 14 day return period for digital goods , but there 's the stipulation that users can waive this right once its `` performance '' has begun . 
  merci l\u2019europe !, 
  \u2764 * thanks europe !, 
  * thank you \u2764 * * it is pointedly because the meaning is lost or altered in the translations that it is interesting not to dissuade people to express themselves in their mother tongue . 
  bonne question . 
  * good question . 
  i have no idea about those 2 , for this subreddit or the countries of the european union . 
  * absolutely , thanks !, 
  this is the proof that i need coffee again . 
  tu as pari\u00e9 , et tu as perdu * you did bet , and you did lose *, 
  * nop , negationism is not authorised here ( and more generally in all over europe ) . 
  * i could , but sadly it would not serve the interest of la francophonie 's secret agenda start reading from the bottom !, 
  assure-toi de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce message * it is completely negotiable , as a golden parachute !, 
  make sure to use this message for reference *, 
  and the american english would be of bad taste : the british english is far more clean and elegant *, 
  si tu veux , je te ferais un morceau sur soundcloud * if you want , i will make a track on soundcloud for you *, 
  * yes , and more precisely a thin non-breakable space ( `` espace '' is here of the feminine grammatical gender , because this is the word used in printing ; this is not the same word that we usually see ) . 
  a thin non-breakable space before the colon , and a normal space after . 
  if you can not input a thin non-breakable space ( like here on reddit ) , then a non-breakable space will do the job . 
  * i write a lot of documents -- especially in xelatex -- so the french ( and also a bit of the british english one ) typography is something that i learn over time . 
  * i ( again ) call upon the jon snow 's clause : i know nothing , and especially on this . 
  the best is to ask the `` old moderators '' . 
  * currently i am mostly mechanically validating invitations to join things , and to answer to the people who summon me . 
  i have * a bit * of work to do , because that 's not reddit who is going to fill my fridge , eh . 
  patience !, 
  i am certain that tomorrow you will get answers to all your questions . 
  merci !, 
  me too , i love you *, 
  oui , je poste seulement en fran\u00e7ais quand je pousse en avant l\u2019agenda secret de la francophonie * yes , i only post in french when pushing forward the secret agenda of la francophonie *, 
  je poste seulement en fran\u00e7ais quand je pousse en avant l\u2019agenda secret de la francophonie * i only post in french when pushing forward the secret agenda of la francophonie *, 
  je devine un sous-entendu perfide ... * i smell a perfidious implied meaning ... *, 
  l\u2019histoire n ' a pas du franchir les pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es * honestly , it does not ring my bell at all . 
  this story must not have crossed the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es *, 
  rappel : [ le dernier duel officiel a eu lieu en france en 1967 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e68nuacsuwq ) , donc j\u2019 ai de bonne chance de gagner  * if there is a duel with swords , i choose either a [ rapi\u00e8re ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapi%c3%a8re ) with a [ main-gauche ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/main-gauche ) , either an [ \u00e9p\u00e9e b\u00e2tarde ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89p%c3%a9e_b%c3%a2tarde ) with a [ targe ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/targe ) , either a [ claymore ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/claymore_\\ ( % c3 % a9p % c3 % a9e \\ ) ) . 
  * * a reminder : [ the last official duel took place in france in 1967 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e68nuacsuwq ) , so i have a good chance to win  *, 
  mais je suis toujours l\u00e0 * i am not , as far as i know . 
  but i am still here *, 
  mais avec beaucoup moins de pot-de-vin ( je le regrette ) * but with far less bribes ( i wish we had ) *, 
  * we have quite number of pro-russian on / r/europe , submitting links to politically oriented articles . 
  it is a little bit of volume , but nothing too annoying . 
  they also post boring videos of unintelligible stuff , and cry foul about a plot-from-the-nato-being-a-puppet-of-the-usa-that-wants-to-destroy-the-righteous-unity-of-the-russian-people . 
  * * we also some groupies of various german empires who want to throw non-white people into the sea ( i am simplifying ) . 
  * * otherwise , some serbian and croatian mutually spiting on each others . 
  * * not to mention the pro and anti muslim/immigrant/european community migrant . 
  * * and of course , the ukip fanclub who vomit on the european union and who wants instead something we are not sure about ( but in any case it should be sovereign , without immigrants , and no binding rules of the european union ) . 
  * * it is especially the english-speaking communities which are invaded on social networks ; the french communities are virtually unaffected by these propaganda attacks ( and that 's good , we do not complain ) . 
  i requested a picture for clarification . 
  or better , a photo of theskynet demonstrating this, 
  * no idea , i am not the one handling this . 
  but i am certain that one way or the other it will go well . 
  it is just a bit of drama and incivilities . 
  * nothing special here , this is just the expected sign interpretation . 
  je poste seulement en fran\u00e7ais quand je pousse en avant l\u2019agenda secret de la francophonie * i only post in french when pushing forward the secret agenda of la francophonie *, 
  * i am not certain to be welcomed on / r/inglin . 
  weird , as the english originally speak my language * * these recommendations make sense because they are in the same thematic area ( europe ) ; but the cultural aspect is completely different , making them false . 
  patience !, 
  * i have no idea at all : it is `` handle internally '' . 
  i think we will know more in the evening .
