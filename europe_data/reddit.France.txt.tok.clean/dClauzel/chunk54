  * the french did not reject europe with this referendum : they rejected an opaque construction process , led by banks and large multinationals . 
  * * the french expect from europe that it put emphasis on the human , and not on the finance . 
   treaty change is a deeply sensitive matter in paris , where [ pr\u00e9sident ] hollande led the socialist party 's yes campaign in the referendum on the european constitution in 2005 . 
  he lost , while [ foreign minister ] fabius led the winning socialist party 's no campaign . 
  * but both of them are deeply europeans . 
  * the most popular republican symbol is by far [ marianne ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/marianne ) . 
  * * the different [ coats of arms ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/blasons_de_france ) are also well known and used . 
  * * in general , many of the monarchy symbols were absorbed and transformed during the revolution , so it 's more a matter of changing representations .

  this is the proof that europe is a good thing *, 
   when you imagine france and its scenic countryside , you might think of the picturesque villages , vineyards a plenty and endless rolling green hills to drive through on a blissful summer road trip . 
  but there 's one corner of this scenic country that no one has been allowed to enter for nearly a century , known as the `` zone rouge '' ( the red zone ) . 
    pictured above is an artist 's impression of the forsaken territory , originally covering more than 1,200 square kilometres ( 460 sq miles ) in the years following the great war . 
  today , around 100km2 ( roughly the size of paris ) , is still strictly prohibited by law from public entry and agricultural use because of an impossible amount of human remains and unexploded chemical munitions yet to be recovered from the battlefields of both world wars . 
    step inside the real `` no go-zone '' ... des tonnes de bombes enfouies , de la pollution \u00e0 l\u2019arsenic \u00e0 des niveaux hallucinants , etc. 
  * tons of buried bombs , arsenic pollution to outrageous levels , etc. 
  in france , the 1 ^ st world war continues to have consequences . 
  * grammatically , yes . 
  but there is a semantic difference between `` bad '' and `` bad '' : the first one expresses a strong fundamental principle .

  * i think we have here a casus belli . 
  the perfidious albioneses acknowledged their fault . 
  * whoa , i did n't know that . 
  few things remain in india from the french presence , so it is pleasing to see this . 
  * from the french `` pomme-frites '' . 
  * the fries are eaten as they are ( with just a pinch of salt sprinkled on them ) , or with a tip of mustard placed on the border of the plate , or with the sauce of the meat . 
   belgium blames american soldiers stationed in french-speaking wallonia during world war i for first referring to the belgian national dish as `` french fries '' . 
  * in fact , the problem exists mainly for english speakers . 
  francophones simply call them `` ( apples ( earth ) ) * frites * '' . 
  i do not think that is unesco 's role to solve the terminology problems specific to each language . 
   mayonnaise with french fries ? 
  is that good ? 
  * no , this is an heresy . 
  only people from the north of france eat them this way .

  * / r/rance is not certain on this matter .

  * naturally that cultural elements are questionable , and also the cultures as a whole . 
  but if we do n't have problems as french , we must do with the prudish anglo-saxon sensibilities .

  attention !, 
  in french , the familiar low-key way to answer this kind of question is by using a charming `` into your ass '' *,

  * hello everyone !, 
  * * indeed , we will need a bit of time to start to properly help the subreddit / r/europe : we are a lot of people , and there is always something important happening somewhere on our continent , which generates some animation .

  in two weeks we wo n't hear about it anymore . 
   on the bicentennial of the most famous battle in world history , a distinguished historian looks at what could have been  [ ... ]  if napoleon had remained emperor of france for the six years remaining in his natural life , european civilization would have benefited inestimably . 
  the reactionary holy alliance of russia , prussia and austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in spain , greece , eastern europe and elsewhere ; pressure to join france in abolishing slavery in asia , africa and the caribbean would have grown ; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated ; jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the papal states and made to wear the yellow star again ; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied ; and the plans to rebuild paris would have been implemented , making it the most gorgeous city in the world . 
    napoleon deserved to lose waterloo , and wellington to win it , but the essential point in this bicentenary year is that the epic battle did not need to be fought -- and the world would have been better off if it had n't been . 
  * mwouais , it is debatable . 
  the fall of napoleon avoided the establishment of a strong hereditary empire , which would have renewed a kind of monarchy . 
  that sounds good : less work and more time for rest *,
