  * * example : [ les sacres ( jurons qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbx9y3-9ofq ) . 
  however , the accent is really strong , and i sometimes struggle to understand . 
  * i have a fondness for the `` putain de bordel de saloperie de mes couilles de merde '' when i bump against a hard object . 
  it helps a lot to clear the burst of sharp pain , and makes it clear to others that i felt some pain .

  thundercross is related to the sun , goddess laima and thunder . 
  this sign was cut into the beds of children and woven into belts for newborns . 
  today in latvia it is used for shirts , gloves , socks , belts and other traditional clothing . 
  * paris is a big city , completely heterogeneous . 
  there is a mix of local people -- living in paris but also coming from nearby suburbs -- and international ones . 
  that 's why we systematically state the difference between paris and the rest of france ; besides there is also the oversea territories who differ . 
  everything else is just rags for degenerate hipsters . 
  ( also , do not listen to the italians : they just want to sell you their expensive fabric leftovers from last year ) * relevant : [ mode fran\u00e7aise ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=mode+fran%c3%a7aise&amp;num=100&amp;newwindow=1&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=jklzvycqfmw7ygoylodobg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1726&amp;bih=1106 ),
