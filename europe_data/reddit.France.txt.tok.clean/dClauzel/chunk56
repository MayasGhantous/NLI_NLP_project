  to assist in moderating and to animate / r/europe ? 
  this does interest [ me ] ( / u/dclauzel ) . 
  let 's see ... * * guidelines : * - * account age  1 year * - * yes ; 5 years ( and charter member ) * - * 500 + combined karma from any subreddits * - * yes ( and this without posting pictures of cats !, 
  ) * - * be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue * - * yes , easily * - * have experience as a moderator ( or similar ) * - * yes , on reddit with / r/lyon and private subreddits for work , and many francophone forums ( [ sden ] ( http://www.sden.org/forums/ ) , [ ffjdr ] ( http://forums.ffjdr.org/ ) , etc. ) . 
  i am also a teacher and a lecturer , so managing multiple ( sometimes ) agitated persons is something i do every day . 
  * * interview questions : * - * do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  * - * i occasionally set up bots ( filtering , playlists , etc ) for basics uses . 
  as a computer scientist , i naturally use css and tools that make life easier . 
  * - * what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  * - * utc + 1 ( metropolitan france ) , i am on reddit primarily during the afternoon and early evening * - * what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe * - * for me , there is not enough cultural pluralism . 
  too often we find the same informations in the same language , with the same views . 
  the bbc , the guardian , the nytimes ... even if these news sources are good , they are not varied : they are from the same socio-cultural environment . 
  there are a few discussions of articles with different editorial lines , but they are not popular and are systematically buried . 
  * - * what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  * - * to encourage multilingualism , to support the sharing of links and the establishment of discussion in other languages than english . 
  for example , i wish i could see more contents on slovenia and liechtenstein . 
  we almost never see anything about these countries on / r/europe , and i think it 's a shame . 
  * - * one could also think of recurring topics that would focus on a country or an event ( ` currently in moldova ' , ` the opening of the hunting season ' ... ) by collecting links to articles that discuss them . 
  this would avoid the proliferation of separate discussions on the same subject , and improve the visibility of the different opinions on it . 
  so , more megathreads . 
  * - * what would make you a good moderator ? 
  * - * but i already am a good moderator !, 
  * - * i 'm pretty happy with the current moderation on / r/europe : we do not see spam , propaganda is firmly held in check , discussions are polite ( but i have no problem with animated debates -- even virulent one -- as long they are constructive . 
  one can be screaming and at the same time being right ) , people do not complain elsewhere of censorship , and we do not see too many unnecessary messages with only pictures . 
  it is a balance that suits me . 
  i am used to do a flexible moderation in discussions tools that i manage : all that does not hamper proper functioning , does not pollute , and do not strongly irritates a large majority of people , is welcome . 
  so i am at ease . 
  * - * / r/europe is a subreddit that i like very much , both as a source of information and place for shuffling ideas . 
  i have been participating here for years , and i just want to contribute more to make it live . 
  * - * ^ ( and of course the presence of a french in the moderation team would be very welcome to ) [ ^ ( offset this treacherous anglo-saxon omnipresence ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdnm47h.jpg ) ^ *, 
  in the mountains , all the persons who do not live in your valley are foreigners . 
  / * in france , very well . 
  * yes , i also found it very nice !, 
  * that is why you are answering in english ? 
  il y a probablement une petite structure de cours priv\u00e9s en place quelque part \u00e0 paris , ainsi qu\u2019une ou deux universit\u00e9s litt\u00e9raires en province qui proposent cette langue en option , mais sinon ... * honestly , i could not tell where to learn estonian in france . 
  there is probably a small structure for private lessons somewhere in paris , and one or two literary universities in province offering this as optional language , but otherwise ... *, 
  * if you live in france , it is expected from you that you speak a minimal french , so you are able to interact in a daily manner with other citizens and the administrations . 
  * * in paris , we have quite a lot of american and australian expatriates who even after 20 years of living in france , with a family and everything , are unable to align 3 basic sentences because they refuse to make the effort to learn french . 
  it does irritate everyone . 
  * the case of the front de gauche is special : it is a gathering of different ( small ) political parties , sometimes running for an election under this label . 
  an important person from one of these party ( jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon ) made some remarks in favour of putin , without this being the official position of his party , nor the one of the front de gauche . 
  * for the ump ... pff , this party is a mess because it gathers different right political currents , so it is difficult to have a clear opinion . 
  but overall , the ump is not pro-putin , but not too anti-putin either ( understand : to invade crimea and ukraine is bad , but the russian-speaking ethnic preference is not a real problem ) . 
  * hey , joan of arc was patriotic , not nationalist the elle magazine wanted to storify her using a strong name , and crashed . 
  he wot m8 ? 
  esp\u00e9rons qu\u2019elle ne finisse pas comme marie stuart la catholique ( snif ) * let 's hope she does not end up like the mary stuart la catholique ( sniff ) *  `` i ca n't explain it , '' says alan cook , a labour official . 
  `` it defies all explanation . '' non non , je le rassure : il y a beaucoup d\u2019explications tr\u00e8s simples ; c\u2019est juste qu\u2019il refuse de les entendre . 
  * no no , i reassured him : there is a lot of very simple explanations ; it 's just that he refuses to hear them . 
  eh , on a une tr\u00e8s belle m\u00e9t\u00e9o pour ce d\u00e9but de mai : \u00e7a serait dommage de ne pas en profiter en \u00e9tant coinc\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler ; autant sortir dans la rue et prendre l\u2019air * well , we have a beautiful weather for this early may : it would be a shame not to enjoy it because of being stuck at work ; better going out into the streets and to appreciate the air *, 
  mais l\u00e0 , je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re plut\u00f4t regarder des anim\u00e9s et profiter de ce long weekend ( cette ann\u00e9e , en mai nous avons 4 jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s ) * if i were not worrying for europe , i would be gorging myself with popcorn . 
  but now , i rather prefer watching anim\u00e9s and enjoying this long weekend ( this year , in may we have 4 free days ) *, 
  / * even better !,

  * oh yes , i totally agree . 
  we must stop with all these exceptions : either a country fully participates in the european construction , either it is an outside spectator . 
  at one point , we must stop with the nonsenses and caprices .

  merci !, 
  * well , it 's a little more complicated than that . 
  first because , unlike the usa , europe does not consist of a single country but of many with different legislations ; and some are not even members of the european union ( crazy ) or would consider leaving ( batshit crazy ) . 
  * * then , our social systems are different again from the usa 's . 
  in the case of france , to welcome masses of the poors and unemployeds would blow our aid budgets , and actually pummel our economy . 
  there would also be the problem of cultural integration ( the `` savoir vivre ensemble '' ) , to avoid the formation of community ghettos . 
  * * as said michel rocard , `` france can not welcome all the misery of the world , but must take his portion '' ; the same applies to europe . 
  * * the author of this post is nice , but i invite him to better understand the situation of european countries before advocating nonsense . 
  * none .

  * what matters is the definitions of the french legislation on sexual assaults . 
  then , it will be the work of the justice to qualify the facts , and of the judge to interpret the law . 
  in terms of morals , the french culture is very different from the puritanical anglo-saxon culture .

   oh , you think the progressive society is your ally , but you merely adopted the socialism . 
  i was born in it , molded by it . 
  i did n't see the capitalism until i was already a man ; by then , it was nothing to me but blinding !, 
  the social services betray you , because they belong to me . 
  i will show you where i have made my home , whilst preparing to bring justice . 
  then , i will break you . 
  your precious entertainment industry , gratefully accepted . 
  we will need it . 
  ah yes , i was wondering what would break you first . 
  your religious craziness , or your banks .
