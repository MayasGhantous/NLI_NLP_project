   sixteen polish knights , armours , swords and other clubs , triumphed sunday 's opponents from the united states , winning the most prestigious race of the world championship of chivalry . 
    the final between the two teams of 16 members each s ` place in the impressive surroundings of the huge medieval malbork castle in the north of poland , former capital of the teutonic knights   tradition - certainly stronger in poland than in the us - and the thousands of encouragement viewers helping the poles won six gold , two silver and two bronze medals , occupying a place on the podium in ten competitions individual or group combat . 
  britain was second with five medals , followed by spain , quebec , the united states and denmark . 
  * obviously , medieval is not a stuff for the us but hey , / r/yurop !, 
  * * another thing i have never understood is all the folklore around the renaissance fairs . 
  the us does not have the renaissance , so why celebrate ? 
  especially they do it as a complete caricature , and with several anachronisms just for the show . 
   hellfest has enemies , it is not new . 
  including extreme fringe of catholic groups , which denounced the texts ` blaspheming ' they believe their religion . 
  but so far , only letters or petitions were circulated to denounce the holding of the largest metal festival in clisson since 2006 . 
  in 2010 however , the national confederation of catholic family associations had tried to cancel the event this year by assigning the organizers before the high court of nantes . 
    what is new , however , is that some attacked last night at the hellfest site . 
  sunday morning , the organizers discovered that much of their plantations had been torn . 
  with a threat of a container : ` j-47 , the first warning . ', 
  other tags were observed on bars such as ` vade retro satanas ' ( go away to satan ) , ` archangel michael ' ` viva christo rex , ave maria ' ( viva the king christ , hail mary ) . 
  several vend\u00e9e cross designs were also raised . 
  barbaud benjamin , head of the hellfest was appalled . 
  the organizers had not received many threats over this year , ` but we suspected that with the current climate in france , the actions would be more pronounced , ' he stated . 
    a complaint will be filed on monday by police . 
  brigadiers who were present this morning to see the damage and conduct surveys . 
  coincidence or not , a month ago the collective anti-hellfest called for public protests . 
  ) * the ultracathos fanatics have struck again . 
  we 'll see if it raises as much indignation on the part of elected and government as other degradations of communitarianism origin ... * * so , hop a panel : [ i hellfest \\ m / ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9lhuhpd.png ) ( what ? 
  there 's no reason for not doing it too !, 
  * same answer as for the crif : the jewish lobby organisations denounce an aggression but cites no external sources or provide evidence . 
  no media ( press , radio , television ) , local or national , has published about an assault by a gang of 40 people . 
  the government , which is currently in a campaign against communitarianism , did not released a communiqu\u00e9 .

  * [ discussion about this in / r/france ] ( / r/france/comments / 34lup2/une _ nouvelle_agression_raciste_en_france_seule_la / ) : for the moment ... nothing . 
  people see only that the sole source of information is deemed to be unreliable and biased . 
  * the crif is mostly a specialist when it come to broadly blame anybody , without any evidence . 
  its members and leaders are pointedly regularly condemned by the justice on this matter ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.crif.org/fr/actualites/publication-judiciaire/50568 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/koszayr/240414/le-crif-condamne-nancy-0 ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/marine-le-pen-fait-condamner-le-crif-mais-pas-bhl-08-11-2013-3298965.php ) , etc. ) . 
  attention !, 
  * careful !, 
  and the crif is a strongly biased political lobby , regularly criticized for its twisted truths and polemics . 
  hummmmmmm . 
  * hummmmmmm . 
  for now , this information appears nowhere in the main big public french press , but other various random news about 1 ^ st may manifestations have been published . 
  the only source of information is this israeli opinion webzine ; its article has been republished and commented on elsewhere . 
  before starting crazy discussions , i recommend to wait for more . 
  for example , by having confirmation of the filing of a complaint with the police , or a government 's communication . 
  donc , voil\u00e0 ... * after 72 hours , still no mention anywhere in the press of any aggression from a gang of 40 people against 2 persons identified belonging to the jewish community , and no communication from the government , police , or others . 
  so here it goes ... *, 
  * with some young nearly naked girls dancing , it would be a success at eurovision . 
  * no , we rather prefer worked phrasing , like in cyrano de bergerac .

   the european commission takes part in discussions on air pollution in france . 
  in a statement issued wednesday , april 29 the european body has threatened the authorities of a return to court if they do not take action `` ambitious , expeditious and effective '' to limit population exposure to fine particles . 
    a response should be recognized `` within two months '' , specified brussels . 
  france , for non-monitoring of this ` reasoned opinion ' , must answer before the court of justice of the european union . 
  the eu executive believes that the country `` has not adopted the measures that have been applied since 2005 to protect the health of its citizens . '', 
    ** ten highly affected areas **   the commission , based on the figures given by paris , points out that the problem of air pollution is a major concern in ten areas : `` the daily maximum limits are exceeded for these [ in ] paris , lyon , grenoble , marseille , in martinique , in the rh\u00f4ne-alpes ( arve valley ) , paca-zur [ regional urban area ] , in nice , toulon and bethune douai-valenciennes . 
  ''   the fine particles come from emissions from industry , traffic and domestic heating . 
  an episode of increased pollution in paris and the ile-de-france , in early april , had given rise to a new controversy in france , elected officials from the region demanding , unsuccessfully , rapid implementation of alternating traffic vehicles . 
  problem : they are unpopular for a portion of the population , and as the government is at its lowest in the polls ... *, 
  * if there 's one thing we learned from europe 's history , it is that war often much faster and improbably than we think . 
  * how you would feel if all the executive agencies and about the european union were in tampere ? 
  that all productions of the union - laws , decrees , declarations , official communication , general announcements , websites , press releases , conferences , interviews , meetings , etc. 
  - were in finnish only ? 
  the elected representatives were absent from their country for months so not a euro was spent in non-essential travel ? 
  * * not a pleasant situation , right ? 
  decentralization and multilingualism are not additional costs , but a fair price to pay for the european union to be built with the citizens , and not by politicians detached from the people . 
  * if european citizens are left with a europe that uses only one language that is foreign to them ( english ? 
  ) , none of the institutions is in their country , and with elected representatives they never see because being all the time in brussels , there is great risk that they feel disconnected from the european construction and they stop supporting it . 
  ( et puis , les trains , c\u2019est cool ) * ah , the eternal question ... a centralized europe in brussels and it being a little less expensive to operate , or a decentralized europe throughout the subcontinent and being closer to its citizens ? 
  * * the eu project is not economic ( regardless of what the english say ) : it is above all human . 
  the main objective of europe is to end the milleniums of wars by strongly uniting all our nations . 
  this is not a cost but a fair price to pay . 
  * * ( also , trains are cool ) *, 
  encore mieux , le sketch `` [ against the no , des guignols de l\u2019info ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syy8zlzbba8 ) '' .
