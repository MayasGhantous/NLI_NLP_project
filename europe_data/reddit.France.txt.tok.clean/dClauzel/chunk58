  decentralization and multilingualism are not additional costs , but a fair price to pay for the european union to be built with the citizens , and not by politicians detached from the people . 
  * if european citizens are left with a europe that uses only one language that is foreign to them ( english ? 
  ) , none of the institutions is in their country , and with elected representatives they never see because being all the time in brussels , there is great risk that they feel disconnected from the european construction and they stop supporting it . 
  ( et puis , les trains , c\u2019est cool ) * ah , the eternal question ... a centralized europe in brussels and it being a little less expensive to operate , or a decentralized europe throughout the subcontinent and being closer to its citizens ? 
  * * the eu project is not economic ( regardless of what the english say ) : it is above all human . 
  the main objective of europe is to end the milleniums of wars by strongly uniting all our nations . 
  this is not a cost but a fair price to pay . 
  * * ( also , trains are cool ) *, 
  `` le nouvel empire fran\u00e7ais confirm ** \u00e9 ** !!, 
  yep , merci !, 
   much to the amusement of the french . 
  * it is this point which makes the story very credible . 
  excellent !, 
  cravates , vestes , etc. 
  * it 's just an impression , or there is red all over ? 
  ties , jackets , etc. 
  co\u00efncidence ( i doubt ) or is there a particular reason ? 
   * i remember my first deputy director who , learning that i was attending classes on saturdays at the finnish cultural institute , said , eyes wide with astonishment , in the style of louis de fun\u00e8s : `` finnish !, 
  how on earth can anyone learn finnish ! '' * * [ carnets diplomatiques : the french diplomats ' blog ] ( http://blog.diplomatie.gouv.fr/ ) is a great place to understand the work of diplomacy , and more generally french diplomatic activities . 
  it is very accessible and full of interesting anecdotes . 
  naturellement , \u00e7a ne s ' est pas pass\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9vu par le gouvernement ... * even better : at the time , a few days later , during the weather forecast we were informed that the azores anticyclone would protect us from the arrival of the radioactive plume . 
  naturally , it did not happen as announced by the government ... *, 
  c\u2019est plut\u00f4t aux pays \u00e9trangers de nous dire merci : on a une grosse [ usine de traitement des d\u00e9chets radioactifs \u00e0 la hague ] ( http://www.areva.com/fr/activites-1118/areva-la-hague--recyclage-des-combustibles-uses.html ) , et on a des clients un peu partout dans le monde qui nous envoient leurs saloperies ... * it is rather to the foreign countries to thank us : we have a big [ radioactive waste treatment plant at la hague ] ( http://www.areva.com/fr/activites-1118/areva-la-hague - - recycling-of-fuel-uses . html ) , and our customers send us their crap from all over the world ... *, 
  `` [ ouaip ] ( https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/ouaip ) '' would be even better . 
   harvesting mushrooms in some parts of france has been forbidden ( i 'm not sure if it 's still true ) . 
  l\u00e0 encore , les exportations agricoles et les agriculteurs sont des sujets d\u00e9licats ... * yes , and not to eat vegetables without washing them well , and do not consume dairy products ( animals eat possibly irradiated grass ) . 
  these measures were late and were geographically and temporally limited . 
  again , agricultural exports and farmers are sensitive issues ... *, 
  * yep , `` the cloud stopped at the border , '' and has not crossed the rhine . 
  scientists and health authorities have been ordered to minimize the facts and risks . 
  * * the government was forced gradually to inform citizens more fully because the french border read other things in the foreign press . 
  30 years later , we still do not exactly who gave what orders or how . 
  * * nuclear is a very sensitive subject in france : it is our main source of energy , and a significant portion of our industrial exports . 
   although , fwiw , we are a geographical default on reddit , and the admins have put in place their own definition , which excludes turkey , and also the uk !, 
  ` fog in channel , europe cut off ' etc etc. 
  this is the best day of my life : europe is finally free of the weight that is the uk ( however , can we keep scotland ? 
  heureusement , moi je mange de base de la bonne viande de cheval : j\u2019 ai confiance en mon boucher * this is not really a `` horse meat trafficking '' , but rather a `` misrepresentation of the product '' : they were selling unfit for consumption horse meat by passing it for beef . 
  fortunately , i can eat good horse meat : i trust my butcher *, 
  * yep , but the words are logical : `` poisson '' comes from the latin `` piscis '' ( via the old french `` peis '' ) , and `` poison '' comes from the latin `` potio '' ( meaning of course `` potion '' ) . 
  the difference between the soft and hard `` s '' is importante . 
   none of those countries ( except venezuela ) have significant military force , nor the economic ability to extend their governing infrastructure if they were successful . 
  * i do not agree : france has a significant military , and not to shady economic capabilities yep , la guyane is an integral part of the french territory , not a vague annex . 
  * nothing : i give my 1 cents , 2 cents and 5 cents coins to my mother . 
  she is happy , this is small change for when she goes to the market . 
  as we say on wikipedia , `` { { reference necessary } } '' . 
  * the only really interesting area is guyane , where kourou is located , [ our european spaceport ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/centre_spatial_guyanais ) other regions plunged after decolonization , and do not seem capable of improve without significant changes . 
  aucune id\u00e9e , je suppose que \u00e7a m ' est \u00e9gal : je n\u2019ouvre pas ces sujets * no idea , i guess that i do n't mind : i do n't open those threads . 
  yes , i was shadowbanned for a couple of days . 
  some people erroneously reported me for doxxing a moderator of the french reddit 's community after i reposted his phone number . 
  him and i -- and some others too -- are classified as `` celebrities '' when it comes to reddit 's moderation ; we are posting here in our own names , have public political and artistic activities , etc , so we can not be doxxed : we are already ( very ) public . 
  it took a couple of days to reach the admins and to fix this . 
  no problem , but a bit annoying ( stupid administrative stuff is seldom welcome ) . 
  so , thanks for the welcome back party but i mean it : if you need some francophone help , i am willing to giving a hand . 
  * * it would make at least one ~ ~ french ~ ~ non-english moderator , to balance the multitude of english moderators *, 
  one would then have to drive on the left side . 
  gta is a game , not a masochism tool *, 
  * * politics say exactly the same thing whenever something happens . 
  we then learn that the intelligence services were aware of the threat or that the person was under surveillance , but they did nothing . 
  so , the government takes the opportunity to pass new security laws -- because apparently the previous ones `` did not go far enough . '' and some time after a new incident occurs , and the cycle begins again . 
  * * for over twenty years we have been living under bomb alert in france with the plan vichypirate ~ ~ [ vigipirate ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/plan_vigipirate ) ~ ~ . 
  it costs a fortune , annoys everyone , violates the fundamental principles of the constitution , and has an insignificant effect . 
  * * politics are well seen by their constituents when they reinforce security measures , as it gives the impression that something is being done . 
  but no one has the courage to lower the level because if anything happens then he will be will be accused of negligence . 
  so , it is inevitable escalation until something cracks . 
  * honestly , no . 
  i do not like this idea . 
  this would mean that european legislation extends outside its borders ; and the backfire being that foreign countries ' laws apply to their citizens in europe . 
  * * solving conflicts between laws would be tricky . 
  for example if a country explicitly authorizes an act but the european prohibited it , one would then have to follow the law of a country in which one is currently not . 
  * * for me , a european citizen should not be subject to european laws when he in a foreign country . 
  one of the objectives when going in a foreign country is pointedly to live differently . 
  * europe is at least placed under france 's control ? 
  sniff , it 's beautiful : the dream of charlemagne and napoleon is finally coming true . 
  oui , oui , on sait ... `` la france est en train de mourir '' . 
  * yes , yes , we know ... `` france is dying '' . 
  we have been hearing this tune for the last 30 years . 
  well , it 's true that the economic situation is not at its best , but we are far from falling into the third world . 
  * i do not have an idea . 
  i am very glad to see a new serious newspaper to cover european news . 
  i like the editorial line in the articles i read . 
  now , regarding the impact on other media outlets ... pfff !, 
  * super ... 
  it 's sure than attacking the whistleblowers rather than to protect them will greatly help to fight large-scale fraud in europe . 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  * yes , the new one is better , but not exactly extraordinary . 
  * a smile could kill them . 
  that said , when i am working with finnish computer scientists , they are much more friendly than what people say . 
  also , i must also say that after living several months in lyon , they were much more likely to laugh in public . 
  * * from experience , i 've also noticed that the japanese also have some trouble getting to the latin side of life in france . 
  but for them , the culture shock is far more important . 
  * eh , it 's strange to see the mediterranean sea on the side . 
  however , the projection is tricky : it vertically stretches the lands . 
  * if the independent scotland joins the european union , yes . 
  l\u00e0 , ils ont mis la cocarde de la [ raf ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_air_force ) . 
  je ne peux que noter qu\u2019une fois de plus que ce sont les anglais qui mettent le bazar en europe * there is a huge mistake for france : the [ cocarde tricolore ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/cocarde_tricolore ) has the blue in the middle , not outside !, 
  the colours are listed from the center outward . 
  here , they put the cocarde of the [ raf ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_air_force ) . 
  * * i can only note that , once again , it is the english who brings the mess in europe *, 
  * ok , but ... what about the content ?
