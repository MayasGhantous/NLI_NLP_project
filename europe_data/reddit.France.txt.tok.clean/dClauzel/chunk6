  * yes , i agree . 
  so my main question is : what kind of french p\u00e2t\u00e9 was it ? 
  c\u2019est en train de changer , mais c\u2019est loin d\u2019\u00eatre gagn\u00e9 : / * driving schools are a regulated market , with lobbies furiously protecting their incomes by blocking the concurrence . 
  it is changing , but it is far from being done : / *, 
  :d * lucky for us that we have some `` sovereign clouds '' protected by the new arbitrary laws of the european commission , otherwise what would it be ? 
  fearrrrrrr us , putin !, 
  english bowmen indeed had their fingers cut :p otherwise , your french is readable enough , without being good . 
   thanks for speaking another language on r/europe . 
  i 'm kind of bored with only reading english . 
  * there are quite a lot of people here who furiously downvote everything that is not in english . 
  plainly boring , and stupid : europe is founded on multilingusim . 
  yup . 
  and even today the english remember what happen when they dare to use their longbows on french land : they lost their finger :d, 
  * no idea this existed . 
  we do n't talk about it , in france , and we celebrate it even less . 
  p\u00e9tain ? 
  bof . 
  i do n't see any immediate french historical figure that we could obviously hate . 
  stupid politicians , dumb kings , serial murderers , fanatical priests , or whatever , we had our fair share . 
  but * hated * ? 
  no , i do n't see . 
  * * ( except maybe those who did burned jeanne d\u2019arc , but they were english , so ... :p ) *, 
  ben tiens ... * so there is a problem with the so-called right to be forgotten , says the european commission ? 
  then we need do to further and stronger . 
  under the cover of citizen and data protection , the commission ask for stricter laws and extended powers for controlling published informations . 
  yeah ... *, 
  [ same data with a pretty boring graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/miiwcv2.png ), 
   in paris you can definitely live car free . 
  same in [ lyon ] ( / r/lyon ) . 
  in all french cities , you can live car-free without problem : public transports , shopping deliveries , intercity trains , etc. 
  as a french , i disagree : la mayonnaise is better served on a plate , with raw vegetables , or eggs . 
  well , he can only do better than barroso , so yes . 
   yougov is pretty well trusted international research firm part of the british polling council mwouais . 
  in france we have also `` well trusted international '' polling companies ( ipsos , ifop , sofres , bva , etc ) members of whatever , and they are frequently involved in political scandals and biasses . 
  so ... bof . 
  french here : it is quite the opposite , in fact . 
  people are demanding more stronger sanctions against russia . 
  you can read it in the newspapers , hear it in the streets , feel it in the parliament sessions . 
  the government is reluctant because it would have to break a few big contracts with russia ( mainly military ones ) . 
  food producers are a bit worried because russia is a non-negligible export market for them , but they are planning/hoping to compensate at the european level . 
  it is the fist time that i see this poll agency , so i do n't know how ~ ~ trustworthy ~ ~ serious it is . 
  now , let 's do the same for / r/yurop , 
  bof . 
  il suffit de lire les [ anciennes interviews ] ( http://www.enquete-debat.fr/archives/jean-du-verdier-la-justification-de-l%e2%80%99immigration-pour-des-raisons-economiques-ne-tient-pas-la-route-87342 ) qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es pour voir comment se situe ce monsieur . 
  * short translation : the author is a nationalist , with very conservative ideas on family , sovereignty , etc. 
  nothing here to see , move along .

  :d * more important , google only applies the so-called right to be forgotten to the search tools for web , images , and news ; not on google code , scholar , groups , etc. 
  guess what is coming next ... ? 
  :d * here is the [ full document ] ( https://docs.google.com/a/clauzel.eu/file/d/0b8syaai6ssfit0ewrufyoenqr3m/view?sle=true ) with all google 's answers . 
  hubic in ** not ** a good idea : it belongs to a french company ( ovh ) , and its datacenters are in france . 
  the french government has passed several harmful laws for the internet during de last years , including data snooping , mandatory data collection , liability for the technical operators , etc. 
  source : i am a french informatician . 
  if the us laws can be applied in europe , then the european laws can be applied in the usa . 
  pop-corn for everybody !, 
  we are going to have soooo much fun watching that, 
   i know i 'm the ignorant englishman who does n't speak anything else , but having posts in other languages will exclude anyone who does n't speak them . 
  and having only english excludes all the europeans not able -- or willing -- to speak in this language . 
  multilingualism is a foundation of the european union . 
  when you move only just a bit in europe , or work with people outside your local community , you realise that english is not even a fallback language .

  * la marseillaise * is badass as hell , preferably sung loudly in the face of a [ perfidious albiones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfidious_albion ) . 
  an anthem about flowers , the sun in the forest , and the beauty of the flowers ? 
  not for us : we prefer [ to call for an impure blood to water our furrows ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marseillaise#lyrics ) . 
  * good . 
  now can we also have multilingualism without the systematic downvoting , please ? 
  the french colloquialism for the corner shop is * l'arabe du coin * . 
  so ... ( see [ hassan c\u00e9hef , c'est possible !,

   at this point , the israeli economy is probably stronger than the french economy . 
  mwouarf , nice try . 
  * trop gros , passera pas * :d  similar gdp per capita with much higher annual growth rates . 
  gdp per capita is meaningless . 
  especially when no countries are counting it the same way . 
  also , what about trade volumes local to the area , demographic evolution ( the real strength of a country ) , or even long term infrastructures ? 
  english roller coasters are not very fun to ride ; they are a bit like the girls in the clubs : promising a lot , but delivering poorly . 
  they are too short , and way to low .

  just let me call the scots , so we can activate the [ auld alliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auld_alliance ) once again ... 
  so you would become ... the usa ?

  nop . 
  what i am saying is that it is a problem create by the european union , but that the companies having to apply it do it without supervision . 
  google has full liberty to accept or decline the removal requests ; there is no transparency in the decision process , and no way to contest an abusive removal ( or even to verify if they are none ) . 
  it is therefore an arbitrary private censure , without control . 
  and that is just the beginning . 
  it is not like the informaticians they did n't forewarned of the abuses . 
  the so-called `` right to be forgotten '' is mostly a craze from politics who wish to bury their mistakes , and from the paranoid luddites . 
  the end result is an arbitrary censure of the european press and people by foreign companies , without any transparency , oversee or control . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  glorious . 
  do n't worry , cop\u00e9 is going to burst in flames for * l'affaire bygmalion * . 
  this is a good summer for us . 
  first , our team is doing great in the football worldcup ( and england was lame . 
  good game , guys ) . 
  and now sarkozy is in custody , and very probably later in jail .
