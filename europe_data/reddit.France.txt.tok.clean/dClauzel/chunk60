  * the ukrainians want a maginot line ? 
  we can sell them one : new , never been used . 
  well , except that the interior needs to be redone because it begins to have a few years under the hood . 
  * * otherwise , a trenched war sucks : one is knee-deep in the mud when it rains , in winter one freezes , the deads pile up at the bottom because it is too difficult to evacuate them , the mustard gas goes down into the trenches and stagnates ... better a good front charge rather than to get stuck at the bottom of a hole . 
  * not so fast : the front national was already on this political line before . 
  the fn is defending a sovereignist vision in europe , where the states are in a strong position in the eu , and remains extremely sovereign . 
  to present the territorial affiliation of ukraine by advancing historical and ethnic arguments is quite normal for the fn . 
  it is wrong to speak of `` the purchase of a support '' .

  for what i have see during the time i spent there , the cost of life and the development are a mixed thing : the food is very cheap , technological equipments ( computer , tv , etc. ), 
  are almost the same price as in france , rents are affordable , public transport are not too expensive but also pretty bad , infrastructures are generally a bit out of date except for those which are ultra-new , internet access is very good when it is available , etc.
