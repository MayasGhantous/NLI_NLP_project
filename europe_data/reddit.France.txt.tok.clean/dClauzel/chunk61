  * yes : the father ( jean-marie ) , the daughter ( marine ) , and the granddaughter ( marion ) . 
  et si vous savez o\u00f9 regarder , vous pourrez m\u00eame apercevoir la statue de la libert\u00e9 * and if you know where to look , you can even see the liberty statue *, 
   eiffel tower was banned due to being ~ ~ overpowered ~ ~ too awesome to handle by other jealous countries . 
  ftfy, 
  * bof , no more than usual . 
  we are use to it for more than 20 years , the citizens know how to handle it . 
  mais quels connards !, 
  * what assholes !, 
  they could not instead send troops to ukraine or mali , rather than again going to fuck the shit up at the other end of the world ? 
  * employment is not the only important matter in a country , there is also investment in infrastructures ( roads , bridges , railways ) , education ( nurseries , schools , teachers , universities ) , health ( hospitals , doctors , obesity , diabetes , additives in food ) , public transport ( trains , buses ) , the environment ( wastewater treatment , waste recycling , clean air ) , social ( aid for aged and distressed people ) , etc. 
  * * the uk is below france on many of these points ; the situation of a country does not only depend on its economy , far from it . 
  but i guess it 's easier to hide poor performance by making comparisons to the current problems that its neighbours are facing . 
  one rule to rule them all , one rule to find them , one rule to bring them all and in the joy bind them in the land of europe where the diversity lie . 
  * oh , wait ... * * or we could just ask to get our money back . 
  * oh , attend ... 
  pour le reste , \u00e7a d\u00e9pendra de notre prochain pr\u00e9sident ... * the deficit was good a few years ago , but after nicolas sarkozy came to power , it completely exploded . 
  now , we still need a couple more years to fix it . 
  after that , it will depend on our next pr\u00e9sident ... *, 
  i protest : the english are generally much fatter than us *, 
  * as the author says , it may be well when doing poetry , but it is not practical for specific uses such as science . 
  personally , i clearly see the difference with the french when i have to publish in english : i systematically need to clarify ambiguities because the meaning of the pronouns is completely fuzzy . 
  * tl ; dr : english sucks because it has messy origins , it is unpredictable , and more generally an unspeakable mess . 
   it was almost like they wanted england to win by just enough . 
  impossible !, 
  * i have completely the same opinion . 
  * the same thing happened in many cities of france . 
  it is amusing to see the names of places in cities that commemorate the lib\u00e9ration : the dates change , because the liberation front was moving every day . 
  marrant , ce mot n\u2019existe pas en fran\u00e7ais * funny , this word does not exist in french *, 
  * no , the commercial areas are areas on the outskirts of cities , where are located the big shops impossible to have in the city . 
   * the sages ruled friday that the vaccination of children , imposed in france for three vaccines ( diphtheria , tetanus , and polio ) conforms `` to the constitutional requirement of health protection . '' * * no surprise here , and that 's good thing . 
  * if it is not mandatory , few corporates will make the financial effort to do these little profitable investments . 
  in terms of environmental protection , laisser-faire is not a good policy . 
   a few hundred kilometres further south , the nigerien town of arlit hosts a multi-billion french investment in uranium production , targeted by jihadist groups two years ago . 
  non , nous on veut juste s\u00e9curiser notre uranium * fighting for democracy \u00ae \u2122 \u00a9 ? 
  getting oil ? 
  no , we just want to secure our uranium *, 
  * only for buildings in commercial areas ( supermarkets , warehouses , etc. 
  ) , and therefore no individual dwellings ; no kidding here . 
  * malta and luxembourg ; and if monaco was a member of the european union , i would have added to the list . 
  * * these are all small countries that exist for historical reasons ( it was less complicated to let them be than to absorb them ) . 
  they survive only thanks to some very generous tax laws , to the detriment of the other countries of the european union . 
  merci, 
  * some diversities !, 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  * i propose to dispatch the leclerc tanks in england by the tunnel , in order to free this linguistically and culturally oppressed population . 
  * this is a lot of diversities that a single plane can push down the throat of a liberal capitalist enemy . 
  alors , voyons voir : `` as a romani myself '' , `` i 've never been to europe or even met any european romani '' , `` so i have no idea as to the veracity of these stories and claims '' . 
  * so let 's see , `` as a romani myself '' , `` i 've never been to europe or even met any european romani '' , `` so i have no idea as to the veracity of these stories and claims '' . 
  how to say ... are you sure you are rom ? 
  reading you , i rather feel that you are american and you are looking for external origins . 
  je peux t ' assurer que je n\u2019ai pas un point de vue anglais sur l\u2019europe * i can assure you that i do not have an anglocentric points of view on europe *, 
  / r/french ; de rien * / r/french ; you 're welcome *, 
  ils sont juste jaloux du swag parisien * they are just jealous of the parisian swag *, 
  * the slap is like a nuclear weapon : it is not in use , but we know that if necessary it can be used . 
  * * children are not adults , and parents are not friends . 
  discussion and explanation are always preferred , but in the end the child should accept the rules that shape his life and define its place in the society . 
  to allow him complete freedom , without control , is not doing him a favor : it will make him a badly educated adult , unpleasant for others . 
  * * so yes , sometimes a slap is required . 
  and when you look at the french population , we see that this approach succeed quite well . 
  ( par contre , \u00e7a serait vraiment tr\u00e8s dr\u00f4le ) * a kickstarter to fund the scandinavian conspiracy and to remove netanyahu from power ? 
  i 'm sure it would work ; and perhaps this is what is the most terrifying . 
  ( however , it would be really funny ) *, 
  * they are looking for no-go zones , maybe ? 
  * macro in res . 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  hair are what separate the men from the big boys *, 
  * this is because we do not trust the cows : every year , they kill more people than sharks . 
  regarde sur wikip\u00e9dia : [ projection cartographique ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/projection_cartographique ) . 
  on trouve le plus couramment les projections de [ mercator ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/projection_de_mercator ) et de [ peters ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/projection_de_peters ) . 
  * look on wikip\u00e9dia : [ map projection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/map_projection ) . 
  the most commonly found are the mercator and peters projections . 
  pffffff . 
  [ la projection de mercator ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/projection_de_mercator ) n\u2019est pas un mensonge . 
  * pffffff . 
  [ the mercator projection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercator_projection ) is not a lie . 
  this is just one of the existing projections ; each has its advantages and defaults . 
  merci . 
  on peut avoir des explications sur les notes de la carte ? 
  * thank you . 
  i confess i do not know at all portugal , except for a few rare cultural stereotypes and historical events . 
  so 3/4 of thoses references pass me over the head . 
  can we have an explanation of the notes of the map ? 
  * no , definitely not . 
  in fact , here we do n't have any problem with men hair ( symbol of virility ) . 
  no , just no . 
  fleur pellerin is a terrible minister of culture , she pointedly protects the cash flow of the right holders at the expense of the digital innovation and the evolution of society . 
  she can say what she wants about the french language , but she has neither legitimacy nor power of decision . 
  * idiot does not target the person , but the map . 
  and it is not really an insult . 
  idiot . 
  * brittany with a real desire for independence ? 
  idiot . 
  encore un triomphe ( militaire ) pour la france  * the french won without a fight : to avoid a ministerial vote that could be bloody , belgians withdrew their proposed of a 2 $ coin to celebrate the 200 ^ ( th ) anniversary of the battle of waterloo . 
  the british will have to eat their hats !, 
  * * another triumph for the french ( military ) * [ relevant ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d7roy2z.png ), 
  * a lot of errors in this map . 
  tl ; pt ( trop long ; pas traduit ) / * ( too long ; did n't translate ) : a baguette tradition is strictly defined for its ingredients and its baking process . 
  * the recipe for french bread is in the public domain .
