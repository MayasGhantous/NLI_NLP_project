  ` the marvelous adventures of captain corcoran ' was first published in 1867 and admired by the likes of sartre and zola . 
  it 's been translated into almost every european language , except for english ( due to its anti-british content ) . 
  until now . 
    translated by the acclaimed writer sam miller , captain corcoran is not just a forgotten classic but a roller coaster ride through 19th century india . 
  it 's the best adventure story you will read all year . 
  we ca n't wait to publish it .
