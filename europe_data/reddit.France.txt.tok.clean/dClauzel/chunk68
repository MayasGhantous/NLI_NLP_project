   trade disputes , endless plenary sessions with speeches in many languages , the breaking apart of longstanding alliances and coalitions -- we must be talking about the european union , right ? 
    wrong !, 
  we 're talking about the `` star wars '' galaxy , which may be far , far away but when it comes to political dialogue sounds an awful lot like brussels .

  en france , les gens votent tard dans la journ\u00e9e * here , the participation was ~ 46 % at 17h00 . 
  in france , people vote late in the day *, 
  * voted . 
  at the vote office 243 in villeurbanne , a participation of 24 % at 15h00 . 
  * * having slacked for a while in my underwear , i absorbed enough coffee to have the motivation to put on some clothes ( you can vote naked , but the president of the polling station can eject anyone undermining the proper functioning of his office ... ) and walked 100 meters to reach my polling station . 
  i was in a terse mood because again no one wanted to buy my voice ( the best offer i received was `` a beer '' but it was not confirmed ; the other being a tls certificate from let 's encrypt ) . 
  * * as a good french , i naturally voted * against * some candidates , as the option of voting * for * a candidate was complicated . 
  of course , i did not made a useful vote , let 's not going crazy here . 
  i therefore voted against the supporters of the safety delirium , the participants in characterised shenanigans , the fanatics of xenophobia , the eurosceptic , the anticapitalists , and in general manner against the candidates with the most stupid ideas . 
  * * however , in the second round , i strongly feel that i will vote blank because finding who to vote for ... pfff . 
  yep , c\u2019est pour \u00e7a que dickbutt nous laisse indiff\u00e9rent : on a mieux depuis des si\u00e8cles * yep , that 's why dickbutt leaves us indifferent : we have had better for centuries *, 
  * as long as you do not have to learn it , because there are a lot of periods which are * very * stuffed with * plenty * of dates , places , people , etc. 
   when we saw that stanford had uploaded a massive collection of images and propaganda from the french revolution , we thought that a reminder of the strength and revolutionary spirit of the french was in need . 
  this revolution inspired the world , and although the oligarchies have rebuilt themselves under the guise of capitalism and the military industrial complex , we need to remember that revolution is always possible . 
  power is not a given for any human being ; monarchs like marie antoinette considered themselves gods on earth , but in fact they were just people whose power was supported by the masses underneath them . 
  when those masses moved , they toppled their gods . 
  for the late 1700s , there is some pretty dirty shit in here too -- like porny satires of marie antoinette and her various suitors/generals/nobility getting it on while the rest of france suffered .
