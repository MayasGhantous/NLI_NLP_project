   * terrorism effects *   * the effects of a terrorist attack are of two types ; direct and indirect . 
  direct effects are the victims , destruction caused by terrorists . 
  these direct effects are quite limited , especially when compared to other types of risk . 
  even the september 11 attacks caused the us dead less than a month of road deaths . 
  the record number of 148 victims in france in 2015 is equivalent to the average number of people struck by lightning each year in france ; it is extremely low compared to the number of people who commit suicide each year in our country - about 10,000 - and deaths caused by automobiles - about 3,000 per year . 
  losing a loved one in a terrorist attack is a tragedy , but to see one suicide is it less traumatic ?

  * short story : two rounds election , so almost no chance of having the fn at the head of a region .

   * the attacks in january have revived the question of the place of religion in france .

  how to live his religion in a secular country ? 
  the importance of taking this debate is all the more paradoxical that the majority of french now feel far from any religious affiliation .
