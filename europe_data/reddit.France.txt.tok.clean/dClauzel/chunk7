  excellente nouvelle !, 
  * excellent news !, 
  the european gps keeps progressing * . 
  this is a fine way to say that the uk has its economy at the level of greece . 
  as a french , i can only applause, 
  nop , scotland is pretty fine . 
  -- your french buddies, 
   crema catalana oh , you mean * [ la cr\u00eame br\u00fbl\u00e9e ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/cr%c3%a8me_br%c3%bbl%c3%a9e ) * ? 
  :p nice choice , pretty popular here . 
  yes : so much food , and so many tourists . 
  the possible combinations are infinite . 
  in doubt , i would say [ kouign-amann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kouign-amann ) and [ tartiflette ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tartiflette ) ( and watch people scream about cholesterol ), 
  `` * by telegraph staff * '' ? 
  if you count the strikes in france , yes , i agree, 
  france 48 ^ th , being behind the uae ? 
  even at the eurovision we did better , and we had twin twin !, 
  sad . 
  yes indeed , france is not fully a presidential regime ; the president has a lot of power , but the parliament can castrated the government ( which is an extension of the president seat , given the rules defining it ) . 
  at the end , the president can ( freely ) act , and the parliament has the power to react in response to ensure control . 
  do you have example where the president of the usa would have way much more extended power than the french one ? 
  i fail to find one by just reading both constitutions . 
  the * pr\u00e9sident * has also `` minor '' authoritative powers , such as decreeing * l'\u00e9tat d'urgence * that allows to set up * couvre-feu * , censure of the press , etc. 
  this regime is very convenient when there are `` things to be done '' and that you have a competent government ; but when the leadership is weak or inefficient the whole country is stuck in the mud , because the parliament can not easily act on its own . 
  to be fair , our current constitution ( the 5 ^ th ) was written for fixing the political instability after the second world war , and to give the government the means to solve the war in algeria . 
  it is a constitution for a time of crisis , for a powerful presidential leadership . 
  the people asked de gaulle to come back , and gave him a kind of political * carte-blanche * . 
  the constitution has then never been tune down . 
  that is why france has a presidential regime , with a very powerful government . 
  the * pr\u00e9sident de la r\u00e9publique * has a lot of possibilities to do things , with only validation and control afterward by * le parlement * . 
  that include starting wars , direct diplomatic negotiations , etc. 
  when we look at other countries , we are often surprised to see that their leaders are unable to act on their own . 
  for example , the american president is very limited by the congress in a way that the french president is not . 
  it can makes international discussions difficult , because both same jobs do n't have the same power to decide and act . 
  france , proudly providing quality * r\u00e9volutions * to europe -- and the world -- since 1789 . 
  note : we are obviously closed on monday ( i mean , we are ** really ** closed : today was * [ le lundi de pentec\u00f4te ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/lundi_de_pentec%c3%b4te#caract.c3.a8re_f.c3.a9ri.c3.a9 ) * ), 
  compare the north and the south . 
  those terrorists are clearly dangerous : they could reveal some dirty secret of the uk 's government . 
  it is a wonder that they have not already been executed . 
  you know ... for freedom and such . 
  ( note to help the us secret service : this message contains irony ), 
  * nothing to see , move along * . 
  [ eurocorps ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurocorps ) is indeed a first step in the right direction for an european army . 
  for the moment it is only a joint venture of several countries , not even attached to the european union , but that could be changed . 
  the main problem is for the countries to accept to relinquish some of their military powers . 
  meaning moving from being sovereign countries to a sovereign union of countries . 
  politically , it is complex because of nationalism , will of autonomy , etc. 
  it also require to accept that some of the national soldiers , detached to the european corps , can be send to enforce decisions that the government is not agreeing to . 
  but without a common european army , europe is forced to remain unable to show strength , because no single country is willing to spend much into its military budget . 
  nothing better for bringing fear to your enemies than a human tide of naked warriors swinging their gigantic swords . 
  la force molle en action . 
  we are still waiting for * l'europe de la d\u00e9fense * . 
  first american missiles in europe , then fighters and bombers ... looks like those military bases are going to stay for 50 years . 
  the politics talk about * ind\u00e9pendance * and * souverainet\u00e9 * . 
  but the soft power only works when you can back it up with good old hard power . 
  and as we do n't have an european army ... 
  lyon is the second city in france . 
  you can not expect it to be in the countryside * le grand lyon * is quite a nice place . 
  i encourage you not to stick to a single area that did not appeal to you . 
  check google street view , and explore . 
  yes , there are plenty of them on [ arte ] ( http://www.arte.tv/ ) . 
  a lot of water to rehydrate the body , with a pinch of salt . 
  a bit of complex carbohydrates ( rice , pasta , bread ) , and some paracetamol . 
  well , you know ... saint patrick is strong there, 
  yep . 
  * la r\u00e9volution * did a lot to keep the church out of the french daily life . 
  in fact , event the priests insist of the secular nature of our society ( except for a few nuts who insist on things like the `` special '' character of the `` traditional family '' , and so ) . 
  not surprising . 
  under contract private religious schools are religious schools which follow the mandatory school program ( like all schools , under contract or not ) , but with optional religious courses . 
  certainly [ not here in ** france ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la%c3%afcit%c3%a9 ) !, 
  well , except for * le [ concordat en alsace-moselle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concordat_in_alsace-moselle ) * , for historical reasons . 
  and ~ ~ food ~ ~ red wine , too , which is very good for the heart . 
  given the number of french people complaining about the choice of twin twin , that is not surprising . 
  twin twin is completely unknown in france , and there has n't been any support for them except for politics and mainstream medias close to to the government . 
  obviously , we finished last ; and this for the first time in history . 
  sometimes , i feel like our * exception culturelle fran\u00e7aise * is to exceptional ... 
  there are several slightly different versions of the lyrics ( depending of arno 's mood ) , but ... yes , they can surprise some people another song about europe is [ l'europe , from noir d\u00e9sir et brigitte fontaine ] ( http://youtu.be/ind9u6l2lt0 ) les sangliers sont lach\u00e9s je r\u00e9p\u00e8te : les sangliers sont lach\u00e9s . 
  les noces de sang incendient l\u2019horizon . 
  nous travaillons actuellement pour l\u2019europe ... do n't try to automatically translate the lyrics . 
  the joke is that only [ bertrand cantat ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bertrand_cantat] can understand lyrics written by bertrand cantat ( but they are so great !, 
  ) , and [ brigitte fontaine ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/brigitte_fontaine ) is ... well ... brigitte fontaine . 
  i do n't know what other songs also exist about europe . 
  place a block of wood on the rfid chip in order not to leave marks on the card 's plastic , then apply a nice hammer blow . 
  it will crush the fragile extra thin circuits of the antenna . 
  you will have a mute-deaf card without damaging anything , and be able to claim innocence :d, 
  europe : love it , or leave it . 
  it is not like the uk is really part of the european union , anyway ... 
  well , for a start you are missing everything that is produce by the members of [ la francophonie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francophonie ) , 
  the [ estonian id card ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/eesti_id-kaart ) does n't have rfid support . 
  the next generation could have one ; i am not sure , i am not following its development . 
  estonie has been using digital id cards for years , and there have n't been any serious security problem . 
  * in france , we have the need for a global administrative card , which would gather the id card , the voting card , the driving licence , the social security card , etc. 
  there are some serious oppositions but the work is progressing anyway . 
  * * at the european level , the difficulty would not be read the data from the card , but to use them : it is a matter of interoperability between the various national systems . 
  this card would be more likely a simple authentication link than a way to carry working data . 
  france is currently working on a similar project , it does perfectly make sense to have this kind of work done at the european level . 
  that would ensure a full compatibly from the start , and a broader adoption . 
  i do n't remember anything about this . 
  do you have any articles on it ? 
  but that surprises men because there are only a limited number of brands that have been allowed to sell this vaccine in france . 
  and like any other vaccine , you are free to choose the one you want in a pharmacie .
