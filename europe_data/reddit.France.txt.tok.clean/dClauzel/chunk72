  * the good news is that the cats -- posix and alsa -- finally integrated the time change to winter clock , and thus the change of time for the meals , hugs , wakening , etc. 
  * * the bad news is that i was woken up at 7h40 by the phone . 
  a friend uses his phone as an alarm clock , and slapped it trying to stop it ; he dialed my number by mistake . 
  * * but it does not matter anyway as i was already naturally awake at 7h05 because of a growing belly pain . 
  i hesitated 5 minutes to decide if it was the intestines that had taken cold or if it was the right kidney . 
  as the pain increased and i also had a point of pain on the right flank , i swallowed some k\u00e9toprof\u00e8ne and tramadol . 
  and 15 minutes later some tramadol again because the pain continued to grow and i knew it would be * bad * if i do not blocked it quickly . 
  * * it is now 12h55 and it 's going very well . 
  a bit more than another week and i 'm doing the new urine check , and with the support of my endocrine-nutritionist , i will force my general doctor to direct me to a surgical solution . 
  because , three months with anti-inflammatory and a visit to the hospital , it 's way too much . 
  pas du tout : on est les premiers * not at all : we are the leader *,
