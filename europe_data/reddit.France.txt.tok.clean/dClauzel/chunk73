  *   eu ambassador to israel lars faaborg-andersen was summoned to the foreign ministry in jerusalem to be reprimanded over the decision . 
    the european commission adopted wednesday morning the notice on indication of origin of goods from the territories occupied by israel since june 1967 , a senior eu official said . 
  according to the official , the notice will contain guidelines for labeling of products from west bank settlements . 
   following the decision , eu ambassador to israel lars faaborg-andersen was summoned to the foreign ministry in jerusalem to be reprimanded on wednesday evening . 
    the israeli foreign ministry said in response that the european union `` chooses , for political motives , to take an unusual and discriminatory step '' at a time when israel is facing a wave of terror . 
  in a statement , the ministry said it was `` surprised and even angered by the fact that the eu chooses to implement a double standard against israel , while ignoring 200 territorial disputes taking place today around the world , including within [ the eu ] or right on [ israel 's ] doorstep . '', 
  the claim that the decision is a technical step , added the statement , `` is a baseless cynical claim . '', 
    `` labeling products will not advance peace talks between israel and the palestinians , '' the ministry continued . 
  `` on the contrary , it may only bolster the palestinian authority 's refusal to hold direct negotiations with israel -- negotiations which the eu says it supports . '', 
  the decision to label products , the statement went on , `` will strengthen the radical elements who are pushing for boycotts against israel and who deny its right to exist , positions which the eu claims it objects to . 
  the latest move raises questions over the role the eu wishes to play , and may have consequences on relations between israel and the eu . '', 
    the decision adopted wednesday is a result of three years of administrative work and discussion at the european union institutions . 
  during this time , the eu has repeatedly warned israel over possible consequences of continued construction in the settlements . 
    in recent months , collection of information about the guidelines has been a top priority at the israeli embassies in the 28 countries of the eu . 
  but despite the major effort to learn what the label guidelines will provide , virtually no relevant information has been obtained . 
  that , senior officials in jerusalem have said , is because of the meticulous manner in which work on the document has been keep out of reach of those who have not needed access to its content .
