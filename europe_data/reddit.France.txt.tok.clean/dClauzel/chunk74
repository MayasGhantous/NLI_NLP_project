    * ten years of systematic obstruction by luxembourg , the netherlands and belgium , to the attempts desired by the eu to reform the '' harmful ' tax systems benefiting the multinationals . 
  this is what le monde discovered after having had access to hundreds of pages of confidential documents , from several working groups in brussels on taxation involving senior officials of states members of the union ( including the group called ` code de conduite ' ) and from which elected officials of the special ` tax ' committee of the european parliament have had only partial access - and again , after much battling . 
  some of these texts were accessible only in secure parts of the european commission .

  * broken english best english !, 
  * france ? 
  nobody cares \u2b50 *  the european union 's proactive stance on languages sets the global standard and is a source of inspiration for the teaching of foreign languages in general , and english in particular . 
  marrant comment ils parlent de plurilinguisme , de langages multiples , etc tout en sous-entendant qu\u2019une seule langue importe via une interpr\u00e9tation cr\u00e9ative des d\u00e9clarations de l\u2019union europ\u00e9enne ... * funny how they talk about multilingualism , multiple languages , etc. 
  while implying only one language matter through a creative interpretation of the statements from the european union ... *,

   * according to the local memory , there is no recollection of a cheese flight of this magnitude for at least twenty years ... the burglary was done in the monday to sunday night , targeting a hundred of comt\u00e9 wheels , almost four tons in total !, 
  the damage is measured in ten thousand euros . 
  * send the gign !, 
  activate the crisis plans !, 
  it is an attack on our meal plate !, 
  thanks a lot for this time . 
  it was great !, 
  * where is the secret bar in the parliament 's buildings in strasbourg , and how to get key ? 
  * not before 2050 . it is a massive fundamental work on a long time scale .

  * france has just undertaken a simplification of its regional map , reducing the number of regions . 
  this has also been the source of much discussion on the role of regions in france and europe . 
  * * in france , we head towards a development around major thematic cities , which would in turn drive the development of the territories . 
  * * what is the current trend in europe ? 
  is the european union piloting projects for regional transition or reorganisation ? 
  what would be desirable to improve at the region level in europe ? 
  iter is great . 
  it is not just a attempt for creating endless cheap and safe energy , but also a framework for incorporating a lot of various researches into a single working result . 
  think of iter as the cern for energy : the goal is not simply to create something , but to make things come together and to identify possible side useful results ( new supraconductors , new heat dispersion management , etc ) . 
  at the very least for science and engineering , we * really * need iter : there are plenty of works that can only be done on a giant scale . 
  but the energy production would also be very great, 
  avec en suspend la question de l\u2019appartenance de l\u2019uk \u00e0 l\u2019union europ\u00e9enne , comment l\u2019uk approche-t ' elle les n\u00e9gociations de la cop21 o\u00f9 l\u2019europe s ' engage fortement ? 
  * with the unanswered question of the uk membership in the european union , how does the uk approaches the negotiations at cop21 , in which europe is strongly committed ? 
  / * what size are you , and if you are above or below the mean , how do you live ? 
  * i am 1.79 m , i 'm well above the national average , but in the normal range of `` big '' . 
  * * i think it is a good size . 
  it has the advantages of being great , provided it becomes annoying . 
  * * easy access to the top shelves in supermarkets and upper cupboards . 
  by standing on tiptoe one can see above a crowd . 
  you can carry big stuff without struggling not to have it dragging on the ground . 
  * * at the same time we do n't have to lower our head constantly to through the doors . 
  girls can easily spontaneously kiss you , which is not the case if you are to tall . 
  we have no joint pain . 
  it correctly puts his legs by plane and train , etc. 
  * * by cons , in the range of 1.80 m we have the usual problems of interior design . 
  all furnitures and equipments are too low . 
  the kitchen sink is too low to properly do the dishes , so we must bend our back to reach the bottom and it hurts . 
  same for the cutting table , and the various work plans ( but you can easily piss in the bathroom sink ) . 
  ditto for the vacuum cleaner and brooms : the handle is too short , so we quickly tire out and we hurt because of bad posture . 
  * * large chains of furniture ( like ikea ) are beginning to take into account this size factor for people , offering furniture and appliances with adjustable height . 
  the old size standards were intended for women of ~ 1.60 m , and so when one is a man of 1.80 m it changes a lot of things in ergonomics . 
  kitchens and appliances were actually designed in the 50 's to be used by women , who are smaller and less strong than men ; it is also one of the reasons that make us guys reluctant to household chores : the sizes are not suitable so we break our back very quickly . 
  * * the gender equality unquestionably goes with higher bottom for kitchen sinks , and with longer handles for vacuum cleaners . 
  it 's simple , but it really is essential . 
  * robespierre was not violent .
