   [ maximilien robespierre ] ( http://cdn.playbuzz.com/cdn/228af1ad-bbe2-4782-874c-9013175039e9/d6a988e8-ad42-4521-b280-ac8db27bc4d9.jpg )   `` pity is treason . '', 
    maximilien robespierre was born in 1758 in arras to an old noble family . 
  at the age of 11 he obtained a scholarship to the prestigious lyc\u00e9e louis-le-grand in paris where he befriended the young camille desmoulins . 
  after graduating he practiced as a lawyer and in 1788 stood as a deputy for the third estate at the meeting of the estates general . 
  later he was also elected to the new national assembly as a member of the radical jacobin club . 
    robespierre 's legend really takes off in august 1792 after the king 's dethronement . 
  unlike danton , robespierre saw no room for mercy in the terror and in 1793 replaced him as leader of the committee of public safety . 
  the reign of terror under robespierre is regarded as perhaps the bloodiest and most violent period of french history . 
    as the terror wore on , robespierre steadily became more ruthless against any opposition . 
  after danton and camille spoke against him , criticising the tyranny and humanity of the government 's actions , he had them both sentenced to the guillotine . 
  while it caused him great pain to send his once closest friend to death he defended his actions by claiming the two posed a threat to the republic . 
  while this might have been true , the impassioned statement might have disguised his real intentions . 
  the truth was that robespierre was becoming increasingly obsessed with the idea of a `` virtuous republic '' , one where only good citizens were fit to live , and one in which the morally ambiguous danton and camille did not belong . 
    contemporaries described robespierre as quiet , shy , anti-social and studious . 
  he was incredibly hard-working and suffered regular bouts of illness and fatigue as a result of his tireless efforts to make a better world . 
  he was scrupulously honest , earning him the nickname the `` incorruptible '' . 
  as a lawyer he campaigned against slavery and the death penalty , however as the revolution took a darker tone so did his principles . 
  blinded by idealism , he became increasingly fanatic and convinced that the republic was his destiny . 
  his descent into dictatorship and tyranny resulted in his own inevitable execution . 
    like robespierre , you might be a little introverted . 
  but woe upon those who think that means they can walk all over you !, 
  you 're a living example of the expression `` be careful of the quiet ones . '', 
  now prove them all wrong and go change the world !, 
   it 's the summer of 1789 , revolution is in the air and with it , three young men are thrust into the harsh light of history . 
  are you as powerful and charismatic as danton or charming yet erratic , like camille ? 
  or perhaps you 're more quietly ruthless like robespierre ?

   * the possibilities of action for david cameron and for the union seem to be very limited . 
  with the serious risk of severe shocks in both camps in case of failure . 
  * eh , first time i am seeing the word `` brexpulsion '' . 
  this does not seems to be impossible for me . 
   * brexit or brexpulsion ? 
  *   * the concern of finance british leaders is obvious : avoid anything that might hinder the city while allowing it to play a major role in the euro market . 
  otherwise , it is simply to enjoy the single market and to expand the maximum , including by signing treaties such as the transatlantic treaty to which london is very favorable . 
  in the statements of british leaders , we see no willingness to strengthen european integration ; priority is given to the opening to the world , judged more dynamic . 
  *   * the english have also more or less far failed to impose this vision , as evidenced by the enlargement of the union twenty-eight countries of unequal economic strength and variously interested in a move towards greater integration . 
  they would ultimately greater incentive to remain in a union that is useful and not forced . 
  but cameron initiative is likely to lead to the opposite result , that is , in the words of iain begg , either by brexit or by brexpulsion .

   a study suggests you should hug a finn , but not a brit . 
    do you greet a stranger by kissing them on the cheek or giving them a firm handshake ? 
  in the largest study ever quantifying where people were comfortable being touched and by whom , 1,300 men and women were asked the same question . 
  the results suggest that when greeting most people , you 're better off with a handshake . 
  article : [ topography of social touching depends on emotional bonds between humans ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/21/1519231112.full.pdf ), 
   in conclusion , westminster can not simply expect to be the sole * demandeur * at the negotiating table . 
  the uk will have to show solidarity with other member states ' desires to shape the european union . 
  cameron should be realistic about what is achievable by 2017 . 
  it would therefore seem advisable that he refrain from pitching his demands too high -- no higher than the level of ambition expressed before parliament on october 19th . 
  he should also adopt a more constructive approach that sets the scene for a convention after 2017 , opening the treaty for a revision that could accommodate both the british demands for an ` opt-out ' from ever closer union and giving leeway to those who wish to integrate further . 
  putting emphasis on strengthening the single market in the more immediate term would allow the prime minister to show his home audience that he is a leading reformer and that the eu gives oxygen to the british economy .
