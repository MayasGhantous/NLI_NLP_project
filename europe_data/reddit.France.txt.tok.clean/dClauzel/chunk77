   [ linguistic anecdotes ] ( http://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/fun/ )   there are , of course , many stories about linguistic misunderstandings in the european parliament . 
  trying to tell a joke in the chamber is always risky : one group ( if you 're lucky ) will laugh immediately , others may laugh ten seconds later and by the time you 've moved on to make a serious point , while the last interpretation of your previous remarks is coming through , you find a group of people the other side of the room suddenly laughing at you . 
  it 's quite perplexing . 
  ces anecdotes sont absolument g\u00e9niales \u2764 * these anecdotes are absolutely great \u2764 *  tes amants   i myself was once going up in the lift when a young french lady came in . 
  i knew she had just started working as an assistant to four german meps . 
  i asked her , `` comment ca va avec tes allemends ? '' ( ` how is it going with your germans ? ' ) . 
  she thought i said , `` comment ca va avec tes amants ? '' ( ` how is it going with your lovers ? ' ) . 
  she replied , `` what do you mean ? 
  i do n't have any ! '' . 
  i said , `` i thought you had four '' . 
  looking shocked , she asked where i had got that idea . 
  i replied , `` you told me -- you said you had four of them . 
  you were looking forward to the challenge . 
  two of them you did n't know before , but you had heard they were quite nice ... '' huhu  roy jenkins , of course , became president of the european commission -- still the only brit to have done so . 
  he was known in brussels at that time as `` king john 15th '' , because of the way his name is pronounced in french . 
  \u2192 `` roi jean quinze ( 15 ) ''  one story is from my colleague michel rocard mep . 
  when he was french prime minister , he had a summit meeting with mrs thatcher as british prime minister . 
  he raised the issue of the single currency . 
  thatcher responded , `` not in a thousand years '' . 
  rocard said , '' i 'm delighted to hear you say that !, 
  you 're not opposed to the principle -- it 's just a question of the timing ! '' h\u00e9h\u00e9 , une attente de 1000 ans est une dur\u00e9e concevable pour l\u2019histoire de l\u2019europe * hehe , a wait of 1000 years is something conceivable for europe 's history *,
