  -- * in the 60s , paperbacks were introduced in france . 
  naturally , some reactionaries people protested against the trivialisation and vulgarisation of the culture , sometimes to the point of turning into a comedy . 
  * * video of an interview for the television news . 
  for the lovers of languages , it is a splendid example of aristocratic and haughty phrasing , that we virtually no longer met . 
  * [ * the paperback and the contempt , 21 september 1964 * ] ( http://www.ina.fr/video/i13043985 )  * a medical student affirms the need for an aristocracy of readers , regretting that the paperbacks offers `` a right of contempt '' . 
  * - * journalist : so you belong to an aristocracy of readers * - * person : yes of course . 
  well , of course ... i do not know if i belong , but i am sure we need an aristocracy of readers . 
  * - * journalist : what do you think of the paperbacks ? 
  * - * person : plenty of bad things . 
  * - * journalist : why ? 
  * - * person : because it is bringing to reading a lot of people who did not need to read , ultimately . 
  who had never felt the need to read . 
  we brought them there , we did [ unintelligible ] la vie en fleur , and all of a sudden they discover themselves with sartre in their hands . 
  it gave them a kind of intellectual pretension they had not . 
  meaning than before people were humbled by the literature , whereas now they are used to take high stances . 
  people have acquired the right to contempt , they had not before . 
  * * yes , culture is a very serious thing in france , and it is defended against anything that might threaten it and could reduce its quality .

  the film follows the exiles through their journey and underlines the international solidarity to which the exodus gave birth . 
  *   * after managing to cross the austrian border , mostly on foot , refugees are identified in makeshift offices . 
  by all available means ( train , plane and boat ) , they join the host countries : france , united kingdom , belgium , canada , holland , italy , norway , brazil and united states , among others . 
  in every country of the same scenes take place : descent of transportation , paperwork and welcome by the local people . 
  in holland , queen juliana itself welcomes refugees in royal palace . 
  *   * as part of an official visit , richard nixon , vice president of the united states , traveled to austria where he met chancellor julius raab . 
  subsequently , this visit is an opportunity to get in touch with the refugee population in joyful public gathering . 
  *   * the documentary focuses on the measures taken by the us to accommodate the exiles . 
  the camera follows the journey of a group of refugees ; arrived in new york harbor , they are greeted by american families and discover a new lifestyle . 
  employment agencies are responsible for finding jobs for refugees , according to their abilities ; for a doctor , a butcher and an apprentice electrician are discussed . 
  in addition , to promote the integration of immigrants , special courses have been set up in schools and universities to teach them english . 
  * about 200000 refugees during the first weeks , and it kept going after that . 
  it is important to remember when one was helped in the past .
