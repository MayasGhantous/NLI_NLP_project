  * reminder : le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de gaulle opposed by 2 times the entry of the united kingdom in the european project . 
   * on 14 january 1963 , general de gaulle held a press conference at which he declared his opposition to the united kingdom 's application for accession . 
  he referred to incompatibilities between continental european and british economic interests . 
  he demanded that the united kingdom accept all the conditions laid down by the six and revoke its commitments to countries within its own free trade area . 
  on 28 january , the french government forced its five european partners , who were already shocked by the unilateral veto , to adjourn the accession negotiations . 
   * aside from the economic arguments put forward to block the united kingdom 's accession , the french president had other concerns . 
  despite the commitments made by his government in economic matters , the british prime minister did not agree with the french views on foreign and defence policy . 
  harold wilson continued to advocate the need for united states involvement in european defence and rejected the establishment of a european nuclear force . 
  the french president feared that in an enlarged community , france would not only be at risk of encountering greater difficulties in defending its economic interests , but that it would also be in danger of losing its leadership role to a more atlanticist policy with the arrival of the new member states . 
  * in 50 years , things have not really changed : the uk still refuses to participate fully in the european project while wanting to be part of it , and so the other countries do not trust it . 
  * i replaced my fridge with a new one , i have a new audio system that goes to sleep when not in use , and i 've switched all the lightbulbs in the house for low power models : my bill electricity has fallen by just over 140 $ per year .

  [ a french message \\ [ from michel rocard \\ ] to britain : get out of europe before you wreck it ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/french-message-britain-get-out-european-union ) , 2014-06-06  the european union is on its knees but you , the british , want to block even small steps to democratic legitimacy toujours aussi pertinent / * still relevant *, 
   the world 's financial centre . 
  nop . 
   the only proper military of the eu . 
  nop nop . 
  plan :  1 ) forcing brussels to make `` an explicit statement '' that britain will be kept out of any move towards a european superstate . 
  this will require an exemption for the uk from the eu 's founding principle of `` ever closer union '' . 
  * so in fact , this is a plan for staying outside of the european union . 
  *  2 ) an `` explicit statement '' that the euro is not the official currency of the eu , making clear that europe is a `` multi-currency '' union . 
  ministers want this declaration in order to protect the status of the pound sterling as a legitimate currency that will always exist . 
  * the euro being pointedly one of the means for getting closer the countries of the european union , and to improve and simplify their economies , it means that the uk refuses to be part of it . 
  *  3 ) a new `` red card '' system to bring power back from brussels to britain . 
  this would give groups of national parliaments the power to stop unwanted directives being handed down and to scrap existing eu laws . 
  * a veto which does not dare to say its name . 
  the vetos are precisely what block the current decision process . 
  also , to scrap the existing laws ? 
  this is absolutely delusional . 
  *  4 ) a new structure for the eu itself . 
  the block of 28 nations must be reorganised to prevent the nine countries that are not in the eurozone being dominated by the 19 member states that are , with particular protections for the city of london . 
  * the uk wants to be part of the european union , but while refusing to be part of it , and also in a way that prevents the others members to work . 
  nice . 
  * this plan is more than a giant joke , it is a vast blunt hypocrisy on a nationalist background . 
  it has no chance of being accepted by the other countries of the european union .
