  yes , like the huge majority of people in my age group . 
  here are the mandatory vaccinations for french people : [ 1 ] ( http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/f724.xhtml ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.ameli.fr/assures/prevention-sante/la-vaccination.php ) ( same info with different comments ) . 
  the controversy on the vaccine against hepatitis b was what the name suggest : a controversy ( sources [ 1 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaccin_contre_l'h%c3%a9patite_b#risques_et_controverses ) , [ 2 ] ( http://controverses.sciences-po.fr/archive/hepatiteb/wordpress/index-24750.html ) ) . 
  short simplified story : when you augment the volume of vaccinated people , you statistically augment the number of individuals who have an allergic reaction to the vaccine . 
  having more people reacting to a vaccine make the people more aware of this possibility , leading to a shitstorm of paranoia . 
  the vaccine against hepatitis b is currently still recommended by the various medical comities , because of its huge benefits and low risks . 
  there has been nothing really new on this since 6 years ago . 
  the vaccine is still proposed to teenagers during the preventive care campaigns , and there is no opposition . 
  really ? 
  there are no mandatory vaccinations in germany, 
  avant l'\u00e9lection de poutine ?

  he is going to be so happy about that ... *, 
  * i am not certain to recognise him ; who is he ? 
  * because europe is founded on multilingualism !, 
  and that we are `` 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit '' . 
  * let 's being honest : the only ones immediately identifiable are the german and the french . 
  the english is excluded because he is cheating : he has got a flag . 
  * or maybe we have a normal sexuality , like the japanese . 
  mhhhh , in fact , no . 
  the japanese are really weird , so it must be something else . 
  mais k\u00e9skidi ? 
  * u wot m8 ? 
  finishing in france . 
  we did some ok pictures , dodged the cats turned crazy by the unusual night activity , managed not to wake up st\u00e9ph , and drank some rum because honestly it was a bit boring .
