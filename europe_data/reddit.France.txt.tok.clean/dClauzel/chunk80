   understanding how road networks influence the spread of towns is a key goal of urban science . 
  the digitization of one of the greatest maps ever made should help . 
    in 1747 , king louis xv of france ordered the cartographer c\u00e9sar-fran\u00e7ois cassini de thury to draw a map of france using the revolutionary new technique of geodesic triangulation . 
  cassini -- the grandson of the astronomer who discovered several moons of saturn and the division of its rings that bears his name -- divided the country into 180 rectangles , each 80 kilometers by 50 kilometers , and started work on a map at a scale of 1:86,400 . 
    so began one of the greatest feats in the history of map-making . 
  the map took more than 50 years to complete and involved four generations of the cassini family . 
  the resulting work -- now known as the cassini map -- consists of 180 plates showing the country at a level of detail that was unprecedented then and is still admired today . 
    [ ... ]   the digitized maps are freely available [ here ] ( http://geoportail.fr/url/7f7dsq ) .
