   ** france extends its maritime area of nearly 500,000 km2 **   * la france has expanded , by almost 500,000 km2 according to ifremer , its maritime area off its overseas territories , indicate four decrees published sunday in the * journal officiel * and entered into force on monday . 
  *   * france , which has the second largest maritime area in the world after the united states , with some 11 million km2 , extends its maritime area by nearly 500,000 km2 , with the publication of these decrees , roughly the area of the metropolis , has told afp beno\u00eet loubrieu , one of the managers from ifremer of the continental shelf extension program of the extraplac program . 
  *   * this is the first decrees that seem to respond to all the submission and review of steps taken by france to the united nations to extend its maritime domain , he said . 
  *   * the four decrees define the outer limits of the continental shelf off the coast of martinique and guadeloupe , guyana , new caledonia and the kerguelen islands . 
  *   * they point out that these limits are set on the basis of recommendations made by the commission on the limits of the continental shelf of the united nations in april 2012 for the antilles and the kerguelen islands , and in september 2009 for guyana and new caledonia . 
  *   * the law of the sea currently sets the eez of a country to 200 nautical miles ( about 370 km ) from its shores , giving sovereignty in this area to exploit the soil and subsoil resources . 
  in addition , the waters are legally regarded as international . 
  *   * one country , however , the right to claim the extension of its exclusive economic zone beyond the traditional 200 miles , and up to a limit of 350 miles , bringing into play geological studies to support the limits of its continental shelf extended underwater . 
  *   * if all applications submitted by france , under the un convention on the law of the sea ( montego bay , 1982 ) , were validated , maritime domain under french jurisdiction could increase by at least one million km2 , according to loubrieu . 
  *   * among other applications from france , one concerning the archipelago of saint pierre et miquelon . 
  but this request opposes paris and ottawa , seabed being potentially rich in hydrocarbons effect .
