   in july 1453 , a french army crushed its english opponents at the [ battle of castillon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_castillon ) , the last major engagement of the [ hundred years war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundred_years_war ) . 
  the decisive victory at castillon showcased the power of artillery against charging masses of infantry and allowed the french to capture [ bordeaux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bordeaux ) a few months later . 
  the english subsequently lost their major remaining possessions on the european continent .
