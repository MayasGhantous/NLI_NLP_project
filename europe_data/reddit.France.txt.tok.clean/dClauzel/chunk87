  1 ) given the situation of the brexit and an eventual `` scotentering '' ( is this a word yet ? 
  ) , what orientations and actions is currently taking scotland for positioning itself in europe and in the world ? 
  would it be better for scotland to keep a certain distance and to define itself as a self supporting player , or to dive into the european projet and to risk being in the shadow of bigger countries ? 
  2 ) what are the real chances of scotland managing to join the european union ( if the people choose this path ) after the uk became separated from the eu ? 
  is it really doable ? 
  what would be the main problem for doing it ?

  no , there are no official information . 
  in doubt , ask the official twitter accounts or le monde 's live thread . 
  aaaaaaand once again the dailymail is `` reporting '' crap : there is no hostage situation , and there never was . 
  please stop readingthis newspaper , and more important stop quoting it . 
  single source , multiple reports . 
  see / r/europe/comments / 4svpqa/possible _ shooting_at_boulevard_nice_while / d5cl4c0, 
  no , it is an extract from an informal supposition from the tribunal ( le parquet ) of nice . 
  definitely not coming from hospitals , the police , the gouvernement , etc. 
  basically , this apport no information but only noise ; this is more misleading than helpful . 
  impossible . 
  such info are not communicate this soon , because they do not exist yet . 
  be ** very ** carefull with estrosi . 
  he is a ** giant ** political troll and liar . 
  `` attaque terroriste '' has a precise -- and legal -- definition . 
  currently : * no official info for the moment , but this is not a simple accident ( but can still be a very bad and complicated accident ... mwouais ... ) * official word is `` possible attentat '' * no official confirmation for gunshots * driver has been killed * no hostage situation * thinks are always confused during the events ... and the british tabloids are not helping . 
  neither are cnn and such like drama vampires,
