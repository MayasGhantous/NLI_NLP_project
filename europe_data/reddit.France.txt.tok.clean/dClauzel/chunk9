  let 's talk about `` [ * wesh * ] ( https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/wesh ) '' ( only in english because the french people already know this ) . 
  * wesh * is a word coming from maroc and alg\u00e9rie -- not sure they have it somewhere else ( tunisie very probably has it too ) -- and is very common to hear it , especially in an ironic way . 
  * wesh * is arabic/berber , meaning -- in the french context , as it is an imported word -- `` what '' or `` how '' . 
  examples ? 
  * '' : `` what it is with you ? '' ; * wesh rak * ? 
  : `` how are you ? '' . 
  hence simply `` * wesh ? 
  * '' means `` so ( what 's new ) ? '' some possible uses : - * wech dahlek ? 
  * : what are you messing with me ? 
  * : what do you want ? 
  * : what went through your mind ? 
  * , meaning `` hello dude , are you alright or are you alright ? '' ; because nobody answers `` bad '' when you ask someone how he is - knowing that * meuf * is [ verlan ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/verlan ) for * femme * , `` * wesh meuf * '' hence is `` hello girl '' in a very familiar urban way bonus : [ wesh moli\u00e8re ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rkkhyjd.jpg ),
