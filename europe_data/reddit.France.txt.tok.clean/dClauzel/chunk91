  indeed , you did not submit the link in this submission , but only your comment . 
  if you want to comment a link you submitted , you must do it in a separated comment into the thread : reddit technically does not allow submission of a combo link + text . 
  non , trop long .

   an amusingly written clinical report describes a 50 year old italian man who stopped speaking his native italian and insisted on speaking broken and somewhat fake french after a neurological event ( beschin et al. , 2016 ) . 
  an abnormality in his basilar artery blocked the necessary flow of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) , with hydrocephalus and brainstem vascular encephalopathy as a result . 
  a typical example of the condition ( known as megadolicho basilar artery ) in another patient is shown below .

  *   * during my travels through france , i could taste several kinds of regional sausages . 
  *   * here is a mini tour de france of this butcher 's product developed in many areas , the choice of the raw material component sausage will differ from one region to another * bon app\u00e9tit, 
   * after the announcement of the referendum results on the brexit , the former presenter of the international press review on france inter is still furious seeing the party of `` leave '' win . 
  *   * `` for the first time in my life , i 'm ashamed to be british '' : through this bitter tweet alex taylor expressed anger this morning , once known the results of the referendum . 
  the pain of the most european journalists from france , former host of the international press review on france inter , is immense . 
  his anger against his country and the proponents of hatred is just as important . 
  he agreed to let us know .
