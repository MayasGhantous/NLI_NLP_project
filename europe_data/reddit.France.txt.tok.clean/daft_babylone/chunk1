yup , that 's the joke of my post . 
  congratulations , you won . 
  well , that 's just like your opinion man . 
  if it means that / r/europe does n't become our / r/worldnews version , then i 'm happy with it . 
  nice try , british agent # 2 . 
  given the amount of shit posts and shit posters here , i support him in trying to clean the sub as much as he can do . 
  plus , the translation thing is awesome and i 'd love to see it done by everyone . 
  no it 's like a unicorn to us . 
   you ai n't ** parisian ** if you are n't 15min late ftfy, 
  ( wtf ?!, 
  always the english who do it strangely ) * quiquiriqu\u00ed !, 
  * kukuryku !, 
  * etc ... 
  never heard of any of them , except a few germans you quoted , just because i 'm interested in electronic music . 
  but for every decade , i can give you tons of british musicians and bands . 
  worldwidely known brazilian music ? 
  do you have names ? 
  germans as well , i ca n't think of anyone but nena , 
  while i agree with the sense of music british people certainly have ( at least according to the standards they established ) , the globalization has certainly its importance on this . 
  there is good music coming from every single country in the world , just that we hear more about the british , and ` murica 's ones more than coming from anywhere else . 
  but that 's a completely other subject . 
  just 50 % of your economy . 
  `` not that great '' huh ? 
   the eu dislikes the london banking sector ( because reu except sweden does n't have a notable banking sector itself ) that 's not at all the reason why . 
  it 's not a problem by itself , it 's just a consequence of politicians trying to lure people . 
  and it 's good to talk about it one time , two times or even three times , but every goddamn day , where quiet everyone agrees that `` we do not give a damn '' , it 's too much . 
  not even mentionning those stupid provocating articles from abroad newspapers modifying the reality to just bash france ... talking about problems is one thing , reacting to them like children is another . 
  we never do that ? 
  except when cutting them in quarters , when not eating the whole apple right away . 
  i personaly do n't even skin potatoes . 
  there was no advertizing of the survey on / r/france and basically , we hear more about / r/food than / r/europe on our sub . 
  same . 
  shame : /, 
  and he 's wayyyy funnier . 
  this !, 
  my favourite piano `` song '' with the 3rd mvt of the moonlight sonata !, 
  hypothetical yes , fictional , i personaly do n't believe so . 
   people are fundamentally good and would never murder each other in the ( fictional ) state of nature , without providing any evidence at all , despite their being some against you . 
  yes  as much for than against . 
  of course they will always be exceptions , for every `` rule '' there are exceptions , such as mental disorder and such ( in this particular case ) . 
  but i take the risk of making that generalization . 
  the thing is that , this discussion is more about `` who is right '' than `` what is the truth '' ( your fault as much as mine , this is n't an attack ) . 
  and about the latter , of course we will never know , but you can guess what i believe in . 
  and i 'd rather believe that people are good than the opposite , which is , sadly , more proeminant in today 's society . 
  but if humans were bad by nature , how could it be that our race survived that long ? 
  i 'm talking about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_nature ) . 
   there have been crushed skulls discovered in the neolithic area your link talks about only one skull , dude !, 
  and btw , neolithic is the beginning of the sedentarisation , meaning economy , property and stuff like this . 
  that 's not what i qualify as `` natural '' . 
  [ thank you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prehistoric_warfare#paleolithic ) . 
   this behavior may have accelerated the migration out of africa of h. erectus some 1.8 million years ago as a natural consequence of conflict avoidance . 
  some scholars believe that this period of `` paleolithic warlessness '' persisted until well after the appearance of homo sapiens some 200,000 years ago , ** ending only at the occurrence of economic and social shifts associated with sedentism , when new conditions incentivized organized raiding of settlements **  of the many cave paintings of the upper paleolithic , none depict people attacking other people . 
  [ 7 ] [ 8 ] the only rock art that depicts violence between hunter-gatherers comes from a unique northern australian sequence that began approximately 10,000 years ago . 
  [ 9 ] ** skeletal and artifactual evidence of intergroup violence between paleolithic nomadic foragers is absent as well . 
  one sentence by a random redditor is n't a source . 
  i 'm going to ask you for a source about this . 
  i have n't met ones that wanted to kill me , yes . 
  i think , that you have n't too . 
  yes i mean `` by default '' . 
  without considering our social and cultural constructions . 
  and especially when it comes to motivate you to kill other people in the name of a country . 
  you said it , those are exceptions . 
  and envy or romantic ok , but money and `` social problems '' are n't what i consider `` natural '' . 
  never forget that such wars only happend when the leaders of the involved countries could n't settle their differences diplomatically . 
  never forget that no human being would want to kill other human beings naturally . 
  anger towards other nations only come from propaganda and interpretations . 
  do n't tell , and should i say , do n't even dare to think that there are some other people that only want to spoil/kill you . 
  every human being just want to live peacefully . 
  always keep that in mind before judging and condemning other people only based on a label , called `` nationality '' . 
  there are differences , but we mostly all have common life goals . 
  only stupid and ignorant people think that only the usa are doing it . 
   why people dislike the french more than any other european country i do n't want at all to enter your debate ( my opinion is that you 're both just insulting yourselves , so a kinda sterile `` debate '' ) . 
  but this sentence may be accurate , for some countries ( especially and mostly anglophone countries ) , but actually , if you ever say that to a french guy , he might be proud of it . 
  especially if you 're talking about politics . 
  and especially if you 're coming from an anglophone country . 
  my 2 cents . 
  i guess we learn more about other people 's mistakes than ours . 
   you guys are literally defending murder . 
  this is despicable . 
  thanks for writing it in bold . 
  i did n't at all understood what your point was . 
  plus the little personal attack just after makes it delicious . 
  now , you saw what my point was , you even said it by yourself . 
  i 'm done here . 
   absolve the french government of any guilt . 
  so you 're like the other guy saying that it is the exact same kind of thing than russian assinations ? 
  def hope you 're not a judge or lawyer . 
   pereira went back to take pictures of the damage . 
  do you read `` he died all by himself '' ? 
  if so , i stop this discussion here . 
  observations and judgements are two different things . 
  so you 're from new zealand ? 
  nice people you got there . 
   are you trying to say it was his fault ? 
  he did n't said it . 
  at all . 
  one of the main reasons ? 
  really ? 
  that happends decades ago , and in france you know about the story only if you are cultivated , but what about australia ? 
  do you all know this story ?
