  indeed . 
  i was thinking 14 july was more likely , but those taxi drivers have gone a week or so without injuring anyone so who knows . 
  people are really getting disturbed by posts with two languages ? 
  i 've been a bit busy and have n't been on / r/europe following the action too much . 
  personally i always liked them myself .

  i 've been busier than a billsticker in a big wind and have n't been round / r/europe getting stuck in today .

  ljubljana - just gorgous , the people are friendly , and so close . 
  i used [ this economist cover ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/print-cover-full/20060624issuecovfe400.jpg ) as a way of kick-starting discussions in a university class i taught on migration and religion in france . 
  always did the trick . 
  apologies - i said ` subway ' in the post title , but it is ` public transport ' in tweet . 
  it 's not all young people , it 's only young people who have n't managed to find any work at all after trying consistently for six months . 
  there 's a similar scheme in australia ( called ` work for the dole ' there ) and i assume this is something similar : it 'll be menial work , more to discourage young people from sitting around on welfare for years at a time when they have other options . 
  yes , there are people who have real difficulties getting a job , any job . 
  and there are real problems of youth unemployment compared to the otherwise not-too-bad general unemployment rate in the uk ( unemployment is about three times worse for 16-24 years olds than the general population ) . 
  but when someone is not in training , not in school/college/university , and has not been able to find a job despite government support in 6 months , do you jsut keep paying them ? 
  not a perfect solution , but it was part of the policy platform and the tories [ foreshadowed it back in february ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure ) so it should n't be a surprise . 
  edit : just realised the date on the article is february , too . 
  while it is not unthinkable , there is nothing in the article that confirms that us groups are bankrolling one side or another . 
  instead there are accusations from one side and flat out denials from the other . 
  a little proof would be nice so as to give the headline some legitimacy . 
  my understanding is that eu citizens can vote in local elections union-wide . 
  i do n't know of a member state that extends national voting rights to foreign nationals , though from memory hollande did talk about it during the last election campaign before giving up on it pretty quick afterwards . 
  it depends on what is in the bill , i guess . 
  details would be good . 
  for example , i live in france and , though i am not a french citizen , i am an eu citizen . 
  french people have the right to vote for the president here and i do not - when it comes to voting rights , the french citizens do have more rights than i do . 
  on the other hand , when my friend from australia visits , i have more rights than he does . 
  on the surface ( and it may be rather limited ) my french girlfriend has more rights than i do , but i have more rights than my non-eu citizen friends . 
  this is not `` clearly untenable '' to me , and i do n't feel it is `` inconsistent with the very notion of fundamental human rights '' . 
  depending on how things turn out the reality on the ground in the uk could be anything from ` same as france ' ( that is , no big deal ) to denial of basic human rights ( worst possible circumstance ) . 
  on the bright side , come 1 january 2017 it will [ finally be legal to sing ` happy birthday to you ' in the eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/happy_birthday_to_you#copyright_status ) without paying a fee to the copyright holder ... 
  it was the title , save for the first trolling words . 
  full title was `` 50 shades of subterfuge : rape charges as ` male model ' offering sex in dark turns out to be balding 68-year-old '' . 
  no worries , though . 
  also on [ i24 news now ] ( http://www.i24news.tv/fr/actu/international/europe/69766-150502-france-antisemitisme-deux-juifs-attaques-par-une-quarantaine-d-individus ) . 
  ah , my mistake - i read le monde juif as le monde . 
  apologies - i 'll edit . 
  crif has a bias , but they are reporting specific injuries not mentioned in the other report . 
  there 's always a way to find a justification for hatred if your mind works in that way . 
  the [ 2002 bali bombings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_bali_bombings#suspects ) were justified by obl because of australia 's support for the liberation of east timor . 
  hence , the killing of ( majority ) christian australians on a hindu island was justified by islamist terrorists because of the liberation of catholics . 
  hate does n't rely on logic . 
  good point . 
  there 's an additional report in ~ ~ le monde ~ ~ [ le monde juif ] ( http://www.lemondejuif.info/2015/05/info-lmj-paris-deux-jeune-juifs-attaques-par-une-quarantaine-dindividus/ ) citing the comments of the bureau national de vigilance contre l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme ( bnvca ) . 
  this group did n't appear in the jss piece - maybe the story is starting to emerge ? 
  there 's also tweets with more specific details of the injuries on the [ crif twitter feed ] ( https://twitter.com/le_crif/status/594157857987284992 ) . 
  more information from jss ( in france ) is [ here ] ( http://jssnews.com/2015/05/01/paris-boulevard-voltaire-40-racailles-attaquent-2-juifs-en-pleine-journee/ ) . 
  thanks for the link . 
  i 'm guessing that it has to do with how the who classified states back when it was first set up . 
  at that time the ussr would have been considered european so , when it fell apart , the states that emerged from the former soviet space continued to be counted in the european area by the who . 
  i imagine this makes statistical comparisons easier , though it is strange to have a country counted as european that is so far away . 
  a breakdown by country is [ here in pdf ] ( http://www.sviva.gov.il/english/resourcesandservices/newsandevents/newsandmessagedover/documents/economic%20cost%20of%20deaths%20from%20air%20pollution%20-%20who%20region%20-%202010.pdf ) . 
  might be relevant that the who definition of europe stretches well into central asia where the relative costs are very high . 
  for example , france and switzerland come out at a cost of 2.3 % of gdp and 2.5 % of gdp respectively , while for tajikistan ( 20.3 % ) and kyrgyzstan ( 24 % ) it 's a lot higher . 
  that said , plenty to be concerned about , though i would like to read a little about the methodology . 
  i suspect that the costs include life years and economic potential ` lost ' through early death .

  how would homosexuals have children ? 
  either via adoption , ivf , or custody from a previous relationship . 
  on the bright side this probably means that ` rocky iv ' getting a run on tv is becoming more likely . 
  i understand your point but i disagree . 
  to extend your sports example , i am proud of myself when i run faster or climb a higher mountain than i could the season before . 
  i feel i can be proud of this because - whatever small achievement it represents compared to others - i have achieved something i could not before . 
  being born european is not the same . 
  sure , if i contributed in a significant way to building the continent then maybe i could claim to be proud of my achievement . 
  but if europe goes completely backwards i wo n't be less european , nor likely will i be significantly to blame . 
  i 'm glad to be an eu citizen , quite glad to be an australian citizen , too . 
  but proud ? 
  like my skin colour , the colour of my eyes , and my height , these are just some other things i was basically born with . 
  i am an expat australian living in france for nearly a decade . 
  it might seem strange but what i miss are the colours and the light . 
  the desert in the north-west of australia where i grew up has a red dust that was infuriating when i lived there , but which i am yet to see replicated in france . 
  it 's hard to describe the colour - we called it ` red dust ' but it was rusty , somewhere between orange and red , i guess - and i have never seen it since leaving and arriving in europe , save in photos . 
  it also seems to me that the light is different in australia , though i imagine that is childhood memories and long summers mixing in my memories more than anything real . 
  that said , if either were things i missed enough to return , i would have done so by now . 
  france is home , as far as i am concerned . 
  indeed . 
  plus assad has condemned the attacks this morning according to british sources ( bbc and guardian ) . 
  sure . 
  but it still exists on the legal territory of an actually legally and internationally recogized state . 
  you 'd want that legal state onside before dropping anything bomb-like . 
  sets a precedent if it was not ordered by the state , though . 
  one thing might be the lack of a state actor to attack . 
  9/11 had afghanistan but which state would france respind to here ?
