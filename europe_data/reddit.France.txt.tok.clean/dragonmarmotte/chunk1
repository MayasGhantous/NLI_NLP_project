well , it does seem to be a good predictor of cardiovascular events though . 
  maybe less than ldl measure or triglycerides , but at least you do n't need a blood sample . 
  funnily enough it as been theorized that it could be a good measure of female attractiveness . 
  you are probably right , some people put the excess of diabetes in dom toms on sugary drinks and food . 
  well it is not true for all dom toms territories , you have to scavenge through the [ beh ] ( http://invs.santepubliquefrance.fr/beh/ ) publications if you want the details . 
  but as an example , the [ cour des comptes ] ( https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahukewjxzkitl-tpahwe1bokhsmncr8qfggcmaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ccomptes.fr%2fcontent%2fdownload%2f69055%2f1863914%2fversion%2f3%2ffile%2f20140612_rapport_thematique_sante_outre_mer.pdf&amp;usg=afqjcnhfmtyeneosu_qpigqvo0hrqqv01g&amp;sig2=vo-0dfqadekklov8lxu2zg&amp;cad=rja ) reported a prevalence of obesity of 40.4 % in french polynesia and 26.5 % in new caledonia in 2014 . 
  according to [ ob\u00e9pi ] ( http://www.roche.fr/content/dam/roche_france/fr_fr/doc/obepi_2012.pdf ) the average french prevalence is around 15 % and 21.8 % for the north . 
  another parameter is [ diabetes ] ( http://invs.santepubliquefrance.fr/beh/2008/43/beh_43_2008.pdf ) , since it is linked to obesity in 80 % of the cases . 
  in 2007 , with an average french prevalence of 3.95 % , you have the north at 4.8 % , guadeloupe at 7.3 % , martinique at 6.8 % and la r\u00e9union at 7.8 %, 
  bmi is kind of silly measure though , waist to hip ratio is more effective to assess obesity . 
  fun fact : the regions with the most obese people per capita are the dom-toms . 
  but the north is up there too . 
  yes , the danish y sounds like the french u to me . 
  but to be honest i still struggle with danish pronunciation , so i might just be that i 'm very bad . 
  `` y '' is pronounced kinda like `` u '' in danish , however i 'm never saw any \u00dc . 
  not sure it 's related to the context , but the guy next to the president is [ tommy cash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogmrzkijku ) ( nsfw ) , an estonian rapper . 
  yes , it is not far , just at the city 's entrance . 
  and even without any proof , some people in calvi are adamant that he was born here !, 
  this is the citadel , or the old city , the rest of the actual city is behind . 
  visiting the citadel is fantastic though , there is a piano-bar at the top that let you enjoy the view while you chill and sip on a ( very expensive ) mojito . 
  during the summer , there is a music festival therem it is called `` calvi on the rocks '' it i very fun . 
  napol\u00e9on was kept in elba island . 
  napol\u00e9on 's godfather had a house here though and napol\u00e9on stayed there for a while . 
  christopher columbus is also said to have been born here , you can even visit what is left of the house where he was supposedly born . 
  well , i am not an expert so i will not say it will make you completely immune , but for the hiv-1 strand , it disrupt its entry door into its host cell , so i do n't see how it could infect you otherwise . 
  the resistance is specific to the hiv-1 though ( but it is by far the most common strand outside of africa ) , so i say do n't try your luck . 
  to check if you are resistant you would have to do a genotyping , like 23andme , but i do n't know if there is any commercial chip that check for it ( the name of the mutation is ccr5-delta32 or rs333 by the way , if you want to search ) . 
  edit : [ apparently ] ( http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?threads/check-if-you-are-naturally-immune-to-hiv-via-23andme-results.28913/ ) , 23andme does check for it . 
  wow , that much ? 
  the 1 % estimate is for caucasians of mixed origins , but i guess it can go much higher for some regions . 
  there is a mutation on on the ccr5 gene that makes you resistant to hiv-1 infection , somewhat frequent in eastern european countries ( between 1 % and 5 % of the population , depending on the country ) . 
  [ more information ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15556703 ) more information about repartition [ here ] ( http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8898752 ) and [ here ] ( http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v2/n11/abs/nm1196-1240.html ) . 
  it seems to have been found in caucasian populations ( around 10 % carry the mutation , but you have to be homzygote to be completely resistant , which corresponds to 1 % of white caucasians approximatively ) , the mutation has n't been found in other groups ( blacks and asians ) . 
  well , kinda , it 's inspired from this [ dish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/farinata ) but i do n't really follow the traditional recipe . 
  thank you !, 
  i wanted to learn how to make it instead of buying it . 
  how to make a chickpea galette : - smash some chickpeas ( boiled beforehand ) - add beaten eggs ( approx . 
  1 egg per 100g of chickpeas ) . 
  - add cheese to the mix ( my heart goes to comt\u00e9 in this case ) , a bit of salt and a bit of garlic . 
  - if you want , you can add some pepper , cumin or coriander . 
  once everything is mixed , you can shape the dough as you wish and fry it on a pan with some oil ( rapeseed oil recommended ) . 
  i usually like to eat my chickpea galette on a slice of rugbr\u00f8d with tomatoes , salad and some sauce b\u00e9arnaise , but that 's up to you . 
  well , it will still teach you some basic phrases and it 's free . 
  i used it for danish and it was worth it . 
  we take their heat via atlantic currents . 
  i can already feel myself crawling back to the sea !, 
  have you ever been to corsica ? 
  - during the 300s : france is under roman control . 
  in the early 300s , christianism becomes the official religion of the empire , death penalty by crucifixion is abolished . 
  around 350 , the north-east will be invaded by several germanic tribes ( alemanni , salian franks ... ) , most will eventually be driven back by the romans , and some will stay under roman rule . 
  in 395 ad , the empire is split , and france becomes part of the western roman empire . 
  - during the 400s : in the early 400s , after sacking rome in 410 , the visigoths establish themselves in aquitania , in the south-west . 
  salian franks extend their territory in northern france . 
  enventually , both tribes are checked by a roman general named flavius aetius . 
  around 430 , aetius also leads a campaign against burgundians and reach a peace agreement with the visigoths . 
  around 440-450 , more germanic tribes settle in france , such as the alans , britons migrate to armorica ( britanny ) . 
  in 451 , attila arrives in france and is stopped by a roman/visigoth army led by aetius and theodoric i. 
  in 454 , emperor valentinian iii stabs flavius aetius , and therefore , kills his most proficient general , only to be killed himself one year later . 
  from now on , france will be a major shitfest involving the remaining romans , visigoths , burgundians , franks and other germanic tribes . 
  western roman empire falls around 475 , france is divided in several barbaric kingdoms . 
  - during the 500s : the frankish kingdom extends significantly under the reign of clovis i , after defeating other barbaric kingdoms . 
  in 508 , roman catholicism becomes the official religion of the frankish kingdom . 
  clovis i dies in 511 , the frankish kingdom is divided among his sons . 
  around 530 , franks invade the kingdom of burgundy , located in the south-east . 
  - around 560-570 , lot of internal struggles among the frankish nobility . 
  in 600 , france is still occupied by several barbaric kingdoms , the main ones being the franks , but they are still divided . 
  great , now i 'm hungry !, 
  i have to find myself one of those \u00e6bleskiver fry pans someday . 
  koldsk\u00e5l during the summer , \u00e6bleskiver during the winter , got it !, 
  more smokers per capita in france but the american smokers consume more cigarettes , that 's how i understand it . 
  those statistics are per capita though . 
  i known a guy that voted le pen because he wanted to `` wake people up '' but he does n't want her to win . 
  when you play with fire ... 
  in ajaccio , there was a sushi bar that made makis with corsican food inside , a part of me thought it was heresy but it was delicious . 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2r7vnjh1t4&amp;t=7m10s ) ? 
  indeed , my bad . 
   french  seeing ~ ~ uk ~ ~ england losing as traumatic nah ...

  you probably already know this book , but have you read salammb\u00f4 from gustave flaubert ? 
  you might be interested in it . 
  oh , i learned a new word , thank you !, 
  we have surstr\u00f6mming on the sandwich table ? 
  my mother was 21 and my father 26 . 
  people in my family all had children between 20 and 25 . 
  through french and spanish i can understand a bit of italian and a bit of portuguese , i have not been practising spanish for a long time but i still can understand it fairly well . 
  i can read danish but i still struggle a lot understanding it when spoken to , through danish i can somewhat read norwegian and swedish , i can also understand words from german and dutch ( like arbeite , kartoffel etc. . . ) but that 's about it . 
   for kids : go\u00fbter around 16:30 , cereal bars , fruits , stuff like that . 
  hey !, 
  it 's not only for kids okay !, 
   some years ago a colleague of mine thought the mohammed merah terrorist attack was a conspiracy made by the government my step-mother transforms into a geopolitics and secret services expert as soon as you mention this one . 
  you find the usual ones , anti-vaxxer that believe the `` big pharma '' is going after us , some 9/11 conspiracy there and there , they often believe that the attacks in france were false flag too , the `` jewish conspiracy '' is also popular among some people . 
   religion has absolutly no place in school  any head of a school allowing that to happen would be crucified hehe on a more serious tone , it is not allowed in public school but it might be a thing in private schools . 
  i am a phd student , so not a scientist yet , i study the genetic component of thrombosis and stenosis . 
  i am from marseille , its estimated age is 2600 years old , thanks to the greeks . 
  to add to / u/mnyx comment , paris is also filled with names of european places , like place stalingrad , gare d'austerlitz , rue de crim\u00e9e ( crimea ) , jardin du luxembourg , etc. . . 
  in marseille , the only things i can recall are the rue d'hambourg ( hamburg street ) and the corniche which actual full name is `` corniche du pr\u00e9sident john fitzgerald kennedy '' . 
  i 'm surprised that even saturn did n't accept card payment , i saw it as the fnac/darty ( i do n't which one suits better ) of germany . 
  but i learned my lesson , next time i will carry more cash . 
  oh yes , i went to hamburg in december and i thought i would be fine with my card and a small bit of cash , and almost no business except for museums and big department stores would take my card . 
  [ the song of roland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_song_of_roland ) might be the oldest piece of french literature ( excluding roman litterature ) , it is kinda hard to read because it 's basically proto-french .
