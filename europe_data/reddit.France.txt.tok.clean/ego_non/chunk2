  it 's just the most expensive city in france , what did you expect ? 
  it 's simple `` what if they have weapons ? 
  we 've the best with the champagne , haha ! '', 
  sort of cover . 
  message is we 'll continue to party , and live * \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise * , no matter the threat , no matter the dead . 
  they 're mocking the fact that they ca n't enjoy life , which we obviously do ( remember muslims can not drink , normally ) . 
  must have been invented by someone who `` coulait un bronze aux chiottes '' , 
   hollande decided that `` the stadium was the safest place for fans . 
  i 've been discussing this with friends and so , and it 's true : before our president comes to a stadium , or anywhere , his security will lock up everything for half a day and look * everywhere * if there 's anything suspect . 
  so if there are bombs * outside * , it means that * inside * is the best place to be . 
  hence why this decision made a lot of sense . 
  i 've said it before , but this decision may have saved lots of lives - i just did n't know hollande was behind it . 
  you and i do n't know how or when this attack has been planned , if it 's truly an attack because of what isis did ( i doubt so ; france has been attacking isis for over a month now ) . 
  my message was * informative * , there was absolutely no opinion attached to it . 
  yet here you are yelling after me . 
  it 's a lot because they are extremely precise and can pierce up to 7m of reinforced concrete . 
  they 're high technology , it 's not a random bomb an aircraft will throw on a building hoping it 'll hit .

  [ and no civilian was wounded ] ( https://twitter.com/romaincaillet/status/666002985105956864 ) . 
  it was n't a tabloid , i 'm pretty sure of this because i do n't read tabloids . 
  so it was a serious newspaper . 
  i just ca n't recall which !, 
  but yeah , i guess the attacks on paris suddenly made the danger more vivid . 
  i read just yesterday that the british intelligence service was fearing an attack of the same type in london . 
  i honestly ca n't find where because i 've read dozens articles yesterday . 
  stay safe , everyone . 
   complaining about my government is part of my national identity . 
  wait , i thought that was ours to begin with ... 
  hey , hey , france has a long history with the uk , do n't look down on us !, 
  do you know how many battles we fought ~ ~ together ~ ~ against each other ? 
  uhuh , they set traps for fire workers actually , that makes me so mad but ... 
  they put the bin on fire so that they have to come and then attack them . 
  i really have no words for this . 
  at least they did a few years back . 
  they also set fire to cars etc. 
  riots happen from time to time , no one really talk about them - they 're considered the past . 
  now i completely agree that some areas have been abandonned , but it 's also hard when the same people often fight with our firemen , ambulances , policemen , people who are sent to them to actually * help * them . 
  `` vous '' is used to show respect , policemen should * always * use it towards people while doing their jobs . 
  and people should * always * use vous to talk to them . 
  it goes both ways . 
  same with vendors , etc. 
  it also helps with putting some distance between yourself and the person you 're talking with . 
  and after this , there are other shades , like , if an older person is talking to a youngster , etc , etc. 
  things get complicated from there on !, 
  ddg is a super-search engine though , it collects results through several search engines before sending them to you . 
  qwant is just a normal search engine . 
  you can change that . 
  i put it at 1m personnally because it 's the actual worst case scenario given by the nasa . 
  and it 's already changing our coasts more than a little bit . 
  [ please read this ] ( http://climate.nasa.gov/news/2329/ ) . 
  it 's more serious than what you make out to be . 
  the problem is that many countries are very close to sea level , and any change can be disastrous . 
  also , you can see that [ with this map ] ( http://www.floodmap.net/ ) . 
  honestly , sea level is one of the biggest problem of climate change . 
  not to mention he clearly uses his position as a weather broadcaster :  `` every night i address five million french people to talk to you about the wind , the clouds and the sun , '' verdier , who denies being a climate change sceptic , said in a promotional video for the book . 
  they are right to fire him . 
  it sounds like he is an authority in the domain , that he speaks up for both france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions and meteorologists . 
  watch out for the sea level tho ... 
  not to mention nowadays french people come from everywhere to work in paris lol . 
  oh trust me , i agree with that point of view . 
  i guess for many it 's easier to point at something outside their reach than their own . 
  it 's stupid because they 're otherwise howling at our government while not batting an eye at this law . 
  the french agency is known for its awesomeness and spectacular fails , it 's amusing . 
  but yeah , they do spy french people on a level that is hard to grasp for us common mortals . 
  however , i 'd wager that for most , it 's also a matter of not wanting his data handled by another country . 
  we 've already a hard time dealing with our own country , no need to add another on top of it . 
  at least , that 's how i see it for me . 
  but eventually , all of this is going to bite them in the arse , when everyone will crypto their mails and such . 
  it will get much more difficult for them to catch the real deal then . 
  sadly they do n't seem to get this . 
  i wonder how many people must handle all that data . 
  must be gigantic , even with automation handling most of it . 
  but that 's the point , french and spanish have very close grammar and rules . 
  both are extremely close in how they work , as language , it 's not only being a roman language . 
  i ca n't quite describe my reaction when i read the news : it was between `` that 's why the unions wanted crimes made during a protest left out in peace , right ? '', 
  `` welp , that 's what you get when unions block everything that can save a company '' `` ahahah , air france ! '', 
  and `` oh god , * not again ! * '' . 
  all of these at once * shrugs *, 
  for a french person it 's very easy to learn . 
  i do n't think he quite realise how close spanish and french are !, 
  i agree , better do it yourself with better beans : /, 
  normally in french we do n't put dots , we 'd write something like 152 000 $ like this . 
  typically , some people do n't want to live in the country they were born in , they do n't feel `` at home '' so to speak , so it 's not really surprising one would show up from time to time . 
  it depends where it 's located . 
  if it 's nowhere-land , it 'll cost shit . 
  we 're not a parisian or even big town level there . 
  these may be evaluations of the property done by different people ( accredited to , normally ) . 
  so , if i were op , i 'd definitely try to look how much is a property in the area the house is being sold because some of those people can be arses and would want to cheat and get it undervalued for another patron . 
  it has happened in the past . 
  if you do n't know the property , ask for pictures of it , to see the general state too , it can help evaluating . 
  also welcome to the state 's tax !, 
  you 're going to find the rules * hard * if your great aunt is n't in direct lineage with the deceased person ( basically , parents , or representing parents ) . 
  i 'm probably going to get downvoted for it , but as one of my friends actually sells coffee beans and as per my so who looked up into it , it looks that we , europeans , have a good base for coffee , but to find really great coffee , it 's really hard . 
  very few caf\u00e9s / bars actually focus on great beans which makes coffee very flavourful . 
  we like bitter coffee , but coffee has many flavours that are mostly lost on us , since we do n't know them . 
  too much concrete and building in this particular area ( i know it well , i go there every year ) instead of trees and land , so the ground can not absorb the water like it should . 
  not saying it 's all due to that , but yeah , it does play a role . 
  add to that an especially hot mediterranean sea as said above , and you get these deadly storms . 
  there are 5 major branchs in buddhism , so your mileage may vary . 
  but usually , celibacy are vows you take * aside * being a monk , and you can even give them back * and still be a monk * as far as i know ( and i 've been buddhist my whole life , but since there are different buddhisms , what applies to the ones i know may be different elsewhere , so i 'm not saying it 's 100 % sure ) .
