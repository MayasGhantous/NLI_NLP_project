yeah the difference in french is huge , `` comprendre '' can be used in different ways , either as `` trying to understand things '' or `` sharing their feelings '' . 
  taubira was saying how we should try to understand * why * some people turn their back on france and join a terrorist group so we can fight the roots of radicalization and terrorism but le pen twisted it in a way that makes taubira seems like she actually agrees with their reasons to become terrorists . 
  it 's like ... `` what happened ? 
  why did they become terrorists ? '', 
  versus `` they 're right , france turned its back on them first so we ca n't expect them not to kill us '', 
  i know nothing about uk politics , it was more of a joke but i mean , politicians in france are a bit scary , not lunatics-lunatics but when you look at the sheer amount of responsibility they have , the consequences of their actions on a few decades and how far from reality they are , yeah , that 's not reassuring . 
  for those who like old movies , i talked about it in the arte thread but watch [ arsenic and old lace ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036613/ ) by frank capra if you can , that movie is hilarious . 
  mortimer ( played by cary grant ) just got married and goes back home to tell his two aunts about it before going on his honeymoon when he discovers a body hidden in the living room and confronts his aunts about it . 
  it 's basically two hours of pure madness , despite most of the thing taking place in one room ( it 's an adaptation from a broadway play iirc ) , i could barely breathe between two over-the-top dialogues or crazy situations . 
  i want to forget about ours so bad i 've started watching the new stephen colbert show on the us primaries , it 's such a clusterfuck it does n't even feel real , makes me forget how bad the french ones will be . 
  he did such a great job for the 2012 ones i wonder why i even stopped watching his shows , his delivery is amazing but let 's be honest , the jokes write themselves , the shit * their * candidates say ... :d, 
  think of france , do we vote for the ones who have n't delivered on their promises and are at a record-low approval rating , the ones who were so terrible and corrupted hollande won the elections simply by not being sarkozy , one of the old washed-up politicians who are stuck in the 70s , the coo-coo leftists who are stuck in carebear land , the fascits who lie through their teeth on a daily basis and have no real experience or the center if there were still enough of them left around to call their group a ` party ' ? 
  shh , that 's france 's secret , we criticize something at a national level then push europe to do the exact opposite we `` want '' so we can reap the benefits ( hmm those juicy contracts ) while europe takes the blame for it , 
  must be great being a voter for the uk , unless you approve of the current government , do you renew people you do n't like or vote for the lunatics ? 
  ah , and they laughed at france 's lack of credible politician , now we have one more thing in common : being horrified about how the next elections will play out . 
  ` shadow chancellor ' is a great title though but you 'd think a shadow ... anything , really , would want more weapons for the police , not less . 
  absolutely , arte might sometimes show some weird shit but they also give a chance to lesser known but great tv shows and some amazing movies , their documentaries are also really interesting . 
  also , just because it looks weird does n't mean it 's bad , i 'm often really glad i watched something that ... did n't really seem interesting at first or that i 'd never have looked for on my own , the [ arsenic and old lace ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036613/ ) movie they showed this week a few times was hilarious . 
   this is about the amount of attention people pay . 
  this is the amount of attention people are told to pay or what is the most profitable for the media . 
  french media often have a couple of teams per region , one per major country , sometimes one person is an `` expert '' for many channels compared to 5-10 teams spread all over france . 
  would you say the same if you or any of your close friends , or hell , one of your children was killed in an attack ? 
  oh well , who cares , shit happens . 
  westerners are aware of non-westerners , terrorist attacks get some coverage but not enough due to how dangerous sending our journalists there is and how often it happens as well as how different those people are from us . 
  they should put the names and location of all their agents ( and those working for other networks ! ), 
  on a single usb key and name it ` skyfall ' , it worked very well for the mi5 in that one james bond movie, 
  is n't it `` illegal '' ? 
  i seem to remember some ex-muslims mentioning that death is the punishment for those who leave the religion so even if he avoided some crazy honor killings , his family would probably try to distance themselves from him if they 're somewhat religious . 
   but also to president holland 's explanation that the attacks in paris `` were conceived and planned in syria , and organized in belgium '' was hollande wrong though ? 
  if the whole group stayed in molenbeek before carrying out the attacks in paris then he was simply stating the truth . 
  otherwise , not sure why belgium is officially complaining about the remarks of a former ... anything really , a former employee only speaks for himself . 
  french tv said the same tonight , the * la d\u00e9fense * business district ( biggest one in europe ) was their next target but they also arrested people at the * roissy * airport ( maybe to see if someone was planning to plant a bomb amongst the luggages ? 
  that airport was well-known for shitty workers stealing stuff from luggages a few years ago so it 's just reverse-stealing i guess ) . 
  it 's also worrying because they might have information on the tactics used by our special forces and give a training on par with what has been provided to them back home . 
  they already have veterans from the afghan / iraq / balkan wars so i 'd expect them to be somewhat competent but it 's a shame to see those who swore to defend our country betray their fellow citizens . 
  does n't look like they 're using a truk , is it on rails ? 
  if it was n't made of stone , we [ could just move it away to a safer place ] ( https://bluenred.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/house-move1.jpg ), 
  it only works in english though because the same quote in french is :  '' ** le ** terrorisme ne d\u00e9truira pas la r\u00e9publique , car c'est la r\u00e9publique qui ** le ** d\u00e9truira '' terrorism is a masculine noun , r\u00e9publique is a feminine one and the second `` le '' can thus only refer to terrorism . 
  you english people and your non-gendered language !, 
  yeah read an article about it yesterday , seems like two have been arrested and the driver committed suicide so stupid , i mean he almost killed an innocent and destroyed his own future , all for nothing because attacking an innocent to take revenge for the death of other innocent people who have been killed by people totally unrelated to that poor man is really not clever . 
  so much for giving millions to the palestinian , welcoming arafat with open arms whenever he was sick , helping the investigation around his death and pushing for palestine to be recognized . 
  hell , the israelo-palestinian conflict is probably one of the major causes of the rise of anti-semitism in france ( because the greatest way to say how much you hate assholes attacking innocent people is to attack innocent people yourself ) because we have often sided with the palestinian . 
  not limited to middle eastern universities , went to the uk with a lot of chinese students and only a couple of them got failed when the vast majority of them could n't mutter two words in english . 
  they were nice people , did n't cause trouble , somewhat helpful when they actually understood what you asked but seeing them graduate makes the rest of us laugh a lot, 
   they need our help . 
  they ca n't support themsleves . 
  they do n't know anything . 
  they need permanent help , they 'll never be able to take care of themselves . 
  it always reminds me of [ the noble savage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noble_savage ) , not because they are but in the way some people look at them : they can do no wrong , they do n't know any better when they cause trouble , we have a lot to learn from them , people we look down upon yet look up to because they are uncorrupted by civilization , but we are terrible terrible people if we do n't do everything we can to accomodate to them . 
  truth is , they 're people , like us , most of them are trying to build their life in accordance to the way they 've been taught stuff and a minority of them are huge assholes who can pose a threat to our civilization ( but since we ca n't talk about them in fear of oppressing the others , we 'll let them ruin both our lives and those of other migrants ) . 
   he has planned some serious raising of recruitments on justice , police , penitenciary departments , reenforcement of army reservist 's services , etc. . . ( angela will dislike this , all budget restrictions since 10 years blew up , now ... ) ca n't wait to see sarkozy 's answer on this matter since he was the one who slashed budgets on almost all these things , closing courts of justice left and right , replacing policemen with fucking cameras of all things , imposing quota on policemen so they could bring in more money ( but investigate less what actually mattered ) , failed to build enough prisons and renovate existing ones ( some are so awful the eu fined us ) , wrecked havoc in the organization of our intelligence services and slashed army budgets too !, 
  hollande probably did n't do much better but seeing sarkozy parade on tv and criticize the left for the results of his mandate ( who went to libya , overthrew that madman but left them fight for the throne ? ), 
  is pretty awful . 
  i do n't even understand how the defense budget can be part of reforms aimed at reducing the deficit , the army , the thing that makes our country a sovereign nation , the thing that makes us not dead people , yeah , kinda important . 
  not saying we should waste money on useless military projects but our security is n't just a series of numbers an accountant can manipulate . 
  sure , i do n't know about other countries though but i 'm sure there are a lot of differences between fleming and walloon or italian in differences regions ( were n't they all different kingdoms at some point ? 
  ) , between different countries belonging to the uk or between the parts of switzerland that speak french , german and italian . 
  just saying that we ca n't talk about an european culture when talking about a national culture is already an exageration , 
  although we share the same language all over metropolitan france , i would n't even say that there is an homogeneous french culture . 
  we 're at the crossroads between spain , italy , switzerland , luxembourg , belgium , germany and the united kingdom is right next to us , we 've been at war with pretty much everyone in europe and it has heavily influenced us ... visit the pays basque in the south-west and alsace in the north-east of france , it 's almost a different country . 
   what guarantee does a certain side have that the other side will not just start exploiting the new vulnerability of the opposing side . 
  oh great , they want to settle things peacefully , they must be on the backfoot , time to press our advantage !, 
  yeah that was terrible but on the other hand , if people hate each other 's guts so much they can not stand living in the same country and start killing each other after a couple of decades , maybe letting them set up their own country would have also ended in wars , a different kind of wars ( between nation-states ) but wars nonetheless . 
  criminal , well-know by police services , known radical with ties to some terrorist organizations , goes abroad to train and/or fight for said terrorist organization , comes back ... oh well , we 'll monitor him for a couple of weeks and might put him under house arrest . 
  cars , you are also in control , you 're driving , it 's your car , you depend on your skills and your reaction time to avoid a potential accident and you drive often enough that even if you get into a light accident once or twice , you have a lot of memories of being in a car and not being in an accident . 
  planes , unless you take them often enough , you see horrible crashes on tv more often that you actually use one , and you have to leave your life in the hands of a total stranger doing things you ca n't understand , hoping those on the ground properly did their job maintaining a machine you know nothing of . 
  terrorism is so random and so awful , could be anyone , anywhere , at any time , you statistically have low changes of being the victim of a terrorist attack but you are 100 % sure that someone is plotting to carry out one somewhere and that people will die . 
  also , people use the low amount of terrorist attacks as proof to say we should n't worry too much and maybe spend less on intelligence services but the people protecting us are the only reason they 're not common occurences . 
  does it matter if they are french or not if they are able to come back from syria through the refugee camps ? 
  nobody said all refugees were dangerous but if dangerous elements are amongst the refugees the camps , then letting them come in and free to go wherever they want creates a dangerous situation . 
  most well-known example is the * la villeneuve * district in grenoble , there is a good documentary called * la villeneuve , l'utopie malgr\u00e9 tout * about it but i doubt there is a subbed version . 
  but it 's basically the story of most no-go zones , they did n't mix rich and poor but they did mix white and foreigners in some places and the only reasons foreigners are living together in ghettos is that a small minority is ruining everyone 's lives and the state does n't give a shit about it so everyone who could afford moving is already long gone , see [ molenbeek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sint-jans-molenbeek ) in belgium . 
  also i was in a ngo ( association ? ), 
  teaching middle-school kids before they final exam that leads them to high school and their school was so crap every family who could afford it put their kids somewhere else , white people and non-white people alike ( which sometimes means cheating and pretending you 're living somewhere else as you are supposed to go to a certain public school depending on where you live ), 
  there were a few utopian neighborhoods where migrants and natives were supposed to live in peace in france , turns out they ruined the lives of so many people everyone but migrants got out of this mess , leaving only those who cause trouble and the migrants poor enough that they could n't afford to leave the place . 
  as usual , not being tough enough on a few individuals who caused problems for fear of looking racist or ruining their lives ended up ruining many more lives , migrants included . 
  firecrackers in a wedding this morning frightened quite a few people , hopefully it 's another prank or stupid idiot totally oblivious to the situation, 
  prioritizing short-term profits ( let 's cut all expenses ! ), 
  over long-term costs ( healthcare/insurance costs for wounded and their families/friends , death of productive members of society , lower morale , feeling of insecurity , cancelled events , worsened reputation that attracts less investors and tourists ) ... sounds like your politicians pretty much think like ours . 
  blaming others is an important skill for politicians , ever heard of the tobin tax on financial transactions ? 
  it was an important part of hollande 's campaign in 2012 and a law everyone supposedly supported . 
  god were we surprised when we discovered that at brussels , france was the one country opposing the law the strongest and our representatives doing their best to get it cancelled , including people who were defending it at home . 
  works the other way around to , some people blame brussels for forcing unpopular laws on us but oh , hey , seems like their party largely supported it at the eu parliament . 
  politics ... x ), 
  yeah , i remember the french government telling the uk they were n't doing enough to help the refugees stuck in calais at the france  england border while telling italy that refugees stuck at the italy  france border were n't our problems and that we would n't let them pass . 
  it was quite something to witness , not sure they even realized the stupidity of the whole thing . 
  dunno , they showed seconds of the videos on tv ( tf1 ) and said whoever was hanging from the window was ok but there is a lot of confusion . 
  our government was heavily criticized for jumping on orban for trying to follow the law and for siding with merkel who had clearly no idea what she was doing . 
  i do n't like this orban character and some things he says are ridiculous but he was right , many said so at the time , myself included . 
  edit : taking in some refugees and spreading them over europe with a clear plan in mind , proper funding and laws taking into consideration how to deal with those who do n't integrate is one thing , throwing away the laws and telling everyone to come in is madness so i guess i only partly agree with him . 
  i meant fleeing from war zones and not just coming from poor countries looking for a better life ( not that i do n't understand why they 're coming here ) . 
  also , they have to understand that a refugee can not choose the country he 'll live in , it 's a temporary solution and we have to spread them all over europe , if they 're not happy about it or move to another country , deport them back right outside europe . 
  if they cause trouble , same , you 're supposed to be a victim from persecution , not the one persecuting people so refugees fighting amongst themselves , spreading hate , attacking citizens , out . 
  lebanon and turkey already house plenty of refugees , right ? 
  if they have safe empty zones then we should set up camps there but let 's be honest , we should also financially support those camps , some countries do ( uk spends a lot actually , right ? ), 
  and some just pretend it 's not their problem until they start knocking at their door . 
   can stay in camps whether it 's in france or in safe zones in the middle east and economic migrants are to be sent back home if they are out of work for more than 3 months . 
  the calais camp is n't an official camp , it 's people setting up tents near the france-uk border without authorization , without help from the state , without proper infrastructure , you think we ca n't do better ? 
   another great idea , comparing canada which is separated from any migrantion source by ocean/usa to europe we ca n't stop them from coming in but we can send them out ( ex : to refugee camps set up in the middle east , providing both them and us some safety ) . 
  they probably wo n't , because moving the event would tell extremists that they 're right and carrying out attacks on our territory is a good way to change our leaders decisions .
