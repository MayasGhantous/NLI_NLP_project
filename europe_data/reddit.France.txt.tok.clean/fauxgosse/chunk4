  gdp growth alone is not an adequate measure of economic success . 
  the other day i saw a tv report on 24/7 kindergardens in the us where working parents could leave their children . 
  sorry , but a place where the financially lower end of society has 2 + jobs to keep themselves alive can not be considered economically successful in my view . 
  what is so terrible ? 
  let 's take the new watt limit on hoovers . 
  not at all a crazy brussels regulation , it immediately led to new hoovers that are just as good but more eco friendly . 
  you 're growing well because you keep lowering social standards . 
  low-paid shitjobs do n't make a country prosperous , they make only the rich people in a country prosperous . 
  the european commission does n't make the big decisions . 
  the european council does . 
  the truth is : the north of europe led by germany dominates it . 
  i 'm against merkel and the german government in most economic issues as well , ** but ** it 's totally wrong to say that germany is dictating policies for the zone euro . 
  pretty much the entire north of europe supports the same stuff . 
  finland , netherlands , austria , the new belgium government probably too . 
  just leave the union . 
  right to cap eu migration is utter bullshit . 
  why should the uk get all the economic benefits and not take on the full responsibilities ? 
  * were not `` have been '' . 
  it 's not fine . 
  the only reason we accept european courts ruling over national courts is because we have accepted the eu as a governmental layer that we are part of . 
  i wo n't accept an investment court in washington . 
  european governments should be responsible only to their own people and the european institutions . 
  then they are out of luck . 
  we live in democracies and selling kebabs is not an inalienable right granted by the constitution . 
  it 's an investment . 
  it involves what we call ** `` risk '' ** . 
  the fact that nuclear energy and germany are n't a match made in heaven is n't exactly news . 
  vattenfall invested in nuclear energy in one of the most anti-nuclear energy countries in the world . 
  when the german government decided to end nuclear energy they started suing because their investments were going to shit . 
  investment = risk . 
  if that principle is n't valid anymore then the whole system breaks apart . 
  in this case every 6 year old with an internet connection could have foreseen germany banning nuclear energy . 
  we like spain a lot . 
  we admire germany . 
  we ridicule ( but also love ) belgium . 
  we laugh at italy . 
  living outside the motherland we are forced to adapt to defy the harsh conditions . 
  they ca n't all be as linguistically gifted as us . 
  homosexuality was n't a crime in germany until 1994 , that would be insane . 
  it was decriminalised by the socialists in the 70s and as far as i know the only difference in 1994 was a higher age of consent for homos . 
  girl is very drunk , lies on bed . 
  you start undressing her , she mumbles some incomprehensible stuff . 
  you fuck her , she does n't say anything . 
  that 's perfectly fine in your mind , yes ? 
  so as long as the woman does n't fight back when you fuck her it 's okay and ca n't be rape ? 
  is that what you meant by `` feminists invented this retarded concept '' ? 
  what a remarkably british response . 
  order over culture . 
  can we trade the nobel prize for 3 % gdp growth ? 
  ... what ? 
  the pitiful pun would n't have worked . 
  i do n't know ... lately there have been a few too many russian answers . 
  too bad our holland is n't even a real holland . 
  yay another tiny tax haven . 
  the uk has a real shortage of those and needs a few more . 
  i agree . 
  the only thing i 'd like to add is that sometimes it 's worth defending certain industries even it involves paying a bit more . 
  there 's more to life than price and efficiency . 
  this is what my friend taught me :d . 
  it 's a moral dilemma , i know . 
  but self-awareness about the fact that we were all just lucky and nothing more is important in my opinion . 
  you have to be aware to change even a little bit for the better . 
  that 's the middle ground and we are capable of it . 
  i deal with people not religions . 
  as long as i am treated well i do n't care what they do at home . 
  i grew up in a huge m\u00e9tropole and i 'm even part of a minority ( homo ) . 
  yet somehow i never really had a problem with these `` horrors '' of mass immigration . 
  i wonder why . 
  for historical reasons that 's not * quite * a good example , do n't you think ? 
  holy shit this is the top comment . 
    europe should stop all of these appallingly expensive rescues . 
  who cares about people , just let them die . 
  i ca n't believe this shit . 
  do you think you have any greater justification to live in europe than any of those africans ? 
  you do n't . 
  you were simply lucky . 
  you do n't deserve it any more than others . 
    what a disgusting and vile remark . 
  thank god people like you are too scared to say stuff like that in real life . 
    ** naturally ** italy 's situation is different and we 're going to respect the 3 % limit that we 've been imposed . '', 
  naturellement . 
  * yes , naturally . 
  i remember when france voted no because ps was divided like a club of clowns . 
  laurent fabius ( on the right of ps ) advertised for no to appeal to the left wing of ps for future party leadership elections . 
  he is a cheap asshole . 
  the left were against it despite being pro eu because it was deemed neoliberal and ps being the idiots they are thought they could get a better deal if they voted no . 
  sorry for being bitter but french politics are bitter . 
  yeah that was what i intended to say . 
  and in france the best institutions of tertiary education are not necessarily universities but the grandes \u00e9coles . 
  i do n't see those on any of the lists either . 
  the charts are heavily biased towards the anglo-saxon university/research model . 
  for example : how are the french grandes \u00e9coles represented ? 
  what about the fact a large part of german research happens at fraunhofer institutes ? 
  i like it !, 
  at least he is consistent in his arseholeishness . 
  makes it easy to judge him . 
  i dont understand . 
  why are there so many people doing it ? 
  i doubt it . 
  try water in the hot places in spain .
