  that has chlorine . 
  and you ca n't drink it . 
  the dutch `` tasty tom '' tomatoes i get in aldi are better than many of the expensive tomatoes i bought in france . 
  sure , meat is disgraceful , but vegetables etc. 
  or the french cheeses at aldi are n't bad at all . 
  there is good and bad . 
  aldi is certainly not a shop with only `` low quality '' ingredients . 
  is this some kind of extension that automatically translates french into english ? 
  most taxes are uniform in germany . 
  corporation tax is taken by local communities . 
  however the german government passed a law requiring a minimum corporation tax rate after 0 % in some communities . 
  that would be a big step forward in europe . 
  at least a minimum rate . 
  interesting . 
  i do n't think that unsuccessful states should try to be successful with extremely low corporation tax . 
  purposefully not mentioning france ... germany has vastly different economic circumstances between its regions . 
  yet there are fixed national taxes .

  without him it 's -1 . 
  there 's different phases that people and countries go through in regards to homosexuality . 
  hatred and persecution homophobia but `` do n't ask do n't tell '' and you 'll live . 
  acceptance . 
  guess where you are . 
  please tell me you do n't live in europe . 
  in that case it would be your democratic duty to allow your fellow gay citizens the same rights as yourself ( since you do n't care about gays marrying ) in a theoretical referendum . 
  which means you picked a side . 
  putin should play some eu4 and learn about overextension . 
  like what ? 
  how are they second class citizens ? 
  enlighten me . 
  finance the program with a progressive tax then not a flat amount for everyone . 
  it 's antisocial . 
  hollande  orban, 
  beautifully put and exactly right . 
  399 + rent + health care . 
  you did n't mention that . 
  huge difference . 
  i do n't want to reintegrate someone who cut off the head of a living person . 
  yeah , how awful of us to want to lock up these people . 
  people who do stuff like this http://syrianfight.com . 
  warning do n't click if you ca n't handle horrible pictures !, 
  then please explain to me why karel de gucht openly says in an interview that `` the americans are insisting on isds , so it has to be in '' . 
  it does n't quite make sense , you know ? 
  several high ranking european politicians have voiced opposition against isds , but it stays in because ** america ** insists on it . 
  karel de gucht , trade commissioner , says so . 
  also , i do n't god damn care whether european companies use it . 
  it should n't exist . 
  energy companies should n't be able to sue a government for leaving atomic energy . 
  i know that happened in the ue but it 's an argument against the principle in general . 
  investment involves risk . 
  they could have researched about the german position on atomic energy beforehand . 
  ... what ? 
  they speak spanish together ? 
  why ? 
  every government is shit ? 
  looking at the standard of living in europe it ca n't be that bad . 
  yay, 
  there is a special weird relationship there because nazi germany supported the idea of ukrainian nationhood against the soviet union . 
  that 's why this is so easily connected to fascists in germany . 
  we did n't topple the government of ukraine . 
  the people did . 
  and no matter what ... russia can sue/embargo/sanction / insult the eu but it absolutely can not invade another sovereign country and steal its territory . 
   but , here 's my problem with it : this happens always and by ( almost ) every other nation , especially the eu and us . 
  i can not believe that we are the poor victims here . 
  show me one example of a western country annexing territory in the last 50 years . 
  it does n't happen . 
  i think it comes from ( 1 ) anti-americanism and ( 2 ) a feeling of guilt and responsibility towards russia becase of ww2 . 
  many germans will say ` we bear guilt towards russia ' but tend to forget that atrocities committed in ukraine and poland especially were at least as bad . 
  and many underestimate for example the polish experience of ww2 . 
  being attacked and fucked up by two powerful dictatorships that collaborated together . 
  projects such as nordstream have a great psychological effect in many central-eastern european countries today because of exactly this reason . 
  i do n't want to justify the french occupation of half of europe ... however i do want to mention that the code civil ( also known as napoleonic code ) was a major step forward in the judicial/political developments of many regions . 
  it brought some of the core principles of the revolution to the occupied territories . 
  it greatly expanded and guaranteed civil rights : personal freedom , respect for personal property and contractual freedom . 
  one can also mention separation of the judiciary from the administration . 
  the right to a defendant/attorney . 
  separation of church and state and religious tolerance . 
  abolition of absolutist structures and feudalism . 
  there definitely were some positive effects . 
  of course i do n't want to whitewash napoleon completely . 
  it would just be wrong to see it as a one-sided oppression . 
  the asterisks exist for you and denmark . 
  the flag is beautiful . 
  why can the uk deport and ban him while ireland ca n't ? 
  surely there is a flaw in the system there . 
  also , instead of being banned from entry , he should be in a locked mental institution . 
  it worked kinda well for the germans . 
  they used that freedom to improve their economy . 
  france just did n't bother . 
  she hates him so much [ she ** campaigned for him ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zezpydh.jpg ) to become ec president . 
  and here is the source of the picture . 
  my german is n't great but google translate can tell you what ` wahlkampf ' means . 
   friday 23 may -- saarlouis , germany  agenda :  jean-claude juncker participates in a campaign event of the christian democratic union ( cdu ) with chancellor angela merkel .

  i registered in spain around 2007 i think . 
  so it 's actually 7 not 8 years . 
  in spain you go to the police and give them an address . 
  it involved hours and hours of waiting though . 
  you get a green paper .
