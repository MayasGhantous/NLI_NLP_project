  i could easily do my driver 's license there . 
  i actually got two election slips this year , france and spain , but i decided to do the right thing and only vote in france . 
  i do n't know what kind of socialism they mean but it definitely is not the marxist socialism ( otherwise known as ` real ' socialism ) . 
  a more descriptive title would probably have been `` young people favour a more regulated market over a free market '' . 
  that 's not socialism though . 
  i 've been a resident of spain and france at the same time for the past 8 years or so . 
  they do n't check . 
  it 's european union law . 
  and has been at the core of eu law since at least the 60s . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/legislation/handbook_vol_1_en.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_competition_law, 
  i know what the invisible hand is . 
  it 's the description of a process wherein the actions of an individual seeking greater personal profit in a free market system benefit society as a whole . 
  competition etc. 
  further and more careful inspection of my post will reveal to you that at no time did i deny its existence . 
  instead i think i relatively clearly implied that the central mistake of free market liberals is not to recognise its * absence * . 
  this is the core problem . 
  the invisible hand exists , but not absolutely . 
  thus government intervention is sometimes necessary . 
  the birthplace of social democracy . 
  everyone who bet against the euro failed so far . 
  social democracy is not a strawman fallacy . 
  economic systems are n't black and white . 
   the uk ** almost ** constitutes a federal system in itself, 
  i never meant to say that it 's a full blown federal system . 
  hence the `` almost '' in my initial comment . 
  however it is decentralised enough for scottish unis not to have 9000 pound fees . 
  i think that 's quite significant . 
  you ignored that . 
  his comment clearly implied brits did n't like the idea of a federal eu because of their dislike of federalism . 
  that is * exactly * what i addressed . 
  so then the mali intervention showed the world how capable the eu is in a swift and successful military operation ? 
  albania is on the balkans you twat . 
  it 's more west than greece . 
  well , but the vast majority support a moderate capitalist system where the government intervenes when the market fails . 
  not a socialist system . 
  and neoliberals/market-liberals usually do n't want the government to intervene at all . 
  or far too little . 
  people are upset about the notion that the market is this magical thing that universally produces the best results by itself . 
  antitrust laws should be much harsher than they currently are . 
  the reason being that the uk benefits from the euro currency union by keeping the exchange rate of countries like italy and france stable and relatively high through the inclusion of countries like netherlands and germany . 
  any currency union is ` artificial ' . 
  the euro does n't `` artificially depress the price of [ germany 's ] goods '' . 
  it merely puts countries with different productivity together and economies built on sand and fragile credit are at a disadvantage . 
  nothing in financial politics is * natural * . 
  all currencies are imagined constructs . 
  you could say `` italy artificially devalued its currency for decades '' . 
  they are both sentences devoid of real meaning . 
  the reason they are used is to imply a certain moral judgement . 
  artificial sounds bad and makes it seem like it 's all a cunning plan to destroy southern europe . 
  in fact it is the opposite . 
  loooooooong before the euro we had something called the exchange rate mechanism . 
  it was meant to reduce currency fluctuations in europe . 
  countries could only devalue so much . 
  why did we do this ? 
  because heavily fluctuating currency exchange rates are bad for ( 1 ) the common market and ( 2 ) the people . 
  one of the most important goals of the eu is to create equal standards of living . 
  that does n't work if governments in the south keep using devaluation as a means to solve their economic fuckups . 
  your graphs are useless . 
  they have different scales ... 
  the gbp graph intervalls are double that of the euro graph . 
  that 's why the movements seem so much greater . 
  makes the euro look more fragile than it is . 
  in reality they are much closer . 
  it is ? 
  the euro is not unstable . 
  here are some graphs from mid 2008 ( before crisis ) to today . 
  they show the relationship between the us dollar/yen to both euro and pound sterling . 
  the larger the white area between the euro and the gbp , the greater the disparity between both currencies . 
  you can see that both us dollar and yen appreciate more against the euro than against the sterling at the height of the euro crisis . 
  not in enormous amounts though . 
  they are both stable and have similar exchange rate movements . 
  portuguese is spoken all around the world ? 
  that 's a bit generous i think . 
  cookies of war . 
  nice source by the way . 
  `` ron paul institute '' . 
  there is a need for a lot more economic integration . 
  that 's the reform the euro-zone really needs . 
  not some vague deregulation announcement . 
  people like you will always find a way to make the us/the west responsible for every bad thing that happens in the world . 
  let me guess , it was all a cunning plan to suppress european power by turning them against russia . 
  to establish the precedent of the european parliament choosing the ec president . 
  hence i called it `` almost '' a federal system . 
  significant powers were devolved to more local forms of government but the constitutional power does indeed derive from the central authority in the uk . 
  that 's correct . 
  the us is n't the only and almighty definition of a federal state . 
  for example you have some tax powers and the power to run your universities very differently from england . 
  these are not signs of centralism . 
  ah , the ` political compass ' . 
  in my opinion it is extremely biased and skewed in so many areas that it does n't produce accurate results at all . 
  there is a lot to criticise , but i 'll make two main points based on what i perceive to be factual errors . 
   [ the chart also makes clear that , despite popular perceptions , the opposite of fascism is not communism but anarchism \\ ( ie liberal socialism \\ ) , and that the opposite of ** communism ( i.e. 
  an entirely state-planned economy ) ** is neo-liberalism ( i.e. 
  extreme deregulated economy ) ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2 ) in what world is communism a `` state-planned economy '' ? 
  communism is common ownership of the means of production ( ` the economy ' ) with the simultaneous ** absence of the state ** as well as any form of class . 
  the entire idea of the ` state ' in marxism is for it to be the tool that allows the working class to exert control over society ( = socialism , the famous `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' ) . 
  communism is the absence of classes and therefore the abolition of the ` state ' . 
  if you do n't believe me in this , here is marx commenting on the `` necessary '' transition from socialism to communism :  [ [ ... ] ( 2 ) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat ; [ and ] ( 3 ) that this dictatorship , itself , constitutes no more than a transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dictatorship_of_the_proletariat#karl_marx ) 2 . 
  in fact equating communism , socialism and marxism with ` left wing ' is outright ignorant . 
  wikipedia gives a better definition of ` left wing ' :  [ in left-right politics , left-wing politics are political positions or activities that accept or ** support social equality ** , often in opposition to social hierarchy and social inequality .
