  it is typically justified on the basis of ** concern for those ** in society ** who are perceived as disadvantaged ** relative to others and an assumption that there are ** unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced ** or abolished . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-wing_politics ) equating ` right wing ' with ` neoliberalism ' is very questionable as well . 
  right - and left-wing are not economic ideologies but different ways of looking at society . 
  from that different economic ideologies are created . 
  social democracy is not more or less ` left-wing ' than ( real ) socialism , they are merely different ways of engaging the same problem ( = social inequality ) . 
  i should understand this since i speak german . 
  i do n't though . 
  explain ? 
  the treaty of maastricht consolidated several european integration efforts under the new name ` european union ' . 
  i 'm guessing your argument is that the european communit ** ies ** ( of which there were more than one ) were not of political nature and only the integration of ` common foreign and security policy ' and ` police and judicial cooperation ' turned the eu into a political project . 
  quite objectively false . 
  the european communities were more than just the european economic community . 
  the most obvious example being the european coal and steel community . 
  its only raison d'\u00eatre was to ensure peace between france and germany by unifying production . 
  purely political . 
  in fact even the european economic community was political . 
  it was specifically not a free trade zone . 
  we established supranational executive , judicial and later legislative institutions to watch over the implementation of common rules . 
  today they are known as european commission , european court of justice and european parliament . 
  they are the direct descendants of the institutions of the european communities . 
  well , i support being honest regarding the eu . 
  british politicians should tell the british people where the eu has clearly been headed for the last decades . 
  if you guys then vote to leave it would make me a bit sad but ultimately it 's for the best . 
  clearly the british do n't dislike federalism that much . 
  you 're very much against centralism . 
  i do n't think you would like the french system . 
  are you seriously trying to argue the eu came into existence with the treaty of maastricht in 1993 ? 
  that 's embarrassing . 
  you gave scotland and wales so much self-governing power that the uk almost constitutes a federal system in itself . 
  except your overall budget is much smaller if you do it alone . 
  that 's why we commonly pool resources ... 
  that was an insult ?!, 
  how did you survive school ? 
  are you enjoying your completely arbitrary privilege of being born in europe ? 
  do you really feel so entitled to it that you can attack others for wanting something even remotely similar ? 
  or you know ... people with psychological problems who fall through the system because they 're not stable enough to use the welfare system . 
  do you think it 's more fun begging and sleeping on the streets than living in an apartment from the german welfare money ? 
  expect to be lied to every step of the way . 
  trust me , it 's the same thing in every country . 
  i used to be in the public health insurance system of spain through a completely normal job . 
  it took me months to get my tarjeta sanitaria europea ( european health insurance card ) . 
  they just refused to follow their own laws . 
  either `` this card is not for you , just for spanish people '' or `` in what country are you insured ? '' . 
  here in spain you dumb fuck , give me my card !, 
  i can also tell you some funny stories about getting a ` foreigners registration number ' ( nie ) and a tax number ( nif ) in spain . 
  nie involved me waiting for hours in the morning in front of the police station and then having them invent some bullshit reason why i could n't have it . 
  only got it after going again with a spanish friend . 
  however it 's still not that easy : while spanish people can pay the administration fee ( i think 9 euros ) in cash at the police station , foreigners have to pay the fee outside in a specified bank branch . 
  but that bank is not necessarily open at the same time . 
  and even if it is open , prepare to wait another 6 hours when you return to the police station . 
  or getting the famous `` certificado de registro de ciudadanos de la uni\u00f3n '' . 
  a green paper than you need for all kinds of stuff in spain as a foreigner . 
  they just did n't want to give it to me . 
  inventing reasons like ` we do n't have the paper in this building ' or ` the green paper does n't exist any more ' . 
  it took persistent attempts to get it . 
  as a foreigner you should take a native with you at every step . 
  preferably someone who knows about the laws . 
  lying to foreigners at these kinds of authorities is the standard way . 
  oh absolutely . 
  but he was employing a reductio ad absurdum saying that arguing with the udhr in one case means employing it globally and radically to everything . 
  as the terminology suggests , this is pretty absurd . 
  and i 'm saying that 40 years ago people would have said that if you use the universal declaration of human rights to justify gay rights , opponents would have answered : `` then you might as well use the udhr to justify incest and paedophilia ! '', 
  you say using the udhr to justify one call for equality means the udhr must absolutely and fundamentally apply to all things unequal . 
  yet you give no reason as to why one follows the other . 
  this is why your argument is non sequitur . 
  except that no law is as fundamentalist as you make it sound . 
  born free , equal in dignity and rights does not mean the law demands that every single detail in every life must be equal . 
  that 's why we have courts , lawyers , judges , politicians and parliaments . 
  to interpret the overarching principles ( constitution , human rights declaration , whatever ... ) into contemporary law . 
  equality for gay people was not considered as obvious 30 years ago as it is today . 
  society changes and reinterprets constantly . 
  to suggest the universal human rights declaration is a `` nice sounding platitude '' is quite ridiculous . 
  it 's one of the most significant documents ever written in human history and had a huge effect on politics around the world . 
  scandinavian languages are very close to each other . 
  italian and spanish are comparatively close as well . 
  you 're confirming my argument . 
  languages plays a highly significant part in culture . 
  british culture is much closer to american culture than to say spanish culture . 
  from literature to the jokes people tell on the street . 
  the culture is connected to the language and would n't be nearly as interesting and distinct without it . 
  that 's the mistake you make in my opinion . 
  i can discover the anglosphere too because i speak english . 
  it 's not hard learning other languages . 
  it would rob myself of the ability to discover new languages and enter one of those different worlds . 
  i maintain that thinking in different languages is not the same . 
  imagery and sayings of a language have an effect on what we imagine in our heads . 
  words have colour , form and imagery . 
  * insular * ? 
  they are like different spheres . 
  unique ways of writing , talking and most importantly thinking . 
  thinking in french is very different from thinking in english . 
  the english ` world ' is insular too - from the other worlds . 
  if everybody spoke english that would not give us all access to the ` outside world ' . 
  it would destroy ` outside ' . 
  an enormous catastrophic cultural and intellectual loss . 
  i learn other languages to have access to other worlds . 
  i do n't want everyone to speak my own . 
  this is it which stops us from being insular . 
  more strictness in regards to the republican and french values . 
  but at the same time more help and incentives to those that do well .
