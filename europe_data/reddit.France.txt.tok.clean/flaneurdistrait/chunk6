  i just find it a bit ironic that they 've got all the wallon characters speaking in english . 
  i suppose it does n't matter really . 
  the addition of the emoticon is top notch man  very stylistic . 
  bruxelles is a predominantly french speaking capital ; yet it 's all in in either dutch or english ? 
  sorry to disappoint , but in france , it 's all about integration and assimilation . 
  even le fn supports the idea that immigrants can become truly french when they properly assimilate . 
  this is the difference between close-minded immigration policy and that which is careful and thoughtful . 
  which you seem to be the former , which leads me to believe by chatting we wo n't really get anywhere . 
  many take a hard stance on issues like this though , like vals . 
  i 'm not saying i like some of le ps ' candidates ( in an ideal world , i 'd see faudot ; however mel\u00e9nchon appears to be the only feasible choice ) just that what you said is n't really true -- or at least more nuanced . 
  also ... the centre right does n't seem to exist in this election . 
  fillon is hard right ... harder than le pen at least . 
  true, 
  that 'd require the future tense i 'm afraid . 
   they depend on us for food `` france , whose farms export more agricultural food products than any other eu nation ( accounting for 22 % of the eu 's total agricultural output ) , is the only country in europe to be completely ** self-sufficient ** in basic food production ; '', 
  i do n't think being a patriot/nationalist means you have to hate foreigners , not to mention people with foreign ancestors . 
  it 's just about assimilation . 
  that said , its in popular culture to sideline nuance , so you see many of these `` patriots '' in le fn and outside of it simply being racists masquerading as legitimate politicians . 
  but i find it a bit hypocritical to attack him using the exact same bigoted rhetoric people lambast le fn for . 
  i mean , before you go you really need to know where you 're going , and understand the land and people . 
  i feel a lot of people overlook what it truly means to move . 
  it 's not as whimsical as it might seem at first glance . 
  not only is there a lot of bureaucracy involved but when there you need to respect the place you 're going to . 
  the world is your oyster for travelling , sure -- but living is different . 
  why is there always that one day out of the week when this sub is flooded with absolute garbage ? 
  * awaits the incoming `` tolerance !! '', 
  response , or another alt-right mock-buzzword *, 
  absolutely breathtaking . 
  not ancestry -- that 's not connected really . 
  what i meant was just in anglo countries . 
  it 's more so anglo imo . 
  you see it plenty in britain too . 
  the entirity of france did n't vote in the conservative primary you know , conservatives did . 
  saying it 's roots , over political reaction to a failing and inept president is i feel going through great hoops to reach a personal narrative . 
  also , it is telling of the level of comprehension of the nuance within the political sphere -- because despite her label as `` far-right '' she 's a lot more leftist in economic regards , and not as socially conservative as fillon ( for that , go to her niece ), 
  could it perhaps be a reaction to the failed socialist president and the fracture on the left ? 
  why does everything have to only fit nicely into * your * narrative . 
  removing nuance for that goal is pretty dishonest . 
  i 'd argue that the idea of the modern central france is more so founded on the ideals of la r\u00e9volution -- as it was n't till then that france really solidified into its own thing . 
  there is a case to be argued for heritage and localisms , but strictly speaking about the r\u00e9gime i have to disagree . 
  how very editorialised . 
  the friend was n't meant to be rude , nor do i think using fairly basic words is quasi-intellectual . 
  what would you rather me do , just say bad and shit all the time ? 
  i 've never really understood the hostility to using powerful words . 
  they mean more , and pack more of a punch than saying just `` terrible '' -- sorry i 'm not limiting myself to softer and less meaningful words ? 
  i do n't get your anger . 
  on your other point : i consider myself something akin to the ideals that came out of the french revolution . 
  this is n't about populism , friend . 
  no where did i say i had any problem with that , or the needs of the people . 
  in fact , my entire political ideology is * based * off of the state being the true voice of the citizenry and nation and the servant to the people 's needs . 
  my point , rather , was this is an abhorrent and disgusting website which should have no place in any decent society . 
  the fact that there can exist an article about placing women back into the home , by their foremost editor -- is appalling and grotesque . 
  this is depressing . 
  i hope that people realise their self-absorbed bigotry and mindlessness as the people across the atlantic have failed to do . 
  it 's a poor descriptor ; but you could also apply civic nationalist to it instead . 
  also , i believe it was more so the ethnic nationalism , which is a lot more bound by blood . 
  it 's also fairly irrelevant if you looked into what it is . 
  i feel like if there was a large recognition of le mouvement republican citoyen ( mrc ) with bastien faudot , which is like a souveraintist left party created by chev\u00e8nement then it could be competitive . 
  since that probably wo n't happen , i 'd say our best bet is m\u00e9lenchon, 
  i feel like this entire sub just sees europe as one similar place , where every country is mutually swappable . 
  it depends on where you want to go . 
  europe is n't a country . 
  it 's a continent and like any other incredibly diverse . 
  if you like europe , that 's cool -- but where in europe do you like is a part of that too . 
  if you 're planning to move there , you should be charmed enough by it to want to assimilate into the society and culture -- and apart of that is learning the language . 
  moving is a bigger concept than a lot of people give it credit for . 
  you really need to be sure if you 're ready to pick everything up and essentially become a different person . 
  it 's a pretty big jump ( i 'm not saying you 're not up to it or whatever , just wanted to add that in ), 
  not every policy change is about europe , my god . 
  he announced he 'd resign if it failed . 
  he made it about himself . 
  hopefully , she will be exiled . 
  you should cross post this in r/upliftingnews, 
  i try and believe that politics is a little bit more deep than realpolitiking and nothing else . 
  i 'm afraid important has in its roots the air of subjectivity . 
  also , do i need to quote it for you ? 
  the opening fact is nearly 90 % are named after men . 
  for half the population , that is the definition of over representation . 
   but not ** more ** important . 
  that 's subjective and quite frankly up to the people , not you . 
   so it should be based on fickle popularity ? 
  bieber st. here we come !, 
  this is just silly and dumb . 
  you 're assumption of fickle was just that , a baseless assumption . 
  streets are named after people who are important to the citizens and nation . 
  there is no basis for who is more important , nor is that the only way streets are named . 
   you say that , yet provide no evidence . 
  again , if they were more important in their own right , they would have already had streets named after them . 
  you did n't actually read the article , did you . 
  they are important and probably more liked and representative of who the spanish are than corrupt dictators . 
  they 're under represented and that 's a fact . 
  are important women not apart of a countries history and ancestry ? 
  good on them, 
  is this suggesting that they are looking to include the republic of \u00c9ire in the uk ? 
  maybe i 'm just misunderstanding this . 
  is this a copy pasta ? 
  it sure reads like one . 
  but i 'll address it as if you were really that dimwitted . 
  aside from the first sentence , because it has literally no bearing on anything i said . 
  actually .
