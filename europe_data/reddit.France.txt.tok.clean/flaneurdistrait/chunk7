  its hard to really analyse each bit and respond to it accordingly . 
  it 's all just compiled buzz words and phrases everyone uses no matter the situation . 
  but i 'll respond to the one part that actually took something more than a copy and paste key :  this is just sad . 
  lets bring the entire third world into europe , should solve all problems , right ? 
  i mean , who really cares if they are actual refugees or economic migrants breaking international law , right ? 
  i 'm afraid its not as black and white as you and your friends would like everyone to believe . 
  is that all of them ? 
  even if it were , sending them back is simply inhumane . 
  this is a situation were the extremes are more harm than good . 
  now , if you have an open mind , i 've got a great interesting documentary that changed my opinion on the matter too . 
  these people are human and once you do that you start to realise how personal this situation is . 
  [ here it is ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/topics/the-journey-from-syria-documentary ), 
  you 're a good man, 
  ah yes . 
  i love this rhetoric : claiming that everything effeminate is inherently bad , meanwhile being the same group to say sexism is solved . 
  it 's all so very funny and hypocritical . 
  also ... am i supposed to prefer the pawn of some bloodthirsty medieval tyrant over the one who seems to give a shit about human life ? 
  * and of course you 're from the hellhole that is * r/the _ donald, 
  it is n't required that the eu conglomerate into one country to have a joint military force and strong alliance . 
  like , at all . 
  can we stop with the `` its either one extreme or another ! '', 
  thatcherism makes my soul weep . 
  i also am wary of anyone who envies the english . 
  what a sad , sad man . 
  last couple weeks they 've been saying he 's rising . 
  most people think les r\u00e9publicains will take her out in the second round . 
  that said , macron could easily take away rightist and centrist votes . 
  not to mention the time left for just about anything to happen . 
  so we 'll see . 
  hoping for the left to improve though, 
  i have no doubt in my mind that whoever gets hold of green energy will have basically the next era of our world in their pocket . 
  the nearsightedness of the conservatives in the united states is not only worrying , but laughably stupid . 
  edit : corporate america is also fairly nearsighted too . 
  when it comes to the big ones , they 're more in it for easy and quick profit ( when you 're so entangled in corruption and shareholder-demanding its hard not to want that ) so i do n't really see them taking the leap without something to guide them . 
  what i enjoy most of all , is knowing that trump has put himself in the worst spot possible . 
  he 's managed to surround himself with climate change deniers ; however has to answer to a world which says otherwise . 
  it 's a lose-lose for him , hopefully he does n't make it an l for the world as well . 
  but i mean , it * could * give some solace seeing america slowly come to terms with the loss it incurred ignoring the huge burgeoning industry that is sustainable energy . 
  no problem . 
  thanks for being cool and cordial . 
  i 'll delete mine too . 
   but is bureaucracy really a problem ? 
  because all objective proof is that replacing 27 bureaucracies with one works . 
  is policy really a problem ? 
  i 'm sorry , but statecraft is a little bit harder than that . 
  especially when you 're talking about so many individual nations . 
  heck , government is night and day when you 're looking at southern vs northern europe not to mention the east . 
  the way we do government is n't the same , and it only appears similar from a very shallow perspective of it . 
  melding so many different ways of doing government into one bureaucracy simply wo n't do . 
   i 'm sorry but as an eastern europe we new what we were getting out of it , and it 's was n't the `` biggest powers on the planet '' , which after no 1 really are a far second to tenth . 
  we were getting america . 
  and they are the ones sitting at the syria table , not any european nations . 
  france and germany both have sizeable influence and military prowess -- their combined influence along with the rest of europe is nothing to gawk at . 
  not to mention the fact that european powers are staying out of syria is something i see as good . 
  if there were to be an alliance , the last thing i want it to be doing is pulling an usa and being completely interventionist . 
  with a growing russia , i would hope it would mainly be to protect our friends to the east . 
  hopefully france can regain her strength come this 2017 election . 
  sadly faudot * ( candidat pour le mrc ) * and le mrc * ( mouvement r\u00e9publicain et citoyen ) * does n't seem to be an option . 
  let 's hope le ps * ( parti socialiste ) * pulls something out of the bag ... oh hegemony stability theory , why must you haunt me so . 
  *** edited *** * to help out some people who might not get some bits of it . 
  i simply do n't think what you said is true . 
  respectfully , i think it is that sort of thinking which is really polarising this issue . 
  europe can , and has been , acting as a bloc . 
  i know not a soul in europe who is against a strong and united europe when it comes to alliances -- the problems only come with the bureaucracy and policy that comes from it . 
  nato exerts pressure because it is a coalition of not only america ( which is a huge player in it ) but the biggest powers on the planet . 
  a european sort of nato would be a force to be reckoned with ( if we put some more money into it that is ) . 
  i never said a loose military alliance . 
  perhaps a sort of `` european otan/nato '' . 
  most certainly not . 
  europe is one of the most culturally diverse areas on earth , and attempting to meld that into a unified state is not only going to be nearly impossible , but not something i 'd like to see . 
  what we need less of now , is huge international conglomerates , which have singlehandedly trudged up the millions of problems our world faces today . 
  i 'm also sick of the dichotomy of either completely destroying it , or making it a true confederation . 
  a european alliance is good in my opinion . 
  it could act as de gaulle had truly intended a european alliance to act like : as a `` 3rd '' way in a world seemingly always split between two rivals . 
  because you 're painting with quite a large brush and in doing so being the person you 're making fun of . 
  having both lived in the usa and in france , i can say , free of bias , that you 're being a complete idiot . 
  i ca n't respond to all of that right now , but a lot of socialists left hollande 's government for being too pro business ( like hamon ), 
  ** jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon : la france insoumise ** he 's the farthest left you 'll get in this election * ( even supported by many french communists ) * . 
  he has a more populist ideal * ( which is to say in the normal sense of the word , not the right-wing corruption ) * towards workers rights and business and most importantly citizen referendums . 
  he is for a complete reliance on renewable and clean energy by mid century , along with ditching nuclear for better alternatives . 
  he 's also interested in renegotiating eu treaties or the possibility of leaving if it all fails along with nato . 
  ** beno\u00eet hamon : le parti socialiste ** he 's quite far left for coming out on top of the socialist primary . 
  he has a fairly utopian world view as some would put it , with ideas for a `` basic income '' for all , legalising weed , and the taxation of robots . 
  he was seen as a shock to bap 's primary . 
  ** emmanuel macron : en marche ( ind\u00e9pendant ) ** he 's the centrist n\u00e9olib\u00e9ral candidat , with policies which are neither * `` left nor right '' * . 
  he 's socially fairly liberal ; however on issues such as business rights and economics he can trend towards the right . 
  he is also the most pro-eu candidate . 
  he has yet to be clear as to what his actual policy decisions are , gliding more so on image if anything . 
  ** fran\u00e7ois fillon : les r\u00e9publicains ** he 's the hard right if there is one . 
  a thatcherite of sorts , seeking for a drastic shrinking of the public sector , along with less restrictions on business . 
  some of his more outlandish claims are to increase the workweek while lowering the minimum wage to allow more options for businesses . 
  he is socially very conservative as well . 
  ** marine le pen : le front national ** the head of a newly modernised fn party , she 's the more nationalistic * `` right '' * ; however is in favour of the welfare state , and a certain level of other economically left ideals . 
  nevertheless she 's tough on immigration and has claimed to be close to donald trump on many of his key issues . 
  she 's sort of a grab bag really , considering donald trump 's many conservative policies and inexperience , paired with her more left policies in some regards and being a staple in modern french politics . 
  she is still socially conservative as well . 
  ** who will win ? 
  ** it 's really hard to say . 
  considering if l'affaire fillon proves to be true * ( his 1 million euro embezzlement scandal ) * he will drop out . 
  this may or may not leave lr with any horse in the race depending on if it happens before or after the march deadline .
