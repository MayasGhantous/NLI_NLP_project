  he affirmed article 5 , after a round of refusing to affirm it and questioning it 's use and legitimacy , or did you forget ? 
  http://www.france24.com/en/20170518-white-house-official-trump-threatens-leave-nato-usa-g7-russia also , trump 's actions in europe have been covered , almost meticulously . 
  i 'm sensing a disconnect between anglo media and what i read . 
   i can help . 
  his position is to put america and its citizens first in everything , always , like any sovereign nation should strive to do . 
  hmm , and yet his policies have endangered american influence and trade deals , and prefers that the u.s takes a hit in a trade war with the eu and china `` as long as the [ opposite party ] lose more '' . 
  a look beyond the populist rhetoric to the hard numbers shows that often times his claims are often erroneous , such as his misunderstanding on the fundamentals of the eu . 
  i ca n't speak for mexico , but they seem to have gotten closer to china to counter the threat , and trudeau stressed the importance of trade deals after a round of the u.s threatening them over milk , wood or whatever was the perfect scapegoat . 
  we 're going in circles , but your vision of a us that focuses on itself , and seeks more peace , does n't really align with what i 've observed with trump 's behavior , or his bellicose language . 
   no one was pushing for impeachment or calling him a danger to democracy , even though they felt his actions to be tyrannical . 
  i do n't remember any grace towards obama from the rights side , but i think he and trump are not equivalent . 
  not even bush had the same amount of gaffes in such a short period between trump and affiliates . 
  weird explanation . 
  i would have just said that their recent political/diplomatic scandals just delegitimizes the current governments . 
  yeah , but the only thing i 'm getting here is that it feels somewhat ridiculous , because aside from some nutcases who somehow feels the rabid homophobia of muslims is alright , who 's going to be affected by the sarcasm ? 
  beating down strawmen is by definition pointless . 
  it 's the logical equivalent of saying that all right wingers are fascists , when someone like anders breivik comes along , which is an argument criticized in the top comments , rightfully . 
   bankrolled huh ? 
  sounds bad . 
  how much money did he receive from murdoch btw ? 
  the same way that you said the mainstream media supported clinton . 
  it 's in the context that murdoch and his fellows have been supporting trump for a while now . 
  you do n't think there 's now not only an ideological split , but also information split on what information media is now published , especially on trump ? 
   why not ? 
  the media tells you he 's racist , and you believe them because many people passively watch the media and do n't really question them . 
  then your friends are saying that he is racist , because they heard it on the media , and that just serves as confirmation to you that he must be , since that 's what everyone around you believes ... notice that the media does n't really talk about how racist he is anymore ? 
  they are getting more mileage out of the russian narrative now . 
  eventually , they 'll go back to saying he 's like hitler again . 
  continuing on my point , have you noticed that you 're doing the same thing now , except with russia ? 
  you insisted it was `` nothing '' and yet as the debacle has progressed from when this chain has started , trump has gone to accepting that he knew about what junior did , to outright saying collusion is `` no big deal '' . 
  at this state , are n't you saying it 's nothing because you 're told it is ? 
  because with all the intelligence leaks , advisors connected to russia , attempts to lift sanctions , and financial dealings , if trump is n't affiliated with russia , he or his administration is otherwise compromised , or is just plain incompetent to let it progress to this point . 
   nepotism i agree with . 
  i do n't think his family should be involved at all other than melania as first lady . 
  i have no idea what qualifies jared or ivanka to do anything other than give him advice . 
  okay . 
  some trump supporters kept on saying how they were the best men for the job , or that they did n't see what was wrong with nepotism , but i have to admit you are saying something different . 
  people do say different things . 
  edit : due to the `` missionary effect '' most of the trump supporters you may see in r/europe say the exact same thing , so it gives the impression that they 're running off a script . 
  truthfully or not . 
  anyway , i retract the personality cult accusation than . 
   nobody talks about how much trouble he is having getting anything done , for example , due to the courts and republican failures . 
  too busy on russian bullshit for that . 
  well as an environmentalist , i wish more attention was placed on his adminstration 's dealings with the environment , including the defanging of the epa and deletion of geological data ( which are used worldwide due to the usa 's large amount of stations ) , but unfortunately the constant scandals plaguing trump means that there 's no time to discuss one issue , before attention jumps to another . 
  sidenote : well , until macron goes to the u.s / russia to beg both parties for money ( which le pen did i 'm not even kidding on how undignified that is for for a presidential candidate ) , i think this is just macron doing diplomacy with trump . 
  unlike with merkel , at least it did n't end in anger . 
  they 're not exactly on the same page , viewing some policy differences as well as `` interesting '' interpersonal interactions , but hopefully this means that the current free fall in relations between the us and france and in another measure europe wo n't continue . 
  i would n't be so worried about the re-rapprochement between the us and russia , if the u.s had n't threatened to quit nato , and since trump flip flops alot unfortunately , any further reassurances do n't build trust . 
  erratic behavior is worrying and it sort of raises question about who 's side the us would be on if russia attacked , say the baltics . 
  so , hopefully the latest meeting will change trump 's behavior , or he might just do a 180 once he return to his office . 
  quite frankly , both are possible . 
  i quite simply do n't know what his foreign policy is , since i 'm not sure if he 's sometimes purely safeguarding american interests . 
  could you avoid structuring your sentences like one of trump 's `` tweets '' ? 
  you know ... even as a `` progressive/liberal/leftist / whatever word is used now '' that everyone in this thread seem to be blaming as if i condone of this , i think that this is horrible and that those responsible should be prosecuted/deported . 
  i do n't think beating up a strawmen is helpful . 
  good luck to the polish . 
  hopefully they will be able to overturn what 's happening . 
  huh , italy has a giant gear . 
  anyway , i 'll say that luxembourg 's `` wings '' is the best symbol . 
  i would n't disagree with that . 
  while i believe that the living standards of the east have vastly increased compared to a few decades , more progress can and will have to be made . 
  i 'm more interested in what they were compared to . 
  what 's a chocolate orange ? 
  edit : into more serious matters , i do n't think the uk is equipped at all to deal with the negotiations . 
  huh , did n't know that . 
  well good for the greek , although i 'm not sure if they are well situated enough geographically or have the infrastructure for such a port . 
  the adaptation of the germans as a popular bashing target for the american far-right has made me more sympathetic to the germans , not less . 
  maybe because it reminds me of the iraq war , when that happened to us . 
  they 're paying ? 
  i would have assumed sweden would have subsidised them for the public . 
  well that 's dissapointing . 
  is there any entertainment that is not expensive in stockholm than ? 
  also , thank you for answering my question . 
  are the museums there good at least ? 
  i once visited london , but that was only for tourism and even than i mainly stuck to the museums . 
  i ca n't really disagree with samsung , it 's an extremely expensive city . 
  i 'm following the wisdom of the iberians . 
  take a nap when it 's too hot out . 
  les aristrocrates on les pendra !, 
  ( i recommend the song here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-srljmrjovi ), 
  is n't that ironic coming from the fact that a coalition of media owned by murdoch bankrolled trump and the brexit among other things ? 
  also , you lot are the ones who elected a oligarch who is now all for cutting regulations for businesses as well as lowering taxes for the ultra-rich . 
  corporate slave seems a hypocritical thing to call me than . 
  also , if you 've missed the point of social circles , i mean society in general seems to dislike the man for a good variety of reasons , not just because some newspapers `` said so '' , like you want to believe . 
  even if trump manages to eliminate the fourth estate , people will still oppose him . 
  ____________________________ are you missing the current scandals with his son ? 
  it 's still incredible , that you have such a clear cut case of collusion , which is rare in history that it 's so well documented . 
  at this point the only thing that would be so stronger would be trump outright saying `` i hate the u.s , long live tsar putin '' . 
  well , that and there 's also problems with political dynasties and nepotism with trump , refusal to distance himself from his businesses , constant political flip-flopping apart with russia and just general incompetence as an administrator . 
  would you prefer we focused on that instead ? 
  because the whole line that would tolerate legit criticisms of trump rings hollow when any criticisms that come from outside your group is deemed as `` propaganda '' . 
  what problems do you have with him than ? 
  if you 're going to do an interview flaw like `` he 's too honest '' spare me the bullshit . 
  _______________________________ well , why do you keep on responding ? 
  stubbornness , fun , rage or just frustration ? 
  in my case , it 's just because it gives something to do , that and a curiosity to see who leaves first . 
  frankly , you 've been here longer than most of the brexit guys , and at least you 've have n't just yelled `` maga '' and left ( yet ) . 
  * sigh * i should have guessed . 
  which side is which ? 
  most media really , apart from the conspiracy sites i suppose .
