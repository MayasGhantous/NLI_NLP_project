i agree with this polish politician . 
  poland should make military agreements with the top european powers , aka the french , the english or the germans , instead of the us . 
  is the `` low self-esteem '' a kind of thing in poland ? 
  imo poland is still a great country , and has ever been .

   to be honest a lot of you can be fucking assholes who cluster with each other and refuse to stop speaking french even though you 're on an exchange semester to learn the goddamn language and know the goddamn culture ... hein , de quoi tu parles mec ? 
  last ? 
  i though it was italy but i just checked , we 're fucking last . 
  what a shame . 
  show him your carte vitale . 
  a lot of buses left perpignan to go to barcelona apparently . 
  any french catalan here that went there ? 
  i 'm not one of them , but my father is a french catalan . 
  his first language is catalan , and he said that if catalunya was independent , he would like to go there . 
  we got it , you do n't like france nor the french . 
  now , stop drinking and do something more positive with your sunday .

  pretty much every movies i wanted to talk about have been mentioned . 
  except this very good flemish one : bullhead ( rundskop ), 
  i loved the pusher trilogy . 
  [ the intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51nzbmett1y ) is one of my favourite . 
  sure , i was just pointing out that the main reasons for the primaries to happen were not related to l'affaire dsk . 
  the process was decided in 2009 . 
  i agree with you on the legitimacy , but he was not in a position to claim the leadership without the primaries . 
  socialist primaries did n't happen because dsk was out of the game . 
  it was decided way before his famous ejaculation . 
  ps had no leadership and no one , even dsk , had the legitimacy to run for the presidency . 
  in regional elections , we vote for the regional council , so we elect members of the council . 
  then the members elect the president . 
  ~ ~ fn could arrive first in term of members elected but could lose the presidency against a coalition . ~ ~ edit : well , i need to check this out , maybe the party arrived first may be granted 50 % + of the seats . 
  i will edit if that 's the case . 
  edit : that 's the case . 
  that was the `` bonus to the first party '' he mentionned . 
  once you 're first , you have 1/4 of the seats , and then it 's proportionnal . 
  if fn is first and have at least 34 % of the votes in case of a `` triangulaire '' ( 3 parties in the 2nd round ) , they have 50 % + of the seats . 
  the french electoral system is not made for an isolated party , and fn is isolated . 
  many little parties like the greens can have the support of the ps in the second round , same with the centrists with les r\u00e9publicains ( the new name of ump , sarkozy 's party ) . 
  that 's why they will always get more seats than le pen 's party . 
  fn could have 30 % of the votes but they would n't have many seats . 
  that 's for the national assembly . 
  there 's just no way the fn could win the presidency , that 's not going to happen . 
  in 2002 , chirac had 82 % of the votes . 
  the support of fn is already huge , and we expect them to have big results in the coming presidency , to a point that i would n't be shocked if it was overestimated . 
  and we do n't ? 
  awesome .

  it 's interesting ( but logical ) that the three last have a strong russian influence .

  yeah that was a study focused on immigration . 
  the fertility rate is now a little bit higher , at 2 . 
  i 've read [ here ] ( http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/vraies-raisons-derriere-bonne-fecondite-francaise-francois-heran-683367.html/page/0/2 ) that the fertility rate of the french women ( of french nationality ) was 1.8 , but this article is a bit crappy and i do n't know if official numbers exist . 
  well , it has a little impact , of course . 
  [ see this , for example ( fertility of women born abroad ) . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6tt7vhn.png ) that does n't contradict with the fact that family policies has a great impact , too . 
  that 's a whole . 
  hey . 
  i lived in tours , france a few years ago and there was this roma family from eastern europe that lived just under my flat , in the courtyard . 
  i 'm not sure how many they were but at least two old and fat parents , a ~ 30 yo daughter and maybe a baby . 
  and sometimes others slept there but i 'm really not sure . 
  the day they were all dispatched in the city to beg money near caf\u00e9s or boulangeries . 
  they stayed there all day waiting for money . 
  i sometimes gave money to the young woman near my bar-tabac . 
  at 08:00 pm a local ngo gave them food and water if they wanted it near the trainstation . 
  after that they just went to the courtyard to sleep . 
  here 's the thing : i rarely heard them , they never did any kind of noises . 
  they never bothered me or anyone living around the courtyard , and the police never came there . 
  they just wanted to have some ( crappy ) place to sleep in . 
  sometimes they did some kind of party but never after 10:00 pm . 
  the other times i heard them were when they were arguing with each others and crying , probably about their crappy condition . 
  that was sad , really . 
  of course i have bad stories about romas , but i just feel sorry about the shitty life eastern romas have in france . 
  [ an hostage crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ouv%c3%a9a_cave_hostage_taking ), 
  we asked them too . 
  we would not keep our oversea territories if they did n't want to be a part of france . 
  last example : mayotte . 
  we would give nouvelle cal\u00e9donie independence if they want it in the future , because we feel really bad for what happened .

   the maghreb immigration fecundity is now very close to the french rate . 
  well , i do n't understand this conclusion . 
  on the link i posted below ( insee ) , it says that mothers born in algeria have a fecundity rate of 3.5 , morroco and tunisia 3.3 . 
  what am i missing here ? 
  it 's not . 
  the map may be wrong for normandy . 
  2 majority r1b types are , according to [ this site ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/europe/haplogroup_r1b_y-dna.shtml ) , l21 ( atlantic-celtic ) and u152 ( italo-celtic ) , not u106 ( germanic ) . 
  as there is little studies about france , it would be way much clearer if this one happened . 
  there is also the haplogroup l1 ( nordic ) : http://www.eupedia.com/europe/haplogroup_i1_y-dna.shtml, 
   text from alexis de tocqueville i got 19/20 h\u00e9h\u00e9 . 
  to add at what 's been said , i think that him being from sa could have played a role . 
  [ yep ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqvtoabnqk ), 
  who cares ? 
  we have derrick .
