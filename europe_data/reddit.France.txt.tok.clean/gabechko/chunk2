  come on , you 're an embarrassment . 
  it was the case at the end of and after the war when de gaulle wanted a national cohesion ( and the country needed it , really ) . 
  not anymore . 
  oh , i do n't disagree on that ( unlike some of my fellow countrymen here ) . 
  waterloo is worth commemorating . 
   but the french government got to understand why the french government ? 
  he 's above all very popular among the french people , as he 's one of the greatest leader we got . 
  and people likes greatness . 
  so people can show where they 're from / where their heart is . 
  there is a lot of mobility across the country . 
  the victory over the english ? 
   france [ ... ] use some out-of-the-frame numbering for regions ? 
  for d\u00e9partements , 1-95 , 2a/2b for corsica , 971-976 for overseas , plus the logo of the region that corresponds to the d\u00e9partement . 
  but you can choose whatever d\u00e9partement you want , you do n't need to choose the one that corresponds with your residency . 
  i did n't say i liked it . 
  that 's how the law is . 
  if a stubborn director decides that this is ostensibly religious , he can use that law one way or another to deny the entry , and this decision can be attacked in court . 
  but this is a very rare case , and the director who denied the girl the entry was kind of an extreme secularist . 
  i will try to translate what is forbidden in french schools , to give you an example on how this kind of question was recently handled . 
   le port de signes ou tenues qui manifestent ostensiblement une appartenance religieuse ( ex : voile , kippa , grande croix ) ou ceux dont le port manifeste ostensiblement une appartenance religieuse en raison du comportement de l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve the wearing of signs or dress that ostensibly manifest a religious affiliation ( veil , kippa , large cross ) , or those whose wearing ostensibly manifest a religious affiliation ** because of the student behaviour ** . 
  so it 's not the skirt itself , it 's also the behaviour of the girl that wears the skirt that can make it ostentibly religious . 
  it 's the exact same meaning in french . 
  apparently nothing happened at all !, 
  lol , well i guess i 'm a living stereotype then . 
  we 're a little bit touchy when it comes to wine . 
  that 's one of the only things we can be proud of in these times . 
  i know all about these events . 
  this has been posted a thousand times on reddit by americans who convinced themselves that they have better wines than the french . 
  it worked well on yourself . 
  you won that , that 's a well-deserved award for the hard-working californians who made it , but the fact is that french wines actually have won nearly everything , countless times . 
  that does n't make californian wines better than the french ones . 
  that 's like saying the greeks have a better football team than the germans because they won a european cup one time by mistake . 
  i loved abre los ojos , with penelope cruz and javier martin . 
  it 's not recent though .

  well , let 's make war . 
  and peugeot 3:32 . 
  that must be the mighty french enclave of romania . 
  the russian have the most glorious music in the world .

  your original analogy was so fucking stupid that this has n't go so far beyond as what you 're saying is still so fucking stupid .

  according to the italian wikipedia :  the a6 exceeds the colle di cadibona ( 435 m ) , the watershed between the ligurian apennines and the po valley , just 14 km , with a continuous path of tunnels and viaducts and , unique in italy , with a helical curve in the roadway south, 
  can you draw it ? 
  youngs between 12 and 16 yo : 40 % . 
  that 's impressive , congratz greece !, 
  we ca n't really say who will become the next president . 
  we do n't know the candidate of the right yet . 
  it 's between sarkozy and jupp\u00e9 ( the mayor of bordeaux , more centrist ) for now , both at ~ 30 % in the polls . 
  but anything can happen , the primaries are in november 2016 . 
  remember that during the socialist primaries , strauss-kahn was the guy supposed to be the next president , and with all the shit sarkozy is involved in ... 
  but definitely not hollande . 
  i think he wants to know the name of the traditionnal song , am i right ? 
  you should try / r/russia too then . 
  a very interesting text on that matter is the lecture ernest renan made at the sorbonne in 1882 , [ what is a nation ? 
  ] ( http://ucparis.fr/files/9313/6549/9943/what_is_a_nation.pdf ) , if anyone is interested . 
  his definition of a nation begins on page 10 . 
   we 're admittedly kind of unwelcoming ( rude ? ), 
  compared to others i do n't understand this clich\u00e9 . 
  what does it mean ? 
  * `` grossier '' / `` impoli '' * ? 
  if * grossier * , alright , but i think we 're very polite and i 've never seen anyone being unwelcoming to people / tourists . 
  and by unwelcoming , i do n't mean unhelpful , because that 's two different things . 
  also , real clich\u00e9 : we bad english, 
  regional languages are the legacy of our territories . 
  that 's part of what makes our country so different from north to south , from east to west . 
  if they 're endangered they should be protected . 
  you have n't met anyone who could speak a regional language . 
  well , that 's your experience . 
  my father speaks catalan as his native language ( with french ) , so that 's a little bit closer than your grandparents . 
  wow , libya ... 
  bombing this country was a great idea . 
  why not ? 
  more people can speak it in french catalonia than there is people in andorra . 
  yep , in term of tv coverage , rugby is the most popular sport after football . 
  6 nations , european cups and last part of the top 14 are all showed in public channels . 
  that means that we can see more rugby on tv than football . 
  ( if not subscribed to canal + or bein ), 
  alright . 
  invoking the inquisition and the crusades is often a way to defend nowadays islam . 
  that 's why i misunderstood his point . 
  fair enough , but what 's your point ? 
  the muslim conquests did n't have any impact on the world 's history ? 
   ever heard of the crusades and the inquisition ? 
  lol , and what happened before that ? 
  that 's really a stupid comment . 
  as if the muslim invasions / conquests did n't happen . 
   in france muslims are more oppressed than other religions . 
  they are not oppressed . 
  france defends religious minorities . 
  there is some discrimination . 
  gingers are also discriminated . 
  and chartres ( the first one - 1979 ) .
