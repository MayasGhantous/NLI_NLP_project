  and bourges . 
  you should give these elections a bigger interest , not because they 're important , but because it would save you from saying wrong statements . 
  conseils d\u00e9partementaux ( ex-g\u00e9n\u00e9raux ) do n't take care of primary schools , communes do . 
  same with most of pools ( `` piscine municipale '' ) . 
  they take care of coll\u00e8ges ( secondary school ) , and , more importantly , of solidarity and social welfare . 
  half of a cd budget is dedicated to it . 
  i know the point of your comment was to say that these elections have little impact , but i found that saying `` more than half of the population doesnt know what 's at stake '' was a bit ironic . 
  well , if you want to learn a language based on the weather , know that the south of france is very sunny !, 
  but instead of the sangria you 'll have to drink pastis . 
  you 'll get used to it . 
  also , you could go to one of our little french islands , in the caribbean or in polynesia for instance !, 
  nope . 
  and three years ago it was spain . 
  they just won a grand slam and kicked our asses in the 6 nations though . 
  1 / no politician resigned directly because of the attacks . 
  however , the minister of justice resigned in january because she did n't agree with the current politics . 
  2 / yes , there were reports or inquiries based on facts , and on the principle that the government and the security services can always do better and can learn of their mistakes . 
  this did n't turn into a witch hunt of `` those responsibles '' for the failures . 
  3 / depends on what you mean by national debate . 
  last time a national debate was proclaimed , it was about national identity and it was a huge mess . 
  however , national debates are more likely a constant thing that do not need to be proclaimed to happen . 
  so in that sense , yes , there is a natural national debate on security , integration and foreign policy . 
  the politicians often debate on tv and the topics change with the news . 
  what 's the eu flag doing in indonesia ? 
  cimer le uk . 
  i watched the first episode of baron noir recently , it 's a french political tv show . 
  looking great so far , and it has a fine cast . 
  i do n't know if there are english subtitles available though . 
   is there anything scifi or fantasy ? 
  [ les revenants ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bv_5ibpvuo ) is also a great tv show . 
  great soundtrack by mogwai . 
  yes , it 's really cool to watch the last kingdom after vikings . 
   ( 1302 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_golden_spurs#aftermath oh , so much nobles killed . 
  you made a lot of sons happy after this battle . 
  the problem with the french is that they do n't have a word for silhouette . 
   unless you want one where there is a separate silhouette for each ship ? 
  yep !, 
  this one already was posted by op . 
  it would be great to see an infographic similar to the british one you posted ( and to the us , chinese and german ones that were posted below ) , where all the ships are displayed , but for the french navy . 
  i think that 's what he meant . 
  i think he asked for one of these for the french navy . 
  i did n't find one in google . 
   and psg is killing everyone so yes we non-parisians normally do n't like paris or at least pretend not to to be fair not many people gives a fuck about football . 
  i do , but i find it extremely difficult to discuss football with people . 
  the fiber is being deployed actually . 
  yeah , culture does n't stop at the border and does spread to its neighbours , but in this case , it spreads from switzerland to france and italy , not the other way . 
  our fondue comes from savoie , which happens to be french since 1860 . 
  that 's a galette kebab . 
  [ it 's more like this . 
  ] ( http://images.cuisineaz.com/origin/2b5747be-847b-42d4-a9d0-cd919b159c9e_maxi-kebab-vip-mag-17[1].jpg ), 
  yes , those would be illegal , but this number of 31.2 per 100 inhabitants is n't an official number but [ an estimation ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/10/01/combien-d-armes-a-feu-circulent-en-france_1099601_3224.html ) , so they are included . 
  in addition to what has been said , there is also a lot of guns in urban areas . 
  families just inherit rifles from the older and more rural generations and keep them in their basement gathering dust . 
  [ it does . 
  ] ( http://www.marseillaise.org/english/francais.html ) even if we 're just talking about the first verse , which is usually sung , ` la patrie ' , the fatherland , refers to france , as a synonym . 
  the fact that it does n't say ` allons enfant de la france ' does n't mean that it 's not talking about france . 
  russian anthem also refers to the fatherland in the same way . 
  la marseillaise is all about france , the french and patriotism , and fighting the tyranny of france 's ennemies , aka everyone . 
  who ? 
  people from french catalonia ? 
  everything north of toulouse is parisian for them haha, 
  parisian accent is n't a ` posh ' accent , it 's probably the opposite , it 's kinda rough like [ \u00c9dith piaf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gevk04n0w ) . 
  well , that 's my idea of what is the parisian accent . 
  i do n't think that the standard french accent can be called ` parisian ' accent . 
  a posh accent would sound more like [ arnaud montebourg ] ( https://youtu.be/rm2yvykdbwm?t=1m25s ) . 
  at the end . 
  a lot of words end with [ ard ] ( http://dict.xmatiere.com/suffixes/mots_finissant_en_ard.php ) rather than [ ar ] ( http://dict.xmatiere.com/suffixes/mots_finissant_en_ar.php ) . 
  i guess it 's more intuitive to add a `` d '' . 
  til . 
  i 'm now proud to know that i have to write it with a `` f '' then . 
  i was so proud as a kid to know how to write n\u00e9nuphar properly , with `` ph '' and without a `` d '' . 
  and now , `` n\u00e9nufar '' looks like sms language . 
  however , it took me a long time to write `` cauchemar '' properly , i always added a `` d '' . 
  it is aired tonight , so unless you 've already watched the documentary , i would think that you 're the one relaying some kind of propaganda . 
  the six hundred years ' war . 
  it 's ok to show occitan but it 's not logical , if you want to show what the extent of occitan was , at least be fair and show the extent of every minority languages . 
  why no occitan and catalan in italy ? 
  why no alsatian in france ? 
  why no french or arpitan in vall\u00e9e d'aoste ? 
  why no gallo in the eastern part of brittany ? 
  why walloon over french but french over romansh ? 
  i have the opposite reaction : the poor management of the crisis is the reason that we need a more integrated europe . 
   why the heck are they protesting in france ? 
  european anarchists often protest abroad , that 's nothing new . 
  of course , he 's a drunken sailor . 
   you spelled rouen wrond you spelled wrond wronk . 
  [ big island france and little islands france ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ieyg7xs.png ), 
  oh , yeah , i know , but how does that make the senate more important than the na `` in protocol '' ? 
  like , the president has to say `` monsieur le pr\u00e9sident du s\u00e9nat '' before `` monsieur le pr\u00e9sident de l'assembl\u00e9e nationale '' or something ? 
  i will check this out on his november speech . 
  edit : well , he says `` monsieur le pr\u00e9sident du congr\u00e8s '' first , which is the president of the na , and then `` monsieur le pr\u00e9sident du s\u00e9nat '' . 
  edit : ok , i get it , it 's the term `` protocol '' that i did n't understand : [ legifrance ] ( http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=jorftext000000332354&amp;datetext ) pdt of the senate  pdt of the na , but d\u00e9put\u00e9s  s\u00e9nateurs . 
  what do you mean by `` in protocol '' ? 
   i despise when reddit personifies reddit as one large entity with only one large opinion on any topic ftfy, 
  reddit likes to fantasize about separatist movements . 
  yeah , every culture has its share of dark and morbid humour . 
  it 's the way the stories are told that matters . 
  you could tell the same dark story a hundred ways , and people from different cultures would react and laugh differently for each one . 
   you see when you launder money it is n't done by just one guy that 's what i said , ** hsbc ** 's clients . 
  nobody said here that he was a saint and a honest man .
