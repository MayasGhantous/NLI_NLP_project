  seems like children are blindly upvoting whatever they want to be true . 
  it closed down -3.1 % on friday and is at -0.2 % right now in afterhours trading . 
  funny how people just blindly upvote your lies . 
  the one bank that people claimed were cutting jobs ( morgan stanley ) was a lie . 
  google it . 
  the pound is only down 6.2 % in afterhours trading back to levels seen in february . 
  i dispute the premise that it 's a bad thing as well canada had their currency drop 25 % in 2014 and they 've thrived more than any other country in the g7 in 2015 just last january in one month they had 0.6 % growth . 
  eu has to abide by wto minimums if you do n't know this basic fact you should n't be speaking a word about trade . 
  no but i also bought into project fear until i work up on saturday and seen what actually happened . 
  he 's right it 's pretty much inevitable at this point . 
  french , german and spanish equities all down more than 10 % in afterhours trading while ftse has almost fully recovered . 
  euronext set to drop another 10 % on monday . 
  major pension funds have said they 'll be investing untold billions into a free uk and the few stories about job losses like morgan stanley and game of thrones were lies . 
  now that the uk called the project fear bluff successfully greece and others will as well . 
  sad week for federalists . 
  pretty good chance unfortunately especially if our exchange drops another 10 % as is forecasted on monday . 
  why did ftse almost fully recover from the 3 % drop in afterhours trading ? 
  why are countries all over the world begging for a trade deal with the uk ? 
  why are foreign pension funds committing hundreds of billions to uk investment ? 
  people on all sides will be asking this which is scary . 
  your government says you spent # 72bn on infrastructure in 2014 on top of the eu funds so i do n't understand . 
  also any idea why am i being buried for asking a question about the article ? 
  seems very immature in my eyes but maybe i 'm missing something . 
  you 're quoting the closing rate on friday afternoon which is embarrassing and using gbpusd after all currencies slid against the worlds reserve currency . 
  even still it 's down 6.2 % in afterhours trading , back to levels seen in february . 
  i reject the premise that a 10 % drop would be terrible . 
  canada had their currency drop 25 % in 2014 and in 2015 they led the g7 in net new jobs per capita , had their exports increase by 12 % and gdp rose 0.6 % just in the month of january . 
  i think you 're mistaken as the ftse has almost fully recovered in after hours trading while the spanish/french/german exchanges are still down more than 10 % . 
  euronext looks like it 's going to lose another 10 % on monday as well which is especially frightening for people here in continental europe .

  most euroskeptics here are left in my experience there 's only the odd fn . 
   ca n't make up your mind . 
  brits made up their minds on the 23rd . 
  17,000,000 decided to leave and that 's what they shall do . 
  david cameron already confirmed there would n't be another referendum : https://i.imgur.com/7q68pkn.jpg,

  major pension funds have said they 'll be investing untold billions into a free uk and the few stories about job losses like morgan stanley and game of thrones were lies . 
  showered with cash that the uk already gave to the eu right ? 
  my understanding from the article was that it was just money going from the left hand to the right hand to the left hand and that the uk was lucky to get 50 pence on the pound most years . 
  this was already shut down . 
  central government said le touquet accord would n't change . 
  i bet leave would win by an even larger margin after people watched ftse almost fully recover in afterhours trading while spanish , french and german exchanges are down more than 10 % . 
  this will have convinced the people who fell for project fear to not do so again . 
  the one major job loss story ( morgan stanley ) was debunked from the source . 
  some of the largest pension funds are now looking to invest hundreds of billions into the uk they 're in for years of great prosperity .

  greeks will break free soon . 
  they 've been subjected to project fear for years and now that the uk successfully called their bluff others will too . 
  the one major job loss story ( morgan stanley ) was debunked from the source , some of the largest pension funds are now looking to invest hundreds of billions into the uk brits took a chance and now are in for years of great prosperity .

  the referendum was final .

  i 'm looking at the euroskeptics currently leading half of eastern europe , fn leading polls here , netherlands freedom party calling for a referendum , denmark majority wants a referendum , afd/5 star on the rise and it sure does n't look to good for the eu right now . 
  why scaremonger ? 
  ask the eu why they went full project fear ( surprise all lies ) and why they 're continuing to do so in continental europe . 
  just wait until the turkey bribes stop working . 
  no more handouts for fyrom . 
  you clearly have n't even taken econ 101 . 
  canada 's currency dropped 25 % in 2014 and they had 0.6 % growth just in january , lead the g7 in net new jobs per capita last year , and had their exports grow by 12 % . 
  also people using usdgbp are ignoring the eur decline and that usd is the worlds safe haven when things look uncertain . 
  even considering that they 're four cents below 2013 levels in after hours trading . 
  project fear was just that . 
  one of the few . 
  probably more scaremongering/lies like the morgan stanley story that was debunked . 
  http://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/brexit-wont-trigger-canadian-corporate-exits-from-britain http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadas-largest-pension-funds-eye-post-brexit-bargains/article30609165/ the markets said it all on friday . 
  french , german and spanish exchanges tanked while the ftse only dropped some mere 3 % and has recovered almost completely in after hours trading . 
  did you not see the json link ? 
  look at the picture again . 
   the rules of the online petition clearly state you ca n't be serious . . regardless cameron himself already said there would n't be another referendum . 
  17,000,000 people voted leave and they won by 1,000,000 votes but regardless only some 30 % of those signatures are from the uk , many are repeats and many are from people in the uk that are n't allowed to vote . 
   our principal ally has just surrendered its biggest conduit for influence over world politics . 
  i do n't think brits on either side care , with respect . 
  outright amnesty is an option so is fast tracked citizenship or perhaps they 'll introduce long term work visas . 
  i work in canada four months of the year and we do n't have a union . 
  it costs me a few hours and $ 60 cad/yr . 
  canada had their currency drop 25 % last year yet . . - just in the month of january they had 0.6 % growth - exports increased by 12 % year to year - they 've led the g7 in net new jobs per capita odd how everyone hates that china/japan devalues their currency yet this is the end of the world . 
  ftse is up 2 % . 
  are you willing to fight for the eu in the streets ? 
  surely seventeen million wo n't rise against you but a few million will . 
  11/18 voting for remain for reference, 
  15.2 m -  14.1 m ( and ever widening ) is an overwhelming win by any standards . 
  bbc used the exact same phrase . 
  they said this moment would be sweet and they sure did n't lie , 
  there 's a good chance the entire eu will collapse due to the overwhelming win for leave . 
  i for one am glad . 
  thank-you britain for liberating us once again .
