  and remember how ** your ** government is fighting to ** not ** collect that tax ? 
  ireland is not ** only ** a tax haven contrary to say , luxembourg but the evidences are overwhelming that its economic performance is carried by its tax haven status . 
  i started providing stats from my very first post , you are the one not backing anything . 
  also , i never said the irish economy is just a tax haven but it is what reallly allows it to perform so much better than even germany . 
  linking to a wikipedia article is not going to explain how ireland gdp grew by 26,3 % in 2015 with industrial production growing by 65,7 % between 2013 and 2015 ... that 's because the only explanation for those ridiculous numbers is fiscal dumping . 
  the irish economic miracle is killing europe as surely as greek debt crisis . 
  those are public display items you are showing . 
  his record should also take into account housing , transportation , air quality , taxation , fiscal situation and so on ... 
  i have no idea if he was good or not regarding those items but they matters when you talk about a mayor legacy . 
  ireland is a tax heaven , not a model for the rest of europe . 
  unless you really believe that the irish are somehow * really * exporting more than * four * times as much in value per inhabitant than germany despite losing 22 % of its industrial workforce since 2000 . 
  there is a reason the irish government is fighting recovering the apple fine . 
  this was never an issue of jean luc melenchon ego , no matter how people keep repeating this as a fact . 
  the socialist party is torn between its left and its right ( macron ) and m\u00e9lenchon asked hamon to choose . 
  he did n't and thus m\u00e9lenchon decided to keep his campaign going because there is no point winning if your ideas get shot down by the so called reformist socialists . 
  fox news : european white barely survives encounter with malmo black gang . 
  coming next : how soon will stockholm burn ? 
  i know and it is one of the many reasons i have lost most of my appreciation for the eu these last years . 
  free trade first , ecology second is not responsible anymore . 
  actually , the crisis happened after the european reform that removed the last regulation tool , the quotas on milk production . 
  i am not saying europe is the only culprit in this crisis , it is n't but it is just another demonstration that unregulated free market in agricultural production is disastrous . 
  ditching the farmer support so that we can have even more intensive agriculture that devastates both the environment and the countryside way of life ? 
  i think not . 
  if anything , we need to close the doors to foreign agricultural products who are not environmentally sustainable . 
  you are aware that the american defense companies weight in their economy is smaller than the numeric economy ( google , apple , etc ) , retail economy ( wallmart alone is more than 300 billion $ income ) , agriculture , automobile and oil industry and so on ? 
  at the very most , it is less than the us military budget which is around 3 % of gdp and if you take into account that most of these 3 % is related to soldiers paychecks , you start to realize the defense industry is not the giant people imagine . 
  it does have disproportionate influence in congress relative to its economic size , true enough . 
  funny people think that considering the hyper inflation issue did n't last very long and the economic woes that brought hitler to power were deflation related . 
  yep , the perfect trade balance is neither a positive or negative one but a neutral one . 
  the other options both lead to long term issues . 
  that is not even remotely on the same scale issue wise . 
  are you aware that renewables energy deviced are not radioactives and that contractors do n't have to battle with radiation dose limits ? 
  they need a referendum to enforce a reform the parliament majority does n't want . 
  it is already cheaper if you integrate global warming related costs into coal . 
   cheap nuclear electricity oh boy , you are in for such a wake up call when you are going to realize they did n't stack enough money to dismantle the plants and that our national electricity company is on the edge of a financial breakdown . 
  so they defend their country with cool videos with epic music ? 
  because you ca n't say that defense is not a joke and then post some military porn that does n't include any relevant information concerning the military situation of finland . 
  especially the most important of all : with modern weaponry , is it more or less likely that finland might be able to create an effective defense against russian forces like they did in world war 2 ? 
  until now , i only ever had answers from armchairs generals of reddit on that subject . 
  in the cold war era and after the first gulf war , the main idea among military strategists was that modern conflict would be very intensive with high rate of attrition ( see the wiki article on airland battle ) which should in theory favor the biggest force . 
  but that does n't take into accounts more recent advancements in weaponry like the latest atgms , cruise missiles and missiles interception . 
  dude , my granmother used to live in marocco , my mother was born there before they had to go back to france because of the violence . 
  i know this . 
  but that the pied noirs got the short end of the stick does n't make what the french of that time did in the colonies any less bad and morally wrong . 
  you would be surprised by the amount of french people who think we brought civilization to algeria and that the ingrateful bastards kick us out and now ca n't keep their country running without our enlightened administration . 
  i would say a good 20 % of the population think that , which is not shocking when you consider how much le pen is polling . 
  it is the kind of stuff that makes it hard to like your fellow countrymen . 
  that it was * very * bad is obvious to everyone but the historically illiterate right wingers . 
  the problem here was that he was using the term crime against humanity which has a very specific meaning since the internation justice court has been established and that 's why even the french left has some cold feet about the idea of france being grouped with nazi germany . 
  oh come on , yeah slavery was already a thing in africa before but the europeans made the problem much much worse because it became a business with a growing demand that lead to africans to increase the slave supplies ... also , the africans profiting from slavery and those getting enslaved often were n't from the same ethnicity so you ca n't group them all behind the term africans ... 
  for the libyan affair , that is debatable . 
  yep , when you correct those numbers with the demographic , the picture is a lot less pretty . 
  looks like a misunderstanding : i am in support of the peaceful protests , not the riots . 
  how protesting against police violence and racism is questionable ? 
  again , i do n't see how i can be more clear : i did n't write `` the voters are wrong '' , i wrote `` i ** think ** the voters are wrong '' followed by `` i stand my ** opinions ** '' so yeah i do think i am considering that i can be wrong or i would be much more affirmative . 
  about what i am going to doabout it , vote and present my point of view to those who are interested in having this debate , that 's how democracy work . 
  i am not the authoritarian self righteous leftist you seem to think i am . 
  i said `` i respect the will of the people '' : i do n't see how i can be more clear . 
  tariffs are a part of mercantilism , not the whole of it . 
  its core idea , the idea of empowering the nation through trade surplus is the one behind the success of the european poster child economy , germany . 
   thank you for the civil response !, 
  you are more than welcome . 
  while i have sadly become a skeptic when it comes to the actual european union , i still share the european dream of the people of this continent interacting as if we were all european borthers and / r/europe is a great platform for that . 
  those are good points but the way i understand the union and the coming challenges ( and again , i am not pretending that i have the truth on the matter , i would be very happy to be proven wrong as i am farily pessimistic about our prospects ) , it is like being in an ocean in a tempest and given two choices : staying in a big boat that is sturdy but with show signs of leaks that are dismissed by the captain or try to brave the ocean in a lifeboat before the disaster strikes . 
  you do have a point than the lifeboat plan carries the risk of having all the lifeboats sinking whereas the boat could have been saved if the leavers had worked together . 
  in that sense , when you write :  in that sense , abandoning the eu would be the final nail in the coffin for progressive economic policies , because it would actually turn europe into a free-for-all wild west competition where governments would practically have their hand forced to lower taxes to keep up with what their neighbor is doing . 
  i think this is what we have already started and it is about to get worse . 
  i know but i would compare the current situation to a frog put in a pan where the heat slowly rise up . 
  i think the voters are not fully aware of the long term consequences and prefer not risking changing things too much despite their disatisfaction . 
  i also think that the left ideas have not been receiving a fair treatment in the political debate and are dismissed without being given enough time or consideration . 
  i am aware that it might sound very self righteouse , even downright arrogant to say this and sound like `` i am right , the voters are wrong '' but this is not my intent , i respect the will of the people but i stand my opinions . 
  depends on the definition of mercantilism . 
  by mercantilism , i mean that the consensus in europe is : `` you should be germany ! '', 
  and most countries have been practicing social and/or fiscal dumping to try to increase competitiveness and get a big fat positive trade balance . 
  but as most european trade is actually happening inside the eu and for each positive trade balance should correspond an equally negative one , that means this is a game where not only not everyone can win but the losers might bring down the winners with them through the single currency ... 
  our social welfare programs have been shielding us from the worst of it but they are starting to tear under the battering of high unemployment and stagnating income combined with aging populations . 
  social security is projected to hold if growth comes back . 
  if not , things might get ugly . 
  that would be okay if the current situation was the bottom of the pit . 
  but [ secular stagnation ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-4 ) theory has been gaining traction and if it proves right , i fear that as debt keep on rising , social welfare systems across europe start to crumble with devastating resulat . 
  i hope i will be wrong but when i see the social and ecological challenges of tommorow , i see a collision course . 
  but i also hear of alternatives , new ideas to be tested . 
  if i am right ( and i am not too sure i want to be , to be honest ) , there is a path that should be taken now and if europe is proving an obstacle to this , a hard decision would have to be made . 
  you are right to assume that i am a leftist and while i do recognize that the left alternative to the current economic system is not a experience proven facts hardened one , i would also say that our current system has not been performing that great , or at the very least that it had proved to exclude a fair share of the people and does seem to show very little will of changing or even self doubt . 
  criticism of an alternative is fair but should be weighted against the pros and cons of margaret thatcher `` there is no alternative '' current system . 
  i agree with you that a country outside of the eu would be weakened but then again , the damage done by fiscal and social dumping within the eu is sapping much of the eu strength too . 
  let us take an exemple of what i mean : the eu could pass legislation to tax financial transactions that would not harm very much mid to long term investments but would harm speculations . 
  we could try to make it so that investment in green and socially conscious countries would be encouraged by taxing investment in countries with little ecological regulations and poor worker rights . 
  those are hardly big communist moves and when those ideas were discussed , it was a very mild taxation rate . 
  but even those ideas were shot down . 
  capital should be free . 
  yes , except in practice it means free to devastate the environment outside of europe by outsourcing our goods industrial production and free to have our clothes made in workers exploitation paradises like bangladesh . 
  i am not saying i have answers but i would gladly take a 20 % salary cut to live in a country or better in a european federation where the homeless do n't die of cold in winter and where poverty rises as the same rate as the 0,1 % wealthiest income . 
  i used to think like you . 
  but the last years have been telling that the european union is too unwelcoming of any alternative economic and social models other than the holy trinity of productivism , consumerism and mercantilism . 
  i think all these models are running head on into a wall because of ecological and social limits . 
  i doubt it is possible to seek an alternative into a body with as many disparities between its member as the eu . 
  while remaining a nation comes with issue of being an entity of smaller size , it also provides the kind of flexibility in policy that would be unthinkable in a large european federation . 
  so you are tellling me that * alternative * ithaca is a fact ? 
  my god , it is spreading .
