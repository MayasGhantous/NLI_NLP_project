  le pen is in the elys\u00e9e by 2022 . 
  there is `` not doing too well '' and being a welfare queen telling what the taxpayers should think or why they are idiots for not spending more . 
  eastern europeans have shown during the migrant crisis that the relationship we have is not reciprocal . 
   better life conditions for everybody . 
  we spend money there so a few thousands engineers can produce extraordinary wealth for foreign shareholders . 
  that is great , such a good deal . 
  i am glad i can make those rich people richer . 
  largest political party in france mate  you are running out of time , enjoy that free money while you can, 
  maintenant !, 
  / u/ellindrosa has dryed .

  beleave in britain, 
   * self-hating brit * shame !, 
  shame !, 
  just like eurocrats then , 
  you know that the uk is still in europe right ? 
  speculators are speculating , soros is making a buck , not really a surprise . 
  do n't be mad , this is such a beautiful day,

  i western a lot before going to bed , but my girlfriend likes when i eastern her . 
  i guess you have to be an imperial federalist to think that is n't confusing . 
  agreed, 
   just do n't mention the 3 millions of people that moved to the west and now work and pay taxes there . 
  schengen is off-topic , you would be in it regardless ... 
   do you think we need those relatively small markets ? 
  that 's what unbelievable . 
  they somehow think that such a small market is a big deal , not for the uk , france or germany , but the * three * of them combined . 
  fuck my shit up please . 
   yes because , again , that was the deal for opening our market and leavin them say for what we spend that money . 
  the polish market is hugeeeeee , 1 billion poles to feed folks !, 
   i think the point is not to see it black and white . 
  there 's as much need to go full nativist ( all foreigners out ! ), 
  as to go blindly multi-cultural for no apparent reason . 
  multi-ethnic is n't the same as multi-cultural . 
   basically , if you argue that the referendum was on the same treaty you either argue that referenda are useless ( because the people are highly unpredictable in what they choose ) or that the irish are easily manipulated idiots . 
  wow never thought of it that way !!!, 
  haha . 
  nope . 
  the things we do for free-money, 
  looking at your comment history , you systematically resort to insults . 
  sad little thing !, 
  not on this sub at least , the ones who resort to the second kind of arguments often happily discard any fear regarding the integrity of both popular and national sovereignity as '' '' `` fearmongering '' '' '' . 
   the eu is n't a dictatorship lol . 
  hold my keks please . 
  junius claudius junkerius , those who are going to die salute you !, 
  i always take a cigarette after a good soros, 
  they layed the foundations for the rest to happen . 
  more jo cox until they get back in, 
   40 % white k?k, 
   butthurt americans this never grows old, 
  no worries !, 
   i am not saying it is a conspiracy , i have no evidence it is . 
  read . 
  can you ? 
   you will never have sex with '' '' `` former '' '' '' cia operatives  you will never leak war crimes committed by the us army  you will never leak us diplomatic cables  you will never bring proof that the us is massively spying on its citizens  you will never bring proof that the us toppled regimes all around the globe why live, 
  savage cuz it is true, 
  most people here who go on 4chan actually go to / int /, 
  this . 
  absolutely . 
  just take a look at the / r/enoughtrumpspam subreddit , i 'd make a quick estimate that around 60 % of the posts that are made are from two months old account that exclusively post about hillary clinton . 
  we know the kremlin was doing this , there are no reasons why our own corrupt politicians would not do that . 
  you can be pro-remain and acknowledge that the eu needs change and that the power that are lobbying in your own camp are not the parangon of the ethical and sane corporate entity . 
  just as much as you can acknowledge ( as a pro-brexit ) that the `` britain first '' folks and the neo-nazis are not good people and need to fuck-off . 
  and is that supposed to be a ridiculous thing ? 
  a beautiful and dynamic young pro-remain mp gets savagely murder by a vicious nazi who happens to support brexit a few days away from the vote at the very moment the brexit camp is gaining momentum . 
  vote that has extremely high stakes for massive corporate and financial entities . 
  i am not saying it is a conspiracy , i have no evidence it is . 
  but that does sets-off a few red flags . 
  and i ca n't believe it has n't crossed everyone 's mind . 
  i am glad that the proud ottomans can see through the perfidious anglo 's tricks !, 
   [ the eternal anglo ] ( https://data.desustorage.org/his/image/1459/08/1459089233479.jpg ), 
  the roman empire was the best thing to happen to us . 
   normandy is a separate entity from france despite being a vassal to the king of france  england invaded by french troops , by french of normans ancestry ( and french culture ) is depicted as normandy invading england this anglo propaganda meme needs to die . 
  * normans * did n't exist in a vaccuum , they were french . 
  you got invaded by the french . 
  you are french rapebabies . 
  you are speaking a french-germanic dialect . 
  deal with it froggy rosbifs . 
  democracy ? 
  let 's take a look at switzerland : very nationalistic and the most democratic european country . 
  let 's take another look at france or the netherlands : arguably none of them are n't nationalist countries and yet democracy was disavowed during the referenda of 2005 by the same union that claims to be its champion . 
  so weird !,
