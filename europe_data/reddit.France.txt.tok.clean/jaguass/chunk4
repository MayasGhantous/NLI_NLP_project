  you 're making a case for politicians to remain as a closed cast system . 
  also do n't underestimate the versatility of french political elite . 
   girls grow penises neither with this ... 
  belgium is divided in 2 parts : the part france makes fun of , and the part the netherlands make fun of . 
  i already know brel , i 'm looking for something more recent and more rock 'n' roll . 
  always great to remember him though !, 
  thanks also for sharing the flemish ones !, 
  of course . 
  they are wayyyyyyy better than us at poking fun at themselves . 
  also , surrealism . 
  belgians are funny as fuck . 
  edit : also , i love the rough melancholy their singers sometimes inspires . 
  i only remember [ arno ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivs_5r7jwks ) , but if you have more of the same style , i 'm interested . 
  the sky is falling . 
  do n't come . 
  absolutely terrible , as always, 
  please do n't invade anything . 
  disagree , eixample has a lot of soul . 
  ildefons cerda , bitches !, 
  [ it 's fucking picturesque , it 's what it is ] ( https://youtu.be/zgopgwixjpk?t=31 ), 
  the religion is still big in the south ? 
  are you from the north ? 
  and ireland, 
  also lost to east germany once if i 'm correct, 
  my long-run analysis ( for usa and latin-american countries ) : violence is embedded in colonization ; the size of most american countries made it impossible for new-born states to regulate conflicts , so , homicides happened . 
  that 's for the genesis of american countries . 
  then , the lack of social justice embedded in us-shaped liberalism ( exported through monroe doctrine ) paved the way for massive income inequality . 
  the [ gini index ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/2014_gini_index_world_map,_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg/2000px-2014_gini_index_world_map,_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg.png ) is correlated to the homicide rate . 
  it 's not hard at all . 
  just look at american history . 
  and the fact that the usa have been at war [ 93 % ] ( http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article41086.htm ) of the time since 1776 . 
  also you can be interested in this : the [ monopoly on violence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monopoly_on_violence ) by the state has been achieved very late in the context of colonization and conquest of the american west . 
  makes daily life much more violent than a state-controlled violence , even with a war and a genocide . 
  terrourism, 
  i use a qwerty, 
  this comment is everywhere in this thread . 
  from someone living in brazil , well ... that 's cute, 
  read that in dr dre 's voice , 10/10, 
  i prefer when spaghetti western are from bolognese region , thank you, 
  can confirm , am retarded, 
  i 'm seeing you now . 
  you do n't have to love catholics ? 
  no sandals on sock ? 
  there are dozens of us !, 
  fuck the grid system , this is europe bitches !, 
  hahaha yes !, 
  the people of paris has always been fiercy and prone to revolution . 
  that 's why louis xiv moved the royal palace to versailles . 
  the revolution of 1789 is known as the french revolution , but we also had major revolutionary episodes in 1830 , 1848 and 1871 ( some also mention may 1968 ) . 
  unfortunately the gentrification put an end to that . 
  what a french thing to say, 
  let 's stop fucking flies in the ass my friend  we disagree on this point : what you call constructive ( going there and meeting the unions ) is not constructive in my book if no solution comes out whatsoever . 
  which is the case : nothing came out , macron clearly told them he wo n't do anything to save their jobs . 
  so it 's bla , bla , bla . 
  macron 's politic is leaning towards entrepreneurs and not towards the workers . 
  the whirlpool visit was an act . 
  critical thinking is good , do n't buy everything the mainstream medias say . 
  it 's not macron vs lepen here , it 's cheap shots vs relevancy . 
  you said he had constructive actions that day . 
  i have no clue of said actions , then i do n't believe they exist , plain and simple . 
  and i would be glad to be proven wrong if you can back up what you say . 
   have a good day !, 
  yeah , that 's the narrative i saw in all the mainstream medias . 
   i 'd say his actions were more constructive than what you give him credit for do you have any concrete information to back it up ? 
  you did n't fool us on the [ building ] ( http://www.informationssansfrontieres.com/culture/img/villamedicis.jpg ) that host the french academy in italy either ps : it 's called the villa medicis , fam, 
  another piece of italian artistic heritage on french soil , then ? 
  yeah , it somehow was , but it was mostly a show for the cameras . 
  do n't be fooled , the real stuff happens elsewhere . 
  macron does n't give a single fuck about unions . 
  he went there to tell them there wo n't be a help from the state , were he be elected . 
  his objective of that was to send a message not to the workers , but to the people in france who are tired of strikes and unions . 
  it 's a campaign . 
  it 's made to take all the cheap shots they can . 
  he did visit the unions ; he made a relatively good score in amiens . 
  it 's up to you to link those two facts , but it would be better if you had a serious paper to back it up , otherwise it 's just your opinion . 
  keep in mind presidential candidates usually have slightly better scores in their hometown . 
  amiens has never been representative of its region . 
  for instance the fn have unusually low results there , for a presidential election : 2012 , presidential 1st round : 16,56 % 2017 , presidential 1st round : 18,42 %, 
  we talked about it way too much , even now . 
  like it was a decisive step of the campaign . 
  i 'm up, 
  why even bother taking about that , they both took a cheap shot for the cameras that day ... 
  yeah , the name is bernadette soubirous . 
  she saw the virgin in that lourdes cave a while ago , now it 's a pilgrimage town . 
  c'mon , there 's no rivalry between france and italy . 
  ... italy wished there were . 
  confirmed . 
  it 's never about the caravan , guys . 
  edit : jk . 
  love the dutchies !, 
  le private joke, 
  thanks !, 
  it totally make sense now . 
  what they call pullunder , we call pullover in france . 
  edit : actually that kinda make sense , if you consider the germans need to wear a coat more often than us ... 
  i like how it has a different name in every country ... babyfoot in france , futbolin in spain . 
  what else ? 
  edgy, 
  ew , monarchs are so 1750, 
  chicken and white rice , and i made a mustard sauce to go with .
