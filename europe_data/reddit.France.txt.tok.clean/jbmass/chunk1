they should elect someone else are you implying they have a choice in the first place ? 
  our former president even insulted someone once . 
   it was laden osama bin ? 
  well we have parra and machenaud . 
  of course you can , you 're danish , 
  pretty sure he 's talking about that : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinking_of_the_rainbow_warrior i ca n't see anything else . 
  surprised that you have nothing on the french , you sheep-fucking spear-tackling ( '11 rwc * wink wink * ) cunt . 
   hell , i even saw that pp brought sarkozy to their campaign closure ( lol ) . 
  how to lose any credibility hahaha, 
  french guiana : https://www.google.fr/maps/@3.5413416,-52.8544161,562609m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=fr, 
  went fine , except for algeria and indochina . 
  hah the last one reminds me of a bridge on the france-brazil border , where there was a bridge built over a river ( the river is the border ) , with a road connected to it on the french side , but absolutely nothing but forest on the brazilian side . 
  they are in the same country , i never said otherwise . 
  they do n't feel like they are spanish , though , why would they support a region from a country that they do n't feel is theirs ? 
   are you such an egoist that you do not want to help the country 's poorer regions ? 
  they do not feel spanish . 
  why would they support a spanish region ? 
  switzerland , slovenia , spain . 
  and obviously france . 
  welcome to reddit , where some people call any country a shit-hole because it 's not up to their standards . 
  they have good rugby players , too . 
  vice news , not vice . 
  do n't get confused . 
  you 're definitely colourblind . 
  why would guyana count ? 
  it 's independent . 
  french guiana should count though . 
  fireworks though . 
  i unfortunately would not be surprised if the sarkozy/libya theory turned out to be true . 
  do n't they overtake on the right in england ? 
  austrian , i said , not australian :p, 
  nothing more confusing for the eye than the austrian flag above the dutch flag . 
  of course you have an accent , everyone does . 
  thanks angela !, 
   a funny accent in france would be in northern france ( ch ` ti ) . 
  i ca n't stand that accent , to be honest . 
  what about the marseille accent ? 
  source : le figaro . 
  not the same situation , mayotte was n't an independent country . 
  they voted for more integration within france instead of more autonomy . 
   what do you think should be the ideal weather ? 
  never under 20 \u00b0 c , that 's for sure . 
  which is quite the contradiction for me , because i love skiing . 
  we do n't even reach 35 \u00b0 c here in nice , it 's brilliant . 
  still hot , but could be worse . 
  who is it ? 
  interesting video about kadyrov : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krxltnnenzs, 
  mine is tomorrow . 
  i could n't care less . 
  he must 've been in marseille . 
  drivers there are maniacs . 
   never seen a dog poo in the middle of the pavement mentalities are changing , but a few years ago in nice it was really bad in some parts of the city , for example . 
  the russian annexation of western sahara . 
  reading the part about bhl made me so happy . 
  in french it 's called a mac\u00e9doine ( yes , macedonia ) . 
  `` who throws a shoe , honestly ! '', 
  - george w. bush, 
  ca n't be as corrupt as levallois-perret . 
  jewtown , actually . 
  i do n't understand these people signing up instantly . 
  i 'd wait for the constitution to be finished , at least . 
  we do , but they 'll never come close to winning . 
  pyramid = egypt = muslim = is the proof is right here, 
  you could at least pretend that i am funny . 
  we never had to study bulgarian in france . 
  i know , i was n't sarcastic actually . 
  a truly flawless plan . 
   their psychology is obey orders and follow all rules . 
  strange people, 
  unfortunately , we have no choice . 
  in ajaccio at least , it 's two . 
  i 've literally never seen or heard about people doing 5 kisses . 
   did n't new caledonia want independence ? 
  eeeeh it 's complicated . 
  there will probably be a referendum in the coming years , but the yes is n't guaranteed to win . 
  and , you know , [ win the yes , need the no to win , against the no ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv3l2y7uwnq ) . 
  thank you , now i can laugh at wallonia and southern italy . 
  got ta protect those oppressed ukrainian speakers in transnistria . 
  what does this map show ? 
  it 's not really explicit . 
  let 's make the geneva people 's republic . 
  at least you know he wo n't lie to his people . 
  who decided that this would make sense in the first place ? 
  i see and hear my fair share of fn supporters here . 
  but i also live in paca , so ... 
  in here http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/hovercraft.htm it says '' \u041c\u043e\u0451 '' , what 's the difference ? 
  crimea, 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 !, 
  8k per year ? 
  shit that 's low . 
  not being sarkozy is pretty much the only reason he got elected . 
  most hilarious thing i 've read tonight . 
  fun fact : in france we have 36000 municipalities . 
  i 'm unable to answer that . 
  the crazy thing is , it was actually inhabited at some point : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clipperton_island#guano_mining_and_the_tragedy_of_1917, 
  only greece has green grass and trees and houses . 
  serb republic might be too easy to confuse with serbia for a majority of people . 
  you can put greenland flair on the sidebar . 
   til istanbul is in europe well yeah . 
  always has been .
