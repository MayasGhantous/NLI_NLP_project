  my point was merely that extremists are n't powerful enough to actually `` beat us '' in any meaningful way . 
  does n't mean that we should n't end them . 
  do they ? 
  at the end of the day , in france all terrorist attacks that happened this year have killed much less people than carbon monoxide intoxication has . 
  if we 're not getting defeated by carbon monoxide , we sure as hell ai n't facing defeat at their hands . 
  edit : to clarify this statement , i 'm merely pointing out that * actual * defeat at the hands of extremists is n't a possibility , if only because they lack firepower and manpower . 
  does n't mean we should n't do whatever it takes to destroy them . 
  terrorist attacks every couple of months in seemingly random locations across european countries - * if * they have the resources to pull this off - would severely disrupt daily life . 
  it 's one thing when a self-radicalised kid or a small terrorist cell working autonomously engages in terrorism , but it 's quite another when it 's decided from isis hq in the capital of their de facto state . 
  we 're moving from `` boston bombing '' territory , to small-scale pearl harbor territory . 
  that 's setting aside all the shit they do in syria and iraq , committing quasi genocide against yazidis , mass war crimes and countless other crimes . 
  history will judge us harshly for not having made credible attempts at intervention . 
  i was saddened by the crash when i first learned of it , knowing for sure that it was terrorism makes it far worse . 
  the only thing i can say is that i hope russia and france will now see eye-to-eye in fighting isis . 
  given hollande 's speech yesterday calling for a unified coalition against daesh , it certainly seems headed that way . 
  well you know what they say , * all 's fair in love and war * . 
  hollande specifically mentioned in his speech to parliament that it was article 42.7 that was being invoked . 
  by extended family , surely you mean one entire ethnic minority numbering in the 7-figure . 
  it 's very much uncertain that assad leaving power now stop the killing . 
  a cadre of alawite officials continuing regime business as usual would n't change much because they 're pretty much equally hated as assad himself . 
  rebel groups destroying the regime and whatever infrastructure remains but then squabbling for power would mean even more killing and more unstability , and very predictably genocide attempts against some of syria 's ethnic minorities . 
  i meant the us and the uk as governments that remain accountable to their past decisions , not the people in its entirety . 
  it 's not a matter of acting holier than thou . 
  it 's a matter of accountability . 
  meh , that 's like saying that because organized crime will always exist , then any effort against one mafia organization in particular is futile . 
  it 's not . 
  international terrorism , just like organized crime , ebbs and flows . 
  the de facto , ongoing existence of a `` caliphate '' is a massive p.r win for extremists which emboldens them , and letting them keep a relatively safe homebase from which they can plot international terrorist attacks is unthinkable . 
  we would n't be in this mess if the us/uk had n't invaded iraq . 
  isis would n't be a thing . 
  the british public would n't be war fatigued if the us/uk had n't invaded iraq . 
  how kind of the us and of the uk to needlessly wreck shit up , make fun of us when we stood against intervention in iraq , and then leave us pay the tab claiming you guys are war fatigued and going home . 
  buy french products . 
  visit paris . 
  simple as that . 
  they 're trying to disrupt our way of life , tranquility and tourism revenue . 
  do n't let them do that . 
  hollande is going to address both chambers of parliament on monday . 
  i can only suspect that if something big is decided , we 'll learn about it then . 
  i would n't know that . 
  syria and iraq still have relatively functioning states already which maybe could take over if we so much as significantly degrade isis without then occupying eastern syria/western iraq . 
  france has not been willing to work with assad so far and i have no idea whether the government now intends to soften its stance regarding the regime . 
  call me a wishful thinker , but desperate situations call for desperate measures . 
  only thing i do know for sure is that half assing our intervention against isis and being kind enough not to put boots on the ground has not deterred terrorists from engaging in full-blown reprisals . 
  thankfully people have started to wise up in recent years . 
  public opinions already stood against military intervention against the syrian regime a couple of years ago - rightly so , in my opinion . 
  everybody except hollande started acknowledging some time ago already that the regime could play a role in wiping out daesh . 
  to the extent for the last month or so , france kinda stood alone in its '' * neither isis nor the regime * '' policy . 
  now that the french government has pledged today to wage a ruthless fight against isis , i personally hope that only the first part of this '' * neither , nor * '' will remain relevant from now on . 
  i ca n't say i disagree with your conclusion . 
  also agree with the idea that libya , iraq and the syrian regime should have been left alone . 
  you 're right , we ca n't let them murder and rampage and there 'll inevitably be reprisals for any action taken against them ( though to be fair , opening fire indiscriminately on civilian crowds is as bad as they can currently manage , so they 're already at full swing reprisals against us ) . 
  we ca n't occupy syria either , this would be insane on top of being logistically and financially impossible . 
  public opinions would n't be up for this for very long , at least not from the moment onward where boatloads of soldiers start coming home in coffins . 
  however , syria still has a state infrastructure . 
  areas retaken from isis in syria could plausibly be run and taken back under regime control . 
  not sure of how exactly could that could go , but from our western perspective this is probably the best possible outcome in the region . 
  no idea how to proceed in western iraq though . 
  i 've seen the video you 're referring to , and many others of pows being mistreated . 
  i 'm not desensitized to the footage , but i am used to watching it . 
  thing is , they take place in warzones . 
  you already know instinctively that this is hell on earth and assume the worst will happen , and therefore you more or less consciously put some `` psychological distance '' between a syrian pow and yourself . 
  now watching this video shot in front of the theatrer was ** definitely not ** a vanilla or mild experience for me . 
  i know this place , i know these streets , i might as well been one of these young men going to a concert with my friends but ultimately dragging a possibly dead body across the street in complete panic . 
  this may not be gory to you , but i assure you this is a near unwatchable nightmare to me . 
  sheer horror . 
  america fucked up ** big time ** by invading secular iraq and unwittingly turning top baathist officials into leaders of what would eventually become fucking isis . 
  we would n't be having this conversation if they had n't , i ai n't arguing against that . 
  but now that it is a done deal and only as far as western civilians such as you and i are concerned , are we really so sure other armed interventions are as counter-productive as iraq ? 
  the us has n't had an attack anywhere near the scale of 9/11 , al qaeda ranks have been decimated , between 2005 to 2014 terrorist attacks in the west had become rare and now are on the rise thanks in part to the powerbase isis and aq in the arabic peninsula have built in destabilized regions ( respectively syria/iraq and yemen ) . 
  the rise of isis is a major setback , but their territorial foothold can be conquered and their state destroyed . 
  aqpa can hopefully be droned into oblivion as well , and this would be a lot easier to do if we prevented saudi arabia from helping extremists in yemen . 
   one of the most effective things the west could do is cutting off all relations with saudi arabia completely and stop pretending like we do n't know it 's them funding isis and groups similar to it . 
  agreed . 
  unfortunately , i also agree that this is n't going to happen . 
  thing is , they deny it for obvious political and diplomatic reasons but isis pretty much already is essentially a de facto state , * and * on top of that it is also an international network of affiliates . 
  if attacks carried out in the name of isis can be precisely tracked back to decisions made by * isis-as-a-state * ( as opposed to * isis as some loose , foreign affiliate merely cashing in on their `` brand '' name * ) working under a relatively traditional chain of command , it might be time to destroy their state . 
   even if it was plotted in syria , is is already crumbling under recent assaults in both iraq and syria , and is likely to lose all its territory within the next two years , perhaps even one year . 
  if we do n't help them lose territory , such an outcome is anything but guaranteed . 
  some of their territorial gains have been reversed recently , but they still have a still strong foothold in certain areas . 
  i 'll stand by my government 's decision no matter what , but if that 's what they decide i sure would n't be against boots on the grounds against motherfucking isis right now . 
  horrifying . 
  i am speechless . 
   there is even a nickname to finish it off he was mildly concerned his full name would a bit too short otherwise . 
  the nickname really ties it all up together . 
  no matter how high you set the bar for what constitutes heroism , witold pilecki undoubtedly remains a hero in the truest meaning of this word . 
  this is a man of few peers . 
  still a bit of a strange thing , if you 'd ask me . 
   you are not subject to a credit check when ordering a mobile plan for example ? 
  i did n't know credit check from third-parties while ordering specific items was even a thing anywhere , to be honest . 
  i assumed that those checks were a one-time thing done by the bank itself when you sign up or ask for a loan . 
  this idea is so strange to me that i 'd probably be pissed off to no end if i had to run a credit check , or worse help somebody else do it , for like a $ 40 expense . 
  thanks , finally makes a lot of sense to me now . 
  is this rating system handled by each bank separately ? 
  maybe , but i still do n't understand much when americans discuss short term credit . 
  i 'm not even quite sure if credit card debt is a thing here , nor what `` build up credit '' could possibly mean . 
  agreed . 
  i 'm all for gay rights , but come on this is absurd , activists of all kinds should pick their battles more carefully if they wan na be taken seriously . 
  men who have sex with men are statistically at a far , far greater risk than the general population . 
  donating blood was n't forbidden as part of some homophobic conspiracy , not out of prejudice or out of spite .
