what 's a divi ? 
  this is missing the most extraordinary exchange : armenian * erku * . 
  and ** yes ** , this is a regular derivation from indo-european ( though i have no idea what the intermediates are ) . 
  do n't forget that the goal of this business is not to make money by any available means , but to be a ( financially independent ) newspaper ( as in : the journalists writing it are very well-known in france for this ) . 
  as such , for their independence 's sake , it is probably much better to invest in something which is only barely following inflation but neutral with respect to investors , i.e. 
  sicav for example . 
  yes they could probably make more money ( in the short term ) by buying some bullshit offshore tax heaven derivative future product , but a person interested in this would not work in the * canard * in the first place . 
  thanks for taking the time to read my comments !, 
  i feared that , for a few minutes , someone would be wrong on the internet :-) if you need any more help translating from french , i will be happy to oblige !, 
  impressive but painfully wrong , alas . 
  the numbers for paper profits and financial profits should be * added * and not subtracted ( this reminds me of the missing-dollar fallacy ! ) . 
  / u/i _ really_like_cheese , probably your french is less impeccable than your accounting :-), 
  as i said earlier , this is not an investment business , but only a newspaper basically sitting on a pile of cash , and wisely putting it in the bank instead of storing gold bars !, 
  ** no , no , and no ** . 
  the total profit for the year is the last line on the left , which is `` r\u00e9sultat courant '' , or 3.7 m $ , which is the ** sum ** of the 1.7 m $ of paper profits ( `` r\u00e9sultat d'exploitation '' ) and the 2m $ of financial profit ( `` profits financiers '' ) . 
  subtracting them is irrelevant : if i make 20 $ out of selling apples and then 30 $ out of selling oranges , then i make 50 $ total , and not 10 $ out of oranges-except-apples , which is basically what you are implying here . 
  edit : ** proof of my claim ** : just add the numbers for `` r\u00e9sultat d'exploitation '' ( paper profits ) , `` r\u00e9sultat financier '' ( interest on the savings ) , and `` r\u00e9sultat des op\u00e9rations faites en commun '' ( the intersection of the previous ) , it fits right down to the last euro : ? 
  2058524 +1708200 +5496\u00a03772220 the * 2m $ profit * quoted by the title is perfectly correct , inasmuch as it is a rounding-up of the 1.7 m $ of newspaper profit . 
  and it has ( seriously ) the very bestest * mots crois\u00e9s * ( crosswords puzzle ) of all the french press . 
  they are not only difficult , but filled with pun ( at least one per clue , sometimes more ) and lots of cultural references . 
  well , it is a old and respected newspaper ( they did cause not a few ministers to resign , for instance ) , and during their century-long history they actually made quite a bit of cash , which they put in the bank , where it generates interest ( at a quite low rate , about 1.6 % if you do the math ) . 
  but they still ** make a profit out of selling the paper ** . 
  not at all . 
  the * canard * actually earns money . 
  well , this leaves that - they still make 1.7 million euros out of selling paper . 
  the `` produits financiers '' column is basically irrelevant . 
  all it says is that they have a big cash reserve , and instead of hiding it in some duck 's nest , they put it in the bank , presumably in the shape of low-yield , low-risk assets such as sicav . 
  the yield of their financial assets is about 1.6 % which is frankly not that impressive . 
  i was told that at djibouti , the exchange rate between us and french soldiers was 1 french ration for 3 american ones . 
  ( this was a few years ago . 
  also , `` i was told that '' . ), 
  surprisingly ( given our reputation ) , france is one of the very few countries where this show is censored . 
  yes , we are prudes . 
  allegory is the degree-zero form of cartoon . 
  it is also very frequent in cartoons from countries with a more recent tradition ( such as , well , many countries outside europe !, 
  why not a continuous color gradient ? 
   `` dressed like that , do n't be surprised if you get raped '' . 
  this is plain stupid . 
  why would a hetero male want to dissuade nice-looking women from dressing nicely ? 
  as a fellow hetero male , i complain about this !, 
  this might be because those us cartoons are actually allegories and not actual cartoons ; allegory probably being one of the earlier stages of cartoon development . 
  why do those gdp values start at $ 0 ? 
  ( and by the way , it should really use a log scale , and probably be inflation-adjusted too ) . 
  well , this is actually a map of turkish constantinople - as you can see in the `` seraglio del gran turche '' ( topkap\u0131 ) at the point of the peninsula . 
  plus , really , the costumed turks at the bottom are a dead giveaway . 
  well , better say * some * farmers . 
  there are also some who are conscious that french agriculture is massively export-oriented , and therefore no tariffs = = good for them . 
  add to this that , in 2005 , then prime minister jean-pierre raffarin promised , a few days before the referendum , to resign if he lost . 
  * cue an unexpected loss of the referendum ( unexpected = 5-10 % swing from the last opinion polls ) * . 
  do n't forget that the french left wing got burned once , voting for chirac in 2002 - and then receiving not even a single word of thanks . 
  we should not assume that the same would happen in the case of ( * shudder * ) a sarkozy-le pen duel , both because of the `` been there , done that '' effect , and because sarkozy is perceived as much , much less republican than chirac . 
  - what is this `` 16-20 '' category that stops at 17 ? 
  - oh , finally a map that helps seeing the difference between sw\u00e5dish and d\u00e5n\u00f8-n\u00f8rw\u00e5gian !, 
  - in english there are actually \u00e9 in loanwords from french , and ( old-fashioned ) diaeresis on words of latin/greek origin ( co\u00f6rdination , a\u00ebronautics ) ( to prevent them being pronounced as cewrdination or eeronautics ) . 
  ( this is famously still in use in the new yorker magazine , but a bit old-fashioned since the advent of the qwerty keyboard ) . 
  of course , there is our president , which is called fran\u00e7ois * hollande * . 
  i was actually thinking of [ henri becquerel 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_becquerel ) fortuitous discovery of radioactivity ( by having left a photographic plate unattended in the same drawer as a block of mineral that happened to be radioactive ) , which predate the curie 's works . 
  but yes , i will agree with you that marie curie , best curie ( well , maybe except for [ her daughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ir%c3%a8ne_joliot-curie ) ) . 
  the steam engine !, 
  invented by denis papin , but all the fame was stolen by james watt ( and hero of alexandria ) . 
  ( checking ) oooh , so antibiotics are indeed older than penicillin , wow !, 
  you forgot the first heavier-than-air flight :-) and also radioactivity ( which is as much of a fortuitous discovery as penicillin ) . 
  does it often happen that british summers are too hot ?

  the mayor of b\u00e9ziers ( fn ) complained about the number of kebab restaurants , who are not `` judeo-christian '' ( hah the code-words ) . 
  of course , a more thorough analysis shows that there are not that many kebab in b\u00e9ziers , and that they are not even the most numberous `` non-judeo-christian '' ( there are more east asian restaurants ) . 
  the mayor of b\u00e9ziers , a town in southern france , recently complained about the number of kebab restaurants in his town and them being non-judeo-christian .

  what i am pointing out is that `` law and order '' always have limits , and we should * always * keep them in mind , especially when going so far as to build fences or casually discuss lethal force . 
   one of the basic duties of the state is to uphold law and order , and this is just what ddr did by building the berlin wall .

   the report on security of e-voting in estonia is worrying , for sure , but not convincing enough for me . 
  it pretty much states that everything can be exploited and the whole thing should be shut down , instead of offering any improvements . 
  that 's the way research works in this domain . 
  researcher a publishes a protocol . 
  then researcher b proves that protocol a is flawed . 
  then researcher c ( which may or may not be equal to a or b or both ) publishes a fix . 
  in other words , they did they job fine by showing the weaknesses , but now somebody has to fix it . 
  since crypto has no mature answer for end-to-end verifiable voting , their opinion is that for now the best thing to do is to wait and shut down the system ( because a security risk in voting is completely unacceptable ) . 
  [ i am aware of this , and actually practice and teach it daily ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pgotu/bulgaria_holds_referendum_on_electronic_voting/cw6kao8 ) . 
  [ cryptography , whether symmetric or asymmetric , has no good answer to e-voting ] ( https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/346.pdf ) ( yet ) . 
  [ there are at least four plausible ways to attack the estonian system that crypto alone does not address . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pgotu/bulgaria_holds_referendum_on_electronic_voting/cw6m229 ), 
  i know the crypto to be weak because i read ( fast , this i admit ) the specs of the estonian e-vote ( the vote architects themselves rely on non-crypto security ) ; because peer-reviewed literature found the crypto to be weak ; because , to the best of my knowledge ( and this * is * my field of expertise ) , no satisfying solution exists ( yet ) . 
  what are you , a climate denier ? 
  i personnally saw the boxes from end to end , and the ballots in the hands of my co-participants . 
  i saw the count of the envelopes match the total number of crosses in the voter registration list . 
  i saw a negligible number of spoilt ballots , generally none of them being intentionnally tarred or anything . 
  ( i did not check the voter registration list , but this is independent from the mode of voting ) . 
  so yes , i have some good guarantees ; much more than e-voting does offer , where i did not monitor anything and i know the crypto to be weak .
