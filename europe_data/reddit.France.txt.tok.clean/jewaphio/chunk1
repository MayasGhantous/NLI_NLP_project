i 'm not saying their lineage does n't matter , i 'm saying they are not in a good position because they are aristocrat but because they come from wealthy families . 
  the fact that these families ' wealth originate in aristocracy or not is n't really important today . 
  you 'll have many people of aristocratic ascendance that has lost their wealth , many people from non aristocratic families that have been wealthy and influencial for generations . 
  now you happen to have quoted a few name of people that consider themselves aristocrats . 
  yes , they are one of the few i was referring to in my last paragraph . 
  they do not represent an influential movement , nobody takes them seriously about the aristocry thing . 
  if they have power it 's because they come from wealthy and established background . 
  philippe de villier ran for president once , with his monarchist party , he got 2.23 % of the vote . 
  people with `` de '' particule in their names are n't aristocrats . 
  they may descend from artistocrats but it has been abolished so long ago that nobody consider them aristocrats ( and aristocracy does n't exist in regard of the law ) . 
  now , i 'm not to say that there is n't a correlation between people with particule names and wealth . 
  but we would consider these people as part of rich bourgeois families , on par with other rich and influential families without particule names , not aristocrats . 
  there are a very few families that still claim to be aristocrat . 
  the few that do are notably the people in the direct lineage of the last kings , they sort of wish they could regain the throne one day , see [ henri d'orl\u00e9ans ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_d%27orl%c3%a9ans_ ( 1933 ) . 
  between themselves they will use titles like `` count '' or `` duke '' , but these titles hold no legal value . 
  they are n't taken seriously by anyone except themselves . 
  oh man , i thought i was in the thread `` what region in your country would you like to live in ? 
  '' , i was very perplexed by you answer, 
  personally i prefer coffee from a [ moka pot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moka_pot ) . 
  i used to drink it strong and short , but now i prefer it longer ( the size of a mug ) a not to strong . 
  never with sugar , i ca n't stand sugar in the coffee . 
  heey that 's so great because that 's exactly that goal you 're talking about that prompted my question !, 
  i think if it was france playing , they would not complain about getting the goal , but still recognize it should n't have been valid . 
  that 's this kind of answers i was hoping for !, 
  what about slavonia ? 
  paris region excluding inner paris . 
  yes , that 's well described . 
  in fact for many landscapes , i think people would be able to tell you in front of a picture that it is an iconic american landscape , however would not be able to tell a name or a geographic location . 
  you do n't get to choose what is in europe or not based on if you like the state and its politics and religions . 
  if i follow the logic from what you have written , you would be fine considering turkey `` european '' if it was democratic , secular and western friendly , but because it is not you do n't ? 
  so by that logic belarus is n't european , but australia is . 
  you see , it makes no sense . 
  on the contrary , what is interesting about turkey is that it is , if not strictly european , at least strongly tied to europe ( and you have to be ignorant of the history of europe to claim otherwise ) , and that it allows to put in perspective that europe is more diverse than just western aligned countries . 
  now may i ask , how does that bother you , to the point that it should be banned ? 
  i mean , i have n't seen many thread specifically targeted to turkey ( in fact none ) . 
  in a generic thread , what could be wrong with having , amongst the other answers , the perspective from turkey ? 
  i find it extremely interesting to have their input , especially because they are much more different compared to `` mainstream '' european countries , yet they are a reality of the european continent , both historically , geographically , and politically . 
  anyway , even if you disagree of the degree of `` europeanness '' of turkey , we all know it 's debated and you wo n't get all people to unilaterally declare that turkey is 0 % european . 
  so in the end , what is bad in having more than less ? 
  if you ca n't stand a turkish answer on a topic , just skip it ( you might even downvote it even if i find it rude ) , and let the others enjoy an extra point of view . 
  on the contrary , it sounds like the american to me . 
  at least , i know that when watching american series or movie with an australian character i ca n't tell apart a particular accent . 
  season 3 of orange is the new black is the exemple i have in mind . 
  not really . 
  i can tell the difference between american and british if they speak the `` standard '' accent of their respective countries , but otherwise no . 
  i never understood what the australian accent was .

  i think it 's the brussel situation that deters us from doing it . 
  no , but we sometimes fancy the idea of absorbing wallonia, 
  we use them , just as much as 5c coins, 
  what 's the difference between a black man and a tire ? 
  when you put chains on it , the tire do n't sing the blues . 
  2006 : italy-france 2016 : portugal-france, 
  but id checking is not automatic . 
  from my experience , the low-cost companies always do it , but i 've taken many france-germany flight with lufthansa and they did n't check nothing but my ticket . 
  in my experience it 's confined to certain areas . 
  i saw a lot of them in brittany , but i never saw one in my home region of dauphin\u00e9 . 
  germany , without doubt, 
  at least it 's not an eagle like every other country . 
  and it can be badass [ depending on the depiction ] ( http://lagauchematuer.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pr%c3%a9f%c3%a9rence-nationale.jpg ) , i like it very much !, 
  my bad , i was thinking of m\u00e9lenchon , but i mixed the places , he was born in morocco . 
  i do n't know if it counts for people born in algeria when it was still a part of france . 
  well what 's weird is that everybody speak of individual ambition as becoming rich . 
  i know no one whose ambition manifests in the goal of being filthy rich . 
  however i know ambitious people , they seek the best career possible in their field , but not because of money . 
  they want to be world class researchers , top civil servants , renowned artists ... 
  i do n't know about the rest of europe , but i 'd like to be in a region named alpine europe which would be : south eastern france , northern italy , switzerland and western austria . 
  all the different vowel sounds , especially the nasal ones . 
  there is about 14 different vowels . 
  take the name `` vincent '' for example , very few foreigners can pronounce it . 
  [ super dupont ] ( http://s1.lprs1.fr/images/2016/12/04/6412452_superdupont-nide-you.jpg ) of course !, 
  you do n't specify where in spain you go . 
  depending on west or east spain , it makes a differente route . 
  travel advice : be careful of the a7 highway , during the summer it can be really jammed . 
  that 's because it 's the only link between the north and the provence region ( very popular summer destination ) . 
  during the week day it should be okay , but avoid it during the weekends . 
  dijon is a perfect town for a one day stop . 
  there is a lot of beautiful architecture and history ( it was the capital of burgundy ) , but in the same time the town is not really big . 
  make sure to stop at the [ fallot mustard shop ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/4e/89/2f/la-moutarderie-edmond.jpg ) ( authentical mustard from burgundy ) , not the [ maille one ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/48/cd/e4/48cde44e37683fad1eb1ff3031b37a7e.jpg ) ( industrial mustard imported from canada ) . 
  lyon is amazing , albeit maybe too big for a short stop . 
  in one day you can visit the [ parc de la t\u00eate d'or ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parc_de_la_t%c3%aate_d%27or ) , or visit the historical center : from place des terreaux to place bellecour , the vieux lyon neighborhood , take the funicular to fourvi\u00e8re 's hill and the basilica . 
  regarding transportation : driving by car in the city is a pain in the ass , it 's long , there are n't many park place and it 's expensive . 
  you better park your car in one of the [ parc relais ] ( http://www.tcl.fr/en/discovering-tcl/discovering-tcl/park-ride ) in the outer city and take the public transportation . 
  what ? 
  north : butter south : olive oil, 
  sense of groove in music . 
  i 'm an amateur jazz musician , and in music there 's what you learn and practice during all your grown up life . 
  but there 's also what come from your cultural background , stuff that 's ingrained in you since you were born , like your mother tongue , or for example in music the fact that we use 12 notes ( in the west ) . 
  and culturally , europeans do n't groove for shit . 
  do n't get me wrong , you can overcome that with a ton of practice and immersion into the culture of the music you want to play , and nowadays , top european jazz players have nothing to envy to their american counterparts . 
  but i 'm convinced that americans have an advantage at grooving when they start . 
  ( note that i 'm not sure if it applies universally in american society , or more towards blacks , or idk what social classes that are exposed to jazz and deriving genres . 
  i remember seeing a post from an american asking why white people could n't clap the 2 & 4 beats ) . 
  yes , i do n't deny it 's not visible from certain specific points in lyon . 
  fourvi\u00e8re and croix-rousse are particular in that regard , since they raise high above the city and its surroundings . 
   le sud : a franco-italian guy who feels nostalgic . 
  nino ferrer is french-italian , but the song is about new caledonia,

  i 'm from lyon and grenoble area , so i can speak for this region .
