  unless you are in at a specific viewpoint , you do n't see the alps from very far . 
  the problem is that any small to medium obstacle between you and the alps will block you the view , so if you find the right post it is possible to see the alps , but it 's not a common sight from lyon . 
  [ another comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6ihzfn/visibility_of_the_alps_in_europe/dj6e17b/ ) posted a gmap link , from where you see the alps from the highway near lyon . 
  it works specifically there because the spot is a little high , and then the highway goes into a slight downward slope , straight in direction of the alps , with a flat landscape in front of you . 
  in the urban area of lyon , it 's just impossible , too many buildings or other obstacle , let alone ground altitude ( lyon is lower than its surroundings ) .

  finally , there 's the whole [ area of `` nord is\u00e8re '' ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.4775658,5.3985387,3a,75y,136.83h,82.71t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sojmw9hpluf5vb7vsd1rk-q!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo3.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dojmw9hpluf5vb7vsd1rk-q%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d179.16354%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) between lyon and the alps that has many hills . 
  so as soon as you 're in the hills , it 's not possible to see the alps anymore ( unless you 're in the right spot : on a side of the hill facing the alps and no other hill in your line of sight ) . 
  when travelling the highway between lyon and grenoble , you only have a permanent view of the alps [ after passing the town of colombe ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.3970996,5.4659469,3a,26.9y,164.06h,88.38t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shv1vhgk0k0u02j_lm9dioq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) .

  this one is well known in france , but i wonder if it is abroad . 
  it 's the highest sand dune in europe . 
  your article is nice , but i wanted to point that number 8 looks does n't look like provence at all . 
  in fact it looks a lot like brittany , which is culturally one of the ~ ~ culturally ~ ~ closest area to gb .

  `` wesh '' has two meanings : - `` wesh ! '', 
  means hi . 
  i would n't say this one is hated , at most it 's childish or ridiculous . 
  - `` un wesh '' designs an exuberant suburban young ( originally the kind of dude that would say `` wesh !, 
  '' ) , this one is used pejoratively . 
  it 's also used as a politically correct substitute for `` racaille '' which translates to `` riffraff '' ( according to my dictionary , however i 'm not sure if that reflects accurately ),

  if you ask for it : http://www.contefleur.fr/dossierjeux/france/depnomute/depnomuet.htm here 's my score http://imgur.com/a/0minw , could you guess where i 'm from ? 
  :p to be honest , toward the end it 's easy since there are less answers available, 
  i 'm taking no sides in this . 
  serbia and kosovo . 
  for one , because depending on who you ask , the borders are not the same . 
  i hope that the conflict will be resolved before the end of the century . 
  i think that by middle eastern standards they have their shit together , at least relatively to their other neighbors . 
  and that it 's a shame we do n't manage to have them on our side , because of ideological reasons . 
  yes they have a theocracy and human rights are bad there , but i do n't believe in western white-knighting in geopolitics , i think it 's just counterproductive . 
  for example we have no problem being allies with saudi arabia which is n't better . 
  actually for some predictable words it the same . 
  for example german words in '' - heit '' are the equivalent to french words in '' - it\u00e9 '' , and they are always feminine in both languages . 
  la table ( the table ) is feminine :p, 
  i do n't mind them . 
  after all when something 's part of your mother tongue it 's just the norm for you . 
  in fact i 'd be scared of a world with ungendered things . 
  i mean , a chair is feminine , a stool is masculine , how could this be different !, 
  this is madness !, 
  i disagree with this . 
  it seems complicated to us because it 's not a mechanism of our mother tongue . 
  languages without declension have to make up for this by using lots of preposition words ( do n't know what 's the technical term ) `` to '' , `` at '' , `` of '' , ... ( and i realized that in french there are tons of them ) . 
  it 's hard to have an unbiased opinion because of course i 'm familiar with the system of preposition and whereas the declension system is not natural . 
  however i think both systems have their perks , and i find the declension system to be more consistent and efficient . 
  i get that some people would prefer prepositions only , but still i would n't call declensions `` stupid '' . 
  interesting . 
  so does this mean that your school program is seen as more or less prestigious depending on your state ? 
  a.k.a do some state have better reputation when it comes to education program ? 
  to piggyback on this , i think the important distinction with other european mark systems , is that we do n't consider the grade to be a rank of assessment ( satisfactory , good , very good , ... ) , but that it is a fraction of the earned points over the total of available points for the test . 
  the most common total we use is in fact 20 , but in practice a teacher can decide to rank on whatever the total he wants . 
  often , the result is then scaled down to get a fraction over 20 because that 's the scale we 're the most used to . 
  however , we use other common totals . 
  10 is often used for short tests ( those with few exercises , in order to not make each exercise worth too much points ) . 
  40 is used for important and long tests , toward the end of high school and in higher education . 
  also another aspect is the coefficient of the grade . 
  in france ( i do n't know if that 's true elsewhere ) we focus a lot on the mean grade you can at the end of a semester for a given class , that is the mean of the grade you got for this class . 
  the thing is that these grades can have a different multiplying factor applied to them while calculating the mean ( that is the coefficient ) . 
  if the teacher says test a has a coefficient of 2 , whereas test b has only a coefficient of 1 , your mean grade will be ( scorea * 2 + scoreb ) / 3 . 
  a common way to reflect these coefficients is to use different totals for the grade . 
  thus a test graded over 10 points has implicitly ( but not automatically , it 's up to the teacher to clarify ) a coefficient worth half the coefficient of a test graded over 20 points . 
  finally we have an assessment system that is inferred from your final grade ( that is the official assessment system for the baccalaur\u00e9at , for everyday tests there is no official assessment ) . 
  for a grade over 20 points : - below 10 : failed - 12 to 14 : good enough - 14 to 16 : good - 16 to 18 : very good - 18 to 20 : you can get the congratulations of the examinations board ( but not automatically ), 
  i disagree with this , it depends on the subject . 
  for example in sciences , 20/20 are not uncommon . 
  typically , each exercise is worth an amount of point , and if everything is right you get 20 . 
  your statement is true for more subjective assignments , like an essay in literature , a presentation , ... 
  this is the theory . 
  in practice english is much more common as second language , and not all schools offer the curriculum to do german as a second language . 
  third language can be many languages , but again most schools only offer german , italian and spanish ( and english for the one with german as 2nd language ) , for a more particular language you 'll need to find the school that offers it . 
  you start the second language in `` 6\u00e8me '' , the grade of 11 years olds , and third language in `` 4\u00e8me '' , the grade of 13 years olds . 
  i feel she has good reputation only because she 's known for sticking it to the english , and since brexit there is resentment against them . 
  i 'd say the most common are : a catch-all asian shelf , a north african shelf , and tex-mex shelf , and an italian shelf ( but maybe for the last one that 's because i 'm from the east of france , near italy ) . 
  occasionally you can find more specialized shelves like portugal , spain , north american, 
  there are a lot of people of algerian descent in france in general . 
  and i say of algerian descent because most of them are french . 
  in general , there are many people in france that originate from our former colonies ( west africa and north africa ) . 
  furthermore we have , historically , a special relationship with algeria because it was legally not a colony ( like morocco , tunisia , senegal for example ) , but it was considered to be part of the french territory . 
  as a result , immigration from algeria was predominant , compared to the other colonies .
