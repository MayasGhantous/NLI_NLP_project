  but i wanted to react on the example of paris you used , which paradoxically does n't fit what you were asking about , imo . 
  paris is only overhelming in a political way , and slightly in a cultural way . 
  politically , means if you want to weight on the national scale you will , soon or later , have to go to paris ( i mean politically in the larger sense of the word , not only to be a politician ) . 
  and culturally , it 's not so that parisian culture is overtaking regional culture , but more the fact that national medias are biased with the parisian point of view . 
  also from my point of view it seems that parisians do n't really understand what 's the non-parisian french culture . 
  all in all , there is a divide between paris and the rest of france ( what i call the real france because i 'm petty :p ) . 
  if you leave paris apart , because it 's an outlier , france urban landscape is rather balanced . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_aires_urbaines_de_france ) there are 7 cities which metropolitan area 's includes more than 1m inhabitants . 
  economically speaking , while paris has more jobs opportunities , the living environment has many downsides compared to the rest of france ( some are incontestable like the price of housing and pollution , other are a matter of personal preference , but most people can only afford to live in the paris suburbs which is imo one of the worst place in france to live ) . 
  unless you particularly seek paris ' way of life ( and can afford it ) , or are stuck in a niche job were you ca n't find opportunities elsewhere , the rest of france is as attractive ( if not most for people like myself ) than paris . 
  i guess mail-order brides, 
  i believe they are the size of a credit card . 
  but i ca n't confirm , i have an old one too . 
  i do n't know if you can ask for switching , but i guess that if you loose yours , you will get the new format as a replacement . 
  i hope to keep mine as long as possible , because i was one of the last generations to have it , so it will become very rare when i 'm old , 
  for the driver license , you 're talking about the old one . 
  since 2013 ( 4 years already ) they look like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/recto-du-nouveau-permis.jpg?uselang=fr ), 
  yes, 
  [ i will survive - hermes house band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lddydmwl5zu ) it was the official song of the french football team in the 90s ' , and it became the anthem of our world cup victory in 1998 . 
  every french people born before the early 90s ' will get the chills hearing this song . 
  everybody on reddit is losing their mind about the media blackout supposedly because they ca n't debunk the leaks . 
  i think it 's the contrary , thanks to the media blackout , virtually nobody is talking about it . 
  social media are just echo chambers anyway , it will spread among le pen fans at most . 
  like others have said it was a horrible war . 
  and unlike ww2 where at least we can say that we fought against fascism , in ww1 people just fought for nothing but nationalist pride . 
  to me it 's really fascinating that the mindset of the time allowed this . 
  i can understand authoritarian empires ( germany , austria-hungary , russia ) going to war . 
  but democracies like france and the uk , it blows my mind . 
  maybe if jaur\u00e8s had n't be killed , the parliament would not have voted for the war . 
  anyway , i know that in this sub i 'm preaching for the choir , but that 's seriously why we need the eu . 
  i ca n't stand people getting petty on the eu because of economics stuff like maybe we could make a few more bucks if we were n't tied to the eu . 
  seriously , one century ago french people were willing to get slaughtered by millions just motivated by hatred of the germans . 
  the only reason it seems ridiculous nowadays is because of decades of effort at european integration . 
  last thing about ww1 in the french perspective , it 's also an ecological disaster . 
  a lot of the western front was on french soil . 
  there are villages that were just wiped out of the map , hills that were leveled out by artillery . 
  there are still areas that are unexploitable because of so many unexploded shells and chemical contamination in the soil . 
  see the [ zones rouges ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zone_rouge ) . 
  how what is viewed ? 
  ww1 as a whole , or american participation in ww1 ? 
  regarding american involvement , i would say it 's viewed as one event amongst others during the course of the war . 
  we know they joined the war in 1917 , tipping the scales in the allies ' favor a bit more , but also that at this time the allies were already taking the lead against germany . 
  so it 's not viewed as game changing like it is for ww2 . 
  do n't they have a huge problem of [ swimmer 's itch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swimmer%27s_itch ) though ? 
  `` orient '' is an old-fashionned term . 
  `` extr\u00eame-orient '' is not used in the modern speech , but when used it reflects a 19th century-ish feeling . 
  nowadays we will just refer to these regions as `` asia '' , `` south-eastern asia '' , `` china '' , `` japan '' , ... or whatever country we 're specifically talking about . 
  apart from `` moyen-orient '' i ca n't think of a modern use of this word . 
  `` oriental '' on the other hand is the adjective for `` eastern '' . 
  we do n't have an adjective built on the word `` est '' , thus it 's more used . 
  however it 's also falling out of fashion , in favor of `` de l'est '' ( literally `` of the east '' ) . 
  `` europe orientale '' vs . 
  it does not convey the same connotation . 
  `` east '' is literally `` est '' in french , not `` orient '' . 
  although both mean the same , you do n't use `` orient '' in everyday speech , yet it 's what is commonly used for the `` middle east '' expression . 
  which literally means `` medium orient '', 
   calling someone `` debil '' ( retard ) --  offender got defenestrated . 
  [ just czech things ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defenestrations_of_prague ), 
  france is the same order than you but we use the ' / ' =  dd/mm/yyyy . 
  it 's not uncommon to use only the two last digits of the year dd/mm/yy but i do n't like it . 
  well it only `` works '' for 15 years . 
  before that the elections were n't in sync , and we had several eras of `` cohabitation '' when the president had to appoint a pm from the opposite party because they held the parliament . 
  alright for making out , but being topless is not sexual in itself . 
  yes , it is actually planned to end on the 15th of july , but it has already been extended a few times ( notable after the nice attack ) so who knows , it could still last . 
  yes but the question was `` by european standards '' . 
  only far right european parties would support a platform that match the point of view of the average redditor concerning guns right , that was my point . 
  and reaching far right on some issues , like guns right , military worship , american notion of freedom of speech . 
  beautiful , you managed to cover every point i thought of , plus the rest . 
  for me when i think of england it 's the ipa, 
  between hamon and m\u00e9lenchon it 's a matter of charisma . 
  m\u00e9lenchon has the advantage to be indenpendant for a decade , and already had a good visibility from his campaign in 2012 ( where he finished 4th with a score of 11 % ) . 
  hamon had n't that much visibility on the national stage until now ( people heard of him , but he was still some guy of the ps ) . 
  also , m\u00e9lenchon appealed to `` true left '' people , that did n't like the fact that the governing part of the ps was the centrist faction . 
  however , because hamon is of the left-leaning faction , he is really close to m\u00e9lenchon in terms of voter base , and many people of the left wished they did an alliance in order to have only one strong candidate for the left . 
  until 2 weeks ago , they were both tied around 10 % in the polls , but m\u00e9lenchon managed to gain some momentum thanks to the tv debate ( and thanks to his charisma and the fact that his a well known figure in the political landscape ) . 
  right now i think he enjoys an effect of communicating vessels : to some left people , it does n't matter if it 's m\u00e9lenchon or hamon , they just want a left candidate with a chance to win . 
  now that m\u00e9lenchon broke the tie between him and hamon in the polls , more people are rallying him because he has the better odds . 
  to me what 's interesting is that the two traditional parties ( ps/socialists and lr/liberals ) are imploding due to the widening of the gap between their internal factions . 
  each party has a `` hard-line '' faction and a `` centrist '' faction , and in my opinion it makes no sense for them to be in the same party , however none of them would split because they would loose any chance to get a majority . 
  but right now i think we 've reached the breaking point . 
  for the ps : the current president hollande is from the `` centrist '' faction of the party , and has appointed the most right-leaning socialist as prime minister . 
  as a result , his presidency has been extremely unpopular because he managed to alienate half of his voter base ( the left-leanings ) with this choice ( plus the right that would have shit on him no matter what ) . 
  the ps was very weakened in this presidential race from the beginning . 
  however they held primaries to design the candidate , and hamon ( who is from the left-leaning faction ) got elected . 
  a lot of the `` centrist '' faction has refused to endorse him , or even openly supports the centrist candidate macron . 
  to me it 's the sign that this party does n't know where is heart is anymore , and there are two factions so irreconcilable that there are unable to unanimously support the winner of their primary . 
  it makes no sense to keep these people in the same party , it needs to be split in two . 
  for the lr : it 's more nuanced , but you see the same phenomenon . 
  during the primaries , the two main contenders were jupp\u00e9 ( centrist leaning ) and fillon ( right leaning ) . 
  fillon is really on the right , and while there has n't been as many official defection from his party than the ps , i think a part of the right voter base will be pushed toward macron ( the centrist candidate ) . 
  the best one would be quebec, 
  not with a great 'n', 
  ok but technically , how does it go ? 
  you come to the front desk showing your last phone bill ? 
  are the clerks aware of this specific arrangement ? 
  check [ mokra gora ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mokra_gora_ ( u % c5 % beice ) . 
  i have n't been there but according to a serbian friend it 's really nice , and you can make a stream train tour . 
  i did n't know it before , but now i badly want to see an american movie with a black character speaking conversational russian . 
  also , chirac refused to debate with le pen between the two rounds . 
  i doubt that 's a stunt the opponent of marine le pen will be able to do again .
