  ok i get it , thanks !, 
   so it works the same here , the only difference being that very few people pay for cable tv, 
  i 'm confused about what you refer by cable ? 
  you mean regular tv , or premium channels ? 
  here you have regular tv ( about 20 channels ) that are aired unencrypted so technically you can watch them without paying anything . 
  however , if you have a tv ( and thus have no technical limitation to get those channels ) , you should pay a yearly tax of 138 $ , or expose yourself to a fine if you 're controlled . 
  then you have premium channels , for which you need to pay a monthly subscription , it 's rather expensive . 
  but afaik almost nobody has them , only old people because they spend their days watching tv and have nothing better to do with their money . 
  regularly , maybe 3 times a week . 
  i do n't really pay attention . 
  it strikes me more when it 's the full face coverage ( i think it 's the niqab ) , but it 's rare ( i saw one yesterday , but i ca n't remember when the second last time was ) . 
  in france : most common engine is diesel , because the fuel has been subsidized by the government for decades ( not sure why ) . 
  i predict this trend will slowly change because of pollution issue with diesel that were brought to light in the last years . 
  we mostly drive small cars , because it costs less ( both insurance and fuel ) , it 's easier to drive in town and to find a place to park . 
  popular models are [ renault clio ] ( http://www.larevueautomobile.com//fiche-technique/photos/2006/renault/clio-3/renault_clio_3_005.jpg ) , [ peugeot 206 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/peugeot_206%2b_front_20100513.jpg/220px-peugeot_206%2b_front_20100513.jpg ) for example . 
  then there are family cars , like [ renault scenic ] ( http://pictures.topspeed.com/img/crop/200607/2006-renault-scenic-8_600x0w.jpg ) , or [ citroen picasso ] ( http://media.citroen.fr/image/32/4/.227324.png ) . 
  finally , people that want to carry big stuff around can have small utility vehicles like [ citroen berlingo ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c6/4b/31/c64b3137061c58a6c8817ec7b97e858d.jpg ) , or big utility vehicles like [ renault trafic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/renault_trafic_kombi.jpg ) . 
  i put only french brands because that the ones i 'm familiar with , but that 's to give you an idea of the type of vehicles . 
  you 'll find similars with other european or asian brands . 
  i pulled these examples out of my ass , because i could not quickly find nice data about cars popularity , only about best sales for a given year . 
  but given that many people keep their cars for years , and buy second hand cars , i think these rankings are not representative of what you 'll see on the streets . 
  honestly i do n't know ... to me all major problems of the us come from the general mindset of the population . 
  i mean , the glorification of individualism , belief in the american dream , decades of anti-socialism propaganda , puritanism ( glorification of guns and violence is ok , but do n't you dare showing that female nipple ) , the extremism of religious views ( and i mean this as well on the side of fundamentalists christians than the side of fundamentalists atheists ) ... so two things , for a long term shift of these things : - education , lots of it . 
  - reform of the political system to get rid of bipartism ( and hopefully make room for left parties , it 's wealthy to have a whole political spectrum represented ) . 
  parliamentary systems like germany 's are the best in my opinion . 
  only with pork, 
  it 's not widespread but a few polling place use machines ( mine does , i 've voted with a machine since 2011 ), 
  1 - he 's a right wing candidate , so guessing from this sub demographics you have a high chance of speaking to someone that align with the left . 
  2 - even among the right , he is very on the right of the spectrum ( think thatcher ) . 
  3 - he ran his campaign on the premise he was a clean candidate ( we have an history in france of right wing candidates being caught in affairs , chirac , sarkozy , ... ) , but for 2 month he 's being incriminated for fictional work for when he was in the parliament . 
  he 's approval rating has dropped since then , he has refused to step down although a decent part of the right called for it . 
  more importantly , this has been brought to light by the media , and he has directly attacked the legitimacy of the media , this is not something we take kindly to . 
  4 - according to the polls , he 's now too far behind to get to the second round . 
  however , were it to happen , he has lost so much legitimity , that i can see lepen winning against him . 
  i think it applies for every french city outside of the paris area . 
  i tested with lyon , second biggest city , according to google maps , [ 20km by car ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/dir/45.7581736,4.8340887/45.7356362,4.6579575/@45.7365322,4.6644444,14.75z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0 ) is enough to land in the small village of [ vaugneray ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/5083349.jpg ), 
  - \u00c9glise sainte-marie for your first example . 
  you can build each exemple with this templace : `` \u00c9glise saint ( e ) - [ french_name ] '' . 
  `` saint '' for masculine , `` sainte '' for feminine . 
  we also use `` cath\u00e9drale '' and `` basilique '' instead of church if needs be . 
  yes please do n't mix up the left and the right !, 
  or stick close to the center , you 'll be less likely to make a mistake :p, 
  woah !, 
  britons doing something on the correct side ? 
  where were you bot , when they were speaking in lbs ? 
  yes we do, 
  also , watch them not dubbed but with subtitles . 
  well , centuries of propaganda by the successive regimes in order to establish their legitimacy has led our collective mind to associate many people of the past as `` us '' . 
  for the monarchy ( you know how monarchy is obsessed with lineage ) , the first french king is [ clovis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clovis_i ) ( in fact a frankish king ) . 
  so starting with the franks of the 5e century , it 's `` us '' . 
  totally us . 
  nevermind that a good part of his empire became the hre , that 's something your average frenchman has not heard of . 
  in fact , unless one is versed into german culture , the average frenchman has no idea that karl der gro\u00dfe , a.k.a charlemagne , is a major german historical figure . 
  but then we had the republic , that needed to flip the table and discredit everything linked to the monarchy . 
  and you know how republic is obsessed with * the people * . 
  so they decided that while the franks and the romans might be in the lineage of the noblemen , real ancestors of the people were the gauls . 
  so for the main part of the 19e century , there 's a strong incentive to promote this narrative . 
  the famous sentence `` nos anc\u00eatres les gaulois '' which would figure in history textbooks , and which has been jokingly used by the asterix comicbooks . 
  so this is still a big part of our collective mind . 
  when we think of the battle of alesia ( gallic leader vercingetorix is defeated by caesar ) , we think of it as a defeat . 
  finally , the great thing with the gauls , is that we do n't know when they start , so there is not really a time when it was n't `` us '' on the soil of france . 
  you invent a word for everything , do n't you ? 
  surname in all caps , it 's something we do mostly on forms , listings , maybe in legalese texts . 
  but when it 's within a `` narrative '' ( for lack of better word ) text we do n't . 
  [ this article for example ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2017/article/2017/03/10/entre-macron-et-hamon-les-faux-semblants-de-la-bataille-des-soutiens_5092301_4854003.html ) , you see they write it the normal way `` bertrand delano\u00eb '' , `` claude bartolone '' , ... 
  funny experiment i just did : [ all post tagged as questions on / r/france ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/search?q=flair%3a%27orange%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on ) =  every title written in english ( arguably non french speakers ) has no space before the '' ? 
  '' , every title in french has . 
  something that seems to be exclusive to french : every punctuation sign formed with two symbols ( that is '' ; '' , '' : '' , '' ? 
  must be preceded by a ( non breaking ) space !, 
  it 's very weird for me to read stuff written without it , it feels odd . 
   what do you use for quotations ? 
  it should be `` what do you use for quotations ? '' . 
  oui [ ouiche ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrgraeaxkas ) you eumeri krismeus !, 
  not that it 's especially popular , but i think everybody had to sing that one at least once in school , phonetically , not understanding what it said ( and to foreign ears , that recurring `` oui ouiche '' sounds ridiculous as fuck ) edit : [ found a version !!, 
  :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qnk2hpxkzo ) edit2 : [ another one ! ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noddvonisva ) . 
  well it seems that someone got briefed on that ` h ' . 
  contacts , sms , phone call and the alarm clock . 
  ca n't wait for the fifth star , to stick it to the italians ( i 'm still mad for 2006 ), 
  a fun fact regarding richard is that he spent almost all his live in aquitaine and did n't speak english . 
  i think it really put into perspective that when we think of the english/french rivalry of the middle ages ( and especially the hundred year war ) , it was more a thing between two french leaders both wanting to be the real king of france . 
  haha we count charles le chauve et louis le gros count as our leaders two  ( well not surprising when you think about it ), 
  why am i not suprised ? 
  in france we say that italy was introduced , so that scotland would n't always loose . 
  is the joke also prevalent in the uk ? 
  also it 's not followed by the same social classes , rugby being more popular in upper middle class ( i 'd say ... ) . 
  rugby appeals to people that do n't like the fact that there 's too much money and too much whining in football ( not my opinion , i love football ) . 
  i think it 'll be weird when the queen dies . 
  she was already queen when my mother was born ... what if the next monarch is a king ?? 
  i do n't know if i can live in a world where it 's not the * queen * of england . 
  it 's popular among long time smokers , from the middle class , who use it as an alternative to stop smoking . 
  i know a dozen of people that fit into this category . 
  people vaping because it 's hype , none . 
  [ s63 by france t\u00e9l\u00e9com ] ( http://www.annees-80.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/telephone-annees-80.jpg ), 
  depends on the context . 
  personally i differentiate proper english and lingua franca english . 
  if i planned to integrate in an english-speaking country i 'd want to learn the former and thus would care a lot about being corrected . 
  but if i just talk english as a mean to be understood by an international audience , i do n't care that much as long as the mistakes are n't big enough to cause misunderstanding . 
  i can say this because when i lived in germany , i put a lot of effort in learning german , trying to spot all mistakes and finding out how to speak german that sounded natural . 
  but talking perfect english on an internet forum , meh ... 
  the kebab sandwich ( or d\u00f6ner kebab ) was invented in berlin by germans of turkish descent .
