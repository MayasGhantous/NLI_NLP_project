  anyway , i 'm from lyon here we eat [ tacos kebab ] ( http://le-tacos-de-grenoble.fr/img/bibliotheque/demandes-speciales9.jpg ), 
  piss them off by sending them californian wine that ranks higher than french wine :p, 
  germany 's parliamentary system over our presidential system . 
  all seasons of grey 's anatomy in one year . 
  i 'm not proud . 
  a note regarding your statement `` considering their past '' : in western europe , communists parties were never in power ( afaik ) and their past is not the one of the ussr . 
  i wo n't debate whether they 're good or bad , but you should know that the ussr was one implementation of communism , and not every communist party aim to reproduce that implementation . 
  on the contrary , their past grant them some prestige , since they were one of the most dominant and effective group in the resistance against the nazis during ww2 . 
  he would die from old age before the end of the trial . 
  definitely seen as a hero . 
  even if we are aware of the bad things , it 's easily forgotten due to the fact that he 's an historical figure , not a modern one . 
  i find it similar to the way people remember genghis khan for exemple . 
  although brexit wo n't be immediate , the uk is not a great long-term investment if you plan to integrate as a eu citizen . 
  i was going to say the exact opposite , weird !, 
  i 'd say most common '' \u00c9tats unis '' , then `` les us '' / `` les states '' , and finally `` l'am\u00e9rique '' but that last one is connoted oldschool . 
  cat . 
  that eating raw pork is very dangerous and can cause you to get a tapeworm . 
  on the other hand we have no problem with raw beef . 
  but according to [ karambolage ] ( http://sites.arte.tv/karambolage/fr ) raw pork is no more dangerous than raw beef , if less . 
  and that seems to be something proper to the french , and that the germans eat raw pork with no problem . 
  the term used to be 7 years long , it was reduced to 5 years in 2002 . 
  in my opinion i liked 7 years better . 
  the problem with short terms is that they spend too much time focusing on being reelected rather than doing a non partisan job . 
  the president usually begin to focus on his reelection 1 year before , that means he spends 20 % of his term in half governing/half campaigning mode . 
  the worst example of this is the us , where they have a tiny term of 4 years , and elections campaign that take forever because of the primaries . 
  unless you plan to go to the countryside in a non tourist spot , you wo n't need a car . 
  big cities are not designed for cars , it will be slower and a lot more expensive to park it . 
  use public transportation it 's great . 
  serbia , really bad road quality , even on the motorway . 
  like , you 're in croatia everything 's fine , pass the border and suddenly * bump * * bump * it 's serbia . 
  for the tolls it 's a matter of philosophy . 
  it 's more expensive but the quality of the motorways is great ( the road and the rest areas ) . 
  if i remember correctly , germany has free motorways but the roads were less pleasant to drive on . 
  i only use the glorious french pronunciation !, 
  the hardest are the nasal vowels , i found this [ concise video showing them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kij6wx4mqk4 ) . 
  so far i 've seen no foreigner that was at ease with them ( be their language english , german , slavic , arabic , ... ) . 
  next are the `` u '' and `` eu '' sound . 
  german has them so it 's more common , that would be '' \u00fc '' and '' \u00f6 '' . 
  there 's also the subtility that `` o '' and `` eu '' have two variants . 
  ( it 's similar to english ` o ' `` some '' vs `` also '' ) . 
  `` o '' can be / o / or / \u0254 / . 
  `` eu '' can be / \u0153 / or / \u00f8 / . 
  this one is less of a problem , when you consider that it 's not consistent between the regional french accents . 
  learning the standard/parisian way would be preferable though . 
  i did n't specifically choose that brand , because i looked for second hand cars , that 's the one that was available the right time fitting my requirements . 
  i was also looking at similar models from skoda , peugeot , fiat , citroen . 
  i specifically avoided renault though . 
   the biggest sports match on the planet is the world cup final and you that 's the most important because you do n't even say what sport it 's the world cup of , it 's just * the * word cup . 
  what 's often strikes me with non-native speakers , is that they completely miss the subtility of our vowel sounds ( i think we have more than a dozen different vowels ) . 
  but on the other hand i see no one brings this up . 
  so i 'm curious , non-native speakers , is it something you are aware of ? 
  maybe it 's personal ( and it does n't help that my name contains exclusively those vowels you do n't / ca n't hear ) , but i think it 's the most akward trait of a foreign accent . 
  other stuff like not saying the correct ` r ' , or sometimes pronouncing a silent letter are less inconvenient . 
  i think it 's deeply cultural . 
  pronouncing a single word of another language in its accent , in the middle of a french sentence , sounds ridiculous . 
  idk how to describe but it 's unnatural and you sound like a goof , and you can feel the social pressure of sounding like a goof saying it . 
  you may say a whole english sentence in english accent it 's fine , switching accent mid sentence for a single word that 's to weird for us . 
   i had always angry been , that you the verb at the end to put have . 
  that 's the way they do it :p, 
  how to decline pronouns in `` ein '' ( so ein , kein , mein , ... ) and also how to decline adjectives . 
  but i do n't know why with the '' - ein '' pronouns i 'm never sure . 
  and about adjectives , like `` sch\u00f6n '' for example . 
  can you use `` sch\u00f6n '' as it is , or is it always `` sch\u00f6ne '' or `` sch\u00f6nen '' ? 
  and when is what ? 
  i wish one day western democracies switch to a ranking voting system or a range voting system . 
  in the mean time , we can only be glad that our system is less fucked up than in the us . 
  yup , but even if they 're not commonly used by native speaker , i can still infer them , use them and sound posh with my knowledge of advanced vocabulary :p, 
  sense of groove in music . 
  i 'm an amateur jazz musician , and in music there 's what you learn and practice during all your grown up life . 
  but there 's also what come from your cultural background , stuff that 's ingrained in you since you were born , like your mother tongue , or for example in music the fact that we use 12 notes ( in the west ) . 
  and culturally , europeans do n't groove for shit . 
  do n't get me wrong , you can overcome that with a ton of practice and immersion into the culture of the music you want to play , and nowadays , top european jazz players have nothing to envy to their american counterparts . 
  but i 'm convinced that americans have an advantage at grooving when they start . 
  ( note that i 'm not sure if it applies universally in american society , or more towards blacks , or idk what social classes that are exposed to jazz and deriving genres . 
  i remember seeing a post from an american asking why white people could n't clap the 2 & 4 beats ) . 
  on the other hand , it 's all natural for us to speak at least 2 languages , when they are stuck in their monolingual universe . 
  i remember when i was a child , it totally blew my mind that some people were able to speak another language . 
  i imagine americans ( and britons ) being stuck in that state of bewilderment for all their lives . 
  also being french is cheating . 
  english is super easy for us to learn , [ since 2/3 of the vocabulary can be inferred from french ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/origins_of_english_piechart.svg/677px-origins_of_english_piechart.svg.png ), 
  thank god no , that 's how you end up with an obese population !, 
  i 'm glad the government just made it illegal here . 
  i think the key is * elected * , that way you put napol\u00e9on out of the window . 
  napoleon iii was elected as the 1st president of newly founded 2nd republic ( in 1848 ) , only to end it 4 years later by a coup making him emperor . 
  i would support solid pression from the eu on the us . 
  however i think a travel ban is not the smart move . 
  there are n't much stereotypes in regards to the french swiss . 
  the only i can think of is that they are a bit slow , that is reflected by their accent . 
  but otherwise not much , compared to the french belgian that we poke a lot of fun at . 
  can you explain what you mean by `` total disaster '' ? 
  you would be too , if your country and culture were so much superior . 
  more like `` eliz '' , with the ipa \\ e.liz \\, 
  written `` \u00c9lise '' though, 
  this speech gives me chills, 
  germany . 
  best friends since 1963, 
  you mean our tunnel ? 
  i think france leans toward pro-palestinian , although it 's a dividing issue . 
  can confirm , went to serbia , they are obsessed with meat . 
  you can see it the other way around .
