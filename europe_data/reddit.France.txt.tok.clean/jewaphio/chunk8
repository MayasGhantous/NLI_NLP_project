  you can easily follow a football game , you just have to know that they are trying to push the ball into the goal with their feet . 
  rugby you need to be explained some basics otherwise it 's confusing . 
  honestly , i hope you 're exposed to the candidate before being in front of your ballots !, 
  there is always big displays in front of the polling stations with the official poster of each candidate , like [ those ones ] ( http://i.f1g.fr/media/ext/805x453_crop/www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2014/05/12/pho54878712-d9df-11e3-8f2c-6155ec2bb7ba-805x453.jpg ) . 
  these are the official displays , put in place by the municipalities . 
  as you can see they are numbered , and before the election each party is randomly assigned a display number thus the order of display is the same everywhere . 
  there are so many things i love about germany , that is one of those . 
  the ability to have reasonable politics , and parties capable of coalition ... maybe i romanticize it too much , but i which france was more like germany in some ways . 
  concerning how the public view the politicians . 
  i 'd say it 's currently morose . 
  the two strong parties are the socialist party for the left , which has been a continuous major political force since the beginning of the 20th century . 
  and for the right there is the newly renamed `` les r\u00e9publicains '' party ( but nothing to do with the american notion of `` republican '' ) , which is in the tradition of the succesive major right parties that have replaced each other since the party of charles de gaulle , which founded our political system . 
  ( history of parties of the right is less monolithic than those of the left ) . 
  the two last president are the less popular of the history of our regime ( as a reminder : which starts in 1958 ) . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but i remember reading data stating that . 
  the one from the right , sarkozy , which was so unpopular at the end of his mandate that we elected the socialist hollande ( in france that 's very hard for a socialist to get elected , we only got one socialist president apart from him , and holland charism is less than stellar ) . 
  now hollande is at the end of his mandate , and has breaken the record of unpopularity that had been set 5 years earlier by sarkozy . 
  the election is next year , and we are in the process of primaries for the lr party ( right ) , where sarkozy in one of the major contender . 
  so like in the us ( althought not as extreme ) the people are a bit fed up with the establishment and the political class that fails to renew itself . 
  one major consequence is the raise of the far-right party `` front national '' , which is a nationalist anti-european party , and has got bigs scores in elections for the last decade . 
  one of the key element of their rethoric is that all politicians from major parties , be it left or right are `` all the same '' . 
  it is not unlikely that the next presidential election will be between the candidate of the traditional right party , and the one of the far-right . 
  i also feel that people are uncomfortable with the current political landscape of parties ( at least i am ) . 
  the traditionnal strong party of the left has been the socialist party for almost a century . 
  however the mandate of hollande has seriously weakened them and highlighted strong dissent within the party . 
  hollande and his governement are really center-leaning , and many believer of a `` true left '' policy are very disappointed ( the voters , but also many politician among the socialist party . 
  several of his ministers have resigned after a few years because of this ) . 
  to me it looks like the dissent you got among your democratic party , between sanders and clinton followers . 
  ( note that however , france political 's spectrum is more on the left that the us ' , so maybe sanders which is on the left of the democratic party is more aligned with hollande which is on the right of the socialist party ) . 
  on the right i think there is also a problem . 
  historically the right was `` gaulliste '' , that is inherited its ideology from charles de gaulle , a mix of conservatism , patriotism , and promotion of social welfare ( \u00e0 la european ) . 
  since the last decades there are more neoliberalists ( warning : liberal in europe means economically liberal , something of the right , not the left ) , and since the last elections some of their policians are trying to appeal at people voting for the far-right , and have made their position more extreme . 
  so i feel that within the party the spectrum has widened , on the left the one who are sticking to traditionnal gaullist views , on the right some that go really far in the direction of the speech of the front national . 
  this represent my personnal view on all of this . 
  it is certainly biased , althought i tried to not be too partisan . 
  maybe fellow frenchmen will disagree and i encourage you to take their opinion into account too . 
  concerning the ballots : they are neutral . 
  you have one ballot per candidate , [ that is only a white paper with the name of the candidate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/france_%c3%a9lections_pr%c3%a9sidentielles_6_mai_2012_bulletins_de_vote_second_tour.jpg/286px-france_%c3%a9lections_pr%c3%a9sidentielles_6_mai_2012_bulletins_de_vote_second_tour.jpg ) , and you put the one you want to vote for in the envelop and throw the others . 
  and in certain places ( that 's the case in my town ) we vote with an [ electronic machine ] ( http://www.ville-coueron.fr/files/00/00/05/00000588-b50c7df003de808a8f4005a6d6fdd2a40ca7e32c/urne%20electronique.jpg ) . 
  as you can see that 's the same , only names on white background . 
  edit : i should specify , that this is for the presidential elections . 
  not all elections follow this styleguide , but i ca n't tell exactly which . 
  what i 'm sure is that it 's always several papers and you put the paper of the person/list you vote for in the enveloppe . 
  but for the last european elections for example , we voted for lists thus it was more packed and there was a logo , [ like this ] ( http://decroissance.lehavre.free.fr/europennes14/bv-nord-ouest.jpg ), 
  i misread your flair as `` belgium '' and i was like `` really ? 
  surprising we do n't hear them brag much about that '', 
  french , because as it has already be said dialects are almost non-existant in france , at least i 've never been exposed to in my region . 
  however , in big cities it 's not uncommon to hear arabic ( algerian i think ) on the streets . 
  maybe i should learn the language one day, 
  while i understand the militant aspect of it , is it something you regret , to have been able to know a major foreign language ? 
  around 1 $ for 200g bag , if you take a distributor 's brand . 
  marketed brands a little bit more , between 1 $ and 1 $ 50 . 
  entry level can be less than 1 $ . 
  that is in france , not paris . 
  the materazzi of this decade, 
  in france [ that is a sandwich ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/jahoo/jahoo0805/jahoo080500008/3024413-foot-sous-marin-long-sandwich-au-jambon-fromage-suisse-laitue-tomates-et-concombres-vue-d-en-haut-is-banque-d'images.jpg ), 
  open face as in you only have [ half a bread ] ( http://img.fac.pmdstatic.net/fit/http.3a.2f.2fwww.2efemmeactuelle.2efr.2fvar.2ffemmeactuelle.2fstorage.2fimages.2fcuisine.2frecettes-de-cuisine.2fla-tartine-avocat-chevre-et-sesame-en-video.2f13900725-2-fre-fr.2fla-tartine-avocat-chevre-et-sesame-en-video.2ejpg/600x450/crop-from/center/la-tartine-avocat-chevre-et-sesame-en-video.jpeg ) . 
  one time i 've encountered a debate on the use of `` open face sandwich '' ( i do n't remember what the dispute was exactly , but something like it 's stupid because once it 's open face it 's not a sandwich anymore ) . 
  i realized the debate made no sense for me because in french we call this a * `` tartine '' * . 
  and i 'm not hundred percent sure there 's no equivalent in english , but i did not find a translation in my dictonary . 
  i crossed the border this summer . 
  maybe i missed it , but i remember strugling deciphering the italian sign because i could n't find the english one . 
  i am very insterested in finding a similar statistic for france but i still have n't found . 
  however in my search i found that the french banks call real credit cards `` postponed debit cards '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the notion of credit card in france is absent of the public awareness . 
  yes this !, 
  do n't miss the last gas station before entering the slovenian highway , because when your at the gate it 's too late . 
  by the way , [ this is the logo of the toll sticker ] ( http://www.dars.si/dokumenti/3_vinjete/vinjeta%20-%20pamphlet.jpg ) , useful because when i crossed the border from italy there was no sign in english . 
  credit cards are almost inexistant in france . 
  everybody says `` credit card '' , but it just means `` bank card '' , in fact everybody has a debit card . 
  i did n't even know what real credit cards were before i saw a reddit discussion about it . 
  wait what ? 
  you do n't pronounce ` h ' in hour ? 
  but actually it still has an impact on pronounciation in certain cases . 
  at the beginning of words there are to types of ` h ' : `` aspirated h '' and `` mute h '' . 
  when speaking , we pronounce a liaison between the words if a word begin with a vowel . 
  that is , the last letter of the preceding word , which is often not pronounced , is pronounced if you follow with a word beginning by a vowel . 
  seperately , `` les '' is pronounced \\ le \\ , `` animaux '' is pronounced \\ a.ni.mo \\ , but altogether you 'll say \\ le.za.ni.mo \\ \\ . 
  with words beginning with an aspired h you do n't do the liaison , those with a mute h you do . 
  example : - `` h\u00f4pitaux '' \\ o.pi.to \\ ( mute h ) , `` les h\u00f4pitaux '' \\ le.zo.pi.to \\ - `` haricots '' \\ a.\u0281i.ko \\ ( aspired h ) , `` les haricots '' \\ le.a.\u0281i.ko \\ edit : corrected ipa , thanks / u/dtstump, 
  well , what do * you * think ? 
  i did n't hear of it before now , and i 'm not versed at all in italian politics . 
  the french word `` vasistas '' referring to [ this kind of small window ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/purnea_sordjo%c3%bb.jpg ) , comes from the german `` was ist das ? '', 
  ( what is it ? 
  ) , because they would ask the question through the window before opening the door . 
  probably he foresaw that the alternative was subjugation to germany . 
  i know it 's so ingrained in your society and philosophy that hardly anything can be done about it , but looking at the statistics of firearm related deaths is really sad . 
  copy/paste my comment from another thread : although it 's not the stuff liked by the youngster nowadays , i really love claude nougaro , for the poetry of the lyrics and the jazz in his music ( good integration of jazz in french music in quite rare , since it 's not really prevalent in our culture ) . 
  - [ c\u00e9cile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izwmyglx2ak ) - [ dansez sur moi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5o-7efkwby ) ( girl talk ) - [ sing sing song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7dv8nifhmu ) ( work song ) on a totally different style , ivorian reggae singer tiken jah fakoly . 
  he mostly uses simplistic , but committed lyrics and the songs are really catchy . 
  - [ plus rien ne m ' \u00e9tonne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emrxcac3s5g ) - [ africain \u00e0 paris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koipgbfywym ) ( englishman in new york ), 
  a lot !, 
  that 's almost part of the democratic process here . 
  - we elect someone nobody 's really satisfied with because of bipartism . 
  - the way our constitution is done , the guy elected hold almost absolute power for 5 years unless the parliament is against him ( unlikely since we vote for the parliament the same year than for the president ) - each time the government push some unpopular reform , we go on strike and sometimes it yield some results . 
  striking has for a long time been a thing of the left , but since the presidency of hollande ( so called `` socialist '' ^ ( i 'm not biased at all ) ) there has been striking from the right ( especially against gay marriage ), 
  each year on the 11th of november there are official commemorations . 
  in each town , the mayor and other officials will gather at the war memorial ( you find those in each village , with the list of people of the village dead at war ) for a ceremony . 
  i had to attend many of those many of those younger because i played in the town orchestra . 
  it would be fine by me if it was some kind of remembrance for the human waste that the war was , but speechs were way too braggy on how we won the war and the honor of people dead for the glory of france .
