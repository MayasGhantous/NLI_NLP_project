  1968 : a huge strike ( 11 millions ) that changed the country forever . 
  protests against capitalism , consumerism , american imperialism , traditional institutions values and order . 
  it was a huge social revolution that is still talked about/felt to this day . 
  so , since the results were pretty good , workers are still going on strike when they feel they are not treated fairly , because history showed us that it can be done . 
  i would not want to be in a country without healthcare/gay rights so that limits the choices . 
  how am i supposed to know ? 
  you use the catalonia flair it 's only normal that i would assume that you are for a spanish + french catalonia merge so it can become its own thing . 
  it would be an acceptable opinion to have lol, 
  huh ??? 
  you 're the one that said that we should give back `` french catalonia '', 
  alright , that seems more accurate , 
  the `` french catalonia '' or catalonia becoming a country . 
  it 's not like in spain where your voice is heard . 
  no one knows about it/cares here . 
  if people know about it they know of what 's going on in spain , but there is no big movement/debate in france about this . 
  no , only 1/4 of the people living in the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es orientales can speak catalan , so 25 % ... [ source ] ( http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.demolinguistica.cat%2fweb%2findex.php%3foption%3dcom_content%26task%3dview%26id%3d97%26itemid%3d77%26lang%3dca_es ) . 
  i do n't know how we go from 25 % in 2004 to your 70 %, 
  i 'm just saying , in france this is not a conversation at all . 
  only for the catalonians from spain lol, 
  and they make wine too !, 
  same time too ? 
  bruh , we try to tell people the french fries are belgian every chance we get , come on now . 
  it 's at 13h and 20h . 
  at 13h it 's 3/4 of random stuff like `` look at that village where people make 3000 years old traditional curtains '' . 
  at 20h it 's `` normal '' news . 
  but i think more and more people skip that now and just watch the 24/24 news channels . 
  i 'm not a fan . 
  is there mountains at the new switzerland/france border ? 
  my answer is purely based on culture/language , not economy obviously , 
  wallonia i guess but it would mess up our hexagonal shape ... 
  what do you mean by the social power ? 
  i think you can read between the lines when reading the laws and see what was probably going on at these times but it 's hard to know what the social changes were like ( without being an historian , and i 'm not :p ) for what it 's worth , i can tell you that on my father 's side , the family has n't been religious in a long long time . 
  but is it an exception or not , i do n't know . 
  i 'm not sure we can assume anything from war diaries though , of course people would tend to be more religious in these circumstances . 
  1794 : the first separation between the state and the church . 
  it was during the french revolution and the creation of the first republic . 
  the law said that the republic ca n't give money to any religion . 
  this lasted until 1801 , when napol\u00e9on was ruling . 
  he made a deal with the pope of the times so that revolutionaries and catholics could make peace with each other , that was called the `` concordat of 1801 '' . 
  napol\u00e9on was in charge of picking the bishops and the church finances , the church did n't get their lands back . 
  the concordat stated that catholicism was the religion of the majority of the french people but not the official state religion . 
  this lasted until 1905 with the law we have now ( except for alsace-moselle who is still under the concordat , that was part of the deal with germany so we could get alsace-moselle back in 1919 . ), 
  that one was written during the iiird republic and established state secularism , neutrality of the state , freedom of religion and all that stuff . 
  apparently it 's dvb-t , but almost no-one uses it . 
  we just pay for an internet box and they give you a tv box with it and that 's how we get our channels . 
  before that we could get free channels with an antenna but it stopped working a few years ago . 
  people can still get a cheap digital terrestrial television box if they do n't need the internet ( and if their tv is old ) . 
  most french people get their tv channels with the internet provider . 
  getting a satellite and all that stuff is just too much trouble , the only people doing it are the immigrants that want to be able to see their channels . 
  i really have no interest in the bbc ... 
  ah yeah i was n't sure . 
  the only difference with us is the summer vacation then , it 's the same for everyone . 
  only for kids and students . 
  for adults you can take them whenever you want . 
  as long as the law is not equal for all there is no equality , simple as that . 
  civil unions is a first step , so society can get used to the idea , but after a while it becomes unacceptable . 
  yes , it 's the only one available . 
  ( for me anyway , other providers might have more i have no idea ), 
  no , i watched it ( bbc world ) for the first time 2 days ago ... 
  i just watch french news channels and sometimes hala gorani on cnn international . 
  i 'm all for esa conquering space . 
  first stop should of course be europa . 
  the word vocational is not appropriate , of course most teachers are doing it by vocation . 
  but if by `` vocational '' you mean a different `` branch '' of school , then no pedagogy jobs do n't fit in this definition i do n't think . 
  it 's more for like being a baker , mechanic , butcher etc. 
  basically anything manual . 
  i do n't know if i understood exactly what you wanted to know so sorry if this is was off base lol, 
  would n't that be part of `` not roman '' though ? 
  no it 's 100 % unknown, 
  i saw that too the other day on / r/europe , very cool indeed !, 
  the [ chauvet ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/chauvethorses.jpg?uselang=fr ) cave - 33 000 years ago , the best and oldest preserved paintings in the world . 
  the [ lascaux ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/lascaux_painting.jpg ) cave - 17 000 years ago - hundreds of paintings . 
  also way more recent and i think something a lot of people do n't know , there 's still parts of the lutetia ( paris ) [ arena ] ( http://www.coolstuffinparis.com/photos/arenes_de_lutece/arenes_de_lutece1_650.jpg ) ( from the 1st century ) visible today in paris . 
  i only specified because it happened all over europe . 
  also the word itself does n't agree with you , 
  yes . 
  i guess we should take it as a compliment , it 's also good comedic fodder , 
  all of them , i do n't know that much about anybody else 's country :(, 
  truly the wurst sentence you can tell a french person . 
  a real turn off lol, 
  well it 's kind of rude but ok . 
  stop pressuring that fine gentleman !, 
  i wish they would do it . 
  the symbolism is perfect and it 's way prettier than bruxelles . 
  you mean the french renaissance right ? 
  op said we could n't cite our own countries , 
  italians , portuguese and spanish people speaking french , in that order . 
  edit : germans speaking french sound cute too . 
  obligatory voltaire joke : not holy not roman and not an empire, 
  italy for me , because of the roman empire . 
   we do n't necessarily want to cram the trip full of things to do , but more look for helpful pointers . 
  that 's what it looks like to us . 
  you 're gon na end up being very tired , staying in hotels a few nights , traveling again , taking planes ( and it takes hours even if the flights are short ) , taking cabs to go to hotels , rushing to see everything you want to see . 
  all that stuff is `` wasting your time '' as you said , and kind of stressful  as / u/ercarret suggested , you should pick 2 cities you really want to see , this way you can really get a feel for the place . 
  concerning the weather , since you are from canada you should be fine , i do n't know what `` normal winter cold '' is for you but it 's probably colder than for us , 
  i think it 's fine and normal as long as it 's one of your parents and maybe grand-parents , more than that and it just sounds silly , especially when the person has no idea of what life/the language/the culture is like in the other country they claim to be a part of . 
  mine , but i would n't give them any power . 
  i like it , the uniforms look good . 
  i never watch it but i 've played the ncaa game on ps3 . 
  the problem with watching it as others have said is that it stops every minute and it 's way too long .
