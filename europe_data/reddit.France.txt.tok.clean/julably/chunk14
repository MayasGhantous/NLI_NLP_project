  it is , but it 's too hard to say . 
  it 's too long and does n't `` sound '' good . 
  yes , `` megabyte '' sounds porno in french . 
  ( mega-dick ), 
  when it 's used as a verb yes , but i 've never seen `` arrosage '' used like this . 
  like a policeman could say `` je l'ai arros\u00e9 pour des infos '' ( i bribed him for infos ) . 
  you are correct , 
  yeah they are way better at it than us , but they kind of have to . 
  yes , the government even has a [ page ] ( http://www.gouvernement.fr/top-10-des-mots-d-internet-que-vous-allez-oser-dire-en-francais ) about it some of them mail = courriel bug = bogue hashtag = mot-di\u00e8se those are pretty ok and i could see myself using them if everybody else did too . 
  but then there 's some others like pop-up = fen\u00eatre intruse smiley = frimousse spam = arrosage no french person would want to use these ridiculous words . 
  never heard of any social movements in france sorry, 
  fuck - germany mary - italy invade - england, 
  ah you 're a scot , that changes everything . 
  i take back my blessing , 
  you have my blessing . 
  do i look vaticanese ? 
  seeing it like that in an english sentence makes it sound like we are just very surprised and excited to see a table . 
  ok , thanks , 
  yes , this is exactly why i asked the germans about berlin ( never been there ) , i was thinking maybe berlin was the exception to the rule , but apparently not , 
  thanks . 
  do germans generally like how the middle of the city was rebuilt ( sorry i do n't know the name , i 'm talking about what was the no man 's land area ) ? 
  [ removed where i live ] . 
  the bull thing we call `` corrida '' of course , `` feria '' is more of drinking and music and such . 
  there 's feria in a lot of places in france ( a lot of the south , and in the west too ) . 
  corrida is less prevalent . 
  yep . 
  in my city in the south they take it very seriously ( they still kill the bulls , it takes place in a real roman arena , there 's posters of torero everywhere etc ) . 
  what do germans/you think of berlin ( in term of pretty/ugly ) ? 
  yeah , a basket in the middle of the table is how we do it . 
  i have never seen individual bread plates except in some restaurants , interesting , 
  do you mean one big bread plate , or a bread plate for each guest ? 
  corrida and feria . 
  exactly the same for us too , except maybe for the breadcrumbs , i do n't think people care . 
  what do you do with the breadcrumbs ? 
  lol do n't feel bad  honestly i 've heard people say le havre is ugly a lot of times in my life . 
  but as i said i ca n't know for sure . 
  probably some parts were rebuilt well and others not , i ca n't say . 
  `` can we make [ cordons bleus ] ( http://www.egaliteetreconciliation.fr/local/cache-vignettes/l650xh487/cordon_bleu_macron-c6395.jpg ) instead ? '', 
  i think le havre is/was considered the ugliest . 
  it was bombed heavily by the british during the war and they rebuilt using a lot of concrete . 
  i 've never been , it 's just from what i 've heard . 
  paris `` the city of light '' is seen as the prettiest . 
  honestly , french people do n't think about asians . 
  that conversation does n't surprise me . 
  it 's not really racism though , it 's just a lack of knowledge about asian countries , and being lazy/not caring and just calling every asian chinese ( that person is being an ass though ) . 
  there 's no hate towards asians from french people from what i can tell . 
  i 've had to correct people ( because i 'm annoying ) and be like `` how do you know it was chinese people , they could be koreans or japanese '' and generally just get `` oh . 
  yeah '' as an answer lol . 
  but i think if you tell french people in real life `` my mother was from the philippines '' most of them would try to remember and not call you chinese . 
  mostly from latin america and canada . 
  the us have oil . 
  i think it is yes . 
  well it 's the behind the scenes of his campaign , i did n't expect him to be a mad man but it could be just me lol . 
  the journalist who made it said he had total freedom and all that stuff so it 's not like he got paid to do it . 
  maybe he 's just smarter than what we 're used to . 
  what 's so weird about offering to make coffee ? 
  it was in his house . 
  but anyway no matter one 's opinion of him is , it 's still an interesting doc to see . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  our motto has nothing to do with the colors of the flag . 
  i do n't think it 's generic because it only has two stripes , pretty rare . 
  i like your flag a lot . 
  i voted for him twice so i like him . 
  of course it 's too soon to tell what 's gon na happen . 
  i 'm hopeful but we 'll see . 
  for anyone interested there 's a doc about him on netflix called emmanuel macron : behind the rise, 
  i did n't mean that we only watch american things . 
  but it 's still part of what we do watch . 
  same here . 
  you instantly know the parents are n't the brightest . 
  no , we grow up watching american media ( movies and tv ) , so we de facto know more than you do about europe , because you do n't grow up watching european stuff . 
  it does n't mean that what we know is 100 % accurate but we still have more general knowledge about the us than you do about europe . 
  your question is a prime example . 
  it 's almost as bad as asking us if we have electricity . 
   being ask `` being asked '' . 
  and you are wrong . 
  hard not to be snarky with that one , but i 'm just gon na say : of course . 
  kevin is also bad in france , being `` un kevin '' is even an insult . 
  never been to vienna but i like paris more than rome . 
  but it 's a very subjective thing , depends what you 're looking for really . 
  it 's l'emmental , 
  how much time do you have ? 
  you could have at least looked at the front page , there 's a thread about european bands ... https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6c64y1/what_are_your_favorite_bandssongs_from_your/, 
  it could have easily been the opposite , you just found a nice spanish and a rude french - alright maybe there 's more rude french people than spanish ones but still . 
  as a counter example , my dad , who speaks zero english , told me he helped some lost americans find their way in town a few months ago . 
  so #notallfrench :p, 
  tourists , what a bunch of apples !, 
  more exchange between schools , or little trips . 
  i went to the netherlands and spain as a kid with school and it was a great taste of what europe is . 
  i think it should be done everywhere . 
  it 's important to get out of your own country and see your neighbours , especially as a kid . 
  it 's just not considered very polite . 
  i personally do n't mind since i can understand english , but a lot of the french population struggles in english so straight up walking to a french person and speaking in english , it does n't make people want to make an effort and try to speak back in english and try to understand . 
  if you just go '' do you speak english '' to a french person , without saying anything else before , you 'll get a lot of no 's . 
  if you can say hello can you help me in french and then switch to english , at least the french person can see that you made an effort and maybe is more willing to try and make an effort too . 
  same, 
   barbara - g\u00f6ttingen actually french , but its about french-german reconcilation after the ww2 , never fails to make me cry . 
  oh my god it made me teary . 
  i knew the song but not with that video and not with the parts in german . 
  this is what it 's all about .
