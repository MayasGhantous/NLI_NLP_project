  brodka and hey are very cool , thanks !, 
  is there a word for money that mean `` corn '' in portuguese ? 
  italy , romania and france all have `` corn '' but with different words lol . 
  oh ok , baby steps but at least it seems to be moving in the right direction . 
  how 's the situation there with the syrian war ? 
  we are comparing it to the other arab countries not to our owns , it 's one of the most open ones . 
  yeah they are part of the francophonie , a lot of lebanese speak french , they speak it more than english . 
  mika for example ( the singer ) is from lebanon and he 's now a jury on the voice here , there 's a few famous lebanese people so there 's still a link . 
  well damn . 
  i 'm kind of mad for not even knowing about this , guess our news people do n't deem it important enough . 
  it 's still my pick though . 
  no conchita wurst ? 
  reported !, 
  i do n't think it is ? 
  i think they have some problems with the refugees but nothing too bad ? 
  i could be wrong . 
  it 's not illegal in lebanon, 
  the mali is self defense , we 're fighting terrorists ... 
  they ca n't sit with us , only the last 2 days match . 
  what did you think it would be used for ? 
  it 's not gon na be only parades ... 
  waiting for a romanian to check in, 
  i legit do n't understand what point you want to make there . 
  also just because the uk is leaving the eu does n't mean they are n't ever gon na help with anything . 
  i was watching a french program about trump yesterday , and someone said it was the same with reagan , but the difference was that reagan knew that he did n't know enough . 
  his staff made him a lot of notes that he had to read in public so it looked weird but at least he was n't saying some stupid stuff . 
  well if we get an eu army , it would mean the countries would have been ok with being in an eu army and so yes soldiers from all the european countries would have to contribute , that 's kind of the point . 
  also the uk is still in the eu , and germany is helping too . 
  ( and maybe more i 'm not knowledgable enough to know ) . 
  they also told officials to be quick in their speeches because he has a short attention span and ca n't remember much . 
  but to answer your question i do n't think it would be smart to piss him off too much . 
  but merkel for example had to explain to him how he ca n't just make a deal with germany , he has to make a deal with the eu at large and he did n't seem to get it . 
  he just does n't read his notes apparently . 
  other european countries already support france in mali . 
  domingo from latin dominicus - dominus ( `` lord '' , `` master '' ) https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/domingo s\u00e1bado from latin or ecclesiastical latin sabbatum , from ancient greek \u03c3\u03ac\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ( s\u00e1bbaton , `` sabbath '' ) , from hebrew \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea ( shab\u00e1t , `` sabbath '' ) . 
  that is very strange to me . 
  the ones in french come from the generations before they are very old words not trendy slang . 
  is swedish not very metaphorical ? 
  s\u00e1bado is day of the sabbath and domingo day of the lord , like in italian , portuguese and french , 
  haha i kind of like it . 
  lundi : day of the moon mardi : day of mars mercredi : day of mercury jeudi : day of jupiter vendredi : day of venus samedi : day of the sabbath dimanche : day of the lord but they do n't really `` mean '' that in french , it all comes from latin . 
  haha that 's the spirit, 
  ah yeah i did n't want to assume that it was ok for women to wear kilts but i 'm glad to hear it . 
  is there a similar thing that women wear that look as badass ? 
  it 's funny yours are pretty grim , gravel mice coal ash . 
  the french ones are more food related . 
  there 's more but here 's some of them : ** bl\u00e9 ** - corn ** patates ** - potatoes ** briques ** - bricks ** fric ** - etymology says it would mean `` feast '' in english ** pognon ** - from pogner to punch ** oseille ** - sorrel ( it 's a plant ) ** liquide ** - liquid ** sou ** - from latin solidus meaning solid ** esp\u00e8ces ** - from late latin speci\u0113s meaning spice ** p\u00e9p\u00e8tes ** - from p\u00e9pite meaning nugget of gold ** thune ** - unclear possibly a form of `` tunis '' the city . 
  at least we are peasants with good teeth :p, 
  peasants all of them source : i 'm from paris . 
  112 is the number to call in europe if you need the police/ambulance/firemen . 
  then use what we call passport , 
  i 'm a madame but you 're welcome . 
  there 's an offline mode with google maps . 
  ( you can download an area ) i 'm not sure how well it works i 've never used it but you could look into it . 
  this way you can just download it while at the hotel and use it during the day . 
  if you 're not driving it should be good enough . 
  do n't know mate ( :p ) but you could just use the wifi . 
  if you stay in hotels it 's available in all these countries . 
  do you really need a data plan ? 
  who are you going to call and text in europe ? 
  you could just use skype/whatsapp with the wifi to contact your family in australia . 
  yeah i was pretty sure you were  i just wanted to make sure other people had the correct info . 
  do n't know if you 're joking or not but just to be clear , brittany was inspired by the us flag , not the other way around . 
  what does that mean ? 
  haha , but it 's ok because i 'm interested and i chose to be here . 
  when small talk jumps at you you have no choice but to pretend to be interested and listen :(, 
  no because i subscribe to subreddits with subjects that interest me . 
  i know some of them but for the most part is just hello and a smile when i see them . 
  it 's just a different culture so you can keep your `` just saying '' for yourself . 
  small talk for americans is n't just a few words though . 
  it can go on and on . 
  i know more about my uber drivers that i do about my neighbours . 
  it 's just a waste of time and boring as hell . 
  i would have no problem talking to a stranger about deep interesting things or politics , but small talk is just pointless shit i have no interest in . 
  3rd evolution confirmed, 
  i 've never had an american hot dog from the streets but it always looked like just ketchup mustard and saucisse to me ( from movies ) . 
  it 's just that your sausage is better that 's why i put it above in the evolution :p, 
  ah i was thinking about food for lunch and dinner not cr\u00eapes or waffle stands but yes it 's very good . 
  we also have marrons grill\u00e9s ( roast chestnuts ) in the winter . 
  i see . 
  so it 's more like a pokemon evolution of a hot dog . 
  it looks like it would be good . 
   bratwurst i just looked at bratwurst and it looks good . 
  is it basically sauerkraut in bread ? 
  i can only think of kebab and jambon beurre ( ham and butter in a baguette ) . 
  we 're not a very street foodesque country . 
  i got told to leave while in front of a restaurant reading the menu while smoking in the us . 
  ( no one was seated outside ) it was very shocking to me . 
  suffice to say i did n't go to that restaurant . 
  they make you feel like a true criminal there . 
  a lot of these are true . 
  from my country mustard . 
  [ kinder surprise ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/kinder_surprise_egg.jpg ), 
  for recent books english : the library at mount char french : la horde du contrevent, 
  i just like it , 
  i grew up using azerty . 
  about 10 years ago i went on a trip to the us and decided to buy a new laptop there ( the euro/dollars difference was very nice in these days ) and so for about 5-6 years i used a qwerty , it was a pain in the beginning but i got used to it ( i just looked dumb typing in french without the accents ) . 
  i 'm now back to using a azerty keyboard , weirdly , it did n't take me any time at all to feel comfortable again using it . 
  i guess it 's like riding a bike . 
  she got famous as a teen on the disney channel .
