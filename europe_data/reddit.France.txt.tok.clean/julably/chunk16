  she 's a singer now . 
  same here , it was called `` t\u00eate de n\u00e8gre '' ( nigger 's head ) and is now called `` merveilleux '' ( wonderful ) . 
  conflicting informations . 
  need more finns . 
  according to newspapers they gave money to isis to keep being able to work in syria . 
  they also proposed to help in building trump 's wall . 
  fuck these guys . 
  i would n't put ketchup on gratin . 
  i think it would change the taste of it too much . 
  i 'm not joking . 
  for example , i like to eat a patty with an egg , with ketchup on the side that i use for both the egg and the meat ( with bread ) . 
  same for white rice , if the thing i 'm eating with the rice is bland then i put ketchup on the rice . 
  same for pizza , it 's already tasty and with tomato sauce . 
  i mostly use ketchup for `` bland '' food to give it a little something . 
  with cordon bleu , sometimes pasta ( but not spaghetti ) , patties , white rice . 
  very common . 
  there has been jewish people in france since the 1st century , they came to gaul after it was conquered by rome . 
  it 's hard to answer this question , just think about the american slang you use , there 's hundreds of things . 
  you should try to find a podcast or a youtube channel with french people speaking so you can hear them speak . 
  or if you have specific questions/context in mind then post it and we can help . 
  but you 'll be fine with `` book french '' , i 'm sure you 'll pick up slang quickly . 
  paris - i love everything about it , downside is how expensive it is . 
  barcelona - i love the architecture , the climate , the little beach . 
  only downside is that i do n't speak spanish . 
  berlin - i 've never been but it seems like a nice lively city . 
  if your id is smaller just carry your id . 
  i never take my passport anywhere when i 'm in france . 
  or get a small `` man purse '' with zip pockets and put it there . 
  interesting ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  sure , let 's go for it . 
  i 'm an agnostic , i feel like there might be like a 3 % chance of some kind of `` god '' existing but consider it unlikely . 
  however i stiff feel some kind of closeness with the catholic church ( i went to catholic schools ) and still like the decorum of it all . 
  you do n't even know if you 'll like living in germany . 
  maybe you 'll miss home , your family or just the us . 
  you ca n't know how you 'll feel about it . 
  these crazy plans dont make you look very mature and ready tbh . 
  finding an eu wife ? 
  what ?!, 
  if after like 9 months in germany you still want to stay , find out the legal process and follow it . 
  he probably does n't even know about the existence of estonia anyway . 
  better to try to stay friendly and just wait for the 4 years to be over . 
  yeah but it 's not something you heard them talk about before the irak thing . 
  they got upset and so tried to find anything they could to make us look weak etc. 
  if you lose it or it gets stolen it 's 25 $ . 
  well not really but it does n't mean pretty either . 
  i think diane kruger did a lot in changing people 's minds about it :p it 's not a stereotype you hear much these days . 
  only dumb pepe-meme-making americans would call us that . 
  that 's why it does n't even bother me anymore . 
  i 've heard it . 
  it is said that german women are very `` broad '' . 
  i think it appeared after the irak debacle ( when we said no ) . 
  americans got real mad , 
  also no french politician in their right mind would say `` i 'm a liberal '' that 's not a word with a `` nice '' connotation here . 
  86 euro , it lasts 10 years . 
  til . 
  oh i know . 
  i just wish they had made some research . 
  at least the british taunts make sense . 
  true : lots of strikes false : surrender monkeys . 
  i never understood why we turned into monkeys ? 
  we 're supposed to be frogs . 
  i know , i had to google it to find out , that 's why it 's the best looking one !, 
  i 'm glad it apparently does n't work that well with iphones or i would have to get one too :p, 
  that 's the best looking smartwatch i have ever seen, 
  yes , my problem is with calling a real historical person `` mythological '' . 
  if you call her idealised then i agree with everything you have said , 
  i 'm just saying jeanne was a living breathing person , with historical texts backing it up . 
  it might have been embellished but everything is based on facts and her companions were real . 
  arthur is mostly a creation , yeah some historians might think he was real but he 's not seen as a real historical person so i do n't think jeanne is a good answer for this particular thread . 
  she 's 100 % not mythological . 
  `` jan '' would have been better, 
  jeanne d'arc is real though . 
  all the charles perrault tales are grim in their original versions ( and he did it before the grimm brothers , they all re-invented old folk tales ) bluebeard - little riding hood , sleeping beauty , cinderella , puss in boots etc they were meant to be scary so the kids would behave . 
  in france we have father whipper for the naughty ones ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  yeah i got it after a while but thank you  still does n't make much sense to ask us if we would be depressed during the summer and spring though . 
  why would we get depressed about what are for us the longest days of the year . 
  both are correct apparently but yeah, 
  not busy enough, 
  actual places i do n't know but the legendary broc\u00e9liande forest in brittany is part of it . 
  / r/italy ? 
  maybe in theory but not in popularity , i doubt a lot of french know these stories or what his paladins were named ( i sure do n't  ) . 
  haha same , i do n't even know that singer but it 's pretty catchy . 
  i did n't notice anything weird with the way he sings either . 
  well now i feel bad, 
  [ yes ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/97/90/75/979075968ec4284d07a26952d822bdad.jpg ) [ i ] ( http://i.f1g.fr/media/ext/1900x1900/madame.lefigaro.fr/sites/default/files/img/2015/06/jacques-chirac-president-de-la-hype_1.png ) [ totally ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/5a/d0/fa/5ad0fac38902e4e3b4b9cba1102a782c.jpg ) [ agree ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/124d3967f43334739ae385e47d13aa2f/tumblr_n5ew9outmp1r7k22ko1_500.jpg ), 
  why the wild men ? 
  very cool !, 
  i think it was because he also asked me if i was `` female '' . 
  but anyway , 
  this is our unofficial [ coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/armoiries_r%c3%a9publique_fran%c3%a7aise.svg?uselang=fr ) . 
  unofficial because it 's not in the constitution but it 's on our passports and various other things . 
  i liked this one from the [ iiird republic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/francecoatofarms1898-2.png?uselang=fr ) . 
  some other ones i like : [ 1211 - 1376 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/arms_of_the_kingdom_of_france_%28ancien%29.svg?uselang=fr ) [ 1578 - 1792 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/coat_of_arms_of_kingdom_of_france.svg?uselang=fr ) [ napol\u00e9on ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/imperial_coat_of_arms_of_france_%281804-1815%29.svg?uselang=fr ) [ restauration ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/coat_of_arms_of_the_bourbon_restoration_%281815-30%29.svg?uselang=fr ) and the one the vichy regime used : [ 1940 - 1944 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/le_cartouche_de_l%27%c3%89tat_fran%c3%a7ais.svg?uselang=fr ), 
  aaw do you feel left out ? 
  i think carlos ii wins in the ugly department but [ henri iv ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/heinrich_iv_von_frankreich%281553-1610%29.jpg ) is n't bad either . 
  do you also close your eyes when you see greco-roman statues of naked men because no-homo ? 
  if you find 99 % of your pms ugly it means you can also find some cute . 
  i 'm not sure i understand correctly . 
  the days are n't short in spring and summer , they are short during the winter . 
  to answer , [ winter depression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seasonal_affective_disorder ) is a thing .
