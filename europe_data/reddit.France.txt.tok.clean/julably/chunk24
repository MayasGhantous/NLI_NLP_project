  kitchen, 
  i do n't know what 's worse , the sushi burritos , or the [ kit kat pizza ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h3behsi.jpg ) from japan, 
  what you call bread , and croissants in the us . 
  i would n't give to eat to my worse enemy . 
  peanut butter is an american thing i could get but do n't like . 
  i 'm just too used to nutella i guess . 
  most french games do n't take place in france . 
  heavy rain , beyond two souls , the nomad soul , rayman , dishonored ... my personal favorite is prehistorik man for the super nintendo , that game was awesome , i do n't think it 's very famous though . 
  yes another adventure one that 's really good is life is strange . 
  a very unique feel with a great story ( it 's french ) . 
  i do n't . 
  i 'm not even baptised . 
  my father is n't either and neither were his parents so i would n't say everyone has one , 
  american english kinda sounds like they have a hot potato in their mouths . 
  the witcher 3 is great and european ( from poland ), 
  yeah i 've also heard that about tours but i have no idea what they sound like . 
  paris is still the `` standard '' french i think . 
  the fuck, 
   i do not like the part when everyone you meet greets you with '' \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` christ is risen !, 
  '' ) , and you are supposed to answer with '' \u0412\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` indeed risen ! '' ) . 
  the things you learn in this sub !, 
  that sounds pretty funny to me but i can understand how annoying it might be after a lifetime of hearing this, 
  no sadly nothing fancy in the french passport, 
  i honestly doubt it . 
  a lot of americans seem to genuinely think they live in the best and free-est ( ??? 
  not sure how to say that ) country in the world . 
  why would we want more americans i do n't understand the reasoning . 
  there 's a lot of zealots ( as you said ) in the usa too . 
  very problematic . 
  what about american-muslims for example ? 
  being muslim is not a nationality , anybody can be a muslim and discrimination against a religion is something europe does n't want to do again . 
  and i doubt there 's a lot of americans that would want to move to europe . 
  how do you increase it ? 
  we ca n't force americans to immigrate here ( not that we would want to , it 's fine if americans want to come live in europe but it 's not something we `` need '' ) . 
  people living in poor countries or where there is wars are gon na leave no matter what so i do n't know . 
  looks like the only way to decrease immigration is taking care of the source of the problem . 
  easier said than done . 
  also it is not europe 's job to educate americans on social democracy and make them more open minded , we are n't a summer camp , 
  yes . 
  if they 've been in france more than 3 months they get healthcare . 
  if they 've been in france less than 3 months , they only get healthcare for serious life threatening things , pregnancy , and kids . 
  yeah but it 's still disappointing to see that kind of behavior being rewarded . 
  i was n't implying anything , not everything is about the fucking nazis . 
  they 're just more blonde there than in the rest of france , that 's the stereotype anyway . 
  [ patrick balkany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrick_balkany ) member of the national assembly of france since 1988 . 
  has multiples investigation procedures and scandals since 2000 . 
  some of them : tax avoidance ( multiple times ) bygmalion case ( shady stuff concerning sarkozy 's campaign ) corruption ( multiple times ) panama papers lying about his assets/property catcalling a minister at the assembly because she was wearing a flower dress . 
  always re-elected .

  we 're still waiting for the story do n't let us hanging , 
  only two, 
  lol yeah !, 
  well it might just be me or tarot got a resurgence in the last 10 years . 
  i know of belote but never heard of contr\u00e9e , it 's the first time i even see that word . 
  i played cards in summer camps and school and i ca n't remember anyone ever mentioning tarot as a game . 
  i grew up in paris maybe it 's more of a provence thing ? 
  that 's strange , i 've never heard of `` contr\u00e9e '' either haha, 
  do you mean as a game or used by `` mediums '' ? 
  i 've personally never seen anyone playing tarot . 
  i like italian and russian . 
  for non-european i find japanese very pleasing to hear . 
  there 's a lot of languages i 'm not familiar with though :(, 
  he 's always been a man . 
  his stage persona is a drag queen . 
  i find this one is bland in comparison, 
  i was joking buddy . 
  it 's not your thing i get it . 
  wrong !, 
  it gave us beautiful flower queen conchita wurst . 
  also c\u00e9line dion, 
  oh putain !, 
  apologies . 
  you 're right , the lyrics were very dramatic ( war ) but the melody/chorus was catchier . 
  wine . 
  bordeaux , muscat , ros\u00e9 ... 
  wine . 
  bordeaux , muscat , ros\u00e9 ... 
  unless our presidential election goes badly ... but yeah . 
  aww too bad , i loved loreen . 
  i can see why people did n't vote for her though , the song is too dark for eurovision i think . 
  did loreen try to enter again ? 
  very meh [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koi36aerv7i ) but i 'm used to it . 
  i usually like the nordics and russia . 
  as long as we beat you i 'm happy , 
  what a nice tradition !, 
  no i never did . 
  although when i moved in i got invited to go and meet the mayor in his office ( !? ), 
  but it 's a communist ( literally from the communist party ) elected mayor so maybe that explains it ? 
  it was very strange to me . 
  i know my parents contacted a minister ( i think it was sarkozy ) for a problem they had once , they wrote a letter and that fixed the problem . 
  but it 's not very common to do that i think . 
  yes , but the question was about `` fat shaming '' . 
  the harassment is in the word itself . 
  having a normal conversation or talking prevention is helpful , but shaming them is not ( imo ) . 
  the only reason why i added that bit is because / u/ampersand55 is from sweden and i feared he/she would bring up the ( very cool ) [ r\u00f6k runestone ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/r%c3%b6kstenen.jpg ) . 
  you 're never too careful on the internet :d,
