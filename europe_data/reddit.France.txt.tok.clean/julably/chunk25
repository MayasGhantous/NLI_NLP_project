  i knew that comment would be coming . 
  it can also be genetic though , of course they could do something about it but i do n't think it 's helpful to harass them about it that 's all . 
  my opinion is the same than for people making fun of other people for being short or stuttering . 
  it 's just not very nice . 
  i 'm guessing fat people know they are fat and do n't really need us to remind them every 2 seconds . 
  indeed , 
  * high five *, 
  haha and he 's probably now gon na cancel the trip thinking we 're all assholes . 
  travel questions are fine when the person has put more than 2 mins into the trip but expecting us to do all the work is not a nice way to go about it, 
  reporting a mod , nice move . 
  frankly i think you guys should delete the posts when it 's that vague , it 's really annoying . 
  maybe you should add a rule saying people have to put some thoughts into their travel questions before posting . 
  why not ? 
  i was n't being sarcastic . 
  myths and legends are n't set in stone ( well some are ) . 
  there 's many versions of fairy tales and myths and re-imagining the classics is a genre in literature . 
  someone needs to write a retelling with europa being badass and killing all the gods or something . 
  better , we should make a movie about it and in 10 years call it `` european folklore '' :p, 
  yes !, 
  mte but then i realised it 's prehistoric art so that 's actually great but yeah still kind of creepy . 
  the cents from ** portugal ** are awesome , i love the super old vintage design . 
  ** malta ** is cool too with the maltese cross . 
  and of course ** greece ** and europa with the bull/zeus . 
  the same way i 'd feel about a 4th time removed cousin . 
  i know it 's there but i do n't feel much closeness . 
  i 've been to louisiana and it was nice seeing french text in the churches or street names , that kind of thing but that 's about it . 
  not much from what i remember . 
  i know we did the slave trade , and of course we talk about you when studying wwii . 
  there 's so much to cover just with french history , we do n't have enough time to go deep into other countries ' history . 
  but everybody knows the gist of it . 
  not very . 
  the only place i feel close to is qu\u00e9bec . 
  americanocentrism ... 
  you could at least have explained what it is ... 
  i googled it and it 's a golf tournament . 
  i obviously did n't know what it was . 
  i try to buy stuff from france or from europe when i can . 
  like subscribing to spotify instead of tidal/apple music for example . 
  of course for a lot of things it 's not possible ( like tvs , consoles ) . 
  yes i also had trouble with the first 2 ethic questions , still did my best to answer them . 
  thanks for creating that survey . 
  it 's perfectly fine and understandable . 
  i just wanted to point out how it is viewed in france because / u/criticalspirit was kind of implying that i was twisting things to appear more `` open '' or something to that effect when in reality the history between france and north africa is such that when we ( french ) speak of the mediterranean sea and relationship between the countries , we actually mostly mean `` better partnership with algeria/morroco '' . 
  but this is of course from a french perspective . 
  yes context is everything , but since there is no context in the question , it has to be yes . 
  in france when we talk about the `` mediterranean countries '' we definitively mean algeria and morocco too and not just italy/spain/portugal . 
  of course . 
  europe does n't own the mediterranean sea . 
  when is it ? 
  i only know about the roma pilgrimage to saintes maries de la mer ( south of france ) , it lasts a week , it 's in may i think . 
  there is a way to say it in french tho , people could say `` it 's logical '' -  c\u2019est logique or `` it is with sense '' -  `` c\u2019est sens\u00e9 '' . 
  the it-makes-sense-tisis disease needs to stop :(, 
  nothing, 
  same here , my grandmother wore one to go outside . 
  she was n't religious at all so i 'm pretty sure it was just because it used to be trendy as you said . 
  yeah exactly !, 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by folklore . 
  to europeans it would just be american history i guess . 
  to me folklore implies something like myths or old traditions but the us is so new nothing is a myth , pretty much everything is recorded history no ? 
  but anyway we probably all know of things like bonnie and clyde , pocahontas etc, 
  the problem is not the word `` sens '' , it 's a french word we use , the problem is with `` make '' and `` fait '' and just the word-for-word translation of it ( almost like a google translate type of thing ) . 
  i know , me too . 
  let 's keep fighting the good fight !, 
  that 's crazy !, 
  does it also sounds off to you in german ? 
  not really in every day life but there 's more and more ads on tv with english slogans , it 's ridiculous ( even from french companies ) . 
  there 's also a few weird things happening like french people starting to say `` \u00e7a fait sens '' which is a literal translation of `` it makes sense '' . 
  i started hearing it like 2-3 years ago . 
  it does n't sound good in french i do n't know why people are doing it . 
  i find it really annoying . 
  what ? 
  your question sounds like you live in a post apocalyptic world where there 's only a few humans left , are you a time traveller ? 
  what would be the point ? 
  it wo n't change anything . 
  you should have `` confronted '' people before the vote , now it 's pointless . 
  never heard of it, 
  i do meditate sometimes and i find it helpful i do n't know how scientific it is but it seems to work for me . 
  however , i 'm against all the places/apps that make you pay for it , you do n't need anything to do it , and i feel like all these people are just scammers . 
  i do n't really know how popular it is it 's not really something people talk about . 
  yorkie and kelly otp, 
  omg i loved that song too haha here 's the [ french version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xotiykmsrzw ), 
  i do n't really notice any difference . 
  one episode really stuck with me ( even tho it 's been like 20 years ) , they had to cross an highway at some point ( because of deforestation ) all these little cute animals tried to cross it one by one , some bigger animals had smaller ones on their backs , and some of them sadly did n't make it , it was brutal lol, 
  we had a ton of animes in france in the 90s it would take too long to list them ( i loved ranma 1/2 ! ), 
  but also european cartoons and some american ones . 
  but to give one answer , i 'm gon na link to an european one [ the animals of farthing wood ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzc7ystx898 ) co-produced by germany , france , spain and the uk . 
  do any of you from these countries know it ? 
  i really like [ lady godiva ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/lady_godiva_%28john_collier%2c_c._1897%29.jpg ) , [ saint eulalia ] ( http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/n/n01/n01542_10.jpg ) and [ the martyr of the solway ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/john_everett_millais_-_the_martyr_of_the_solway_%28walker_art_gallery%2c_liverpool%2c_c._1871._%c3%93leo_sobre_lienzo%2c_70.5_x_56.5_cm%29.jpg ) are the pre-raphaelites famous in england ? 
  the karl xii : s likf\u00e4rd painting is beautiful . 
  and john bauer is awesome ( it 's the only one i knew ) . 
  i did n't know saint-r\u00e9my-de-provence was in the netherlands  jk, 
  if painters ' nationalities do n't matter then it 's the mona lisa . 
  if we 're talking french painters then probably [ la libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple - delacroix ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/eug%c3%a8ne_delacroix_-_le_28_juillet._la_libert%c3%a9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg ) . 
  i like [ napol\u00e9on crossing the alps - david ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/david_-_napoleon_crossing_the_alps_-_malmaison2.jpg ) edit : another favorite , all the drawings from the [ grotte de chauvet - unknown ] ( http://s2.lemde.fr/image/2014/06/22/534x0/4443127_7_5f1f_ill-4443127-776b-chevaux-chauvet_8aed469909aed7c403fe5f4b5a8a9e71.jpg ) dating back 37,000 to 33,500 years ago . 
  until next time , 
  technically a cathedral is a church, 
  lol or the palazzo apostolico , i really dropped the ball there .
