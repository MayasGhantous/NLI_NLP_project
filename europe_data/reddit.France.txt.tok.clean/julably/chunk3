  you can look on the [ fnac ] ( http://bilheteira.fnac.pt/pesquisa/page/1?district=42&amp;subcategories=&amp;category=&amp;venue=&amp;pricefrom=&amp;priceto=&amp;datefrom=&amp;dateto=&amp;search=&amp;utm_source=mmbilheteira ) site . 
  just pick musica for categoria and classica or concerto for subcategoria and change the dates, 
  he did n't renounce his french citizenship , he 's just a dual citizen now . 
  but anyway he 's seen as being a legendary actor and personality and even if he does weird and crazy stuff i think people still like him overall . 
  we do n't take what he says or does very seriously . 
  he 's kind of part of our identity in a way , like the eiffel tower and baguettes . 
  most of them yes but refrigerated trucks are allowed to drive on sundays . 
  exactly , it 's a nightmare . 
  at least there 's very little trucks on sundays ... 
  i think it 's 2 years if i remember correctly . 
  you have to put a `` a '' sticker ( for apprentice ) at the back of your car . 
  yeah . 
  i know we got ta eat but all these trucks really make me nervous : - /, 
  true ... 
  no i do n't . 
  and i 'm just thinking about op , it 's nicer not to be freezing cold when traveling . 
  how is having `` nobody 's there '' a minus ? 
  sounds pretty nice in my book . 
  why not ? 
  central europe can be depressing visually during winter . 
  highways are good and maintained , the only bad thing about them is all the trucks on it ( from all over europe ) . 
  the speed limit is 130 kmh . 
  110 for new drivers or when there 's bad weather . 
  minimum speed is 80 kmh . 
  you can get a little box that you put inside your car so that you do n't have to stop to pay for it , the automatic lanes are faster too . 
  even if you have homework you usually do n't have homework in every subjects so that still helps with the heavy bag . 
  plus even if you have to carry the books to school at least when you arrive you can put them in the locker and not have to carry them all day . 
  another solution would be to give two sets one that stays at school one that stays home . 
  or the teacher could give homework where you do n't need the textbook . 
  having a locker is still better than not having one in every situation imaginable, 
  as you said not much history because it 's so new so it 's a bit bland and boring to us . 
  i guess new york would be the historical capital for me . 
  we have to bring our books every morning that 's my point . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you can see russia from my house, 
  how dare you !, 
  one country uses two different taps for hot and cold water . 
  that country is known as being perfidious but i 'm not gon na name names . 
  no they are n't :( only boarders had lockers at my school . 
  shout out to the us and their lockers in schools . 
  it still baffles me that we have n't implemented this . 
  brussels . 
  my french heart wants to say strasbourg though but that just would n't be true . 
  it was pretty easy 10 years ago tbh , i did it all the time except when with people that `` do n't want to read '' lol . 
  almost 10 years ago . 
  so you 're saying now all foreign films are showed with subtitles and not dubbed ? 
  i have a hard time believing it . 
  i 'd say no , a majority of french people like dubbed better ( a lot of people do n't even have the option ) . 
  when i was living in paris when seeing a movie dubbed the theatre would usually be full , when with subtitles i 'd say maybe 1/3 to 2/3 full so less popular . 
  yeah , i wish we could see them in just vo too :(, 
  dubbed but in big cities you can chose to see them in vost ( original language with french subtitles ), 
  i also enjoy vintage space and real life lore !, 
  i 'm gon na check your other recommendations for sure !, 
  here 's some that i think people reading this sub might enjoy . 
  [ arika okrent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucsabq0fvcfj2hmokn3f__8q ) she makes video about the etymology of words ( while a guy draws the explanations ) [ crash course ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/playlists ) they have fun and entertaining courses about philosophy , history , mythology , computer science etc. 
  [ lessons from the screenplay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucerssa3cap_gjxmfpdjg9jw ) it 's a guy analysing famous scenes and explaining why it works . 
  [ simone giertz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc3keomznz8eynwbc34rakcq/videos ) a swedish girl that got youtube famous by making shitty robots ( they work but they are useless ) . 
  now she also makes other silly sciency vids . 
  [ lindsay ellis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube/videos ) a girl that explains myths in pop culture like `` is beautify and the beat about stockholm syndrome '' or `` loose canon aphrodite '' where she looks at all the time aphrodite appeared on tv and film and comments on it . 
  [ critikal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucq6vfhwmzcmxbukyg7sqyig ) it 's a guy playing video games but his commentary is just hilarious it 's not your usual dudebro shit . 
  i prefer regular american accent because it 's the one i 'm used to the most and so it 's the one the less noticeable for me and the most immersive . 
  i do n't like when i have to think about or wonder what the characters are saying because it takes me out of the story . 
  but it 's not that big of a deal i usually put the subtitles on anyway . 
  the only thing i hate are french characters with british accents , makes me want to vomit . 
  nothing or slippers , and flip flops in summer, 
  and blue by eiffel 65 !, 
  ah good to know !, 
  i better not hold my breath in the hope of seeing them in france though lol, 
  very important , we find cool stuff all the time . 
  just last week it was announced that they found a `` little pompeii '' in the rh\u00f4ne department . 
  [ a roman site ] ( http://scd.france24.com/fr/files_fr/imagecache/home_1024/article/image/02082017_little_pompeii.jpg ) of 7000 m2 . 
  i do n't know about the schools though sorry . 
  i think you can see aurora borealises in island , finland , sweden and norway so maybe them . 
  pretty much everybody knows d\u00e9jeuner en paix . 
  he 's liked but it 's not like we talk about him a lot . 
  nice accent when singing . 
  we already pay kidnappers/terrorists when they have french citizens . 
  it 's not official and not talked about but everybody knows . 
  the opinion is that it 's fine because if it were you or one of your family member being kidnapped in the desert you would want your government to do anything possible to save you . 
  sure it sets a precedent but i do n't think kidnapping a us citizen is less sought out than kidnapping a french one so in the end it does n't really matter . 
  op brought up the commonwealth , not / u/werkstadt, 
  casse toi une jambe is just `` break a leg '' translated it 's not a true french idiom , only people speaking english would say that . 
  and they would sound silly in my book . 
  that 's exactly what he 's saying ... 
  yes . 
  speaks english = anglosphere . 
  simple as that . 
  thanks for the confirmation that nobody knows that word haha well we learned something , 
  yes i have heard about it too . 
  after the terrorist attacks schools started doing it . 
  understandable but heartbreaking . 
  yeah , is n't barouche used in english ? 
  i had to look up the word because i did n't know what it was called , we call it `` cal\u00e8che '' . 
  i should have said horse carriage :d, 
  merde meaning shit . 
  we often say `` j' te dis merde ! '', 
  `` i tell you shit ! '', 
  because saying `` good luck '' would be jinxing it . 
  it comes from the time when people used barouche to go to the theatre . 
  if a lot of horse shit was in front of the theatre it meant your play was successful .
