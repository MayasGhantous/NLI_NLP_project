  gay people in europe are just like gay people in the us and just like every other person on the planet . 
  next time maybe try to word things with more tact as not to make it sounds like they are a totally different species and so `` other '' . 
  what an offensive way to phrase all of this . 
  you could n't have sounded more ignorant if you had tried . 
  how is that stupid ? 
  november 11 is the day we remember the fallen soldiers ( because of the armistice of 1918 ) . 
  it 's a recent thing , before sarkozy it was just armistice day and now it 's both . 
  and yeah i guess french people like their military as can be seen every 14 juillet , a lot of people watch and enjoy the military parade . 
  they do have some power , they can call referendums , dissolve the general council , chose the diplomatic representatives and also enact laws , use their veto for international treaties , the power to pardon , chose the members of the constitutional tribunal etc they usually do n't meddle much though . 
  in 2009 sarkozy put pressure on andorra so that they 'd take action against tax evasion . 
  he also threatened that he would resign if nothing was done . 
  it worked and after many things done andorra was removed from tax heaven lists . 
  and yeah they do go for ceremonies , the french co-prince usually visits andorra twice during his mandate . 
  ... exactly, 
  did you try it ? 
  what it is like ? 
  the part about the freezing winter is the problem lol and the rain . 
  not very original but i would also pick australia , nz and canada , in that order . 
  canada being last because of the weather . 
  email them and ask, 
  i did n't even know it was a drink . 
  we have aloe vera in soap and shampoo but i do n't know if we have drinks . 
  i also learned how old some of these sayings are !, 
  very cool :d, 
  yeah but look at the dates , the muslim conquest started in 711 so that makes sense . 
  are you from the tax department ? 
  haha no problem , it did say `` in the countryside '' though , so there were probably castles but not as many as in france is what i 'm guessing . 
  i have no idea lol i 'm just telling you what the explanation for that saying is . 
  that 'd be a fun fake-etiquette rule to give to confuse americans lol, 
  a bit of both i think , 
  alright , i looked it up and it 's referring to the fact that there were no castles in the countryside of spain during the muslim conquest of hispania . 
  because of this , the moors could n't retreat easily because there were no castles to hide in . 
  it is . 
  victor hugo made it popular in les mis\u00e9rables . 
  de gaulle only spoke german , he was learning speeches by heart in all the other languages . 
  we are taught not to talk about politics , religion and swimming pools . 
  you would n't want to offend the beach lovers or the anti-chlorine lobbyists . 
  `` win the yes needs the no to win against the no '' - raffarin - living legend . 
  our president speaks english ( a first for us ) and our pm speaks german, 
  yeah i only listed the ones i could think about that are about europe since op asked about neighbours  ps : i do n't think the one about the americans is a real one , i 've never heard it and there 's nothing about it on google from any dictionaries . 
  `` speaking french like a ** spanish ** cow `` - not speaking in a grammatically correct way `` the ** english ** are landing '' - having your periods `` another one the ** boches ** wo n't get '' - after a good meal , referring to the nazis . 
  `` drunk like a ** pole ** '' `` pardon my ** latin ** '' - excuse my french `` building castles in ** spain ** '' - something impossible to do . 
  `` the ** scottish ** shower '' - when something good is going on and all of a sudden it goes bad , or when someone is nice and all of a sudden rude , basically changing behaviours or events . 
  `` seeing ** naples ** and dying '' - meaning it 's the most beautiful city ever `` in ** rome ** do as the romans do '' `` ** rome ** was n't build in a day '' `` all the roads lead to ** rome ** '' `` falling from ** charybde to scylla ** '' - from bad to worse `` go get lost with the ** greeks ** '' `` it 's ** byzance ** '' - it 's splendid `` strong like a ** turk ** '', 
  americans love their ice . 
  to be fair , i 've also seen british people do it . 
  quick way to have all the french turn against you haha . 
  from wikipedia : lebanon is the most religiously diverse country in the middle east . 
  [ 178 ] as of 2014 the cia world factbook estimates the following : muslim 54 % ( 27 % shia islam , 27 % sunni islam ) , christian 40.5 % ( includes 21 % maronite catholic , 8 % greek orthodox , 5 % melkite catholic , 1 % protestant , 5.5 % other christian ) , druze 5.6 % , very small numbers of jews , baha'is , buddhists , hindus and mormons . 
  we like them and have a good image of lebanon in general i 'd say . 
  immigrants from lebanon are usually educated and integrate well . 
  plus we know a lot of lebanese speak french and we like that . 
  lean how to say hello , thank you and `` do you speak english '' in the different languages . 
  do n't assume people do ( well except for the uk and ireland ) do n't do small talks for hours with strangers unless you clearly see they are into it . 
  on escalators stay on the right , the left side is for busy people . 
  try local dishes and even if you do n't like them keep your mouth shut about it . 
  tell locals how beautiful their city/monuments are if you get the chance . 
  be mindful of the fact that locals are living their lives , working etc and might not be ready to drop everything to help you , if you need help try to approach someone that does n't look too busy . 
  in france , do not ask for ice in your wine ( do n't know about the other countries ) and do n't order coke/soda with your meal . 
  do n't bring up the us unless it 's to tell something is better where you are than at home or if asked about it . 
  nobody likes or cares about how xyz is better in your country . 
  even if you do n't do all these things you 'll be fine , they are just nice things to do and think about . 
  enjoy your trip , 
  yes it 's a thing and happens a few times in every sporting event . 
  we call it `` la ola '' and when the wave comes to you , you have to scream '' oohlaaaaa '' . 
  we do n't have a lot of prostestants , i can only tell you that we have a few evangelical churches here and there . 
  i once saw a group of them in the metro in paris singing jesus stuff . 
  it was mostly black people so i 'm guessing it 's like in the us where they like to sing and stuff . 
  they looked very happy and pumped up . 
  their churches look like regular buildings ( not church-like like our catholic churches ) . 
  there was also a mormon girl in school with me , i 'm honestly still not over it , but she was actually very nice and non judgmental . 
  all that other stuff you talked about is so rare that it seems to be non-existant . 
  one gipsy woman put a `` magical rock '' in my mom 's hand without asking anything and then asked for money , then got really mad when i told her we would not give her anything lol, 
  yes and unfortunately everything said about them is true . 
  ( stealing inside your house , putting shit in your hand and forcing you to hear about your future and then asking for money etc ), 
  those people are wrong . 
  i 've always found this and the fact that you can see random trials on tv very weird . 
  those are things that make us go '' haha ... americans ... '', 
  for traffic on tv , they show us a map of france with the important roads and they color them , green if there 's no traffic and red when there 's traffic . 
  during summer they will show the huge traffic on tv but not from an helicopter , journalists just put their camera in a high spot where you can see the highway and that 's it . 
  using an helicopter just seems like a waste of money . 
  that made me feel real good !, 
  canadians and americans sound the same . 
  and kiwi and australians i ca n't tell the difference either . 
  and it took me years to hear the difference between australian/nz and english people . 
  common . 
  at least one big one every summer i 'd say . 
  only scottish , american ( from the south too ) and australian . 
  for the different accents from the u.k. 
  i really ca n't tell or do n't know the difference . 
  we 're house tyrell, 
  i did n't find it overly sweet but it just tastes like something that has gone bad . 
  only aestheticism is stopping us, 
  not sure if serious or trolling, 
  we do n't have it , i tried it in the us and hated it lol, 
  12 points for czech republic, 
  i think it 's pretty common , i still do it sometimes lol . 
  but is n't it more about something bad not happening than wishing for something ? 
  that 's how it is used in my family anyway . 
  i think she used to be seen as manipulative , jealous , ready to do anything to conserve power ( things that are pretty normal for male rulers but were seen negatively for her ) and now the consensus is more about rehabilitating her and seeing how well she used her influence in a very complicated time .
