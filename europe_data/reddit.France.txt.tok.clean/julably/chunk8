  and the ocean is a bit cold ( but fun so it 's ok ) . 
  oh yes we do . 
  there 's off course the big military parade on the champs-elys\u00e9es but also fireworks and bals/parties in most town and city . 
  hahahahaha, 
  `` to have another language is to possess a second soul . '', 
  there 's some where i live but overall i do n't think they are very common in france . 
  the bettencourt family ( l'or\u00e9al ) . 
  liliane bettencourt is the 11th richest person on the planet . 
  really ? 
  ive only ever heard kids mess it up . 
  they are doing it !, 
  i do n't know how other french people do it but we just slice it and eat it with our hands in my family . 
  i 've never met anyone that asked for salt . 
  for regular melon we sometimes eat it with porto in it . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande c\u00e9cile de france, 
  and the best real foreign name shia labeouf meaning `` shat the beef '' or `` shat the food '', 
  sure , but it would have to be used , i 'm not going through learning a language just to have almost no one speak it . 
  after what felt like a lifetime begging my parents , i got lucky ( or they got tired of me asking ) and they agreed to get me one lol so i was the proud owner of a red fubu hoodie . 
  how silly of us , now thinking about it , they really were nothing special haha . 
  nope . 
  probably a nice-but-weird person . 
  haha yeah fubu and the chicago bulls caps were definitively a thing in france in the 90s, 
  it 's more than an origin , it 's a borrowed french word , 
  no , unless he does something tremendous-ly stupid , we do n't hear that much about him . 
  we have our own stuff and politicians to worry/talk about so there 's not really one agreed-upon nickname for him . 
  just `` president of the free world '' ^ / s, 
  i went to ** normandie ** to see all the wwii related stuff when i was in elementary school . 
  we went to the beaches , the infamous sainte-m\u00e8re-\u00e9glise church , the bunkers , museums ... i also went to salamanca in ** spain ** while in elementary school . 
  i 'm not sure why but it was awesome . 
  then when in middle school we went to ** amsterdam ** for a week . 
  one of my classmate of course smoked too much weed and the teacher had to call the ambulance lol . 
  in\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 ( ineligibility ) is very hard to say . 
  i 'm sure there 's some stuff when it comes to pronounciation and ignorance but i ca n't think of anything edit : i 've found one , some people say `` comme m\u00eame '' instead of `` quand m\u00eame '' ( meaning something like `` well . . still '', 
  where are you from ? 
  they look good i do n't think there 's a deeper meaning than that . 
  no i do n't , it never crossed my mind . 
  no not at all . 
  edit : speaking english is seen as `` impressive '', 
  sure but he beat him before . 
  and he 's seen as standing up against a more powerful enemy . 
  i do n't know if you 're joking or not but a lot of our kings were well liked and a few are still popular today . 
  our superheroes are real . 
  vercing\u00e9torix jeanne d'arc louis xiv napol\u00e9on etc, 
  no , only kids playing football and other kids games for fun . 
  there 's buildings on one side so it ca n't really be used for anything fancy . 
  in paris , the wall of philippe august is not well known , it looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/rue_clovis.jpg ) and is from the [ 12th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/franceenglandcard2_052.jpg ) . 
  also the lut\u00e8ce arena , even if not very impressive compared to our other arenas , it 's cool . 
  maybe n\u00eemes or arles if you want to see roman stuff . 
  no , that sounds very weird lol, 
  the enlightenment, 
  i had no idea famke was dutch !, 
  yay, 
  i love it but i do n't know how popular it is . 
  i used to order from an indian restaurant in paris but i 've had no luck in finding one now that i 'm in the south . 
  i 'm sure there 's some somewhere but it 's not common . 
  i have known the francs but i 'm used to the euro by now so i do n't think in francs at all . 
  before the francs we had the `` ancien francs '' and i know when we still had the francs , old people were still using ancien francs all the time so i 'm guessing older people now still use the francs in every day speech but i do n't really know . 
  it does n't bother me when some time has passed between the same questions , but sometimes we get the same question 4 times in like two weeks so it can get a bit annoying . 
  it 's not a big deal i just usually skip them but yeah . 
  in avoiding overpopulation in pets ... 
  quality burn right there, 
  what 's up with your colonies are you still bros ? 
  i feel like a disneyland employee having to answer people asking where the toilets are all day . 
  you have to keep smiling and act like it 's the first time you are answering that question . 
  i tried gravity falls and it did n't grab me . 
  i 'll give rick and morty a try . 
  you can start by typing healthcare in the search box on the right , there 's a lot of threads about it , 
  m\u00e9lanie laurent in inglorious basterds, 
  then maybe i should n't watch rock and morty lol, 
  nope, 
  should i watch it ? 
  the only cartoon i watch is adventure time , and i 'm way behind . 
  i think i would put us with spain/portugal/italy / greece . 
  we fit more with them than with the netherlands and the uk that 's for sure . 
  same, 
  your map is offensive , france and uk should never be grouped together . 
  ^ ( i 'm only half kidding ), 
  the explanation for being responsible was in my post , you just do n't see it that way . 
  it 's not about them calming down , it 's just about trying to be responsible and not bringing a ton of new puppies into the world that wo n't find good homes . 
  it 's common here , the only people that do n't do it are poor people or cheap people that just do n't care . 
  we have a word equaling a kilometre `` une borne '' which means a `` mile marker '' . 
  une borne = 1 km , they appear every kilometre and look like [ this ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/borne_routi%c3%a8re#/media/file:e_50.jpg ) so we say '' 10 bornes '' to mean 10 kilometres , just like in swedish , it 's shorter to say . 
  ( 2 syllables instead of 4 ) it 's not always used though , some people use it some do n't . 
  the college sport teams . 
  it seems nice to have the whole city/town cheer for a team from their high school/college . 
  it 's fun without being too commercial . 
  if you walk into the streets you can see all the `` ac boxes '' all over the place so it 's definitively a common thing . 
  well i live in the south and almost everyone has ac at home ... 
  very common in the south of france . 
  i read mostly sci-fi and fantasy so in these genres i read in english because a lot of it comes from the us . 
  if i 'm reading another genre , like a classic by a german or greek author then i look at both the french translation and the english translation and pick the one that seems the best to me . 
  edit : for the country as a whole no i 'm not representative at all . 
  i do n't know anyone that reads in english . 
  playing it : somewhat popular watching it : not popular except for sometimes the french women 's team making the news and people watching their games . 
  no but i 've been a few times as a kid/teen , my parents knew people there . 
  fair enough  i think women get as annoyed at the stereotypical americans as men do though . 
  why did you specify males ? 
  is it because you think men are generally more hateful online ? 
  if not then i do n't see why being a young european male would make one more left leaning . 
  there 's plenty of educated young french males voting for the right .
