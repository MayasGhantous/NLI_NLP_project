  i think depopulation is a necessity in the upcoming warming world , even if it 's not a good thing for the economy in the short term . 
  and using immigration like germany do to have his population still grow is the perfect recipe for chaos in the next coming decades . 
  the reactions here are quite frightening , and can really give ground to eurosceptics . 
  this is truly sickening . 
  she will not sink, 
  worse !,

  if my wife had as much hair under her armpit as we have haters , i would still find her attractive ... but what 's new ? 
  europeans roturiers are just being jaloux of our supr\u00ea\u00ea\u00eame cheese culture, 
   and women could n't put a foot in a bar . 
  you seemed to generalize that all women in france could n't put a foot in a bar , and i have shown you that was n't the case . 
  of course , it was n't really the same between the countryside and paris or another big town . 
  it was n't probably very well accepted to see a woman in a bar , but they were n't forbidden if they entered because they were a woman , i know as well my cute sour bluelemon , i 've asked a woman who lived it . 
  and that exactly the contrary in this video , they were forbidden to stay because they were women ... and it 's just next paris !, 
   and women could n't put a foot in a bar . 
  of course women could put a foot in a bar !, 
  society was much more evolved that you think [ couple lesbien dans un bar en 1932 !,

  what i wonder is if these students know how brutal was the ussr with their states ? 
  or they are just 18 years old thinking communist is cool , because fuck capitalism . 
  `` we have the best idiots ! '', 
  why ca n't politicians respect the will of their people on immigration ? 
  the eu is acting like a bully forcing the population of his states to obey his will , i 'm shocked by this abuse of power . 
  some safeguards should be implemented for the population of the eu to not let them bypass their power . 
  i do n't agree with the one you 're answering on the crying episode . 
  but she said this `` islam holds a place in our western societies . 
  islam belongs in europe . 
  [ ... ] i am not afraid to say that political islam should be part of the picture . '', 
  with global warming more and more countries are going to be unsafe , particulary in africa and the middle-east . 
  if we want to have our countries safe , we have to protect ourself . 
  that 's selfish , but this is the only solution . 
  i do n't understand why there are n't more protest from the public against the government . 
  if a village do n't want to welcome someone , forcing them is way worse . 
  japan has a strict immigration policy , it 's their choice to make not ours . 
  oh , thanks . 
  because it really exists . 
   in 50 years from now : hundreds of forest fires in the winter . 
  do you have a source on this please ? 
  i 'm interested . 
  just a friendly banter , the netherlands is actually very efficient in preventing floods https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flood_control_in_the_netherlands, 
  very interesting conversation , many will disagree but i thought it could interest the sub . 
  i strongly feel , if we did n't have all the migrants problem , uk would n't have probably left the eu . 
  that 's exactly what i did . 
  for a long time i gave to doctors without borders , but since i 've found out they have a ship that participate in this smuggling operation , i 've stopped and now give to unicef . 
  lacroix is a french christian newspaper , i think that 's why they focus more on christians in turkey . 
  we have a reponsibility , but we were supported by most of the world . 
  we were asked to intervene even , and we were n't the only one , in fact the usa did have a way bigger role . 
  maybe stopping welcoming migrants to substitute your low fertility problem . 
  if you would n't have been this generous with migrants , less would have try to come . 
  the investigation is not over but they 've confirmed quickly it was n't a terror attack and gang related . 
   the mosque attack . 
  if you mean the attack in avignon , it was n't a terrorist attack apparently , probably gang related . 
  it 's more a local/national news than anything else . 
  avignon is a quite poor town , with a lot of 3rd generation immigrants unemployed . 
  still is a very nice town to visit !, 
  pleased to meet you , i am u/justformeandmeonly, 
  we were talking about the romans here , not the persians . 
  the picts already paid for it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadrian's_wall nemo covfefur cum hadrianus !, 
  my bad, 
   well , yeah . 
  that 's pretty obvious . 
  but the guy that made the post that i quoted does n't seem to care about that fact . 
   you see , when people like that talk about `` unlimited immigration '' they 're just using a code word that basically means `` i do n't want any foreigners at all '' . 
  oh the irony !!, 
  where the fuck did i say that ? 
  quote me please , i would very much like to watch the facts on that . 
  but a lot of mafia in france is from foreign origin . 
  also if you have data to backup your claim on french mafia i would be interested . 
  haha nice analysis , but my worst fear is the albanian mafia using the eu as a tool . 
  albanian mafia is already important in france and germany , i do n't want them to have more power . 
  same , i do n't understand why still having more nations is a good thing . 
  is there a limit ? 
  sorry , but really do n't want albania in the eu . 
  problem is i do n't think afghanistan or syria will be totally safe after a long time , if ever . 
  should we accept refugees for decades because their countries are n't safe ? 
  i do n't think so .

  hmmm , i 'm not sure maronites lebanese would have wanted the alawites to join lebanon either . 
  i definitely will!everyone coming back from holidays in portugal is very pleased . 
  hope you will extinguish this fire as soon as possible . 
   not enough silver in the world to trade for tea .

  wait we are 2nd in something other than cheese per capita ?!, 
  hope france is helping as well . 
  portugal is way greener than i would have thought . 
  the vatican fertility rate is 0 . 
  if they do n't have at least a one child policy they are doomed . 
  so what is your solution ? 
  i remind you that refugees camps already exist in north africa . 
  unfortunately they are not really eurodance except galleon . 
  we have [ modjo - lady ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmfxi3r_lya ) [ mad ` house - like a prayer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwp0n4p0yla ),

  i remember that switzerland invaded liechtenstein in 2007 http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13iht-edstamm.4893796.html  most swiss newspapers did n't even bother to report that on march 1 , 170 swiss army troops crossed the border into liechtenstein . 
  not that we see that many invasions here in the alps , but it soon became clear that this was simply an error in orienteering . 
   the incident occurred in bad weather and in the middle of the night , when switzerland is hard to tell apart from its neighbors . 
  `` it was all so dark out there , '' said one of the misdirected recruits . 
  they did the same thing in the netherlands with denk , they won three seats . 
  i do n't think they will win any in france because french parliementary elections are not elected by proportional representation, 
   who wants `` the creation of a community body to oversee the legislative process '' ? 
  who wants to fight `` the libertine positioning of french society in order to return to the traditional family unit '' ?
