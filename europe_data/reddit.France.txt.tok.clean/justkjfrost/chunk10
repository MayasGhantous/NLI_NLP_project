  most of the pop here seems to see only the banker ( ie yet another guy that handle millions & billions personally yet lecture everyone on austerity ) ( rightly or wrongly , i 'm not going to start on that topic ) that wanted to remove prud ` homme courts ( basically abolishing worker rights abuse court ) & remove a bunch of other social rights in his main projects ( like current weekly hour limits or not working sunday when you already worked 6d ) using basically `` helping jerb kreators ! '', 
  as a single justification . 
  it was not very popular . 
  oh and they basically passed the his project ( in a lightened form tho ) without a vote , using legal technicities . 
  beyond that hollande 's fried , the fn nazis will end up likely second but not first , and sarkozy 's the main other candidate but everyone remember his `` travailler plus pour gagner plus '' ( work more for more pay ) where work hours lengthened for a lot of people but not paid at all ; and where he had his hand in a good dozen corruption/fraud/stolen money scandals . 
  i was comparing the cash transfers to taxes because all the wealth in europe tends to concentrate in a few countries at the detriments of all the others . 
  when that happen with people , one of the main tool is forced centrally-mandated redistribution ( aka taxes ) . 
  we ca n't all have a positive trade balance toward the others . 
  and when germany gets all the money that flows in the eu , maybe it 's time to `` tax '' them a bit & redistribute . 
  here it 's called `` fiscal transfers '' . 
  otherwise you get countries that acts like oligarchs toward the others . 
   roosters are n't kept in coops it 's an image , like most jokes . 
  the expression `` propaganda farm '' is a thing . 
   even your insults are limp as fuck . 
  well , explaining the joke do kills it \\* shrugs \\*, 
   is n't the chicken the national animal of france due to their cowardly nature ? 
  https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=russian+proof+rooster it 's a joke on the `` chicken coop '' like troll factories ( so called propaganda farms ) where people all works in `` cage '' - like cubicles in russia to spread propaganda for a misery pay & can easily be spotted by all using the exact same arguments & wordings . 
   i like how you have sourced evidence for your claims . 
  https://imgur.com/a/7irkq da comrade , no russian invasion in ukraine . 
  your link is broken . 
   from a half-dozen fringe ukrainian nationalist groups like white hammer and the trident of stepan bandera . 
  another , the azov group , is openly neo-nazi , using the `` wolf 's hook '' symbol associated with the ss . 
  `` another '' ; you can feel the writer know what he 's writting down and not totally confusing everything / s azov bataillon 's formed around a core of former white hammers ( that were part of rs some time ago but kicked out due to some violence from some members i 'm not going to comment about but the incident was n't racial or nazi as far as i could find out ) . 
  edit : since you fixed your link , ah yes , it 's going back to the old `` let 's blame the chechens '' game i guess . 
  the same one you played when you [ totally_not_razed_grozny_to_the_ground_its_local_separatists_with_local_irbm_missiles they must have found in a supermarket too ] ( http://www.luciankim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/after-war-chechnya.gov-750w-750x410.jpg ), 
  well , of course , it 's like asking for rich people to like paying taxes . 
  of course , there 's a difference between liking something & it being actually needed for society to run well . 
  isis flag , `` takfir '' , azov woflsangel in orange , `` da '' ( russian for yes ) instead of tak ( ukrainian ) , nazi symbole black & white on ua flag , small mistakes everywhere . 
  yup , welcome to the universe of russian produced propaganda where ukraine = litterally isis . 
  seems leggit . 
  what the title implies is that ukraine does not want to do them . 
  what reality is is that they can not hold them there since there kindah is an invading russian army ther that kindah shoot at the ukrainians ( or at best do n't let them pass ) . 
  never understood the thing with eating frogs and such . 
  but oh it seems to export well so ... 
  da da ignore capitalist pig dog junk food . 
  glorious demokratik people 's republic of ~ ~ novo ~ ~ rossya ( dprr ) will give you better food & solve the obesity problem overnight !, 
   this article represents personal opinions of the author . 
  stopfake editors may not share this opinion . 
  kek . 
  hahahaha lol . 
  not going to happen . 
  what if the war stopped , the current refugees came back in syria and the next ones fill half the current camps only ; and you have a ton of money ( in the billion range ) offered on top of it ? 
   switzerland embargoed ? 
  switzerland is the country where the corrupt politicians hide their dirty money for 5 % interests rates , so no they wo n't embargo their own piggy bank . 
   was norway norway is too rich & powerfull & produce their oil , so no they ca n't embargo it either unless they want their cars to stop running overnight . 
  de facto if they embargoed oil norway it 'd be like embargoing russian gaz . 
   the eu never told greece to took its books hello whitewashing , my old friend . 
   and i 'm glad that the greek economy declined the schadenfreude is strong with you . 
   since it was all funny money they were borrowing . 
  on german/wallstreet orders to hide that they had no money when they joined the eu . 
  well in sweden rent will be easily 1000-1500 $ equivalent , utilities ( water , power , heating , etc ) 300-500 , add taxes ( 30 % ? 
  ) , food , home insurance , health insurance , pension insurance , cloths , telecoms , the car ( oil gaz insurance repairs downpayments on loan ) , a 20 % vat on everything and there 's not much left . 
  hell in france , 200e would pay me 3 weeks of food only and nothing else & sweden costs even more . 
  so i hope a sweden barber makes more than a romanian one or otherwise he 'll be homeless in no time . 
   not paying your taxes and overborrow and overspending ( ... ) while the debt piles and a bullshit fake economy is created on was n't an `` economy '' , it s a scam on the back of everyone . 
  yes . 
   to get votes then you find out it 's the german that ordered it , get all the money back , and owns all the debts and goods . 
  the butter , the butter 's money and the farmer 's farm & family debts are all germany 's now . 
  yes it 's a scam , but i do n't think it 's greek that 's guilty of it here ( but hey i see glorious victim blamming is still going strong , especially when germans can fill their pocket looting their neighbors ) . 
   greeks were forced ? 
  yes , with outright blackmail . 
  `` join the eu or we will embargo you . 
  to join it , cook your books or we wo n't accept you . 
  oh and here 's another millions of bribes from rheinmetal to help convincing you and sell you some more german weapons you ca n't afford . 
  oh and there 's another 10 % loan for you to buy our defective submarines for 10b . 
  do n't worry we wo n't actually try delivering said subs and will refund half of it ten years down the line and pocket the other half using national debts as an excuse . 
  oh and do n't worry when the country will bankrupt due to us you wo n't be in power anymore it 'll be somebody 's else fault . 
  nah do n't worry about futur german govs either , we also already bribed the cdu '', 
   aka : comparative advantage not having a minimal wage & paying some people 50 $ / mo in germany to lower goods prices ever further & enforcing austerity on all neighbors was n't an `` advantage '' , it 's a scam on the back of everyone . 
  of course it 's cheaper when it 's based on quasi slave work ( see also : [ amazon warehouse work ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/brutal-conditions-in-amazons-warehouses-2013-8?ir=t ) ) . 
  they can deduct from sale prices half the wage they would have owed to workers in another country , and pocket the rest as extra benefit . 
   and doesnt gain from trade because he 's too lazy to make a product other countries want . 
  right , how dare workers in other countries hope to get paid ( let alone healthcare and pensions ! ), 
  for their work producing said goods . 
  greeks must indeed be `` lazy '' when they work 65h/week for 800 $ / mo / s  this is not `` economic dumping '' nobody forced greece to buy so much stuff . 
  actually , it would appear some foreign countries ( or , rather their financial sector that bribed some people in charge ) forced them to cook their books & take loans they could not pay back to cover up in the mean time , to enter the eu . 
  that might or might not include germany . 
   while your country still has income which the southern eu absolutely lack . 
   did n't vast majority of countries benefit from austerity measures in europe ? 
  well , i 'm sure the pension-less welfare-less greeks or those who have multi tens of thousands of euros of student loans `` benefited '' from it . 
  or maybe it 's the german banks . 
   paid off their debt quickly well , to pay back debts you kindah need an income . 
  the very thing austerity suppress . 
  probably the only ones with dozens of billions of surplus that got it by economic dumping while starving other countries ' economy with austerity . 
  gee , i wonder who could that be / s, 
   also french bank bnp illegally transferred funds for sudanese war lords , masking their identities because it knew it was breaking the law you probably say that because of my origin , but i think they should damn be jailed for it too . 
   french banks tend to be larger than american ones . . that bit is not true ; the us ones are bigger generally but cooks their books better to hide it . 
   are in the eu and china all the more the reason to crack down on such practices too . 
   countries want to collect taxes so they often dedicate a good amount of resources to it . 
  well , obviously not enough if people can just declare they are homed in the caimans & not pay anything . 
   will take time but luxembourg getting caught seems to have put this issue on everyone 's radar . 
  and it 's still far from being fixed . 
  estonia 's doing the same , and i 'm not even talking about some spanish islands i forgot the name or the well known swiss accounts behind all the jokes . 
   but ordinary people often did not know about it . 
  yeah they are waking up now because pension age was pushed de facto nearly 10 years back in france if you want to get it properly & old geezers forced back to work `` because there is no money '' . 
  then there is greece . 
  so of course now they start wondering why there is no money left . 
  populists politicians of course would rather blame immigrants than admit they got kickbacks to shield their oligarchs friends from all taxes . 
   now there are actual discussions about changing tax regulations within the eu yes , and from a discussion it will need to be transformed into acts ( eu & national tax reforms ; fraud crackdown , arresting the biggest frauders , anti corruption major actions , retro active tax recovery , etc ) . 
  talking about it is cheap , doing it another .
