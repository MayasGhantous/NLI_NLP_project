  ] ( http://balkans.liveuamap.com/en/2015/12-july-eurogroup-partially-refused-to-write-off-the-debt ) '' ( like the balkans during the greek crisis ) to `` no we refuse to participate in that safety emergency fund it 's an other-countries-not-us-problem-please-everyone-else-go-crash-and-burn-alone . '', 
  ( cough cough wolfgang sch\u00e4uble cough cough ) to `` we disagree with your gdp recalculations and do n't want to pay those additionnal amounts on the treaty scheduled dates '' ( ... how the end of 2014 and uk gdp recalculation nearly went , with the 2b ? ), 
  to `` we simply refuse to pay anything to the eu because_we_like_money_in_our_own_accounts_and_not_lazy_moochers_eastern_countries and eu budgets are only good if it 's money given to the uk . '', 
  ( what the ukip are saying right now ) . 
  i 'm obviously caricaturing and exagerating to make a bit of a point , but what happen 10 years down the line when somebody else will have replaced mr cameron , and said pm will look at all those old treaties and look for excuses to refuse sending tax money to the eu instead to use it all at home to quickly gather free votes instead ? 
  because an english version of donald trump or worse ( read : farage or way worse ) bulling his way to power and deciding something like that is actually a serious risk looking at the current situation . 
  so i hope this point will become clarified for our collective sakes , and anything related clearly written down in an explicit language and set in stone . 
  at my own level ; the rest of his points definitely makes sense tho . 
  it 's in fact obvious the uk does need to retain control of their own currency for the time being , to avoid getting drawn in another greek-like mess . 
  competitiveness i love how he remains ( willfully ? ), 
  vague . 
  does mr cameron care to expand on what he has specifically in mind ? 
  without further info in the letter , i looked for the uk 's interest on the topic on google . 
  looking for the red tape subject , i did found the following page on the uk gov website through google which seems full of ( really terrible ) ideas ( with carefully crafted statement to push decision maker to cut sick days or food laws ) : https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cut-eu-red-tape-report-from-the-business-taskforce ~ ~ i just hope `` cutting the red tape '' is not the flowery cover for that ultra `` supply side '' program that seems to make growth by cutting wages and environmental and food saftey norms and just putting the saved money in their pocket . 
  now i 'm sure the uk consumers will just love to eat all that us chlorine-infested chicken or tomatos treated with toxic pesticides without knowing it or seeing english rivers end up like that chinese one ( [ so toxic it caught fire nearly spontaneously , photos ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2574714/river-fire-chinese-waterway-polluted-bursts-flame-lit-cigarette-thrown-it.html ) ) for the sake of `` removing red tape '' / s ~ ~ more seriously , looking long term , all those ( formerly ) very high social safety standards are the reason europe is a world-class first rank super power , it 's not all just red tape like the city constantly claim . 
  and ending all that for a decade of even ( let 's be crazy ) 5 more % of corporate growth based on immediate additionnal profits would seem a bad idea . 
  that said i found that page too ( which brings back hope in current english policy as in fact very reasonable  : http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150522175321/http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rtc-measures-december-2014.xlsx which on the other hand seems pretty efficient at simplifying & consolidating without sacrificing standards ? 
  stop me if i 'm wrong , i only flied over a part of the long list . 
  uk sovereignty  i want to end britain 's oblivation to work towards an `` ever closer union '' ( ... ) in a formal , legally-binding and irreversible way . 
  i 'd advocate that it could be done in an way that , the uk wo n't be asked to join an `` ever closer union '' without their own ( uk 's ) specific interest in renegociating it . 
  ( de facto , the current statut quo looks a very reasonable option . ), 
  how about the uk decide ( as in `` an english decision , whether at the uk pm level or if they want to organize a referendum '' ) , decides in 10 or 20 years themselves whether they want ( or likely refuse if current projections keeps on ) to get a bit closer in , depending on the economic/social situation the rest of the eu might reach at that time . 
  it do seems reasonable to give the uk a ( treaty , written down , legally binding ) garanty that the eu ( or other eu countries , allied instances , etc ) wo n't force them in a closer union , especially one that they do n't want to join or stay in ( that is if they stay that long and do n't decide to leave the eu before at the referendum ) . 
   we all know that 's not going to happen . 
  deportations from germany to italy/netherlands/austria / poland/france / ... ( or even back to turkey or jordan ) ? 
  oh hell yes it could happen . 
  and nobody 's going to bat an eye for it . 
  ( oops reply to wrong the wrong line , sorry ignore my other post ), 
  and then we can certainly refuse them asylum in germany . 
  it goes both ways really . 
  there are worse fates for syrians than follow a few crash courses and the local rules of life in society that apply to everyone . 
  and less interesting places to live even in europe . 
  while we offered them asylum ( and even a too generous one says a lot of people ) , that 's not a pass to ignore local laws and society . 
  not sure i understand what you mean, 
   she told german jews to go back to the far east . 
  ( why the far east ? 
  nobody knows ) probably taking a page from staline : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_autonomous_oblast, 
  erh . 
  do we * really * want to imprison 90y old geezers who did n't act nazi themselves ? 
  a huge fine would probably be more appropriate ? 
  hum . 
  yes we can certainly ask them to adopt our values if they want to stay . 
  that 's definitely their end of the contract they have to respect . 
  we 're not asking them to eat pork or drink alcohol if they do n't want to obviously , but they should definitely respect others who do and respect the local culture , learn the language , get a job to help sustain themselves without welfare when possible , and put their kids in school . 
  edit : and the obvious i nearly forgot , and treat women well/as equal . 
  edit  i can tell you that it took me at least six months to understand why people were shouting at me for walking on the `` pavement '' ( aka , the bike lane . ), 
  it took me ages to get on board with the perfectionist recycling program , or to understand `` thou shalt not discard a bottle with pfand ( deposit ) '' is the eleventh commandment in this country . 
  well that 's certainly something we can teach them in a quick crash training . 
  the known `` do and do n't do '' . 
   if a foreigner assaults someone , or , say , fraudulently installs faulty emissions systems in hundreds of thousands of automobiles , subtle like a brick haha, 
  ... are you real man ? 
  i 'm suggesting less work hour for them for same pay , and you are accusing me of supporting scaming them ? 
  hey , nice catch, 
  hu i deleted my own initial post by habbit , sorry ( i tend to retro cut some of my background chatter ), 
  talking about that i heard a lot of good on the grippen . 
  any opinion on it ? 
  when your planning is a constant `` 40 +20 unpaid '' it 's a disguised 60h planning . 
  `` cutting the abusive unpaid perpetual overtime '' would then just become just a nice euphemism for de facto cutting the real hours . 
  sorry to be * that * guy , but do we have independant confirmation from a well known press agency ? 
   it 's time to realize that poland is very nationalistic and even wants to fight russia with the help of the western nations . 
  you really managed to twist a `` eu flag burned by nationalists '' into `` eu and poland plot the downfall of russia !, 
  i 'm impressed and see the persecution complexe is still going strong, 
   ( except possibly to reduce excessive overtime and/or to reduce extended shifts . ), 
  looks like you answered your own question . 
  yes . 
  also if i ever sell a famas on ebay it 'll be with the description `` brand new perfect shape , dropped only once '' , i know :p i should ask for a buck every time somebody tell me those jokes , i 'd bail out greece & ukraine , 
  i 'm surprized you did n't packed a surrender joke in it, 
  so essentially they want pay rises , more ressources to do their job ; and recruiting more personnal to reduce their hours ( at same wage ) would allow to reduce the pressure on everyone ? 
  well , [ fdr was hospitalised in secret multiple times and was stuck in wheel chair too ( while hidding it with party tricks ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franklin_d._roosevelt's_paralytic_illness ) , so since there was historical precedence i did n't ruled it out as a possibility . 
   you ca n't deport people against their will . 
  technically you can sure have 2 cops/security guards manhandle them in a plane toward their home country . 
   giving them citizenship would be the quickest way to solve things . 
  the screams from the right wing would n.e.v.e.r end . 
  yeah it 's how sith lords works right ? 
  replacing their teacher . 
  joke apart he obviously always hoped to become the one and only leader in germany . 
  nothing new, 
  appropriate nickname i guess ? 
   but mr sch\u00e4uble spoke out in support of the idea . 
  `` of course we have to limit family reunification , because our capacity is not unlimited , '' he told ard television . 
  speeding up deportations of refused citizens could help too . 
  annnd , ( damn , that burns to say it but ) ; sch\u00e4uble might be right on the time limit too ( they will have to return home once the war is over . 
  most of them wo n't be able to claim persecution . ) . 
  limitating family reunion for refugees claiming asylum from in eu ( `` illegals '' ) would also * defacto * reduce temptation to rush in illegally in europe and might push some of them to head in neighboring country ( but if they close their borders too , possibly to stay in turkey/jordan/lebannon , or in some cases in syria ; or to abandon their family members in syria for the lack of any other option . 
  but technically if they are n't yet in the system and make a run in france from germany we 'd have trouble refusing everyone too ; and deportations to syria would be problematic ) . 
   i know what you 're saying but ` non corrupt ' pm ? 
  hence the need for new names . 
  new politicians that does n't have a laundry past of money stealing and deals . 
  reforming the system . 
   do you know that there 's the same majority in power anyway ? 
  so do n't elect them anymore ? 
   the one pulling the strings there is an ex minister sentenced for voting fraud then maybe he should be arrested too and not allowed to name new pm 's ? 
   theres no such thing damnit stop with that mentality right now . 
  this is exactly what they are counting on and it 's enabling their corruption . 
  ~ ~ i do n't care if we have to fire & jail a dozen pm before we found one that is n't trying to run with the cash register , keep looking . ~ ~, 
  does he have any non corrupt pm material in sight ? 
  if not , maybe this is something the opposition can work on too ; offering new names in politics that are n't dirty . 
  just another wwii relic like countless other we randomly find , no need for needless alarm, 
  well he was the one raving about the `` futur great wall of trump '' and how he 'd threathen mexico to force them to build it and pay for it . 
   the uae 's internal foreign office papers claim the muslim brotherhood is `` ingrained '' in british society , and characterise the group as a potential fifth column which has `` been masterful in working undercover and presenting themselves in a veneer of moderation '' .
