  in one form of the other . 
  and just before the same periode the usa was under english rule . 
  should the uk re invade them ? 
   58 % declare themselves ethnic russians . 
  that part is n't in the bbc article you link . 
   the most recent figures the figures from the kremlin that just `` convinced '' everyone with tanks and guns they totally loved being invaded ? 
  right . 
   you say the data from the 2001 census is fake and to prove it you talk about edit wars on mh17 . 
  so if i edit the wikipedia page too to turn the stats to say that the 2001 census declare 80 % of rostov , russia declares itself ethnic ukrainian , will you believe it ? 
   no quebecan will say they 're ethnic french . 
  well they would if i had a rifle pointed at them and their family and declared i would `` protect the french ethnic minority , even from themselves '' . 
  ** btw , according still to this , no less than 28 % of quebec do consider themselves of french ethnic origin ** : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_quebec#ethnic_origin http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?lang=e&amp;geo=pr&amp;code=24&amp;table=2&amp;data=count&amp;startrec=1&amp;sort=3&amp;display=all&amp;csdfilter=5000 see how that definition is pretty loose ? 
  well if there 's a bit less corruption every years maybe it 'll go somewhere !, 
  if you set your emissions standards where the tradeoffs are too severe for diesel , i 'd think that you 'd get electrics or something else constructed anyway obviously it 's not that simply since the manufacturers caught for fraud openly bribed or blackmailed their way out of the standards . 
  hence the current title topic `` eu caves in '' . 
  there has to be alternatives on the market to force them to adapt or they wont . 
  and without government-level interference , it wo n't happen because it 's simpler for corporations to wire the r&d budget to the ceo & shareholders as a `` end of the year bonus '' than do the actual researchs with it . 
  alors l\u00e0 c'est de l'invention * totale * . 
   well crimea should n't have been given to ukraine from the beginning . 
  a lot of what ukraine is nowadays is just bits and pieces of former countries . 
   it 's a frankenstein of states ukraine la carte d'ukraine ressemble effectivement pas \u00e0 celle d' y \u00e0 1 si\u00e8cle . 
   we never do talk about the genocides and land grabs committed by the ukranians , do we ? 
  what about wwii . 
  and i say that as a french . 
  that used to be the case . 
  they are renewing the police and trying to crack down on the mafia ( which mostly works for oligarchs , ie robber barons ) . 
  that did sound like serious apathetic defeatism . 
   under the deal , the eu and switzerland will automatically exchange information on the bank accounts of each other 's residents , starting in 2018 . 
  excellent news :-), 
  `` the gov will never stop having corrupt politicians and corporations corrupt executives so let 's try nothing '' uh ? 
   still , making actual diesel from the secondary plant sources ( those not used for food and that grow without using many resources ) , after hydrogenation , is one of the roads explored ( it 's called `` green diesel '' ) . 
  which will bring the barrel to 250 $ and still wo n't solve any of the smog or climate issues nor pad us from the economic shock . 
  you call that a `` solution '' ? 
  that 's only the temporary makeshift patch we can throw at the problem when we run out overnight and everybody 's yelling `` fuck fuck fuck how do i get at work tomorrow ? '' . 
   but it also gives me hope that the giant steps forward that we 've made will continue , maybe even in a difficult market like fuels . 
  that 's not a solution , that 's only kicking the can down the road a year or two at best . 
  then there 's the obvious issue you and i both carefully avoided mentioning about how that could potentially replace food crops if it actually became really profitable because overnight big oil would happily buy half the planet and starve everyone to death to sell one more barrel of `` oil '' . 
  ~ ~ hell , they already killed half the middle east for it . ~ ~  if you want to remove fossil fuels from the cars , you have to put it in big electric plants to produce more power for the grid so that you can charge those cars . 
  ( ... ) french nuclear powerplants defacto already power a third of europe . 
  \\* shrugs \\*  most likely , a significant piece of that power has to be generated by burning fossil fuels in some of those plants . 
  even if we were retarded enough to suddenly decide we do n't want 90 % of our production capacity ; using diesel to run powerplants and electric car would still be dozens of times more efficient than using directly fuel in cars . 
  hell , according to the tesla guys if we replaced every npp with a unfiltered coal one ( worst case scenario ) and used only electric car it would still be largely more clean for the environment than keep using even `` clean '' fossil cars . 
   a complete nuclearization for civil purposes or covering big portions of territory with photovoltaic panels seem to be impractical as of now . 
  why , you want to take away our current power grid ? 
  and no , it would n't need significant increases : by charging most cars at night during down times it would n't need additionnal plants to recharge them . 
   personally , i believe that it 's urgent that we take advantage of the high population density of europe and make public transit as powerful and widespread as possible i agree too ( especially as somebody who does n't use a personnal car ) , but some people obviously ca n't live without cars , and they remain pretty usefull to go off the public transport grid like villages or any isolated area . 
  trucks are also a pretty indispensable part of freight so they are not going away either . 
  we 're not going to be able to remove cars & trucks from society , not now , not in 20 years . 
  so we have to keep pushing for alternatives to oil while there is still time and not when we 'll have constant eu crisis meetings like for greece or the migrants . 
   it 's still far from the norm to have an lng car ) iirc we killed that project in france after a few years due to stability issues ( ie we had accidents were the cars outright exploded violently ) . 
  so apparement having certain newly illegal books or having such and such nationality can get you arrested again in russia . 
   hydrocarbons do n't come just from fossil fuels . 
  the petrolchemical giants have been investing in research to make fuels from all sorts of `` bio-based '' sources , yeah , like the diester we can use to run diesel engines , i know . . 
  still it 's going to be a lot more costly than oil ( per liter ) unless we can `` save it '' for the already existing cars & trucks and limit new fossil fuel vehicules on the market . 
   when the petroleum runs out there will be plenty of alternatives to make the same fuels with similar processes but from different sources . 
  biodiesel alone wo n't save us from the economic crash and links with the ksa and similar consequences ; and certainly wo n't save us from environmental damages . 
  slowly weening us from our dependancy on oil would pad us a lot from the oil crash , system-wide speaking . 
  starting by introducing new electric vehicules without making ( yet ) the old ones illegals would allow us to slowly replace most of the park over a decade or two . 
  it could also seriously strengthen the position of our auto industry world wide should it be a success ( it could be a prime choice for export ) . 
  as you also pointed out we also still have some kinks to work out , and that will take serious time and engineering so it 's better we start now instead of rushing toward half assed solutions in 10/20y with a giant immediate social problem on our hands ( citizens without oil to commute ) . 
  eu-led investments in a serious program on the subject could have a good return on investment 10 years down the line if successfull ( think airbus but without the price of an airplane ) . 
  looks like tesla does n't have so much problem with it ? 
  20sec on google : https://transportevolved.com/2015/02/11/much-range-tesla-model-s-electric-car-lose-winter-one-owner-figures/ http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1091687_norwegian-man-with-seven-teslas-says-electric-cars-work-just-fine-in-winter-weather http://my.teslamotors.com/fr_fr/forum/forums/battery-range-winter-or-during-very-cold-periods http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/videos/a14085/tesla-p85d-test-drive/ while it does affect range , they clearly indicate still being able to do hundreds of km with it . 
  might it be slightly exagerated , like the `` normal '' autonomy issue ( '' * it 's impossibru to reach more than 75km !, 
  * '' ) , by manufacturers that would rather keep making profits without doing much on already designed gas cars ? 
  even if there is one , down the line , it 's the kind of questions engineers will have to face , instead of throwing their hands and pointing out it 's cheaper and bring more profits to just fill the tank with diesel . 
   or just do n't buy diesel vehicles . 
  there will never be anything like a `` clean diesel '' and it should be clear to everybody with a basic understanding of how a diesel engine works . 
  there will never be a `` clean '' fossil fuel car , period . 
  so we can keep dragging this problem until the petro crash ruins us , or we can start working on introducing modern real electric cars on the market asap to start transition which is going to take 20y either way and might spare us another risk of social collapse for a few bucks . 
  ( as for most car buyers they do n't give a flying f ** ck about the environment , they 'll just go for the cheaper ; esp with the economic crisis . ), 
  well ; maybe a simpler way to solve the issue would be serious subsidies to develop an eu-designed and built ( i mean built in an eu country and not delocalized ) advanced electric car ( or serie of models ) . 
  with a high range ( 400 + km on a charge . 
  do n't say it 's impossible since some teslas do have 800 + in practice ) ; a `` cheap '' 15k $ - like price ( also no `` battery monthly subscription '' bs ) and capable of [ fast charge ( 20-60min `` supercharge '' ; refilling half the battery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tesla_station#how_it_works ) ) . 
  develloping an electric charger network on the highways would also help ; and using economic incentives ( higher taxes for new diesel/gas cars ; cheaper for electrics ) could also help shape the market . 
  how do corrupt gov and invading armies proceed to loot anything ? 
  ( no i 'm not about to write you a step by step instruction manual ), 
  the inflation is older than that . 
  the uah price was manipulated and artificially maintained to 1 $ = 15uah by the gov before to hide it . 
  yanukovich had stole and ran the remnants of the economy into the ground and hidden it ( or somebody around him smarter did it but anyway ) short term by buying uah with ( quickly diminishing ) gov 's foreign currency reserves then debts . 
  the new ( less corrupt gov ) realized ( when y ' ran away to russia ) they could n't afford it ( because yanukovich stole and wasted everything ) if they wanted to avoid bankruptcy ( they had only months worth of cash left ) . 
  so they stopped mass uah buyings with debts ; and essentially the market snapped back to 2y old reality ( 1 $ = 25 uah ) . 
   gdp forecast for this year -15 % that do happen when your two top economic regions are 1 \u00b0 ) invaded then stolen/annexed by a russian army ( tourism in crimea ) 2 \u00b0 ) invaded then stolen/destroyed by a russian army ( donetsk/luhansk ), 
  they probably really have 80b left in the piggy bank once you account for everything that comes out of that fund like pensions . 
  lots of politicians stole from it . 
  tho a lot of pressure was released since they stopped moving in donestk/luhansk , so they have a lot more time now ( several years ) instead of months . 
  and in exchange for war/crimea prisonners most of the sanctions would go away so they 'd have decades to figure out a solution ( e.g : investing in economic diversification & industry ) if they helped there . 
  well ; nobody forced him to come or stay here . 
  i guess the locals can define the gov and citizenship papers how they damn want . 
  the caliphate is the other way . 
  \\* points towards a daesh-invaded hellhole in syria \\* edit : to address the `` he was born & raised here '' ; if you support daesh then obviously you have n't been raised dane enough ; and support for that group borderly qualify on treason . 
  sadly , one does not preclude the other, 
   most people could n't though people are always clever when it comes to disappear & escape unnoticed . 
  especially world class scientists . 
  and the usa really took advantage ( not in a bad sense for the persons , but a serious disadventage to russia itself ) of mass fleeing russian scientists and worked hard to recruit them . 
   and they noted that they had a lot of voluntary home travellers back when the kurds did their own litte autonomous region i guess this is one of the real positive notes in the middle east stories  i still do n't get why they do n't have just huge posters with the average time you have to spend waiting for your process to start , for your process to finish , etc plastered over every wall on the balkan route . 
  +1 ; and indication of current low rates of success for people from safe contries, 
  ah so just like the old soviet era . 
  autarcy here they go . 
  the scientists having kgb handlers constantly over their shoulder made them flee the country by the number .
