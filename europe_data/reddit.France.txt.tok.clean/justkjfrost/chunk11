  but let 's hope your optimism is well placed ; that 'd be the best for everyone haha . 
  the issue with qatar is delicate because they fund a lot of things in the country ( not politicians , i mean actual things like schools & stadium & roads & industry & companies , tv networks , imports , etc etc ) in a lot of very varied domains & we 're kind of hurting for cash . 
  so the gov is reticent to push the issue against them right now . 
  edit : to be clear you need to look the bigger picture . 
  it 's not just about the money . 
  every time they fund a school or stadium , it 's that much less kids radicalized . 
  so bigger picture , it de facto lessens the issue . 
  sa is a problem tho ( but they have been paying lip service with things like their last elections ) . 
  they 'll need to stop spreading wahhabism tho . 
   try to improve their living conditions so less are tempted to fuck everything up ( left ) =  not working because they ca n't do it . 
  would be funny if it was n't so damn true haha . 
   imho , to solve the issue : improve living conditions , stop making them feel 2nd grade citizens , get french-based imams ( who 'll promote a moderate islam ) . 
  this guys has it right . 
  and we 're already doing that : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/23/france.islam, 
   if it was illegal it would not be worth it for companies uhhhh . 
  right . 
  like the us banks `` too big to fail '' that fund the mexican mafia despite it being illegal ? 
  or like the libor bankers , who damn knew how illegal what they did was and that it 'd fuck the economy out of billions straight to their pockets ? 
   there would still be illegal evasion , but large companies would largely see it as not worth the risk in my opinion . 
  to be honest , people are going to accuse me to push my agenda ; but truly we 're at the point where companies do n't pay any taxes on dozens of billions of euros of yearly benefits ( like in 50 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 $ ) while populists politicians love to blame it against the `` moochers welfarer '' and cut people out of 500 $ / mo of welfare ( \\* points the frontpage of / r/europe \\* ) and nearly start witch hunts against greeks & others because-austerity-there-is-no-money-left-them - ~ ~ jooz ~ ~ immigrants-and-lazy-pensioners-not-working-steal-our-living . 
  do n't you think it 's `` just a bit '' insane ? 
   so your estimate might actually be a little low . 
  most likely ( x100 . 
  ) , but people wo n't believe me ( and a big part of it is likely already lost ) . 
  we already have a few dozen trillionaires world wide hidding , but we ca n't pay for basic pensions & welfare or national debts in major countries because none of them pay any taxes . 
   so any of this money that is recovered likely wont be able to be taxed if we ca n't figure out that one for legalese bullshit reasons and the eu bankrupt or they start cutting utilities to millions ( like creditors wanted to do to the greeks , or like it happened in detroit & puerto rico ; so do n't tell me it 'll never happen ) ; we 'll have a maidan ( or syrian war ... ) . 
  a brutal one where every millionaires & more & state officials the population get their hands on will get brutally butchered one by one & people start burning down government buildings by the dozen & being a banker or financial executive is being a very dead man in a cruel manner . 
  and right now the eu is several hundred of billions off . 
  every single important bit like the social security , pensions & co are off because some people are making * all * the money in the system ( ... trillions ) and all of them are above taxes . 
  maybe it would be saner to recover that tax money one way or another before people start dying out by the tens of thousands of the whole story ? 
  ( oh & btw talking about utilities , our power company in france managed to [ legally pass retroactive price rise upon the last 2 years and withdraw it without real notice from everyone 's bank account . 
  ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2014/04/11/tarifs-de-l-electricite-la-justice-impose-une-hausse-retroactive_4399937_3234.html ) if the gov can do that , i believe we can retroactively apply taxes to billionaires & more too . ), 
   but at least if we fix things things wo n't be fixed before we recover that money to wipe our debts ( debts that mainly happened because the economy refused to pay taxes & made the tax payers take loans for everything instead ) . 
   you realize by far most tax avoidance occurs using eu countries and subsidiaries . 
  no , they are generally using dutch sandwich like process and redeclare their fiscal home in tax havens and do n't pay anything in the eu either . 
   ut companies will not stop doing it as long as it is legal well then time to make it illegal and start jailing people for it when they still do n't stop . 
   it is up to the european countries i listed above to change their regulations just like it 's up to the us senate to end the legal aspect of their bribes ? 
  more seriously , laws will have to be passed at eu levels for tax harmonisation & cracking down on fraud . 
  otherwise , there will always be a luxembourg that will help everyone frauding everything in exchange for kickbacks . 
   france , germany , and the uk should apply more pressure to help change these practices . 
  100 % agreed !, 
   although after the fraud in luxembourg it seems like things might be getting better eventually . 
  well ; there 's probably like at least 1-2t ( 10/20 % of gdp ) recoverable floating in the eu shadow economy , hiding in tax heavens & undeclared accounts . 
  i wo n't say things run `` better '' while we did n't even recovered more than a few dozen billions of it & not paying any taxes ( by calling it evasion ) is still legal . 
   more avoidance because what they are doing is completely legal . 
  whether it 's legal or not , what happens is that some millionaire people become billionaire people , billionaires people a lot richer , everyone else become poor , and there is a huge state deficit in every european countries that end up with greece , italy , spain , portugal , ireland , ... economic disasters where even having 1k $ / mo job is winning a lottery and where potable tap water is [ becoming a rare comodity ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/puerto-rico-grappling-potentially-historic-drought-expands-water-rationing-1971400 ) because the state is filling bankruptcy . 
  just like because us congressmen voted that their bribes were legal by renaming it `` campaign contributions '' does n't mean it 's not a mafia practice . 
  `` evasion '' is also legal and also a mafia habit . 
  `` but oh everyone does steal legally like that , why should i stop ? '', 
   well , congratulations on using russian or greek approach to the economy ( the mafia oligarchic one ) . 
  if you do n't see what 's wrong with giant evasion everywhere , whether they already managed to bribe their way in legalizing it or not , i hope you are prepared for the part that come next ( where you are actually part of the 99 % dirt poor fucked over ) . 
  but oh well , it 's like zombie movie . 
  everyone thinks they 're the 1 % ers badass ones that makes it to the end while they 'd all be in the zombies . 
  fact is , people need to face the fact that this `` evasion '' shit is simply fraud that bribed it 's way in legality ; or long term our economy and lifestyle will be history . 
  ( and that 's just the `` legal '' part that we hear about . ), 
  i 'd say reality is it 's much higher ( 10x ? 
  more ? 
  in your average western country tax & financial fraud is ubiquitous at high level ... oh sorry , it 's largely called `` tax optimization '' and `` evasion '' nowadays . 
  the corporate and finance-linked shadow economy is immense and invisible . ) . 
  i mean stuff like the libor scandal alone represent dozens of billions . 
  they are bragging and can legitimately do it about how much they recovered back from all that omnipresent fraud . 
   thats after the war though . 
  uhhh . 
  lets look at wiki :  combat operations , ethnic cleansing , and the fear of genocide resulted in millions of people being uprooted from their homes in the course of world war ii . 
  you think this happened `` after '' the war ? 
  also relevant : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee#1933_.28rise_of_nazism.29_to_1944 millions fled abroad , largely to the usa/uk but also to africa , south america , ... edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_evacuation_and_expulsion just that alone :  eventually during nazi occupation up to 1.6 to 2 million poles were expelled , not counting millions of slave labourers deported from poland, 
  during wwii ? 
  uhhhhhh . 
  let me tell you you are somewhat misinformed : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/displaced_persons_camp, 
   death sentence my ass you ever saw what it 's like there ? 
  let me help you : http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02812/barrel_bomb_05_2812373a.jpg http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/5225950-3x2-940x627.jpg http://www.vivelohoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/154155638_result.jpg or just generally : https://www.google.com/search?q=syria+war+damages&amp;tbm=isch&amp;gws_rd=ssl#gws_rd=ssl https://www.google.com/search?q=aleppo+damages&amp;tbm=isch&amp;gws_rd=ssl#gws_rd=ssl and you ca n't see the daily fire from every sides . 
  tell me how we should send people back in the middle of that while fighting is still at it 's high point ? 
  see that first picture ? 
  that 's a barrel bomb dropped by the regime . 
  that drop litterally dozens of them a day in every major towns ( sometimes a lot more ) . 
  deporting back tens of thousands of civilians by force in the middle of that do qualify as a `` death sentance '' in my books . 
  at the very least the fighting would need to stop first & the reconstruction begin ; and/or they should be militarily protected ( safe zone ) . 
   no country in europe sends refugees back after the end of the conflict , and hardly none of them ever go back . 
  well , there you have the problem then . 
  and yelling wo n't change anything about it . 
   why do n't you house the refugees in your own house / s probably because i do n't ( bother to ) have a house ? 
  but in my country or as neighbors ? 
  sure , no issue . 
   if not syria and turkey , physical space is never hard to come by riiiight . 
  http://i.imgur.com/4xeek.jpg  it 's the buildings and equipment that is the problem and that can be built . 
  looking at the ( stupidly high . ), 
  number of empty buildings in france due to speculators ( who tends to act like hedge funds ) i 'm sure we do have a lot of place de facto . 
  ( edit : but thinking about it you 're right we could send some funds to turkey to help limiting the raw numbers tho ), 
   and if turkey ca n't , we may make a protected zone inside syria and make something there instead of course ; you provide the army to do so ? 
  because the usa wo n't , and most of nato is busy pretending they ca n't either . 
   and having to care for them and their extended family for a generation or more ( long after the war is over ) . 
  can you stop making up bs ? 
  first thing , it should be the length of the war . 
  second thing , if they work , the bring in economic growth . 
  not loss . 
   so build more shelters with the money ... 
  it 's not just about the money and shelters . 
  turkey ca n't just add take another 2m refugees . 
  so a few thousands in other countries to spread the load makes it a lot more viable . 
  both sides hides their casualties .
