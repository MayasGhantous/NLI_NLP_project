  well for once we ca n't complain he 's wasting tons of money and fuel . 
  romania had a major problem of corruption so he 's probably trying to set a good example plus he 's right , they should take the lei and convert at their own level , that 's just bad form ( imagine you ca n't get coffee during a long flight and ca n't even have some in the bag because liquids are banned and they turn down your money , brr ), 
  does n't mean we should dismiss the risk of further attempt to entice riots ( or that story of plot in montenegro ), 
  i guess `` flamming on facebook '' just took a new meaning, 
  the flag of ... the facebook country ? 
  okay that 's a new one edit ^ meanwhile [ ^ with ^ yuropean ^ flag ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxkv07ghkiw ), 
   source . 
  for example http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-conventions/donald-trump-remarks-nato-trigger-alarm-bells-europe-n613911, 
  you realize in two month he 'll be ~ ~ sup ` com ~ ~ '' commander in chief of the united states ' armed forces '' with full backing of both rep dominated houses , on top of having openly stated repeatedly he wanted to leave europe and nato and that was russian land ? 
  you just do n't take that kind of chance when you are in that kind of case . 
  as much as i like the us , i ca n't bet my country and safety on trump suddenly reversing his decision and campaign come january ( esp since we basically lost both brexit and that election ) so european remilitarization it is . 
  we need to be able to defend our borders if the need arise . 
   oh , and thanks for these blokes . 
  was expecting the [ monthy pythons ] ( https://67.media.tumblr.com/1721e235dbe9f5af7ee331c74e739655/tumblr_nj8bb5tkys1u2qrtko1_500.jpg ) , admittedly, 
  because obviously banning humor on the internet is totally going to work and totally not totalitarian censorship ? 
   the proposal comes a year after the introduction of the controversial citizens ' safety law , popularly known as the `` gag law '' , which limits people 's right to demonstrate and has seen individuals fined for criticising spanish authorities on social networks . 
  if pp wants to be even more openly hated by the youth that 's the way to go . 
   the pp used its once-comfortable parliamentary majority to steamroller through the gag law , something it could not do now after elections last december and in june failed to produce a clear result . 
  how could they possibly have lost electoral influence after having treated their citizen like shit , truly i ca n't see any possible link / s, 
   before myron ebell got into the whole climate change denying racket , he worked on policy for the tobacco industry , where he claimed cigarettes did n't cause cancer . 
  that 's concerning, 
   measures against tax evasion ongoing i believe  an industrial policy to rebuild high-tech industries need to expand there i agree , but there are already a few things like airbus  pan-european infrastructure projects in energy , transport and telecoms . 
  there are work on the telecom ; and the eu funded highways and railroads everywere . 
  european energy is something getting investigated currently . 
   agreement on the unitary patent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patent_law_of_the_european_union ? 
   military cooperation and joint procurement  solution to the migrant crisis getting investigated currently too i believe  improved cooperation with our southern and eastern neighbors there is a social problem there , agreed . 
  \\* cough \\* italy/greece/spain \\* cough \\*  trade deals with china and other emerging markets it 's being studied i think, 
   and sorry , but there 's no such thing as a `` common culture '' in europe european/western values are a thing i think . 
   the word you 're probably looking for is `` federalist '' . 
  or pan european . 
  a party with a branch in every main eu countries . 
   as a greek person , i feel much closer culturally to turkey and the greater anatolia region than to , say , nordic countries you feel closer to erdogan-led turkey ? 
  that 's a new one  and i 'm pretty sure the average swedish or norwegian person feels they have little in common with me as far as culture is concerned ... well if you were in turkey you likely would n't be here because there 'd be a 1/2 that social media would be blocked for you too . 
  internet is censored in major part of the turkish country since a week . 
  plus you 'd actually be ranting about `` european terror supporters '' i guess, 
   of course this party must be a serious one not something common people would consider a toy for the intelligenzia to be honest every new party first started that way before being finally relevant, 
  and then , things went worse . 
   mostly they vehemently blame russia for being so inactive that they have to suffer the current government . 
  ohhh so when you sung `` crimea is ours '' at tank back in simferopol and donetsk that 's just a summer tube or ? 
   ' a wave of t90 ' in france is as possible in the next 10 years no not in france , in estonia/latvia/lithuania / poland/moldova/romania / balkans . 
   hint : currently both do n't even exist . 
  tell that to the ukrainians . 
  quoting skynews or the independant for a source on hired killers , lulz . 
  you 're aware they recently got caught making up those articles and paying people to act like it on tv ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/10/sky-news-defends-report-on-gun-running-amid-claims-of-faked-meeting it 's the same circle that owns and order both media groups around . 
  they pushed fear and propaganda on eastern europe to push for brexit because their owners made a lot of money ( litterally dozens billions a year ) on governmental fund embezzlement the eu was investigating that article you published is likely another invention to stir up xenophobia edit : yes i saw the 97 date , but it 's not the first article and proofs and datation completely invented . 
  it 's not hard to change the servers ' clock before posting an article you know . 
  edit : i mean , an article that start by '' * in the semi-darkness of an early january morning , the body of brandon hale was discovered by a woman walking her dog . 
  the 48-year-old gambler was lying face up in woods in north london . 
  above his left eye was a neat hole made by a single bullet . * '' . 
  it 's not an article on real news , it 's an agatta christie fanfic writing . 
   hired killers are far cheaper . 
  not really . 
  i would hazard you have to find one in the first place , then convince him to prices you could pay ; then you 'd have to hope this is n't law enforcement in disguise like most are haha ( no i never tried to hire hitmen but i saw the police-side of such stings op a couple time ; as a citizen most `` hitmen '' you can come across seem to be either law enforcement or a junky that is going to botch it ; but maybe things are somewhat different in the east ) plus that would n't solve the legal case because another judge would be appointed and you 'd be suspected of murder on top of it, 
  you know ukrainians earn like 100 $ / month with the shoddy conversion rate and spend all of it on barely scrapping by right now right ? 
  that 's why the discovery of yanukovich 's gold platted home , gold platted private boat ( [ i mean , litterally ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/media/images/73164000/jpg/_73164220_021266296.jpg ) . ), 
  on an artificial lake and gold plated car collection outraged so many ( then there were the even more infamous gold platted restroom and ~ ~ goldplated ~ ~ pure [ gold bread replica ] ( https://www.kyivpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/30/p18rm5vtcvnombs6hi91rf81lv04/original.jpg ) in the kitchen ; while thousands in kiev could n't afford food anymore . ), 
  there 's no ukrainian with 100k to bribe a minor prosecutor apart the oligarchs or their friends . 
  that 'd be shokin i 'd agree it 's likely bribery , but here we 're talking of a side player that probably does n't warrant that kind of bribe, 
  had to be family 's money . 
  she ca n't have stolen that much at 25 already , takes a couple more year for that ( being 30 + i 'd hazard ) that said that does n't mean some of it should n't be taken for the gov as due tax . 
  repairs & ammo & stuff to keep everyone safe there are n't going to pay themselves . 
   the real outrage here is that a prosecutor earns just $ 2,870 a year that encourage corruption yeah : / tbh like with cops that got a rise , wages will have to be adjusted higher in normal proportion to reduce tentation of stealing vastly bigger sums, 
   with the european maritime group , eurocorps , the european gendarmerie force and the eu battlegroups the basis already exists . 
  they are not integrated , not trained for rapid reaction or to fight russians , and certainly not ready for a war as of now sadly ( a gendarm is n't somebody that mans a frontline against a wave of t90 ) . 
  however , you are right to point out that they would be appropriate recruitement pools . 
   we do n't even need a full fledged eu army for that . 
  yes we do ; because if the russians goes in , they are going to send their army like in ukraine . 
  and the only thing that actually stopped them there was sheer firepower . 
   if the media is playing for the house the media was playing for both trump & hillary . 
  and both lied ( but trump a lot more dangerously by blamming it on part of the population ; with mexicans and foreigners and muslims and other groups pointed out to be ostracized and treated like dirt ) . 
  and trump had better liars on his campaign with social media on 4chan ( the invisible youth swing vote that went `` alt right '' ) so he won . 
  that likely mean we need to be able to plan for a case where the russians decide to pay us a military visit and trump suddenly withdraw all soldiers & run back to the us . 
  having a trained operational reserve & rapid reaction forces for the baltics to drop on the front within hours would be a must have . 
  and it 'll need to be made of european people & with european leadership ( so that they ca n't be ordered away from the front ) . 
  to be honest , it would be nice to have at least 3-5 000 men , 20-50 tanks , 5 + warplanes , 20 + artillery ( the more the better !, 
  ) , and a warship or two ( with sufficient anti submarine defenses ) capable of naval heavy fire support ( when you just need a tank column gone . ), 
  at the ready for that kind of case ( ca n't we sell a couple stealth fremm to the baltics ? ) . 
  fortunately , it 's probable that the united baltics are capable of providing at least half that list already . 
  ( those are just initial numbers to buy time enough to ramp up the army for war with russia should that happen ), 
   populists and extremists rising in europe that 's largely happening because lying in the media is becoming ok and rampantly used by some factions to stay or take political power . 
  the more politicians lies , the less trust the system gets as a whole , the more the pressure will rise , and the more damage it 'll do to society as a whole . 
  please note that tis is n't just in occident . 
  that 's how duterte ended up in power for example . 
  lack of trust in politicians . 
  but hey cheap immediate sweet sweet vote seem to have taken the priority , even if that means writing `` 350m '' on the side of the truck and openly gloating like farage after the vote that your voters where `` so naive '' the more you do that , the more politics will be thrown over the window the day people decide they are really fed up because trump will screw up or laugh in open mic by accident that his voters are idiots the acceptance of open propaganda and political lies are killing our society . 
  we 'll need to hold people accountable for that at some point ( at the very least by stopping lying repeatedly ) , or the mob will do it for us with torchs and pitchforks . 
  see all those people that think america will be made great again . 
  what do you think will happen when the republicans will ask the minimal wage to be lowered & people to `` volunteer for extra work '' on week ends because free-market-ho and got ta help `` job creators '' while trump is busy gold plating yet another of his private hotels ( with illegal mexicans like usual of course ) that hypocrisy will be the final nail on the coffin . 
  same thing with tolerance for lies on vaccinations ( `` anti vaxxers '' ; well flash info kids are now dying of fuckin measles because their parents refuse taking them to a doctor `` because it 's a conspiracy '' ) ; lies on the climate change ( denial of it ) ; lies tolerance on healthcare ( `` private healthcare is sufficient for everyone ! '', 
  is a very blatant lie ; but-muh profit and too bad for all the vets dying in the streets without any healtcare i guess ? 
  ) ; lies on blamming it all on the mexicans , lies ... 
   they are not illegal . 
  the moment you accept that you accept de facto the next loophole they will find and therefore in the end the fact that they 'll never pay taxes ( because they 'll always find new `` loopholes '' ; they have entire accounting staffs dedicated for that ) and that therefore state-backed education and healthcare will soon be reserved to the wealthy that can afford `` for profit '' options ; for the lack of public tax funded ones . 
  because , if you remove chunks of 1 billion euros per big company per year from the tax budget , this is what is going to happen . 
  say hello to for profit higher education billed 20 000 $ / year by oligarchs like in america i guess ? 
   but at the moment - i would n't and could not call it fraud . 
  920\u00a0000\u00a0000 $ of tax money are still missing from basf and you do n't call this fraud ? 
  damn , i do n't know what it takes for people to identify corruption, 
  when you bribe your way into creating a loophole or keeping it open it 's fraud ; and certainly corruption .
