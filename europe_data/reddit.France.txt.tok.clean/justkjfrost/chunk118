  and you presenting it as a `` geographical fact '' is exactly what i meant by geocentrism :p we all pretend we 're `` the center of the known world '' ...

   how is he still in power ? 
  because in reality he has 20-25 % approval and 20-30 % ambivalent ; and the opposition is blatantly twisting and faking/exagerating polls ( because elections are controled against fraud ; but anybody with 50 $ can make up a random dubious poll and dishonest press article and try to use it to manufacture/influence opinion ) to try to make him look like louis xvi ( the last king before the revolution ) arguing that ( of couuuurse ) they have ( supposedly ) the solution ( more radical neoliberalism ? 
  ^ ^ ^ / s ) it 's just political poo flinging before the elections . 
  that can probably be ignored, 
  one could argue that the gmt is put there due to euro geocentrism haha, 
  one thing i noted when i grew up and traveled a bit is that people in various countries always put their country at the center of their geography world map to hang on the walls , ha , 
  shake my head , if true it only makes the ukrainians hate them more, 
  we can always pass it after they left . 
  \\ - this whole plan sounds like good news to me to reduce fraud & fiscal havens  the mere enforcement of normal tax policies accross most of the eu should give countries a breath of oxygen on reducing deficits & running policy ( less fraud = more tax money collected = more money for governments = they are in a better position ) companies gain money on the simplification of the process across the eu too . 
  facepalm :d because obviously the russian economy is dozens of times stronger than the poor eurozone :d i still think that russia should have took that seat in bruxelles and joigned us instead of going for independant rivalry and invading ukraine : x oh well , maybe one day when passions will have cooled down, 
   frontex issued a swift denial , and the eu 's foreign policy representative , federica mogherini , said no european official had been onboard . 
   `` no #eu officials involved in plane crash in #malta . 
  the flight was not related to any of the eu activities , '' said mogherini in a tweet . 
  hope it did n't hurt too much for the victim regardless, 
  excellent , such a network will go a decent way to help develop the electric car fleet, 
  annnd more government money reappearing . 
  just my kind of news haha, 
  condoleances . 
  glad they caught the bastard tho . 
  only in ukraine ? 
  hahaha, 
  not really . 
  with massively higher prices in greece , they have similar issues . 
  people ending up homeless or without utilities , etc. 
  say how much is rent in romania ? 
  because in athens a 800 $ / month rent is n't that surprizing . 
  so even if they `` earn twice as much '' , they do n't really are `` richer '' . 
  that 's not counting either the massive unemployment in which case you are n't making anything . 
   brexomars will attempt landing at the opposite side of the planet / s somewhere near new zealand or so i heard :d http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/29/new-zealand-offers-uk-its-top-trade-negotiators-for-post-brexit/, 
  well saying they have `` no government '' is a bit of an exageration tbh . 
  the day to day administration is still present , pm rajoy was n't eaten by a blackhole yet and i believe the parliament is still around ... 
  but i guess saying there 's a power struggle sounds less dramatic :d edit relevant http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/opinion/spain-a-country-with-no-government.html, 
   require currency exchange platforms to increase checks on the identities of people exchanging virtual currencies for real ones and report suspicious transactions . 
  that seems reasonable to me , not blocking use but enforcing current legislation ... you need to show id papers when you open an account at a bank ; so you need to show id papers when registering and opening accounts on an exchange trading with europe . 
   require currency exchange platforms to increase checks on the identities of people exchanging virtual currencies for real ones and report suspicious transactions . 
  uh all exchanges are trading `` virtual '' currency anyway , whether it 's pounds or euros or dollars ; there 's no banknote manipulations anymore . 
  of course aiming toward asking the same transaction safeties we ask from usual currencies would seem somewhat reasonable to me, 
  they need a hella lot more than just some niche tourism ; but anything helps i guess ? 
  it 's likely not sadism but it 's definitely a political point-making at that point, 
  better staying wherever you have a livable job , it 's annoying to find one in europe right now if you have no local knowledge or network/life there already , plus on top of that you must find housing , filling paperwork etc etc. . . 
  if your situation in the us is stable ...  with terrible us maternity leave and healthcare we are considering europe . 
  i hate to say this ; but have you tried getting some insurance to cover for it ? 
  there are a lot more decent offers those last few years, 
  probably one of my biggests concern . 
  i ca n't shake the feeling we simply are failing greece ( economically , socially speaking ), 
  ^ he 's right , it 's an ad poking fun at the famous `` brouillard de londres '' ( fog of london ) as we know it in france , 
   the strategy sets the goal of building poland 's first satellite . 
  that 's actually a realistic first `` big goal '' ; not a mere make-wishing political toss up . 
  it 's reassuring on the seriousness of that proposal . 
  best luck , 
  they did ? 
  this is ~ ~ good ~ ~ excellent news  it 'll go a long way, 
  nice sub design , 
  arg yes removed : x oh well more infos around there :d https://twitter.com/esa_edm, 
   this is simply the technical pov the technical pov is `` if we continue that way , in 10 years , 200 000 people will die in europe at the first common cold because nothing will work anymore because we spent them all on the chickens instead . '', 
   so antibiotic as a preventive measure is neccessary . 
  i 'm pretty sure keeping the bulk of our human population alive has to take priority over keeping the bulk of your chicken coop alive in those conditions just to turn extra profit by craming 5 more every meters . 
  farmers will have to help study a new farming model . 
  not doom everyone by wasting all the antibiotics on keeping chickens alive instead of humans . 
   some of the heaviest users in the world are in europe . 
  we 'll need to ban use on healthy beasts if we want to preserve our antibiotics tho ; despite the ( mild ) economic impact : / for the lack of any better option currently . 
  unless of course specialists know anything better ( but i do n't ) . 
  of course i expect medical companies and their lobbies will be repulsed because they 'll loose billions of euros annually if they ca n't needlessly shoot every last cow with amox on a daily basis . 
  both europe and the usa are some of the bigger farmers with a major share in the world 's economy . 
  if we set a good example in both ; that could start a movement . 
  a bit like with cop21  yes but the problem is that already are so many super resistant bacterias , hence the new antibiotics to address them ; but we should n't squander that second chance, 
  it would still reduce the problem by 99 % in europe which while not enough is still a step in the right direction that we 'd be damned if we did n't took . 
  edit : rumor is there is a handfull of new antibiotics coming in the pipelines ; but if they 're made useless before they even reach the human market because the medical corpos wanted quick billions of $ by feeding it to billions of cows and pigs and chickens ... that 's what 's honestly concerning me the most in that topic . 
  estimated landing on #mars at 14:48 gmt / 16:48 cest oct 19 . 
  ~ ~ https://www.facebook.com/teleorbitgmbh/posts/1273256409386234~~ edit link now dead ; more info https://twitter.com/esa_edm, 
  it 'll certainly be interesting to see the results of that one, 
  more serious article than the other and without the word `` apocalypse '' . 
  but it still a serious problem . 
  we could use banning the use of antibiotics on healthy animals . 
  a `` simple '' measure that could save us 5-6 figs of death worldwide at the next pandemic . 
  wait did n't we banned the use of antibiotics on healthy animals in europe ? 
  if not we need to , this is a potentially very big problem because it could make useless in record time ( couple years ) whatever new antibiotics we 'll come up with ; which will only make futur pandemics worse . 
  edit ** we could really use a blanket ban of antibiotics medication of healthy animals in the eu before it becomes another drama crisis with plenty of dead : / ** edit it seems to me we do https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antibiotic_use_in_livestock#european_union but apparently the guardian , a possibly more serious newspaper , suggest in that article that the use is still widespread : / https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/17/use-of-strongest-antibiotics-rises-to-record-levels-on-european-farms edit long story short ; for those that do n't understand ; the more an antibiotic is used , the more sicknesses become resistant to an antibiotics ( which mean the medicament stop working or having any effects on that sickness and is useless ) . 
  in normal use it takes many decades or even centuries ; but if you feed dozens of millions of healthy animals antibiotics by the litteral tons in the daily food without reasons apart being to lazy to check up every animals once in a while ... 
  it reduces the delay to * a few years * . 
  that could leave us with pandemics and no medicaments working on them . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12975693 https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/22/almost-too-late-fears-of-global-superbug-crisis-in-wake-of-antibiotic-misuse http://www.dw.com/en/us-warns-of-nearly-invincible-superbug/a-19285450 remember sars and ebola ? 
  it could turn that bad . 
   for instance , sales of fluoroquinolones -- the newest versions of which are used to treat life-threatening illnesses including pneumonia and legionnaire 's disease -- stood at 141 tonnes across the countries surveyed in 2013 , and rose to 172 tonnes in 2014 . one might almost suspect that the antibiotics manufacturers are complicit because they 'd rather turn an immediate quick profit by selling many tons to farmers now even if that make the meds useless for everyone else when needed later ... of course many will claim `` it 's oppressive regulations '' but what 's the fucking point of edit relevant ? 
  not true , i heard monaco has a glorious 255 man strong army independant of france and andorra a 600-strong part time militia !, 
   the defendants obtained total eu funds of over ron 1.35 million ( some eur 300,000 ) nice find haha, 
   its fake , reporter fired . 
  http://www.amna.gr/article-pagination.php?id=127846 that would explain it ; thank you . 
  could n't find any independant confirmation and i thought it was strange, 
  i will suspect this is a translation mistake and/or the newspaper twisting things ? 
  because , if his idea is to take over part of the european union , i take it that most european capitals will likely be against it . 
  i was wondering for a moment how the hell you could `` loose '' 50 warplanes haha, 
  hey that actually looks nice !, 
  added to my tourism-to-do-one-day list :d, 
   mihaela is now living with her baby daughter , who was fathered by her last trafficker , in romania 's only emergency shelter for trafficked women . 
  well if they want to make arrests they know where to start . 
  nice job uk tho !, 
  ( no sarcasm ),
