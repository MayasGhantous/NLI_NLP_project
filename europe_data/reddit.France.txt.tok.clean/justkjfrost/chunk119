  good , 
   will the box contain an european passport ? 
  then they 'd have to age-test all those illegal english ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ migrants :d, 
  inspired by finland ? 
  worked well there , 
  fascinating post ; thank you  looking at projected gdp growth it just does not seem worth the risk especially if the wealth only ends up in the hand of a few already wealthy industrialists and does not benefit the country . 
   i just ca n't really quantify how much the eu exposes itself to lawsuits from corporations with this trade agreement , the isds clauses being hijacked to siphon vast sums of money certainly are a big concern of many ; especially after that shoddy attempt in romania ( the poorest eu country , that did n't look well ) so we know it 's a real risk because they tried earlier ( with micula where they got hold of 250 millions )  we can not be one of the few who stand against this because at the start of the negotiations we approved the outline of this agreement good point . 
  if that makes you feel any better , i heard that the french government was opposed to isds including agreements tho : http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/france-may-block-eu-canada-trade-deal-over-isds/ now that article is n't brand new , but depending on the turn of events ... and i would suspect that the austrian gov can probably get hold of the french one and ask them if it 's still possible depending on their decision on the matter . 
   i hope it does n't take an hour to read . 
  only 15 minutes , no worries , 
  nah there is nothing linked to it on either side , it 's just an interesting cultural & engineering relic by now . 
  but a couple centuries ago it did showed big time the colossal loss of knowledge and infrastructure in the medieval era , a symbole not even king louis xiv could ignore . 
  admittedly ours got repaired several times over the last few centuries :p, 
  meh , it 's a nice change between two brexit and 3 immigration topics, 
  that explains why it 's close to iceland and it 's own eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull \\* on the map :d \\* ^ ( thanks wiki for the name ), 
   change for the sake of change has become their fetish i disagree . 
  not really . 
  westard , most commoners ( possibly not in germany but in other countries like the uk or france or the us sure are ) are tired of the statut quo impoverishing them perpetually and look up for ways to break it and get away from it . 
  sometimes violently ( the somewhat failed arab spring comes to mind ) , sometimes peacefully ( by voting ) . 
  of course then some tries to exploit that possibility ( like trump ) . 
   it is remarkable how all too often politicians of the moderate centre in comparison to them come across as listless , unwilling to fight , with no faith in their own convictions that 's probably because `` more of the same '' where people can barely meet ends and pay bills is not what people want . 
   i categorically reject this fatalistic approach . 
  i categorically reject this temptation to give in to these trends . 
  interesting turn tho . 
   when it comes to migration , i 'm not going to touch that subject here and now  an eu which does not have the tools to defend itself against trade hooligans will not build support for free trade , which will lead to europe ultimately dropping out of global competition . 
  an interesting take . 
  altho i 'm acuitely aware that such trade danger comes as much from unbrindled concurrency from cheaper countries ; than it comes from robber barons currently making a comeback at home in occident . 
   either we demonstrate that we are able to defend our interests , or the political winners will again be the populists and isolationists . 
  he 's right ... edit : with that post on the right topic it 's better, 
  \\* popcorn \\* i 'm gon na have to read that book, 
  not helping, 
   the brutal truth is that brexit will be a loss for all of us . 
  there will be no cakes on the table for anyone . 
  there will only be salt and vinegar . 
  that said , that 's true . 
  it 's a ( policy ) divorce , which is rarely a happy thing, 
  i agree with you on that . 
  what i want to say is it 's what they ask for in the case for brexit . 
  now , obviously a lot of people , like tusk , said `` no no no no no . '', 
  and i think they ( bruxelles ) are waiting for official on record negociations ( ie end of month of mars 2017 ) before considering anything . 
  edit : of course the brexiters then argue that not being able to close the border to the eu is a violation of their sovereignty and right as a country ; which is an argument you might have heard several times under david cameron . 
  hence why so many wanted to leave to `` recover control of their country '' from the evil claws of people like me that want to deny them their right to seal the border, 
   are you seriously citing the express in your argument ? 
  the lowest of the low in tabloid newspapers , just like the sun . 
  yet , [ when the sun goes one way ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jun/14/the-suns-brexit-call-is-unsurprising-but-it-has-symbolic-significance ) , i 've heard estimated that +20 % of the voters follow that way . 
  yes they 're out of mind , but if they say `` it 's all the poles fault !, 
  '' ; then people start attacking poles in the streets . 
   what does this even have to do with your earlier claim about what the government thinks in secret because the english media kings ( who incidently have a huge overlap with us republican neocons ) are heavily influencing brexit policy but do n't dare say it out loud in public . 
  smokes & mirrors is the damn rule with them, 
  okay so . 
  let 's pick a random english tabloid . 
  1 ... 2 . .3 ... 4 ... let 's say the express !, 
  let 's type `` express immigration '' . 
  annnnd http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/688834/theresa-may-stop-migrant-crisis-pm-vows-end-free-movement-eu edit and let 's not pretend it 's about the wave of illegals/refugees/migrants ; because none of them make it to england from france basically ( they 're blocked in calais hence the refugee city there ) ( maybe a couple a week manage to sneak in past the guards but that 's about it ; there 's a small army of cops blocking illegal passage to the uk in calais ) . 
  no no this is about the eastern european coming legally ( brrr ) to england and that they ( brrr ) have to see in the streets . 
  hence all the recent attacks against them btw . 
   i believe a politician already said the uk has zero friends . 
  not entirely truth . 
  they have plenty of friends in the republican party in the usa . 
  that said , i do n't know whether they would financially bail them out . 
  suit yourself, 
  maybe i do n't want to doxx who i am irl ? 
  but i do have an interest in the eu affairs, 
   it says `` restricting eu labour migration to britain to the 70 % who already have a job lined '' because that 's what they say in public . 
  while in private they want really a complete block , since david cameron ( i do n't know may 's position but the brexiters who want a hard brexit want litterally a sealed borders to all `` dirty immigrants , especially the poles '' ) hence ( partly why ) bruxelle 's dead refusal of secret informal talks ; and that we 're waiting for on records official a50 talks where they ca n't do that double speech game . 
   no one in that picture is in the uk gov. 
  i see you have a mexico flair . 
  so i 'll say `` no one in los zetas was in the government '' . 
  but they 're pretty hard to ignore . 
  and so is he . 
   no one in that picture is in the uk gov. 
  yet boris johnson , who is basically the foreign minister , has an identical line to him . 
   where did boris johnson say brits can `` go where they want but eu citizens are banned from the uk '' ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/working-eu-uk-free-movement-permit-easy-entry-migrants-jobs-automatic-rights - they want to block out europeans coming in ( `` legal migrants '' ) ; but they want to stay in the free market to allow their citizens to go work in the eu . 
  aka one way circulation . 
  well the line is very blurry in reality . 
  for example officially rupert murdoch is just a media mogul with zero position in the governement . 
  but if you pay attention you can see his fingerprints over a ton of things and that he de facto owns or somewhat control probably half the media in the country , and he get to make phonecalls [ and hang out with the russian mafia and farage ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/07/03/farage-murdoch-xlarge_trans++jdhzoku5ccgala2fvvreecqaql0ia9uido53pqqfgfs.jpg ) ( who might as well be called mr brexit ) . 
  yeah some of the brexiters ' demand have been a bit `` out there '' ; probably causing tusk 's reaction in the first place . 
  and why they uk prefered [ informal discussions ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-resists-british-calls-for-informal-talks-on-brexit-and-trade-2016-9?r=uk&amp;ir=t&amp;ir=t ) where they could throw off any ideas and vastly exagerated demands like that to bruxelles then deny in public ever proposing it in the first place ( which caused bruxelles to reject such talks ) . 
  but we 're probably going to wait out the official `` on-paper '' on record offers/negociations in mars before deciding in reality . 
  well we did build completeley independant naval supply chain because we had a need for being able to produce autonomously our own custom naval gear as needed . 
  but admittedly we do have some common cooperative experience producing warships ( including modern ones like aquitaine/bergamini ) so maybe we could build some sort of cooperative company between both countries like airbus yeah . 
  unifying part of our supply chains already at european levels would also simplify requisition and keep reducing costs . 
  so after the failure of the polish deal ; that seems a good idea to me to recoup some of our losses ( and then some more ) over the next decade or two !, 
  i think there is a bit of posturing in that in reality tbh . 
  i would n't put things as `` impossible '' before the nego even started . 
  we should probably let the uk figure out their own position and demands before we decide whether to block refuse or not their demands . 
  obviously the `` a la carte market approach '' of bj ( where they get all the advantages and go where they want but eu citizens are banned from the uk and the eu pay 100m per week the uk ) is n't likely to pass ; but maybe some other demands might albeit admittedly the `` hard brexit '' is a serious possibility at that point ( even if i still think it 's going to sucker-punch the uk 's economy in half along with their currency : / ), 
  that would be spitting in the voter 's face to do that at that point : / what they could do is a `` soft '' brexit tho ( negociating to stay in the eea ) ; it 's , in my humble opinion their second best option ( the real first one since `` non brexit '' is not really an option ) . 
  so i think preping for the mars 2017 brexit negociations is probably for the best , at bruxelle 's level . 
  hopefully the uk 's brexit ministries will have worked out the kinks out of some sort of nego plan on their side too by then ( i 'm using the negociations timeframe suggested by theresa may ), 
  [ for all we know maybe they plot to replace the uk :d ] ( http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_pictures/grail/large/holygrail067.jpg ), 
  charming . 
  what with all the more extreme religious brands promising hellfire to everyone under various pretenses . 
  beyond that it looks like he killed himself when he realized he led himself in a dead end so to speak . 
  ( currently i do n't know anything indicating fool play ) . 
  guy had already stopped eating , talking , and basically mentally crashed in the last few days, 
   you seem to be experiencing bizarre delusions . 
  well it 's funny because the same people that created saudi arabia as it is back poland 's pis and it start spouting similar religious nutcase bullshit  equate to the killing of humans repeating a lie does not make it truth .
