  besides ukraine 's on the defensive , which helps . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  countries at war , during the war  just send financial aid to support them in neighbouring countries turkey , lebanon , jordan , egypt all have already several millions or hundreds of thousands refugees , they physically ca n't take more . 
  i do n't think legalizing temporarily a few thousands already hiding here either way are going to make much of a difference . 
  unless you suggest sending back civis to the syrian front line before the war ends , which is a death sentance . 
  the moment that war is over however and the country stabilized , i agree with you and we should even send them back ( maybe with a bit of help to rebuild ) . 
  short term if you want the problem stopped however , we 'll probably need a diplomatic settlement to the war or a massive ( international ? 
  peace keeping mission there . 
  that 's something we ought to try for actual touristic attractions in europe one day , tank back tourism haha . 
  it 's likely a `` controled release '' ( fakely accidental leak to half admit ) . 
  real casualties ( injured ; 'cause i do n't know for sure about definitely dead ) are higher than that . 
   who could say economic war is not a regular war ? 
  people die of it . 
  because those under `` economic war '' do n't get litterally air striked by assad , kidnapped by al quaeda & family members beheaded by daesh every two days . 
  they do . 
  they just ca n't take all of them ( neither can/should we ) . 
  it 's a bit of a collective effort , really . 
   `` we ca n't have three or four countries bearing the entire burden , '' she said . 
  `` whoever is not being persecuted , whoever does n't come from a country wracked by civil war -- we ca n't act as if he can stay . '' that 's seems pretty reasonable . 
  helping those fleeing a war that are here either way but sending back / refusing ( unskilled ) economic migrants . 
  i can respect that . 
  immigrants are going to come in illegally regardless . 
  soooo , if they risk jail for working ( which is kind of unavoidable if you want to eat & pay the rent ) , what are they going to do ? 
  they 'll do work that bring in maximum profit for the same jail risk : drugs , stealing , ... cracking down on the employer instead is probably more efficient . 
  that is certainly true . 
  relevant : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chewbacca_defense, 
  do you have any source ? 
  i 'm sure it 'd would interest a lot of people . 
   i was talking about oil prices leading to recessions uh . 
  i would n't worry too much about scandinavia ; they have de facto * the richest average lifestyle on earth * for it 's inhabitants ; ok * maybe * behind south korea and japan in the 90 's . 
   scandinavian countries are aiding the secret prisons . 
  were . 
  afaik we closed those that were found in europe . 
  and please do n't lecture me on history or i 'll refer you to wikipedia on stalin 's gulags . 
   im not disagreeing that its a crime , but whats the next step ? 
  maintaining sanctions , i guess . 
   by your logic , norwegians , saudis , canadians , finns , uzbeks are being punished too . 
  what are those country have anything to do with ??? 
  saudis maybe , but wake me up when scandinavians are running a gitmo . 
  hell they can barely keep actual criminals in normal prison , let alone non violent convicts . 
   the issue is that this is a violation of international law on paper , but since the us that has nothing to do with the usa , china or even fucking zimbabwe . 
  you are kidnapping ukrainians , and that will definitely not help if you want sanctions removed . 
   so no one will punish russia 1 $ = 85 rub next week . 
   even france has secret military courts since degaul times . 
  nice invention , bro . 
  \\  russia kidnapping people \\  letsblametheusa russian logic never cease to surprise me . 
  yeah i distinctly remember hearing the words '' concentration camp '' fly a couple times on the topic . 
  it might be an exageration but we probably do n't want to routinely beat to death people in shady circumstances . 
  good , we definitely need more people like them in our society, 
  in that case i 'd answer them not controling their own border and smuggling citizens to our own land is an `` act of war '' too . 
  and simply promptly ignore their powerless gov either way since they lost tripoli to jihadis . 
  do smile for the drone cam !, 
  good , now turn them back to libya : /, 
  the problem is we do n't always know their country of origin . 
  and we ca n't afford an inquiry for every single immigrant . 
  great way to get deported to turkey . 
  got to admit , nice job marines  edit : apparently they were ng & air force ; nice job all the same !, 
   so , you actually believe that `` austerity '' even took the fishes away from greek fishermen . 
  no , it took most of their client 's revenue away , then their boat . 
   maybe someone should warn the people who spent the last decades warning about the hazards of overfishing it 's funny that the `` hazard of overfishing '' are suddenly an issue just when the country is bankrupting ( but not in germany who fish twice as much apparently ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fishing_industry_by_country ) . 
  some might draw comparison to russia 's sudden `` major sanitary concern '' that push them to destroy on sight any and all food coming from the eu currently . 
  or also when you find out that the `` bloated greek public apparatus '' is curiously [ sold to german companies in priority ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/19/germans-to-run-greek-regional-airports-in-first-wave-of-bailout-privatisations ) , like the airports . 
  should i actually look into who owns stock in said airport companies ? 
  sniff sniff , do i smell german hypocrisy & bullying ? 
   ... says a person from the one country who browbeat germany into the euro hey if we go about wwii stuff i 'll say `` but the nazis '' . 
  really . 
   and whose press triumphantly declared a `` versailles treaty of modern times '' just because we f ** ed up during the cold war is n't a pass for germany to starve greece to death . 
   if you 're so generous why is n't your country opening its money spigots for greece ? 
  last i heard we gave several billions to the country , actually . 
  but they owe more money to germany than us , sorry . 
  here 's who they owe money to ( in b of $ ) : http://static.franceculture.fr/sites/default/files/imagecache/ressource_full/2015/01/29/4993653/bilat%c3%a9raux.png ( courtesy of http://www.franceculture.fr/2015-07-27-tout-comprendre-sur-la-dette-grecque-en-six-etapes ), 
  i did . 
  but at the moment the lack of any income if they mass sell their boats seems a bigger problem to me than overfishing . 
  improving what ? 
  reality is there is still nobody with money left to buy any fish and the others still wo n't see their unlivable debt relieved since germany excluded that much and would rather the entire country and every last greek bank go bankrupt . 
  no but germany is certainly responsible for enforcing '' austerity '' with that versaille treaty of an agrement and refusal to loose a single euro on their failed gambles that is destroying the entire economy . 
  fof the fishing industry to be viable you need fishermen with boats too . 
  and what do you think the fisherman will do with the money ? 
  use it to pay late bills and debts because the lack of go assistance ( cut to pay germany back more , '' austerity '' they call it ) makes it unviable . 
  inevitably it all goes back to the greek bank who the use it to pay germany . 
  see . 
  when the fisherman sell his boat to pay up his bills , he 'll kindah be in trouble because he just sold his only living . 
  foreign creditors certainly got a lot more back than they sunk in over time . 
  multiple times . 
  to follow your analogy , so now you remove the grass ( their fishing boats . ), 
  and sell it to make more immediate money ( `` pay debts now or else . 
  '' ) , and you wonder why the sheep starve to death when there is no more grass left . 
   a few years ago , he stopped bringing in sole and snapper . 
  they were too expensive for greeks . 
  `` this year is awful , '' he says . 
  `` people can not buy . ''  he has applied to the eu program that buys boats and is waiting for approval to come . 
  `` if it does , '' he says , `` that boat will be scrapped . '' you know the saying , you can sheer a sheep as much as you want , but you can only skin it once . 
  i believe germany did just that . 
   another site , wiadomosci walbrzyskie , said ( in polish ) the train was 150m long and may have up to 300 tonnes of gold on board . 
  here it says it 's worth 33 millions per ton : http://onlygold.com/info/value-of-gold.asp so if their estimation is good , the whole thing is probably worth about 10 billions usd . 
  truly christmas for poland . 
   land development is core to sustaining an economy if your `` sustained economy '' is based on taking away half of everyone 's income countrywide straight to give it to a few oligarchs that own all the land , maybe your `` economy '' is shit too . 
   the fact of the matter is that the nordic welfare system is n't sustainable in its current form .
