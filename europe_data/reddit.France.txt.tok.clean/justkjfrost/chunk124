  you 're not `` the biggest client in europe '' anymore if you ca n't have any european client anymore . 
  ( because that 's exactly what `` passporting '' means ; the right to offer financial business in the eu market ) . 
  i mean what they are saying makes little sense to me . 
  nah no point at that stage just for a few insults by the filipino drunk-in-charge because the fallout would only be felt by the commoners ; not the leadership . 
  well you killed some of our citizens in your bloody drug war so fuck you too . 
  facepalm, 
   and you can have another referendum i 'm not english i 'm on the other side of the channel , but that 'd be bad imho because that would very much ring like `` we did n't liked the way you voted last time so you voted wrong and will have to vote again '' . 
   yes it can be voted on in parliament after an election mayyybe ( provided mps of both parties do n't hide what they 'll vote ) . 
  without another election , as in , now , people would yell it 's rigged . 
  as much as i hate to say it , he 's partly right : the citizens democratically voted in favor of brexit and now we ca n't exactly deny them that much . 
  ergo the best we can do is look up how to damage control the situation . 
  it 's still a terrible idea , but do we have any choice really ? 
  well apart the bit where they would risk not getting financial passporting rights ( no clearance , no insurances etc from london anymore ) & extra tariffs on top i guess . 
  great news !, 
  maybe finally some of those companies will pay their fair share to society . 
  basically no big companies where paying any taxes . 
  that was very much the core of the problem , yes . 
  erh . 
  okay they got brexit but maybe the brexiters should , i dunno , let their own people finish attempts at negociations at least ? 
  oo if they do n't their economy would actually implode from the shock . 
  that 'd be a bad call to sacrifice their country 's wealth and power because they could n't wait a year or two for the details to be fully hammered out is n't it ? 
  oo ( the kind of time frame i 'd expect for the whole story to be over at least on the a50 side and officially out honestly ) that 's like burning down your part of the house because you feel angry the divorce paperwork details were n't already finished 2 days ago . 
  since , you know , this is unprecedented in the legal history of the area and the brexiters had no plan of their own , like every trade negociations it 's going to take a bit of time typically counted in months or maybe a year or two to figure out how everything works .

  1 d 14 i ( 2 serious ), 
  that 's almost like one might suspect them to do obstructionism for the sake of being annoying on something that does n't even concern them anymore . 
  fair enough . 
  that does ring somewhat true, 
  looks like the islamists are getting full retard simultaneously . 
  ( i ca n't wait for the apologists to explain why their religion is totally right to attack random people in the streets ), 
  charge at night , or half charge in 10min at a station if you are in a hurry and forgot to do it for a week commuting is what , 20km top a day ? 
  out of hundreds of km of range . 
  which is why we should target new car sales to switch for full elec. 
  trying to take everyone 's old beater would never work ; but let them simply fall apart over the next decades ( most cars do n't seem to live for more than 20/30y ... ) and take car that new cars sold on the market are all elec and it 'll work . 
  good initiative , 
  well well well . 
  meanwhile they 're framing cameron for iraq/isis . 
  ah yes . 
  let 's not forget about the scapegoat that was already getting pointed out before cameron was ; namely the polish immigrants . 
  hundreds of billions stolen on a routine basis , but somehow it 's the polish immigrants ' 200 $ of child welfare that is supposedly ruining the country . 
  look at all those conservative people covering their own arses with finger pointing at cameron . 
  did they mentionned that if they had n't stolen 3/4 of the reconstruction budget that collapse might have not been half that bad ? 
  as to blame cameron for isis , sorry but `` lol '' . 
  if `` debaathification '' ( ie immediate firing of the entire iraqi army and government workers , and putting them all to a job blacklist for life ) had n't happened , isis would never had existed because their would never have been tens of thousands of disenfranchised ex saddam soldiers armed to the teeth and banned from jobs for life . 
  and that 's not even counting ( once again ) the extreme corruption of the rebuilding process in iraq which meant 3/4 of the money was stolen there once again resulting in the country falling to a corrupt thirdworld hellhole level . 
  and all that happened decades before cameron . 
  so if you intend to start kangaroo court trials with the only people that were n't radical neoliberals ; please explains first : https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3qj888/500_billion_dollars_stolen_under_maliki_rule_in/ http://nationalinterest.org/feature/corruption-iraq-where-did-all-the-money-go-16279 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/iraq-reconstruction_n_2819899.html http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/the-failed-reconstruction-of-iraq/274041/ https://www.ft.com/content/590ca818-f7f5-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d iraq was systematically destroyed partly with the complicity of the tony blair government due to a mix of incompetence and extreme corruption nobody tried to fight because it was easier to ask for your own cut from the mafia . 
  this is what created isis . 
  a failed , invaded dominated country with mafiosis in charge , western politician turned gangsters looting the country in the name of `` the hand of the freemarket will liberate all ! '', 
  and where the only remaining way to have an income for a large part of the population was joigning a violent armed gang . 
  but i guess blamming the guy that turned up 10 years later is easier ? 
  sorry i edited my last post . 
  please account for the cost of life . 
  in western europe you need basically triple the amount you pay in the baltics to get the same lifestyle . 
   ukraine is unfortunately going down not up , that is temporary due to the war & some of the more extreme measures they had to take as a result ( printing inflation , borrowal , displacement of the gold stock , light partial draft , reconverted factories , ... ) . 
  they are forced to make do without their old rust belt industry now all in the hands of the russians , and there are many internally displaced citizens ; so that will hurt a lot for like 5-10 years ( new housing & economy to rebuild for a million citizen or two , the industry has to relocate away from the front , reinvestments to make , all the supply chains had to be rebuilt from scratch , etc ) then they should recover . 
  but the actual economy of western areas like lviv modernized a lot . 
   why would ukraine be at the level of lithuania ? 
  ukraine is rising , lithuania stagnated a lot : /  and poland with ireland ? 
  ireland went down the drain for a time because the neoliberals decided that they prefered taking bribes , embezzling money like no tomorrow , stealing utilities money , and stopped collecting taxes ( and ran nearly the entire budget on borrowing instead ) and did not believed in retirement for it 's working population etc. 
  a bit like the uk before but a lot more extreme . 
  poland on the contrary had tons of money properly invested and the economy there skyrocketed recently . 
   which macro-economic indicators are you considering when building this scale ? 
  gdp per capita , lifestyle level of it 's citizen . 
  please also note in a number of eastern countries life is a lot cheaper . 
  you live a lot poorer with 1500 $ in paris than in the baltics with 900 $ ( renting a flat at 150 $ / mo do n't exist in western europe anymore where it 's more like 900-1200 / month even in a provincial town ) . 
  edit : comparing cost of living with say average estonia ( one of the more developped baltics ) and a big coastal city in france like nantes : http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=france&amp;city=nantes http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=estonia, 
   the association you made seems strange , though . 
  moldova is not in the eu , so not an eu country . 
  nor was romania some time ago . 
  i hope it 'll become an eu country . 
   do you mean `` together with '' as in if they united ? 
  erh we 'll let the moldovan and romanians decide that one  the association seems strange because the gdp per capita of romania is 4.5 x of moldova both are ~ ~ sinistred ~ ~ damaged next to western countries either way  so the association is strange . 
  from the outside i guess erh . 
  but both are eastern european countries at simply various state of economic repair . 
  so i guess you see them as very different but erh . 
  how to put it . 
  there 's a bit of a repair road with economies at various points . 
  it look like africa-grade  moldova/balkans  romania  ukraine/latvia/lithuania  portugal/estonia/greece / ireland/poland ( / russia ? 
  badly damaged economy )  italy/uk/spain  germany/france/finland / norway/sweden ( i did n't list everyone but just tried to point out errhhh `` economic tiers '' ) . 
  as a rough rule of thumb , the further ahead of the list , the more time people worked on those economies , invested etc. 
  the nordics and western having been built ahead since marshall plan & the end of wwii ( eastern europe was under embargo at the time due to stalin being absolutely not friendly to western countries and well let 's face it very bloodthirsty ; so the lack of trade hindered rebuilding there ) . 
  the republic , but a bit both tbh . 
  the area is very poor ( and even ukraine ) and economically depressed . 
   i fail to understand why it matters when politicians in germany and france think a country should or should not join an aspect of the eu . 
  joigning the eu / shengen etc is a concensus thing  we all know there are n't gon na be vetos thrown around for countries that are already member states , so if they meet the criteria , let them join !, 
  that 's the end game . 
  but if we can help them fix their deep economic trouble along the way before they get all the options everyone wins from it . 
  they are currently still with moldova one of the poorest eu country . 
  if they are richer they win because well they are n't as poor , and other eu states drag their feet less because they have less to fear `` the great moldovan-romanian [ job-welfare ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/40/4e/f6/404ef6240b61996fdc89f188f45acaa1.jpg ) stealing invasion \u2122 '' . 
  i would suspect the new airbus factory in brasov is a very good thing in that sense . 
  that 's partly linked to the recent improvements we saw in the country . 
  admittedly , they have been hard working , especially on corruption infrastructure and the economy , to turn their situation around !, 
  but there is still also much work to be done , i hope they wo n't stop right now while there is still inertia to keep improving their country , 
  well , good luck to him, 
  m e m e e m e i too can make shitposts , see ? 
   hmm , what happened in the last 10 years that might effect gdp ? 
  dell leaving . 
  for an eu state with defacto higher tax rates btw ( poland ) . 
   its on the tip of my tongue , i 'm sure it was mentioned in the papers , some global event that disproportionately effected ireland ?
