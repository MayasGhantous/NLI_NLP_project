  xd guess we beat trump to the punch he ? 
   and piled into eu coffers . 
  it 's not ; - the end of the cartel means they have to lower prices means it 's not the eu that 's getting the bulk of the money ; it 's the consumer that do n't have to spend a fortune for it anymore - the money collected by the eu is redistributed in various programs ( whether it 's funding national debts , erasmus programs , administration wages , or the futur eu army programs , development of poland , agricultural subsidies etc ) . 
  that 's what collecting tax money was invented for in the first place . 
  now people might have disagreements on how things are budgeted , but joke apart , it 's not piled in a corner of a room just for a beast to sleep upon ha . 
  that 's more something private individual would tend to do when having a huge sum of money for themselves . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ btw ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ ^ ironic ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ big ^ ^ ^ ^ animal ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ british ^ ^ ^ ^ finance ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ones ^ ^ ^ ^ sleeping ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ treasure, 
  why , you want to pay your next windshield 2000 # instead of 40 # next time you encounter a bolt on the highway because they ran a price fixing artificial monopoly ? 
  this is certainly welcome, 
   the fees proposed by the commission would also be capped at 4 cents per minute , 1 cent per sms and 0.85 cents per mb . 
  assuming this politico.eu webpage is around 15mb , and that surfing to it mean you likely used 100-150mb of surf , you already owe about 2 $ of overfee to the company . 
  now spend an hour of surf and you 'll owe easily already 50 $ . 
  do that a few days without knowing it and it 'll be 500 $ . 
  yep nope still not there . 
  sorry , can we stop enforcing 1970-era internet quotas and fees ? 
  `` by the mb '' quotas is absurd nowadays when an average gif picture is 20mb alone without accounting for the whole website around it . 
   consumers can only `` roam '' for 30 days at a time and only for a total of 90 days in a year we 're not really in an `` eu wide free market '' if i can only use my phone abroad 90 days/year without playing the constant sim card swapping game at every borders again is n't it ? 
  there has to be a way to have an eu wide working 5g that do n't stop working 90d after crossing a border ; and i 'm sure i could do without constantly swapping cards to bypass the issue or give half my income in fees to countless local telecom operators pfft, 
  that seem like proper justice , 
  ... are they 're kindah aware there is no such problem in the eu ( nor an independant uk ) ??? 
  : x we do have countlesss other issues like high level police corruption & political coverups of mps instead , but police brutality on black people is n't a thing neither in the uk nor continental europe . 
  furthermore by screwing with a runaway they 're only endangering more people , regardless of their ethnicities ( plane crashes do n't look at your skin color ) . 
  reneging on your word ? 
  :| that 's not going to do any good to the eu 's economy either . 
   the greek government is also not making much progress with the setup of a planned privatization fund , according brussels insiders . 
  ah yes always more of that extreme right thing that want to cut up what remains of greece and buy scrap of it for pennies . 
  always pushing for more `` privatization '' . 
  well ; skynews talking against blind unmanaged race to brexit ? 
  did the sky fell out when i was n't looking ? 
  this more realistic article is quite welcome coming from them . 
  crude sarcasm apart , they 're making some valid points here . 
  technically , if they remain in the eu free market throught the eea norway-style ( despite leaving the eu proper ) that might not be a problem tho ( since they 'd have to apply relevant eu trade law , which would likely satisfy the bulk of the businesses and industry ) . 
  the point that might stuck tho is that the uk will have to choose whether to follow their dream policy of closing down border on eu passeport holders to lash out at the poles like some so dearly want ( in which case they loose free market access and their citizens ' access to the continent ) ; or whether to remain in the free market throught the eea to maintain their economy ( in which case they ca n't single out eu citizens ) . 
  ( and please , do n't tell me the anti immigration wave is n't about poland ; it 's pretty obvious it 's the case and the press seem to agree : - / https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/28/britains-850000-polish-citizens-face-backlash-after-brexit-vote/ http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/racist-incidents-feared-to-be-linked-to-brexit-result-reported-in-england-and-wales http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36656348 or even the recent murder ) \\ - obviously , as an eu citizen , i would suggest finding a solution to maintain the eu border open ( visa-free ) for people with proper valid paperwork on both sides ( illegal immigration will remain illegal and not allowed throught without proper paperwork obviously ) ; allowing the uk to stay in the eea and benefiting greatly from our market . 
  staying in the eea might also allow the uk to likely keep financial passeporting , which would prevent banking and financial service ( or other industries like japan 's here ) exodus accros the channel . 
  it would also allow english citizen to keep coming unimpeded to the eu or settle the `` hard border '' question with ireland for example . 
  the main `` price '' tho for the uk would be that they 'd have to explain why the polish citizens that come here likely are n't responsible for the crisis , and that attacking them in the streets will not solve the economic problem in any shape of form . 
  but that would also mean newspapers like skynews or the sun ( [ which drove the brexit ] ( http://geopolis.francetvinfo.fr/bureau-londres/files/2016/06/the-sun-brexit-lexpress-e1465901495850.jpeg ) , by [ blaming everything on eu immigrants ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1502632/britain-must-set-out-clear-boundaries-on-immigration-as-we-prepare-to-negotiate-brexit/ ) ) would have to admit that the money missing from the economy is more likely [ due to corporations and billionaires being above taxes ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/apple-owes-145-billion-in-back-taxes-european-authorities/2016/08/30/e7f6ed80-6ea2-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html ) embezzling [ billions per company ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/tax/9652516/foreign-firms-could-owe-uk-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html ) and [ ambiant corruption in the political elite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal ) ( a hard target , since a lot of them are friends with the media 's owners ) ; rather than [ the few hundred euros of welfare some polish people collect ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/9847650/why-are-we-sending-child-benefit-to-poland.html ) ( the easy scapegoat but a false target ) and/or [ some other hoax fantasy about the eu ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/50twnp/suns_imperial_up_yours_to_brussels_falls_down_on/ ) ( another convenient scapegoat for corruption frequently used too ) . 
  good news from and for the eu , 
  i 'm very happy to hear it  it is a landmark case in acting toward ending giant & utterly systematic corporate tax fraud in the multi dozen billion ranges . 
  for occidental countries , corporate taxes is one of the main sources of money that will allow us to keep maintaining the infrastructure and system ( from hospitals to education to utilities ) that made occidental countries the force they are today , and to keep being able to project ourselves in the futur as a superpower instead of a declining empire . 
  as for apple computers i 'm not worried about them , they are many dozens times richer than that ( both the company and it 's owners ) . 
  it is only normal they pay back part of their fair share to the society that made them so rich . 
  i 'm afraid you might find it a bit on the `` work work work '' side of things . 
  only thing left there right now is an old science research station and recruitement is probably as picky as antartica . 
  sure , can we use you as a voluntold beta tester ? 
  for some reasons , i 'm not sure it 's acceptable to toy and ruin emprisoned human lives just because you can . 
  i 'll leave the crass stuff to daesh and some others . 
  i 'm sure the short list can recognize itself < . <, 
  because building in a remote island at the other end of the planet with zero available space , zero infrastructure , no utilities , and where shipping half a kg by the post office costs 200 $ ( and where the closest viable shore is australia at 5000km from it , not counting antartica ) would somehow be cheaper than a refugee camp in continental france ? 
  they 're also known as the `` iles de la d\u00e9solation '' . 
  * desolation islands *, 
  well i guess we can always mass arrest anyone caught on the highway like that or doing other crimes and keep them in a cell till they remember whatever country they came from . 
  if anything that should keep people from repeating that & stop them from brutally disturbing daily life or attacking other trucks . 
  ( because if you make an ambush you make a choice hey . 
  the ppl implicated in that generally are n't victims . ), 
  except turkey is not actually attacking isis but ypg ... bollocks . 
  isis killing muslims , for a change, 
  haha, 
  neither faction does have those . 
  it 's telling that it 's the independant that post this . 
  looks like they 're pushing her character under a bus a couple years after her death ; so that it could n't be used against the tories anymore  the kingdom had been leaning towards a deal with france , until mrs thatcher 's intervention . 
  yuuuuuup . 
  :d `` hey france look how tatcher screwed you over 42b ! '' . 
  it 's blatant scapegoating, 
  well looks like they caught another daeshi from speischer, 
   the us has warned the european commission that it will consider retaliating if brussels goes ahead with plans to demand billions of dollars in unpaid taxes from apple and other us multinational companies . 
  i 'm sorry , does the treasurery really threathen us if we apply our laws in our countries and/or does not allow your corrupt friends to steal european budgets money ? 
   the white paper said the commission 's demand for retroactive tax payments `` sets an undesirable precedent that could lead to other tax authorities , particularly those in developing countries that look to the eu as a model , to seek large and punitive retroactive recoveries from both us and eu companies '' . 
  if you ca n't pay the time , then do n't do the crime . 
   he is islamising the education , forcing women to wear headscarves , advocating polygamy and forced marriages both of which are strictly forbidden in the chechen culture , advocating for islamist laws , have non-legal teams to look after what women are wearing and shooting paintballs to their dresses , advocated for some `` moral identity cards '' and above all , forcibly islamizes the chechen population with the kind of islam in his head . 
  he is a strict islamist , just a non-salafi one and a pro-kremlin one . 
  he is an actual islamist . 
  well , okay . 
  this is bad news then . 
   also has some weird reputation as `` red bearded snipers and berserkers '' like some bigfoot fables . 
  i never heard of anyone actually landing a shot on a real life big foot and taking pictures of it 's papers in cyrilic . 
  texan rednecks would have gone foaming long ago otherwise . 
  sadly jihadis are very real for their own part . 
   ever heard of kadyrov for example ? 
  he 's certainly a muslim and religious , but i 'm not sure whether kadyrov is an actual * islamist * or a bit of a warlord exagerating a bit his own personna on instagram ? 
   there is no salafism tradition in chechnya , they have been existing for a decade or two only . 
  salafism also does n't include female circumcision so nothing related . 
  i do n't know which denomination or branch of islam they worship , but a number of daeshis/nusra/arhar / jaish/whatever burried in northern syria definitly had russian papers and at least several came from chechenya or other caucausus republics/oblasts/whatever . 
   there is no such a huge number . 
  i saw litterally hundred of post mortem cases mentioned ( dead isis & similar jihadis coming from caucausus ) in a short few years . 
  while anecdotale and obviously biased , it 's certainly significant in my eyes . 
   well , it is a new kremlin habit that came with putin administration . 
  are you really telling me you say that putin & his circle are willfully appointing radical islamists in his own administration ? 
   if you 're talking about `` borderline alqaeda-grade fundamentalism '' as jihadism , sure they do n't . 
  if you 're talking about islamism quite frankly i 'm starting to label the whole thing as `` fundamentalist violent islam '' because whether they openly preach jihad or not those radical violent clerics tend to have very similar patterns and mentalities . 
  and i 'm starting to see them as a real danger to our ( well modern ) way of life ( the one from after 1900 , not the one from the dark ages . 
  i 'm sure you would rather have luminaries such as that that enlighted cleric preaching for people to mutilate themselves and each others . 
   chechnya has no such a traidition tell that to all those from there that joigned daesh  he is not from chechnya from one side of the caucasus or another  it 's really interesting how people are accusing chechnya and chechens without having a slightest idea . 
  that probably has something to do with the huge number of islamist fanatic that come from the area  there is also no such a thing as `` accidentally finding himself in some official position '' in russian federation . 
  kremlin is also known for backing various islamists accidentally as in `` not by kremlin decision '' . 
  while oppression , stalinism , rampant theft and suppression are definitely old russian habits , islamism fundamentalism definitely is n't one of those . 
  i would even suspect that key officials are ( always were , but did n't said so before ) actually russian orthodox and do n't really like borderline alqaeda-grade fundamentalism . 
  that look more like a radical from chechenya/nearby it that accidentally himself in some official position on basis of his religious fundamentalistic retardation background, 
  from 16 % .
