   also they naturally want to influence what is being taught and their lifestyle simply doesn \u00b4 t fit the western one . 
  and that 's a problem . 
  because our lifestyle is possibly a huge factor in why our countries are dominant ones nowadays despite having little natural ressources . 
   the bba wants the uk to leave the single market but retain unimpeded access to eu markets they 're aware that does n't exist right ? 
  :p i mean i do n't say that to mock the uk or hurt them , i mean the market membership a binary point in our legislation . 
  it can be independant of in or out of the eu , but if you are out of the eea market well then you are out of it . 
   officials say the talks have revealed a willingness among some top figures to scrap passporting despite early calls to stay in the single market from some quarters . 
  which means then than those companies can either move to europe or lose access to it . 
  well , it 's britain call 's i guess , but if you do n't get passeporting or membership in the market get prepared to loose a couple hundred billions worth of industries that want access to eu markets . 
   the city of london corporation 's policy chief , who attended the meeting last month , said the issue of passporting was key for the treasury . 
  this ^  the bba wants the uk to leave the single market but retain unimpeded access to eu markets . 
  the compromise would give british authorities control over uk regulation while giving eu customers access to the city . 
  which ca n't happen because you are either in or out of the market . 
  not both at once . 
  this is n't a shrodinger membership haha  the so-called norway option would provide greatest continuity for banks and their customers , norway can be a good example , then please understand it is a member of the market . 
  they are in the market . 
   `` being the financial capital of europe and the world 's leading international financial centre without any say over how we are regulated would cause major problems in the future , and could be a threat to financial stability . '' which is why everybody thought the brexit was a terribly bad idea damaging massively the english economy . 
  but then in that case maybe being a market member while keeping something of `` a say over regulations '' should be the point for the uk ? 
  oh for fuck sake we are still stealing wages and not paying people ? 
  pay them !!!, 
  and above minimal wage !, 
  shame on the culprits . 
  shame . 
  there are enough to pay millions of euros for the wages and stuff to very wealthy mps but we ca n't even pay a minimal wage to the thousands that actually run the economy and get stuff done ? 
  this is pathetic and open corruption . 
  this needs to stop , now . 
  edit : as for the mps that are pocketing the wage allowance money and not paying their staff , they need to face justice and jail sentances for fraud . 
  seriously , that `` joke '' has been going for way too long . 
  having an employee on two unpaid is not acceptable . 
  especially not for such rich people , that are stealing the wage of staffers generally the ones doing the governmental job . 
  if officials would rather steal their staffer 's wage then what a good example it must be for the country they are working for . 
  i 'm sure it 's going to do wonder to society / s. 
  generally if it 's leaking one drop per day i 'd look why the bucket is n't filled in the first place and why there is no water to go in it ( political embezzlement in the dozens of billions range ) rather than look at the drop loss constantly . 
  ... so much propaganda , it 's starting to show a bit at that point ... ( gta iv is a very popular video game with many millions players . 
  and that paper is only showing hidden tricks to get lots of items and everything else in the game . 
  it 's litterally like showing somebody has a xbox and call of duty and say it 's a proof that it 's owner was `` member of al qaeda '' . 
  facepalm . ), 
   there were such rumours , but they are doing something easier - they just fake documents . 
  there was this `` funny '' case where whole ghetto was full with children with asthma ( faked medical documents ) , so they could get extra benefits . 
  sounds like greece with the fake blindness epidemy : http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052970203370604577263863362854348 the way you fight this is by cracking down on corruption . 
  not by suspending everyone earning it legit ( because fakers will just find other schemes otherwise ), 
   as far as i know , if eu citizen wants welfare benefits from an another eu country , he must first work there certain amount of time . 
  this makes it a bit unlikely that there were large amount of balkan gypsies living on welfare benefits in germany ... ^ important bit . 
  let 's not fall for murdochs ' `` all the foreigners are lazy invaders stealing our welfare money and jobs '' if they paid the insurance x years while working just like everyone else , i do n't see why they should be denied unemployment coverage, 
  next to how many that work ? 
  and how many germans living on welfare ? 
  it 's a drop in the bucket, 
  has the money been paid off ? 
  if so we can do that bit already i suspect otherwise errrh how about talking to morrocco . 
  nice sunni ( and sunny ) place , muslim majority too and maybe we can fund them into accepting refugee camps too ? 
  lots of empty space in their desert too so it can be used to build more ( not necessarily isolated & far away , but they do n't lack empty space ) . 
  medditeranean climate too & close enough from europe to send people there, 
  yeah that would be plain wrong on my part haha, 
  sorry , my post was confuse due to written too quickly . 
  big picture , the lafayette was pretty much a `` stealth warship '' test run leading to the fremm 's engineering . 
   and 3 fremms . 
  a couple more will join that number : auvergne , bretagne , normandie , alsace , lorraine . 
  maybe ( or maybe not ) more depending on the fleet 's needs after that . . albeit since we 're in peace times we can take our time and crank one every couple years instead of doing it like the americans and spawn 10 ship per year . 
  of course if we do end up in an horrible wwiii , we can start mass producing them . 
  ( besides how can we play the bond villains without a fleet of [ stealth ships ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/jamesbond/images/5/5c/stealth_boat_model.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20121017195022 ) o :-), 
   it 's a separate matter from gulen . 
   he also said turkey had sent germany more than 4,000 files on what he said were wanted terrorists , but the country did nothing . 
  well obviously not . 
  and no we 're not handing him over people to disappear . 
  especially not 4000 of them . 
  especially not after wwii , especially not after the massive abuse under the dreaded rendition system or the shit that happened in eastern europe similarly . 
  we did n't dismantled those secret arrest systems and shown the door to the `` homeland security anti terrorism agency '' and '' \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0301\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0301\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 '' to let erdogan do just the same . 
  `` this frigate '' ? 
  the fremm is a * class * , we have a number of stealth ships, 
  you 'd read the sun you 'd think we 'd be or bruxelle 's already doing it on a weekly basis :d, 
   erdogan blames ` foreign powers ' for coup and says west is supporting terrorism so if we do n't let you start a maidan in germany ( a country which by most standards is decent to live in ; and certainly not worth a revolution ) by simply removing the giant public display enticing to violence , it 's `` terrorism '' ? 
  i also find it kind of ironic that turkey baselessly accuses us to `` support gullen '' ( which is blatantly false and ridiculous ) then imitate gullen and act identically in germany starting it 's own parrallele `` turkish network '' and giant `` protests '' in an european country . 
  that 's doing just what you falsely accused us of . 
  the articles you provide have probably at least somewhat incoherent numbers . 
  quoting for example :  in germany , the average pension in 2013 was 760.43 euro , with supplementary pensions provided by employers . 
  in 2011 -- since there are no recent figures -- the average combined pension was 1,576 euros for men and 1,302 for women in the western part of germany , while in the eastern part the average pension was 1,303 euros and 1,219 euros respectively . 
  i do not now know how they get from a 1576 $ & 1302 $ to an older 760.43 $ `` average '' number while saying they do n't have any more recent numbers ( well then where that 1576 came from ? ) . 
   and prior too the crisis the average retirement age was 57 . 
  that number was likely cooked in the books along with the rest of the statistics released by pasok . 
  the fact that it `` magically '' rose to 65 just the next year after when book became uncooked , even in your link , without any greek citizen complaining about that , is very revealing . 
  what i suggest is that i suspect that officially pension age was probably lower because they ( pasok politicians ) were `` simply '' putting `` ghost '' pensioners in the books that did n't exist in reality , so they could lead astray vast amounts of pension money to supposedly pay pensioners , but really to give the money to themselves . 
  it 's a trick i saw happen a lot in iraqi with `` ghost soldiers '' that was draining like 10 % of their state budget . 
  correcting that was needed , but cutting pension to actual pensionners and forcing them to work past 60 + was just plain old gratuitous in my sense . 
   in and thereby becoming a transfer union and not changing anything about the greek deficit ? 
  a cash transfert union will be needed to correct the imbalances of the eurozone if we persist in banning states to print out any needed currency . 
  currently , trade ( im ) balances means that the euro pool is slowly transfered year after years from all the southern deficit states ( italy , greece , spain , portugal , ... ) toward the northern industrially producing ones . 
  since they are neither autorized to print more , nor borrow more , that inflation ( / deflation ) is pegged accross the entire zone and therefore ca n't vary more than a couple percent a year ; and that now on top of that we force them to pay massive amounts of suspicious debts , it can only means that the currency pool in southern countries is simply in free fall ; where euros all goes away north and never come back . 
  at that rate it means there 'll be a point where all the euros will simply be out of the country , which is what happened when the greek banks bankrupted ; despite currency controls . 
  so , yes , either there will be a need for transfert union , or to let them print some euros to make up for the trade balance . 
  or there will be a need to enforce anti surplus rules on germany via multi billions penalties transferred against states victim of it . 
   even today i 'm still paying an extra 5.5 % on income tax to buff up eastern germany 's pension . 
  as opposed to a 30 % pension decrease , for some people a complete loss of pension , and unpaid healthcare professionnals in greece to buff out german creditor banks . 
   why stop there ? 
  why not pay for romanian pensions as well ? 
  those are even lower than in greece ? 
  probably because you are not currently asking dozens of billions `` of debt '' from romania 's economy which is just as starving . 
  but , unifying wages and pensions and tax collection will be needed at some point if the eu is to ever fully integrate . 
   are you really asking me to pay for greek pensions as well ? 
  i think you are a dishonest person because you are trying to portray germany as the victim of the crisis by having to drop a bit of money and fund a bit ; while the greeks are the ones who are loosing by the hundreds of thousands ( formerly millions ) access to housing , employment , utilities , healthcare , food safety , etc etc ; most of them being hard workers ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/03/13/contrary-to-what-most-people-think-greeks-work-the-longest-hours-in-europe-infographic/ ) or having worked all their life for it . 
  a situation that is not really acceptable in the xxist century in the richest superpower on earth ( the eu ) , especially on matters that could be solved internally .
