  there 's a lot of ... interesting ressources in the ground below the far east in some places . 
  there 's going to be a point at which it 's going to be just too tempting for china not to try ceasing it . 
  if putin keep emptying the area to feed cannon fodder to the ua front , you really think they wo n't walk into the giant empty undefended plains just because there 's a ru flag on it ? 
   there would be immediate , massive nuclear retaliation . 
  like they are n't working on their own abm shield . 
   and you 're expecting citizens from a european country to be as good at insurgency as afghan warlords ? 
  better . 
  they have giant piles of ammunition everywhere , would be fighting at home , against an invader everywhere . 
  russian invader barracks & bases would explode with all hands every 2 days of the week . 
   what if the germans want a referendum ? 
  they do n't , and people there would laugh you out of the room at the suggestion . 
   and btw i have tons of other points you need to refute i do n't speak norwegian so ca n't read the article , sorry, 
   and if someone lives in france and speaks pakistanian as their first language , are n't they pakistani ? 
  except france is n't on the border of pakistan , and pakistanis there do n't all understand french perfectly since years nor consider themselves locals . 
  see , it 's more like our citizens all speak german in alsace/lorraine departments of france . 
  they 're still frenchs and consider themselves as french . 
  and most french citizens speak english or german as a second language . 
  does that make them not french or do that mean that the alsacians want to drive panzers in paris ? 
   here it says about 30 % , http://www.rferl.org rfel is usa 's own rt-like propaganda ( they do n't outright lies but exagerate a bit . ), 
  tailored to the russians , so it 's re using their own propaganda news . 
  the minority is probably closer to 10 % , and even if half that ( and that 's not the case , it 's probably closer to not even 1/10 of the russians in ukraine actually ) supported russian tanks coming in to kill the ua and pull a ru flag , that 'd mean 5 % of the population wants to invade the 95 % , so no . 
  as for the `` protests '' , lots of people are desperate because yanoukovich ran the country in the ground and people were litterally beggining to ration food money ( hence the revolution in kiev partly when his czar-level absurd fortune was exposed ) . 
  then russian provocaters ( ru military & services in civil ) came in and offered them 25 uah a day and sandwiches to protest against kiev in donetsk/luhansk/odessa / ... ( i 'm not kidding ) . 
  they agreed because `` oh well if i do it alone either way that wo n't make much of a difference wo n't it ? '' . 
  ( then when people in odessa refused to do it , and organized pro ukraine counter protests with the ultra ; the russians gunned them down in the streets , which led to the horrible odessa incident in the trade union building after the ultra pursued agents & their proxy caught in the middle in a building that caught fire )  crimea 58.3 % russian in 2001 good thing the russians are n't known to regularly falsify wikipedia since the beggining of the war to push their propaganda numbers on everyone : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10977082/russian-government-edits-wikipedia-on-flight-mh17.html as for the other one : `` in crimea more than two-thirds of the population claimed russian as its native language . '', 
  just because they use ru language does n't mean they are russians . 
  or are the usa/canada citizens all english ethnics ? 
   17.3 % of ukraine is russian minorities yeah that 's bs . 
  just like `` 25 % of the europeans are africans ! '' . 
   crimea has over 50 % that 's bs too , it 's 30 or even 25 % and that 's the most `` pro russian '' region of ukraine . 
  but of course when a russian soldier ( oh sorry , a totally_not_russian_little_green_men ) put an ak muzzle on your face and asks you if you support putin , the polls ( `` referendum '' ) have different results . 
   0.3 % of norway is russian and once russia starts it 's propaganda war it 's going to be `` 60 % '' too `` poor russian speaking victims from the people 's true demokratik respublika of norway fighting to free themselves from the oslo nazis that crucify kids '' . 
  see what i 'm saying ? 
  metro , station , ticket . 
  that 1 % or even 5 % in donbas is free to go if they want to live in russia . 
  but they 're not free to force russia on the entire country ( or even any part ) . 
  what happend when the russian minority in norway wants to declare it russia too ? 
  `` but there 's nobody there that would , just a few immigrants , thats bs !, 
  it would be the ru army and/or bribed idiots waving a flag for a 25 . '', 
  yeah , like in ukraine . 
  a third of that is n't combat ready . 
  of the rest , half of them ca n't leave russia without them getting invaded by china . 
  the other half , a big part deserted , a big part is busy harassing the baltics too , a part busy keeping the rest of their borders , and only 30 % of their military hardware is in fact in fighting shape . 
  realistically ? 
  russia can count on 250-300k top peak to invade ukraine . 
  it 'd become a nightmare for them fighting an insurgency that get 1:10 kill rates during the occupation and where every single local wants to kill them in their sleep ; irak style . 
   the ukrainian military is made up of volunteers who are woefully under-trained , as well as under equipped . 
  and 60 ' 000 in the ato area ( 190k country wide ) , with heavy artillery fire support . 
  rehab centers are controled by close minded religious priests ? 
  that 's worrysome . 
  some could even say they 're thinking about preying on people when they are their weakest on their way to recover . 
  : / ( edit : oh and stay strong , glad you recovered ), 
  he replaced one drug with another ? 
  orthodox jihadis : /, 
  there 's a decent idea , agreed, 
  i believe pictures from a russian driven & crewed t90 in ukraine ( e.g : http://sled-vzayt.livejournal.com/3367.html ) kindah goes against the russian narrative of ukraine hitting itself since months with magical russian weapons that appeared out of nowhere . 
  :( damn  ^ ( it can not be argued with ) ^ ( i think i just proved it false :p ), 
  erh . 
  mods . 
  you mean they export 7 % more to the eu than they import ? 
  and how much does the eu makes on their total exports ? 
  much of that would disappear if they stopped dumping and blackmailing other countries into accepting crazy debts . 
  then their economy would stop being so strong so of course they 'd never agree with it and would apparently rather see italy & spain follow greece the way of the dodo . 
   http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/07/22/bernanke-german-trade-surplus/ sorry but i have several problems with that article : - the first graphic has no precise source or information apart a line that indicate `` unctad '' on which i ca n't find the data that led to such graphic ??? 
  altho maybe it 's just the website ergonomy that 's just that bad and i could n't find it ; then feel free to correct me . 
  - bigger problem , i feel like the author got his conclusion first ( he wants to convince everyone that german dumping is good because it makes money come in the eu ) . 
  and he got that conclusion and he 's twisting and cherry picking data to support it & repeat it all along like a religious doctrine & trying to force it on the reader with various arguments . 
  instead of taking the data and drawing a conclusion from it . 
  ** quoting ** ( because i do n't agree at all . ), 
  : `` firstly , the trade surplus is now largely with non-euro countries . 
  ** there is also little evidence to back up the view that germany unfairly displaces exports from its neighbours and that it would import heaps more from said countries ** if there was a sustained effort through regulatory coercion and fiscal stimulus to try to make it happen . 
  if you still believe it is a eurozone problem then the only real answer is to suggest that germany leaves the eurozone . '', 
  translation : `` i reject any evidence that german policy is devasting the southern countries . 
  they are incapable and lazy and ca n't do more either way so it 's there fault if their balance is negative and they all crash ; anyone that is n't germany that get broke is guilty for it . 
  especially every southern countries . 
  and if you are n't happy with it we will instantly crash the eurozone by leaving it , murdering even more your economy alongside . '' . 
  ( since i 'm not an economist i would n't say that the author is a morron or an hypocrite with money & personnal interests in the question , but it 's highly tempting . ), 
  - on that article 's topic , well germany 's dumping could be a good thing ... * if germany actually shared back some of that money from everyone else it 's stashing under the mattress * ( and not in the form of x percent loan where the country have to mortgage half of it 's own country just to refund past loans , but with additionnal interests at each new cycle . 
  see also : greece ) . 
  right now sorry if i sound an horribly sore looser , but it sure feels like the german finance minister is more busy trying to keep lining up his pockets with german industry kickbacks & crushing syriza ; than thinking of the eu 's good like that article implies . 
  and he elevated german economy worshipping to a downright religious level at home . 
  ------------ btw , when you are saying `` that trade surplus is generated outside of the eu . 
  '' ; well please explain then how it could be so while so much of the trading is with eu countries first ? 
  http://www.worldsrichestcountries.com/top-germany-exports.html `` germany 's exports to france amounted to $ 134.6 billion or 8.9 % of its overall exports '' your own link : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports `` main export partners are : france ( 9 percent of the total exports ) , the united states ( 8 percent ) , the united kingdom ( 6.9 percent ) and netherlands ( 6.4 percent ) . '', 
  or : http://www.dw.com/en/surprise-jump-in-german-exports/a-18571930 `` exports to other eu countries made up the lion 's share , rising by an annual 6.2 percent , with exports to eurozone countries up a significant 5.1 percent . 
  but exports to non-eu countries also increased , logging a 2.3-percent rise . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_germany does n't seem to agree ? 
  because some growth is needed to compensate the deficit i 'd guess ( or debts will just pile up greek style ) . 
  and long term , we need to walk forward to avoid stagnation . 
  well it 's well known the german economy depends on economic dumping ( having their neighbors import everything from germany by undercutting even china ) . 
  which you could do easier by either not having to pay a living to workers who do manufacture said goods ( no minimal wage previously ) or loaning ( endebting ) states to buy you more stuff ( greece , italy , spain , . . ) . 
  turkey keeps open borders to let daesh pass . 
  they do n't stop people who enter or leave . 
  they plan to resettle ( soon , within month or years ) the bulk of them in syria whether in their `` safe zone '' or if a diplomatic settlement is reach & the jihadis removed militarily by everyone else . 
  granted , it 's more at the syrian border , but that should n't make much of a difference . 
  \\* shrugs \\*, 
  if they are on kos island , they came illegally from turkey . 
  so greece has no reason to necessarily accept illegals from turkey ( who kept open borders to let isis fuck over everyone ) . 
  ( but to answer your question straight , no , but the greek gov possibly could dependings , i 'd imagine ), 
  deport everyone caught in that riot and without proper greek papers to turkey ?
