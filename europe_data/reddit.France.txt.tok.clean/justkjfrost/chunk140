   if you already own an house pretty big if that does n't apply anymore to most youths ( ie most workers ) nowadays, 
   it is more than 0 and you wo n't find anything better that retarded logic is why everyone vote socialist in france . 
  because they enforce the minimal wage and judges still give the finger to employers that do n't want to pay and the gov give enough welfare so that everyone can eat . 
  if you do n't see the issue with `` 10 bucks a month is better than 0 '' then you 'll soon be heading to zimbabwe for a payrise . 
   ( this is the reason why those who can leave the country for better countries like spain or switzerland ) . 
  or , you know , you can put and enforce a minimal wage and emprison wage thiefs instead of encouraging them by doing nothing . 
   does that actually work ? 
  yup . 
  used such tricks for a long time when i was in a bind, 
   you are paid . 
  this is better than nothing lol , 100 $ ? 
  you make more money by buying the 1 $ promo bin at the supermarket and pawning it on ebay for 10 $ . 
  it takes even 1d to do it instead of 30 . 
  i might be mildly exagerating , but not that much . 
  what 's the point of doing the work if you are n't paid in the first place ? 
  pretty sure that 's wage theft, 
   what 's up with all the soros conspiracy ? 
  he 's a billionaire that back liberal causes like free speech or education ; and who did n't agree to cut a 1 billion $ check to the republican party when asked . 
  so they decided to call him litterally the devil and target him every possible time they can just like with obama . 
  russia also ca n't support him because they 're ultra conservative and see his liberal habits as endangering the putin administration . 
  so both the republicans and the russians collude to try to suppress him . 
   this is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  well if you do n't vote in your country 's elections , it 's your fault really  first of all , all decisions are secret ; we ca n't pinpoint anyone on a fuckup that 's not true . 
   second , decisions are made by negotiation and might not even represent the true opinion of one state . 
  that litterally does n't mean anything . 
   third , local governments are been elected on totally different items than what they do in brussels then you have an honesty problem in your country , i fail to see how is that bruxelle 's fault . 
  stop voting back liars like fillon or marine into power ? 
   fourth , the people delegated to the council and commission are not elected representatives . 
  that 's not true since the french president is elected and most chief or states are basically defacto elected too . 
  regarding the administrative commission , it is appointed by the chiefs of state , just like we appoint ministers . 
  it does n't bother you that the french ministers are n't elected , yet you think the eu ministers should be ? 
  talk about cognitive dissonance  fifth , the electorate has to synchronize at the entire eu level at the exact same time , and local elections do not occur at the same time . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean , but iirc eu parliament elections are ran eu wide ... 
  the next ones are in 2019 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2019  a federal europe with direct elections for the executive part can not come soon enough . 
  but tbh if you mean a directly elected eu president , to be honest i somewhat agree with you . 
  i suspect it would n't hurt to have a powerfull eu elected leader , with eu wide direct citizens votes . 
  that might help having a more coherent eu policy . 
  ( and for the records , no i do n't plan on running lol :d ), 
   this is because there is no politician to boot out . 
  there is 5 levels of indirection between a politician who fucks up and the electorate punishing him . 
  except that 's outright false : - a big part of the political power in the eu , the council ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council ) is straight up made of the chief of states or whatever his local title is ( president , prime minister , chancellor , etc ) ; which is up to your country 's electoral system to vote in or out at the next election . 
  - a second major pillar of power in the eu , the parliament , has it 's members that are straight up once again voted in by eu citizens : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_to_the_european_parliament#country_by_country if you decided to sleep in every time it 's up to vote for somebody more important than your mayor , then maybe it 's time to react . 
  edit : i get it i get it , yes there is a bit remaining of undemocracy ; that will need to be addressed at some point . 
  i do n't deny this . 
  but pretending that nobody is elected ( while it 's mostly democracy in fact ) ; is simply dishonest propaganda . 
  and no , nobody is planning to abolish country leaders afaik ; lol . 
  and yes they will keep real power even in a federal europe ( no puppets , no puppets , sorry for reusing trump 's joke ) . 
  ( i suspect federal europe is going to be the `` endgame '' of the eu at some point ), 
  holy hell . 
  what an horrible attack , that targeted killed plenty of civilians btw . 
  i firmly condemn it . 
  condoleances . 
  apparently it was done by islamists ? 
   the reason it 's unrealistic is because they just got replaced by robots . 
  both sides are greedy . 
  wanting not to be homeless and being able to pay your bills is not `` greediness '' on the employees part . 
  if you merely followed the inflation since 1970 the minimal wage should be at around 20 $ . 
  in fact , minimal wage was divided by 2.5 using inflation over the last 50 years . 
  to which i will add that nowadays most young workers are all paid the legal minimum ( if not less under the table ) when really it was a strict minimal floor level when the economy was working well . 
  so basically people 's wage was / 2.5 and 15 $ is still largely below . 
  so no , i think the employers that refuse to pay 15 $ ( which is defacto still a massive wage lowering ) are greedy asses . 
   for asking more then what they 're worth the republicans ' biggest lie . 
  `` people do n't deserve to be able to pay their rent and buy food while repaying the credit card in time , they 're not worth that much they 're just ~ ~ peasants ~ ~ burger flippers '', 
   the $ 15 minimum wage was unrealistic in was not helpful bullshit  and flipping burgers is n't worth $ 15 an hour bullshit . 
  spending your lifespan doing the actual work for a restaurant owner is worth quite a lot more than 15 $ / hour maybe if people like you were n't insanely greedy and taking away your employees livehood pretending `` they ai n't worth it '' , shit would n't be in the current situation, 
   communism is indeed a very wide spectrum of beliefs , but all of them are based on genocide and hatred too . 
  ^ point in case . 
  exhibit a of the usual right wing `` welfare supporters are stalinists plotting genocide and must be banned ! '', 
  talking head ... edit : you know , it 's ironic really how we came back full circle but the other way . 
  when i was a kid plenty of people made wishes like `` solving hunger in the world '' . 
  nowadays while everyone in occident ( or even most countries ? ), 
  can eat to their fill , plenty of gop people in charge apparently would rather want their neighbor to starve to death because `` it 's my money miiiiine !, 
  taxes are theft and proper distribution of welfare is communistic genocide !, 
  minimal wage is a theft i do n't owe anything to anyone !, 
   what 's finland ? 
  food ? 
  [ ^ i 'm ^ not ^ sure ^ alcohol ^ qualifies ^ as ^ such ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/e/ee/k9j6gdx.png/revision/latest?cb=20140323162201 ), 
   some people have lost faith in the democratic party in france neoliberalism ( `` supply side '' bullshit , attacks on minimal wages etc ) did serious damages ( in the past ) , leading to the mai 68 rebellion then the 80 's and later plenty of people to be fed by ( proper , non violent ) redistribution throught welfare and social housing . 
  so unsurprizingly those people support said redistribution ( because they like to keep eating every days ) ; so of course that leads us newspaper to scream about the return of the red terror . 
  ( i do n't think that people that voted for obama for food stamps were looking for a massacre but that 's just me ) because apparently according to the gop everything that is n't litterally trump ( ie marine lepen ) or even more right wing ( fillon , the french yanukovich . 
  an ex-obese big fat lying scumbag thief litterally ranting about the lazy entitled welfare queens while he 's busy stealing millions from the porch of his castles ) is litterally staline / s that said , i suspect that , assuming the elections are n't rigged , odds are melenchon will only be n \u00b0 2 ( ie loose the election in the final round ) ; it 's likely macron ( a right wing banker ) that 's suspected to be positionned to win the presidential election . 
  but bipartisan cohabitation or even a left wing parliament is highly possible . 
   fun fact : ohio is the home state of the most astronauts , mainly because they all wanted to get as far away from ohio as possible . 
  you laugh but one of the main reasons frequently quoted for having signed up for the military was `` seeing the world '' and `` doing something with their life '' , and a lot of astronauts are hired from ex us military people so ... :d, 
  ^ ( time to start distributing them confederate flags ), 
  i 'm going to make a quizz one of those days . 
  `` does this quote comes from a russian ur , turkish akp or us republican politician ? '', 
  ... akp psychos at it again , trying to murder anyone they dislike -_- ', 
  ^ ( the first thing that poped to my mind when seeing that `` freeedooooom ! '', 
  headline was ) [ ^ bravehearth ] ( http://followatch.fr/getimage?url=2014/06/braveheart.jpg ) edit : disclaimer , i do not intend to entice separatism in scotland . 
  i need to point out however they already consider doing so shortly after the brexit , and push for a second referendum, 
  ohhh . 
  already leaving us , nigel ? 
  yeah just two swiss flags / s, 
   in scottish waters haha . 
  on the bright side ( for the scotts ) , with the sell low prices now ( and high pumping costs in the sea ) , they wo n't overexploit it too fast . 
   `` swiss made '' seems to be a well known and protected branding in watches a large number of ebay 20 $ knockoff have `` made in switzerland '' written on the back tho edit : i mean , there is no way a watch like this one ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/swiss-balance-mens-watch-new-in-box-/391733973012 ; 10.50 # ) is an original lol . 
  i 'm sure it works , but the only thing swiss on it is the word engraved on it 's back, 
   what `` made in '' tells us is what standards/culture of work/attention to excellency etc the final product conforms to . 
  sadly not really .
