  well if every procuration order and sale is like the 7b junk submarines sold as `` refurbished working '' ... http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/10895239/greece-sues-for-7-billion-euros-over-german-submarines-that-have-never-sailed.html and greece is a very big buyer of weapons due to [ constant antagonism from turkey that claim the greek islands as their own territory and already annexed a few ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/17/turkish-news-website-156-greek-islands-belong-to-turkey/ ) . 
   the pm during that time papandreou was re-elected multiple times in the 80s and then again in the 90s after suffering a corruption scandal . 
   so really little sympathy there as expected by your overlords . 
   ok and you 're suggesting they did this to somehow bribe the government into going into massive debt , to these companies apparently ? 
  i 'm asserting it , yes . 
   how does that make any sense , these company 's are n't that big like that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens_greek_bribery_scandal, 
   the german federal government funded a greek political party ? 
  siemens , rheinmetal and others did ; and that ca n't have happened without at least some officials looking the other way ; if not outright colluding . 
   i 'm sorry but if you keep voting in idiots i 'm french so i do n't vote in greece , but quite frankly you have all the empathy of a rock  it 's certainly not the fault of other european citizens that 's for certain . 
  that 's you trying to weasle out of your own responsabilities in that situation if you are german, 
   you think democratically elected governments , repeatedly over multiple elections yeah about that bit , remind me , why did germany funded the pasok campaign then ? 
   they 're responsible for this mess . 
  victim blaming arseholness as it 's finest, 
   honestly , if you ca n't afford paying pensions to your people they can , the troika was trying to get them to push it beyond 70 so they could repay germany earlier . 
   then a higher pension age is a perfectly reasonable solution to the problem . 
  you people are always so eager to push others millions of citizens under a bus . 
   and if people want to retire earlier than that then they 'll have to save the money themselves . 
  you got to be paid a living for that first . 
   you think people who have shares in deutsche bank/commerzbank/bnp / etc. 
  ( or have part of their pension invested in a mutual funds that hold these banks ) are loan sharks , scammers , usurers , and criminals ? 
  no , but i think they made a bad investment by lending it to a loan sharking bank . 
   i 'm no friend of banks , but the problem of risky lending is n't solved by criminalizing average shareholders . 
  nor by destroying entire countries systematically by closing all their schools and hospitals . 
  if 1000 shareholder 's investments have to go down vs 2 millions greeks , the investments goes down for me . 
   received debt relief on war debt imposed on them in ww1 and ww2 , the latter by a dictator that 's the shoddiest argument i read in a long date  the debt was also much less than that incurred by greece that 's also not true . 
   we must not forget that it is the greeks that chose to run a massive deficit for decades because they were bribed/pressured by german authorities/businesses into overspending to german industries . 
   well the writeoffs still affect someone . 
  it is a fiction that no one will be hurt if we tell banks to write down these debts . 
  this is a case of loan sharking . 
  loan sharking being illegal in most countries . 
   but those shareholders are individuals too , and so are scammers and criminals . 
  this is n't a case for legalizing usury . 
   no one is going to offer them 80 % debt relief , that is a ridiculous proposition and yet we erased germany 's debts and actually funded them post war . 
  political hypocrisy much, 
   i mean , we did it , a country of 80 millions , with parts of country under communism until 1990 yeah talking about that they might want to dig up who funded the rebuilding of berlin & who paid or cut down most of their post war debts ... 
  33 % still is n't 80 . 
  and still does n't justify trying to sabotage retirement . 
  it 's not 1 % relief they need , it 's 80 % . 
  as loans with interests and partial postponment . 
  not debt relief . 
  but if there were n't any welfare or retirement , the system would also collapse . 
   no , i mean you personally are not owed a greek debt that you consider to be an asset . 
  yeah i do n't confuse my own personnal assets with policy accounts ... ( unlike , say , mr fillon , hint hint hint )  so you , personally , lose little or even nothing from the writeoffs . 
  that 's why it seems so simple . 
  yes and no . 
   it is always super easy to tell other people to write off their assets . 
  there are n't many individuals with anything to loose , nearly all the debts are to establishements . 
   that 's what we need but if we do get relief what stops other countries from creating unsustainable debt , then ask for relief ? 
  `` but if we give unemployment money , what 's to stop people from all quitting their job and becoming welfare queens ? '', 
  the ages old same neoliberal argument to remain greedy and try avoiding taxes ( ie a cash transfert union and debt relief at eu level here ), 
   giving them any larger debt relief would just give legitimacy to its behaviour . 
  considering that the troika tried to force rising the retirement age above 70 , it 's not about the banks . 
  the german finance ministry wants to hurt greece in every way they can till they are forced out of the eurozone and bankrupted . 
   but you can only say that because you did n't lend them any money . 
  another lie . 
  france wrote off a lot of money . 
  but it 's not worth trying to recover it at all and any price thereby making tens if not hundreds of thousands more homeless . 
   people like you wan na introduce a transfer union through the backdoor yup . 
   and dont hesitate to support a government of left - and right-wing extremists for that goal and there comes the big propaganda lie . 
  wanting retirement and healthcare to be funded ( by rising taxes on the wealthiest , including the richest governments and industrialists ) is not `` undemocratic extremism '' . 
   france was 1.7 % in 2016 . 
  `` what about france '' yeah this is n't a competition . 
  because the neolibs try to screw over france too does n't mean it 's ok to do it in other countries too . 
   `` national living wage would go up to # 7.50 ( $ 8.84 ) an hour from april . '', 
  that 's feels a lot like `` little too late '' to be honest . 
   but you were talking about cost of living , in that case house prices matter less what ? 
  you really think most people do n't have a rent or mortgage to pay that eat most of their paychek ? 
  you really think if it takes +10 % every 2 years you wo n't feel it ? 
   so , they have to do the reforms . 
  empty words that does n't mean anything . 
   its their choice since they are a sovereign country . 
  methinks that if they are stuck to the wall in a corner they will default on germany . 
   an undemocratic eussr transfer union is not an option . 
  oh fuck off ; this is more russian propaganda, 
  there are sadly different inflation rates in reality , between for example the markets ' ( finance ) inflation , the housing prices inflation , and the avg inflation between both . 
  housing prices take like +4 % per year . 
  that 's less than inflation ; ignoring the fact that a 2 % rise is a joke anyway . 
  you 'd need a 12 # / h wage to have proper living standards . 
  15 # to have good standards . 
   no , they need real reforms or leaving the euro . 
  that 's not correct because they would be facing overnight flash inflation , which would make the situation even worse . 
  that said reportedly 1/3 do n't have a living wage : https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/5u5co3/a_third_of_uk_lives_on_inadequate_income_says/ having a job is good , but having a job that pays you a monthly paycheck that goes above a handfull of peanuts is more usefull . 
  haha , 
  should n't they be court martialed ? 
  they need debt relief . 
  not loans , relief . 
  great ,

  +1 ^ ; pushing aside radical influences would be nice, 
  speaks volume about the ultimate condescention that party has for most of the electorate in reality . 
   hitler lookalike did nothing wrong . 
  `` alt right '' ( neo nazism ) in a nutshell, 
   at least its not as bad as when we used the anthem from borat for kazakhstan imagine they sing the confederate song while flying the confederate flag when introducing the us ... 
   europe can only be saved by a violent conflict because we are at war with islam , according to bannon . 
   partial translation : `` what baffled me the most , in our conversation , was that bannon apparently believed that war can have a cleansing effect : he 's a nazi that wants ethnic cleansing , if people did n't figured it out already . 
  he 's likely the writter of the new & recent ice raid orders , [ after having gotten the former heads of the ice fired and having replaced them with friends of him during the `` monday night massacre '' ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/30/trump-appoints-new-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-director-noted-for-his-work-deporting-illegal-immigrants/?utm_term=.1491bef87b2d&amp;tid=a_inl ) . 
  he is also responsible for ( amongst many other things ) the [ ice orders to arrest green card & visa holders in airports ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/steve-bannon-personally-overruled-dhs-decision-not-to-include-green-card-holders-in-travel-ban-cnn/ ) . 
  that guy is a nazi that want ethnic cleansing . 
  sorry but if it quaks like a duck , walk like a duck , look like a duck , float in a pond like a duck , ... edit : as for people that think i 'm exagerating the character , then read this : http://www.gq.com/story/steve-bannon-black-voters, 
  and that is why deciding of arrests quotas ought to be illegal and passible of legal charges , just like corruption .
