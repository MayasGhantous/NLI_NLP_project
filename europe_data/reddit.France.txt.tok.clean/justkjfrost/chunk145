  when they ca n't fill it for lack of criminals , cops are then forced to frame and pluck random people out of the streets or face being fired . 
  not a bad one either :d, 
  it 's not like they were trying to sell stuff so it was an imitation of capitalist ads for propaganda purpose ; and was probably treated by some producers as an excuse to toy with the arts, 
  autorities arresting dissidents and jailing them an eternity is nothing new sadly, 
  there are days i believe that the word `` inequality '' is a nice buzzword used to hide `` massive poverty '' . 
  but , yes . 
  to adress it , wages need to rise , tax money at least partly used for it 's original purpose ( social spending & welfare ; not just only giving handouts to billionaires & their corporations with state contracts ) ; and housing prices need to go down . 
  a house being worth 1 million $ in most of western europe means our generation will never own their home ; and when the rent + utilities is 80 % of the income for a lot of people ... 
  lol no i 'll vote left , hamon ( ps ) or melanchon . 
  i would side with the second more but he has an annoying anti-eu streak . 
  albeit he has some better grasp on the economy than the right ( by orders of magnitude ) ; and hamon does not have anything against the eu . 
  a hamon + m\u00e9lanchon ticket would likely win if they bothered btw ( a bit like a warren + sanders ticket in the us ) . 
   and macron not a dream for france tho . 
  the guy might as well be thatcherism lite for us . 
  somebody is trying to toss gazoline on the balkans and restart a fight there . 
  no it 's not the croatian official army symbol , op is an open liar . 
  here is the real one https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/seal_of_armed_forces_of_croatia.png, 
   according to wiki , he even got expelled in 2015 no he is n't . 
  he 's `` president d'honneur du partit '' , which loosely translate to `` dear party president '' . 
  and the wiki flatly states him as such :  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-marie_le_pen  pr\u00e9sident d'honneur du front national en fonction depuis le 16 janvier 2011 ( 6 ans et 25 jours ) \u00c9lection 16 janvier 2011 pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur fonction cr\u00e9\u00e9e \\ -  of corruption / legal loophole abuse . 
  nothing unusual , sadly . 
  no , that guy `` divested '' from his party and castle like trump `` divested '' `` out of his tower and business '' . 
  it 's legal fiction for legal purpose and the naive . 
   the one who got sidelined by his daugher/successor for being too extreme you mean ? 
  no , in a fit of great originality , he divested his construction companies and private ~ ~ tower ~ ~ castle and stuff to his daughter because iirc he was elected to some random shithole corner and had to get ride of all that for ethics rules reasons . 
  * reminds you of something ? 
   because clearly , they are really all total nazis who just ca n't wait to murder everyone who 's the wrong color , but are just trying to hide it . 
  right ? 
  what part of `` lets send them ebola '' coming from the party leader you do n't understand ? 
  dude , that ebola idea was from the party founder and leader , jean marie lepen, 
   no , no you do n't . 
  unless their main talking point about somebody with jewish-sounding name is `` hitler missed some , we 'll correct that once in charge '' and you argue to use ebola `` to solve the immigrant issue in africa '' . 
  do fpo do any of that ? 
   calling me an ignorant foreigner because , that 's very obviously what you are : /  we have a very similar party no , no you do n't . 
  unless their main talking point about somebody with jewish-sounding name is `` hitler missed some , we 'll correct that once in charge '' and you argue to use ebola `` to solve the immigrant issue in africa '' . 
   i was n't defending the fucking camp guards . 
  then why are you defending the political party they founded and their ranks full of people with the same tattoos , same songs and same attitude ? 
   no , that is utter delusion on your part . 
  i 'm not the one that never sat a foot in france , do n't speak french , never spoke to a fn member ( let alone watched them get arrested routinely ) and decided that `` they are n't so bad '' . 
   yeah , i 'm gon na stick with ` get some fucking nuance ' . 
  `` i 'm just asking for some proof that the camp guards and groups they founded might have been bad people '' . 
  this is borderline negationism . 
  and it feels like arguing with a flat earther to be honest . 
   all of them ? 
  did all the camp guards had them ? 
  did that made them ok ? 
  seriously , dude , stop . 
  you have no idea what is going on in france and it 's pretty obvious . 
  you 're defending followers of litterally hitler . 
   i did n't call them a normal party , i 'm just asking for some fucking nuance their members have waffen ss tattoos , and their founders helped build death camps . 
  there is no nuance in that . 
   the nazis were quite spectarularly evil . 
  the fn does n't hold a candle to them . 
  except when they were part of the wwii era nazi party and ss collaborators . 
   it 's not like this is an issue unique to france . 
  obviously , since there is some curious movement to fund all those national socialists parties coming from somewhere . 
   i did n't , but being austrian , ex-nazis being members of political parties does n't shock me . 
  we 're not talking minor party members here . 
  we 're talking a squad that litterally signed up voluntarily to help building fuckin auschwitz . 
  they 're true believers . 
   not to mention that party is 45 years old now . 
  it 's not impossible for nationalist movements to become less extreme . 
  you know i 'd love foreigners stop telling us french how they are `` just another normal party '' and that `` it 's hysteria '' when their members get arrested on a weekly basis harassing foreign looking citizens , singing hitlerian songs ( [ that is when they were not publishing albums of them with their own editing company ] ( http://www.konbini.com/fr/tendances-2/jean-marie-le-pen-patron-maison-de-disques/ ) ) or [ rising their arms ] ( http://reflexes.samizdat.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/grosse-ambiance.jpg ) and sport [ that kind of tattoo ] ( https://fafwatch.noblogs.org/files/2012/06/capture-7.png ) . 
  or [ that one too ] ( https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7277/6885493532_c83c7a886d_b.jpg ) . 
  you very obviously do n't know what you are talking about . 
   but comparing them with genocidal warmongers is simply ridiculous . 
  you know the fn party was founded with members of the waffen ss charlemagne division , right ? 
   not allowing dual citizensship is n't terribly unusual . 
  this is planned selective enforcement used for ethnic cleansing . 
  if you say they are looking for guys also a known as fraudsters with a foreign nationality specifically used to evade justice you can bet it 's not johnny they 're going to arrest , it 's rather mohamed and cohen ; despite the former owing millions to the french irs and the last ones having stolen a cheese at the local supermarket . 
   jesus christ , she 's much scarier than trump . 
  there is a reason so many people aknowledge the fn is fascist and possibly france 's nazi party . 
  oh he knows exactly what he 's doing . 
  he 's repeating russian propaganda that was used to destabilize ukraine & the balkans . 
  and this is why education is needed against such fundamentalistic total ignorance . 
  case in point , exhibit a for `` functionally illiterate ignorance '' . 
  and the gop is n't a party . 
  it 's a mafia gang . 
  in her case it 's more like gold ingots to her father and rubles for her, 
  they certainly do , i have to concur . 
  well he does look like lord becket in pirates of the carribeans , got ta give him that . 
  the character being the main villain of the 3 first movies ofc . 
  not bad haha :d, 
  well if simply lying outrageously and pushing an `` alternative reality '' works for the reaganist , it 's unsurprizing that the nazis in europe start going full goebbels too and post photoshoped ( falsified ) pictures, 
   [ have ] these companies that operate in the single market to have a different legal entity . 
  that seems like a safer bet seeing how things are going . 
   just what he has been accused of is unclear . 
  `` ahmadreza has informed his family in iran that he was forced to sign a confession , but the content is unknown , '' says the petition . 
  `` his family has been informed that the investigation relates to an issue of ` national security . ' they have no evidence against him , but they are continuing to keep him . '', 
  charming . 
  so they do n't even know what he 's accused of but he 's gon na be executed ?? 
  edit : he 's accused of spying . 
  not sure it 's worth the death penalty tho , what with them seeing [ spies everywhere ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/3229526/iran-arrests-pigeons-spying-on-nuclear-site.html ) edit the word is that he 's accused of `` collaborating with scientific of ennemy nations '' . 
  if that is about his medical work , that 's downright ridiculous . 
  ignorance like yours is criminal . 
  furthermore i 'm wasting my time answering , / ignore, 
  no , because for every idiot that will be fed that placebo ; there will be 10 people that need actual medecine and get sold those sugar pills . 
  you know people are dying of measles in america right now ? 
  measles . 
  because their parents do n't believe in medecine but homeopathy because no doc dared telling them to fo .
