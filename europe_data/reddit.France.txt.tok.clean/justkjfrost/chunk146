  some culture for you : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snake_oil, 
  stop trying to justify deadly scams . 
  that too is bad ignorance . 
  dont cut yourself , people . 
   the whole point of medicine is to make people get better . 
  if that can be achieved with a placebo then give them a placebo . 
  this is dishonesty and ignorance . 
  we can not allow the sale of fake medecine as `` medecine '' just because in 0.1 % cases placebo effect might do something which has no better results than so called `` faith healing '' vs vaccination . 
  this is how you get people killed . 
  there 's a reason why medical doctor is a job with particularly long training , and no you are n't one just because you decided to sell suggary water . 
   the placebo effect is a scientific fact though . 
  that 's not a valid excuse to sell fake medecine to the sick and needy . 
  [ snake oil salemanship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snake_oil ) is illegal and treated as a scam in most societies . 
   but there 's also no real reason to increase the risk of superbugs by giving people antibiotics when bedrest will do the trick as well , this dismissal of modern medecine you are displaying is destructive and frightening . 
  most sicknesses and conditions absolutely can not be solved by `` bedrest '' nor placebo , and selling fake medecine as the real deal will only keep pushing more people to fill in their own grave early . 
  thousands die because of homeopathy bullshit every year , because people thought they were treating themselves when really they were n't . 
  lol ; i 'm used to the `` reaganist refom of food stamps '' . 
  let 's cut the crap with the euphemisms . 
   to be completely fair with people who make use of omeopathic medicines however , most times they fall for how they are marketed . 
  that can be improved by forcing markings on boxes as `` homeopathic '' . 
  but when people go to see the `` homeopath '' ; they know what they are going to see it 's not a mistake . 
   i know lots of people in italy who buy omeopathic because they think `` it 's natural '' , as opposed to `` made in big giant factories '' . 
  a `` drug '' ( as in `` meds '' ) can be natural and based on a plant and have an active ingredient . 
  there are in a lot of countries drugs based on known products such as ( yes ) marijuana or coca leaves and other plants . 
  it 's kindah hard to deny they have a very real effect . 
  homeopathy on the other hand , by definition , has no active ingredients for it 's own part . 
   they walk into a pharmacy , they see a box with the name of a molecule on one side , and next to it a nice package with bees and rainbows , which one do you think my grandma would get ? 
  in france pharmacists are supposed to have medical training and advise the client on a product adapted to the needs ( even if you should see a doctor instead as a first ressort ofc if you have health issues ) ; not to try to make maximum quick money . 
  so , theorically if your grandma do n't know but still has some sense , she can ask the pharmacist that is supposed to point out the box with a molecule on the side . 
   he 's also interested in renegotiating eu treaties or the possibility of leaving if it all fails along with nato . 
  that 's the one thing that makes me hold back regarding m\u00e9lanchon to be honest . 
  i love the eu and i 'd be annoyed it 'd end up dismantled for short term gains . 
  the guy is an honest socialist , but his anti eu stance makes him itch ( and i know `` renegociation '' wo n't work just like it wo n't work for trump 's nafta , and did n't worked with brexit so it 's obviously an excuse to attempt to leave the eu :\\ ) . 
  the guy 's a litteral rotschild banker that want to remove most taxes on the wealthiest ( like the isf or roof taxes 1/3 below currently ) and abolish ( and likely embezzle from personnal experience ) a lot of very important welfare ( rsa , apl , aide alimentaire , aide pour les utilitaires , ... ) that keep hundreds of thousands of household out of the streets and fed . 
  ( as a side note , any politician that tried touching the rsa ended up revealed as corrupt thiefs . 
  every . 
  last . 
  one . 
  them . 
  so it 's my crook detector . 
  kindah like politicans cutting snap food stamps in the us . ), 
  that guy is `` centrist '' like a libertarian republican , which he likely actually is ; having known ties with us gop hardliners . 
   fran\u00e7ois fillon : les r\u00e9publicains he 's the hard right if there is one and fillon was even one level above him in the logic of madness , true , good point . 
  he is also in the middle of an outlandish serie of embezzlement scandals and ghost jobs and fake expanse bills that would make the romanian gov or yanukovich proud . 
  a true corrupt thief at hearth . 
   she 's the more nationalistic `` right '' yeah . 
  [ `` alt right '' as they now call themselves . 
  the kind of right that rise their arm and yell `` heil hitler '' and make steve bannon genocide jokes as soon as the cameras are out . 
   who will win ? 
  it 's really hard to say . 
  agreed for once, 
   the worst is that there are people who refuse real meds/doctors and trusts only on homeopathy . 
  that 's probably akin to parents that refuse to drag their kids to the doctor/hospital/paramedic / whatever and use faith healing . 
  yes , frequently it ends up poorely : /, 
  not sure that 's any better ah, 
  well they are right yeah . 
  it 's basically a placebo in most case or even toxic fake medecine in some worst ones ; and you ca n't heal sickness with water sorry . 
   normal levels are 0-50 , while anything measured above 300 is considered hazardous . 
  yesteday we measured at 1,218 . 
  okay , it really is that bad . 
  http://www.mia.mk/en/inside/rendersinglenews/324/132843824 it looks like skopje has central heating tho . 
  maybe pushing more houses to use it ; and pushing corporations to use airfilters on their polluting factories might help with the insane pollution levels ? 
  edit : my bad , bitola too . 
  edit : lowering crazy electricity prices would go a long way too to allow elec heating . 
  edit : ( article in french ) http://www.lapresse.ca/environnement/pollution/201701/18/01-5060704-macedoine-skopje-est-la-capitale-europeenne-la-plus-polluee.php ( 1300d related per y :\\ ) eu data http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer-2015/countries/the-former-yugoslav-republic-of-macedonia ( do n't yell at the name designation , i know )  in 2012 , the national plan for the protection of ambient air quality [ 10 ] was adopted , with measures for transport , energy , industry , agriculture , air pollution and air quality . 
  the programme for gradual reduction of emissions of polluting substances at national level [ 11 ] , contains projections for 2012-2020 and reduction measures . 
  it does appear the country has some air regulations . 
  now , they will need to enforce them . 
  that , however , is a major corruption problem . 
  like in romania . 
  and to convince people to use central / elec heating instead of wood . 
  and possibly push electric car technology too if they want to do it properly ( like by offering partial refunds ( cashback subsidies ) directly to citizens buying electric instead of gazoline/diesel cars ) . 
  edit relevant !, 
  looks like they are pushing for less polluting fuel too  http://www.independent.mk/articles/37260/skopje+mayor+introduced+subsidy+program+for+pellet-heating+systems here 's to hope that system could be expanded too , and that the money do n't all get stolen somewhere along the road by corrupt officials first-serving themselves ( this is macedonia after all :\\ ) edit  poverty in the country : more than 50 % of households still using firewood as primary source of heat to be honest it 's partly a corruption issue . 
  the centralized heating was built with the intention of crashing prices in mind at the time ; and if the prices are unaffordable it means that somebody ( somebodies ) are possibly plundering money or price gouging along the way . 
  edit and , obviously , the macedonian gov could use some pressure to apply regulations and stop stealing money : /, 
  dman . 
  mass use of coal + polluting industry without regulations + lack of wind + total lack of airfilters ( because corporations would rather save 1 $ on it ) + heating with wood to save money ? 
  i understand that . 
  i mean , for the search engine , the key word associated to most relevant content is likely `` syria '' , so it 's missing a lot of relevant results on `` siria '' and you 'll likely only have italian-only articles sent back to the search engine with that word . 
  if there is only italian and russian results intended for italians showing up ( especially since the last ones are probably trying to game up the pagerank system with seo ) , well , that 'll slant the search results a lot ... 
  the fact that no other countries tries pushing out news in italian as much results in that result . 
  it 's a bit of a `` first came first served '' issue that happens when you have only one foreigner showing up to be served . 
   if we google `` siria well ; it 's written `` syria '' in most languages so it 's probably a `` typo '' influencing it ( from a technical search perspective ) . 
  but , yes , russian media are prevalent on a lot of topics , and sputnik clearly is n't the top of the russian bin either, 
   is `` cats of europe '' going to be a thing ? 
  ^ ( finally , one thing i can fully blame david cameron for ), 
  ^ ( or lack of thereof ), 
   we can afford a huge welfare sector yet even we do n't have such a low retirement age . 
  retirement is n't particularly exceptional in ukraine in reality , being generally above 65 in most cases . 
  what i do note however in ukraine is a will of a handfull of well known billionaires to try to get pensions cut for good so they can get the money as subsidies for themselves . 
  just like in the us . 
  to which i would add ukrainians are paying retirement in taxes so really they 're only getting back what they paid earlier . 
  so , anyone that tries to take pension ( or healthcare or education or gaz heating ) money away can fuck right off as far as i 'm concerned . 
   if you ignore that , you will get greece , venezuela , `` if you do n't do as we say you 're going to end up like venezuela '' is something the us neocons have been repeating to france for the last 80 years , and as far as i 'm concerned they can still fuck off . 
  especially now that we 're seeing how blatantly dishonest the gop is under president evil . 
  `` supply side economics '' and `` trickle down '' and `` cut everything that is n't subsidies to corporations '' are simply propaganda for systematic economic looting . 
   no matter how you put it , paying a still capable workforce to stop working is a detrimental economic decision . 
  what you just said is retarded and simply bad economics ; since productivity is decoupled from work nowadays . 
  from an economic point of view , you 're not paying them to sit ; you 're paying them to keep on living so they can consume .
