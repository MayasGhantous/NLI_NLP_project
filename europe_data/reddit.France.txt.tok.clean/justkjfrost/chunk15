  : / it 's relatively safe if poor , and will send a message that we do n't tolerate violence . 
  well , i hate defending the russians , but if a country deserves it , it 's probably the ksa . 
  here is something that i support 100 % . 
  if anything else it 'll force people with underwhelming skills to retrain . 
   next time just post `` i 'm 15 years old and very smart '' , so i do n't waste my time . 
  next time just post `` i 'm above all responsabilities and feel the need to tell the frenchs that they were nazi collaborators '' as a flair while you 're at it . 
  there 's 50 years of difference between the current frenchs and vichy . 
  there 's 0 year of difference between current russians and what 's happening currently in neighboring countries . 
  but okay if you want to say you have no control over your gov , i can get that much . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'd answer `` then enlight us \u00f4 mighty '' , but seeing a bavarian flag instead of a russian one i ca n't help but wonder whether you are another foreigner that never even got close to russia , or another expat that fled it but ca n't help but defend it despite russia invading ukraine & being general asses with everyone as of late . 
   you guys went totally crazy with your hatred . 
  denouncing russian bombings & russians dismissing it as a joke is hatred . 
  russia bombing it 's neighbors is n't . 
  right . 
  a spoon a day keeps the russian missile away ? 
  okay . 
  and if during one of their exercise they `` accidentally '' empty a full grad load on an latvian village like they regularly do in ukraine , what do you think is going to happen ? 
  because , with the current standing orders ( because nato soldiers wo n't take russian missiles in the face without replicating . 
  and it 's actually a good thing . 
  ) ; that russian position will be a smoking crater 10 seconds later , and it 'll escalade from there . 
  i think most russians do n't understand how close they currently are to a war with the eu/nato . 
  it 's worrying they dismiss it that easy . 
  no invading ukraine & sabre rattling in front of the baltics or germany is n't something you can `` not take seriously '' . 
  the word you are looking for is `` russophobia '' ; which for some reason seems proportionnal to the russian military effort to keep pushing in ukraine & other places & joking about leveling berlin , the baltics or other places . 
   why you attack me with that ? 
   though i could also say they have killed half of my family the german 's grandparents killed your grandparents . 
  and it 's horrible . 
  but what it has to do anything with russians painting `` to berlin ! '', 
  on their explosives ? 
   so silly , hope germans do n't take it too seriously and why do you dismiss russian invasions so easily why russia is currently at this very instant showing they are in to do the extreme inverse , killing lots of people & invading ? 
  while they are exactly doing that in ukraine ? 
  i get it , i did the same mistake during peace time ; but now it 's not the case anymore . 
  pointing out wwii stuff and using it again nearly a century down the line is exactly what putin is doing to justify invading ukraine , '' because they are literrally hitler '' . 
  right . 
  you are joking about bombing their capital while invading another country , but no biggie right ? 
  let 's also just ignore for a minute that said germany you want to bomb and invade is the last real occidental country still friendly towards you ... what could possibly go wrong in that . 
  conscription is forcing people to do something . 
  slavery is taking advantage of their condition . 
  here the point is not to make anything of value but to reverse the daesh social programming impressed on them . 
  civil service once they get out . 
  forced conscription to a worker 's service ( public interest stuff like roads or cleaning or construction ) with military-like enforced discipline ( but nobody trust them with a weapon duh . ) . 
  pay them so it 's not slavery , and force them several years in to enforce another lifestyle in . 
   `` we should do what they do in the netherlands , where they move the most hard-core islamists away from the other muslims so they ca n't inspire them , '' khader said . 
  definitely that too, 
  the russia of the 90 show this is a lie ( people literally starved to death while there was plenty of food nobody could afford ) . 
  or even our own homelessness levels in paris . 
  except life in greece do n't costs even nearly the same in albania or cambodja . 
  they do n't have easily 500 $ / mo of rent when going cheap . 
  everything costs about as much as in germany . 
  so when you destroy their income ... 
  but everybody ( esp the germans ) told me the greeks where lazy and deserved extreme poverty !, 
   `` due to growth in [ meat industry ] production volumes , the level of self-sufficiency in the domestic meat market rose from 77 % to 82 % , with a target level of 90 % set by the state food security program . 
  in particular segments , replacing imports is happening even faster than expected , '' said deputy agriculture minister dmitry yuriev . 
  i believe i already read similar claims of ~ ~ [ juche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juche ) ~ ~ `` complete russian self sufficiency '' . 
  by the stalinian era party , in my history textbooks . 
  soooo just like during the ussr when there was enough food produced for moscow , st petersburg . 
  just to be clear , this is n't about the eu . 
  no state , whatever it is , can be 100 % self sufficient since ` round 1920 and with modern populations/progress . 
  if the state wants to be viable long term , it needs to trade with other countries ( ffs at least buy chinese food ... ) . 
  he was rewarded the position for being a loyal corrupt agent ? 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmitry_peskov  over the course of ten years , peskov rose through the ranks to become the first secretary of the russian embassy in ankara , turkey . 
   in 2000 he returned to russia to work at the press service of the russian president , serving a number of positions , including a four-year term as first deputy press secretary of the russian president from 2004 to 2008 . 
  he has served as putin 's spokesperson since april 2000 . 
  plenty of opportunities to steal all the moniez, 
  620k only ? 
  they all steal within the hundreds of millions to billion ( s ) range usually . 
  guess he decided to go modest and spend his cash on something else . 
   spokesman do not have much chance to be corrupt . 
  haha, 
  i thought the republicans were retarded , but that official truly takes it to next level . 
  that 's how you get a giant aids and other std epidemic and kill a massive number of russians . 
  like it was n't bad enough with the transmission issue with rampant drug habits . 
  stds killing everyone would massively * decrease * the population in russia . 
  you want families to have lots of kids ? 
  pay them extra welfare per number of kids . 
  see numbers of kids rise . 
   would make citizens more `` disciplined '' riiiight . 
  like `` abstinence education '' ever worked hahaha . 
   gennady onishchenko , a former chief sanitary doctor known for his creative approach to medical advice ,  which also called for a ban on x-ray and ultrasound machines , defibrillators , incubators and other medical equipment . 
  ... haha . 
  approaching modern medecine by banning it . 
  `` creative '' . 
  right . 
  i 'm sure that for example [ leaked long pdf of terms forced on greece in exchange for being allowed to stay in the eurozone & get an extension ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/files/2015/07/prior-action-final-version-july-2015.pdf ) was totally written by bulgaria and the czechs ; and totally not by the german finance ministry & bce ( taking orders from them ) & imf ( ditto ) / s ( yes it 's not the last version but i 'm too lazy to find again the public link to the last one ) do you even bother checking what your own country 's gov do from times to times ? 
  i 'm sure it 's `` hilarious '' to the 60 + y old that got their pension abolished . 
  or to those that earned 500e/mo that now have to live on 250 . 
  or those that now have to choose between food & meds . 
  or when you want to buy groceries and there are no working atm in the area because germany put caps on national liquidities . 
  there are no sector of the economy or welfare or any people in greece that were n't hit very hard by constantly new and creative clauses dictated by schauble . 
  the image is sadly quite fitting . 
  come on sweden , you 're better than that . 
  tell them to f ** k off : / it 's to the immigrant to integrate & adopt the local culture . 
  certainly not the other way around . 
  wow congratulations ; i never though i 'd actually see the conviction pass . 
  glad to see the case stuck with the overwhelming evidence . 
   i 'm just trying to drive home ( `` for what is available '' ) that they 're presently fighting over existing scraps rather than creating more . 
  and i 'm trying to point out that no , this is not the case . 
  they are not fighting over scraps . 
  there are a few individuals that artificially declared that flats in paris are a `` rare '' commodity while this is n't the case at all .
