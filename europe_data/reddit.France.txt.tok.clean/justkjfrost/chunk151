  387 # a month \u00f4o and here i was bitchin about the sncf 's prices  this equates to an average of 14 per cent of monthly earnings , well , if amazon wages ( 900 # ) are the new standard ... 
  they want a diplomat , not the joker spreading emptying gazoline everywhere, 
  i 'm hearing troubling reports on provincial hospitals . 
  athens and big cities are supplied ; but in random corners it 's not always the case apparently . 
  also they seem to face chronic shortages of medical employees because they ca n't afford to wage enough personnal . 
  i 'm wondering whether offering them free medical supplies & humanitarian help ( msf personnal deploying there in their hospitals ? ), 
  would allow them to rebalance their budget to more normal and european levels tho . 
  it 's probably doable for western countries without breaking the bank . 
  edit stuff like http://www.ekathimerini.com/213612/article/ekathimerini/news/state-hospitals-paralyzed-by-shortages-and-a-lack-of-maintenance ambulances not replaced or no money for the gasoline , etc http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/10/18/greek-hospital-workers-union-complains-of-ambulance-shortage-problem/ and this is n't a new thing . 
  with 7 years of austerity by now , they never were able to actually replenish their supplies or fix shortages at any points : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3970095/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/27/greece-blames-drug-companies-shortages https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/greek-debt-crisis-damage-healthcare-hospital-austerity edit my conclusion is that greece probably healthcare humanitarian relief at that point ( but do n't dare say so because it 'll be used as another excuse against them to add extra pressure and/or ask them for another bill they ca n't pay ) the migrant crisis also absorb some of the ressources going there , which admittedly does n't help ( but we ca n't really blame the greeks for that either ... ) . 
  sending them extra ressources if only for that would relieve pressure on the bulk of their own healthcare system ( by displacing a large part of the healthcare problem away from their own hospitals ) . 
  i 'm seeing isolated relief efforts ongoing ( http://www.msf.org/en/where-we-work/greece http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/europe-central-asia/greece/humanitarian-crisis-in-greece--red-cross-scales-up-response-71991/ ) , but i would suggest that the eu/major western european nations start thinking of organizing some effort at their own level .

   but deep down they all know that they are as rotten as the right . 
  uh not really . 
  currently a large chunck of the mainstream right is the ump ( hilariously corrupt and seeing another money grabbing scandal explode every few weeks ) and fn ( which is very well known by now for its ... xenophobic ... politics ) . 
  at that point the right wing might want to do something to get himself candidates that are n't either mafia-friendly or nazi-friendly . 
  i guess macron is somewhat attempt being that but he 's the closest thing there to an honest-to-oil american republican who happens to also be french ( but then i 'm a dem ... ) . 
   they ca n't enter the border are closed if by `` italian/france border '' you mean they control train tickets ? 
   but the brit and the hungarian are still less human than us . 
  complete nonsense . 
   the burning of 650 cars would be on par with orr significantly worse than the very worst rioting / protests in the u.s. over the last two years . 
  not really because it 's spread country wide so it does n't really draw any direct street attention ; a bit like gun violence in the us . 
  thousands die from gun wounds each years , but you do n't always see it centered on big riots/gang shootings, 
  they stopped doing that because some considered it competition and set out to burn more ( srsly xd ) . 
  it 's sadly almost a running gag at that point . 
  there are also rumors that it encouraged some people to ... incidently receive insurance compensation on their shitty old car . 
   you mean nothing was leaked ? 
  there was actually , luxleaks indicates evasion help during his time as a pm for luxembourg . 
  but for more recently ; nothing really against the interests of the eu turned out regarding is time as an eu official . 
  of course there are divergences and disagreements regarding policies on some points , but nothing that could n't be seen as in the interest of the continent in some way . 
  i think he does have the eu 's interests in mind as of late in a general manner . 
  there can always be plenty of things i do n't know about , but as of now i do n't see any major conflict of ethics . 
  when he was pm of luxembourg , yeah , we know . 
  but thankfully there has been no such report since he started working as president of the eu itself . 
  they did n't `` just threw bacon sandwiches '' ; they also threw rocks and assaulted people , threathened passerby with death etc and basically acted like a biker gang doing a raid which resulted in police being called on them . 
  but thank you for being the posterboy for `` misleading by taking things out of context '' ^ ^ ^ / s furthermore , i doubt anyone said `` the solution is death '' , this is fantasy . 
  in europe , murders in prison generally happen either by other prisonners ( ie stuff like getting shanked for looking wrong at the wrong one or accused of stealing bread by another prisonner ) , or by guards on a powertrip going wayyy too far . 
  they 're not ordered by justice . 
   lots of fuckers in this country will praise this attack or blame the victims by accusing them of being kafirs for drinking and enjoying nightlife . 
  that 's depressing . 
  that mentality needs to change for the country to continue on the road of progress :( once again , condoleances to all the victims . 
  this horrible act against innocent partygoers that just wanted to live fully their life ( and especially killing other people in the name of religion ) is an abomination . 
  ( continuating my last post ) 0400 sputnik pretended that the shooter got killed . 
  but sputniknews is a very unreliable outfit . 
  i 'm trying to look up for whether there is further confirmation, 
  whatever, 
  stop trying to whitewash the responsability ultraconservative islam plays in those attacks . 
  whitewashing isis ideas is not going to do you nor anyone any favors . 
   we 've ( and parts of europe ) has seen this with the far-left ( and pkk is an offshoot in a way ) as well . 
  you are trying to willfully mislead the conversation to the pkk to draw attention to them instead of isis . 
  sod off with that regarding `` left wing terrorism '' historically it has nearly always been politically/economically motivated ; while islamic terrorism is absolutely caused by people taking their religion as an excuse to attack others and spreading that idea to others . 
  as long as you got retarded preachers paid to lie that `` allah wants you to kill x and x and oppress women '' ; or a government that gives priority to better jobs to conservative islamists ; you 're never going to solve stuff like daesh or shitholes like konia that generates them . 
  salafism/wahhabism is a branch of islam that went completely evil , and it will need to be fixed to start fixing the jihadi issue . 
  ( i do n't know how as of yet , but i can point out there is a major social problem somewhere in there )  and this probably wo n't be fixed by solving the ` religion ' problem . 
  patently false . 
  isis is based on that religion . 
  you litterally can not solve daesh without solving their religious crazyness too . 
  as long as the turkish gov thinks it 's ok for people to live like daeshis and quote the quran daylong to live like 1500y ago instead of sending people to a maths school and teach them modern engineering or something equally usefull to society , you 'll have that kind of islamic terror bullshit . 
  sadly you probably have good points . 
   getting involved in the syrian civil war whixh was none of our business to be honest looking how things went there ; i definitely do n't blame erdogan for trying to intervene in syria initially . 
  shit , i support coalition troops there ( but we fight isis instead ) . 
  what i would blame him for however is to have sided with the worst islamists in the lot for a long time . 
  to the point that only the salafists had the better weapons , so all the more moderate fsa got outgunned and sometime even destroyed ( or had to join the sdf ) ; which probably doomed to failure the fsa 's revolution . 
   helping islamist factions in the war some of which formed/joined isis later , ( ... ) legitimizing isis by calling them `` not terrorists but a bunch of angry kids '' yeah that bit likely did n't helped at all : /  islamizing the society starting with the education system that definitely damaged the country and will lead to more instability in turkey ... stating it will likely anger a lot of people ; but there are direct links there , statistically speaking big picture ( trends we see on most countries ) : - the less educated , the more religious and more people frequently end up terrorist - the more religious conservative , the less people pay attention to education , the more terrorism/violence and major stability problems increase in society - the more education , the less conservative religion is in the area over time , the more stable and prosperous countries tend to end up . 
  and so akp pushing religion everywhere and it 's ultraconservative form will likely damage heavily the country in the next ten year ( a lot less people getting higher education and leading the country to a better futur ; but more `` allahu ackbar '' to be expected ) . 
   how the fuck is akp not responsible for even a single one of them ? 
  i 'd say there are degrees of blame ; it 's not black and white . 
  like the past bombing one timed with the law to give him more power was very suspicious and had a number of mit fingerprints on it . 
  that one does not at all . 
  i mean you can blame akp for not stamping isis when they had the opportunity , but sometime things escape service grasps . 
  cf the attacks at the bataclan or orlando , which are very similar to this one . 
  but it is true that turkey has a problem with radical islam and desperate people pushed to become ever more conservative ending up crazy and doing terrible things like this . 
  i do n't think violence is a solution to it ; probably more education would help . 
  dislike for akp apart ; we saw no indication that it was akp or mit doing there that look like a real , non false flag , daesh terror attack . 
  if that is verified , that could be as a revenge for albab ; and their third attack on a night club . 
  at that point i 'm starting to think the jihadis ca n't support people being happy so they try to kill everyone that is using religious excuses for their jalousy/hypocrisy/frustration, 
  oh damn : / and in santa costume , wtf ? 
  ( reference time of my post is paris clock ) edit 0113 linked video apparently https://twitter.com/_infodujour/status/815349672365740032 edit 0114 already 2d apparently : / condoleances . 
  0117 number of attackers fuzzy , some say 1 , some say 2 , some say 3 ... 0120 from the live topic of reddit : earlier today cnnt\u00fcrk reported that police were providing nye security by going under cover dressed as santa claus.https : / / t.co / n0hmckvmzt confusion between a shooter and a cop ? 
  shooter disguised as a cop ? 
  we do n't know yet at all ; but apparently odds are the shooter was n't a cop but isis by now ( 0251 ) . 
  regardless ; the whole incident is likely a terror attack . 
  0122 http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/gun-attack-on-popular-night-club-in-central-istanbul.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=107983&amp;newscatid=509 the press suggest 35 + killed 35 + k 40 + i hearthbreaking incident ; i hope they will find/catch the culprits 0126 some people seem to think they heard allahu acbkar ; but no way to be sure . 
  that would find 0133 the turks are now saying there was possibly a single attacker 0146 part of the reasons the death toll is high is because it was a nightclub completely full ( 700 + people reportedly ) and somebody went in and opened fire straight on everyone no claims that i know about yet , but the modus operandi fits with daesh once again at that point i 'm starting to think the jihadis ca n't support people being happy so they try to kill everyone that is using religious excuses for their jalousy/hypocrisy/frustration 0216 turkish media gag order reported regarding this attack ; from the pm 's office ; except on relaying official statements 0230 relevant footage showing armed gunman entering while shooting https://twitter.com/haberturktv/status/815363666828726272 0240 whitehouse also condamned in the strongest term the barbaric attack ( and so do i ) . 
  0309 mogherini ( defacto eu foreign minister ) condemns the attack too . 
  our thoughts goes to the victims . 
  0307 there are rumors the attacker ( s ? ), 
  spoke arabic 0325 rt.com ( the kremlin news outftit ) now suggest the attack was suspected earlier :  the owner of the reina 's nightclub , mehmet ko\u00e7arslan , has claimed that the club had been warned about a possible attack , and that the information came from us intelligence services . 
  security measures had been taken , he added . 
   `` us intelligence warned about such an attack about one week or 10 days ago -- and measures have been taken , including [ on ] the sea front . 
  and look what has happened , '' ko\u00e7arslan told turkish daily hurriyet . 
   and some tweets from politicians are hinting he was not murdered in prison . 
  care to link some ? 
  that said the prison & legal staff refuses to speak so unless it goes out to the press with more info it 'll be hard to say  he was sentenced under a blasphemy law well the top of the bbc article directly contradicts you ? 
   kevin crehan was sentenced at bristol crown court in july for racially-aggravated public disorder . 
  from what i can gather , the `` blasphemy '' thing is a rumor spread by angry ... right wing supporters ... who wanted him out and twisted things . 
  i mean there 's a group of big individuals that goes to a building ( a mosque in that case ) , start tossing stuff at it ( yes , including bacon and sandwiches ) ; yell at people working there and shove them and passerbies to start a fight ; yell random racist/xenophobic threats ; the cops get called in and arrest the gang ; that does n't shock me . 
  i would suspect the apologists want pretend it 's supposed `` anti christian persecution '' and a `` war on christianity '' in it and so invented a bit on top of it to make it plausible . 
  happy new year everyone !,
