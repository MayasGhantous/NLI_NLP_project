   what is wine ? 
  considering czechia is a wine producer too ... :-p, 
   three other people also admitted taking part in the incident in january where a member of staff was also racially abused the comment hints that the group assaulted somebody ; which is why they actually got those sentances . 
  that said it looks like somebody murdered him in prison ; which is completely out of line , agreed . 
  i take it as an excellent sign . 
  it means most people speak at least a second language ; and therefore that we have at least somewhat decently educated citizens , 
  i certainly welcome that decision going the right way  people should be allowed to live beyond their job ... 
  yeah the suv drivers just got jalous haha, 
  yeah apparently it was a passional crime . 
  soap opera stuff irl ... : x, 
  why is it that all the psychos declare it 's jesus/god 's fault when they do something insane like attacking their own kids or wife ? 
  well then we need to defund them entirely & confiscate all the weapons & ammo we 're supplying them . 
  let 's see how long the malians last doing that kind of dickish move . 
  remind me , do n't we have an army deployed there ? 
  and are n't we keeping the alqaeda assholes out of their back ? 
  are n't we running their economy , military and half their gov ? 
  ... really ? 
  the embassy personnal have nothing better to do with their life ? 
   criticised an upcoming middle east peace conference organised by france , calling it a new `` dreyfus trial '' / r/nottheonion, 
  dailysabah lol . 
  it 's the turkish breitbart or dailymail equivalent, 
  damn . 
  wish her prompt recovery . 
  weather fitting the end of the year ha ; merry christmas, 
  ~ ~ not sure if balkans or games of thrones ~ ~ merry christmas, 
  yeah apparently they got rotten luck for christmas : - / talk about ending 2016 , another plane crash . 
  that said , regardless of that bad story ; happy ~ ~ christmas ~ ~ end of the year to russia too, 
  nice gesture , 
   i 'm more french than you are . 
  all my grand5 - parents are verifiably french , first things first ; that 's not how things work . 
  france is a culture , not a genetically inherited trait . 
   ancestor who at the age of 6 was spitting in the soup that was meant for the occupying prussian soldiers good for him ; now what did you do with your life ? 
   le pen is a breath of fresh air after the baby boom generation fucked us by blamming ~ ~ jews ~ ~ ~ ~ mexicans ~ ~ muslims for it ??? 
  do you even know what you vote for ? 
   i will be sending a message both times . 
  ah yes , the famous `` message '' idiots like you send by setting fire to the country like the joker . 
  super impressive . 
  thank you italy too !, 
  some greece-related good news , good , 
  apparently he was known , and was n't arrested because 1 \u00b0 ) at one point he went underground when he had a doubt 2 \u00b0 ) there was paperwork mistakes : /, 
  and so you think that justify disappearing the newspapers owners with a political international arrest warrant & foreclosing daily sabah , then ? 
  i saw similar articles on aleppo from large numbers of turkish newspapers . 
  do you interpretate to mean that the turkish press encourage suicide bombing ? 
   it is not a quote  '' * according to the statement * ''  '' * tak stressed * '', 
   and encourage lone wolf attacks . 
  [ source needed ], 
  are you serious . 
  they litterally quoted the tak claim . 
  does that mean that dailysabah is litterally hitler because they quoted nazis once or twice ? 
   can you please take a moment to read their articles ? 
  it is full of articles that describes pkk as `` freedom fighters '' and turks as `` invaders '' . 
  are you serious . 
  the headlines are half about hdp and there are n't a word about such . 
  hdp articles is probably why the interpol warrant was written . 
  hdp got mass arrested in turkey for speaking similar things . 
   pkk is older than akp . 
  they have been active for decades and the islamists are also older than 9/11 ; i know . 
  they did , however , made a convenient boogie-man to arrest opponents by the boatload . 
   this organization funnels through most of his funding through europe because it is simply `` freedom of speech '' . 
  this is ridiculous and baseless . 
  anf does not smuggle money nor fund anything . 
  they 're barely above water as it is . 
  you can call all opposition press `` terrorists '' if you want , that does not make it truth . 
   have you ever gone to their website and read the news ? 
  i did it for you . 
  first headline is commemorating `` pkk martyrs '' . 
  https://anfenglish.com/ where do you see `` pkk '' ? 
  please , by all means , make a screenshot and underline it . 
  i ca n't even see the word in a search . 
  furthermore , i feel compelled to point out that a lot of those recent attacks might have or have not been organized by mit ( turkish cia ) sleeper agents ; for the explicit goal of having a `` terrorist ennemy '' and concentrating all powers in erdogans ' hands . 
  the last attack was even simultaneous with the presentation of a law to give all unlimited executive powers to the turkish president to fight terrorism . 
  the timings are always a bit funny like that, 
   i am pretty sure you would arrest a guy who is publishing in favor of isis . 
  anf does not encourage neither support terrorism . 
  also , he was n't arrested because he was ~ ~ `` gullenist '' ~ ~ ~ ~ `` pkk '' ~ ~ but likely because they were too close from the hdp ( opposition political party of which members got mass disappeared by turkish police without a trace because they became too influent ) . 
  hum , it would be nice if we did n't arrested journalists just because turkey asked for it with forged political interpol warrants it might be slanted , but i do n't see how slanted press is worthy of an arrest warrant ( otherwise we might as well go arrest half the yellow press staff in europe ) erdogan 's trying to get us to eliminate his political opposition abroad & anybody calling him out for him, 
  well the bild is a known tabloid . 
  people referenced to it as the `` german daily mail '' ( even if that does not lessen the horror of that incident by any measure ; but they did n't wasted time on political recovery : / ), 
  at that point it 's just sad . 
   bottles with the lotion normally carry warnings stating they are not to be consumed , but correspondents say that the labels in this case said that the product contained ethyl alcohol rather than deadly methanol . 
  : / methanol poisoning  police earlier uncovered an illicit workshop where the lotion was being made , and arrested its owners . 
  and they got the culprits too ? 
  great, 
  this fear mongering is ridiculous and quite frankly a bit obscene . 
  greece got handed a bit of money to hand down to their poorest citizens so they have a christmas after 5 years of extreme belt tightening on the german 's finance ministry orders . 
  trying to seize it away just because you see 50 $ passing on greece 's main account is sheer open , unblinded raw greed . 
  this is the banksters trying to foreclose and seize your house on the 24 's night because they found somebody to buy it from them . 
  do n't you already have enough bloody money mr schaeuble that you need mugging the oldest and poorest out of their gifts at the year 's end ? 
  and if that happens , we should recover twice as much from the ~ ~ robber barons ~ ~ ~ ~ christmas stealing grinchs ~ ~ debt collectors bank accounts and hand it back to the greeks . 
   world peace . 
  nobel prize for trump well they did give it to kissinger so, 
  i can point at half your r_t_d posts for example . 
  do n't bother , i know you 're an ultranationalist . 
  oh look an `` alt right '' gun-nut `` ultranationalist '' the_donald voter from / pol / that want `` ultranationalist '' things the kind of people that in the southern us yell `` the south shall rise '' and wave a confederate flag , a gun and a bible wah , i 'm super impressed / s, 
  ihs jane 's is one of the reliable sources . 
   should n't we be pushing washington to bring turkey to account on these issues ? 
  yet nothing 's happening . '', 
  well ; with trump around the corner ... well ; maybe he 'll take muscovite orders to harass turkey . 
  the right action for the wrong reasons ? 
  who knows .
