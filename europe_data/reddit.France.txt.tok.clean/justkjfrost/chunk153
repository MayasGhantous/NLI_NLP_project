   the latter has removed 130,000 people across all walks of turkish life , from soldiers to lawyers , journalists , teachers , and health workers , many of whom are now incarcerated without seemingly any valid case against them . 
  more than that . 
  kurdish officials in the south also seem to be randomly disappeared by police , entire political parties like hdp have most members disappeared without explainations too , journos that contradict the official version get seized and reporter arrested , elections are rigged , likely false flag attacks ran by the mit , ...  `` the members of this alliance bear a huge responsibility to push back against authoritarianism and violations of human rights . '', 
  well ; do n't mind me , but we 've got kind of a political situation in washington too as i 'm sure you 've noticed ... 
   is nra sponsored lie no , nra sponsored propaganda . 
  but nice play on words  so are 2015 post-eugunban proposal czech firearm sales pretty much  statistics ( 50k guns instead of 15k in a normal year ) . 
  stop trying to smuggle weapons in . 
  r/frontnational is that way  _ , 
   after i advised the cops that i am armed so that they are not surprised ) . 
  lol ; you quote us procedure once again . 
   when i legally bought my two new semi-auto rifles this year no , i do n't believe you bought/carried those in czech republic . 
  i think you are a pr account to peddle nra interests in europe . 
  okay , i take it back . 
  the telegraph genuinely lost the clickbaity headline of the day ( but then that one might be true ) . 
  did n't your parents taught you that you should n't abuse drugs ? 
  are you seriously using the goddam sun as a source to tell me how we live in our country ? 
  xd and an isolated riot video ; wha , i 'm impressed . 
  saw 10x worse in london in 2011 . 
  guess it must be already a 4th world country !, 
  you 're posting complete nonsense . 
  the `` no go zones in france '' is an invention of foxnews like 2y ago that caused a lot of memes and laughing in france . 
  http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/nogozones.asp it 's likely somebody in murdoch 's staff trying to restart the rumor for whatever reason and the telegraph took the bait . 
  they realized after it was already on / r/worldnews and so they edited out 90 % of the article but did n't cut the title because it brings ad revenue . 
  this is straight up there with sarah palin 's `` obamacare are secret death pannels '', 
  ah , so it was `` no go zones hosting jihadi country '' then `` neighborhoods '' then `` bars '' then `` sevran '' again ( basically a neighborhood of `` greater paris '' ) . 
  lulz . 
  nonsense start visiting france before repeating blindly propaganda, 
  you realize you 're trying to convince me i 'm living in a `` jihadi wasteland country '' ? 
  lulz :d take your fear politics and throw them in a garbage bin . 
   yeah , jihad infested . 
  jihadi john and his buddies came from the uk . 
  so i guess we should rename london in `` ossama bin laden '' by that logic ? 
  or dublin into al qaeda ? 
  you 're an idiot mate . 
  there are no more so called `` no go zone '' in france than in the uk or ireland, 
   well yeah , pubs flying the union jack and orange flags it 's the same shit . 
  they found one random idiotic bar in a dungy corner and they declare it 's the same everywhere ...  wise , but do n't tell me that jihad infested ghettos wut ? 
  xd and i 'm pretty sure i can get the same kind of nose-in-the-glass talks in 2min by offhanding `` maybe the ira was doing something right '' and getting out and back with cameras, 
  lol ; 1 \u00b0 ) they found like 1 backward bar and that become `` the nogo zones country '' once again . 
  you know i can probably make the same kind of `` reportage '' in some corners of ireland by mentionning catholicism \\* hides under the table before the broken bottles \\* 2 \u00b0 ) the telegraph article originaly talked about `` banned & closed neighborhoods '' then they changed it to talk only about that bar ; which to me is proof they realized they just posted nonsense, 
  can you stop trying to twist facts to lie-pretend that `` the czech republic totally has a mass gun culture '' ? 
  this just make you look ridiculous, 
   it didi n't start in prague , it started in brussels . 
  `` what about bruxelles ! '', 
   ... is to prevent law abiding citizens ... do n't bother with the usual nra cut & past ...  so the aim is to preserve the current status quo no , the statut quo is a gun ban in europe . 
   just that in the czech republic it is , no . 
   and there are people who own tanks with fully working canons . 
  not in europe . 
   i would say that it is probably possible in france too just with more paperwork involved . 
  lulz you 're going to get yourself arrested . 
   or are you saying that all your private museums have just damaged inventory ? 
  museums have special exemptions , are heavily controled , and yes they have to make material non usable in a lot of cases . 
  tank driving rednecks also do n't qualify as `` museums '' no matter what lawyer you 'll try getting for that . 
  and no , self driving museum is not a thing either . 
   but the main impact is that once the eugunban is passed , czech authorities will not honor it . 
  in short , trying to undermine eu authorities , eu gun laws , and bring in more weapons in the area . 
  the only thing i 'm seeing is that russia is likely using the republicans ( who are themselves using the nra ) as a proxy to try arming people in europe to stir up some chaos . 
  you 're taking me for an idiot once again . 
  keep your damn guns out of my country and do not try to arm random ( nor chosen ones either ) citizens or it will be treated as a destabilization attempt . 
   no , those tanks were all demilitarized at one point . 
  they can be legally activated provided the gun is registered in your name with the atf and you pay a $ 200 tax and wait for approval . 
  well if it 's `` deactivated '' legally for 2 minutes , that does n't change anything in reality . 
   no actually that 's not true . 
  things like that have always been legal in the us since the day it was founded . 
  yeah right during wwii and some time after , driving a tank around in the us would have got you arrested faster than you can say `` second amendment '' . 
  all that really came only when the gop ended up in absolute power with reagan . 
   the nra had nothing to do with that . 
  yeah lol . 
  the 1934 amendement did n't include tanks because at the time nobody in their right mind would think the nra would give away old tanks to key members and some of their most wealthy patrons decades later . 
   in fact the nra supported the national firearms act , the largest gun control bill in our country . 
  `` the nra that disarmed it 's citizens '' . 
  i 'm not a lawyer so i ca n't figure out what the catch is , but from having had to tell them to fo a dozen time in the last 3 months ( because they insist on arming european citizens ) , i can tell you are taking me for an idiot . 
   from what i know there 's a large pin drilled through the barrel ( preventing a shell from being loaded ) and the breech is welded shut in addition to several other steps . 
  not impossible to undo , but it would take a lot of money and some professionals . 
  considering they do tank shooting competitions in texas in some quiet places , it 's pretty obvious that did n't stopped them one bit . 
   i 'm just telling you that tanks are n't illegal ( they 're even street legal in most places nationwide with just a few modifications to the tracks ) and there 's no smuggling of mbt 's or anything like that going on . 
  they got legalized after the nra ended up in bed with the republican party ; that 's what happened . 
  that allowed some of the nc oligarchs to legalize their private armies . 
  and now , they want to do the same in europe with likely the same amount of corruption . 
  i 'm sorry , but no , i do n't want any of that shit here . 
  let alone mass murderers driving ~ ~ makeshift killdozers ~ ~ real tanks around because they can get their hands on it . 
   tanks are n't illegal in the us , there 's no `` smuggling '' involved . 
  ah thanks the good old retroactive declaration and registration and legalization uh ? 
   they can be freely imported once the main gun has been demilitarized per atf regulations . 
  ah yes , totally disabled . 
  i 'm sure they ~ ~ told you they ~ ~ pulled the firing pin out of the autoloader and it 's insta ok .  the main guns can even be legally reactivated once they 're in country provided you register them as a title 2 destructive device with the atf 's nfa branch . 
  and there we go . 
  i 'm sorry , but in europe , no it 's not ok to have shotgun toting tank driving rednecks everywhere around . 
  if that 's your thing , stay in the damn us . 
  and stay out of the damn eu legal system . 
   isnt that a direct quote from the constitution ? 
  yes , a part written down by the group that later became the republicans . 
   also i doubt our politicians took direct quotes in english from the us constution that 's why i think the us 's own nra is trying to write it down . 
  they would . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_rifle_association ) they just ca n't fathom that europeans do n't want everyone to do groceries with a shotgun on the back like they do in the southern us and so regularly reinsist on the topic and rant that we should `` give guns freedom in europe otherwise it 's just a dictatorship waiting to happen '' or something like that . 
  which btw strikes me as out of place since it can hardly prevent a populist backed by a foreign hostile power to end up in power in the first place despite loosing any majority vote ( but hey you try to reason the gun nuts ) . 
  edit : yeah , looks like they opened an eu branch officially unrelated to the us nra mothership : https://firearms-united.com/ edit2 http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-gun-lobby-mobilizing-against-new-firearms-guns-weapons-rules/ politico thinks there is no connection because they deny connection to the us nra but lol . 
  i believe the current buzzword for that is `` hybrid warfare '' ( albeit i 'm just going to call it their old `` lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie and the naive idiots will believe you '' strategy ) edit  some eu officials complained about receiving emails with warnings about `` faceless and unelected eurocrats wanting to take our guns . '' that 's republicans talking like that alright . 
  just pointing out how that sentance is an nra obsession : http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/09/nra-admits-it-obama-really-hasn-t-had-opportunity-confiscate-guns/210842 http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/2016-gopers-claim-obama-and-clinton-want-take-all-guns-away http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/258285-obama-im-not-going-to-take-everyones-guns-away and basically the usual nra shoddy plot is as such : - acquire plenty of illegal weapons - distribute them to their supporters - pretend those are for hunting and `` self defense '' ( including , yes , that goddam t64 main battle tank they had smuggled in texas god knows how ) edit : and i 'm not joking , in the us they really are actually stashing battle tanks already : http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424127887324432004578302480951570270 probably to hunt ducks the dick cheney style i guess ? 
  if they get what they want in europe , it 's going to be their next step here too .
