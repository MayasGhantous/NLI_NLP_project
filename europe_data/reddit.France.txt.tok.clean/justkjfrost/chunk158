  it 's hard to have more nazi than that . 
  even they aknowledge their origin , albeit they pretend to have `` reformed '' and that the daugher of the founder ( marine ) is `` totally different and not like that '' ( but few people really buys it ) and there are regular scandals ( such as [ oven jokes ] ( http://lelab.europe1.fr/jean-marie-le-pen-ne-regrette-pas-sa-provocation-sur-michel-durafour-crematoire-14274 ) around open mics or [ annoying pictures ] ( http://media.meltybuzz.fr/article-793388-ajust_628/marine-le-pen-fait-un-salut-nazi.jpg ) or [ stuff like that ] ( http://md1.libe.com/photo/723793-kevin-reche-candidat-fn-nazi.jpg ) that leak from time to time ) . 
  their core voters generally argue `` that they are a necessary evil '' , not that the fn never was extreme radical right wing, 
  fillon 's a bit of a wildcard to be honest . 
  but he has some experience , so while we do n't know for sure what he plans to really , it 's likely he 'll follow some sort of coherent policy . 
  that said , as his former prime minister , he 's also known to have his fingers in sarkozy 's corruption pies . 
   hollande ran on a `` fuck merkel '' campaign nah , he ran on a `` fuck finance '' campaign . 
  and then did ( or let happen ) half of it secretly and scrapped the other half . 
  then did the mek/macro work laws . 
  \\  `` secretly '' \\  sends another batch of missiles to kaliningrad every months \\  desperately tries to produce ~ ~ shoddy a10 food ~ ~ t14 armata it 's pretty obvious they are re arming . 
  no secret i 'm afraid : x, 
  the pr certainly went a notch better , 
   same thing with ballistic missiles , they were used as conventional weapons in a multitude of conflicts  all russian military districts have iskander brigades , there is no particular concentration in kalingrad . 
  yeah apart that a lot of others simply do n't receive the budget or parts or iskanders . 
  the fact that a lot of ressources are prioritized in europe in kaliningrad tells me russia expect open conflict there and to have to use them . 
   their 152mm howitzers are nuclear capable . 
  lots of things are , are you provoked by those ? 
  as an alternative option . 
  not as their main intended use . 
   the missile brigade in kalingrad is getting new weapons because the old ones are being phased out . 
  and so they feel obligated to send a new batch of brand new high tech missiles every month in that corner while leaving all the usual bases in the mountains & ice to rot ? 
  right . 
  nice catch , 
   they can have nuclear weapons on whatever part of their territory they wish . 
  and so we can have shielding facilities in whatever part of our country we so choose . 
   you can not really know where the weapons are i assume governments can actually track them . 
   how should russia do this without provoking you , in your opinion ? 
  maybe they should disband the brigade ? 
  maybe they should stop proudly move what they repeatedly described as `` nuclear-capable missiles '' in kaliningrad while blasting it on the press and having for answer that ~ ~ `` read the fine print '' ~ ~ `` it does not break agreements '' : https://www.rt.com/news/iskander-missile-deployment-russia-317/  maybe they should disband the brigade ? 
  no but maybe stop sending so much weapons from mainland russia to kaliningrad would be nice  because keeping it in its current form can not be done forever . 
  well then maybe sending some of it back to mainland russia would be a nice gesture instead of sending always more iskanders to kaliningrad, 
   nobody is stockpiling weapons or mass destruction on your doorstep . 
  russian tactical nuclear weapons should be in central storage , not in units . 
  speculation floating around is that there is a major part of the live ( read : operational , non rusted away ) russian arsenal present in kaliningrad one way or another . 
  this is open provokation . 
  you tell me when 1/3 of murica 's arsenal is hanging in a single baltic state or all stashed on the tip of alaska . 
   can you explain how is it exactly provocative for russia to supply their units on their own territory with new hardware ? 
  oh yeah stockpiling mass destructions weapons on our doorstep in the middle of europe on the border instead of whatever base in siberia they came from . 
  how could that possibly be a provokation / s  if you keep adding stuff , the russians will want to add stuff as well , that 's logical . 
  the reason why we setup that shield installation in the first place is russia smuggling way too many stuff in kaliningrad . 
  we 're not going to play it `` cold war style '' because threathening to end all life on earth `` even more than you ! '', 
  is not going to work and did n't worked in the first place . 
  history has a knack of repeating itself , but maybe different actions will lead to different results . 
  on the bright side , short & middle term , i suspect replacing ships create plenty of jobs in the naval yards . 
  what i was saying is that the joke/urban legend is they agreed to swap the names of both to hold on their respective territory & control settlers flows ha . 
  `` greenland '' was an icerink while iceland was inhabitable, 
  [ ^ ( book religion then crash of the empire ? 
  ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_the_western_roman_empire#313.e2.80.93376:_abuse_of_power.2c_frontier_warfare.2c_and_rise_of_christianity ), 
  i see that the provocations continues ... 
  the us are the other way . 
  denying that the eu is a major power and using the us as an excuse against europe while waving more bombs against us is just gon na leave most european politicians more and more doubtfull about your arguments . 
  the us ' own missile shield is in us territory . 
  that one is * europe 's * . 
  and therefore localized in , you guess it , * europe * . 
  and no , it 's not going to go away by putting extra bombs on our doorstep . 
  if anything , that makes us want to add * extra capacity * . 
  if you want to annoy the us put stuff near bering or kamtchaka . 
  not in front of my country . 
  - neonationalism + post-factual post-neoconservatism, 
  yeah it must be strange compared to mexico 's everspring \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  it 's fars news linked media . 
  a series of propaganda agencies along the lines of sputniknews . 
  they 're unreliable , and ultra partisan that said they are mostly busy fighting isis and not antagonizing us lately so i 'm not complaining, 
  wow nice job . 
  i remember ms under steve ballmer was a company giving bribes like candy in europe . 
  they changed a lot ( for the better ! ), 
  under nadella , but glad they got caught anyway . 
  guess the romanian branch had trouble changing their habits ha, 
   i always thought it was funny that `` iceland '' had no winter snow this winter while over on the mainland europe they drowning in it was n't it the legend that iceland was named that way because it was lush and the settlers wanted to keep it to themselves and they wanted people to go to the other bigger unhinabited island after them ( which they hencefort named `` greenland '' ) ? 
   `` a portion of the funds will stay in romania and allow to create new jobs here , '' ciolos said . 
  yay , they could use it . 
   under the plan , the new apcs will replace romania 's tab vehicles , which are a locally built variant of the soviet-designed btr-70 and that mean they could even resell abroad the old btr they do n't use anymore to recoup some of their costs ... looks like that cooperation program might turn out well, 
  you say that but we do have a lot of refugees in france . 
  no i 'm not . 
  i 'm actually very serious . 
  the very * presence * of some form of government and the power it wields is the first guarantor of society . 
  wanting to entirely dismantle it is endangering it . 
  especially when it 's just an excuse to embezzle the nhs & disability survival money like in farage 's case . 
  edit : for the context , even revolutions generally aim to replace one government by some other form of government . 
  but i had n't met yet a revolution that did n't had at least a few leaders , some form of party ( ies ) , some form of economics & logistics , some form of police forces and/or military, 
  if that was true , nothing would prevent random joes from taking 5 buddies and rifles , walking in your home , shooting you and declare it was now his, 
  that look like a great decision to me ; and could be needed to maintain necessary utilities even when it 's not `` economically interesting '' ( \\* cough cough \\* flint , detroit \\* cough \\* ), 
  the only reason you think you can `` live without the government '' is because you never had to actually live without some form of government watching over in the first place . 
  the fact that most big occidental countries ( like canada , or obama 's america , france , australia , ... ) had to turn back on that logic and restart major so called `` government interference '' in affairs after catastrophic social consequences do tell us that it is pretty much needed, 
  i 'm not even english so i do n't . 
  but you 're going to be in for a surprize . 
  for example , `` private healthcare '' only actually bother delivering anything only because there is a working public nhs system . 
  the day that one is closed , your insurances premium will go up to several thousands per month for the same service while refusing to actually cover the day something happen ( because `` regulations in the way of business '' that forced them to actually insure people also got removed too since it 's `` government interference '' ) . 
  i know that , because i saw it happen in america first . 
  you 're headed straight for the same wall while thinking `` i got away with this ! '', 
  that 's the arrogance of a millionaire that think he 's set for life alright, 
   i do n't rely on the state for anything , what an absurd statement . 
  pray that you never need healthcare or retirement or police help or even to take public transports then ...  i will be alright regardless . 
  `` trouble only happen to the others . 
  it 's their fault ! '', 
  right ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  because when there is spending in any way shape or form , corrupt people with poor intentions will attempt to take the money in some manner at some point . 
  if they cut disability payments now , nothing tell you they wo n't cut utility subsidies in 10 years and then it 's your own bills that 'll twice being dismissive of the issues because you do n't see them personnally or are n't affected yet , with a `` it 's not the worst place in the world '' , only make them worse, 
   why would they convert in jail ? 
  hmmm he 's right that 's an interesting question ( do that count people converted in prison ?
