  it just does n't happen . 
  for comparison , i found you a chart about litteracy rates in imperial russia during the late czar/corpo feudal extreme right era , right before the soviet union : edit : even 1897 https://www.unzcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/russia-tsarist-literacy-and-current-iq.png even the capitals were * barely * at 40/50 % literacy rate . 
  the countryside was probably hovering at 15 % . 
  so odds are it 's just the whites lying about that data about estonia/latvia to justify the baltics ' independancy . 
  stalin was a complete bastard and almost as bad as hitler . 
  but i have to face that before him , it was even worse of a shithole . 
  let alone hitler 's plan to genocide all of eastern europe . 
  so i 'll stand by my idea that the * post stalin * era , the one without all the massacres , in the ussr was a noticable improvement . 
  the baltics have earned their freedom from russia , i 'm not denying that , but let 's not pretend for a second the earlier alternative was any bit better than stalin . 
  it was a political plague or end-of-all-human-life-in-the-area . 
  edit : typos , if reddit let me correct them one day without throwing errors or a blank page, 
   estonian `` era of silence '' was pretty mild and it was actually by a `` father knows best '' type of figure against the possible raise of nazis wait wat ; this is total bullshit . 
   in a very complex political situation with an aggressive and threatening dictatorship next door looking for an excuse to invade . 
  democracy had already been restored by the time of soviet invasion . 
  that is correct , for 1y . 
  but not long enough for anything to recover before stalin ( & hitler ) . 
   when it comes to literacy rate you can confirm it from a `` neoliberal '' russian imperial census of 1897 . 
  yeah there is no way there was even half that ( 40 % ) litteracy rates under the czar or similar lol . 
   as for the gdp per capita it is me posting info from `` the cambridge economic history of modern europe : volume 2 , 1870 to the present '' page 190 and you posting `` lol '' in the internet . 
  you still have n't quoted a number past stalin . 
  you still stop at 1939 , which was under him , while stalin was a bastard . 
  so instead of charging at open doors , please tell me from the after . 
   , too arrogant and too stubborn yeah sorry for stubbornly not endorsing nsdap dictatorships, 
   you 've just heard some bullshit soviet propaganda and believed it . 
  literacy rate of estonia was 91.2 % already in 1897 . 
  i heard probably a lot of propaganda true ; but there is no way that was truth lol . 
  not even remotely . 
   was higher than in finland , austria or italy and 84 % of that of france of couuuuuurseeee . 
  riiiiiiiight . 
  let 's conveniently ignore the fact that those numbers are a total invention spread by the fascist dictatorship that led your country in the `` pre '' nazi period known as `` the silent era '' that might or might not have been nsdap friendly : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/era_of_silence ( i bet they never taught you about that bit or in details ) then massively repeated by the now-republicans to help paint things against the ussr . 
   and overall backwardness and idiocy in economic matter throwing us into poverty and abysmal human rights situation . 
  under staline , i agree . 
  after ? 
  not so much . 
  standards went up as far as i know . 
   i am not going to write more now because you showed how absolutely ignorant ( and a fair bit arrogant in that ) probably , but not enough to drink so much neolib propaganda about fascists dictators either . 
  neocons were too busy whitewashing hitler , franco , greek junta , pinochet etc `` because at least he 's blocking the commies out '' . 
  that paid everyone back out soooo weeeelll . 
   then we were invaded and occupied by a cruel backward totalitarian regime that started mass murders , mass deportations , practical reintroduction of serfdom and overall backwardness and idiocy in economic matter throwing us into poverty and abysmal human rights situation . 
  then you quote stalin 's bs while conveniently ignoring my question about what happened after ( so like post 1955 ) . 
  yeah i 'd imagine haha ; just that the thought of having similar temps in * northern iceland * than on france 's southern coast on the mediterranean in nice was a surprizing one . 
  usually it 'd be like 40 \u00b0 c or 100 \u00b0 f of * difference * between both , a good one, 
  well i disagree with a lot of your answer but not the conclusion haha  well yes , but most people do n't make minimum wage , so raising the minimum wage does n't affect the majority of jobs . 
  actually that 's not quite true : - a lot of job were ( are still ? ), 
  genuinely paid legal minimum wage . 
  notably in service , delivery , and a lot of what is considered a `` job for youths who do n't need that thing called money '' . 
  - pushing the minimal wage mean other jobs get a rise too to ensure that people do n't stay at the new minimal ( because a lot of educated or tiring jobs would push people on other less tiring jobs with the now same pay ) . 
   but getting people going from no wages to bad wages is still a good thing for the time being i will have to argue it 's genuinely false , because in countries with a strong welfare system , it prevent from forcing people in jobs with conditions and pay too horrible and preventing them from leaving them with a threat of rapid homelessness . 
  that said with that current minimal wage at 825,65 $ per month it 's probably less bad than it used to be ( i remember reading regularly about spanish youths complaining about unlivable 200 $ wages ( in spain you ca n't live on 200 $ , you probably need 600 or 700 rent included ) for fake `` part time jobs '' ) . 
  water has been moving under that bridge since . 
  but i 'm still not buying the `` let 's remove the minimal wage it create jobs ! '' . 
   the government 's finances will get in order and hopefully enough to get back into spending on infrastructure again ( though also hopefully a bit more thought out than last time ) . 
  there are still some badly needed and expensive projects ( high speed to basque country , mediterranean corridor , and finishing the line to galicia/asturias ) . 
  i also think a high speed line between barcelona and the basque country should be built to solidify the economic triangle of spain . 
  let 's hope so , 
   note , that most new jobs added will be lower paying yeah but if we enforce the minimal wage this time it should ensure that despite that not too many people will end up screwed . 
  it legally ca n't go below the legal minimum ( ie where we drew the line ) . 
  so seeing it rise is , i assume , good . 
   realistically wage growth is about on par with inflation ( 1.6 % last year ) oh ok , 
  did wages rose tho in volume ? 
  edit : answering myself , the unemployment rate reduced itself by 3/4 % from 20 % to 16 . something , and the minimal wage was risen by 8 % : https://www.thelocal.es/20161202/spain-to-raise-minimum-wage-by-8-percent-in-2017 ( probably even better news than this gdp growth if not for the fact it at least confirms that rising wages does not cause depressions and does not kill most companies despite the naysayers ) while there could be a lot of undeclared hours or people having less hours , i think we can * probably * assume wages as a whole * probably * rose in the country . 
  which is good . 
  what the hell ? 
  is n't that some serious animal cruelty and legally punishable ?? 
   if you think that ussr was an improvement over pre-occupation state in eastern europe then you are very wrong . 
  i 'm honestly interested to learn if you have a comprehensive opinion comparing the pre occupation and post stalin eras . 
  i rarely had a complete opinion from somebody in the baltics ( or at least not a completely honest answer that did n't include some degree of fear and caution ) . 
  regarding stalin i know and agree that the guy was downright evil . 
  edit : and no , for the context , despite what could be my dumb apologism , i 'm not hoping in any manner to turn back the baltics to russia . 
  i 'm trying to look at the 60  90 historical period tho . 
  if there are lessons we can get from past mistakes , i might as well hear about them ... where did it all went wrong ? 
  my argument is going to sound fuckin cliche but to the extent of my knowledge and despite the fact it 'd trigger polish society if they heard me , the post-staline ussr was honestly a ridiculous improvement over the medieval era in eastern europe . 
  ** that does not however justify any of the massacres or some of the waves or political utter oppression , which where in my humble opinion , totally unacceptable . 
  ** but saying `` food was n't as diversified as in the us free markuuut free markuuut ! '', 
  when the generations before where routinely starved to death by their local barons or hung for taking ( or not giving enough ) grain might have been a bit hypocritic ... litteracy rates went from like 5-25 % depending from areas to 90 + % ( and , notably , accessible to both genders ) , medecine started being available , infrastructure like railways , surfaced roads or potable water or electrification happening , cars being distributed , mass housing projects in cities ... now the area that probably had it largely worse tho was likely romania under ceau\u0219escu , who stayed crazy the entire length and ran his country to the ground north korea style ... and yeah , north korea itself . 
  it 's not that we do n't care , it 's that since the civies already got mostly evac , we can only wait for firemen to stop it then rebuild whatever needs to be ... 
  there are already thousands of firemen and multiple water planes deployed to fight active forest fires in france, 
   `` i do n't drink ... wine '' https://68.media.tumblr.com/1a72be2e753c39b699cb802e1b86d93f/tumblr_inline_o55znvjh0f1qbdfh0_1280.gif, 
  impressive place ah , looks straight out of game of thrones or our medieval past ( wait , technically it did haha ), 
  tl ; dr : active participant in staline 's crimes  meri admitted to organizing the 1949 deportation of estonians from the island of hiiumaa , to the soviet gulag . 
  most of the deportees were women and children , of which , nearly a quarter died . 
  edit : yes i 'm hearing you people protesting that the ussr was n't just staline ; but i have to point out that if one wants to remember what the soviets did there are definitely better things and better people than staline 's gulag horrors & his camp managers . 
  i think those horrible crimes should be condamned regardless of other events later . 
  two big wrongs does not make a right . 
  wait , 26 \u00b0 c ( 79 \u00b0 f ) in northern iceland ? 
  damn , you can `` almost '' go to the beach at that t \u00b0, 
  okay that one is funny haha, 
   no explosive belts yeah i was surprized they did n't put an `` allahu ackbar '' in it somewhere haha  laughing soros is missing ^ ( handing them a few ~ ~ $ $ $ ~ ~ sorosbucks ^ ^ ^ ^ tm to protest you mean :d ) ^ ( the thunder in the back is a nice touch tho admittedly ), 
  looks like another tabloid spreading bs . 
  especially since whatever they had was mostly treatable without too much problems . 
  most modern day sicknesses in even africa or the middle east and any other country on the roads are known . 
  the one actual source of barely treatable diseases i 'm worried about is the ice melting tho ( due to the climate at least changing ) . 
  we already had that issue with anthrax ( ^ ^ all ^ ^ hail ^ ^ ciprofloxacine ) , who knows what kind of spore is in the ice of the glaciers even in europe itself , that has n't seen the sun since ( dozens of ? ), 
  even if the climate remains with acceptable temperature parameters , several areas precedently covered will be exposed within a few years . 
  so another risk of pandemic is something we should be aware off . 
  haha wtf . 
  well if it looks stupid but works , then maybe it 's not stupid,

  yup , and i 'm ashamed of that campaign our right wing pushed against `` polish plumbers '' . 
  fortunately poles have had a sense of humor,
