  and canada 's well working one or europe 's the proof of it . 
  the model is working . 
  the republicans fought to sabotage it the entire way . 
  except , in the us , they succeeded . 
   libertarian like milton friedmand and hayek argued for nit other similar policies . 
  have you read any friedman 's work ? 
  the state is pretty involved in many things . 
  no i did n't read it seriously . 
  however i can point out the libertarian 's party positions supports officially the `` trump '' tax plan which they rumoredly wrote via cato or heritage : https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/18/koch-brothers-support-trump-tax-plan/101810990/# which is essentially , in it 's current form , a near complete tax cut for the super wealthy : http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/22/news/economy/trump-budget-gift-to-rich/index.html which proceed by defunding basic services such as said healthcare ( in fact `` trump 's budget '' which is the gop 's budget let 's say ) rely on abolishing obamacare and defunding a lot of it at least to run . 
  then there are also all the other things it wanted to cut . 
  like the epa ( given to a coal executive that also recently legalized the use of chlorpyrifos sarin-derivated nerve gaz as a pesticide after a visit and 2m campaign contribution check from dow chemicals the industrialist producing it ; despite it having caused horrible brain damages in thousands of workers and neighbors btw ) . 
  the department of education . 
  usgs ( the ppl watching out for earthquakes , forest fires and hurricanes ) . 
  the coast guard . 
  medicaid . 
  disability benefits . 
  most of the state department . 
  the cdc ( the guys adressing pandemics like ebola ) . 
  food stamps . 
  etc etc. 
   who said the dnc is not pro business ? 
  stop it with the `` tu quoque '' wattaboutists lies would you . 
  no , the democratic party is n't pocketing billions in bribes yearly and advocate to rise the minimal wage , improving conditions and enforcing regulations . 
  it can not be compared . 
   glad you have a pro business president in france too . 
  supposedly the french state in the eussr is all out communist , by gop standards ( despite running a mixed economy blatantly inspired by the us in the 1950 ... ) . 
  we do have working universal healthcare and ( gasp ) free public education paid for by taxes and even welfare for the poorests and partly state ran utilities so that companies do n't `` forget '' to buy sprinklers & spareparts in powerplants to save a $ for the shareholders then bill 150x the cost to `` turn up a profit '' . 
   secondly it is not `` repeal healthcare '' . 
  it is repeal `` obamacare '' . 
  the replacement is n't intended to replace , but to push out most people toward `` cheaper skimpier plans '' that voluntarily does n't cover most necessary healthcare and are considered as `` out of network '' . 
  in essence ; it sabotage healthcare to make it unviable to then let them `` prove that state ran healthcare do n't work '' . 
  they are trying the same with the nhs in england , and plotted to encourage fillon to do the same in france . 
   because obamacare is expensive taxes are collected to ensure fair living standards . 
  the libertarians stand against that as a principe and want to abolish taxes and welfare and any state ran policy . 
  that 's what they mean by `` small government '' . 
  they consider that people should have to stand alone on their own or that they are `` lazy moochers that could strap their boots '' . 
  of course , i do n't expect ex trillionaires to be able to understand that people that are paid the new republican minimal wage of 7 $ in missouri can not afford healthcare at `` free market prices '' of several years of income at the first radio on their own . 
  which will , in fact , lead to large amounts of people dying . 
  so i personally went to insist with republican authorities on the topic . 
  again and again . 
  no answer . 
  24h later , one of their reps , mo brooks speaks in public : https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/republcan-congressman-mo-brooks-poor-people-no-healthcare-good-lives-subsidised-alabama-a7713371.html  only republicans have rich donors ? 
  this is n't just `` rich donors '' , this is * corporations * giving to the '' * pro business * '' party with the expectation in return of having clear policy favorising them . 
  no person can match the donation of corporations , which have incomes in the hundreds of billions and treasures chests sometimes in the trillions . 
  are n't people allowed to be republican ? 
  yes they are , but donating money to legalize bribery ( with the citizen united decision , pilling loophole upon loophole ) ; was legalizing corruption in exchange for the dismantlement of the nation 's system . 
  industrialists bribed the legal systems in all branches till they got that decision which they gave to the gop allowing the gop to ask for `` campaign contributions '' for themselves legally . 
  in return , the industrialists expect that the federal budget currently used for funding healthcare and pensions will be given to their own corporations in what they argue will be more `` supply side economics trickling down '' . 
  this is plain old mafia corruption . 
   can you show me piece of heritage meetings were they plot about stealing money ? 
  you have n't paid attention to their `` repeal healthcare '' plot did you ? 
  the one that makes daily headlines in the us since 6 months now ? 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/republican-party-quest-to-repeal-obamacare-on-verge-of-collapse/index.html you know why they want to do it ? 
  to offer tax breaks . 
  for `` supply side economics '' . 
  yup . 
   everyone donates wherever he likes . 
  nothing wrong with that that 's a flat lie . 
  corporations should n't be allowed to give billions to political parties , because it twists totally the political landscape which then start working exclusively for the biggest donator , ie corporations with almost unlimited amounts of money ( koch industries pulls officially 100 billions $ a year , and probably twice as much more off shore undeclared ) . 
  in return for all that cash they ask republicans to remove their taxes and reduce the minimal wage . 
   charles koch voted for liberal hillary koch industries bankroll libertarian and `` conservative '' thinktanks like heritage and cato that give all it 's cash to the gop , gop which funded trump and before that all the republican candidates . 
  so , even if it were to end up true , he still founded the gop as the current party it is , the one that adopted the tea party 's as it 's main plateform . 
  cato is also largely behind the trump decision to leave the paris accords , or to repeal the current healthcare system , feeding conservatives questionable articles like https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/obamacares-pre-existing-failure . 
   do you really think that conservatives gather in a dark room and plot about taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich because they hate the poor ? 
  well ; in the us , the heritage foundation is basically pretty much that . 
  not because they hate the poor but because they can steal that cash and get away with it and do n't give a shit about the poor . 
   do you really think that ? 
  after dozens of arrests for corruption , well , yeah . 
   you have a pretty biased view towards conservatives i must say . 
  they say that `` reality has a liberal bias '' , due to not all liberals being terminally corrupted by money in politics and koch giving the gop hundreds of millions of usd a year , ha . 
  edit : i mean , when you get a wikipedia entry dedicated to your corruption , you 're probably either koch or berlusconi but 100 % mafia either way at that point : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_activities_of_the_koch_brothers, 
  lol , i have n't watched moore documentaries since forever , those almost slipped from my mind . 
  no , i was talking about a mix of personnal experience and probably my own cultural background ( french politics played a large part in it i guess ; and the us is a very very right wing reflect of it ) . 
  traditionally in late politics in it the conservative reactionary wing is the right wing ( the one that preach `` the return to tradition and family values '' , that want to make the church a state religion and `` pro business '' that want to give all the cash to corporations and the wealthy and reduce welfare ) and the left wing is the one with the tolerant , equalitarian , pro employee plateform wanting higher wages . 
  the right wing is also famous lately for cracking down on work conditions , especially in the us where they tried multiple times to go extra harsh ( going as far as lowering the minimal wage in multiple republican states , trying to pass laws authorizing businesses to make workers work on sunday and unpaid etc , wanting to dismantle state-backed healthcare supposedly `` because it 's communism '' etc ) . 
   the canadian one is extremelly close to the gop . 
  lol ; you should hear how they ( gop ) think about canada as a `` socialist quasi communist country '' ( let alone trudeau who they called a `` cultural marxist '' ) when talking to each others in the us . 
   for some reason you seem to believe that right wing equals genocide projection if i ever saw it . 
  you decided that you hated `` the left '' because you blame the syriza gov / blackblock radical leftists for everything that is happening in greece and therefore extended it to all left wingers . 
  then shortly after you decided that `` leftwing = violence = golden dawn = nazism '' or something along those line and that to put everyone in the same bag with a huge cognitive dissonance/not caring . 
   yea because right wingers hate workers , democracy , liberalism , higher pay , decent conditions etc. 
  these evil right wing people wanting social decay and stuff . 
  i did n't say all right wing did ( albeit the us republicans do ; but in european politics the right wing is n't half as far gone yet ) . 
  i said `` nazism do '' . 
   can you please point me to the books or other sources that you read ? 
  i am really interested to see where did you get these ideas about conservatism from . 
  they are fascinating . 
  in large part experience from having to face `` neo '' nazis then the us ' own right wing times and times and times again and seeing it go increasingly ultraradical . 
  the fact is the soviets where some of the biggest help i encountered when the shit hit the fan with actual nazis ( or in other times when the republicans went too retarded ) so i do know the actual difference . 
  nazism is fringe right wing , and founded on racistic ultra reactionarist ultra radical murderous conservatism . 
  it 's ( pathologically psychopathic and insane ) base theory is that if it does n't look like you you must genocide it . 
  nazism hate by design concepts such as workers , democracy , liberalism , higher pay , decent conditions , minimal wages , social equality , progressivism , lack of religion or any other concept which is the founding basis of left wing politics . 
   saying `` this is nonsense '' is not an argument . 
  yes it is . 
  you can take a blue pen and declare it 's red , it 's just complete nonsense . 
  no matter how much you repeat it . 
  you declare that nazis and commies are the same thing . 
  i 'm pointing out this is total nonsense and there are no relations and that you are making shit up for face saving reason . 
  then you play the idiot that do n't understand . 
  not interested .
