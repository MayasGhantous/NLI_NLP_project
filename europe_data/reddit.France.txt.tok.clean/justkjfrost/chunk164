  this is nonsense . 
  i 'm not interested in that convo , sorry . 
   nazis were leftists to begin with . 
  that 's like the most nonsensical thing i heard in a long time . 
  pray tell , you think syriza and the golden dawn are the same thing ? 
  even if you twice it at 400 because you pick main cities only it 's still not 2000 $ / month of rent . 
  comparing incomes uncorrected for living costs is ridiculous . 
  you do n't pay ~ ~ 10 $ ~ ~ 7 $ for a carton of milk in poland . 
  edit : something to adress even , note2self, 
  those could be videos out of context for all i know , especially since they 're in a language i do n't talk and deciphering random youtube videos is pretty low on my priorities right now . 
  sorry , i will not take it as face value as `` the true face of the left '' especially in the middle of a disinformation campaign sponsored by 2 hostiles powers ( both russia & the republicans ) right now trying to frame leftists as `` the new nazis '' . 
  average income in tallin is what , 1000 $ ? 
  800 in romania ? 
  average rent in paris is more than 1000 $ / month . 
  it can reach 2000 $ / month for an average neighborhood . 
  `` wealthy '' ones can explode with several times more even . 
   in any major city but in suburbs you could find so . 
  tbh attacking tourists for walking by strikes me as retarded no matter what and has nothing to do with `` socialism '' . 
  if this is about working hours , maybe yelling at their boss ( or , god forbid / s , making an union and collectively negociating under threat of collective refusal of work , aka strike ) would be more efficient than going in hands with passerbies who have zero influence or responsability on the topic ... 
  prices are also a lot cheaper . 
  100/200 $ rents do n't really exist in western europe . 
  the picture should be corrected for living costs tbh . 
  edit : no i 'm not against rising wages of course . 
  what i mean is that in paris 2000 will get you as far as 500 $ in tallinn ; so using this as a `` poverty map '' ( or rather a map to start an east/west fight ) is disingenious . . 
  the interesting thing is that we caught wind of quite a many ahem , `` tourists agitators '' from a certain eastern block country , encouraging violence and posing as `` violent leftwingers ' '' , setting stuff on fire and tossing bricks throught shop windows to try to encourage a police crackdown . 
  i 'm not denying that there was violence , but a third party was certainly adding fuel to the social fire . 
  the fact that so many / r/t _ d posters also come here to say `` this is the true face of the left , please ban the left wing '' does tell me this is a coordinated operation and not just my paranoia speaking . 
  that escalated quickly, 
   remember , both roosevelt and hitler put people back to work , kick-started the economy , and built infrastructure on the bright side it means there is a roosvelt-like path to do it that does n't involve mass murder ( even if that racist could have spared us the japanese camps ... i 'm talking about fdr yes ), 
   maybe even more so considering that was one of the things that happened just after the great depression and just before ww2 ... ^ he 's got a point , that tip the path toward bad-things ^ ^ ^ ^ tm, 
   boris on a bike ^ on ^ a [ ^ cable ] ( http://www.classwarparty.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boris-cable.jpg ) ^ you ^ mean ^ ? 
  sorry i wrote that one for the crack . 
  when i write it ^ with ^ a ^ tone ^ up it 's a joke, 
  fascinating story, 
   farage does not . 
  to put it bluntly ; he certainly shat all over the eu, 
  haha, 
  ^ i kinda agree with that poster, 
   what kind of idiot sets fire to a volcano ? 
  ^ ( the answer probably lies in the question ), 
   where are you going with this ? 
  another right wing strongman regime ? 
  ironically they 're imitating current day russia right there, 
  ^ ( just do n't touch the floor and y 'll be ok ! ), 
   this is the same guy who said france 's colonisation of algeria was a ` barbaric crime against humanity ' . 
  he said this while running for president of france . 
  so given that , he must have meant it , and i really , really doubt he 's just some anti-africa racist or whatever . 
  ^ this ; the press has been repeatedly trying to make clickbaits by taking his words out of context , cutting out sentances and running away with it lately ; tssk tssk . 
   i wo n't even comment anything else other than , you 're a piece of shit adding extra insults to try to make it credible ; haha . 
  you got that one from the republican trolls right ? 
   go to kiev , make a change been there , done that  and critin delusion of yours it 's spelled `` cretin '' . 
  with a `` e '' . 
   what am i ? 
  you tell us , 
   old babushkas who went througg ww2 and post ww2 ussr are coming into our offices crying and begging for their fucking pension , because they have nothing to eat because they already ate their cat yes yes the european citizens are known to be so poor they eat their cats and joinging the eu will only impoverish them even more and cause them to eat more of their own pets and the average eu city is obviously the battle of stalingrad/siege of leningrad / s facepalm yes it happened historically from living memory . 
  no , joigning the eu wo n't cause it ; this is total nonsense  it 's a lot worse off than it was before maidan you mean the people shitholes of donetsk & luhansk ? 
  maybe if they did n't drove tanks throught their own houses they would n't have so many problems . 
  the collaborators that helped the russian invade their cities brought their own situation upon themselves . 
  not that there is anything we can do about it anyway . 
  even the free food aid we send is regularly stolen and resold by their oligarchs . 
   wana hear about what ukraine is like today ? 
  wana see a doctor who actually diagnoses you and not just fills out a paper ? 
  bring cash . 
  wana find a murderer or at least see some sort of police work , even just papers filled out ? 
  bring money . 
  and this is exactly why an anti corruption campaign is needed . 
  and it 's not the current kremlin that is in any position to enforce it since they try to use and spread mafia corruption as a mean of control . 
  cf all the shady ties with the republicans or yanukovich . 
   * plot twist * the cognitive dissonance showing in the alt reich is certainly pretty funny . 
  they do n't know which '' ( ( ( ( jooz ) ) ) '' they hate more . 
  we 're also really showing the example in europe too admittedly / s oh well at least the police is cracking down . 
  disclaimer : in theory they are ( now ) supposed by law to compensate if you do n't earn enough to make minimal wage with tips . 
  i do accusate restaurants of widespread fraud however and frequently simply not doing it . 
  which could also be solved by simply directly paying minimal wage .

  you sure you are n't confusing me with a the_donald poster ? 
  i assume you 're talking about a web browser ? 
  dunno , i can read my comment well enough using firefox , chrome , mozilla , redditisfun . 
  issue on your end i would assume ? 
   secondly ; i 've never personally worked in a restaurant or have known of a restaurant where an owner pockets tips . 
  lol i will challenge that one and just repost the article i stumbled on an hour ago that explains well my opinion because i 'm too lazy to write another wall of text again : https://www.thenation.com/article/213-hour-why-tipped-minimum-wage-has-go/  which you very obviously lack given that you live in france and not the us and do n't seem to understand how things actually work here . 
  the fact it did n't worked was a large part as to why i left back to france , actually . 
  any self-respecting and logical business owner would not do this because it would be suicide for their business , let alone that they 'll make far more profit by ensuring that their staff are happy , which will result in the staff staying on with the business and continuing to provide desirable service , which people will then talk about , which will then bring in more people . 
  so this is a self-fixing problem wherever it does happen yet walmart and amazon are still treating their employee like garbage while making a fortune ... 
  anyone that ever worked in those companies for any serious length of time will know immediately what i 'm talking about . 
   tldr ; you 're confused by the tipping system here and that 's what this is about at the end of the day . 
  i see that confusion all the time i will have to point out that the republicans maintain that confusion because it helps them keep a separate , lower `` tipped minimal wage '' while saying `` but the tips are just adding on top of the wage ! '' . 
  i 'm not sure it 's an honest argument actually . 
  i 'm not talking about severing those ; but current trade levels are insufficient for them to recover . 
  they could use a lot of additional trade with for example poland , germany , the baltics or hungaria/bulgaria/greece nearby . 
  and for that they 'd also need some extra factories and production/storage facilities ; renovating their ports ; their rail network , utility networks , telecoms , additional customers for their potential aggro surplus , antonov had a knack for chain producing cargo planes , they had mass production capabilities for trucks , etc. 
  there 's * a ton * of developpment potential if they have funding & additional trade partners . 
  it 's a win/win for everyone really . 
  it 's also stuff that the eu did in poland ( & some cash is already earmarked for it ) , so it 's possible to do the same with ukraine . 
  but ukraine still has a terrible corruption problem so that is holding back the funding currently ( if half the cash you hand is going to disappear immediately in the hands of the mafia you do n't hand it right now ) . 
   but the benefits of making way more money out weigh those minimal risks of uncertainty . 
  it 's not up to waitresses to take the risks with their income for their employer , sorry . 
  and i think ( know ) the `` trickle down '' is just a lie the republicans are using to loot the economy , so no i 'm not going to believe that either . 
  it 's obvious you believe in what you write , but sorry i ca n't help but think you are brainwashed in accepting lower wages for past you and other people in your past situation . 
  that seem like a terrible thing for me .
