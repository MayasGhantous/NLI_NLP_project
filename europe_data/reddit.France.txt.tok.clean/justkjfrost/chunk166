   if the individual does n't get enough tips to meet min wage , the employer has to cover that gap for all individuals . 
  and greeks businesses are supposed to pay their taxes honestly . 
  that never happen either . 
   waiters and bartenders make on average well above the min wage . 
  this map suggest it 's flatly false in states where there is a `` tipped minimal wage '' : https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/sw353031.png  they like the current system for that reason and because many of them report their full tips ( irs estimates 40 % of tips are unreported ) . 
  no they do n't , but i know i can count on the average republican supporter like you to pretend that being paid less is being paid more . 
   they file a bls greivance , which costs nothing . 
  and lead nowhere lol ; which is why there are now class action lawsuits on most chains . 
   do n't know about paranoia , but certianly ignorance of the issue . 
  or you are naive . 
  if employers can not pay you , they wo n't . 
   ask anyone in the us who works for tips if they wish to change the system . 
  well most i met wanted their paycheck not to be docked just as much as i did unsurprizingly ... 
  receiving 100 $ paychecks `` because you have tips anyway '' with $ 1000 of basic living expanses ( rent , food , utilities , insurances , ... ) is only fun for a month or two then get quickly old . 
   again , i find it amusing that every american here is telling you one thing , yet all the europeans are telling us why we are wrong . 
  if you do n't like tipping , do n't go out to eat in the us , canada , or mexico . 
  no one is forcing you . 
  that is dishonest ; you can tip all you want ; i 'm only attacking the fact that the tip being paid is used by many restaurant owners not to pay the federal minimal wage ( they dock the tip and more against your wage ) . 
   no , that is inaccurate . 
  they can offset the $ 2.13 per hour in some places , but only if you are making so much that it is irrelevant that is not true . 
  from personal experience , if the `` tipped minimal wage '' is 2 $ , you can only expect 2 $ / hour plus the occasional 10 $ / 20 $ a day or two per month . 
  you 're not going to make a living from that ; and this is exactly what i 'm attacking : the system is turning on it 's population and the current generation is forced into burger flipping mcjobs because there is nothing else and you think it 's normal not to pay them a living . 
  worse ; you 're pretending they 're `` well paid '' on top of it and invent creative excuses to `` back '' it up . 
   when i started working as a waiter , the minimum wage for tipped employees was $ 2.02 per hour 30 years ago ? 
  you know that with inflation that would be like 25-30 $ / hour now ? 
  i 'm not arguing in favor of banning tips , i 'm saying the employers should have to pay minimal wage anyway despite you being tipped . 
   no , there is no `` blue '' or `` red '' in this matter . 
  tipping is the standard practice in the whole country . 
  you 're misleading and dishonestly playing on words : https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/wagemap.png in the state in red on that map , the employer can dock most of your pay if you `` make enough '' tips ; they do n't have to pay a full minimal wage, 
   no , owners do not keep tips . 
  if they tried , the waistaff would file a lawsuit . 
  and how do they even pay the lawyers or prove they did n't received the tips the restaurant declared they got lol ? 
  but yes lawsuits are happening to some degree anyway , as is pointing out the link i added to my last post : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restaurant-chains-hit-with-wage-theft-lawsuits_us_59136869e4b0d928baa249b7 http://www.phillyemploymentlawyer.com/wage-theft-epidemic-restaurant-industry/ http://www.salon.com/2017/01/27/wage-and-labor-violations-flourished-at-restaurants-linked-to-trumps-labor-pick/  it is hard to get firm data on how much waters and waitresses make , becuase so much of the income is unreported funny yeah ? 
  i 'd bet the republicans encouraged to destroy that data to argue in favor of lowering the minimal wage ; but that 's probably just my paranoia talking . 
  oh wait , they 're actually lowering it already in several states : http://www.salon.com/2017/07/09/republicans-in-several-states-are-lowering-the-minimum-wage-yes-you-read-that-right/  this bbc article says the median income for a waiter in france is $ 2,000 per month . 
  the us equivalent is about $ 2,128 . 
  and on 2k $ / month in france ( not in paris ok but in a big city ) i could live like with 6/8k $ in california ( not bay area ) lol, 
   no , employers can not keep tips you keep ignoring willfully the elephant in the room , that the restaurant generally said you got tipped enough & in cash that they do n't have to pay you a month of income . 
  then pocket them anyway . 
  it 's pretty hard to prove it 's not true . 
  wage theft with tipping loopholes are widespread in restaurant businesses . 
  it 's like expecting a greek business to pay his taxes honestly . 
   as it is a national practice . 
  but most blue states enforce minimal wage nontheless . 
  people can tip you on top of your wage , but the restaurant owner in those is n't entitled to withold your pay `` because you got paid enough by tips already '' . 
  edit http://www.phillyemploymentlawyer.com/wage-theft-epidemic-restaurant-industry/ edit : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restaurant-chains-hit-with-wage-theft-lawsuits_us_59136869e4b0d928baa249b7, 
  your post history suggest you lived in florida , which enforce a minimal wage ( 5 $ ) even on `` tipped wages '' . 
  if you add tips on top of the minimal wage then yeah you can make extra cash . 
  but did you worked in a state where they did n't had to pay you beyond the tips ? 
   so you do n't know what at will employment means , huh ? 
  it is illegal to withhold tips from an employee , dumbass . 
  yet they do it because it 's so easy to do it . 
   yes , they do . 
  they literally make twice as much as french waiters . 
  you 're smoking lol . 
  whatever , you 're in your fantasy picture and it 's a waste of time . 
  i 'll just put you in ignore list  if france was a state it would be poorer than mississippi or louisiana , dumbass . 
   how is it hard to imagine in a restaurant with a decent amount of guests ? 
  i can assure you that the waiter probably earn loads more than the person actually making the food . 
  the only tip you 're going to get you is the one paid in cash . 
  the ones paid in cb ? 
  you 're never going to get them lol ; the owner pocket them from exp, 
  that 's quite rare because most pizza boys i knew of generally end up with more like 7 $ / hour tips included . 
   what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  are you trolling here ? 
  have you worked in the united states as a waiter ? 
  so now you know more about an american waiters economic situation than an american waiter ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  live halfway between france & california . 
  the state decided to enforce the minimal wage even on `` tipped jobs '' for a reason : because they were n't actually paid . 
   so now you know more about an american waiters economic situation than an american waiter ? 
  you 're not one lol  american waiters make twice as much as french waiters . 
  no they absolutely do n't in tipped states lol  american waiters on average make $ 20 + / hr that just does n't happen in red states lol ; it 's touching you remind me of the people that came from africa expecting a 100 ' 000 $ landfall just for entering italy . 
  you surely have heard tall tales but no tipped minimal wage only mean you earn less . 
   they are n't exempt from paying you , what the fuck . 
  actually they can pay you a `` tipped minimal wage '' which is like 2 $ / h and knowing that the average restaurant do n't declare additional hours and make you sign a like 18h/w contract you will have like 150 $ / month in reality . 
  and considering you need like 500 $ / month to live in the us in a red state you 're not going to get by on that lol . 
  it 's basically unpaid . 
  you 're better off leaving the state ( which people do ) . 
   if you do n't make minimum wage through tips then your employer has to make up the difference . 
  that 's cute ; most of the time they declare you have been tipped in cash and do n't pay it because it 's impossible to prove the restaurant is fucking you over . 
  inb4 `` it 's illegal '' ; obviously no you have never been there , never worked in a restaurant , let alone in a red state . 
  and no i came back to france initially because i could n't pay my bills and ended up priced out of the country due to at the time too many jobs with bullshit loopholes like that . 
  at the time i litterally could not pay the rent anymore . 
   that 's illegal no it 's not , you never have seen the `` at will employment '' states right ? 
   no , it 's because american waiters make significantly more through tips than french no they do n't , and if you ever visited the states where it 's a practice ( think arkansas , alabama or mississipi ) they invariably are thirdworld poor towns that are actually having worse infra than romania itself . 
  there might be a reason . 
  like the fact that having an entire economy built on not paying people a living tend to destroy the economy and cause massive depressions there . 
   once again it 's confirmed that you 've never been the us you 're hallucinating or you are a trump true-believer morron  which makes you an idiot . 
  repeating that i 'm an idiot will not turn `` trickle down '' lies into reality . 
   that 's illegal  they do n't have a two month turnover , you 're naive are you ? 
  maybe you should visit those states yourself one day . 
  the reason they always hire waiters is because people flee those jobs there after quickly realising they wo n't be paid so there is no point in doing them . 
  that only exist in the dreams of the `` trickle down '' `` supply side '' voters . 
  you ca n't make a living on a `` tipped job '' , period . 
  the excuse for their creation was `` oh well it 's for students and they live at their parents anyway so they only need pocket money '' . 
  same shit you hear for `` unpaid internships '' . 
  edit : to which i have to add that if people want to tip you they can anyway , but exempting the employer from having to pay you is just a bad joke . 
  only in red states you can convince people that by not paying them `` you will earn more '' / s, 
  lol @usual lie .
