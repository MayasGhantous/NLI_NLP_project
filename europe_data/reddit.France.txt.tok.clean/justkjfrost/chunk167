  that 's flatly not true . 
  that one is spread by restaurant owners & their lobbies ; because they like being exempted from having to pay the minimal wage in us red states . 
  `` they 're paid by the tips '' being the excuse they use to keep it that way and their waiters unpaid or paid like 100/month . 
  and that 's not counting restaurants where the owner pocket the tips too anyway ; or deduct from wages of their waiters/waitress the meals customers that ran away without paying ate to not pay them anyway . 
  wonder why they generally have 2 months turnover / s edit disclaimer : in theory they are ( now ) supposed by law to compensate if you do n't earn enough to make minimal wage with tips . 
  i do accusate restaurants of widespread fraud however and frequently simply not doing it . 
  which could also be solved by simply directly paying minimal wage . 
  well we should at least help them try to fit in the chapters ( criterias ) for that ; pointing them the right way ; at least for the eu < _ < as for nato proper ; i believe they ca n't currently join due to the invaded territories ? 
  ^ ( probably because in france the waiters must be paid by their employer and do n't have to beg for tips to eat ), 
  agreed !, 
   it used to be the left was libertarian uh , wat ? 
  from all the digging in my shitty memory , i have n't remembered any reference ever where dismantling welfare & sabotaging infrastructure to give all that money to the wealthy was a lefty thing . 
  sorry , that 's just not true . 
  go back peddling your lies to somebody else . 
   can anyone give me a tldr on soros ? 
  sure , he 's a liberal billionaire that liked to subsidy liberal causes such as free speech , dem-like left wing organizations , press investigations , helped refugee programs , language courses , universities , etc. 
  think a non radicalized left leaning koch that makes money but still vaguely care about the gen pop . 
  so of course the gop tried to drag in him in their own party/cabale ( because they 're the shady billionaire party ) and he told them off . 
  they have been consistently trying to vilify & bring him down since . 
   are you fucking insane ? 
  now the gop and united russia are collaborators ? 
  yup . 
  in part due to the hack of the rnc ( meaning the russians have plenty of dirt on the gop ) ; in part due to their collective hate of liberals . 
  you have n't paid much attention to the elections , right ? 
   / r/europe is a crazy , tinfoil-hatted place sometimes i wish . 
  :( because then i would n't have to worry about how much dirt putin has on trump . 
  amongs other things http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/euvsdisinfo/docs/disinformation_review_20-04-2016-en.pdf ctrl + f `` soros ''  of course you wont see ny times or independent report on it . 
  they are part of the same movement as soros ' . 
  yeah and of course eu briefings , all protestors and all the press are also on soros payroll / s shit , i should ask for my own sorosbucks ^ ^ ^ tm if that is the case, 
  apart that never happened . 
  edit : it 's a false info spreaded by russia : http://www.snopes.com/george-soros-bring-down-us/, 
   you 're the one moving the goal posts after your deflection to food stamps was rebuffed . 
  i 'm moving goal posts by not taking a mere `` try again `` as a valid argument ? 
   i 'm actually really interested in your delineation between free market and laissez-faire . 
  from my perspective both in the current ( post reagan ) us definitions are very right wing to fringe right wing ... 
  the old `` welfare capitalism '' of the 50 's ( with strong welfare , high employee-friendly protection laws , a high minimal wage that would be 22 $ in 2017 $ accounting for inflation ; high regulations of every aspects of corporations , and a very strong public service with tax-paid education , tax-paid universal single payer healthcare , taxpaid infrastructure , decent unemployment money , 2 months of paid leave a year , ... ) was the one that worked but reagan helped the gop murder it and replace it with `` trickle down '' looting , `` supply side economics '' of not paying your employees , mob-like ever-increasing `` privatization '' ( that 's a term for whenever a republican give state assets to whoever gave them the biggest contribution ) and that ideology of greed and the systematic dismantlement of welfare ( in the name of `` fighting black welfare queen '' that supposedly touch 50 $ she should n't ; while letting corporations corporations loot trillions in `` subsidy '' state money ) that has been doing nothing but wreck the economy since whenever `` true free market '' libertarian-republicans had their way . 
   from that perspective , no . 
  north carolina is n't a purely free market economy . 
  is it ` freer ' than others . 
  certainly . 
  however , that 's not the point of this discussion . 
  okay , you confirm what i was suspecting : you 're one of those radicals libertarians for who the `` real free market '' never existed and even say mississipi or missouri lowering minimal wage is n't going quite far enough and you 'll settle for nothing less than abolishment of all taxes and tax-paid public structures ( including schools , hospitals etc ) ? 
  edit ; oh , btw , did you ever heard about the little republican `` project somalia '' attempt to create one in 92 , or is it still a republican dirty secret ? 
  you literally said , word for word , quoting you : '' * forced to dig , free market , pick one * '' . 
  you were n't talking about `` laissez faire economics '' . 
  once again you are dodging . 
  unless you are implying that for example north carolina is n't a `` free market state '' by your definition . 
  you 're the one that is pretending that `` market economies do n't force people to dig '' ; well explain the mandatory ( unpaid ) work to get snap in some states then : http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article53894400.html and of course if you have no job ( not something most people have control upon ) you have to `` volunteer '' ( voluntold ) ( take unpaid work ) ( which generally amounts to cleaning or digging holes ) to keep them or no more food stamps . 
  how is that any better ? 
  haha good point, 
  you have n't seen some of the conditions to get unemployment or snap in some red states , right ? 
  ^ ( the irregular tiles trigger some ocd ), 
   what is everybody trying to tell you and what you fail to understand no , it 's not that i fail to understand , it 's that '' / u/magasilver '' is a probably-paid republican poster whose main job is spreading shit on r/the _ donald and a few other subs ; and / u/doesntsmelllikepalm was just making up excuses to post a barely disguised random foxnews rant on `` leftist liburalz '', 
  either that or the us conservatives are still sore he refuses to fund & help their shitty plans in the us . 
  some people took feuds & pettiness and elevated it to an art form in it 's own right . 
  gopers bankrolling attack ads against soros is probably not so surprizing tbh . 
  edit : and if anyone think i 'm exagerating , you have n't seen the attack ads campaigns they funded against obama : https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/obama-billboard.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all https://iusbvision.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/oembarrassed.jpg?w=800&amp;h=600 or hillary : http://www.dreuz.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clinton-cash-2-640x480.jpg https://cdn20.patchcdn.com/users/112920/20161004/033941/styles/t800x600/public/article_images/scream_a_geddon_clinton-1475609973-4449.jpg or even , wait , that one time they tried to frame george soros too : http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/24/montgomery-calls-attack-ads-against-him-soros-linked-group-violation-arizona-law/92699754/ edit : yup , confirmed , looks like that anti soros campaign is a republican/united russia cooperation : http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/george-soros-russia-republicans-214938, 
  damn , got ta admire the dedication to hating soros , lol, 
  post wwi it 's probably partly the fault of the shitty versailles treaty ( the authorities in france went completely cray & that pushed an already impoverished country over the edge if you asks me ) . 
  but yeah that guy certainly is earlier and had quite a bit of a psychopathic streak edit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide, 
  are you fuckin kidding me ? 
  the guy seized relief food from starving farmers to resell it literally saying `` it 's how the market works '' and you start a rant on `` the leftists '' ? 
  tbh i 'm suspecting some ( plenty of ) people came from afar to protest it . 
  but yeah , misinformation seems prevalent, 
  yeah that 's not quite right ... 
   5.56 nato out of an ak , who would 've thought . 
  ^ ( ppl that dropped their rifle in mud more than a couple time i 'd hazard ) albeit to be fair the hk416 the french army decided to pick recently do n't really have any jamming issues either :-p and it uses nato caliber , and it 's eu manufactured, 
  yeah , the papy boom . 
  and since the wages are all shit and welfare sabotaged , they ca n't afford to really help their family or pay retirement for the last generation either . 
  wow , that like another pioneer in the war crimes subject, 
   the netherlands is pumping 24/7 to remove excess water from low-lying areas . 
  we 're gon na have to steal those ideas for the rest of europe with the rising seas ah . 
  it 's interesting to see how the country managed to reclaim so much land and keep building below sea level, 
  a fish bridge ? 
  okay that one is new lol, 
  and here was the guy that gave hitler the idea about building concentration camps no ? 
  : / ( not personally , but he got copied ... ), 
  hey was n't that the guy that taught hitler about the concept of exterminating an entire ethnicity ? 
  ... we 're not even talking about just ireland here , we 're talking about the highlands . 
   because there was no free market the guy tried to seize the food supply & sell it for money while arguing `` it 's the market '' . 
  in the middle of a goddam famine . 
  then when he could n't , he forced them to dig and fill up trenches for nothing . 
  just because . 
  you can ignore the elephant in the room if you want , i have nothing to add . 
  the situation speaks for itself imho . 
  that has litterally nothing to do with the subject at hand . 
  the subject at hand was me pointing out that trevelyan forcing people to dig trenches 8h/day for 100g of bread in the middle of a famine `` because otherwise they would grow lazy '' while ranting ( paraphrasing ) about `` the hand of the free market '' is simply ideological dickishness - or him being a total dick - on his part , making the guy an ass ( especially since he openly did it just because he could get away with it since he was in a position of authority , with titles , backed by hundreds of armed men , and had all the relief food supply in his hands ) . 
   that sounds like it came from the soviet union bullshit . 
  when was the last time you heard the soviet union arguing that ( paraphrasing ) '' * the hand of the free market will feed those people , we should ban humanitarian aid and allow land owners to export all the dwindling food supply to make a buck anyway , because that 's the market * '' ? 
  oh , wait , never . 
  and that 's what the guy was saying . 
  the '' * let 's force those people to dig trenches then fill them all day for years to prove they are n't lazy freeloaders if they want 100g of bread * '' is also 100 % republican ideas . 
  you 're trying to displace the blame once again . 
  let me guess ? 
  potato famine ? 
  edit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sir_charles_trevelyan,_1st_baronet yup another winner that guy edit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highland_potato_famine#destitution_relief_.281847-1850.29  to encourage them to stand on their own feet , the ration was reduced ( e.g. 
  to 16 ounces ( 450 g ) per man ) , and it would only be given to those doing a full eight-hour day 's work  and the free hand of the market  the daily ration ( of oatmeal or indian meal ) was initially set by the central board at 24 ounces ( 680 g ) per man , 12 oz ( 340 g ) per woman and 8 oz ( 230 g ) per child . 
  [ c ] recipients were expected to work for their rations , leading to the building of `` destitution roads '' and other public works of little ( if any ) real value . 
   this `` destitution test '' , harsh in itself , implemented by victorian bureaucracy , and policed by officials used to enforcing naval discipline , engendered considerable hostility that mentality is just cancer . 
  but of course you can always count on some to use a famine and desperate circumstances to ram down the throat of everyone their truly glorious `` free market policy '' and victim blaming of `` lazy freeloaders that brought it upon themselves '' .
