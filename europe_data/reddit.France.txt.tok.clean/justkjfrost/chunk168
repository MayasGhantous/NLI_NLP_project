  what a bunch of aristocratic jackasses, 
  ah , yeah , i remember discovering about that one . 
  belgium congo ; probably one of the key reasons decolonization happened . 
  cutting limbs , flaying people and all kind of game of thrones habits . 
  ^ ( like the idea of that serie of `` colorfull '' characters tho haha ) edit more on the character https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_ii_of_belgium#exploitation.2c_atrocities.2c_and_death_toll, 
  now you 're just trolling me !, 
   it is not currently a forested area , that 's circular logic if there ever was one . 
  \\* groan \\* the fact is , it used to be a tropical jungle . 
  they cut enough it became a forest . 
  then they cut more and it became a plain . 
  then the desert expanded on it and it became more desert . 
  that 's deforestation leading to desertification , but hey if you want to play on words okay ... 
   as it is not a forested area ... 
  i know it 's hard for you to imagine , but * it used to be one . 
  * tchad , which recently illustrated itself on the topic , is a good example of the issue . 
  there is litterally the desert advancing on the forest . 
  if you are talking about the sahara , it is as big as it is now because things were largely deforested around it . 
  but it 's still in an amazing shape , tbh , for a building that old, 
  that is also a powerful picture . 
  in a good way . 
  ca n't help but find the whole thing pretty funny, 
  ... there are plenty of forests in europe ... what the hell are you talking about ? 
  did you ever travelled outside of italy and spain ?

  good decision from norway !, 
  uh what ? 
  sorry but that 's ridiculous compared to the desert in north africa or say the middle east or mongolia/gobi . 
  it 's absolutely not the most deforested area . 
  protecting our forests would be a good idea for long term prevention of desertification . 
  edit : with a pretty picture for a map it 's better https://imgur.com/a/tqhr4, 
  well it 's the company that falsified their emission and accounting sooo is anyone really surprized ? 
  ^ ( do n't worry , everytime we see the republicans we just drink another shot and find it ! ), 
   double irish with a dutch sandwich good point . 
  netherlands too ? 
  i certainly welcome this decision in favor of the customer ...  ( ^ ^ no ^ ^ no ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ totally ^ ^ not ^ ^ pissed ^ ^ at ^ ^ cancellation ^ ^ fees ), 
  quality trollin ' :d, 
  more funding for fundamental research & science , good , 
  arrest , prison sentance , then deportation ? 
  between you and i , what you say was frequently used in france as an excuse not to do anything in reality . 
  we had a serious problem in the french parliament of mps simply not working and pocketing multiple paycheks for basically fictious jobs ( cumuls de mandats + emplois fictifs/non effectu\u00e9s . 
  \\* waves at fillon & marine \\* . ) . 
  or people having like 4 political jobs including mp , local offices , mayorship , etc and doing only one . 
  that 's why i suspect that if they are serious there need to be a substitute fill in to attend that can brief them later or defend their position . 
  in most jobs if you missed more than a day or two you 'd get fired . 
  it 's sometime quite annoying to see that politicians can sometime get away with * showing up * once or twice a month . 
  he definitely has a point ; absenteism in politics is a serious problem and leading to more . 
  if officials ca n't attend themselves they should at least send somebody in their stake to represent the interests of their constituents . 
  and a second one , purfect , 
  excellent news , 
  wait , 20 \u00b0 c in northern finland ? 
  ouch haha, 
  hmmm . 
  maybe there is some way ( ^ that ^ is n't ^ abolishing ^ taxes ) to entice the industrialists to design more ( or even fully ) repairable devices with more available spare parts ; if only to reduce that `` throw away '' culture for electronics . 
  all in one things like tablets are probably some of the more egregious culprits lately . 
  there is a market and economic ecosystem on smartphone repairs tho thankfully . 
  ^ ( i believe they also suffer from a common sickness targeting the specie , known as `` rampant bank fraud '' . 
  really did a number on them . ), 
   `` french finally get something right . 
  taken about 2,000 years but they got there in the end . '', 
  ^ ( yeah we got that one from the americans , we 'll always try every options before picking the right one ), 
  beautiful place admittedly , 
   i 'm happy they put a eu flag over his casket agreed , without him , i do n't know whether things would have been the same in europe , at least as the eu . 
  or teargas, 
  balkans ? 
  balkans, 
  more seriously ; it 's rising year after year ... 
  by 40 \u00b0 c ? 
  how ? 
  xd did a shop empty it 's ice in the streets ? 
  edit op said a storm , meh , climate is going kray, 
   if your goal was to stir up drama , you should have chosen another photo ^ ( or pointed out that it almost looks like southern greece or france ), 
   there is a difference of mentality too . 
  western anglo-capitalism focuses on short-term profit and investor value , ( ... ) joint ventures of these large conglomerates are able to operate with losses for years , if the conglomerate decided that this is a business field they want to occupy . 
  that 's impossible in the west . 
  that 's not quite correct . 
  i do believe the sv succeeded because it took a more long term approach to research in fact , and not just * immediate * profit . 
  that said , there is a startup culture that is radically different than the `` chaebols '' system in asia , yes . 
  i think macron is trying a bit to import & reiplicate the startup culture , and that might actually be possible to be honest . 
  however we need to find a direction and make costly investments in fundamental research to keep the whole thing going , and we 're a bit in the dark at that point on the topic . 
   while far-eastern companies often take a long-term view of conquering market share the thing is , the american approach proved us that market share can ( might ) change quickly and radically if you have a truly better product and the support around it ( sales system , availabiliy , distribution networks , good pr , the needed publicity and partners to sell it , available spare parts and warranties , etc ) . 
  it does n't always happen , but it 's a very respectable possibility if the ground is set properly . 
  having modern semiconductors production capabilities & fundamental research in europe would probably go a long way . 
  the question is now `` where to ? '' . 
  ( between you and i , i would have hazarded space capabilities instead of just semi conductors , but the topic is still hotly debated along the lines of `` no , way too costly , not enough returns in the next few decades , it 's a money pit for the time being '' . 
  i 'd disagree , but i realize that short of mass printing & inflation we do n't have actually unlimited money ... ), 
  damn . 
  i never realized she was in the camps . 
  just missing a few palm trees , 
  good call !, 
   he has two accessory slots . 
  ^ ( always found that a bit lame when you can put one by finger technically in real life ), 
   why rings on both hands ? 
  ^ ( well you have two hands so might as well cumulate the bonuses ), 
   it 's weird to see how appreciated and admired napoleon is for the french and their leaders when he 's completely despised in other countries like mine . 
  he 's mostly admired by the upper classes because he was also generous with them ; but yeah we 're aware he kindah largely oppressed other countries . 
  tbh we also have a lot more positive figure recently with de gaulle ( albeit he also managed to get himself despised by the algerians i suspect ), 
   dude looks like the french president in a movie . 
  ^ ( well politics certainly integrate a lot of theatre and people making bad movies of the situation in their heads :d ), 
  proper satellite net ? 
   its not like they did it while working or did come drunk to work .
