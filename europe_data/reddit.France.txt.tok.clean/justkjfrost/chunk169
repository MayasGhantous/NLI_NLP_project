  well i think actually they were supposed to work on security preparations so if they went basically awol instead ... and , hey , from what i understand , they simply were removed from the mission , duh , it 's not like they faced actual complete firing or charges or anything . 
  they just picked other people that were n't still half shitfaced or hungover to hell to do the sec preps . 
  edit : my bad they say `` there might be consequences '' , but hey tbh it seems more about the removal from the sec team , and if they were drunk like that , it 's only appropriate ( plus waving your service weapon at that moment is probably a big no no ), 
  tbh if they had had the party after the g20 they 'd probably have gotten away with it :-p but they have to stay serious for the duration of the event, 
  the canard enchain\u00e9 is a highly sarcastic french newspaper that could come across as the nyt meets snl . 
  the news they post are almost always true ( bar mistakes ) and they are very well informed ; but you can always expect funny headlines and well pointed sarcasm . 
  they do n't necessarily report illegal stuff but love to point out hypocrisy in our gov. 
  that said generals taking joyrides in planes is probably low on the list right now haha . 
   hufs the fumes you sure this is just letters you were smoking right there ? 
  ^ ( i 'm sure we can somehow blame it on the polish or syrian yeah ), 
  ( your friend might or might not have been pulling a practical joke on you . 
  just * do n't * use any of those :d ), 
   russians did it . 
  likely . 
   is kronenbourg considered a bad beer in france ? 
  bluntly put , it 's probably watered down donkey piss haha, 
  give me 1 $ for each conspiracy theory involving cern ... :d but hey another country participating is extra funding for fundamental science research so welcome in fact , 
  ^ ( beware , i think you might have an outbreak of californian hipsters haha ), 
  haha :d, 
  the case was initially pushed by ms under steve ballmer ( who was a king of bribery , fud , dick moves and shady legal actions like that ) because he saw it as an easy way to fuck over another concurrent rather than develop a working search engine ; and now it 's rolling by itself . 
  to be fair satya nadella has taken the company in a radically different way since he was appointed ( a good one ) , but we 're still seeing the damage of earlier corporate warfare there ... 
  ^ ( sooo tell us , how it is really entering an eu area under shakira law ? 
  looks like foxnews was n't explicit enough ), 
  is it ? 
  apparently they want to force the engine to show on top results other price comparators ... tbh i think it 's bs but ... 
   i 'm always wary of billionaires who find it necessary to use the poorest in society as campaign targets . 
  generally means they 're stealing vast amounts of money < . <, 
   there 's a few things where the qe ca n't beat the degaulle . 
  we 've got a fucking nightclub aboard degaulle . 
  a french bakery . 
  and a bar . 
  and alcohol is allowed ( moderately ) . 
  game over . 
  give up , rosbeefs . 
  you 're screwed . 
  \\ ^ ^ ( came here to say this ), 
  i think people went a bit hard on may ( apart maybe on the whole dup alliance debacle & cuts & nhs cuts ) but quite frankly it 's hilarious haha, 
  ~ ~ `` i 'll be back '' ~ ~ ( joke apart it 's nice to see some still care about at least part of the situation like schwarzenegger pointing out climate issues ), 
  ( back to less dark topics ) great news , 
  but then i 'd have to get into a bribe bid war with murdoch and the guy or rather one of his backers would put on the table hundreds of billions of # and $ stolen from states coffers just to have the last word . 
  there are better uses for important ressources than buying conservative officials at that scale . 
  and we 'd have to do it for everything . 
  it 's probably better policy to fight off corruption and make it illegal to bribe officials . 
  edit : yes i know you were/he was joking and i answered semi sarcastically myself ... 
  `` we will abolish random laws '' makes litterally no sense to me . 
  it 's just madness . 
  his username is an obvious reference `` deus vult '' which is used as a `` meme '' spreaded ( no joke ) by russian intelligence to try to stir up / pol / and the_donald . 
  if you read his history , his opinions are also all talking points of russian kremlin-run pr agencies, 
  yeah he 's joking about tourism and people obviously stuck in massive traffic congestions haha, 
  ah  ^ ^ so , ^ ^ you ^ ^ mean ^ ^ the ^ ^ macedonia/fyrom ^ ^ border ^ ^ ? 
  ^ ^ kidding ^ ^ kidding, 
   '' the lesson will also cover chopping off limbs , stoning , caning , polygamy in islam , islamic interest , jihad , conquest ( of nonmuslim lands ) etc. 
  that 's how you create the next isis, 
  if this is true ; then it 's obvious turkey is heading back full speed to the dark age medieval era . 
   why do you hate women ? 
  he does n't . 
  he 's paid by russia to pretend he 's a pole to influence their opinion that way ( that `` all poles should hate women '' to help extremists in power ) in exchange for far right extremists secretly negociating with russia for electoral help & favors in return for sabotaging nato . 
  they posed as `` front national '' `` concerned voters '' just the same in france and started ranting on `` the jooz '' to help marine le pen 's nazis during french elections in return for her promizing she would attack nato if elected note that pis did the same using and payed the polish church to encourage populations to vote their way in exchange for attempting to pass foamingly radical fundamentalistic laws at the behest of local sunday hate preachers . 
   do you think poland will go full cesaucescu ? 
  that 's a risk actually being taken seriously in some circles , yes . 
  and right wing parties lately try to one up each other by being perpetually more extreme ... 
  poland , busy turning in a gop shithole one law at a time, 
  to be fair , that does n't account for any difference of prices . 
  i can get a week of housing in an hotel in ukraine for the price of a capuccino large size coffee on the champ \u00e9lys\u00e9es in paris . 
  sure i 'm taking extreme examples ( and with the cheapest and costlier parts of both countries ) ; but it 'd be nice to see such a map corrected for inflation one of those days !, 
   amsterdam tourist per inhabitant : ~ 20 ^ ( ~ ~ hey i got this from tropico , just put a big weed vendor in front of the airport and extra sale spots on your borders and that should help with the problem ~ ~ ), 
   in fact , in a recent poll barcelonians considered tourism the biggest problem of the city , bigger than unemployment . 
  source it 's almost as if it means spain should simply sell tourist visas or whatever for higher prices and use the money to fund your unemployment and infrastructure and investment ? 
  :p ^ ( i mean too many people that try to get in to burn all their money is generally seen as an opportunity for the country ) sounds to me like your tourism industry is mismanaged : o, 
  ~ ~ damn it just after the e3 , how the hell will i find time to play all those games : < :d ~ ~, 
   maybe what you really need is a pipeline . 
  came here to say this :d, 
  ~ ~ not jalous france proceeds to draw horns on both ~ ~, 
  i did n't knew spreading mass ignorance was the new cool thing  board of education chairman says subject is debatable , controversial and too complicated for students so is gravity ? 
  ~ ~ yeah you can now burn your monthly telecoms quotas in less than a minute ! ~ ~ :-p joke apart , once the tech is there , we 'll be in a better position to pressure prices down ~ ~ with margins below 99 % ~ ~ . 
  and it 's great to see it 's still progressing , 
  you are right , maybe it 's time to whistle the end of the school recess and for some corruption trials then . 
  the airline tickets we can probably disregard because it can reasonable be assumed to be work travel expanse . 
  base wages too . 
  that still leave a million stolen dollars floating . 
  on a semi unrelated manner , that does seem like a regular habit of late in politics there , yes .

  https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/9-arrested-for-online-payment-scams-in-joint-operation-polish-police-and-europol i see the country also have an anti corruption bureau . 
  https://cba.gov.pl/en/about-the-cba https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_anticorruption_bureau and i guess as relevant ressources , a semi updated case study ( 2015 ) might also be interesting http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/poland and of course the wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_poland http://www.againstcorruption.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wp-11-anti-corruption-in-poland-new.pdf further relevant https://publications.ceu.edu/sites/default/files/publications/fod-batko-toluc.pdf https://cba.gov.pl/en/news/166,requests-for-arrest-of-4-detained-persons-in-connection-to-the-reprivatization.html http://globalinvestigationsreview.com/article/1015026/eighteen-arrested-in-widening-polish-it-bribery-investigation http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kulczyk-poland-ciech-iduskcn0x30s5,

  ^ ^ and ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ how ^ ^ we ^ ^ sold ^ ^ 64 ^ ^ warplanes ^ ^ with ^ ^ working ^ ^ oxygen ^ ^ to ^ ^ the ^ ^ muricans ^ ^ for ^ ^ cheaper ^ ^ than ^ ^ a ^ ^ f35 ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ be ^ ^ seeing ^ ^ myself ^ ^ out ^ ( edit : tbh i was mostly joking and poking fun at gop embezzlment of funds , because there is still like a 20y technological gap between both in favor of the f35 and the f35 is partially radar stealthed and those planes are second hand vs a brand new plateform the f35 represent . 
  a more appropriate comparison if i was more honest there would be the rafale vs f35 . 
  a 30y old refurbished us-built a10 would also be many times cheaper than a french-built brand new rafale , obviously . ), 
  okay . 
  am i stupid or is it just the dm going in a full paranoid meltdown over a random drawing ? 
  ^ ( ~ ~ on the bright side tax evasion should be easier for him ~ ~ ), 
  ^ ( worse , looks like he 's talking back too ! ),

  msnbc suggests in an article that it 's still ongoing ; http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/portugal-forest-fires-39-dead-pm-calls-disaster-tragedy-n773736 2236 paris time maybe they could use some water bombers at that point ?

  a powerful moment and symbol .
