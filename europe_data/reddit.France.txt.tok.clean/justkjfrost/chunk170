  damn , that 's another big name and historical figure . 
   ukip voting behavior . 
  are we talking about the same guys with zero seats ? 
  yeah right ... ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  yeah , that 's why the netherland 's dike system is the subject of a lot of studies with the ocean rising , seeing how to apply it to other affected countries ... , 
  haha , 
  the russian-paid mercenary all bent on selling his country to the highest bidder that got zero seats in the election ? 
  if true , i hope the nego team will be merciless with him ... 
  he does not have the uk 's best interests in mind . 
  the more radical torries have their own twisted way of caring for the uk , but farage is just in for the chaos , political power and cash . 
  edit : just as a refresher : https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/31/farage-i-admire-putin https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/479532/nigel-farage-is-another-of-moscow-s-darlings-as-putin-backs-right https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-03/who-is-alexander-dugin-the-man-linking-putin-erdogan-and-trump, 
  more seriously , smh, 
   who is a long-term long term what ? 
  political troll selling himself to the highest bidder ? 
   farage has been advocating for brexit since forever . 
  farage has been funded by russia since likely quite a bit of time , trying to break the eu apart : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/12103602/america-to-investigate-russian-meddling-in-eu.html they also funded `` calexit '' : https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/12/13/from-his-home-in-russia-calexit-leader-plots-california-secession/ and cataluna 's exit : http://www.newsweek.com/moscow-opens-forum-texan-scottish-and-catalan-independence-501945 and likely scotland 's too : https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/754332/russia-spies-scotland-independence-referendum-aid-snp-claims-security-expert then of course you have the front national ( french nazi party ) ; afd in germany , vlaam 's belang , britain first , hungarian nazis trained by ru intelligence , ... basically any `` separatist '' in the us or eu gets russian funding . 
   murdoch has advocated for right-wing politics since forever . 
  and they 're gon na run into russians . 
  ru intelligence certainly has a love for fortuitous coincidences too . 
   but a russian showing up at some party with wealthy right-wingers just ai n't a smoking gun . 
  the fact that a number of his ventures ends up coincidentally frequently on a similar side riling up media support in the same sense is certainly troubling . 
  murdoch 's media outlets are right wing . 
  murdoch is `` right wing '' the same way the tea party are `` right wing '' and `` conservative '' the way you can see pictures and fluffy plushes of mammoths in the ice in a museum . 
  there are days where i suspect the guy is still mentally living before the victorian era and would sign with anyone that would `` drive back the damn liberals '' . 
  even if that mean selling the countries where he operates to the russians . 
   and the gop as a whole is n't particularly friendly to russia -- trump stands out because of the unusual positions he takes lol ; half the leadership of the gop are colluding with russian intelligence . 
  manafort ( a russian highlevel mobster that worked with yanukovich in sabotaging ukraine to let it get invaded by russia ) was one of trump 's closest advisors , he took russian money , sessions met them multiple times , roger stone too , page carter is basically a russian mafiosi too , steeve bannon 's breitbart is funded by it too , etc etc, 
   dup could demand nigel farage plays role in brexit negotiations was n't the guy utterly laughed out of the room by the voters , with his party obtaining a grand total of \\* \\ _ zero \\ _ \\* seats this election ? 
  it 's a little story about how [ farage ( a russian stooge ) , rupert and the son of one of the biggest russian mobsters meet in a garden ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/07/03/farage-murdoch-xlarge_trans_nvbqzqnjv4bqjdhzoku5ccgala2fvvreecqaql0ia9uido53pqqfgfs.jpg ) ... also http://www.reuters.com/article/murdoch-russia-idusl2e8e7hjn20120309 it 's also well known that fox helped coordinate propaganda campaigns on hillary and proping up the russian-backed gop while systematically undermining the obama administration . 
  in hindsight , one might also wonder whether russian hackers & intelligence did n't helped him in the past too : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/news_international_phone_hacking_scandal imho , the guy definitely has some form of pact or agreement with kremlin powers . 
  of course both sees the other party as the usefull idiot to get ride of later . 
  a temporary convenience alliance of sorts . 
  but they are in bed with murdoch who , obviously , utterly hates corbyn and do everything he can to sabotage him . 
   boris johnson vs. jeremy corbyn trump vs hillary round 2 if that ever happens , expect heavy russian meddling to demonize corbyn , and rupert murdoch to go onboard full steam against corbyn too ( i say that but he 's already going full fake news [ and having newspapers openly lying to frame him as an al qaeda jihadi ] ( https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yxgmirddfjgepuaj6wcldq--/yxbwawq9aglnagxhbmrlcjtzbt0xo3c9nzq0o2g9ndax/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fc5c2700ef6a1cf83f1dcb054a8052d9 ) a newspaper cover on two ), 
  yeah , i can see that a lot of people voted but are kindah scared by the dup , and not entirely without reasons . 
  sorry for the intrusion , but too many people going nervous in my back ( ca n't fault them with the situation ) . 
  many are comparing the english conservatives moving closer to the irish religious terrorists to stay around in power to the gop moving full tea party in the usa , and possibly not without reasons . 
  and i think i can see where they are coming from ; the problem is n't necessarily mrs may herself but that such a move could cause a lot more radical policies in the country down the line that could polarize it even more a couple elections down the line ( and lead to another us gop-like situation in england in a couple elections ) . 
  sorry if i 'm going to pass off as trolling or almost doing political recovery for the left , but in the mean time i 'd almost suggest that the torries could look at playing politics a bit more labour-friendly ( without necessarily having to cede power ) ; simply playing a bit more centric policies and convincing some labour mp to vouch their way in cases could probably do wonders . 
  also , i do n't really want to tackle the political question of current radical islamic terrorism because i 'm a bit too close from the question ( since i support the operations against isis ) ; but to be honest there are also a lot of people pointing out that the torries are re using the situation to try to crack down on freedom of speech on the internet with massive censorship attempts and i 'm kinda forced to point it out ( it 's also seriously costly for the torries too politically and pushing a lot of young and net-conscious voters to go labour instead ) . 
  other obvious contentious subjects pushing people to vote labour are the perpetual torry cuts ( esp to welfare/unemployment , which the right wing seem to perpetually hate beyond everything for some reasons ) , the massive austerity , and the nhs . 
  simply ceding some ground to the labour members on such topics could get probably some labour supporters to listen to the torries to help them secure majority too , without the torries having to systematically rely on radical ( crazy ? ), 
  minorities like the dup and their armed militant wing . 
  i will also assume that other less distasteful groups susceptible to tip the balance depending on the objective at hand might include lib dems or snp . 
  not live post by myself 'cause too lazy for that ; but if you speak french read here : http://www.20minutes.fr/elections/legislatives/2084215-20170611-direct-resultats-legislatives-2017-17h-taux-participation-4075-forte-baisse-rapport-2012 or english here http://www.france24.com/en/20170611-live-liveblog-france-follow-first-round-legislative-elections est 's from exit poll : abstention : 50 % : x from the voters that did vote : la r\u00e9publique en marche !, 
  ( macron 's party ) : 32.2 % les r\u00e9publicains ( right wing to far right , can be compared to the us republicans ) : 21.5 % national front ( extreme right to neonazis / lepen 's party ) 14 % france insoumise ( far left / melenchon 's ) 11 % socialist party ( hollande 's party , almost wiped due to widespread movements of voters to macron and melenchon ) 10.2 % greens 3 % ( ecologists ) communist party 3 % everything else ( minor parties ) if i know how to count 5.1 % since it 's only a partial poll / exit poll it 's bound to be off by a few % ; but should give you an idea of what to expect from results there is a second round which iirc involve the top 2 candidates in each sectors , in a week , if i remember correctly, 
  or simply they 're just totally out of the way between western/northern europe and meditteranea  and population replacement problems that one is complete fantasy . 
   one of the other members also took an axe to his own hand ( and chopped of one of his fingers ) because he was battling ` porn addiction ' . 
  master-race indeed !, 
  between them and isis we 're served ... 
  more nazi terrorists ? 
  yeah `` christian conservatism '' is becoming always more radicalized by the years as it 's biggest proponents are aging : / just look at poland with pis or the bible belt for prime examples ... 
   the quote does not express my personal views as you might guess from my user name glad to hear ; that said i got the feeling you are conflicted between loyalty to the gop that said `` metric is evil '' and knowing that the imperial measurement system is technically problematic  but is the official and published opinion of the wonderful us metric board that you are sure would have metricated us all if only evil president reagan had n't abolished them . 
  no , if the gop had n't sabotaged it the entire way along . 
  reagan mainly added the final bundles of firewood and dropped the starting match . 
   their track record of ineffectiveness and this official opinion pretty well demonstrate that they were put in place to prevent nationwide metrication , not cause it . 
  similar boards and acts got all of europe to switch to the metric system so let 's not pretend it 's impossible for a split second . 
  but magically the republicans decided to take that one into their hand and suddenly it fail spectacularly , mostly for having no budget and terrible peoples against metric measurements appointed at it 's helm . 
  gee i wonder how and why that could have happened / s  we should complete metrication and some industries ( including automotive ) did so voluntarily ( for their own reasons ) but congress has never had the backbone to develop a metrication plan for the nation the democrates dared arguing in favor of the metric system earlier . 
  that was enough to convince the gop to sabotage and burn it down to hell like everything else carter ( or more recently obama for the example ) recently did . 
   in 1995 , congress forbade the fhwa from requiring metric design and metric signage on federally funded highways . 
  so fhwa must , but must n't metricate . 
  good clear direction . 
  which was , yup , you get it , led by republicans . 
  edit : carter , not ford , sorry, 
   except democrats controlled the house in the 97th congress -- the ones that did n't budget the usmb . 
  another half truth to lie : budget was mostly written by the whitehouse and senate . 
  the majority in the house was also extremely tenuous , meaning the gop was exactly just as powerful and retarded as it is now . 
  reagan was pretty much trump software beta version . 
   however , facts should never interfere with a good rant . 
  do n't let me contradict you there / s  `` there is no national mandate to convert to the metric system no apart that the entire planet use another standard but only the us are using an extremely obscure imperial-era system and have to translate everytime they are speaking to someone else elsewhere . 
  not even counting all the scientific disasters it caused on a regular basis because the us scientists have trouble understanding why not everyone count in onces and gallons and inches and yards . 
   carter made most of the `` opposing sides '' nominees which left the usmb a band of warring tribes , and congress had never given it a clear mandate . 
  oh look another partial truth to hide a lie : the metric move was written by ford ( a republican president ) and abolished by reagan ( the republican radical ayaltollah that turned the right wing gop into the y' all-qaeda it is nowaday ) . 
  carter did n't intervene on it in any serious measure . 
  gop quasi filibustered their own act on that one , again . 
  this is extremely similar to the republican sabotage of healthcare at every turn that tried to blame obama for it . 
  it 's just a pile of dishonesty , slanders , lie , hypocrisy , partisan hackery that goes as far as borderline treason rather than concede anything to a democrate . 
  talking about alternative facts and reality . 
  perfectly . 
  i 'm used to people trying to make me look like crazy , like you are currently trying without much success . 
  you do n't know how to read ? 
  yanukovich was in ukraine . 
  pis is in poland and just as corrupt . 
  romania is a third country just as corrupt ( albeit with a dna working over time there ) . 
  yes , the post commie countries are frequently led by gold plating fucks . 
  they 're called oligarchs . 
  wrong again . 
  the picture i linked above came from yanukovich 's home , because it 's the most well known . 
  and yes , it 's coming from ukraine , a post commie country . 
  i suspect i could probably also make similar picture in the home of some pis officials in poland , and a few romanian ones . 
  probably enough for several * dozen millions * laptops and still have 3/4 of the money . 
  so no , i do n't think we should be going against the guy that buy a laptop , that 's retarded . 
  again , that statement is dumb . 
  you 're essentially saying `` they bought pencils and notebooks and paper !, 
  it 's the proof that packaging had nothing to do with innovation ! '', 
  of course people are going to spend a bit on money on that . 
  you know what they also have ? 
  food , clothing , electricity , running water , room furniture such as chairs and tables , and all other kind of shit needed for a citizen to actually work every days in a developed country . 
  now regarding the use of funds , you can either harass the guy that bought a table and a laptop and some food , or you can instead look up the guy that is litterally gold plating 2cm deep everything in his office and home .
