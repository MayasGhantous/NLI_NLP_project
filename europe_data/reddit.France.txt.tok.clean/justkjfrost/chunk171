  when the protestors broke in yanukovich 's home , i do n't think it 's `` laptops '' they [ noticed first ] ( https://static3.businessinsider.com/image/530b50da6bb3f72e6f5fdb5b/the-25-most-ridiculous-photos-from-the-homes-of-ukrainian-government-officials.jpg ) . 
  and i do n't think it 's what ruin the funds either compared to the hundreds of billions of $ floating in nature somewhere stolen every year by corrupt officials . 
  blamming the poorests and a few workers getting a bit of welfare as `` lazy profiteers '' is open framing of the wrong persons and you 're participating in it . 
   nothing pushes forward the innovation better than a self-employed person buying a new laptop . 
  and because i had to adress that idiotic statement , a laptop is as indispensable nowaday than paper and pens where 100y ago . 
  you ca n't do anything research related without them , or anything important either in a lot of country really . 
  so yes , those funds are actually well spent , and yes , good luck starting a modern tech or similar startup ( the only profitable sector nowaday ) without a laptop . 
  no , spending a few hundreds bucks on that is not a mark of corruption or wealth . 
  you remind me of those old idiots retired at 50y on the porch of their house now worth more than million $ that say that having a smartphone is a `` proof you have it easy '' to kids who work 70 + h/week @ 3 $ `` tipped minimal wage '' . 
   * congress had given the metric board zero budget so they could n't even meet , do anything , or pay staffers blocking the budget to an agency or spending line to say `` see !, 
  it ca n't work ! '', 
  is truly a stapple of reagan 's sabotage of the us government ( especially with welfare ) . 
   * half the people appointed to it were opponents to metrication see also pruitt ( a legal troll paid by oil companies who spent decade attempting full time to get justice to dissolve the epa for fictious charges with endless bullshit trials one after another ) appointed to the helm at the epa , devos appointed to education , a neo nazi ( bannon ) appointed as second to the president and jeff session , a kkk member who want to abolish us justice in it 's current form , appointed ag . 
   saying wtf and abolishing it were reasonable actions wtf ? 
  that 's like saying trump wanting to abolish the education , energy , environmental and diplomacy ( state ) department is a `` reasonable thing '' because they got defunded and do n't work properly anymore . 
  sorry but that 's republican sabotage and alternative reality , not ours . 
   the tories will win a landslide majority . 
  i expect them to have more than 100 seats more than all than all the other parties combined . 
  \\ -  exit poll : con : 314 lab : 266 snp : 34 ldem : 14 . 
  hung parliament < _ < \\  _ \\  looks like you might have been wrong . 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ but ^ ^ i ^ ^ had ^ ^ to ^ ^ rub ^ ^ it ^ ^ in ^ ^ a ^ ^ bit ^ ^ :d, 
  that 's a lot of money . 
  edit  number of german banks that participated in the presumably illegal deals : 40  banks and funds around the world alleged to have taken part in these activities : more than 100  amount of money that 7 banks and funds have thus far paid back : about 1,000,000,000 $ ( 1 billion ) that 's only a fraction of it , but that does confirm they 're onto something , that money is real and really missing . 
   the usa converted to metric in 1975 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metric_conversion_act hahahaha \\* proceeds to read a bit \\*  the metrification board was abolished in 1982 by president ronald reagan , and of course it had to be reagan !, 
  ^ ( who else could play a cartoon villain to that extent :d ), 
  ^ ( hey , maybe we should offer one of those to murica ), 
   s mass murder of the local fauna too ridiculous . 
  we 're not australia , we have a stable ecosystem in france since centuries in regard to cats  but i always found funny the hypocrisy of being so triggered by a kitty 's death there 's a difference between 1 and 200 and almost poisoning kids too -_-  their number should absolutely be cut down fuck off , no we do n't need people to justify mass murdering pets , using poison like that nor asses like you finding creative excuses to justify gratuitous cruelty, 
   why are flats in london 's hippest neighbourhoods being sold exclusively to over-55s , even as the young people who hang out there struggle to afford housing ? 
  because people over 55 are the only one who had regular paycheks in their lives , unlike most youth nowadays . 
  ridiculously small wages , lack of pay protection , `` unpaid internships '' and drastic removal of welfare for decades . 
  mass murdering household animals and people 's pets is n't `` pest control '' . 
  at best it 's animal cruelty . 
  animal cruelty charges ? 
   wtf does 200 cat do in a village ? 
  considering even rural villages have thousands of inhabitants and large amounts of farmers ( with grain & food that attract rodents ) ; it 's not that surprizing if one on 10 has a cat and there are some savage ones too . 
  yeah and here i was thinking `` why did n't we put sauron 's eye on top ? 
  smh, 
  ~ ~ [ how about that one with a blessed shield ] ( https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euobs-media/a1b286d54ac0a02fe767abb9bb5cf961.jpg ) ~ ~, 
  i hear you , but that would n't be the first architects to copy it for a building, 
  why am i not surprized . 
  backers of savage independantism pushing propaganda on the net . 
  who else to remove the us artificially from the top and put random eu cities haha nice find, 
  the decorum looks pretty funny , whoever designed it had a good sense of humor haha . 
  that said they did avoid the lavish needless displays of gold of past times , which is nice . 
  maybe they 're onto something ha, 
  that would seem very surprizing to me . 
  there is always something going on there . 
  to be fair the lack of nyc in that list is suspicious ( the second us capital is a hotbed for international organizations ) , even if i should n't complain that the french capital is # 1 :-p, 
  that really depends the provider you are talking about . 
  some are still trying to charge per kib of data like we still were in 1960 . 
   get a foreign sim the non overcharge over the roaming ( for the moment iirc ) only works if you spend at least 6 months a year in the country the sim is coming from ; otherwise they can overcharge you iirc, 
   executive overreach yeah obama did the same in the us and that was the scream :d http://people.com/celebrity/president-obama-pens-tyler-sullivan-absence-note/, 
  yes and no , costs of mobile net are still high in several countries ; and there are still grey areas without network . 
  should n't complain about widespread `` free '' ( taxpaid ) internet :-p ( and yes it 's a great idea :d ), 
   interesting how pro-eu melenchon supporters are ( fi ) yup . 
  talking against the eu is litterally why so many of his usual voters went to melenchon in numbers enough for him to loose the election, 
  mainly if you 're a pretty lady i 'm afraid : , 
  ^ ( and do n't forget to bow to the english if you 're an american ), 
  that 's probably why there is no french word for `` impossible '' ; we had to borrow from the american banksters for that, 
  damn i knew us education was in the gutter , but digging your european history manual in a garbage bin ? 
  good catch !, 
  yeah not having a 30 % obesity rate and 20y olds in mobility scooters does help building a country . 
  such as selling your arse to russian oligarchs ? 
  haha, 
  you ai n't going to go far in the us with a 4k yearly income lol . 
  that might cover you 3/4 months of rents and utilities in most red states . 
  for the food you 're gon na have to try a bit harder . 
  gratitude wo n't feed you , make sure to get rubles or something . 
  is n't that what the freemarketers taught us ? 
  do n't forget to ask for your money on the way out, 
  a flat pile of lies to justify invasions, 
   he also said he is shocked because trump 's decision on withdrawal from paris treaty . 
  but that 's actually reasonable , admittedly, 
  erh . 
  no , in democracies , opposition figures criticizing a government , is not a declaration of war on the country , nor an excuse to declare a war or attack people , i 'm sorry . 
  the fact it 's a supranational currency is very usefull because it can be seen as a bulwark against ultra inflation . 
  on the other hand , the problem remains that some states have a lot of it and others like greece have none ( nor can print any ) . 
  cash transferts or maybe printing allowances should be considered tbh to allow those countries to try to refinance themselves if only for running day to day operations without more crippling , destroying debts . 
  big projects will even be needed at some point to restart the economy and employ large amounts of people . 
  some sort of new gold ( ^ ^ cough , ^ ^ platinum , ^ ^ cough ) rush . 
  hey looks nice  ^ ( a scene to shamelessly copy for a ressort one day ), 
  color me surprized . 
  or not . 
  the most ironic bit is that if he had n't invaded ukraine nor hacked us elections , nato would be in sleepy mode at that point . 
  he forced a reaction . 
   there is no planet b  what about mars ? 
  still , it would n't change radically the environmental situation on earth :-p but yeah one does not preclude the other, 
  this is a great idea yes . 
  glad to hear, 
  agreed with the article and more broadly the headline . 
  unified tax systems and cash transferts will likely be needed to unify the eu, 
  ahah , not this time :d, 
  one of the big us gop conservative talking heads on tv/radio in the us . 
   to the point where the public opinion shifts to `` why arent we friends '' again . 
  cough cough [ ann coulter ] ( https://twitter.com/anncoulter/status/869074858805800960 ) cough cough, 
  i 'm curious , because i 'm not sure what the results will be tbh . 
   the tories will win a landslide majority . 
  i expect them to have more than 100 seats more than all than all the other parties combined . 
  do you have any elements backing that up , or is it just an educated guess/feeling ; or a lot of wishmaking for your dear torry officials to crush their rivals ?
