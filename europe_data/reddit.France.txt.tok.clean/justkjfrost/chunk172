  many prognostics give the tories a serious lead , but 100 seats more than everything else ? 
  edit : tbh there are chances you 're right ah , we 'll see .

  i did n't ask/have no solid evidence , but no i do n't think the figaro cut it . 
  they 're a right wing but genuinely independant newspaper acting on their own , not state owned media . 
  it 's possible he did got questions early tho . 
  a lot of officials are known to try to do that . 
  regarding your second point , ... russian views of recent events ... are frequently at odds with what us westerners view as common wisdom , yes . 
  but then if putin decided to deny the war in ukraine and claim crimea as russian , those are his own words , they are n't doctored . 
   this interview is obviously forged no , they posted a related article on their own website ( in french ) ; and the language on the article short is quite similar to the one on op 's article ( '' * you are frightening yourself [ for no real reasons ] * '' ) so i guess the content is the same : http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2017/05/30/01003-20170530artfig00379-vladimir-poutine-au-figaro-sur-la-russie-vous-vous-effrayez-vous-memes.php, 
   those pompous libraries seem really weird to me . 
  during the medieval ages , libraries used to be owned by the wealthy and elite only , who gold plated everything like that ( just look at trump tower and you 'll understand what i mean ) . 
  they just left most of the old ornaments ( except maybe some of the gold ) `` as in '' , i would hazard . 
   there 's no tables , seats , aisles or anything there likely is , just out of the picture, 
   waiting for the library of the r/europe mods obviously : http://i.imgur.com/jooewjv.jpg, 
  i guess old libraries still always have that impressive feeling because you never knew what kind of forgotten knowledge and lore could be hiding in it 's endless pages, 
  haha, 
  ^ ( that 's still a bigger airforce than some eu countries ), 
  ^ ( oh , i should n't say `` czechia '' ? 
  damn , sorryyy ) ^ ( * promptly hides all the paperwork mentionning it that 'll never get corrected anyway * ), 
  no specific questions , thank you for your comment !, 
  to be fair , both candidates are bearable ( as a french watching from the eu side ) . 
  on the annoying side , the torries have that cut cut cut habit with welfare and the nhs that is doing some serious social damage ( such as handicaped people left without income or people left without public healthcare to push them on private insurances trying to dump then flame up prices us style ; retirement & unemployment going the way of the dodo to extinction , etc ) . 
  oh and rupert murdoch is obviously weasling in back to power via the torries . 
  corbyn also has an isolationist streak in regards to the eu or midle east that could also be damaging ( i do n't think isis will stand down if we leave them in their corner so i heartily disagree with him there ) . 
  on the bright side , his mere presence keep the blairites out ( quite a number of them being either hardliner radical torries with labour cards , and/or 9/11 era war criminals ) . 
  the greens are also interesting , but they do n't seem to have much support there . 
  ukip are radicals , but they are doa ( dead on arrival , politically wiped out ) now that brexit is a thing . 
  snp has support in scotland , but is almost a one issue wonder too . 
  i 'm reading there is a `` liberal democrats '' and `` democratists unionists '' party that has some minor support too , but i 'm unfamiliar with them admittedly . 
  edit stupid versioning editing bug that ate part of my post , rewrote it quickly, 
   brzezinski argued against the 2003 invasion of iraq , later calling president george w. bush foreign policy `` catastrophic '' . 
  [ 6 ] brzezinski was a leading critic of the george w. bush administration 's conduct of the war on terror . 
  in 2004 , brzezinski wrote the choice , which expanded upon the grand chessboard but sharply criticized george w. bush 's foreign policy . 
  he defended the book the israel lobby and u.s. foreign policy and was an outspoken critic of the 2003 invasion of iraq . 
  [ 34 ]  in august 2007 , brzezinski endorsed democratic presidential candidate barack obama . 
  he stated that obama `` recognizes that the challenge is a new face , a new sense of direction , a new definition of america 's role in the world . '', 
  change of hearth ? 
  admittedly he 's an interesting dude . 
  i do n't quite know what to make of it . 
  still reading edit : my bad , it does appear he had a similar reasonable line under carter too . 
  the guy apparently was n't a radical , unlike what the headline tries to hint . 
  edit ; on the other hand ; looks like he did collude in that giant afghanistan fuckup  * when asked if he regretted supporting islamist groups in their fight against the soviet union , brzezinski replied , `` what was more important to the history of the world ? 
  the taliban or the collapse of the soviet empire ? 
  some stirred-up muslims or the liberation of central europe and the end of the cold war ? '' *  '' he further noted : `` the soviet union at the time was actively engaged in helping international terrorism , the irony was obviously lost on him . 
  on one hand he looks like he repeatedly supported unscrupulous terrorism `` against leftists/liburalz '' , on the other he did appeared capable of reading ( hearing out ) , and signing peaceful agreements a number of times . 
  not entirely coherent , and hard to picture , but maybe not wholy as evil as some of the reaganists i 'd hazard . 
  infowars is ran by alexjones which is on rt.com 's ( russia today 's ) payroll . 
  and foxnews has ran full propaganda tv in their crusade against the dem party : /, 
  smh ( maybe somebody ought to call the pm and tell him this is just trump being trump , and not to take it personally ? 
   that 's where we are as a country right now ... or so the foreign bot army wants you to believe my estimate is that 2/3 of the `` the_donald '' posters are foreign and never lived in the us , nor have any interest in doing so . 
  has he lost his mind ? 
  so have the gov train specific gov-validated moderate preachers to replace all the hate preachers in front of the same crowd ? 
  now it means we might have to arrest radical preachers & kick them out and close the more radical mosques and/or replace preachers with more moderate , government trained/validated ones . 
  amongst other things . 
  as a side note , looking at the stability of the crimean muslims ( despite the ru invasion & stalin 's abuses 70y ago should i add ) tells me that what the preachers preach as obviously a lot of influence on social stability and openness . 
  those guys took punchs without flinching several times and only see violence as a last resort ( and honestly i 'm kindah impressed by the way they integrated in modern society ) . 
  the opposite of the more radical elements we have to fight regularly during terror attacks . 
  that however is something that needs to stop . 
  and they need to de radicalize their religious brand . 
   but i am putting forward the assertion that public perception matters greatly right now and the eu is dropping the ball . 
  no it 's not , and if you run propaganda campaigns built on lies like brexit it 's not brussels fault . 
   if things like the syrian civil war continue to happen . 
  you think we do n't know that and did n't tried repeatedly to end it ? 
  why the fuck do you think we deployed so many men to fight isis & trying to nego a cease fire between saa & fsa ? 
  but course there are always the smartasses going all `` oh but we could just end it '' . 
  well guess what , no . 
  edit : just like there was n't any real `` stop wwii option '' in the middle of the war . 
  isis ' self avowed endgame goal if they could reach it is to start a nuclear holocaust on earth . 
  not exactly the kind of thing there is anything to negociate anything with . 
  and destroying them sadly takes plenty of time . 
  now is not the moment for you to play the `` immigrant islamists '' card or i 'm going to start being very insulting what with manchester . 
  but brussels funded his stupid wall years ago and have n't really pressured him on the topic so he 's kinda inventing to play the victims of forced immigration exactly to get people to vote for him & as a distraction for all the stolen cash . 
  ^ ( wait , the sun is visible in london now ? 
   the eu and some member states do n't agree with hungary on immigration . 
  the immigration question is a convenient excuse , but it is far from being the main ( or even an actual ) issue between bruxelles and fidesz . 
  corruption , closing down newspapers and schools and generally colluding with russia is , however . 
   can somebody , in short , explain why the government is n't satisfied with the eu ? 
  basically hungary is accused of suppressing press , centralizing power in orban 's hands , oppressing political opponents , running largescale anti eu propaganda campaigns to please russia , stealing large amounts of funds ( we 're talking 8 figs here ) ; and probably taking russian money . 
  and closing down any ngo vaguely critical ( or non slouching enough ) , including several popular big schools/universities . 
  apparently many people are happy of anti corruption campaigns in romania , pissed at their situation in hungary closeby , and want the same kind of clean up in hungary ( which fidesz - orban 's party - oppose , because a lot of their personnal are stealing money and generally plenty corrupt and want to keep their corruption habits ) . 
  not going to complain about people waving eu flags and complaining about corruption , obviously :-p but we did n't started the protests in the first place , to adress the obvious question in the room, 
   vote may , get murdoch should be the claim that 's pretty much the implication of the joke for anyone that followed : http://mediastorage-lls.bauermedia.co.uk/91/10ad1/1c2e7/ddcff/63da0/30049/0ffe9/lily-allen-farage-murdoch_620x349.jpg?1467633404, 
  haha, 
   trump also has his own cult of personality separate from the republican political religion . 
  the part you need to understand tho is that he did n't organized it in the first place ; even if again he does n't see the creepy issue with it . 
  pretty sure a group i 'll just nickname `` kekers '' ( after their `` kek '' frog meme on 4chan ; possibly a partly rogue cell tied to the gop party and neo nazi `` alt right '' ) for the lack a straight up name , started it using russians to post on 4chan as an initial propaganda delivery plateform . 
  then they spreaded it to reddit & other medias with bot accounts . 
  the same radicals + kremlin connection is obviously behind the fake macron leaks http://www.politico.eu/article/neo-nazi-activist-may-be-behind-fake-macron-documents/, 
  glad to agree there , 
  why ? 
  the greek should want the ( greek ) eu ambassador to attend . 
  how else are they going to observe so easily and so close the current turkish state of the art ? 
  wait , was it said by trump or iohannis ?

  ^ ( not sure it 's covered by my us insurance ; it 's probably going to be a pre existing condition now ) ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  there 's a difference between blindly trusting a single article written by bbc and having a variety of sources on a topic . 
  also , i do n't really have time to dig that specific case ; but in a general manner the insane `` if you ca n't pay your bills you 're just lazy just do n't be poor/sick / ... '' accusation used to cover up the lack of job and wage theft in southern countries ( or in the us ) is increasingly annoying .
