  itt people trying to normalize the party where member are routinely [ shaving their head and doing hitlerian salutes ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/politique/694664-20110325-politique-cantonales-candidat-fn-faisant-salut-nazi-suspendu ) . 
  or maybe you are full of bad faith and he twisted words to conveniently distance himself from the campaign once he was proven a total liar, 
   a campaign he was n't a part of [ ooooof couuuuuuuurse ] ( http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2016/05/26/nigel-farage-brexit.jpg ) [ oh , you mean the nhs ? 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cbngaspxiame3fe.png ), 
  . . did you even watched the video ? 
   farage was n't even in the campaign that said that . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnqr1fdk8qi, 
  well repeat that partial truth as much as you want and make your own decision as a country . 
  what do you think about that [ `` millions for the nhs '' truck ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/nigel-farage-350-million-pledge-to-fund-the-nhs-was-a-mistake/ ) btw ? 
  honestly i ca n't really stop you from shooting your own foot and saying it does n't hurt despite knowing it 's not quite exact ... 
  of course . 
  but if they stop paying what they owe us , we have to stop building their roads , stop funding their utilities , stop paying their farmer subsidies , their doctors , proping up the city , ... edit relevant bbc article that explains brexit in the big lines for new comers http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887, 
   he would just do what the current european leader do , help usa to destabilize middle east and selling weapons . 
  commonly repeated propaganda . 
  no , the current usa are n't trying to destabilize the me , and most of the last deliveries to our proxies there were free btw . 
  the main thing we 're currently fighting in the area is daesh , which is a lot more destabilizing . 
   thats why hollande supports him so badly and many other no , holland supports him also a lot because marine is the head of the nazi party . 
   why the censur if its not real ? 
  another untruth . 
  in the run up to the vote it 's illegal to do defamation action like that ; it can come out after whatever vote ; but a good 20 % of those emails are doctored  either way le pen or macron both are equally bad another lie . 
  one is the head of the actual french nazi party , the other a simple right winger like maybe david cameron ( if he had worked 8y in banks ), 
   it was more a general statement ( it uses the `` pr\u00e9sent de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale '' ) in my opinion . 
  a more correct translation would be : no , it was more than likely intentionally a lie . 
  the / r/france sub is spammed by pro-fn anti-macron foreign propaganda since 6 months . 
   if the statement was about this particular case he would have said `` ont ajout\u00e9 '' ( past tense instead of present ) no , not necessarily . 
  `` ajoutent '' is simply simply an ongoing , currenty happening action except it does n't translate properly ( `` are currently still adding false documents '' ) but clearly states `` it is happening '' , full stop . 
  no `` if '' , no `` buts '' , no `` might '' or `` could '' . 
  you are mischaracterizing/mistranslating . 
  they are saying there are fake documents inserted in it ; not that there `` could be '' . 
   `` ceux qui font circuler ces documents ajoutent \u00e0 des documents authentiques nombre de faux documents afin de semer le doute et la d\u00e9sinformation '' , expliquent l\u2019\u00e9quipe `` those who are circulating those documents added a number of falsified documents to the real ones , to sow < uncertainty/confusion/doubt  and disinformation '' ; explained the campaign team, 
   a senior goldman employee without an offshore account ? 
  i honestly do n't believe that for a second . 
  but he brought back several millions in france which would fit for what kind of position he had . 
  that does n't account for the obvious perks and payments in nature ofc that helped him making it to a ministry which in turn helped him turning himself into presidential material . 
  and by `` senior , '' the guy `` only '' worked for ~ ~ 10y ~ ~ 8y or so in the banking sector . 
  compared to all the dinosaurs that spent half their life playing with it he 's a kid ... edit https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/emmanuel_macron#banquier_d.27affaires 8y . 
  yes he 's obviously groomed as an adopted rotschild . 
  no , that does not make him a * senior * banker ( you have ppl with 80 + y experience there ) . 
  more a junior associate forking to politics . 
   the fact that they are ` leaked ' now pretty much guarantees there is nothing of note in them . 
  they 've been releasing fake upon fake on him those last few days . 
  the fn made a fake pdf file for example supposedly `` proving '' he had off shore account in the bahamas [ and forgot to merge/delete the photoshop picture layers ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/69f1r4/macron_offshore_account_4chan_trolls_forgot_to/ ) . 
  fake which they waved/mentionned at the presidential debate like if it were real ... then they made [ fake threathening sms to play victim and posted the mspainted `` screenshot '' on twitter ] ( http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/grand-est/marne/reims-metropole/reims/florian-philippot-diffuse-fake-news-twitter-bousculade-organisee-reims-1247559.html ) . 
  then now they release a mix of fake email hiding in useless ones to try to manufacture outrage . 
   it 's obviously a joke . 
  great  that could go a long way in shoring the economy, 
  tbh , i do n't think that 's currently possible . 
  it can be reduced , sure , probably by even 10-15 % ( youth ; 5 % avg including older workers ? ), 
  ( it 's currently at 42 % for the youth , and 23 % avg iirc ) , but to reach the eu average ( 7.5 % ? ), 
  money would have to stop hemorrhaging out of the country that fast . 
   and the inclusion of jaroslaw kaczynski in the ranks of ` le pen 's friends who break numerous freedoms ' is improper and highly unsuitable . '', 
  once again , pis is not sorry for their actions but for getting caught & called out ...  _ , 
  i 'm not sure they realize she 's basically pushing ldpr-like policy ... 
  corrupt politician stealing from a corrupt politician !, 
  for a change !, 
  lol ; if you think even some melenchon ( basically ideologically a quasi soviet from the 60 's ) voters will vote marine lepen ( head of the nazi party , no exageration . ), 
  you are smoking something mighty powerfull that graph has probably low understanding of french politics . 
  she likely wo n't go above 20 % total ; and once you remove abstention 30 % of the rest at best . 
  there is probably 1/3 of the country that hates her , and a good half of it that could n't give a fuck about her, 
  well , it looks like an evil ^ ^ ( er ) bigben :d, 
  it 's not very surprizing : - the saudis have a lot more and more easily available oil , which the gop buys in bulk - the iranians are closer to russia - the gop is responsible for making the iranian original republic fall and appointing a blood thirsty bastard ( the shah ; to try to get to iranian oil too ) which was so bad the islamists replacing him was at the time an upgrade ( they did later crank up the hangings and murders too tho ... ), 
  that would n't adress radicals coming from pakistan or who got kicked out of more moderate countries like morrocco tho . 
  that kind of problem needs to generally be solved at the source . 
  doing it in our countries is only adressing the symptoms . 
  that however is a serious concern , because saudi 's arabia 's teaching brand of imams are regularly radicals when they come back in europe . 
  i 'm not entirely sure why . 
  and to be honest it 's probably nocive for saudi arabia too , because their more religious extremists are holding back their country ( and probably even limitating the royal family there to be honest ) . 
  in the end , the better-working solution would be that the saudi look into how deradicalizing their own preachers and religious teachers to be honest . 
  < _ < \\  _ \\  ^ ( so , was he greek or macedonian ? ), 
  et refuse de discuter d\u2019un coup de pouce sur la dette avant ses \u00e9lections l\u00e9gislatives , \u00e0 l\u2019automne so if understand the article right , it 's basically hinting the situation is back where it was a year or two ago : the greek gov point out they need debt alleviating , the imf somewhat agree , germany refuses to agree to anything , nor even really want to talk on the subject , and want to order them an even bigger surplus ( likely because they still want to enforce impossible conditions to the country to force them out of the eurozone ) . 
   would you rather i say he was n't lying , but he was incompetent ? 
  that he went into negotiations , dragging a whole country in shit because he had no idea how that thing works ? 
  tbh , i know a bit of the other side of the coin there : - the reason as you pointed out the situation `` is n't that bad it 's not third world '' and that pensions are paid ( despite 90 % of the tax base not having been paying taxes for the last 20y ) is because they actually got some of the money you mentionned . 
  however , due to ernormous german pressure , none of it was mentionned in public . 
  ( and because whenever debt collectors got any wind of any money in the accounts , they 'd rather grab it than let pensions and wages go throught . 
  that 's obviously a problem is n't it ? ), 
  - regarding the printing and defaulting , it was the reverse : as i understand , they were threats to be used if they were kicked out of the eu as schaeuble wanted to force them out . 
  ( `` if you force cut them from the market and embargo we will dedup 200b worth of banknotes and use them to settle their debts '' ) to give the greek gov a bit of leverage back  and when he found out how it works , that greece was certain to lose , what did he do ? 
  he asked people to vote on a plan that was off the table anyway ah , yes , i remember that referendum : s  please do n't think i 'm exagerating , again please see what happened in turkey and how referendums can be manipulated . 
  yeah i know erdogan 's recent referendum was outright rigged . 
  and in greece 's case , the result was partly ignored :\\ . 
   would you rather i say he was n't lying , but he was incompetent ? 
  that 's why i think he 's partly victim of the circumstances , due to overbearing pressure from the troika that dictate everything he does and cut them from markets whenever they try to do anything else on their own . 
   first of all , glad you know pasok . 
  would you be surprised to know to know that the core of his party is now ex-pasok people ? 
  there 's ministers who were in pasok since the 70s . 
  basically , pasok is now syriza ( painting things in broad strokes ) . 
  that 's an interesting point you make there ( no sarcasm ) . 
  thank you for pointing it out . 
   they tried to close tv stations , and open ones financed by banks organised by people openly in favour of syriza . 
  i remember that bit . 
  it was argued that there were significant money laundering/embezzlement by pasok officials there ( ie the party and officials had deals to send too much money to some tv stations which sent back some of it no problems to pasok under the table ) . 
  regarding the second bit , i know some banks offered to open new ones for free to fill in the void ( because a country without tv stations is not going to go far ) ; which they agreed because it costed nothing to the bankrupt government . 
  do n't hesitate to contradict me please  the biggest newspaper in the country was put under their direct control yeah that feels a bit like dictatorship there : /  people are dying because health is just destroyed , yep , the bit that tends to make me so angry about greece . 
  and hearing about people dying * from malnutrition * 5 years ago in the eu in reported casualties ... iiiirk . 
   they are not even fixing ambulances , and there 's no need for that because please believe me when i tell you that greece is not zimbabwe yup , which is why i was half hoping some of that surplus mentionned in the headline could be redirected toward healthcare . ? 
   i 'll just end up by saying that no oligarch lost one cent from this government . 
  ^ ( tbh , i should n't admit it but it sometimes works better when billionaires do n't necessarily know how much they lost recently and just keep on with their lives and partying and working and golfing and jetplaning around without looking to close at the number . ), 
   the biggest players in greece are shipowners good point there however , yes . 
  the shipping owners are reportedly ridiculously wealthy . 
  mind you , i heard that small rumors that they once collectively defacto owned a certain piraeus port ( that was on paper gov assets , build and maintained on gov money , but exploited for free by them ) .
