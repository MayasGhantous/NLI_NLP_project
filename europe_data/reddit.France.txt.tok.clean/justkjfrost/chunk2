  going without insurance being btw qualified suicide since only the emergency room will agree to see you in case of trouble ( then the 5 figure bill will follow you for the next years to come ) . 
   so still if i was doing what im doing now in usa , i would be alot richer than im now and even discarding those 2 sticky points and extrapolating you were right ( you arent . 
  ) ; a 1800  2300 certainly does n't qualify as `` x10 '' . 
   i run those numbers so many times so i know well , might i suggest getting into touch with your futur insurance & credit providers then ? 
  because they might have not told you the entire truth . 
  we do n't have death penalty here even and even if we were in country where there is ; it would be near impossible to prove he deserves it either way ( e.g : violent prisonner that both commited known war crimes & can not be reintegrated in society ) . 
  on the other hand he probably deserves decades in jail , yes . 
   being a co-owner of transport company in usa/canada earns your more , hence lower taxes and other shit and the rent is like 2000 % higher , so is the food ; there is no healthcare if you do n't buy an insurance that costs you a kidney with that kind of income ( expect 600 $ / mo ) ; electricity is several hundreds $ a month if you live in california or the eastern cost etc ( let alone mandatory air cooling/heater in half the state that twice or thrice it , with the crazy weather there ) . 
  so , instead of being richer , you 'd pay a lot more and just have a slight difference . 
  ( oh and seriously , never break any bone in the usa , or it means filling bankruptcy or finding tens to hundreds of thousands of $ ) . 
   if i was doing the same im doing in europe in usa i would get 10 times more money lol . 
  you remind me of those refugees that came in germany thinking they could get by with working 5h per week . 
  once you account for price differences , imho you might have a slight increase in lifestyle but that 's it . 
  well , to their credit , refugees did n't picked where they were born . 
  joigning daesh however is a 100 % willfull act and problably somwhere around `` high treason '' imho . 
   their ideas , in the tradition of aldous huxleys brilliant book `` brave new world '' . 
  annnnnd there 's our first disguised godwin point . 
   what turn of events caused people from kosovo to come to bavaria in such large numbers that they constitute 40 percent of the migrants there ? 
  that 's indeed ~ ~ curious ~ ~ important ; it 's nowhere near syria or the thirdworld , or even any warzone since decades . 
  it probably worth looking what 's causing them to flee the country . 
   illegal , we 've tried and it 's illegal under international law . 
  well , looks like we 'll have to ignore that law a bit : / libya 's half lawless either way right now . 
   we should rescue them but at the same time it encourages them to try knowing if they have a chance of being rescued . 
  take them back and destroy their boats . 
  agreed, 
   why is them winning so dangerous ? 
  well , to put it into perspective they did human hunts for fun ( as in `` the ultimate danger game '' ) . 
  lots of their members are in jail over serious violence ( assaults , beatings , blackmail , mafia practice & `` protection business '' , industrial-level theft , etc etc ) . 
  oh and they are openly actual nazis . 
  the germany-in-1940 kind . 
  they have 15 % quiet support in reality in greece . 
  it 's still quite dangerous . 
  well they had the fsb clean up the vk profile of soldiers who went in ukraine so it 's not outlandish they 'd do the same in syria . 
  i 'd be more surprized they 'd refuse to go in syria tho , there 's no risk of going against nato or bs backstab invasion war . 
   ok guys , we 've solved it !, 
  the problem is ( yet again ) greece !, 
  no , but it 'll be time to turn back volumes that make it daily back to turkey i guess : / send back anyone that does n't show syrian papers ?

  i heard 20/25 % last weeks :\\, 
  agreed ; it 'd help reduce immigration flows to more manageable levels . 
   and sputnik news . 
  that one is real propaganda . 
  do not know about deutsche well on the other hand . 
   , us , russian or assad , but somebody has to go in . 
  yeah , russian ones would do best . 
  assad is blocked away but the nusrais/fsa , and america would be the eternal invader . 
   there has to be boots on the ground obviously special forces & spotters etc , but the bulk of the army is staying home i meant . 
  if there was an us or russian division on the ground crushing them , we 'd hear about it . 
   for obvious reason i know , his life is in danger , but it means that at least for me , having no access to classified information as a civilian it 'll probably be declassified after the wars . 
  it 's less him that is in danger and more of his immediate family . 
  you know how north korean defectors avoir revealing their real names to avoid shipping their family to gulag ? 
  yeah . 
   that makes the report untrustworthy . 
  well , i know from errh second hand that the tadmur prison was just as bad for a fact , so it 's sadly all too trustworthy to me . 
   granted yugoslavia was never really totalitarian to the full i 'm sorry but tito was a puppy next to what went under saddam or staline . 
   although daily mail is n't the best source , i plead guilty haha all my sources at hand were in french and i did n't thought it would be as interesting if you could ` nt read it directly ( e.g : http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2014/12/02/alois-brunner-criminel-nazi-a-jamais-impuni_4532946_3210.html )  assad is far from perfect , your regime torturing to death tens of thousands of people generally disqualify you for that . 
  and that 's ignoring the entire civil war . 
   but he is probably the fastest way to peace if he does n't torture to death rebels after signing peace . 
  ergo , his secret prison system must be provenly dismantled ( like the cws ) . 
   because that same secret police is the best tool for keeping extremists like isis and al nusra under control . 
  about that , uh . 
  how to put it . 
  the fall of tadmur was not just a strategic failure alone ; it was also at least partly due to unchecked daesh cells everywhere in the town and an army in extremely poor shape too . 
   this is more than a civil war , this is a proxy war between russia and the us . 
  if only . 
  the main us closest thing to a proxy in the south is quiet ( the sf ) ; the kurds in the north are n't interested to really go beyond their borders ( rojava ) ; and the moderates in idlib/aleppo are overpowered by nusra . 
  then there is that division 30th disaster . 
  and despite overwhelming air superiority , the coalition is not touching assad at all . 
  so if the us wanted to use syria to annoy russia , they did it very badly . 
   nd us wants isis to take him down uh , no . 
  the mission was to take on isis actually but without boots on the ground . 
  and it failed , due to the fsa being way too weak . 
  in fact , the coalition remains in syria nearly exclusively to bomb daesh ( the second side objective was to protect rojava/krg but that bit is mostly fullfilled )  so they can come in and clean up the mess . 
  well , obviously i ca n't really talk for the us proper , but i 'd love for russia to actually come in and clean the daesh mess , but that 's just me . 
  that way the usa/coalition could keep avoiding putting troops in syria outside of rojava . 
   meaning it has to do with the civil war yes and no . 
  it 's the bit they can prove . 
  caesar ( a former employee of one of those sites ) used the civil war to defect in the ambiant chaos ( and probably because he was shocked by barrel bombings of civilian neighborhoods as collective punishment , i think ) , which is why they got pictures & inside info of this area during this time . 
   people never got jailed for jokes errrrh . 
  actually it suspiciously looked like the saddam or staline era terror from what i heard ; probably because the system was built by afez al assad ( bashar 's father ) with soviet help & by recruiting ex nazis & kgb interrogators & similar personnal after wwii ( stuff like that : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2863568/from-hitler-assad-one-world-s-wanted-nazis-secretly-employed-syria-agent-terror.html ) . 
  if saddam did it , the assad regime probably did it too ( with or without the complicity of bashar ) . 
   hopefully there will be a ceasefire . 
  agreed, 
   letting their women and children get hide and get killed while they 're fleeing for europe as i understand it , for the moment latakia & damascus proper are n't too much shelled ; so they take the risk . 
  however since the gov weaken they do n't have a lot of time . 
  and heading north towards turkey is now dangerous because they have to pass throught isis or nusra territory in a lot of case . 
   problem with fighting an irregular army is that all the enemies are technically civilians since they wear no uniforms . 
  we 're not talking about soldiers going rampant who commited war crimes here . 
  we 're talking about a dozen `` blacksites '' country wide , where suspected dissidents that made a joke about the president are disappeared by the local kgb-trained secret police , and where their family follow them frequently a few weeks laters . 
  it 's an organized system a la gulag . 
  if you ever heard about the infamous tadmur prison , you will probably understand what i 'm talking about . 
   if fsa is not al nusra or isis then the 20 year old men can fight for the fsa . 
  right now i think a cease fire between the saa & fsa & forcing the gov to close it 's secret prisons would probably be the best option to end the massacre . 
   source ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3797zy/saa_soldier_serving_3_years_past_his_mandatory/ and a few hungry soldiers near tadmur before it fell makes me suspect it 's similar in a lot of areas . 
  edit : they probably made some progress since but i suspect even western or russian food rations looks like haute cuisine next to it . 
   and what happens to their women and children in syria while they 're gone . 
  hiding , most of the time . 
   source ?
