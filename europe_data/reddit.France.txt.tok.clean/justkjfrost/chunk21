  that 's one thing that 's never going to happen . 
  making protests and strikes illegal in france is the dead surest way to have the biggest one imaginable in the middle of your strike free area . 
  more realistically there might be a need for a permanent ( rotated ofc ) police detachement in the area , that could remove anyone that does n't enter eurotunnel like a normal passenger, 
   why have n't you ? 
  probably because i was n't around at the time actually . 
   good . 
  and there 's a lot of demand for the service they provide . 
  which still does n't entitle you to protection rackets or stealing governemental money under the guise of `` corporate welfare '' or `` safety of the tunnel '' . 
  the next man that goes `` it would be a shame if the unprotected tunnel burnt because we ca n't afford to pay our henchmen '' will probably face angry riot police in full gear , to protect it . 
   you are entitled to your personal opinion . 
  it 's like gravity , i do n't think our government tax collectors asks you your opinion that much . 
  you have money = you wo n't have welfare = you will pay taxes . 
  whether you like it or not . 
  oh and if you disagree that much you can always leave the country and/or eu and experiment how that goes in countries without such things as pesky taxes , governement , or even healthcare , firemen , potable water or police . 
  like glorious freemarket somalia . 
  the french social system is built upon the principle that those who have a lot pay a bit too for those who have nothing so that everything runs smoothly . 
  and if you do n't want to participate in society and pull your weight , we do n't need more frauders like that ; so feel free to pull a depardieu and just leave . 
  i do n't think they are paying him , which allows them to distanciate themselves when inevitably they end up called out upon it . 
  but they definitely loves to give him a soapbox to rant upon , especially against ~ ~ their great satan ~ ~ the us gov and when things paint the us in a bad light . 
  then inevitably he goes ... of topic with it . 
  for example : http://www.rt.com/usa/alex-jones-breivik-masons/ then there is all the times they '' quote an expert '' which could be traced back to some of his infowar.com ( his crazy conspirationist website ) stuff . 
  ( for those who are n't aware , alex jones is ... a bit truly gone phishing mentally . ), 
  corporate welfare is a scam to enlarge the bank account of their generally already very rich shareholders/owners/executives , nothing else . 
  eurotunnel famously made a lot of people very rich already in france . 
  i do n't think they need any government assistance . 
  especially when it 's like 1/3 of their 2014 net profits :p http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2015/02/12/97002-20150212filwww00038-edf-benefice-net-2014-en-hausse.php, 
  that would explain why they have alex jones on payroll too  . , 
  because corporations loves money . 
  so if they think they can get 7 ' 000 ' 000 free euros just by yelling `` immigrants !, 
  '' , they will . 
  edit : ah downvotes . 
  eurotunnel makes a ton of money and going by the usual corporate bullshit , the loss is probably 10 % of what they announced . 
  they can definitely take it . 
  they 're not entitled to millions of additionnal free money `` just because '' while everyone else is enduring pension cuts & austerity . 
  they are aslo ~ ~ frauding every single taxes ~ ~ `` tax exempt '' so no pity there either . 
  edit : annnnnd turns out i was wrong : < they 'll start paying starting from 2015 : http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2014/03/13/20005-20140313artfig00379-eurotunnel-voit-enfin-son-avenir-en-rose.php, 
   this danger is direct result of lack of debate that and the boat issue . 
  the eu will have to stabilize libya at some point and turn back the immigrants there ... 
  i have to admit that the yearly arrival numbers does n't look very sustainable long term : /, 
  rough translation of the article because i had a bit of downtime and if only to confirm that the google translate is indeed very good . 
  note from me : it 's very obvious that the article has a pro russian bias , and can not help but quote them repeatedly . 
  i guess the writter was also pissed his favorite actor was banned in ua ; and/or tries to paint it as a horrible sign that the world is about to end there . 
  make up your own mind about it . 
  \\* shrugs \\* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- word of the day : blacklist why do we talk about it ? 
  g\u00e9rard depardieu is the new [ hated thing ? ], 
  of ukraine . 
  the french actor and recent russian citizen is treated by the ua gov as a `` threat to national security '' , and was just added to a freshly created blacklist including above 600 personalities from the entire world . 
  his name is now banned from ua medias and no movies he acted in shall be played in the country . 
  what was his fault in this ? 
  in august 2014 , at the baltic pearl cinema festival in riga , the actor said `` i love russia and ukraine , that is part of russia . '', 
  big mistake if there was one . 
  not withdstanding the multiple statements in favor of putin he re ittered following it . 
  what is this blacklist ? 
  starting july , the ua culture minister started to make a list of personalities from the entire world considered to close from the russian gov. 
  the objective was to stop hearing about them in the country , by banning their names , their movies , songs , etc. 
  yuri zubko , vice cultural minister of ukraine , explained that the list was built around people that were `` threathening national security according the nsdc '' * said the russian newspaper vesti * ( note from frost : i love how they barely mention that it was something said by russian newspapers and with the implication that it might or might not be a complete invention ) . 
  [ according to them ] the minister underlined that this list was n't discriminatory but fits in the current ua laws . 
  the entire blacklisted personality list will be made publick on the ministerial website aug 3 . 
  after that , it should keep growing . 
  depardieu , ennemy of the ua gov ? 
  g\u00e9rard depardieu is just as famous in ukraine than in russia . 
  but the fact that he took russian nationality never went well with the ua political elite . '', 
  the kremlin adopted greedy g\u00e9rard '' wrote at the time oleksandr bryhynets , an mp in the tymoshenko block . 
  another politician said `` there was a time where depardieu supported the orange revolution . 
  now he sings for dictators '' , quoted courrier international ( note : another french newspapper ) in another article from that time . 
  and the other blacklisted ? 
  others joigned the already long list along depardieu : the serbian movie maker and musician emir kusturica ( `` papa est en voyage d'affaires , arizona dream , black cat and white cat ) . 
  july 16 the artist was to participate in a kiev festival , but the sbu cancelled it at the last minute . 
  why ? 
  because the man was pro russian and talked poorely about the ua revolution ( ndf : maidan ) . 
  other actors and realisators like oliver stone ( wall street , platoon ) or even steven seagal ( piege \u00e0 grand vitesse ) are in the list too . 
  numerous russian artists and even some ukrainians against the gov can also be found in . 
  one 's ( russian media ) website can not help but underline that the ua citizens will be missing actors and key pieces like `` quand passent les cigognes '' ( 1957 ) , or the actor alexei batalov that was also added in . 
  actually means that his name ca n't be mentioned on tv and that any movie he plays in wo n't be released in ukraine ? 
  it indeed means litterally `` his name is now banned from ua medias ; and no movies where he played shall be diffused ( shown , played in a cinema ) in the country . '', 
  i can imagine . 
  air becomes slightly volatile around depardieu , what with all the drinking . 
  ( i know you are sarcasming but ... ) well depending on sources they already owed like 500 millions to 1b a couple months ago : http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/09/29/german-company-is-top-tax-evader-in-greece/ the airport is probably worth multiple billions ; so the company would essentially be forced to pay up everything or loose it all . 
  make no mistakes , a crack down on largescale abusers is absolutely needed . 
  if companies like that can walk out of paying their taxes , then nobody will . 
  for that you have to catch the owners and if they are hiding abroad behind shell societies it can be quite hard . 
  well then repossess ( nationalize ) the airport to pay for their debts ? 
  quick ukraine ; tell you what , we recover some of all those little green men of unknown origin infiltrated all around in your eastern parts and split the $ 100 millions 50/50 what do you say ? 
  ^ ( j/k --  [ ] ) ( but , if they 're serious about it , good luck , 
  so , when do we send peacekeeping there too ? 
   dude , maybe you 've missed that the american-backed regime is killing civilians http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02884/donetsk-1_2884919b.jpg `` civilians ''  leave us alone and stop shelling our homes , `` our homes '' does n't include `` invading neighbors and declaring it 's ours '' . 
  if i invaded voronezh and planted my flag there and declared the same you think the ru army would stop coming ? 
  lol . 
   i know they are nazis lol , ah yes , `` if you do n't agree with us you are litterally hitler '' . 
   the member state governments should be member state governments , not eu governments or legislators well ; to have a decent eu gov we will need to transfer some national powers to the federal gov. 
  what better manner to do that than to push some of these national powers in the eu gov ? 
  make them part of the loop . 
   however , the solution is not to remove the higher chamber entirely , it 's to separate it from the member state governments . 
  all right . 
  times where germany and the uk will agree to cede important executive power to brussels without a powerfull representative in it like their own head of state : never , ever . 
   i 'll quote an explanation i wrote a while ago , as to why a federal system should be bicameral : your point on the voting system is extremely interesting however . 
  that would definitely help solve the representation issue on the legislative side . 
   wikipedia says this regarding the us senate ( emphasis mine ) : one of the big problems with the us senate is that on paper it 's utopia but in practice it does n't exactly run that good , as shown by the insane corruption levels and one-figure approval rate since years . 
  it 's a bit like people talking about `` the true communist utopiah '' then you compare it to the ussr . 
  ( * sorry * ) ( * do n't scream that loud please * ) .
