  if you and others think this is a good idea , there has to be some representative who would agree and help you gain traction there . 
  ( i 'm not taking stance because i simply have no real idea of what would be the best way to write a `` modern constitution '' for the eu . ), 
   if we continue waiting in this kind of european limbo that is causing us this pain people will finally hate the european project so much that it 'll be finally dead . 
  i think one of the big problems of the ez is that we do n't have an officially appointed `` top dog '' in the eu . 
  for example when there is a crisis , who does a foreign leader ( let 's say obama or putin ) call in the end ? 
  they call leaders from major countries ( ie merkel , holland , cameron , ... ) . 
  i think we lack a `` strong '' position like a real eu president or prime minister or similar ; that could possibly be directly elected or elected by the parliament or something like it . 
   it 's called having an interest in the current conflict . 
  an interest in proving that ukrainians are all hitlerworshipping nazis , that walking guns and troops there is normal ; that nobody can prove it 's russians there anyway ; that it 's all separatists but not russians anyway ; that anyone in maidan is an american conspirationist ought to personally dismantle russia etc etc. 
  yeah i do n't think you missed anything from the official state line . 
  then there are the time where you post ~ ~ the pravda ~ ~ all_the_truth in one post that you even call that way : https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2pqtiu/ukraine_the_coup_russia_rebels_crimea_nazi/, 
   posting a description of a video where azov idolizes hitler is me obsessing over azov being hitler ? 
  ... . did you fail reading comprehension in school ? 
  one ? 
  looking for the word `` nazi '' gives * 119 * occurrences just on the first page of your comments alone as of the moment i typed those lines . 
  azov gets 35 . 
  ukraine 390 . 
  so either you should start looking in your obsession or either it 's your job . 
   obsession that azov is hitler eh ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  http://imgur.com/ru9rpk3 bonus : also include the usual russian state propaganda `` maidan is a cia american invasion ! '', 
  then you have stuff like that , re using the official party line word for word then being apologist for it : http://i.imgur.com/ey9ormd.png as in `` if the ua remove their insanely corrupt russian-appointed thief that stole half the ua budget it 's a cia conspiracy ; but that the russian gov sent bandits in ukraine then armed them then tried to start a civil war in the usa it 's perfectly normal '' . 
  riiiight . 
   lol what ? 
  odessa being hit by grad ? 
  uh , sorry , really tired . 
  that one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhnvsd8mgpu, 
   what loss are you talking about ? 
  if the ua army was in the same shape they were during the fall of crimea , the russian would actually be in kiev already . 
  seriously . 
   let 's take potshots at it in hopes of hitting them until they move , and if they run away , there 's always another time where they can unload on us once again you remember the outcry from civilians hit in mariupol by russian grad ; or mh17 ? 
  now imagine if an entire skycrapper collapse and it 's the ua fault . 
  and they 'd do it every week . 
  the ua would never survive the scandal ; because all it 's sponsor would run away and with it all the money and ammo and shit . 
  so they 'd rather take risks at letting the russians run away . 
   you need to try harder when apologizing for these fucked in the head war criminals . 
  well ; you 're not going to convince me very hard when starting that way ...  feb 2015 : nasty hit ; but nothing tells me it 's the ua . 
  it could as well be russians for all i know . 
   drunk ukrainian soldiers talking about shelling slavyansk that one i can confirm , but they were drunk as fuck which already show disregard of orders . 
   july 2 2014 : ukraine airstrike on residential area : answered that one past several time ; it was a totally botched mission on an town hall chockefull of russian `` advisers '' . 
  one of the officer that helped planning it in thought they could hit the building without injuring civilians , and was dead wrong :\\ \\ . 
  that 's actually the failed operation that got the ua air force nearly grounded for the time being , for what 's it worth . 
   june 12 2015 who is shelling donetsk gymnasium proof shelling donbass from peski : we both know the russian military in donetsk harassed peski hard ; because it was there that the arty & troops covering the airport where laired . 
  some fire back went astray . 
  same for all the following ones . 
  i mean , when there is russian grad firing at you from donetsk itself : http://www.planetputin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/grad-k-in-donetsk.png what do you do ? 
  1 \u00b0 ) do n't do anything , die 2 \u00b0 ) try to scratch them away . 
  ** nothing indicates however it 's grad or random or undirected . 
  **  a factory gets shelled by special armor piercing artillery . 
  ukraine is purposefully targeting important infrastructure of dnr : was n't that one used as an ammo factory or storage already ? 
   ukraine shells hit bus , nobody killed , driver injured and building hit actually that one was fired by the russians : http://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-ukrainian-military-shelled-bus-station-in-donetsk/ i 'll cut here and just that that , by skimming the rest , all your pretty link show shelling but in most of them either : 1 \u00b0 ) i can not establish link to the ua army itself ; 2 \u00b0 ) it is not indiscriminate 3 \u00b0 ) generally there was a russian position in front of it 4 \u00b0 ) nothing of it indicate the use of `` largescale '' weapons like smersh or grad . 
  furthermore , your constant copy pastah of the same few posts , same few links , posts in / r/russia ; and obsession with proving that azov are literally hitler and it 's all a cia conspiracy with biden in it ; does seems to suggest you are simply another paid russian poster . 
   that 's how it works in any army . 
  well ; maybe that 's why russia loose then , if there is the same flexibility as always ...  and the enemy packs up and moves after the first impact unless you got him straigth or you correct litterally 10sec later . 
  tell me , do you think they 'll manage to get away from a position nearly shot 10sec before then hit successfully 10 later ? 
   or the observer is found and destroyed . 
  well if those were falling from the sky in number i 'd think i 'd hear about it haha . 
  and seeing how the russians and separatists parade any ground spotter caught ...  did you make up the tactic you are talking about , or is that from an actual field manual ? 
  just echos people told me about \\* shrugs \\* i think i 'd probably be arrested / in huge trouble if i started acquiring & scanning & uploading & quoting exactly fields manual & plans they use haha . 
   why do you think that ? 
  there were huge & fast reforms just after the capture of crimea . 
  it was the biggest red alarm you can think of . 
  the ua army was litterally scrambling to reform everything nearly on the spot as fast as possible . 
  they called in advisors from various country , etc. 
   so , you believe that we are witnessing fire correction in this video , and that the real fire mission will come later ? 
  i believe one of the later isolated shots might have been it . 
  a single successfully direct hit on a russian gun is generally enough to immobilize it and/or injure or kill the crew , am i wrong ? 
  and if you miss and the successfully run away , oh well ... another time and maybe not in a town chockefull of civis . 
   we are talking about a country that used smerch on lugansk city center i 've been hearing lots of talks from the russians on that but never saw anything concrete . 
  however , if you have videos and/or adequate proofs the ua army shot it or grad i 'm always curious of course . 
  i 'm not stupid and also know there are always people doing bad shit in the back of everyone despite orders ( see also all the arrests for torture in tornado bataillon ) , people panicking or going gan ho , etc. 
   that 's a salvo from more guns , and with a greater intensity , obviously . 
  they can easly land dozens or even hundreds ( if prep & prior reinforcements ) of hits under < 20sec on a target if really needed by calling in . 
  a single hit every 10 sec barely touching the civilian buildings around ? 
  can hardly make more targetted . 
  donetsk was n't exactly glassed . 
   really ? 
  cause i see shells landing in residential areas . 
  hence my prior comment :  russian troops love to park their artillery in front of civilians building so that when there is fire back to suppress them they can complain that the ukrainians bomb poor innocent civilians . 
  \\ -  just a retaliation in the general direction of the enemy the shots would have been a lot more spread out in that case , and they would n't have waited for the smoke to move a bit & retargeted . 
  there are also freezes/cuts in the video , suggesting additionnals times gaps between shots . 
   or they are just shelling a residential area with a salvo . 
  lol . 
  this friend is a salvo ; and uhhhh let 's say ... probably an artillery detachement ... roaring a bit at the russians on open ground near the airport ( nobody lives here since months fortunately ) , with the explicit intent to make anyone fuck off away from the area : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqokextwoae&amp;t=20s i do n't think what 's going in center donetsk is anywhere near half that kind of fire . 
  they were shelled 30min this morning by russians and only opened fire back when an ua soldier finally died . 
  then the russians used grad . 
  i think at some point the ua soldiers have a right to scratch off a few russians weapons harassing them . 
  they actually went out of their way to avoid civilians and did quite a decent job imho . 
  100 % agreed . 
  that 's why i think such `` small '' movements are usefull : they generate a discussion and people can contribute positively over time & make their mind before doing anything too rash & dangerous . 
   that random shelling it 's obviously not random : they hit multiple times around the sames points in that video . 
  there 's obviously a wait time between each hits for smoke to dissipate , allowing fire correction and/or checking whether the russian target moved . 
  they were most likely targetting russian mortar or arty positions that harassed ua troops km away a bit earlier . 
  russian troops love to park their artillery in front of civilians building so that when there is fire back to suppress them they can complain that the ukrainians bomb poor innocent civilians . 
  yes and no . 
  the justice issue in ukraine is that there are mainly three ( two ) kind of people there : - people doing their job ( 10 % ? ), 
  - people vaguely trying to do their job but taking bribes and stealing money they definitely should n't . 
  - people in just to offer systematically a `` pay up or loose the trial '' and make a ton of quick money ( they should all be out ) . 
  it would be very easy to 1 \u00b0 ) offer amnesty for past dealing to anyone who give back the money and stop being corrupt ( if caught now , jail ) to clean up the second category 2 \u00b0 ) make regular sting ops to clean up the ranks very fast & systematically hand the names over for corruption inquiries but ... 
  well ; it 's 85 + % corrupt yes .
