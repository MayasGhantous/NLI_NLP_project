  i 'd simply suspect that if adequatly watched ( and offered amnesty for past dealings ; `` should the bulk of the money be recovered . 
  anyone caught stealing starting now end up in jail . '' ), 
  half of them could stop taking bribes and play somewhat by the rules ( and you still need people to fill in for judges in the mean time ) . 
  the other half has no place anywhere near any office and and are just in for the money  out . 
  we did found out the hard way recently that some people like schauble do n't want to engage in discussions . 
  they just want to be the ones giving all the orders and everyone around to fold at any costs and will try their best to humiliate you once they succeed in doing so . 
  just like ukraine should lustrate nearly half the justice apparatus ( judges , ... ) ... : /, 
   though i loathe the yet-again timidity of its proposals if you go too fast then people would start ... complaining again about the loss of sovereignty and put their own interests first ( ... like sch\u00e4uble ) above the union and it could collapse . 
   really ? 
  mexico is more dangerous than north korea ? 
  for a westerner , maybe . 
  nk organize tours , and if a westerner disappear it 's a huge diplomatic incident . 
  personally i 'm not saying it would be smart to visit that hell hole but ... and mexico has serious amounts of gang violence . 
  us/eu citizens getting kidnapped is n't exactly unheard of sadly ( that happened several times in the last few years ) . 
  ( iirc it is or was bad to the point where the us marines were forbidden/discouraged to go there in their downtime ? 
  http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/restricted-travel-mexico-marines-military-220001861.html ; and we 're not talking disarmed toddlers there ), 
  i think it 's kindah missing a `` 0b '' : /, 
  even if they did 1/1000 of our economy  2/1000 of our economy , that is 100 % growth , it 's still 100 % a hellworld that could be used as a boogey men against even somalia or zimbabwe . 
  if they started by closing all the concentration camps and worked on bringing in & distributing in more food & stop going full staline on anyone that does n't cry for the eternal president hard enough ; that would be a lot less of a hellhole . 
  i 'll make do without it most of the time , thank you very much . 
  and we also have the `` external propaganda '' they send our way throught outlets like sputnik or rt , or paid peoples online ( http://imgur.com/a/r0k8w ) . 
  but yes i 'm sure you can take my sarcasm litterally and inform us how it 's totally not like that . 
  those governments did n't took an hand as active as sch\u00e4uble to enforce constantly new conditions on greece , maybe . 
  that would explain why less people blame them . 
  how is that an humiliation ? 
  better wear it than having a bullet hole in case al shabaab or some other crazy islamist group decide to add the italian leader to their score board . 
  you know fully well it 's not syriza but germany that blocked the roof on the emergency money & the ecb that cut them too , to crash their banks . 
  it was a political decision by the troika . 
  i ca n't wait to see how the russian propaganda machine will try spinning that one home . 
  maybe something like `` georgian russophobic american nazi jewnta oppresses poor russian speaker miners from ~ ~ don \\ ^ w ~ ~ south ossetiah '' . 
   i read somewhere that we are losing 1 % of gdp every week the banks are closed . 
  ouch . 
  take it with a cargo of salt ; but apparently sch\u00e4uble wants to expulsate greece : http://www.wsj.com/articles/grexit-favored-by-many-members-of-german-government-says-schauble-1436877063 tsipras ca n't really sign that ( * yet ? * ) . 
  so germany tries to make the treaty constantly more painfull with barely disguised sanctions to force them to reject it . 
  except tsipras still ca n't . 
  ( a rationnal plan would possibly now be to prepare drachma in secret just-in-case it becomes too painfull , starting from yesterday , with all the bank notes ready for filling the atm in a few days , but that 's just me ) http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/10/germany-greek-pain-debt-relief-grexit edit : fixed links, 
  ... guys , some of you just tarnished your name by trying to kidnap a kid a few days ago . 
  how about you do n't do something even more dark just after like threathening the one covering your arse ? 
  any kind of spending `` negatively '' affects it . 
  hell coming that way they 'd argue that a tax agency means appointing people means spending means negative . 
  they wanted to force tsipras to re enforce austerity measures agreed by the past gov , and basically undo the entire syriza program they did since coming in power . 
  it 's a denial of democracy & sovereignty of the highest order & purely intended to humiliate them and show them that `` germany 's giving the orders here '' . 
  here comes the molotovs . 
  french here but feels strange to be supporting the gov side after euromaidan : / at least syriza is n't living in a golden palace stealing all the moneyz . 
  edit : alt live cam & pov here ( crappy resolution ) : http://live.reuters.com/event/greek_debt_crisis_4?utm_source=twitter edit : people seems to be calm ( ed ) now ; protestors but no rioters edit : remind me , how fast you think they could start printing drachmas secretely , leave the eurozone overnight and default on everything ? 
  just jokingly poking at the idea . 
  that agreement is murdering them and [ already boosting the golden dawn greek nazi party ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/greece/comments/3dbnye/crisis_megathread/ct49qso ) : x edit : for those that does n't understand , i really hope that germany is n't betting on the gd replacing syriza in a maidan `` just to teach them a lesson '' . 
  edit : lots of protestors ... left ? 
  it came back from a maidan size to a protest edit : i believe i should say it ; thanks to the greek population for staying so level headed despite the crazy circumstances edit : riot police reformed a line and very calmely pushed them out . 
  ( absolutely zero violence visible , slow walk and gestures to move out ) edit : making place for an ambulance & med crew , that explains it edit : most remaining people seems to have left , looks like it 's over for tonight, 
  * probably the wall itself if you look at the basis of the issue !, 
  yeah , but i mean before . 
  hum . 
  the agreement or printing drachma or another solution ; once the atm was empty it was empty . 
  if all the atm runs out ( and that 's still a serious risk . ), 
  and they ca n't even get 50 $ anywhere , shit would totally hit the fan like no tomorrow . 
  the closest situation i know anything about is ukraine , and they have a war going on , and the banks are n't closed and there is uh parrallele economic circuits/distribution going on ( humanitarian , volunteers , lots and lots of blackmarket etc ) and the situation is still quite dire in some places . 
  greece has currently none of that going on . 
  for a greek , if the fridge is empty & you ca n't withdraw & you do n't have spare cash and the store do n't make you credit ; that 's pretty much it . 
   riot, 
  ... we 're already at that point . 
  it 's all hanging on an illusion and on the banks opening and delivering cash they do n't have at the atm . 
  https://twitter.com/jeromeroos/status/621306790622404609 well ; shit  jerome roos @jeromeroos  i 'm hearing that the cops are expecting major riots in athens tonight . 
  to add to the gloomy sense that #greece is about to go down in flames, 
  well of course it was used by the `` no '' side too , to say they wanted to fire all french workers to replace them with cheaper immigrants paid with peanuts . 
   i really dont recall this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_plumber ( long story short the guy was in fact quietly joking about hiring polish plumbers being cheaper than legal minimal wage frenchs )  on the other hand , the left `` no '' side made a campaign of lies , pretending that if we rejected it , we would have a better text with a lot of social advantages and free ice cream . 
  you are speaking truth there : both sides were definitely a bit retarded, 
   after the french to our discharge , the french of that era gov tried to pass in sneaky work-related clauses ( on the minimal wage for inter-country work in shengen , on the number of hours , regulations , etc allowing them to basically use hungarian work legislation instead of the french one with some loopholes ? 
  i 'll also spare you all the [ polish plumber jokes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_plumber ) it created ) in the implementation here , if i remember correctly . 
  then they went full pravda on the topic on tv , basically `` vote yes or we kick that puppy on live tv '' and french people being all contrarian became a bit pissed and massively voted ~ ~ oxi ~ ~ no as a consequence . 
   watch this shit get fixed in two days . 
  we can only hope , 
  that part is scandalous and definitely something greece should prepare plans for ; along with the tax fraud & evasion & corruption, 
   nope . 
  just fed up with general stupidity , bias and ignorance of people that are willingly vocalising it as facts . 
  then maybe argumenting instead of repeating `` idiot !, 
  idiot !, 
  idiot ! '', 
  would help your cause . 
  do you get a high on insulting people or something ? 
  genuinely curious  _ , 
  how about you go back defending the invasion of georgia & theft of a pipeline & yell whattaboutamerica for your boss ; and let the others do their job ? 
   the problem is that the greek gdp was ballooned by sovereign debt bubble . 
  economics are funny , everytime the economy crash for whatever reason people yell `` it was a bubble ! '' . 
  even if it was because we fired all the workers and pensionners to give their wage back to germany instead . 
   in 2009 it was 9.8 % and in 2010 it was 15.7 % of gdp . 
  in 2010 the primary deficit , that is deficit before interest payments 9.6 % . 
  and how much in raw numbers ? 
  because if the spending only followed inflation but the gdp crash ...  what happened that greek governments loaned more and more money to fuel the economy of course , since the eu only wanted to give them loans and `` federal cash transferts to greece like to the eastern landers in germany '' are an insult . 
  say , you have no income and the bill fall . 
  then suddenly you borrow to your family to pay it . 
  and the next . 
  and after 3 months , they tell you `` no you spent it all like a drunk sailor ! '' . 
  is the problem that you did spend it all on booze & drugs ? 
  no ( you paid bills only with it ) . 
  it 's because you have no income ( gdp crash ) . 
   and estonia , lithuania , latvia , slovakia , slovenia , etc. . . all have smaller gdp per capita than greece and they are not complaining because their gdp is rising . 
  oh and btw estonia is basically the local luxembourg-like capital of tax fraud & evasion . 
  i sure do n't hear luxembourg complain when they make a million because they helped a company fraud a billion of taxes .
