  okay  that 's something, 
  let 's see what it says . 
   in order to form the basis for successful conclusion of the mou , the greek offer of reform measure needs to be seriously strenghtened to take into account ...  the greek government needs to formally commit to strengthening their proposal in a number of areas identified by institutions , with satisfactory clear timetable ... \\  is it me or it means `` greece will have to sign whatever additionnal demands is required of them , without even knowning yet what it is going to be '' ? 
  that 's the reforms greece must pass to even have a right to negociate staying in the eurozone ? 
  a surrender without knowing the terms ? 
  : / so , okay let 's stay calm for a minute and not panick , i guess they want greece to enforce part of the last austerity proposals as good will before having a right to negociate the rest or any garantees that the troika will actually loan them 85b . 
  seems reasonable enough . 
   finally , to amend or compensate for roll-back legislation adopted during 2015 , which have not been agreed with the institutions and run counter to the commitements agreed in the framework of hte 20 february 2015 eurogroup statement . 
  yeah basically they want syriza to surrender their sovereignty and power to pass any laws and suspend any and all internal spendings that have n't been validated or opposed by the troika . 
  and revocate the entire political program that got them elected in the first place , and therefore ignore entirely openly the full democratic will of the greek citizens . 
  sorry but i have a feeling that 's going to cause `` a bit '' of unrest if that happen . 
   the eurogroup takes note of the possible programme financing needs of between eur 82 and 86bn , as assessed by the institutions . 
  the eurogroup invites the institution to explore possibilities to reduce the financing envelope . 
  are they really living the same situation ? 
  it 's not 80 bn that greece need , it 's a lot more . 
  let alone the 300bn debt too , before the hair cut . 
  granted there 's to be an investment program simultaneously , but if you tell the greeks they wo n't even get the whole bailout money and will have to cut on it too , what 's even the point of the concessions or announce those numbers for the bailout ?!?? 
   the greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely sooo neither the whole bailout , nor an haircut nor any moratorium on the debts ? 
  again , what 's the point of the negociations in that case ? 
  what do they even get ? 
  it ca n't possibly be serious , they just want to kick greece out and make more and more impossible demands disguised as negociations to force it down . 
   in case no agreement could be reached , greece should be offered swift negociations on a time-out from the euro area , with possible debt restructuring . 
  there , this passage is basically an admission to it . 
  they do n't expect greece to do such impossible commitement ; nor even wants it . 
  they openly want to push the country out of the euro at least temporarily . 
  ~ ~ time for the technocrates that assist greece to dust a variant of that plan i guess : x drachma & giant fraud crackdown & capital controls & debt printout here we go : / ~ ~ edit : apparently they agreed for debt restructuring and delays https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d3mhb/agreement_reached_reports_belgian_pm_euro_council/, 
  and what would they do with it ? 
   why should they get abu bakr al baghdadi alive ? 
  no one needs or wants him . 
  well i 'm afraid it 's already a bit late for that point either way , as far as i can tell : \u00b0, 
  those guys are more like a real world version of kids playing [ 4 lions ( the movie ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_lions ) but without suicide bombs, 
  what ? 
  you think they ca n't find a few millions to pay lawyers to get back billions from the crooks ? 
  or even ask the usa/uk ( / france ? ), 
  to lend them some legal advisers to help the lawyers already on greek gov payroll ? 
   there is no such thing as a temporary grexit well , if schauble , the german finance minister and right hand of angela merkel in those negociations says otherwise , i 'll believe him . 
  ( and greece will probably try to get that one down in writing . ), 
   and greece will not want to revert to a currency union there are very important political reasons why they would , actually . 
  the same one that got them in in the first time and pushed them to go as far as cook their book that badly . 
   and the other states would probably not want them back anyway well in case of economic success without cooking , why not ? 
   thinking of the way finland , the netherlands and germany see the syriza government and greece right now . 
  well , for all the `` the soviet are coming ! '', 
  talks about syriza , they ai n't the ones that routinely killed people for fun , unlike the golden dawn that nobody complains about because-hey-at-least-the-nazi-paid-their-debts ( yeah i heard that one . ) . 
   if it does n't work out and the economy takes a nose dive for decades to come ( more likely ) they will not be allowed back in the club . 
  spoiler : it is already taking a dive either way and they would have been kicked out regardless either way . 
  massive additionnal austerity ( times worse than the current propositions ) to stay in would murder it too . 
   by the way , what would happen to greece 's debts , is a temporary grexit a default ? 
  i 'd suspect that 's more or less what the germans are betting on , but with an extra side of `` not an eu responsability anymore '' ( fair enough ) . 
   regular civillians shouldnt be armed with automatic weapons and walking around in army uniforms . 
  i believe that 's why they got arrested . 
   1 - switching between two currencies back and forth sounds as if it implies all kinds serious problems from an economics and a political standpoint . 
  worse than an outright defaut and the immediate situation ? 
  another group of islamists claiming `` it was all a joke '' yay . 
  while the guys definitely has a sense of humor ; [ let 's see what they did before the trial ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cxpmz/leader_of_french_group_founded_to_counter/cszwwr5 ) :  comme celle-ci , projet\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience , o\u00f9 une horde de cavaliers en image de synth\u00e8se galope dans la poussi\u00e8re sur fond de grognement de b\u00eates sauvages et de bruits d\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9es . 
  says it all really . 
  rough translation : `` on another [ video ] showed to the [ trial 's ] audience , a horde of horsemen in cgi ride in a cloud of dust with a background of savage beast noises and swords noise . 
  a warrior message and another sequence later , some forsane alizza try themselves in close combat ; on the green grass near lyon [ ndf : \\* cringes at the idea \\* ] and [ impliedly pathetically ] gestures while in black attire around a punching ball while yelling `` allahu ackbar ! '' . '', 
  ( sic ) `` or another posted december 20 , 2011 , where are mixed a message of [ ossama ] bin laden , a tribute to azzam - al qaeda co founder - , some bombing apologism , and the rage of a palestinian kid yelling she will end [ hard to translate but `` murder the idea of '' ] zionism ( sic ) , the whole thing marred of complains about charlie hebdo 's caricatures . 
  a perfect sample of forsane alizza 's broad hitting propaganda . '', 
  they also talk how the group regularly called to `` do jihad on the infidels '' . 
  if the allegations there are true , they 're pretty much jihadis wannabees . 
  quite hard to deny it . 
  there has to be an eu country that could lend them decent legal advisers that could guide them there . 
  \\* look closely at the uk and usa \\* reducing fraud is always in the interest of every big countries with such amounts invested everywhere . 
   without getting sued back for even more . 
  on what basis ? 
  gs organized that fraud . 
  anything they 'd drop on greece would only reveal them as more and more guilty of more and more fraud and would be the perfect argument to freeze & cease more and more of their money . 
  kiev 's police have been entirely replaced due to that , and in some other places too . 
  plus the sbu is n't taking bribes anymore ( well at least as far as i can see ? ), 
  and rs have ways to phone in the administration should they have intel on such a high level criminal . 
  and i believe there 's some middle ground between letting corruption goes away and starting to shoot rpg and other heavy weapons in the streets in peacefull areas and accidentally injuring a number of civis : x, 
  thinking over it , sch\u00e4uble is not entirely wrong : that second `` backup '' plan has some potential : - they leave * temporarily * ( * with a written specific agreement on that point * , that should they manage to get the country back in proper economic order they will be accepted back ) the currency area . 
  altho they stay in the eu proper . 
  - recovering control of their currency allows them to print out a degree of deficit to have a few more years to get it under control . 
  - as for the debts , f. . . it they print it all out in drachma and the creditors can take it or leave it . 
  that will make some scream , but wiping their entire debts and while still giving a few scraps ( backed on their own remaining industry & economy ) is better than an outright defaut . 
  wait a bit for the value to stabilize * then * convert accounts of citizens in drachma , to limit the print-out linked inflation for the general population . 
  and/or partly pre account for heavy inflation , under the 10k $ insurance bar . 
  - that gives time to fix the country , implement the important bits of the agreement ( largescale crackdown on fraud , reform of the tax system , reforms of the public sector , slight reductions in pension to manageable levels and huge reductions on other points to make the numbers viable ) . 
  - that gives syriza some time to prove their alternative strategy is at least somewhat viable too ( 5y ) and the economy to breath without just sending all the cash away out of the country - then once the slate is clean , they can come back without crippling debts and an out of control deficit . 
  should the greeks be pushed out of the country sunday , this could be a decent backup plan . 
  that can also being spinned to the population at `` see , they asked worse austerity than what was sane and reasonable and we refused , as demanded by the oxi vote . '', 
  now , they have to work on implementing drachmas ready * as fast as humanly possible * should the plan a ( proposed reforms , honestly the best possible enforcable austerity given the current circumstances ) fail sunday . 
  hell yes . 
  about time !, 
  do it !, 
  do it !, 
  do it !, 
  hypothetically if greece where to sue them and win i hope they 'll recover billions from them . 
   i do n't know if the shooting already stopped yes , afaik  but units of the national guard are being sent to mukachevo . 
  probably needed before some gang decide to pick up lan 's slack in his absence or something like it goes off hand ( revenge , etc ) . 
  they 'll prolly move away a bit later when things get calm back again . 
  the way i see it they wanted to fall on lanho because he was a corrupt mafia bastard . 
  problem is he was armed too and had his gang that quickly opened fire on rs , that defended themselves . 
  it devolved in shooting ( i mean really a rpg guys ? ), 
  till the sbu & police learnt of it , went in , picked the half deads on the ground and detained everyone till they figure exactly who did what . 
  attacking a mafia boss frontally takes guts , gon na give you that , but really they could have called in the kiev police as backup/to assist and do their job officially before it went all shooty : x, 
   what do you mean with `` full russian '' - part ? 
  the corrupt police is a russian specialty .
