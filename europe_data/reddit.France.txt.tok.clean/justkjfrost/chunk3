  if you have a strong stomach , look for the so called `` caesar report '' itself and the associated photos , but some non-gore context might help : http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28554845 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_syrian_detainee_report http://www.wsj.com/articles/10-000-bodies-inside-syrian-president-bashar-al-assads-crackdown-1406315472 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/evidence-industrial-scale-killing-syria-war-crimes the facts in it are generally admitted even by the pro gov syrians as far as i know , their argument being `` he 's a lesser evil '' . 
   the fsa is al nusra and isis i 'm sorry but that statement is one of the most idiotic i heard . 
  the fsa is not al nusra . 
  however , they were definitely hijacked and pushed aside and are in a very weak position . 
  they do n't control much nowadays in the north ( half the political power in idlib , bits held near the coast , bits in aleppo ; and a lot more in the south with the southern front but it 's on the other end of the country . ), 
   of syria will take any men capable of going to war and provide them with necessary equipment they ca n't even provide them with regular food ... 
   80 % of immigrants are men around 20 years of age a lot of men are doing the risky travel to get their family to go behind them by plane . 
  it 's a calculated risk both ways . 
   those people are capable of fighting and should fight . 
  oh yeah , for who ? 
  bashar al assad ( aka the official gov ) who runs concentration camps ? 
  daesh ( you might have heard of them as `` isis '' , or `` the ones who behead & burns people alive '' ) ? 
  the fsa that got it 's arse handed everywhere that is n't idlib ( and even then ) or the southern front ? 
   but i am not polish and have no relation to poland , i give nothing to poland and in return i get nothing from poland . 
  no , but we were talking about poland so i was talking about it . 
  i could do the same by replacing all reference of poland with ones to croatia . 
   and more money would be better . 
  well then , how about you pay more taxes to your gov so they rebuild croatia a bit better , if you have so much money lying around ? 
   what basic food , they have food in their own countries for the economic immigrants , yes , we should turn them around . 
  for syria proper , uh . 
  uhhhh . 
  not always : http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2012/10/mideast-syria_horo-61.jpg it 's one of the hardest warzones on earth right now . 
  even the ngo do avoid it now . 
   and it would be better for poles if the money was spent on polish people and their needs , not the immigrants . 
  it 's like saying `` and it would be better in poland if i emptied / u/wolf3521 \\ 's bank account and used it to fund the building of roads '' . 
  yeah it sounds ridiculous . 
  they just get enough to eat , not much more . 
  money is also already spent on all the rest in poland , in the dozens of billions a year ( edit : i 'm talking about eu funds alone , ie a net benefit to poland ) . 
  so how about we do n't remove the basic food out of the mouth of thousands of people just because `` it would be better for the few people that live in such and such street if it means the alsphate relayered 1 month earlier '' ? 
   if you want to help them you take them . 
  true , we definitely could step up to lessen the flow on other countries ( pressure should also dry up a lot after starting to ask for papers or proof that refugees do come from syria or similar . 
  it 'd remove all those not coming from warzones , ie 3/4 of the flow ) . 
   your argument how it 's good for the polish economy is bullshit , it would be better spent on poland without the immigrants . 
  you remind me of the oligarchs that refuse to pay back taxes to society after pocketing countless billions , `` because it 's theft/muh money/i would spend it better than the state on myself '' . 
  wake up . 
  a few millions or dozen millions of good will is pennies on a state budget . 
  the issue is less economic and more social ( integration of so many people at once is difficult ) . 
  one does not preclude the other . 
  there is n't a single budget post in the polish budget , and i doubt a few millions aside will represent more than a rounding error . 
  well , if things are worrying they can always reinforce the police apparatus . 
  nobody 's paid to break or destroy anything . 
  so your point is ? 
   house and my car right , you also forgot the part where they came in to evict you while singing `` glory to staline and the ussr ! '' . 
  there 's always a good excuse when people do n't want to do something, 
  not necessarily . 
  it comes from the government , but not always tax money alone . 
  it could be printed money , it could be eu funds , it could be money recovered from corruption , re allocation , etc etc, 
  http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=poland http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=germany errrh poland looks like significantly cheaper . 
  like half the german prices once you account for conversion . 
  cares to elaborates on what makes you think so ? 
  thing is this is what people would need money to spend upon first regardless , and it goes back straight into the polish economy ; so it 's a win/win . 
  per day ? 
  yeah , maybe . 
  if you have skills and speak the language, 
  employer , or employee, 
  does n't mean we should n't give them a hand , even if it goes on only for some more time . 
  btw , if you want an immediate reason why , refugees staying in turkey is that much less coming in here anyway . 
   here is the case of migrants in sweden refusing to leave the bus in protest : i do admit that one rose quite a few eyebrows . 
  i mean , protesting life quality in * sweden * . 
   no one wants i guess autorities have to toe a line between what people wants , what 's the `` moral high horse '' and what 's actually realistic, 
  without going to that extreme , some tents and a few more mattresses could probably help . 
   if a quick , coordinated , transparent process had been in place , as well as widely available information about the process advertised to refugees . 
  well i guess that 's what they are trying to implement right now . 
  well around here they frequently have trailers and move around country wide . 
  we do try to sedentarize them with incentives tho to lessen problems . 
  well ; gypsies move frequently . 
  how do you say it ? 
   there is no fund to take money from to pay welfare yes there is , but the eu is dragging their feet . 
  that 's a different subject right now because they 're still figuring out what to do , where and how . 
  and it looks like just dictating conditions like that has been tried would just cause a political meltdown . 
  let 's not go there just right now . 
   but there 's no money to be had and all that 's only if you 're a citizen . 
  refugees that get permit will stay , which means they 'll have to work , which means they 'll create a lot of values and tax money . 
  please do n't loose sight that in reality people that work brings in value * multiple time * their wage ( most of it is intercepted before the worker ever see it ) . 
  additionnal workers is a net economical gain . 
  it 's why there are so many turks in germany . 
  it fills up german industrialists bank accounts like no tomorrow . 
  when you remove the insane fraud levels and stop the so called `` tax evasion '' fraud ( basically tax exemptions for the ones with the money , corporations ) and do actually make them pay taxes on the additionnal profits , there is a lot of margin for funding welfare and the system . 
   but most are being reconstructed and they are surprisingly really homely and comfortable on the inside . 
  at least in most cases . 
  so does proper shelters . 
  i mean properly built camps do n't look * that * bad : http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/09/turkish-refugee-camps-for-syrians-set-high-standard/ and those are well within our means , along using unoccupied empty housing ( like empty social-built flats etc ) . 
   see for yourself - 30 eur is not enough . 
  now you are dishonest because you link poland , but refugee welfare in poland would be much higher :  on approval of claim : monthly allowance up to 1,260 zlotys ( 300 euros ) , rising to 1,335 ( 317.35 euros ) from october , for one year to cover accommodation , food , clothes , polish lessons . 
  free health insurance and legal and psychological support . 
  ( source : http://www.euronews.com/2015/09/16/which-european-countries-offer-the-most-social-benefits-to-migrants/ ) 30 $ would be what you get in the balkans like croatia . 
  plus , again , they do n't have to buy food . 
   food in refugee camps is assumingly no better than food in prisons or schools is , doubly so when you 're cooking in provisional arrangements . 
  look , yeah , i know it 's not very tasty , but i swear it is not a ~ ~ russian ~ ~ eu conspiracy for once . 
   when they go to sweden it 's not just random wandering but purposeful emigration . 
  i 'm pretty sure we can accept refugees with the following `` but '' : - blatantly refuse/ban/crack down upon welfare shopping as long as there is sufficient accommodation ( boarding with utilities , food ) - refuse economic migrant for the moment ( if you come from pakistan , we send you back there and will see later when there is n't a massive immigration wave ) that are n't actual refugees fleeing a mena war zone . 
  apparently it means we could reduce back volumes by 60-80 % doing so , and could easily apply it immediately . 
   you do n't `` get '' welfare in eastern europe . 
  to receive aid , you have to have worked at least for x months in the past x years to qualify , even then the amount is a measly 250 - 450 eur ( depending on your salary ) for a maximum amount of 6 months . 
  refugees are currently a special case tho since they are banned from working in most countries , at least for some time while the host country figure out their legal situation , whatever they were running from etc. 
  edit : tho allowing them to have some job in areas that are n't hit too hard by unemployement could always help saving on welfare too . 
  and create value (  generates tax money ) . 
   the only thing they will get is army grade food ~ ~ well i do still have a box of cookie & some cheese to hide the taste if you want . ~ ~ let 's not exagerate . 
  yes food distribution is not panacea but i doubt they would artificially ensure they only get the worst food possible . 
   barely sufficient housing in hastily constructed container houses or old and unused refugee shelters you mean like the commieblocks where most of the population lives either way ?
