  i 'd say rehab the first times but yeah possibly jail sentances in case of sale recidive of hard drugs . 
  from what i was told ; the usable planes are mainly in gen. hiftar 's hands . 
  and he 's mostly aligned with tobruk ( he control what remains of their military ) . 
  i 'm sure the libyan dawn in tripoli has physically a lot of plane but i 'm not sure they 'd even know how to fuel half of them . 
   the higher solidarity supplement will hurt those in work , who must pay the higher rate that remains reasonable tho due to :  however , `` to protect the disposable income of low - and middle-income households '' there will be a reduced rate of 13 % on energy , basic foods , catering and hotels if accepted this look like a very decent compromise . 
  u/nlakes ( commenter below ) is right tho :  important to talk about things like cutting red-tape , streamlining public services ( like registering a business , undertaking compliance , paying taxes ) and increasing transparency/accountability to encourage investment and enterprise in greece ? 
  there 's work to be done there too ( and fighting rampant tax evasion ), 
  nice job !, 
  so , i think now it 's proven that corruption fighting can bring in back * serious * money . 
  greece got some work cut out for them there . 
   ca n't say , but most of weed here is local , grown in greenhouses . 
  well then i guess it 's de facto legalized , because here a greenhouse full of cannabis would probably get you arrested very fast and potentially get you in jail for a long time . 
   it would rather make the gov to be a cartel . 
  european cops do n't gun down people in the streets or their home because they owe money to the local barron . 
  drugs cartel however regularly [ cause huge gang shooting problems in marseilles ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/marseille-shootings-drugs-gangs-fire-5134566 ) ( southern france ) . 
  edit : to be clear it 's `` under control '' now but if we could cut the gangs cashflow on top of that it would be good  in my opinion the problem is that when gov will replace the `` mafia '' in its job , the prices will grow far higher becouse of taxes and i 'm quite sure they 'll establish concession for the ones that can corrupt them . 
  then people will smuggle it like cigarets , but it 'll remove the very high value and therefore blood in the streets it can cause . 
  drug addicts should be sent to rehab ( detox ) ; not prison . 
  so i agree there . 
  also legalizing canabis and treating it like alcohol would have the major effect of undercutting the drug cartels . 
  well ; unless the gov decide one day to directly hand more cash to the poorest of the population ( serious welfare & workfare , home bill help , pensions , ... ) ; it 's not going to grow . 
  your employer wo n't pay you 2k if he can get away with paying 300 $ a greek by telling him there 's 10 people waiting to get his place if he disagree , what with the 50 % unemployment . 
  how about libya do n't suicide it 's remaining airforce and instead use it against the islamists ? 
   how much more layers of democracy do we need ... well the `` problem '' is that nobody wants to remove the democratically elected country leaders ' and government 's personnal sayso in the eu governance ( and tbh i you wo n't catch me advocating for removing them out of the loop either . 
  i might or might not have interests in keeping the french gov in the question , obviously ) . 
  so : * the eu parliement is elected directly ( untouchable ) * the eu country leaders & their gov will keep a say in the gov ( untouchable , still democratic by being elected at home by the population ; basically the eu council in it 's current form : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council#members ) * potentially the eu could have a president elected by direct vote ( potentially untouchable once installed ) . 
  that 'll be at least 3 layers . 
   i 'd say we need at least one directly elected high official . 
  but there i agree . 
  we could start by electing with direct vote whoever will replace juncker or tusk once his mandate expire . 
  yeah but those heads of state got elected by their own respective population . 
  so that 's still democracy in my books ? 
  that 's actually a bit of a scary mentality ; that could lead to an even bigger major war . 
  once you cross a certain treshold , unless you screw up badly , you never really have to work anymore to get more material things \\* shrugs \\*, 
   why would i need several cars for myself ? 
  you want one or 3 cars you can use . 
  he had a car collection as a symbol of his statut and because money was meaningless to him since he could use gov budgets to get anything he wanted . 
  so he collected cars like some collect steam video games or pokemon trading cards . 
  i hate it , but that part is probably true . 
  unless the gov can fix it 's general budget to subsidise it perpetually , they 'll have to cut a bit somewhere in the pension system . 
  the greek gov could maybe start with the biggest pension payements first and protect anything below 600 $ monthly ( or the 50 % lowest ; basically anything below poverty line ) from cuts . 
  yes that part is probably worthless . 
  well considering yanukovich had ~ ~ 50 ~ ~ 70 cars ( http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/heres-former-ukrainian-presidents-car-collection ) , it 's not outside of the realm of possibilities that a few bribed officials had multiple cars . 
  sorry , you are true there . 
  he has been a vocal critic pastly . 
  simply speaking his `` photoshop ! '', 
  reaction was just so blatanly stereotypical that i could not not point it out . 
   yeah but the picture you linked is photoshopped . 
  ... come on . 
  you did n't just said that . 
  edit : just to be clear : http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/headline/public/2014/11/20/2014-11-19t170815z1254696294gm1eabk02s702rtrmadp3ukraine-crisis.jpg?itok=k1ygbpqc http://img0.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/c/11/116/247/116247132_na_kiev.jpg ( edited out ) edit : http://www.khmertimeskh.com/files/news/4366/1410396231.jpg http://www.planetputin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/russiantanks1.jpg and of course : http://jto.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/f-ukrnato-a-20140904-200x200.jpg, 
   i do understand ukrainians who write whatever they wish on the shells they use to kill people . 
  because the russians to who those shell are flying are n't coming in to kill them etc ? 
   in what they are participating in lol ; looks like to me they perfectly understand why they are for : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y_5ahpmshw  because they are feed some ideological bullshit they have no chance to judge soundly . 
  probably but if you invade other country and try to murder them , do n't go crying when they shoot back . 
  especially when it 's counter battery fire ; which means you are still shelling back just after signing `` peace '' . 
  you know the one they tryied to impose on ukraine just before razing & invading debaltseve too a couple hours later . 
   what i do not understand is people who support it , i believe you fully understand it but are just another hypocritic apologist that play the victim and complain because your russian friends get shot at for `` merely '' invading in europe . 
  because somehow that would be totally different than the russian tanks coming in by the dozen with `` hello from russia '' and `` to kiev '' or other mentions painted on the hull ?

  \\* pokes his own french country & the gov \\* hey . 
  i 'm sure we could help carrying our own weigh there . 
  talking about the saudi , i really do n't know how i feel about this ( probably worried about more destabilization ; especially after watching syria crash & burn & still being a burning warzone ) but apparently wikileaks got & released quite the dirt on them : https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3afd3i/wikileaks_says_its_leaking_over_500000_saudi/ guess somebody else decided to confront them regardless . 
   we are going to have flights now . 
  after years of every airline ignoring the airport we are going to pay ryanair for flying there as i said before . 
  if the new regional government does n't stop it somehow . 
  we have another and better placed airport close anyway . 
  i start to understand why you feel they should destroy some of those scam airports . 
  lots of wasted money indeed . 
  glad the guy got caught . 
  interesting find . 
  i suppose the gov should crack down on those too in that case , true , you 're right . 
   so far it 's not managed to attract a single scheduled flight , but mr. fabra has always defended his airport , which he manages though his public company aerocas . 
  not * a single * flight ? 
  yeah that 's definitely a scam . 
   if he 's found guilty , he could be sentenced to up to 13 years behind bars -- eight for financial fraud , four for bribery and one for influence peddling . 
  with some luck they 'll probably nail him down at some point . 
  like after his political patrons most likely covering his ass get housted next elections ? 
  to be honest , while it might be bad return on the money , i 'm less worried about that ( dozens or hundreds of millions of euro ) than the missing ( stolen ) hundreds of millions embezzled from state coffers or the missing ( dozens of ? ), 
  billions of * yearly * tax evasion/fraud . 
  stuff like that : 300m : http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/27/uk-spain-corruption-arrests-idukkbn0ig1f020141027 450m : http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4375093.ece lots-of-euros ( many billions ) : http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/sep/27/tax-evasion-how-much-does-it-cost-a-country you could open all those airports at once and still have a huge margin with just all that money . 
  would n't that costs more money than let them as in ? 
  money that they ca n't really spend on such depense . 
  he 's not * entirely * wrong tho . 
  the saudi ( and others but i 'm sure you can figure out who ) have been known to fund salafism in europe by funding the local moderate muslim movements in exchange for them being more fundamentalist . 
  the gov could probably act upon that . 
  actually that 's something i agree . 
  people guilty of violence with an identified origin should be deported asap . 
  no reason to tolerate any of that shit , even before opening refugee centers in libya or some island . 
   the greeks never wanted to go bankrupt . 
  nor go in debts . 
  sometime the `` choices '' are all shit and mostly out of your hands . 
  plus watch how the words `` defaut '' drive half the markets berserk . 
   they were offered a bail out that implied a 50 % hair cut on the creditors - that 's somer serious help , do n't you think ? 
  definitely , but apparently it was n't enough and the books were cooked to hide even more debts . 
  : /  if they go bankrupt they will have to leave the ez , there will simply be no money to pay wages , creditors , you name it . 
  unless all printed in drachma and backed by goods imported by the government . 
   hy should any entity keep giving loans to a country that does n't pay back ? 
  so , what do you suggest , bankruptcy ? 
  stopping to pay pensions and wages and healthcare ?
