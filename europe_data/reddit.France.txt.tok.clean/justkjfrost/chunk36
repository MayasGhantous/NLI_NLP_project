  watch the population try to fend on 500  200 $ / mo in a couple years of more austerity ? 
   also , what is wrong with german economic advisers ? 
  especially after the greeks cooked their books to get in the ez in the first place . 
  i got to admit that bit is definitely true , tho . 
   whatever 300eur gets you is irrelevant - well , for the average greek , it 's not irrelevant , it 's life or death . 
  and that 's what 's going to dictate their actions and whether they 're going or not to accept it longer or an even further decrease of minimal wage . 
   the purchasing power is still higher in athens . 
  well according to that link by less than 10 % . 
  if you add more austerity , it 'll mean the lifestyle in the greek capital will officially be below bulgaria and joigning romania ( except that instead of rising like in romania it 's now freefalling ) . 
   that 's kinda how it works when you take a loan , you know ? 
  you get money , but then you need to give it back . 
  you know it 's like if we forced every people indebted and filling for bankruptcy to take a 10 % loan instead of said bankruptcy and when they inevitably fail paying the additionnal 10 % on top of everything else we seized everything they and their family had then we harassed them constantly for more with death threats . 
  well that 's kindah what we did with greece . 
   forced ? 
  how ? 
  `` take the loans or get evicted from the eurozone . 
  take the german economic advisers or we will give you an even worse rate '' . 
  and similar pressures . 
   nobody is starving ... * yet * . 
  but things are bad . 
  i mean do you really think a country with de facto 50 % unemployment and talking about ending the pensions for entire chuncks of the population and cutting healthcare is healthy ? 
   there are n't more greeks starving than romanians or bulgarians . 
  food and life probably costs 300 % more in athens than romania or bulgaria edit : http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=romania&amp;country2=greece&amp;city1=bucharest&amp;city2=athens 300 $ in romania is probably livable . 
  in athens , that 's either family/friends to host you or homelessness . 
   but greece is poor too . 
  no it 's not . 
  simply speaking , half the cash in the country is getting out straight to creditor 's pockets . 
   why is this so hard to accept when it 's obvious greece is bankrupt without loans ? 
  because we forced part of those loans and interests on them and played and lost . 
  we have a part of responsability in it too ; and seizing all the furniture and house and making them homeless and half starving certainly wo n't help them recover and settle those later . 
  ( plus , gaz money incoming a few years down the line ), 
  good news , 
  ( well them fn did [ randomly burned cars and blamed immigrants for it recently ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/france-fn-militants-burned-cars-fuel-insecurity-political-gain-1505631 ) , to `` underline the insecurity '' , so you would n't be entirely wrong haha ), 
  my point is the romanians do n't have to `` suck it up '' `` just so can greece can be lazy and all '' . 
  it 's simply not true . 
  both are in bad places , but because romania is poor and need time to get to eu levels , is not an excuse to somalia-ise greece . 
  well the article i linked said those have been waved away ? 
   since coming to power three years later , the ponta government has reversed previous wage cuts . 
  sorry , replied to the wrong comment . 
  i wanted to reply to that one : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3aegqm/french_police_releases_video_showing_violent/csbv1j7  our new citizens showing their worth . 
  if this is the future of europe , we can all rest assured .

  easy to say because you never hear about the millions that work in factories or else for shit without complaining . 
  it 's always the loud & drunk that attract attention . 
  but if they were white skinned nationalists people would just say that they are `` mentally ill '' . 
  y' know kindah like with the shooting incidents , but without the guns . 
  ( btw i do n't blame the cops , they acted properly as far as i know ; did n't heard of a shooting incident like you 'd hear in the us . 
  and here 's another argument in favor of body cam to help the cops defend themselves , 
   why romanians just have to shut up and suck it ? 
  how is that fair ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  they do n't . 
  livestyle in romania is rising very fast . 
  but they are going from so bad that it 'll take 10 more year for them to get to greek level . 
  on the other hand i do n't think we should actively reduce to african-level poverty an eu country just because the troika has a bone with their gov & backers . 
   the romanian government cut salaries by 25 % it 's like the us senators , the upper ups do n't exactly live on their official wages . 
   increased taxes a lot yes , on those who have the money to pay them . 
  because rising it 's not the guys that make 300 $ / mo that are going to bring you more cash in . 
  edit : btw pensions and minimal wage seems to have risen in romania ? 
  well ; why ca n't we all live with less like the africans ? 
  after all i 'm sure people can just eat less and pay less rent/mortgage , less gaz for the car to go less to work and stop heating in winter and just cover more . 
  / s race to the bottom \u00b2 . 
   $ 8.5 million for the ` year of intercultural dialogue ' initiative , which included the donkeypedia project ; care to expand on that one ? 
   $ 97,000 to create a virtual malm\u00f6 on second life ; well that 's an example of one badly though project and waste , but i doubt an isolated mistake is going to change the budget  $ 1 million for a ` gender equal ' cultural centre , which was never built ; lol if it was n't built then they should take back the money . 
   a few years ago auditors found that eu funding for airports had been `` wasted '' on unused runways , boarding gates , car parks and cargo buildings that are `` not needed at all '' . 
  let 's not exagerate . 
  just because the use is n't instant or does n't jump to eyes does n't mean it is n't usefull . 
  airports ai n't going anywhere and are an investment . 
   `` we found that some airports were not profitable in the long term spoilers : public transport costs money . 
  they do n't bring it back with tickets but by allowing civilian life to goes on . 
  economies do n't survive without working roads & bridges & airport . 
   auditors checked a representative sample of 20 airports built , or modernised , in spain , greece , italy , poland and estonia at a cost to eu funds of $ 720 million , spent between 2000 and 2013 . 
  ahhh , there we go . 
  it 's in fact a disguised argument for austerity in the `` evil lazy money wasting southern countries '' . 
  pray tell , how does their economy is supposed to recover without transports ? 
  do freight magically appear at destination ? 
  i have to admit the whole article leaves me warry of what do qualify as waste or not . 
  please let 's not go in the corporate bullshit optic of `` if it does n't instantly bring back money fire the entire division '' . 
  it 's a race to the bottom . 
   try going to the bank and say `` i fulfill 90 % of the requirements for this loan . . what more can i do ??? '', 
  and see what they say it 's called a debt settlement . 
  and it happens more than you think ( especially with the crisis and people not being able to pay back their mortgage & other old debts etc ) . 
  generally banks accept because it 's that or default ( or bankruptcy , where they sometime get nothing more . ), 
  well , yeah , if people do n't have money because the 1 % hold it all , they do n't spend ; because they simply have nothing to spend . 
  it 's just greece finding new stuff because they 're actively cleaning house more than others . 
  it 's like when you hear constantly about arrests or new inquiries in romania or ` kraine . 
  it 's in fact a good sign imho  and germany pops up from time to times because they are simply a big economy ( one of the biggest around ) . 
  the delicious irony , all the euro skeptic anti union parties do unite themselves . 
  well i believe that 's the idea , but with libya for the lack of a sacrificial island . 
  like what ? 
  feel free to expand your post ( no sarcasm ), 
  joke apart , sweden ca n't take the entire libyan country . 
  so we 'll have to build ( open ) refugees camps there and send people there instead when recovered in the sea , and not in italy anymore . 
   should the relocation / money answer to be taken ... 
  i 'm talking for people already here we ca n't figure out where they are from . 
  italy + sweden ca n't handle the load alone either . 
  and i do n't think we should wait for renzi 's `` plan b '' . 
   i do n't understand why we do n't help italy over this , this is a european problem all of europea should help deal with these migrants with their fleets . 
  this .
