  the americans can either respect our health & safety standards or they wo n't get that treaty . 
  and no corporations mascarading as `` courts '' to `` award '' themselves hundreds of millions of euros of government money is not acceptable . 
  glad to hear ; but the problem is one might suspect the serbian gov to be corrupt and onboard for quick money, 
  not german obviously but here 's something i would hope is real and not just pr, 
  glad they caught him, 
  tolerence is one thing , but those al qaeda guys made their own choices in life , and terrible ones and are unrepentent at that . 
  who could think this is a good idea to invite them here ffs . 
  i agree , they 'd loose negociation potential on eu trade rules , the ttip and potentially trade volume depending on what they want to keep or not, 
  ^ ( this is how the stay could win haha :d ), 
   if you really think some minor changes to the level of welfare payment `` some minor changes to the level of welfare '' ? 
  what about the `` staying out of the euro as long as the uk want '' and `` staying out of the ever closer union as long as the uk wants '' and `` the eu has no right to pressure the uk on nether of those '' that the conservative asked so much repeatedly to have ? 
   for the billions we pour into the eu every year , which you actually get back in large part due to the agricultural subsidies but hey . 
  it 's not like france pours thrice as much money in the budgets de facto or anything y' know / s, 
  i do believe a large part of those is actually food and various supplies , because the donetsk & lugansk `` people 's republic '' have simply no economy to speak off ( while economy was something we focused upon in europe and a bit on kiev ; while russia still inherited the soviet legacy ) . 
  on that they 're probably a bit like transnistria . 
   potentially sanction the pardoned officials , bank account freezes , stop flow of loans for corrupting elections etc. 
  that actually look like a decent idea . 
   that 's not true , though . 
  the european commission had recommended several years in a row that the accession chapters should be opened . 
  no , i 'm saying this because yes they opened the paperwork but yes too ultra corrupt government officials stole most of the money and subsidies earmarked to work toward joigning the eu ; and they have actually no intention to do anything because then the money would stop flowing and/or if they do join it we 'll crack down on corruption/fraud/rampant theft . 
   it was greece who blocked us time and time again . 
  and when people ask where the stolen money is , why they do n't reform or even put concrete on the roads and why nothing moves and they still live like some african countries , they yell `` greece '' . 
  i 'm sorry but this is simply dishonest . 
  and now that roughly 100 of them got outed , the vote-rigging money stealing openly corrupt pm declare that they are `` pardoned '' and officially above the law . 
  so yeah people riot a bit i guess . 
  and part of the opposition is just as corrupt as the current gov and just trying to replace it to be the new thieves in charge of the gov bank accounts to loot them in turn soo ... 
   your mainly saying that because its israeli . 
  no , not at all . 
  i 'm saying this because the article using hyperboles and put things close in a way generally seen in propaganda . 
  the entire article is geared so that the reader reads the headlines and 5 lines in and think `` the palestinians must litterally support isis ! '' . 
  ( which fit in with dear leader netanyahu 's claim that the holocaust was the palestinian 's fault too : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/11951314/benjamin-netanyahus-claim-that-palestinians-caused-the-holocaust-is-a-ludicrous-distortion.html so now they are both litterally hitler and litterally isis !, 
  ai n't no propaganda there move along !, 
  / s ) the article fails to show how she `` refuses to condamn isis '' for example ( * let alone support it as hinted * ) yet repeat that claim multiples time and basically use it as it 's battle horse . 
  this is the kind of tricks you generally see in propaganda news . 
  mix that with several false reporting on their part ( erroneous news ) in the past year and yes i suspect them of running quiet propaganda . 
  ynet propaganda here now ? 
  what next , foxnews and sputnik edit : in simpler words for people that do n't get it : - the article repeat `` isis '' every 5 words - the student accused nor the palestinians said nothing about isis at all . 
  - yet the article go out of it 's way to link the student , isis and the palestinians . 
  come on and tell me this is n't basic propaganda . 
   david cameron was indeed humiliated fantasm much ? 
  looks like you simply want to see him replaced too so will take any excuse in favor . 
  that 's wishmaking at that point, 
   all told , jean-claude juncker should -- by now -- be wishing that he had given david cameron the deal that he wanted . 
  maybe that 's just me but i think the uk already got a decent deal . 
  any more would destabilize the rest of the eu because the uk would get too much and other countries would ask why the favoritism ( they have their own lists of demands too remember ? ) . 
  it 's obvious the eu in it 's current form is not quite what the uk wanted so now they 'll have to decide whether to stick with their agreements ( albeit with the concessions signed in the cameron agreement ) and stop perpetual anti-eu complaints or to leave it . 
   the pm 's demands were modest , opinion varies for the various demands . 
  some were , some were n't  came with a firm democratic mandate well , yes and no . 
  he got elected fair and square but not all electors agree on all his demands and program . 
  which is why the referendum is important , to see which way the popular wind is blowing . 
   a deal granting a looser alliance with britain and our northern european friends ( imagined in andrew marr 's brexit novel head of state ) would have made an ` in ' vote a certainty . 
  well once again some people in the uk confuse the eu with a mere loose trade agreement like the one between the usa & canada ...  cameron was humiliated at home not humiliated no , but both johnson and farage fancies themselves as a `` better '' prime minister so they would have found stuff to complain about and waged a propaganda war either way . 
   the largest polling firm in sweden , 36 per cent of the swedes would wish to leave the eu if brits vote to leave , and just 32 per cent would stay . 
  that does n't mean much interest in leaving at all . 
  it means the population is by large undecided as of now . 
  that 's likely to change over night if they start asking seriously themselves that question and i suspect most people would side with the `` stay '' part at around 60 % if they really had to choose, 
   ( new elections will be boycotted by social democrats because of the possibility of of vote maniplations ) well that 's stupid because if they expect the eu to just invest them in power somehow in a country that did n't even tried seriously to join the eu , they 're wrong . 
  why do n't they ask the eu to send osce observers and/or run the vote instead ( to ensure no fraud ) and ask civil society ( ie the protesters ) to push new candidates ? 
  that 'd make more sense . 
  glad to hear ; +300 m $ back in the coffers that 's good . 
  so the swedish gov dismissed him because they got tired of his ( racist , sexist , xenophobic , sectarians , ... ) comments i guess ? 
   its chalk and cheese just because you call things `` chalk '' and `` cheese '' or `` apples '' and `` oranges '' does n't make it so . 
   you have completely ignored what i said . 
  probably because it 's inexact  country that has always been a country uh . 
  if you never opened an history book in your life or bothered to check , ny ~ ~ c ~ ~ as both a country then state and it 's capital city predate the foundation of the usa by like a century . 
  and similarly , the uk only existed as a country since a few ( 5 ? 
  centuries too : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_formation_of_the_united_kingdom my best guess is history tends toward consolidation of similar cultures over time . 
  and i see the uk `` clamoring for independancy '' the same way texas rednecks are hanging a confederate flag in their bedroom and talking about `` washington 's oppression '' every 2 weeks , but hey i guess the english voters will decide on that . 
  well we 'll simply see which way it goes . 
  it 's roughly 50/50 odds currently . 
   then the nations making up the uk you 're underlining it yourself . 
  border sometime changes ( in a peacefull manner ) . 
  even the uk is made of multiple sub countries including england and scotland . 
  itt people pretending they `` know '' that `` 99 % of people will vote absolutely vote leave '' . 
  you 're a bit delusional, 
  more seriously , semi stealth planes doing random point-blank manoeuvers without transponders or coms and voluntarily brushing targets is simply a major collision accident risk ... ( which would utterly destroy * both * planes ) i 'm half expecting a preventable accident at some point because a pilot 's hand slipped for half a sec or there was a fancy gust of wind, 
   would n't that mean that only countries like france and the uk i 'm pretty sure the uk will try to find another rule-lawyering way to weasle out of taking migrants  i doubt there are many say polish or estonian speaking people . 
  some might learn it just for that purpose ; but if so at least that 'll reduce the communication & integration hurdle by an order of magnitude and prove those people as motivated, 
   redirect african foreign aid towards a european fund for african development . 
  that 's a good idea , that would help having an eye on it to ensure the money is not stolen or misled . 
  if people thought western corruption was bad , i 'd point out the biggest part of aid spending was probably misled ...  only open to speakers of the language of the country they would immigrate to , and that have attended an introductory course . 
  definitely helpfull for integration too what you quote seems a good idea indeed , i 'm not surprized it 's welcome, 
   the london mayor , who backs eu exit , told the bbc the americans `` would n't dream of sharing [ their ] sovereignty '' as the uk had done . 
  uh , that 's completely , utterly false and they do . 
  that 's what states are doing under the federal governement . 
  if we compare the uk for example with the state of new york ( both have a prominent finance centred capital , respectively london and new york city ) , they both have a federal gov above their state . 
   mr johnson also reiterated his view that mr cameron should stay on as prime minister even if voters backed leaving . 
  that 's up to mr cameron imho . 
   `` a massive opportunity to ... burst out of the shackles of brussels '' . 
  as the monthy pythons humorists once put it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uzgencr3q0  and he claimed the union was corrupt . 
  well now coming from the uk wannabe-futur - ~ ~ first ~ ~ prime-minister that 's a funny one after the panama papers ( http://www.euronews.com/2016/04/04/the-panama-papers-a-british-problem-a-british-crisis/ ? ), 
   however , labour mp and remain campaigner chuka umunna accused mr johnson of posing as a `` champion of the nhs '' while supporting spending cuts . 
  oh , but here i thought it was the eu that was saying one thing and doing another ? 
  i certainly welcome it . 
  one could imagine most european budgets going back to surplus in the end , without more austerity . 
   children should n't be forced to believe anything until they decide for themselves . 
  well , yes and no : i guess we could do a school chapter on isis like we did on the rise of nazism during wwii , to point out it 's a bad thing, 
  excellent , going clean on this is the best way to go forward without that skeleton in the closet ( before it actually becomes embarassing ), 
  spirit of the law vs letter of the law \u00b2 people are expected to follow the first one in most countries, 
   [ eh ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4cfquv/how_western_is_turkey_are_majority_of_turks/d1huwxb ) those raids had the law enforcement forces looking for classified information , not for people who insulted the local leader ...
