  if they ca n't go to school because they ca n't afford it , if they ca n't do it because they had ~ ~ dissentry ~ ~ a cold and died of it because even tylenol was too costly ; if they ca n't because they ended up homeless one week in loosing their last job ; they would never have created that economy . 
  so , if you really want to `` create jobs '' , you want that money to go to welfare , social security , keeping free schools , unemployment , etc. 
  not giving it to people already very wealthy who do n't need it to actually run their projects and could already borrow to a bank if they needed . 
   the idea is for the government to protect the welfare , basically , yes  the financial health of the state which is dependant on tax collection & cracking down on evasion  and help companies grow and expand annnd not by giving money to them , no . 
  this is not a function people have in mind when they elect a democratic governement actually representing them to some degrees . 
  that 's where neoliberalism come from . 
  they added that idea and use it as an argument to abolish the tax system that maintain 's it health ( and therefore damaging said state ) . 
  on the economic side , the main role of the state is to collect those taxes on most people and redistribute them as welfare in scandinavia . 
  not to give billions in tax breaks and billions in subsidies ( ie budget looting ) they generally get in the us by giving bribes ( oh sorry , `` campaign contributions '' ) to well placed politicians ( and now every politicians nowadays as a result since it 's becoming accepted and common practice ) . 
   ** without state-private sector cooperation sweden would n't be where they are now . 
  ** ** actually , again , no ** : ** in fact , no it 's not the private sector that recovered and saved their economic ** and act as an economic engine . 
  it 's the public one , that 's still nowadays a good 30 % ( 50 % at the time ? ), 
  of employments in sweden : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_sector it acts as the real economic engine partly by being a door stopper to the worst private sector excesses , by maintaining low prices & concurrence on some key goods like utilities , and creating a large hiring sector that paid a living no matter what and do n't try to scrounge every last seconds or pennies out of it 's employees . 
  it 's a secure way of garranteeing an income to a major part of the population even when the private sector is too busy not paying anyone a living `` because we have no money '' . 
  if private wage is too low or conditions too shit , in north european countries people can simply quit and work for the public sector instead . 
  and when all companies are shit , they crash in mass but the public sector survive and grow . 
  which is what happened . 
  - it 's also the fact they did n't hesitated to take money from said private sector ( now that it 's growing again after they ended their excesses ) and redistribute it that saved their economy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_sweden  sweden is a competitive mixed economy featuring a generous universal welfare state financed through relatively high income taxes that ensures that income is distributed across the entire society , a model sometimes called the nordic model . 
  the large private sector is needed too obviously , whether for innovation , driving down prices in honest competition ( one that can only exist if there is a concurrent they ca n't sink down by illegal means or dumping , like a state ran company ) , offering similarly competition in the hiring sector ( which again can only exist if there is no monopoly of the private sector like in the us where `` public company '' and `` nationalization '' are synonymous with `` communism '' ) , or filling whatever need the gov did not/could not think of . 
  but , again , regulation against excess is needed and it 's a large public sector , public hirings , public wages and welfare that kind of saved their economy out of nowhere . 
  not trickle down 's `` abolish all your public state run concurrents , let us do whatever we want and we 'll maybe create jobs if you give us billions in breaks and subsides on top of it '' and force people to work for pennies by abolishing unemployment money like some love to push ( so they can then steal it too as `` subsidies '' and `` tax breaks '' ) . 
   true , but this is unrelated to the point we 're talking about . 
  i mean you use finance like the russians use oil . 
  it 's not skill , it 's just luck and exports . 
  and if you void the eu finance regulations after leaving the eu , you could loose access to the eu-linked markets and therefore loose most of your finance base . 
   and 5.3 % were underemployed ( so are working less hours than they would like to ) that 's surprizing or does n't count the zero hours contract . 
  i mean , there 's an entire wikipedia page dedicated to that specific problem that you can read here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-hour_contract#united_kingdom  eported in august 2013 that as many as 1 million workers in the united kingdom , 3 -- 4 % of the workforce , work under the terms of a zero-hour contract . 
  the zhc ... alone ... is 4 % of the working population in the uk . 
  so , add all the other form of crappy contracts and non zhc small time jobs and you can probably more than triple that statistic . 
  i 'm talking about a potential 15/20 % extreme precarity . 
  now , add the existant unemployment ( 5 % ? 
  ) , rising unemployment ( +5 % in 10 years ? 
  ) , and all the illegal undeclared work ( http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/07_undeclared_work_02.pdf ) that make up a good 10 % of the uk 's economy that generally like to consider minimal wage ( already insufficient to live in a big part of the uk ) a set of guidelines more than laws ; and you 're looking at 40 % of the workers not earning a living . 
  to me , combine 40 % of the work age population not earning a living with a systematic welfare and tax dismantling in the name of neoliberalism ; with a huge dash of rising poverty that 'd make the tatcher strikes era proud ; that says `` social trouble '' . 
  but hey , better rig the unemployment & precarity statistics , ignore the problem , keep deregularizing/helping corporations evading taxes and stealing welfare money `` because they do n't deserve it they 're lazy and can just work instead '' , right ? 
  / s then add a financial crash on top if the uk leave and do wtf and decide to ignore regulations and close their own door to our cash flows . 
  sorry , i should have clarified , i meant the turkish governement ; not the entire country 's population, 
   the swedish model does n't work because they tax and redistribute , it works because there is a strong private sector that employs , produces and exports . 
  that 's the usual `` neoliberal '' ( pro `` free market '' ) propaganda that argue that the taxes have nothing to do with it ; because they 'd rather pocket that money and be more wealthy themselves ; even if it kills yet another series of country . 
   focus on welfare before job creation and the result is debt and unemployment . 
  that 's simply not true ; scandinavia having one of the biggest focus on welfare in the world . 
  and the results shows . 
  their society is litterally built on their social safety net . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare_state#effects_of_welfare_on_poverty  sweden 23.7 ( poverty rate before they got their welfare system ) 5.8 ( poverty rate after )  finland 11.9 3.7  france 36.1 9.8 pretty much the proof it 's what removed poverty in their country and therefore kept the demand level enough to keep supply on . 
   the uk already had a flexible labour market based around finance . 
  if finance crash , your entire economy could disappear overnight . 
  there is little diversification . 
   and our unemployment is still at record lows among both natives and foreigners . 
  unemployement being low because a lot of that `` employment '' is zero paid hours garranted contracts or things that do n't allow you to eat . 
  if you get paid 50 # a week for 5h you are out of the `` unemployment '' statistic but your still just as screwed and have to leave london/whatever big town pretty fast and find something else . 
   there are plenty of opportunities and new companies that could be started . 
  well if you have no client because they have no money either , not really . 
  try starting a company in greece for example . 
   but the swedes managed because their social model collect `` high '' ( not really but , existant ) taxes and redistribute them as welfare . 
  while greek welfare was systematically dismantled at absolutely every level ( whether it 's social security , pensions , age of retirement , etc etc ) so that the money could be sent to ( already wealthy ) creditors instead . 
   why do you think it 's so high in france and most of continental europe ? 
  machines do the work of many people at a fraction of the cost . 
  whether it is harvesters vehicules or excel spreadsheets for accounting or assembly lines pumping hundreds of car with a dozen employees ; when it 's not china showing us how to build high end smartphones for less than 15 $ ( the one you buy 200 $ in shops . ), 
  by the millions . 
  we have enough wealth floating around to already feed the population a hundred time ( the european gdp is in dozens of trillions . ), 
  but at some point there simply wo n't be enough jobs for everyone to get a wage . 
  so either we 'll collect some of that money as taxes ( which means cracking down on the colossal amount of fraud and it 's new and current brand name , `` evasion '' ) , and keep giving welfare with it instead of wages to those who do n't have one , or everybody will live in slums and the economy will crash shortly after because if nobody has an income nobody buys anything no matter the price . 
  see it as the problem of having 0 $ to your name but walking the alleyways of a lot of shops with shelf full of stuff but nobody ca n't afford any of it societywide so a couple years later the shop has to close down too . 
  he speaks broken french ( thick accent , eat some words , do n't decline etc ) ; but it 's understandable/usable ; you obviously can hold conversation with him in french and he understands it . 
  stuttering and similar could be attributed to speaking in public in a language he does n't speak perfectly while people try to corner him verbally i guess , it 's excusable, 
  a large part want a referendum to consolidate the fact that their opinion is democratically supported to stay in . 
  most people in france in fact are n't ( albeit , currently ) in favor of leaving . 
  damn , i 'm happy they 're finally admitting it 's a bad thing to destroy work laws in europe ( `` liberalization '' and `` deregulation '' ) and reducing everybody 's wages . 
  now whether they 'll act on it ... ( ps and your mek law , i 'm looking at you ... ), 
  still , i see the country get a check of 200 ' 000 ' 000 $ so i think it 's a positive move ( i just hope it 'll not end up stolen by corruption ; but that bit is not turkey 's fault at all , more of a barzani one )  a cut in the pipeline would drop the oil production of iraki to almost 0 , theorically they should have a part of the iraqi federal budget but ...  threatening the stability of the autonomous government and the peshmerga army it 's true they definitely have a financial problem ( and unpaid/late wages as of late ), 
  positive news about turkey for once ; ca n't say i complain about that one tho ( especially if they fund the krg , 
  you 're happy now that you 're independant . 
  a couple centuries ago people were busy dropping tea in the harbor as the us love to remind old europe ;-) then stuff like : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebellions_of_1837 but it 's true canada/uk went nicer than other areas, 
   you do n't need to try to rationalize your xenophobia . 
  because i criticize some of what erdogan say or do now it 's `` xenophobia '' ? 
  holy hell  then why did the europeans refuse turkey back when akp was n't this strong and the country was ruled mostly by the secular people ? 
  probably because different people where in charge at the time and it 's almost like most of them turn seats in a democraty ... also notice how at the time turkey 's chances where 10x bigger and how he was a lot more liked there ? 
  and for all the time wasted was the same for everyone else , it always took like 30y to join the eu ... the other states just started getting closer 50y/60y ago after the end of wwii so they had a bit of head start, 
  i never said ( or thought ) anything remotely like some `` race theory '' ; and the pacific ocean countries i listed are at the opposite end of the planet so so much for that idea . 
  the main point i see common is a lack of extreme religious belief and a will to rebuild their country, 
  the colonisation excuse only go so far . 
  canada & the usa were colonised too yet succeeded . 
  japan or sk did even better in the span of 50 years . 
  china was invaded by half the neighboring countries in their history yet now sit as a world power too . 
  singapore was an uk colony . 
  so was australia . 
  new zealand . 
  etc hell ; even vietnam recovered to a correct degree after utterly brutal decolonization warfare ( french indochine independance war , which was probably as brutal as the current scw ) , revenge largescale economic destruction & followed by the even more brutal vietnam war . 
  it 's a recovery/correction . 
  so yes it 's `` big '' because they should never have faced a depression that deep in the first place . 
  it 's just heading back to `` normal '' economic levels . 
  ignoring the crash and it sector bailed out in exchange for snapback garrantees of keeping factories there ( if they delocalize the factories outside of europe it 's all seized . 
  ) ; real gdp growth on average is probably like 2 % . 
  edit : the government balance is n't the same number as the gdp , but i think it reflect quite well the real situation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-2008_irish_economic_downturn#/media/file:government_surplus_or_deficit_since_2001_ ( piiggs_and_us ) . svg a huge crash followed by a climb back of the economy edit growth chart with possible speculations on the futur https://www.quandl.com/data/oda/irl_ngdp_rpch-ireland-gdp-at-constant-prices-change.png, 
   that is a pretty common view among european conservatives if you are talking about the tea party like mentality and the evangelist ; well fuck them ; how about they live their own life instead of trying to force their own crass taliban-like religious prohibitions on everyone else that is n't them or interested in it at all  nor alien to the conservative mindset in the west ( both in europe and the us ) . 
  see above \u00b2, 
   i was talking about were made by erdogan but by his wife are they independant on the subject ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure what 's going on in his household and do n't care enough to try finding out ; but in western countries on public speeches such speeches would definitely be coordinated and decided together . 
  for example you can be sure bill clinton had a hand in hillary 's speeches at least years ago . 
  same in france when people where joking that chirac 's wife was leading the country .
