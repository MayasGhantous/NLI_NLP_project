  now he 's busy building mosques everywhere on state money , turkish nato weapons appear in nusra ( al qaeda ) 's hands ( and no i 'm not talking about theft ) , journalists jailed on a weekly basis , corruption state backed and that kind of dinosaure comments are recurrent . 
   eu is in deep shit , it 's not the shiny union it was , it 's crumbling even when `` crumbling '' we have a hundred time your economy and still have a bigger gdp than the usa . 
   that the majority of turkish citizens do n't even support joining the eu of course , and iran was so much more happy under embargo singing `` death to america and israel ! '' . 
  most of it yes . 
  which is why parts of the middle east and africa are still a hell hole . 
  corruption 's the main problem just behind the invasion ; that much is clear . 
  and that part is very much an ukrainian-sourced problem, 
  if you want the blunt truth ; this , turkey ( edit : i mean the gov ) , is why people are n't willing to see you in europe . 
  your religious extremist fundamentalist views straight ouf the medieval dark ages a thousand years in the past . 
  the rest of the world moved on from that , so please do the same with extreme religion and such prehistoric views . 
  edit : good points too from a turkish redditor : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a18cw/turkish_first_lady_praises_ottomanera_harem_for/d0wx4ef?context=3 it 's possible the article was n't entirely honest in retranscribing their words, 
  what word would you use instead ? 
  must be like christmas for the intelligence community edit : word, 
   i did n't , the majority of greeks hate turks - i believe any greek here can confirm that for me . 
  non greek here but the golden dawn i had the displeasure to watch are basically the greek equivalent of the turkish grey wolves ( it 's the name they give to themselves , no joke ) . 
  fanatics . 
  they thankfully do n't represent most greeks as of now ; and the guy got expelled as punishment for the racist insults, 
  no , as usual they want to sacrifice unemployment & pension & welfare money to pay the demands of that medef tax frauder millionaire lobbyist named gattaz . 
  i 'm kind of highly disgusted by the whole thing . 
  they basically want to make greece ii with us without even the debts just to enrich more the guy & his cronies who pretend he 'll `` create more jobs '' in exchange for those 35 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 $ and that it might depending on their mood `` trickle down in the economy '' . 
  i see the whole thing as corruption & theft at that point ( a 35b annual hold up ) ; but obviously most people in the gov seems to disagree . 
  yeah most of the `` magic '' is basically happening in budget spreadsheets trying to make numbers go round, 
   taxes today across the developed world are much higher than they were in the immediate post-war period . 
  they would be , [ if every single company with any amount of money was n't using an off shore shell company system to evade them all ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20580545 ) , up to and including vat a couple years ago . 
  nowadays , only citizens and small business with nobody to handle the paper work pay them honestly . 
  po boxes in ~ ~ luxembourg ~ ~ switzerland , ~ ~ monaco ~ ~ or bahamas etc is the rule for the largest part of corporate cash flows : [ facebook paid # 4,327 corporation tax in 2014 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34504474 ), 
  yeah . 
  but i still do n't know how the government imagine they 'll find those * additionnal * 35 billions euro they decided to give to the medef each years , by the end of the year, 
  it 's not the inflation or germany 's fiscality that worries me the most right now but the ps 's ( france 's party in power ) retarded `` work law '' that vandalize our work code that they try pushing right now . 
  ( a law that basically says that they do n't have to pay taxes anymore in a lot of cases - not that they did n't frauded them already but it 's now legal ... - ; that abolish sunday and make it another work day , that encourage employers to ask you to come working at night ( but your 're not paid more for any of that work . 
  ) , enormously rise maximal length on work shifts at like 48h de facto , etc. 
  there have already been petitions of 1.5 + millions protestors , 2m in the streets and the minister which they force pushing it has so much pression she has constant seizures and 3 hospitalisations in 10 days ; but nooo our gov decided they would offer that law and yet another additionnal 35 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 $ a year of tax breaks to employers lobbies ; great / s f ` in neoliberalism, 
   even-though european government spends an ever increasing portion of the tax payers money we stagnate . 
  probably because they only spend it on people who do n't need it , like megacorps getting subsidies and corrupt defense spending with 99 % + margins and where tanks are sold 1500x their value ( i mean , when the french navy can buy a stealth frigate for the price the greeks bought a single tank to a certain country , you have a problem . ) . 
   while most european governments run a unsustainable budget deficit probably if we cutted those corporate subsidies and corruption as a start that 'd help ? 
   france have had a 30 years continuous budget deficit - this is n't merely a unsustainable but also a generational theft . 
  actually the deficit was frequently below inflation . 
  at our current point where running a defacto less than 2 % deficit once you count in the fact that we 're borrowing money at a * negative * rate . 
  ( then there 's the fact that we are bankrolling like 6 countries under the table and a big part of the eu budget . 
  once that 's not going to be a problem in a decade or so because other countries like spain or ireland finally recover ... ), 
  3b extra is nearly reasonable , alright . 
  we should pay it i think, 
   abolish minimum wage , social security and pensions , ban trade unions and we can become competitive again overnight . 
  then you have a 50 $ / month wage , medecine still costs thousands , and first thing serious you are dead . 
  and it 's going to be painfull because you ca n't even afford tylenol . 
  oh and [ do n't forget to come back saturday at 3:00 am or you are fired and we replace you with a pakistani or african for half that ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/amazon-used-neo-nazi-guards-to-keep-immigrant-workforce-under-control-in-germany-8495843.html ) ( thankfully it was before germany reinstated minimal wage ), 
  i 'm totally convinced by your well rounded argument . 
  pray tell , how would the economy have recovered in europe if the marshall plan money was never distributed ? 
  it could n't had . 
  how would poland be an economic powerhouse now if the eu never had lended them hundreds of billions of tax money at every level ? 
  it could n't had . 
  was poland caught up in any recent war ? 
   the baby boom happened because huge amounts of money were being spent rebuilding economies after the war . 
  furthermore , many economies were operating very efficiently , again , due to the war . 
  it 's less the war and more that the gov was willing to spend money paying people and actually collect taxes on the wealthy to run said reconstruction programs . 
  they could have paid them to do anything else and avoided the war and it would have ben the same . 
  but now the gov paying people is called `` communism '' or `` lazy mooching '' or `` parasits looking for a handout '' and taxation of capital `` theft '' by some very wealthy people who write the law at the senate ( who subsequently give instead all that money to their wealthy buddies as `` subsidies '' ) . 
  well looking at how turkey managed to build quite decent camps on very little money [ with prefab ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/turkey-367889.jpg ) ; i 'm sure we could do better than `` some crappy '' without ruining them . 
  there 's no reasons the eu ca n't give them a hand with logistics . 
  but agreed, 
   eu should be pouring billions into greece to help them cover the costs of camps agreed . 
  we might as well give remaining money to greece to run those . 
  it 'd boost a bit of their economy to some degree at least . 
   you assume those gorillas are smart enough to default the loans , let alone knowing what a default is . 
  yet that 's part of what they announced : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11741814/golden-dawn-mp-furiously-tears-up-papers-in-parliament-over-bailout-deal.html it 's easy to simply underestimate them as `` apes '' but that 's dangerous too, 
   so what are they going to do about it ? 
  voting [ golden dawn ] ( http://www.channel4.com/media/images/channel4/c4-news/2013/september/28/28_goldendawn_g_w.jpg ) , which will restore their beloved greek right wing junta from the 70 's & abolish democraty ; junta which will promptly default on you . 
  the point is to keep them alive and well . 
  she ca n't do that if she loose her post or they run out of political good will at home . 
  mostly in germany ; in france our middle east immigrants tend to speak arabic instead when they do n't speak the local language ( or english ) . 
  but sure why not ; as a french i 'd not be opposed to the idea of making it another official eu language . 
  what do the other countries think of the demand ? 
  but ignoring too much the will of the population could lead to a bit of social instability & your downfall mme merkel ; and if you loose your post you wo n't be able to help much more people . 
   why they do n't like france ? 
  french is an annoyingly hard language to learn for a lot of people and you need to register and go in system ( and then the uk will deport them to france on sight if caught in the uk without a valid visa/passport/authorization ) ; and they can get slightly more money in the uk and already speak english and have family there . 
  so they 'd rather attempt as illegal in the uk in a number of cases . 
  the border getting closed , ongoing dismantling of the camp and the uk turning them back slowly change their mind and remove some of the pull tho . 
   it 's like clearing a campsite of 3,500 aggressive and hostile people . 
  you 're halving the real number ( about 7000 ), 
   more compatible with human rights is towing ships back to their point of origin : australia succeeded with this method . 
  that would also work yes ; wonder why we 're not doing it at that point : / turkey 's largely safe too , and that could help calm a large amount of pressure on merkel currently . 
  well if the us with all their ressources still ca n't find el chapo or dismantle the mexican cartels , it means it 's going to be even harder for us ; especially with the north african mafia having a serious hand in marseilles ( let alone talking about the italian one in italy ), 
  when there is 30 % unemployment in `` banlieux '' ( poortown suburbs ) no there is n't always that option . 
  and of the 60 % that work for a part it 's more like a part time so it 's more 400 $ . 
  when lucky enough to have long term job . 
  so of course if they can get as much per day from the mafia peddling coke ... edit : 30 % unemployment there sorry , just checked  but what is a borring job barrely offering 1000 $ / month when drug dealing gives you that much within 3 or 4 days of `` work '' ... pretty much . 
  so pushing them to legalization and rising wages in other jobs/offering welfare would go quite a bit to fight the problem . 
  well that 's exactly why it 's so prevalent in poor suburb . 
  a lot deal drug because there 's no legit way for a lot of youth there to have an income . 
  so of course when mafias offer them a way to make 100-500 $ / day after a few years of high poverty and 10 years of unemployment , they take it . 
  and that 's why the locals tends to cover mafias , it 's the living of entire neighborhoods . 
  so if you think just keeping a % age of your population in prison constantly like the us and not giving anyone any ressources is going to fix the problem , you 're going to have a bad time . 
  that map is probably not exhaustive , or does n't include well known hidden money or is only counting raw cash : - dassault is likely richer in france since he 's the one getting the money from dassault weapon & aeronautics industries . 
  but lots of is probably not cash and/or ca n't be really moved around lest we catch him and the fisc ( irs ) ask for what he actually owes as taxes . 
  and that industry is heavily regulated . 
  - kolomo\u00efsky is definitely richer in ukraine ( the dnipro region might as well be called kolomoiskypetrovsk and the guy collect passports like some collect travels abroad ) - usmanov 's definitely not the richest man in russia haha - ingvar kamprad is probably weighting 40b in sweden ( but of course he 's busy pretending he 's not rich and that it 's a taxfree offshore company that owns ikea and not him ; riiiiiight / s ), 
   well even small time drug dealing , pick-pocketing , petty theft etc petty theft and drug dealing are a symptom of poverty . 
  you do n't make hunger disappear by beating people when they starve and try to steal bread or sell drug to buy it . 
  the only thing they 'll try harder is not getting caught . 
  that 's a problem that can only be seriously addressed with policies addressing poverty .
