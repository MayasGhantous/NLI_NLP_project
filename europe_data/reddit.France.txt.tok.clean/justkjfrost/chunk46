   is that adequate ? 
  did he learn his lesson ? 
  does this protect society enough ? 
  because thus behavior is almost acceptable where he comes from and the already pretty short prison stay wo n't bee to uncomfortable for him either . 
  concerning serious crimes like that ( which are n't justifiable in any cases ) , i think you are right tho . 
   essentially has no victims ( unless they are sold to minors ) , it 's not entirely true : drug addicts are the victim of heavy drug trade . 
  but it should be handled like alcoolism : people should be sent to rehab and helped , not sent prison or otherwise punished and further destroyed . 
  because that 's just victim blamming , and politicians moving the fault off badly handling social problems on the victim and pushing them in jail to forget about it and them hoping that drug addicts will magically solve the social problems for them ( `` beatings will continue until moral improves '' ) . 
  addicts obviously can not solve that problem themselves , so the only thing we can honestly push for is abolishing the penalty and instead bolstering help and encouraging people to take it . 
  then we can try cracking down on cartels , but it 's significantly harder because they generally have lots of friends in politics covering for them , and for that you have to take down the corrupt politicians and their oligarchic buddies that run that drug trade generally . 
  and sometime those kingpins are in other countries that are n't friendly toward the eu or usa like some african regimes or south america ( colombia , ... ) or somewhere in mexico or morocco so it 's even harder ... 
  i mean , the us are still looking for goddam el chapo . 
  legalizing and legislating heavily/regulating it like tobacco for a number of `` low risk '' might help reduce the problem tho : if they have to buy it in a tobacco shop instead , it allows to ban sales to minors like for smokes , put limits on dangerous products , maximal doses , or control health of users , refers people to hospitals/doctors when needed if they want it , etc. 
  that would also stop funding the african mafia with that much money and you could even tax it . 
  and yeah kids smoke and drink illegally too ; but at least it 's in lower amounts that if you could n't watch sales that potentially go to minors , and tobacco shop product is safer product that unregulated street crap cut with glass sand , washing powder , dirt , gasoline and donkey dung . 
  addressing poor suburb poverty would also help teenagers and youths staying away or leaving the drug money circles and get themselves a less shady life . 
  how about working towards both \\* shrugs \\* but it 's true that if europe runs out of cash we wo n't be very helpfull for anyone so a bit of pragmatism is sometime needed with budget sums that large . 
  15b can do a lot more good that can offset those weapons in hands of the qataris . 
  spain and portugal said they had some space ? 
  in french https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/47ub9t/barcelone_sindigne_du_retard_de_larriv%c3%a9e_des/ if greece is too stuck they might want to talk to them ? 
  of course it 's a 100 % safe country , but jobs are hard to come by ( 50 % unemployment ; ie they 'll get a roof and food but no real money ; even if the country is kept running ) so informing everyone of that reality might help making the area unattractive for economic migrants, 
  that depend what you call crime . 
  but it 's true we might have to ant up the pressure a bit on * violent * crime . 
  such as assault , injuries , murder , sexual assault , support for islamist terrorism , etc. 
   they reduced fines to such low levels that it made tax evasion profitable for businesses . 
  unsurprisingly , there 's now a $ 183m . 
  black hole in tax revenues . 
  oh come on . 
  this is n't even funny syriza ffs : /, 
   however , howard 's backing of brexit might not be completely straightforward . 
  he also writes in his telegraph column that voting to leave might `` shake europe 's leaders out of their complacency '' and force them to offer britain a better deal to stay in . 
  uh , well . 
  we already made a deal largely in favor of the uk with mr cameron imho . 
  but i do n't think we 'll make yet another even more imbalanced . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ how ^ ^ you ^ ^ make ^ ^ romania ^ ^ great ^ ^ again, 
  the guy was obviously joking and refering to the usual meme . 
  `` you know who did n't drank ? 
  hitler that 's who ! '', 
  they 'd have to pay the smugglers again for that . 
  generally they ca n't afford it especially when they know they wo n't make anywhere near that money in europe, 
   oh i agree , but good luck convincing european governments that rocking the boat now and causing a massive shitstorm is better than being forced to do it in 20 years . 
  preemptive political measures are n't all that popular in europe right now ( or anywhere really ) . 
  well it 's exactly what they are doing with that paid imam system  even between sects that are n't very fond of eachother like twelver shi'a / alawites and salafists , they still have quite a lot of ideological thought in common ( they all still adhere to islam ) . 
  you 're saying that you can see the difference between 2 people and `` they 're all browns '' essentially . 
  oh but i 'm sure orthodox russians in the kremlin & protestant americans in the pentagon have a lot in common , after all they 're all christians / s  i think it 's far more likely that belgium will backtrack as soon as the discontent becomes evident . 
  that 's possibly , but in that case the saudi imam problem would remain unaddressed  what makes you think they 'll want to do even more ? 
  the fact they finally took money to do it . 
  it 's the only real sign that matter to indicate whether anything is moving or not in occident . 
  wants to see whether they 'll act and how , follow the budget or lack of thereof to accompany words ... 
  clearly . 
  and if you do n't feel like preaching like for the prophet [ i would also suggest us megachurchs as an alternative ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/13/living/creflo-dollar-jet-feat/ ) :d, 
   the problem is you would n't just be fighting against the isis-friendly imams and adherents , but also against the entire clerical/imam establishment , which has a vested interest in disregarding this entire initiative . 
  then they can come get some . 
  it 'll be wayyyyy cheaper than fighting the entire integration/assimilation/daesh-like extremism problem 20 years later . 
   yet for some reason people believe they can attempt to suppress the extremists ( the real hardcore isis supporters ) and that the whole problem will just fix itself . 
  no , it 's only part of the solution . 
  but if you do n't suppress extremists and they decide to blow up stuff , you loose more . 
   as there is no magical line that divides islam from isis islam ( or even al-qaeda islam or salafism or whatever other sect within a sect ) no exageration either there of course / s `` all muslims are litterally daesh baby burners ! '', 
  / s my god , you 're just as obtuse as some salafists in your own manner . 
   also , how do you think muslims in general are going to respond to this ? 
  this is going to be a law , not a polite question . 
   do you really believe they 're going to see this attempt by european governments at controlling their faith as awesome well the door remains open if they disagree that much  i would n't be surprised if this fuels even more extremism blatant exageration . 
  deporting extremists imams and preventing the saudis from appointing daeshi-like salafists as new imams will reduce it more than allowing them to continue , sorry . 
  what ? 
  lol ; they 're not headed to belgium . 
  this is propaganda . 
  i mean maybe a few isolated ones did but that 's it  for the bulldozers to be put on hold until shelter is found for some 340 unaccompanied minors : `` we urgently need a plan to be put in place to shelter these children . '', 
  * pokes the gov * how about put them in an hotel and we continue ? 
  and for the younger ones , the ddass ( orphanage ) if no parents can be found in country . 
   `` we must provide a humanitarian response to the situation in calais , '' the prime minister , manuel valls , said . 
   `` we are in the process of evacuating methodically ... because we ca n't accept the terrible conditions in which the migrants are living ... and we ca n't continue to have a shanty-town on the edge of calais , '' he added . 
  100 % with valls, 
  well that did n't seemed to bother austrians either : http://www.thelocal.at/20141015/jihadi-teens-face-five-years-jail  the two teen girls who joined jihadists in syria , then changed their minds and now want to return to austria , face up to five years in jail for supporting a terrorist organization , according to a report in the news daily heute . 
  altho , admittedly , the charge would n't be as high as for fighters , war crimes , unrepentant or older people . 
  well the whole point would be to fire & replace those very isis-friendly people ; and to prevent the saudis from buying too impoverished imams to be more extremists . 
  joigning a terrorist group ( especially an anti western one that wants to , quoting them , start the biblical apocalypse and commit routine genocide attempts ) does qualify for numerous years in jail . 
   i should n't bother arguing with you , because you sound like a moron . 
  well ; we can watch the uk vote . 
  if they leave and abolish eu financial regulations and you get kicked out of the eu markets and subsequently insta crash ; i 'll be the one laughing with an insufferable `` told you so ''  ^ ^ ^ likely ^ ^ ^ followed ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ twenty ^ ^ ^ internal ^ ^ ^ crisis ^ ^ ^ reunions, 
  but your empire you used to leech upon to finance that center is gone . 
  german , french , italian , cyprus , ... state led banks are the ones placing money there . 
  partly to subsidise and keep your economy running because otherwise it 'd look like russia without gaz . 
  do you know how much money in that finance sector of yours comes from the rest of the eu ? 
  the one you happen to forgot to diversify . 
  please give me your own numbers . 
  but i 'm sure those 8b overshadow everything else / s, 
  lots of boris johnson followers are already pretending to everybody who wants to hear `` it 's all going to be milk & honey in a few years once the evil intrusive eu stop limitating us '' and that somehow free money will fall from the sky and roads be paved with gold `` once we stop wasting money funding the eu '' . 
  it 's almost as if they forgot they 're in fact a net receiver once you factor in some things like food aid , agricultural aid and some other things and that adding autarcy on top of it and libertarian politics is not exactly going to help anyone ( apart maybe the rich top ) . 
  she gets to be home alright . 
  likely in prison . 
  but hey she gets to live and not being under air strikes . 
  yeah but then the next economic crash in the uk wo n't be our responsability if they get out . 
  the disguised gop-like `` neoliberal '' libertarians that make up half the conservatives will have the privilege to have to try to glue everything back together . 
  i 'm sure it 's going to work well without any welfare , unemployment revenue or nhs as they are busy advocating to `` suppress the lazy non working parasites '' / s : ddd, 
  not really . 
  at least we get info on the situation and one less family wondering wtf is going on and why we do n't address their case . 
  my point is the uk conservatives are ~ ~ always ~ ~ sometime complaining just to make noise and blame the eu for whatever ( the `` lack of democraty '' just being the latest excuse ) but do n't really want a solution because then they 'd loose their perfect scapegoat for their own screw ups . 
  cameron was actually looking for reform ; but others not so much . 
   it has become an argument not easily refuted . 
  well if they vote to stay , they 'll have made a democratic choice of being in the current eu ( in respect of the recent cameron ~ ~ treaty ~ ~ agreement of course ) despite a few shortcomings soo ...
