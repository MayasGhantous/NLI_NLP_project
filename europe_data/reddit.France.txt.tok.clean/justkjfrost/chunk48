  oh and uk farmers would likely loose all eu farming subsidies since they would n't contribute in our budget anymore . 
  ... have you seen how the jihadis who hijacked the fsa run northern idlib ? 
  they 're basically taliban material ; and that is when they 're not ksa-imported actual afghan talibans mujahideen . 
  you sure tens of thousands of armed talibans are n't going to be a problem if they stick in southern turkey without at least confiscating all the weapons ? 
  pakistan is a good example of that problem . 
  hence why they talked about pakistanisation . 
   turkey does not have a big problem with crime and illegal weapons but they will soon once the jihadis leave northern aleppo and/or idlib because the wind is turning and/or they do n't want to stay inactive during a cease fire ( because when a war is over one way or another jihadis tends to export themselves in other countries ) . 
  and all those jihadis are armed to the teeth because turkey made sure of that . 
  the entire nusra/arhar army might soon decide to hang in turkey ; then the pkk will look like some remote trouble . 
  remember how much interpol yelled at us for 5k potential hiding ex jihadis and how it was a headeach keeping tabs on every one of them ? 
  now imagine 50k currrent , heavily armed jihadis hanging around in southern turkey , and not trying to hide and keep a low profile but running their jihad shariah thingy in the open in southern turkey and ignoring turkish authority . 
  turkey will have to disarm them ( at least in turkish territory ) to keep control over them and the edge to their military, 
  i 'm curious , why have n't those guys been arrested and tried ? 
  and can they be deported ? 
  the last thing we need is salafists roaming around brainwashing kids like that . 
  we should n't protect actual known criminal individuals . 
  without exagerating , and staying calm for a minute , the bit about weapons floating in southern turkey & isis arming itself is truth . 
  turkey might have to start strong disarmament campaigns ( disarming jihadis ) in southern turkey to gain stability once the scw is over . 
  like by confiscating weapons without arresting people ( to encourage them to turn them over ) of offering cheap cash rewards to hand them to the military/police station & buying back blackmarket weapons floating around ; & independantly from all that arresting daesh recruiters because they 're about to turn on him . 
  i remember mexico having such programs to help reduce the number of mafia weapons in circulation, 
   yeah , by building a wall along the channel and making the french pay for it . 
   he should build a moat . 
  you might even fill it with sea water to save some time !, 
   they should n't build housing for illegal immigrants . 
  either you legalize people and give them a roof , or you have illegals and slum . 
   either you claim asylum that 's what we 're trying to get them to do , yes \u00b2  and detained yes glorious police state always solved everything  this approach seems dumb thank you / s  it will just encourage more economic migrants to go there the french system is in good shape on that side but thank you for your concerns . 
  and in that case it 's not france they want to go but the uk . 
  it 's more germany , sweden , denmark and greece and some east european ( hungary ? 
  ) / balkan countries that look in trouble . 
   why does france allow the place to exist in the first place ? 
  the shanty town is n't tolerated anymore , hence the eviction and bulldozing and pushing people in a bit better housing ( altho i 'm sure the gov could try something better there , like with running water and power in every units and more sanitaries and more housing space ; prefab is cheap . ), 
   if they are refugees they should claim asylum there . 
  that 's what we are telling them . 
  problem is , a lot are n't interested in living in france and would rather be trying to be illegals in the uk .

  not her , but some of the people around her definitely are `` former '' nazis .

  good point . 
  some countries talk about making their own tho depending on the result of the uk 's vote , whether to join or leave . 
   nah , the ep can basically change whatever it likes , they would get a new one ripped . 
   , or even block the whole thing , which would cause an instant brexit ... talk about political murder-suicide of carreer . 
  the whole point of that agreement is to fully respect it and define where are the lines not to cross for both bruxelles and the uk and how to make this whole eu thing work out ; not to give the ep excuses for political foodfights, 
  regarding the article assertion :  `` crucially , this deal is not legally binding and can be ripped up by eu politicians and unelected eu judges . '', 
  i 'm very surprized . 
  i fully expect it to be entirely binding on the eu in the conditions stated in should the uk votes to stays in . 
  only renegociation between both the uk and the eu could alter it , and the eu is not entitled to unilatterally `` ripping it off '' . 
  that would of course be outrageous if bruxelles were to ignore it after hard negociations . 
   well that was an anti-climax . 
  not really . 
  he announced earlier his demands and it was obvious some of it he would get and other would be negociated . 
  now the unsure parts is the rest of the conservatives ' reaction when cameron will try sell them the proposal ( good luck , mr cameron ) ; and obviously the referendum that look like a huge 50/50 for the moment so i suspect last minute decisions of voters on the fence will play a huge role ( at my own level i 'm happy that the agreement has been signed and mostly happy with the content too ; that 's still reasonable . 
  hopefully it 'll work ! ), 
  good news . 
   ebu tejma who was suspected of recruiting hundreds of europeans to join the jihad for isis . 
  and no you ca n't even claim racism : the guy was thrown out on his actions alone . 
  the law is the same for everyone , and that includes laws on hate speech . 
   ut pkk and ypg are . 
  both members of the `` kck '' . 
  akp , chp and mhp are all the same since they all voted more presidential powers to mr erdogan !, 
  all members of that same `` turkey '' umbrella organization, 
   what 's wrong with being the fringe ? 
  you do n't see an issue with a party ( the `` french national front '' ) that has a large population of nazis in it 's ranks ? 
  i 'm not advocating to ban them , they exist too and have a right to do so , but does n't mean i 'd like to see them in the presidential chair either . 
  imagine trump 's advisory circle was made of former kkk . 
  but , lots of people disagree and it seems elections will decide that . 
  turkish propaganda that put every kurds in the same bag and just look for excuses to destroy pyd/ypg rojava . 
  just look how they shell the completely unrelated afrin canton or maintain pressure in sur or cizr and do nothing about the actual tak operating in qandil or iran . 
   can the fn open its accounts in russian banks ? 
  interesting point . 
  i 'm not entirely sure on the wording of the law . 
  i guess it would be tolerated * as long as they hand over the bank statements like they do for french accounts * . 
  ( how much money there 's on it , where it goes , what comes in , the usual legal accounting ) edit : the fn does have currently at least several french accounts . 
  opening a new one in russia would complicate things in needless manner i think for them because then they would be bound both by french and russian law since it 'd be a russian bank . 
  what causes them trouble tho is not lack of an account in france but that they do n't have as much money as they like to run all the propaganda they want for the prez campaign ( and the whole point of the politics financing law is exactly to limit said propaganda ), 
  if the party takes a loan it 's not the bank funding them ; it 's the party that makes the move to go to the bank and ask for it . 
  then the bank can decide yes or no at their discretion ( there 's nothing obligating a bank to loan money to a political party ) . 
  individuals as a person can open an account ( and there are laws preventing banks to block deny it ) ; but there 's nothing saying bank have to accept opening an account for a political party tho . 
  and no individuals ca n't use a personnal account for a political party . 
  political parties have to be registered and the accounting is verified . 
   can the government really stop them from financing the fn ? 
  if a russian bank wants to give a loan to the fn , not really . 
  if a non banking company tries the fn and the fn accept it , the fn would be in trouble tho ( and the company that gave money risks getting sued to oblivion ) . 
  edit : most of the `` political '' money in france comes from grants and campaign refunding by the state ; and the % age of votes you get or deputies elected , etc , influentiate seriously the amounts of money you get ; that allows leveling the financial playfield . 
  edit2 : and as to why we `` ca n't '' stop the fn 's funding : historically , the biggest worry have been corporations getting `` their man '' in power with their money and using it to vandalizing the law code limitating them ( it happened multiple times in the past ) like by getting minimal wage laws repelled immediately in exchange for funding etc. 
  individuals in corporations can vote , but corporations ca n't vote `` more '' than the sum of their members `` just because we have money '' , that destroys the democraty ( and just result in them using their money to `` vote '' themselves into power and wire themselves all the gov money as `` subsidies '' and abolish themselves taxes and having to pay living wages ), 
  firms are more or less banned from making a real political donation because it 's open corruption ; only symbolic amounts are allowed ( and even then people look strangely at you if you do it ) . 
  if we catch a company giving any real money to politicians , they 're going to be in huge trouble . 
  we do n't want superpac-like legal bribery here ( if only because it leads to oligarchs deciding who get elected by allocating money and media coverage and that kills the democracy ) . 
   still , do n't get your point .
