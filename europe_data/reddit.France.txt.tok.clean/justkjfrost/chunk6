   but if you say that a woman should be raped or killed for wearing a bikini or not wanting to cover herself from head to toes , then it 's allright . 
  no it 's not . 
  without digging hard , incitation to violence in such conferences likely fits the `` hate speech '' clause , especially the 1881 law : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/discours_de_haine#france https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/lois_contre_le_racisme_et_les_discours_de_haine#france  provocation publique \u00e0 la discrimination , \u00e0 la haine ou \u00e0 la violence raciale . 
  / art . 
  24 alin\u00e9a 6 loi 1881 / emprisonnement de 1 an au plus et/ou amende de 45 000 $ au plus public incitation to discrimination , hate and violence , racial [ or not ] . 
  / art 24 blah blah / 1 year jail and/or 45k $ fine . 
   provocation publique \u00e0 la discrimination , \u00e0 la haine ou \u00e0 la violence nationale , raciale ou religieuse / loi 1881 : art . 
  8 / emprisonnement de 1 an au plus , amende de 45 000 $ / privation de droits civiques pendant 5 ans au plus ( cp : art.131-26 2 \u00b0 et 3 \u00b0 15 ) , affichage ou diffusion de la d\u00e9cision prononc\u00e9e ( cp : 131-3516 ) public incitation to discrimination , hate or national violence , racial or religious / law 1881 ... / jail 1 year , 45k $ fine . 
  / deprivation of civil rights for 5y or more . 
  public display of the sentance [ in newspappers ] . 
  ( ... ) and since those gentlemens seem quite loaded , in some cases it might even applies for some of their side preachings :  provocation \u00e0 des actes de terrorisme ou apologie publique de ces actes / code p\u00e9nal : art . 
  421-2-526 / emprisonnement de 5 \u00e0 7 ans , amende de 75 000 $ \u00e0 100 000 $ iciting terrorism or public apologetism of such acts . 
  ( ... ) 5 to 7y in jail ; fins of 75k to 100k . 
  and for those that might actually cross the second line and enact upon said violence and attack their wife , there 's a special law just for them ; with quite the number of possibilities and jail sentances : http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=jorftext000022454032&amp;categorielien=id, 
   with the participation of clerics like nader abou anas who preaches conjugal rape in bobigny i believe that 's highly illegal . 
  maybe we should i dunno , arrest and/or deport them depending on their legal statut ? 
  could you please keep the violence in turkey/kurdistan ? 
  i know you hate each other but we do n't need fights in europe thank you . 
   same in the us , same in many other countries to protect minorities with extra care , as being racist is a different level and it is not tolerated . 
  sorry for my lack of clarity , i 100 % support this . 
  what i meant is that if there was overkill in the judgement you might want to look at hungarian level rather than eu level . 
  since it 's not an extra dramatic case or a big scandal , the eu wo n't bother give an extra crap either . 
  they have bigger issues right now to take care of than just an isolated idiot kicking people . 
   this is not even so special , e.g. 
  simply denying holocaust can result imprisonmet eu wide , and only in the eu in europe wide ( the geographical peninsula ) , not ( just ) eu . 
  even in goddam russia or china you might not want to do that everywhere . 
  this is a cultural thing tho . 
  we all paid in blood for the second world war , so yes it leaves a lot of consequences on society . 
  uh i do n't think there ever was eu legislation on tripping people ( or even `` assault & battery '' ) . 
  this would be way overkill since the eu legislative/executive power is only used for structural & largescale issues ( e.g : spending policies or immigration questions ) . 
  this is most likely an hungarian law . 
  lots of countries have similar laws but passed them themselves . 
  as surprising as this could be , looking at past hungarian actions , i 'm forced to agree . 
  they showed quite decent restraint even when facing trouble . 
  their police is doing a very good job on that one ( from what we could see at least , true , but still ) . 
  the plane ticket on existing low costs lines in empty seats is probably a lot cheaper is properly negociated tbh . 
  those planes will fly either way soo ... 
  this . 
  very much needed . 
  that 's probably why we should restart border control and decide who we allows to come in then ( syrians ok , pakistanis not ok it 's safe there ; plane ticket home . ), 
   paying 10-20 % tax on something , even if spread over two years , no property owner is going to like . 
  if the value triple with their extreme market speculation ( +200 % ) , they 'll pay the 10 % and keep doing exactly the same thing the fine was supposed to discourage them from doing . 
   10-20 % ** tax ** here 's the core of the issue . 
  it 's supposed to be a fine . 
  a slap in the face telling you `` do n't do it again '' because those actions poison the system for everyone else that is n't you . 
  not a tax ( small participation back to society ) . 
  only 60k ? 
  that 's not going to make them change policy when some properties easily are worth 5-10x that and will gain even more from their hedgefund-like speculation : /, 
  the # 1 troublemaker in syria right now is daesh and the usa are busy bombing them , with help from a lot of countries . 
  all right , that would work on the condition the imams are locals/locally trained . 
  ( ie germans in charge . 
  we do n't need more wahabism . 
   i like how that argument pops up all the time these days maybe because there 's a grain of truth in it ? 
   like it 's some kind of big discovery yeah , politicians discovered they could use the thing between their 2 ears i guess . 
   i do n't know how right wing politicians can say this shit with a straight face when they 're the same ones who will try to cut foreign aid budgets to a minimum at all turns . 
  probably because it costs them less than welfare , which means they can steal more money , i guess . 
   then svalbard ? 
  they might find it a bit cold haha, 
  haha , it 's like they 're not even trying . 
  tho it 's annoying because the guy does have half a valid point ( something something broken clocks right twice a day ) :  why should we bear the consequences when 90 % of them want to go to four european countries ? 
  and those countries in their museums have both dinosaurs and mammoths that were n't dug out in their own lands . 
  no , they stole all of that , they liked it and they killed for it . 
  now the people are going back after their stolen fortunes . 
  they 're not going there for a free meal from the red cross . 
  they want jobs , they want to find their relatives already living there , they want to speak the languages of the nations that occupied them for centuries . 
  it 'd be easier to fix their origin country to reduce the migrant flows . 
   fsa has also committed tortures , executions and other war crimes . 
  they are different from isis only on the scale of these atrocities in the fsa 's case it 's not a policy , it 's mainly isolated incidents that tend to crop up regularly because the snc & other high level officials have little direct day to day control over their own militias ( unlike others ) . 
  in daesh case , it 's a policy to murder-torture-massacre everybody that do n't immediately bend knee to them . 
   are then former isis members also ok if they say they are `` former '' no . 
  most of the fsa 's there to fight off assad . 
  however people join daesh knowing explicitely that daesh 's mission on earth is to commit regular mini genocides . 
  i mean , they butchered to death at least 4000 people in camp speicher over 24h ( and i heard they are still discovering new deads from time to time ) . 
  enslaved tens of thousands of yazidis . 
  run a slave market in mosul & raqqah . 
  really actually crucified kids ( no , really . 
  burnt alive dozens upon dozens of people , and that 's not even the most painfull they figured out . 
  hell , they tape it themselves and proudly show it to the world themselves . 
  you ca n't pretend to join daesh in good faith . 
  talking about that , i 'm still kind of concerned that some chechens ( i know it 's a minority , like 1-5 % , but still ) fighters fought alongside isis troops in syria/iraq and now fight in eastern ukraine . 
  yes i heard the `` we 're totally not isis and in fact dislike they 're ideology and that 's why we ran away '' but i hope the sbu will keep an eye on them long term because i 'm a bit concerned about whether some intend to settle down or what are their plan after the war . 
  how do you make one kind of combatants ok to get inside europe and another one - former combatant , as far as i know . 
  well , his unimpeded entry is anoying i will admit , but we ca n't really arrest people that had been calm for quite some time & do n't apparently plot anything ( even if he should indeed stay under surveillance ) . 
  ( well we can but better not stir up the pot again for nothing ... )  where is the line ? 
  very good question , and the ideas diverge there . 
  i 'd probably draw the line at joigning terrorists groups ( isis , nusra ) & known or suspected of doing war crimes ( e.g : idiots that post pics or like it online and document their abuse like daesh . 
  systematic prosecution needed there ) , or potential risks for national security i 'd guess ( have them have a chat with security when they come ofc ) . 
  with arrest or refusal of entry depending on the case . 
  and systematic surveillance of anyone linked to that mess and/or that went in syria . 
   how do you know for sure he is only a coward and not connected to isis ? 
  fsa & daesh are at war with each others . 
  edit : you can downvote me if you want but it 's true ; they 're killing each other around aleppo currently . 
  good . 
  they are n't the police and certainly not entitled to force any archaic religious law on us . 
   this week they resend them to the island and have them on standby so that they can restore order in case of bigger riots as tensions are high . 
  good idea, 
  you might want riot police reinforcements on the island tho, 
   how would you even go about searching for european webshops ? 
  www.amazon.co.uk ( or whatever variant for the country you are in ) ? 
  ebay 's also a good bet .
