  problem is most people yell `` all the foreigners out ! '', 
  then push anyone of brown skin or with a funny name on the limits of society , which perpetuate the problem . 
  i 'd suggest starting with actual convicted criminals first ; and secondly trying to reduce that number of criminal by addressing social issues as best as possible  2 ) once a man 's mind is that far as of a terrorist , there is no practically other solution but complete and total isolation , sadly , i 'd say there is that dangerous and lengthy `` salafist '' intermediate statut . 
  basically the one where they do n't drop bombs , but where they start yelling at people for eating pork or shaving their beard , remove their kids from normal schools , watch jihadi videos and try clothing their wives/daughters like medieval ninja . 
  it 's at that point they should be caught , not once they connected to islamists in syria . 
   maybe , just maybe , you could turn around 0.01 % of those with education and bla-bla , but it is not worthy . 
  i dunno , i 'd be happy if we reached similar numbers than with alcoolism detox, 
   show me another option that would work . 
  1 \u00b0 ) ending their parrallele society by integrating them in the actual local country ( and not just geographical ) . 
  language courses , putting their kids in the same school than the englishs ones , ending their parrallele tribal `` justice '' system , cops paid risk bonuses to patrol those areas , etc. 
  2 \u00b0 ) working on a serious deradicalization system to handle them . 
  if only as a tool when appropriate for justice & police & social services . 
  there are cases where they can legally arrest you or take your kids , or put you in detox . 
  so there should be cases where they send you to deradicalization . 
  3 \u00b0 ) working with community leaders to help integrate them and better figure out/sort problems that tend to keep them apart of the rest of us 4 \u00b0 ) no tolerance for violence or harassment , assault , anything similar . 
  especially for illegals (  deportation ) you beat somebody , you harass a girl or act as an highwayman in a gang ? 
  prison then eviction . 
  5 \u00b0 ) getting countries to take back their illegal citizens in europe that we do n't want ( esp criminals that purged their sentance ) . 
  if they do n't play ball the eu cut all helps and visa from their country . 
  6 \u00b0 ) dealing with that goddam youth poverty problem that is dismantling apart our society . 
  seriously , that `` you 're a kid you do n't need money '' & `` let 's cut all the welfare/unemployment to the lazy freeloaders '' , systematic neoliberal ( neolibertarian ? ), 
  dismantlement of the social net & unpaid internship & `` lowering minimal wage for the job creators '' bullshit need to end because it 's killing our society . 
  somebody that has to pay rent/food but has no income will sooner or later inevitably turn to crime . 
  7 \u00b0 ) arresting , and trying the daesh & islamists recruiters for abusing people 's position of weakness ( it 's illegal in french law , i suspect something like it should exist in uk law ? ), 
  & kicking them out . 
  dismantling the radical networks . 
   the thing is : can we - as human race - do any better than `` extreme disenfranchisment '' ? 
  we should strive for . 
  leaving people in the gutter then wondering why they go bonkers and break a lot of things then saying `` such is life '' and pushing their family on the same road is n't right . 
   worked for peoples from different religions and cultures ? 
  hence integration and making people who come in our countries adopt our culture might be a better answer than trying to put them on the margins of society and ignoring the problem till they blew up themselves or someone else . 
   either by distance and fences or by putting eternity between them and us . 
  \\* shakes head \\* it 's what led them to become this and made radicals so influentials . 
  i was talking about how french justice would handle it . 
  edit : my phrasing might be terrible in the precedent post i realise . 
  when i wrote `` you '' i meant in a general manner , not `` you '' to designate the englishmen . 
  `` when you catch somebody doing this you might give him such sentance ''  `` when somebody get caught doing this he 'll risk that '', 
   murderers should n't ever see the sky again without being in chains . 
  oh so you would also have a category of people you 'd sentance to hanging or beheading going by that logic ? 
  why do people are always so happy with ending the life of other people they know nothing about and pretend knowing justice 's job better than people who studied years for it . 
  5-10y for that ? 
  are n't you a bit jail happy with other people 's life ? 
  that 's what you give murderers . 
  not drunk noborder anar kids . 
  if i were asked i 'd go mainly for suspended time as a `` do n't do it again '' ( sursis , ie they do n't serve it unless facing justice again in a short time ), 
  right wingers ' rants nonthwistanding ; i do n't think that #noborders qualifies for sentances you give to murderers or other actual criminals . 
  but i guess the justice want to charge them with trespassing and outrage to police or something like that edit  fuck la france ( tag in calais ) http://i.imgur.com/rhdqr.jpg :d, 
  because , clearly coffee & cigarettes qualify as `` luxury '' and `` overspending '' . 
  just try taking those away to see the reaction / s say mr prime minister , how much is your wristwatch worth already . 
  50 000 euro ? 
  more ? 
   relevance ? 
  for the record , i 'd never vote for either of them . 
  exactly . 
  neither was that `` question '' relevant . 
   if you have a group of people in lille demanding to be allowed on the train to paris without a ticket , it 's not a problem for paris ... 
  except that the english industrialist actually sent a large numbers of them in europe to attract them to the continent . 
  why ? 
  because when england gave it 's independance to india because it was inevitable in the end , they lost access to basically unlimited unpaid manpower . 
  so your big industry corporate world basically realized 10 years latter that in the real european world they were legally obliged to pay english workers , despite tatcher 's best efforts to destroy any and all unions even using military force . 
  and paying people = less money for the corporatists . 
  so they decided to being back their old employees from the former colonies , that would do the same for borderline no wage without complaining . 
  but hey , as usual , when in doubt blame the french . 
  pfff  what ? 
  you 're comparing 1.2 million through legal means over ~ 50 years to roughly ~ 15,000 per year ( your `` 50 '' number is nonsense ) crossing the channel illegally ? 
  no , they did n't passed by france . 
  the torries gave visas to everyone , then they blame all their social problems on the barely noticable problems in calais . 
  then they blew out the problem totally out of proportion to ensure we frenchs would take the blame for the problems caused by the 2m pakistanis they imported as under the table 1 # / h workers . 
  ( that 's why btw cameron is pushing for a legislation where they have to earn 30k/y or face deportation )  they 're not the largest group of foreign-born people in the uk ( they 're third , after indians and polish ) , nor are they any more likely to be `` poorly integrated '' than any other muslim indians are the biggest group brought in and most of them moved in pakistan during the pak/india trouble , before getting imported to the uk , but on indian visa for their part . 
  i guess you could start seeing a pattern there ? 
   nor are they any more likely to be `` poorly integrated '' than any other . 
  well , guess who started those shariah courts in england ? 
  indians & pakistanis , yep . 
   for comparison , france has an ( estimated ) 6 million citizens of north african ethnicity . 
  buuut once again , blame france . 
  easier and free to do french bashing in the press rather than drop their cheap & exploited manpower i guess . 
  edit : for the sake of clarification , the english gov could actually do something like crackdown on `` shariah courts , '' work on integration , enforce minimal wages & rise it or add employer-side taxes on hiring non eu foreigners ( to discourage bringing foreigners for cheaper ) , free english lessons , random controls against illegal work , welfare to prevent people being abused by a single employer , etc etc , but nooo . 
  since the gov is halfway in the oligarchs ' pocket and they call the shots , they decided to blame every single problem on their nearest neighbor ( namely evil invaders from ~ ~ nato ~ ~ france ) & started a giant propaganda campaign against us instead , because * obviously * ( / s ) everything can be traced back to a handfull of people managing to cross near calais . 
  this kind of strategy is so going to pay long term / s, 
   is the housing that you 're building nearby ? 
  yes . 
  or i could say that anyone living on the side of the manche channel is simply looking at invading france . 
  see how i can make shit up too ? 
   how is this different from the half-dozen or so other `` clearouts '' that have been done over the years ? 
  how are you any different that the average ~ ~ donald trump ~ ~ farage voter ? 
  i too can write made up rethorical questions . 
   why is several thousand undocumented migrants camping in northern france the uk 's responsibility ? 
  it is n't . 
  neither they are ours . 
  they do n't want to be in france . 
  okay if you want to play the game of `` not yet there not my problem '' , how about we start giving them all french passeports and a free eurotunnel ticket paid by the french state and let them go wherever they want then ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  how many of the people camped in calais are from pakistan ? 
  i 'm saying you are an hypocrite and a scoundrel . 
  your country invited 1.2 million pakistanis in england over the last few years ; and they are causing giant social problem . 
  but 50-100 migrants a year that manage to cross illegally past 5000 cops that nobody notices in your society , and you 're on the verge of declaring us open war and yelling on all medias how `` france is helping dirty foreigners stealing all the english welfare hide yo kids hide yo wife it 's all the frenchs ' fault '' . 
   around 11,000 pakistanis were admitted into the uk ( most on short-term visas ) , uh . 
  lulz . 
  lulz . 
  you gave about 1-2 million visas : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_pakistanis and i 'm not counting all the obvious overstayed tourist visas ( i 'd bet there 's an additionnal 1/3 of undeclared pakis ) .
