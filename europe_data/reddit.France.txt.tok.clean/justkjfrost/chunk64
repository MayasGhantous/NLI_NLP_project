  just to let you know , companies never create more jobs just because the state agree they are above taxes . 
  they just add the whole thing in their accounts or give it to the shareholders & executives as bonuses , because that 's what companies where created for : make investors & execs richer . 
  not `` creating jobs '' . 
  that 's , on the other hand , what they tell you when they do n't want to pay taxes . 
  so , if those who actually have large amounts of money in the society ( corporations ) never pay taxes , who do ? 
  and what happen when the state has no reliable tax income ? 
  and what happen when all the money is siphoned away to fiscal paradises and not reinjected in our society ? 
  are they a benefit to society if the state could instead simply use that money to `` create jobs '' directly without the corporation to add their margin in and send that money away to the bermudas ? 
  people who believe companies are `` job creators '' are the same who believe companies when they tell everyone that `` unpaid internships '' ( unpaid employees ) are normal instead of employees and `` create jobs '' and `` they 'll get paid later '' . 
  yeah , right . 
  edit : ( since i 'm banned i can only edit retrocactively old posts to answer sorry )  it 's not particularly applicable in other cases . 
  yes , yes it is . 
  and even when they create some jobs , it wo n't be economically interesting because once you factor in their margins and the other inevitable tax `` evasion '' habits that comes with the kind of people that negociate tax break & the inevitable additionnal subsidies & the corruption they tend to forster by generally backing those demands with bribes , it 's a net loss . 
  the state would make more money by refusing : - they recover a bit on taxes when the megacorp will inevitably try to come in anyway - that company is n't a weigh on society in the mean time ( hey who alsphat the roads leading to their buildings , build the phoneline & powerline to their headquarters & trained their futur employees on tax money ? 
  yep , the state & society . ), 
  - they save all the money on subsidies - the money do n't leave as much the country on corporate `` evasion '' accounts abroad - the company do n't `` contribute '' to the problem of trying to lower wage constantly everywhere in the area & recruiting unpaid internships as an ersatz for paid employees , because that 's what megacorps do nowadays - the company do n't contribute to the problem too by bribing ~ ~ luxembourg ~ ~ belgium politicians into abolishing tax for them & ~ ~ helping them steal tax money ~ ~ giving them state money as `` subsidies '' . 
  well we kindah proposed to seriously lessen them ( or even cancel a lot ) in exchange for releasing the remaining hostages ( like sentsov or savtchenko , kolchenko , dzhemilev 's son , chyrniy , afanasyev ... ) . 
  nothing that would endanger or damage russia . 
  but the russians refused and prefer doing kangaroo trials & enduring sanctions . 
  merah was radicalized in jail . 
  then he hided his travels to some places like ` stan . 
  jordan was n't off limit for it 's part ( due to being touristic ) . 
  most of the stuff on his file was noticed retroactively once they were looking for him, 
  as far as i know we are jailing people coming back from jihad as of late ? 
  ( some are hidding tho obviously but if caught they are going to get arrested )  if you want names just check the 2 assholes who committed charlie hebdo attacks they were hidding the whole time . 
  unless you are saying that the usa `` tolerate '' al qaeda because some are hidding in continental us ? 
  edit : my memory could be wrong , checking edit : the kouachi brothers never managed to reach syria apparently ? 
  one of them got arrested before . 
  they radicalized locally, 
  the second somebody do something like that he forfeits any right to asylum . 
   we let them walk freely on the street . 
  oh , like who ? 
  what are they waiting for to arrest & deport them ? 
  ( and put quick reference flyers in any asylum center that doing anything like that will result in jail/deportation ), 
  ah yes , '' job creators '', 
  they 're not even hiding it . 
  shit it 's like they 're proud of the gov helping fraud . 
  it 's something out of former eastern europe, 
   do you want to force a free people into your little scheme in a matter of eu internal politics ? 
  who said anything about forcing greenland ? 
  here 's my questions about how they would react and what could possibly interest them in exchange or otherwise looking at some of the french islands , aka dom/toms . 
   why do n't you retake algeria instead and implement this fantasy there ? 
  because : - they already declined - they do n't have much empty space with pre established infra - nobody talked about invading anyone by force ? 
  alright , sorry for using that topic as a plateform , but looking at the situation the war takes too long to resolve in syria . 
  we 'll need a stopgap measure between waiting for the end , and getting flooded with more than we can handle . 
  the australian solution has it 's merits ( sending people in an offshore center out of the main country ) . 
  if things are n't moving with turkey , we might want to look at that greenland facility and give it a good second look : http://www.thelocal.dk/20150917/danish-peoples-party-send-refugees-to-greenland - how would greenland & danemark react to such a proposition ? 
  - can the facility be expanded & supplied easily ? 
  - how long would it take to open the place ? 
  can we do it in weeks ? 
  - how long would it take to inform smuggler networks ( & intended targets ) that getting to europe will only land them there ? 
  - not a question , but we could start by informing people that anyone caught in europe without proper papers ( passeport or id or similar , asylum claim filled ) but already there will be deported there systematically . 
  it 'd motivate a large number not to throw away their papers . 
  second , we can start by moving there a large number of people simply by doing random control of people standing around & identifying those . 
  and any problem-causer like refugees already caught & sentanced that we 'd want to deport anyway . 
  third , it 'd discourage people thinking they can simply get in germany , if a lot of them end up in greenland . 
  if greenland is unavailable it 'd be also interesting to study with the french gov whether a remote dom/tom could be used in replacement . 
  on the whole picture that seems fair to me : - real refugees and people fleeing terrible situation gets a second chance - but it reduce the strain on europe - greenland or some other remote place would discourage a lot of people - it 'd help reducing the number of unregistered unknown illegals - no direct access to the continent for new immigrants & undeclared/illegals : they get sent to greenland ( or wherever ) instead, 
   islamists . 
  there are videos of imams calling for assualts on kuffar women to humble them . 
  yeah flag them for asylum refusal & deportation too , and even hate speech when appropriate . 
  especially the salafists radicals  to prevent it from happening again you either lower the amount of islamists in your society or bring the force of the state against them how about a good bit of both, 
  you do understand they ca n't exactly claim everything out loud due to the military conflict with russia in eastern ukraine , right ? 
   hmm , i can bet with you that your penal code gives few years of prison time for people who left your country during war ditching military service . 
  does it mean that french people are `` arrogant ass speaking '' ? 
  erh i might be arrogant , that much is true : x. tho , regarding the military service it was de facto suspended in france ( well , ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ [ 1 day ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/journ%c3%a9e_d%c3%a9fense_et_citoyennet%c3%a9 ) ~ ~ s ~ ~ long . 
  ) , we rely mostly on ~ ~ nato firepower ~ ~ a professionnal/volunteer military . 
  and if i had a say on it i 'd not bother much with deserts as long as they do n't stand in the way ( ie go civilian away ) & there 's enough troops to run policy . 
   you claim that syria is lost ? 
  yes and no . 
  i simply suspect the syrian gov needs to make an agreement with other factions to drop some lest , reform it 's most brutal institution and then there 'll be a more reasonable united front to fight with for most syrians . 
  but at that state of the war , it 's like when poland was cut in two between the nazis & the soviets , anyone fighting isolated would be overrun in no time & killed . 
  there need to be a bit of condition change before poland ( syria ) can make a comeback as a country . 
   can i ask for your military experience ? 
  mostly an interested party that follow that mess : /  eu could easily form an army out of those syrians that 's kindah what we try with the sdf in the north , and what we try by bringing the less crazy other factions in the conference room in geneva . 
   i am for giving them an option leave or stay and get trained for battle rather than rape german women . 
  the rapists needs to be arrested , jailed for a long time then deported straight . 
  the question is what to do with the other 99 % . 
   eu wanted to create common military , lets check it in practise . 
  well , they 're studying a 10 years plan for that so there 's nothing really ready now . 
   as far as i know , le pen and her party has nothing to do with them , the fn use the identitaires as a proxy they `` have nothing to do with '' that `` find their swatiska tattoos and flags somewhere else '' like the russians fighting in eastern ukraine where `` totally local miners and truck drivers ukrainians '' that incidently stumbled upon t-90 's in a surplus shop . 
  ( and the point of that comparison is not to say the russians are nazi . 
  they are not . 
  the point is : maskirovska ), 
  ... you do understand we ( western countries , eu , usa , various allies , ... ) funnelled a relatively large amount of ressources ( ... ) in ukraine to help them stand in front of the russian invasion & not crash , to prevent half their country running in poland & romania ( & russia ) , right ? 
   but you are complaining that the riot police is doing their job of controlling a violent protest instead of investigating a crime ( which is n't their job ) . 
  nah i meant the riot police had the manpower to handle the riot it 's normal , but that manpower was nowhere to be found when it was time to handle the rioters hiding in the refugees 2 weeks ago so there 's an issue somewhere . 
  ~ ~ altho i have sneaky suspicions volunteers are present in larger numbers when it 's time to hit pegida `` right wingers '' in the face , wonder why  .  . ~ ~, 
   i believe westerners have general attitude to use negative descriptions and ad personam arguments during conversation . 
  i know that if you claim something `` populist '' or someone `` racist '' or `` asshole '' it doesnt require further explanation , but mind that i am no westerner . 
  if a pole say `` just throw the refugees in syria with a gun '' , yes i will say he 's an arrogant ass speaking from his personnal cushy life and sending extremely large amounts of people to their death . 
  you do n't `` just send people to fight for their country '' just like you do n't just `` send people to fight for poland '' in wwii . 
  so who do you pick ? 
   i believe this idea could have been a prelude to a discussion . 
  i agree a discussion is important . 
   precisely why do europe allow battle capable men on their territory , because the entire syrian clusterhell is going down under and there 's not much left for them to fight for for the moment , before at least the main factions agree to settle a bit . 
  and yes , there 's going to be a geneva iii for that soon . 
  another attempt . 
   i would remember people fighting for this country for example . 
  `` country '' ?
