  meanwhile , your pensioners that squat my beachs by the busload certainly do n't . 
  so can we stop the self centric racist comments for a minute ? 
  ah yes . 
  of course , the entire planet exist just to conspire to go in the uk to steal your very own money . 
  paranoia much ? 
   pressure on housing ( we have a shortage ) , pressure on schools , more competition for work , more pressure on the nhs . 
  you understand it was like always like that since wwii ? 
  have you seen how bad people had it when tatcher was busy dismantling unions and destroying coal miner towns ? 
  blaming the `` pawel or ivan '' is not exactly going to do wonder to fix the real issues affecting your system like the city 's financial system controling everything and constantly leeching money out of everything in the uk . 
   it 's not `` xenophobia '' i 'm not even indigenous english it 's simply too much , and no my tax should not fund foreigners if i wanted to contribute to pawel or ivan 's lifestyle i would have moved to eastern europe not the uk . 
  okay . 
  what would have happen if the us said the same to the uk instead of extending the marshall plan ? 
  `` i do n't want to use our tax money to fund the lifestyle of james , william and smith when i could just use it on me . '', 
  please , tell me . 
   i 'm not even indigenous english now the irony seems quite lost on you  you can have your eu without us . 
  seems more and more it 's headed that way , true, 
  poor and terrible place ? 
  it would n't be entirely out of place in the city : http://ua-travelling.com/uploads/gallery/photos/img/photo_cities_of_ukraine/kharkov_photos/kharkov_at_night/kharkiv_at_night._water_plays_with_light.jpg http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6314/137247253.f/0_9658d_a01b8aa8_xxl http://photographers.ua/thumbnails/pictures/15527/800xdsc_5070-1-w.jpg some citizens are poor and corruption is rampant , but oh well better not scratch in financial london \\* points the banksters \\* for the last one either / s, 
  neither that mean you need to invent fictive burden to justify constant xenophobia . 
  or constantly looking for excuses to step out of your turn to pay back eu contributions `` because i do n't want my tax money to fund dirty foreigners when i could just pocket it like we pocketed 20 years of eu budget before '' . 
   go to london and see what 's happened in certain districts - it 's too much to fast . 
  ~ ~ nah i do n't need to go that far , i can just go in / r/european if i need to . ~ ~ little kharkhiv ? 
  did you ever visited the town to qualify it that like that really ? 
  it probably in better shape and better looking than some english cities tbh . 
   with other fully developed countries like france and the netherlands and germany and denmark not these post soviet poverty cases . 
  you understand that we were post wwii poverty cases too 20 years earlier ? 
  hell , even london largely suffered the blitz . 
  get down from your `` rich and develloped superior country '' pedestal would you . 
  no you 're not `` that better above '' eastern europe . 
  and inventing a large gulf only serves to reinforce the idea some of the uk 's citizens are also a bit delusionnal too but the other way . 
  damn . 
  that 's one bleak vision of the eu you have . 
  only dirty foreigners out to steal uk 's rightful money and impoverish you . 
   _   and turn entire neighbourhoods into `` little kharkiv '' i knew the `` all invading foreigners '' propaganda was getting a bit off hand but you take it to next levels . 
  do frenchs also build `` little paris '' and spaniards `` little madrid '' in the uk too ? 
  good . 
  scientology is a scam that use ligitation and blackmail as it 's main tools to keep pumping money away from people . 
  toss 'em the book !, 
  i believe arbitrary long term solitary confinement tends to drive people crazy ( ier ) over time and has been declared illegal . 
  and , yes i know most people here do n't give a shit about prisonners ' human rights , but it 's too easy , not going that way at my own level sorry . 
  how about a separate wing for all the religious nutcases . 
  it 's probably worth like a few euros here in france on public costs ( the real ones are likely the machinery to lay it , the steamroll or the maintenance crew wages ) and even then ... oo are all politicians drunk on sotchi highway prices or something ? 
  probably to put out burned cigarettes rolled out of 500 $ bills . 
   that just looks like poor plumbing . 
  ... out of a junkyard ... 
   a square-meter of asphalt usually costs 790km ( ~ 395 $ ) in bosnia and herzegovina . 
  is it made out of diamond powder or some other unobtainium ? 
   a regular trashcan for the republika srpska government cost the citizen 1.733,76 km ( ~ 866 $ ) . 
  i remember some redditor commenting their govs in the balkans were kind of a dumpster on fire , but this is next level  a regular ashtray for the republika srpska government cost the citizen 1.293,51 km ( ~ 646 $ ) ~ ~ i knew all that time spent looting junk in fo4 was gon na pay one day ~ ~ joke apart , ever though of opening some sort of corruption museum ? 
   german rap group aggro berlin were punished for some of their lyrics . 
  they have some really messed up , goory and misogenistic lyrics yeah but if you start punishing every edgy would-be-teens that yell `` fuck the police '' you might as well turn the country into north korea ...  and chose to believe i was interested in the latest furniture fads ... 
  i 'm not sure i want to know the story behind that one haha, 
  right now , that guy has as much chances of being elected than nigel farage 's right hand making 60 % + at the first round or zhirinovsky to get elected president in russia . 
  he 's an unknown nobody , and the fn is currently bound to marine le pen 's whim no matter what . 
  even fake-socialist valls has more hope of getting elected . 
  the telegraph is probably wasting their time there . 
   [ rapper saying ] `` fuck france , fuck the national anthem , fuck marianne , i wipe my ass with that sickening french flag ... '' truly , 2edgy4me  the case was thrown out . 
  that was likely the good choice when facing ~ ~ autism ~ ~ free speech ( even if it denotes mental retardation by it 's author ) ( i mean otherwise we 'd have had to jail french humorist desproges for some of his `` fuck the police and state all the way '' anti-state one man shows too ... ), 
  on mobile so not now but : http://i.imgur.com/kdj7zer.png, 
  that story is terrible . 
  i hope they will face the full force of the law and stay in jail for a very long time . 
  nice work . 
  one less free to plot killing people, 
   i have this theory , that eventually , if leftists do n't stop calling everyone who opposes them nazis , http://reflexes.samizdat.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/grosse-ambiance.jpg http://info.arte.tv/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/000_par7585365.jpg i will not , good sir , hide what i say and `` shut up '' . 
   where everyone who opposes the far left is a nazi , i never said that nor cried it . 
  i 'm saying the front national party , specifically , is the french nsdap . 
  there is a lot of opposition that is n't them and a lot less extreme . 
  maybe , and it 's not a nice thing to say , but it does n't take a phd to understand that despite our efforts african countries will stay massively exploited for decades , full of warzones and one of the largest areas on earth where starvation , violent combat or terrorism deaths and dying from easily treatable sicknesses is still extremely common . 
  they were in trouble , are in trouble , will be in trouble . 
  hell , we can barely hold up car together , so who ` se going to fix a mess as large as dr congo for example ? 
  think the syrian civilian war that has been going on for 20 years in africa and you 'll start to get it . 
  edit : just to be clear , i think we should certainly cooperate and help , but that does n't mean i expect a miracle by any means, 
  africa is fucked either way , nothing new . 
  was there any hope for them it 'd become something less screwed ? 
  west asia ? 
  if you talk about japan/continental china/taiwan china/singapore/south korea & co , they 'll be fine they can afford greenhouse food too . 
  and the rest will keep buying our price-dumped surplus as usual and still have an economy just as screwed as nowaday / statut-quo-is-god, 
   that 's a much smaller problem then increased droughts , different rain seasons , etc http://i.imgur.com/ndlfhpt.jpg?1 droughts ? 
  you can always green house food nowadays . 
  the spanishs already do it for a lot of things because their country is very dry nowadays . 
  wow this is like racism bingo . 
  i 'm saving that link , thanks, 
   that sounds like baseless fearmongering again , here are some of their `` identitaires '' buddies they fund under the table while loudly denying : http://reflexes.samizdat.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/grosse-ambiance.jpg http://info.arte.tv/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/000_par7585365.jpg you tell us they do n't remind you of a certain right wing group wearing black and swatiskas . 
  but noooo , surely this is an exageration , like with donald trump ; no nazis in the french fn obviously they must have found their nazi flags in a tourist/surplus shop / s edit : i mean , there 's the whole `` no it ca n't be that bad '' , and then there is the denial of reality guys . 
  oh sweet another akp bot . 
  tell me , what 's the average paycheck at the dailysabah ? 
   climate change refugees are going to overwhelm us erh in theory europe 's one of the continents that will loose a lot of ground if the sea keep rising . 
  not the other way around . 
  so if anything , it 's a lot of europeans that will have to relocate some place else . 
  unless we can put a stop to it by making co2/toxic/greenhouse emissions more manageable by example by starting to replace gasoline/diesel cars with better electric ones . 
   will probably get more without any promises or real results other than `` their word '' . 
  i 'm sure refugee camps sizes and estimations and people smuggling can easily be gauged from above if anything else to check whether they are in the same order of magnitude to what is announced, 
  well i 'm sure the turkish airforce not [ constantly making new airstrikes in northern iraq sometime dozens of time a day ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/turkey-air-strikes-against-pkk-iraq-army-143153457.html ) would be a good start . 
  erdogan made at some point more air sorties against the kurds than the coalition against daesh . 
  so it might explain why the pkk is a bit angry . 
   the real numbers usually come out years , if not decades later when there are n't revisionists doing their job : /, 
  physicaly attacking the head of the gov in the rada while half the parliement is full of fighters or ex fighters ? 
  what was he thinking ? 
  fully agreed, 
  not at the expense of everyone else .
