   and you continue to fight against isis . 
  we are kindah short of an occidental-level army willing to go all in for that . 
   but of course , peace keeping sounds way nicer than this variant . 
  peace keeping sounds like `` international large military loaned forces because your own country wo n't provide it alone ''  and non-violent . 
  well , if it stops the whole thing , it 'll lessen the violence . 
  well , maybe cold logic would suggest a peace keeping mission in lybia and likely syria to reduce the massacre then . 
  well good luck if they can actually do it  would n't bet on it with their current situation tho . 
  true , but those are more justified coming in than people who are already safe and just thinking they 'll get extra money coming here ( spoilers : they do n't :\\ \\ ), 
  bbc might want to put up an errata on that one : x, 
  haha . 
  damn . 
  not quite the same thing haha, 
  well , here 's a good start to crack down on human smuggling networks : x, 
   the fact that they can stay in europe should be enough for them . 
  the obvious problem here is we have two categories of people : - ( real ) refugees - people who are safe but think money rain from the sky in the eu and that everyone has a private yatch there ; so of course they want to come in . 
  and when they come in they see they get just like home , think we are hiding the yatch and ask for it . 
  better information ( which is incredibly easy to do and dirt cheap ) would probably at least stop most of the second category from loosing all their money and time coming for nothing while they already have similar living conditions currently . 
  i think it 's / u/karaps you want to ask , not me \\ ^ \\ ^, 
   they have facebook pages advertising safe passage to europe with pictures of luxurious yachts and they make sumptuous promises about life when they reach germany or sweden . 
  well there 's a problem, 
  maybe we should have an information campaign ( online & leaflets ? ), 
  about actual immigrant conditions in the eu : / methinks those people are hoping for way too much . 
  as opposed to germoney using their position & wealth to run greece/italy/spain into the ground for a few more quick bucks , uk saying `` that 's it i quit & close my borders ! '', 
  every odd day & no proper coordination of the answer to the immigration wave ? 
  an eu president would allow for proper eu-wide political coordination , if nothing else . 
   why do people always pretend that less rich people are so eager to pay their damn taxes ? 
  they are n't , but they are n't spending thousands of paying 10 people figuring out day long how to make them richer by frauding , oh sorry `` avoiding '' everything under the sun and even getting them `` corporate welfare '' by bribing enough senators to make it a law . 
   can we please stop with this dumb class warfare rhetoric ? 
  probably around the time where some people in the us are n't trilionnaires that pay their employee the strict legal minimal that do n't land them in prison ( not even 0.001 % of what they have ) , and the water utilities stop going down `` because no money '' because it was all stolen ; & they stop exporting their oligarchic habit in europe under the cover of `` free market '' . 
   he did n't resign to leave . 
  he resigned to make new elections possible and get rid of all the ultra-leftist idiots of his current party . 
  there 's also the part where he wanted validation and not just being blamed of being a dictator who ignore what his own population wants & just surrender everything to foreign powers . 
  if he does n't have popular backing he wo n't get re elected . 
   he will be stronger and with more sane members of parliament after the election that 'd be nice but we 'll see what the population vote, 
   does it offer protection for ukrainians technically at my own level i do support ua 's defensive operation in the east ( the ato ) ; but yeah we acted a bit underwhelming there . 
   solidarity with poles and latvians ? 
  well if russia touch either of them the european & nato tanks will start poping so ...  immigration talks without preconditions and bullying to italians ? 
  that 's very much needed , yes . 
   economic and martial backing to the dutch ? 
  do they need special backing currently ?!?? 
   `` europe '' had proven over and over that its institutions are dysfunctional and have to be goaded into action/cooperation ( sometimes by the us , a hemisphere away , via nato and the imf ) . 
  talking about that , how about you help greece by cutting them a check too & not just a loan by the imf haha ? 
   because there is no european identity i agree the identity is rather weak right now . 
  altho it 's surfacing a bit in front of the immigration wave , ironically . 
   there is no european people `` there is no such thing as an united states of america '' \\ - uk mentality just after hearing of the tea in the harbor  and the policies of the make believe governments it has installed are being ripped at the seams of particular nationals interests . 
  there is definitely a problem there tho . 
  we 'll have to centralize and elect an eu federal president by direct vote at some point imho . 
  well tsipras handed over his resignation so i do n't know . 
  it depends on potentially who might replace him . 
  ( i really hope it 's not the gd nazis :\\ \\ ), 
  well i do n't know how the italian justice wants to handle it , that 's why i said that . 
   but whose society is it ? 
  europe . 
  every country is interdependant on it 's neighbors in the peninsula , whether we like it or not . 
  on every level ( cultural , economic , the one currency thing , population displacements , ... ) . 
  issues that affects one of us affects us all . 
  so if one country collapses due to bad economics , it 'll blew up in all our faces . 
   why not massive fiscal transfers to africa and asia from european coffers ? 
  for the first one it 's simple : what african economy ? 
  : x we do transfer huge amounts of raw natural ressources tho . 
  for the second , they are currently investing huge amounts of money here too ( especially china , japan , a bit sk & taiwan , singapore , ... ) . 
   because you do n't view them as perfectly deserving of it . 
  it 's like taxes , we do n't like paying those because we think other people do n't deserve our money . 
  however they are a system necessity . 
  without it , we do n't have healthcare , infrastructure , power or water airports cops firemen etc etc. 
  at eu level it 's similar , if for example spain really bankrupt , their agriculture could totally nosedive & then you 'd see tomato & other vital prices litterally triple at the supermarket overnight , like if you were in russia right now . 
  or the prices of new construction because they are so invested in it . 
  not even counting the fact that a southern country collapse or paralized gov would mean another massive immigrant wave ( locals and foreigners that pass throught it ) in the rest of europe , that ca n't really handle it ( current levels are already a prob , but imagine half of spain & morocco on top of it , because there 's nothing left for them in spain ) . 
   ah the bitterness , succes always breeds jealousy denouncing crab bucket mentality ( `` fuck the others , i got my own money so everything is ok '' ) & backstabbing is not `` jalousy '' . 
   better get use to it . 
  on the contrary , if this goes on i think you are the one that will have to get used to see `` your own tax money '' go back help a bit fixing some of the damage inflicted in fellow european neighbors . 
   i do n't share your world view german bribery scandals , loan sharking & country bankrupting like greece or spain are n't a `` world view '' . 
   neither have i made the same observation as you did . 
  https://www.google.fr/search?hl=fr&amp;gl=fr&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=german+bribery&amp;oq=german+bribery&amp;gws_rd=ssl btw , the situation is also massively ironic because the german own gov complains about * potential * abuse of potential clauses in potential treaties to do potential dumping against germany : http://www.dw.com/en/avoid-dumping-in-trade-deal-warns-germanys-gabriel/a-17428819 but when germany provenly do it & for example undercut belgium businesses in their own country , then suddenly nobody in germany bats an eye ? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22080862  regardless we do n't live in the same society , well , unless you are out of europe , yes we are . 
  edit : you are from netherlands ? 
  oh , my bad edit2 : to be clear , i 'm french and suspect france should be a net contributor to said fiscal transferts . 
  ie we should give some money too . 
  so , no it 's not about transfering money from germ/nl/whatever to france , but to those that actually need it intra eurozone ( probably italy , greece , spain , portugal / ireland or similar ) . 
  ~ ~ this is horrible . 
  i hope they find the culprit ~ ~ and jail him or deport him . 
  edit : i 'm stupid they already caught him : `` mr kamara was arrested after police searched his bag on sunday as he returned to the migrant centre . '', 
   how nice of you , would you mind picking it up , or attempt to explain its relevancy ? 
  i would say exactly the same . 
  i point out german dumping & total disregard of minimal wage or proper working condition , or simply not being arses to all their neighbors , and you just answer `` but italian corruption ! '' . 
   i do n't care how , as long as it 's not from our tax money . 
  ( ... ) it 's not my problem as long as its not from our taxes ah right ; the entire planet can be in half hell but who cares if you have enough money in your pocket . 
  greeks can be starving due to mafia-level loan sharking from germany , italians can be destroyed by corruption fostered by german corporate bribery , spain can be economically drowned by german dumping after loosing all their money investing in industries & infra that were undercut to bankruptcy by german slave-ran business , but no just like you state , you do n't give a fuck as long as you german are rich . 
  that damn mentality you share is damaging to society . 
   so that french people can keep working 35 hours , and italians can remain corrupt , and there will be no reason to change that . 
  i 'll just leave this here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism  change their ways and become competitive ? 
  by abolishing minimal wage , paying east germans then random immigrants 50 $ / mo to run our factories on slave work and crippling all our neighbors with debts and political embezzlement , then bribing all their politicians to buy your own shit without ever delivering it ( do n't forget then to freeze the refund in the name of an anti corruption inquiry . 
  ignore blatantly all the cdu politicians that took kickbacks in it & stall the inquiry 12 years so that everyone forget you kept all the money & goods . 
  then make a huge media campaign to destroy said country 's reputation as `` lazy corrupt moochers that refuse to pay back german debts '' . 
  siemens , rheinmetal , all the big german corps did it ... ) ? 
   redistribute the profits of the ecb directly into the bank accounts of the citizens of the eurozone ( same amount for everyone ) a citizen 's dividend of the eurozone 's wealth ? 
  while a lot of people here might like the idea , the gov officials of various countries then would n't be able to steal all that money anymore or redirect it as they like ; so they will never agree to it . 
  ( the greeks are collectively ultra pissed because germany used greece 's corruption as an excuse to loot their economy with the last `` agreement '' . 
  and looks like some of the germans are in fact just as corrupt ), 
   given how influential macron is ( i see him as a potential future french president ) i suspect that these comments will get a lot of traction .
