   i can tell you to go fuck yourself because more people know about the french atrocities in algeria than you think ? 
  that was our parents , not our generation . 
  corruption is a * current * problem . 
  and one of the biggest topics on the table in europe right now . 
  and scandinavia 's probably the least corrupt area on earth . 
  besides , saying it 's an `` inefficiency '' there is like saying the whole state burning in a wildfire is an `` inconvenience '' . 
   your response is that , the american system contains its own inefficiencies . 
  no , it 's just i have a very hard time to shake away the feeling that scandinavia getting called out for tax fraud/evasion/corruption / corporate fraud by the usa in 2015 is a bit like getting called out on human rights by china ( especially china 10 years ago ) . 
  well i have in mind a bad example in a certain country that has big problems with police violence and people getting for example gunned down when reaching for their id like the courageous policemen asked them : bad example that we do n't want to copy on that point . 
  so forgive me for finding the use of firearms curious when they are not directly threathened by one . 
  but oh well , on the other hand it 's true we do n't yet know everything about that case . 
  well when people get political asylum abroad they are political ennemies of the people in charge in their home country, 
   the idea is good , but i imagine flanders-like people that will invade the privacy of honest people . 
  i 'm not really sure if the trade off will be positive . 
  well they should not ask to hand over people over their religion or being suspiciously brown and in the wrong neighborhood . 
  but they definitely should be asking you warn the autorities if somebody is about to go suicide bombing or joigning beheading central in levant . 
  well i hope we will put the exact proportionally same kind of limits on swiss movements in eu . 
  if switzerland reinstate visas & visa quotas , so should we . 
  shengen 's not a one way street . 
   i suppose the guys who will suffer most will be all those dudes out east and down south who used to get all the free money . 
  looking at the situation in greece , they 're not `` taking '' all the money , we 're are taking it north . 
  and in the case of greece , the northern creditors merely agreed to take 50 % less away from greece . 
  either that or he tried to imply that right sektor did a favor to russia without realizing when blowing up [ their own power lines ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/paris_tuileries_garden_facepalm_statue.jpg ) ; and the whole point got lost somewhere along the line . 
   i think it 's healthy if every country 's populace at least inquires how it 's tax dollars are allocated . 
  it 's not a bad thing . 
  it 's a prudent thing . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  that 's true , you 're right, 
  my point was `` if you want to fix the misallocation of tax money so bad , why do n't you start in the us first with a situation that bad , instead of telling us what to do '' . 
  but yeah i guess i went a bit far , sorry, 
  well sorry for the `` wattaboutism '' but by my own standard i would say 30-60 % of the money in the us is led astray in a few pockets one way or another ( ridiculously low wages , stolen money , corporation above taxes , bribery , `` corporate subsidies '' , ridiculously inflated prices , etc etc ) so a 5 % bloat in an eu country would appear pretty small next to it and i find it funny , if unsurprizing , to see an us citizen complaining about the high taxes . 
  high taxes is just the system 's way of saying `` it 's not yours to take all the money in the system ; you got to school and healthcare ( free of charge btw ) and we ensured you got a retirement , now let others have the same , and no it 's not negociable '' . 
   the citizens are too damn smug and comfortable to question anything . 
  well if they have a lifestyle that seriously high above everyone else , maybe it works out better for them that way and to simply pay a bit more taxes ? 
  it 's an investment ... 
   and those that are more wealthy would feel like they 're getting basically nothing from the state . 
  well , apart roads for their business , an education before , advanced healthcare the day they get sick ( because not even the wealthy can always afford multi million $ surgeries in the us ) , advanced infrastructure in perfect shape , subsidized fast internet access that does n't try to scam you over , utilities that do n't go down everytime there 's a storm and do n't cost 1000 $ per month , etc etc. 
  maybe using baton or a taser or tear gaz etc would be more adapted than shooting people ? 
  : / there 's a reason cops have non lethal weapons at their disposal . 
   yet there are zero stories of people being arrested or killed in said prevention . 
  to answer your edit : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34830233 https://www.rt.com/news/322244-france-anti-terror-raids/ http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/paris-terror-attacks/paris-attacks-2-000-raids-210-arrests-state-emergency-n471886 http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/30/europe/germany-terror-arrests/ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/berlin-terror-raid-two-suspected-islamists-arrested-at-mosque-where-bomb-attack-was-being-planned-a6750196.html http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mosque-berlin-germany-raided-police-arrest-islamist-extremists/ etc. 
  but oh well paying a bit of attention would n't hurt . 
   but not cop21 protests read my history for that one . 
  essentially assigning a few known greenpeace radicals to residence is nowhere as bad as the trial and jail that await isis would be suicide bombers . 
  http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/649/078/dbb.jpg joke apart ; you 're not looking for a serious answer but for a reason to complain, 
   that is , you know , abroad , in another country you ca n't ignore a civil war next door spilling on your country and pretend everything is fine while they export you terrorists . 
   more traffic deaths since the attack in france already ... because the services successfully prevented another dozen attack . 
  and next time they slip again , what happends ? 
  do n't you think it 's better to close that one ? 
  now do n't mistake me , the solution is n't `` kill everyone afghanistan war style '' , far from it . 
  apart the whole daesh/nusra problem , the rest is likely more diplomacy , economic pressure & stuff like that . 
   christianity underwent a reformation and is far more benign now due to secular pressure after another 500-1000y long dark age with stuff like crusades and spanish inquisition , yes . 
  so why should n't we put secular pressure on the muslims too ? 
   presumably the states of emergency are allowed by the constitution . 
  yes , but not continously without reasons . 
  as the `` of emergency '' speaks , the gov can only invokate it during an emergency . 
  mass attempts at terrorists attacks stopped in the last few months and the massive bataclan attacks are a legitimate motive tho . 
  just my own opinion but : it 'll probably last for the duration of the syrian/iraqi civil war to be honest . 
  if we want to fix our terror problem , we need to end that one first ( and possibly libya : / ) . 
  then once that one is over , we clean up a bit & solve the refugee crisis ( which will be less of a problem if violence cease ) and can abolish it/let it expire ( and/or kick in the chins anyone trying to renew it then ) . 
   presumbably they can they judge the legitimacy of states of emergency ? 
  de facto , pretty much . 
  they hold a veto on what they think is ignoring the spirit of the constitution & basis of french law . 
  if they think it 's honestly bs , they 'll scrap the next renewal . 
   did the investigations get quashed by the rich and powerful , or was evidence too hard to find ? 
  i got the feeling that swiss banks would rather have more mafia/tax fraud money/nazi gold than actually clean up their house ... 
  it 's how they got that rich after all . 
  you are basically describing a problem that is identical in christianism . 
  yet they managed to calm down and stop their crusades and killing everyone . 
  most muslim i know in france are n't big either on the whole `` mass killing '' thing either , and condemned daesh terrorist attacks . 
  the average word seems to be `` no matter if they insult you or your religion , it 's not a valid reason to murder and torture '' . 
   when laws created by men conflict with the laws of god , i will follow the laws created by men . 
  all of that is good . 
  well , the bible is actually pretty vengefull too . 
  does n't mean the average christian does a shooting . 
  i suspect most people can learn to read the spirit of the book rather than the letter , and the rest well should be taught by people that can ( ie moderate imams , religious councils etc ) . 
  you know what they say about the state control of medias ? 
  well , there you go . 
  no reason not to at least put red lines not to cross ( do not murder , do not stone , treat women as equal , etc etc )  that means it 's difficult to just ignore the most violent verses well , i suspect you did survived wearing article of mixed fabrics in public and likely had n't your tongue tore away for lying once in your life ( leveticus & deuteronomy in the bible ) soo ...  the problem is that there 's no central authority in islam and its sects i guess that was the logic behind sarkozy 's idea for the muslim cult in france . 
  creating our own version of ayatollahs but less fundamentalists . 
   so please forgive me if i have my doubts about a theological council 's ability to solve these issues once and for all . 
  i certainly wo n't pretend it will solve everything . 
  far from the truth in fact , extremists will act regardless . 
  but i do suspect it is one of many possible step in the right direction , and it might help reduce the issue with very little price or social sacrifice . 
  so we 'd be making a mistake not to do it . 
  well if it 's like western services , they can just peek in the old logs around the name of whoever is arrested and they 'll get everything either way . 
  so it 's not a valid reason to tolerate an open slave market in a nato country that prided itself in it 's modernity next to most of the middle east . 
   they will try , but i 'm pretty sure this is not how islam works . 
  and what are they going to do ? 
  ignore half of the quran ? 
  ~ ~ / r/worldnews ~ ~ / r/atheism is leaking once again  _   why should french muslims recognize such a council 's authority ? 
  likely because they 'd want french nationality , to live here , to get welfare when appropriate etc. 
  it 's called a social contract . 
  if you want the same right as everyone else you got ta follow the same duties as everyone else . 
  no special passes for muslims or catholics ( who have their own representants too ) or whatever . 
   they want to copy the way napol\u00e9on france assimilated french jews , and i agree , but those were different times and different people . 
  well do you have better ideas than trying to copy what was known to work ? 
  i hope turkey will close down that operation fast enough if there 's any truth in it . 
  human traficking is a scourge . 
  edit : for the sake of clarification , i do not blame turkey for everything done by the mafia when they are n't looking .
