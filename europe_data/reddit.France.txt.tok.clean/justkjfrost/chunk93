  like the great freemarket 's us one where anything from going to school to seeing a doc to even dying means bankruptcy for your family ? 
  oh but i 'm sure the prices of dairy is a lot more worrying / s  the us should n't still be making ties and shirts because then the cost for ties and shirts would be astronomical . 
  maybe it should , because if people kept not having a job ( or welfare , but it 's a dirty word in the usa ; except obviously if you put the word `` corporate '' in front of it ) for it they 'll not be able to buy those ties and shirt down the line . 
   despite that fact , an isds tribunal found romania in breach of an investment treaty between that country and sweden , which is where the investors were based , and obliged romania to pay more than $ 250 million what the hell ? 
  this is a shakedown system . 
   the case is a perfect demonstration of how isds tribunals regard themselves above not just national law , but eu rules too . 
  yep , looks like we have a problem . 
  always lovely to learn about the extent of things in the press  the meinl bank action is notable because the harm is allegedly the result of investigations by the county 's justice department . 
  might i suggest they go f ** k themselves lest they want to get investigated too for interfering with justice , mafia practices , corruption & blackmail , and probably the money laundering they are likely trying to hide ? 
   we can also use past experience as a guide for the total value of the claims this might give rise to . 
  as mentioned above , we know that 62 of the cases that have been brought against 20 eu member states since 1994 involve claims of $ 30 billion ( # 21 billion ) in total . 
  crudely speaking then , we might expect those 100 future isds cases to see claims totalling around $ 50 billion ( # 33 billion ) . 
  of course , this is not the actual amount that is likely to be awarded by the tribunals , but it gives a very rough idea of the magnitude of the costs that isds is likely to impose on the eu : tens of billions of euros in just the first few years of ttip . 
  those losses might in fact offset the benefits of the trade agreement , by several levels . 
  it now looks like if the usa wants that trade agreement , we should ask them to cut those isds clauses entirely . 
  we have no reason to sacrifice away ( ah , ironic for me to say it but ... ) our sovereignty to corporate-led `` courts '' who refuses to recognize any laws or even constitution ( * ... the claimant 's lawyer replied that this well-established separation of powers was not recognised by isds tribunals , and was therefore irrelevant ... * ) and who will only use them to siphon and award themselves or their friends vasts sum of money from our governments to their personnal accounts . 
  this is just as corrupt as some of the old practices in ukraine a couple years ago . 
  we pushed out yanukovich 's cronies , and it 's not to ask the us oligarchs to replace him and start doing exactly the same europe wide . 
  and especially not in secret courts with secret justice used just to plunder everything by the countless billions and hide it . 
  well , here 's something erdogan could agree with if he wants to recover cred with others , i hope . 
  obviously on condition that the pkk put back weapons in the armory and stop shooting people in turkey . 
  sounds like a ( valid ) plan . 
  i hope it 's put into practice, 
   i 'm not calling france a failed state . 
  it 's obvious that the preferred solution from the french side is that these people unfortunately manage to smuggle themselves out of france . 
  oh so this is what this `` france is somalia '' fantasy is about . 
  you 're another uk xenophobic citizen who are afraid that `` the foreigners wave will steal all my foodz and money . 
  hide yo kids hide yo wife '' . 
   so as a driver , you 're stuck between trying to keep people out of your vehicle ah yes , so listening to you random isolated incidents become `` thousands of immigrants attacked hundreds of drivers every days !, 
  avoid the highway of death !!! '' . 
   and being reasonably certain of a criminal record , possible prison time and fines and losing their jobs if they let them come into the uk . 
  as far as i know , every single of those outcomes is an invention . 
  please quote me a single case were either of those happened . 
   this is what you get without meaningful enforcement . 
  people will start killing eachother eventually . 
  leaving the drivers unprotected like this will lead to bad outcomes , and i do n't just mean drivers getting prosecuted for self-defense measures . 
  this is ridiculous and fear mongering . 
  alright police upgrade might be adapted , but listening to people here you 'd think it 's mad max . 
  it 's like when the us media started calling belgium a `` failed country '' . 
  can we stop exagerating things that much ? 
  edit : lol at the downvote wave & comments . 
  i love how people who never set foot in france tries to teach me how my home country is an african warzone, 
  actually i was talking mostly about the new turkish intrusions , and the greek `` counter intrusion '' that generally follow shortly after . 
  yeah that 's what i 'm talking about when i was speaking about saving fuel . 
   there is nothing in your sources linking greenpeace to any of the bombings or the killing of a waitress . 
  the second wiki link has no traduction , sorry . 
  greenpeace had serious political ties in the gov and used them to clean up after themselves at the time . 
  revealing them would have implicated several high level politicials so they `` killed '' half the investigation . 
  but , to link what i can easily prove : - an ecologist peasant known as jose bov\u00e9 led multiple non deadly attack on mcdonalds and was condemned/tried for it : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a9montage_du_mcdonald%27s_de_millau the guy was a green old-peasant-era radical : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_bov%c3%a9 - he did jail for it . 
  and incidently he 's ( still ) member of the political party `` europe ecologie les verts '' ( translation : europe , ecology and green/environmental people ) : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_%c3%89cologie_les_verts while the party are mostly not crazy fringe people themselves , crazy people tend to orbit around that one . 
  - back to greenpeace , they were well known at the time for hanging around bov\u00e9 's buddies and helped him attacking/destroying ogm fields publickly dozens of times arguing that since the ogm were n't yet legal they were illegal and since it was they were burning to the ground illegal fields they could n't be sued to begin with ( yes , it does not work that way , but it 's greenpeace so ... v.v ) . 
  they still do so nowadays , albeit without the burning part : http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2014/05/02/jose-bove-et-greenpeace-fauchent-un-champ-d-ogm_4410772_3244.html http://agriculture.greenpeace.fr/ogm-destruction-de-champs-illegaux ecologist radicals kept attacking stuff including mcdonalds without getting caught most of the time . 
  except once the waitress was caught in the blast of the latest attack and people started going to jail by the dozen , of course they deleted every ties they could and suddenly claimed non violence . 
  concerning the incident with the ships i ca n't find a public source , i 'll have to drop that claim i guess . 
   or blowing up mcdonalds with dynamite ? 
  it 's a reccuring thing in france that one : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/mcdonald%27s#progression_en_chiffre_d.27affaires mcdonalds is the very symbol of the export of american capitalism so it used to be regularly targetted . 
  again , here 's an article from greenpeace themselves , sanitized : http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/i-m-trashin-it/ and i say sanitized because at some point they helped attack the quevert mcdonalds too , except they killed a waitress this time : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/affaire_de_pl%c3%a9vin then suddenly everyone in the green world was busy forgetting they ever had anything against mcdonalds . 
  yelling `` you make shit up '' when reality does n't fit your view does n't make it true . 
  you are an idiot . 
   lol , no its not , you just got caught making shit up . 
  that can actually fall under diffamation ; and they can theorically pursue you for it * even if you stated the truth * . 
  that one : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/diffamation_en_droit_fran%c3%a7ais edit : http://www.dossierfamilial.com/sante-social/police-et-justice/diffamation-injure-calomnie-que-risquez-vous-54504, 
  according to french law it is illegal to reveal other people 's legal past if they are not public figures ; and i do n't feel like pointing names sorry . 
   guess `` innocent until proven otherwise '' does not mean much in france anymore . 
  when recidivists say have repeated evil laugh while stating that they are `` already at work to find creative ways to take action and ensure that the future climate agreement will not be the work only of government negotiators but of the people around the world '' and state openly they 'll act at cop21 at such dates and taunt repeatedly the police `` who ca n't do anything about it because human rights oppressed '' during a state of emergency and when actual terrorists are quite a priority above attention seeking idiots ; you do n't wait to find out what they invented next in your back . 
  do you have anything that indicate that the services and the minister are all wrong and that they only intended to protest peacefully with signs and absolutely without interfering with anything , looking at greenpeace 's past and their laughing at `` creative ideas '' ( their own terms ) ? 
  exactly . 
  and if he wrote a measure `` arrest those 20 gp idiots that plot something and stuck them at home '' maybe there 's a reason ... ? 
  i 'm sure top tiers ministers personally come to arrest every activists around , like they only have that to do in normal time : \u00b0, 
   there is a huge difference between saying something and plotting . 
  well cazaneuve himself defended it which means services are likely implicated which means they likely caught them by eavesdropping once the gp started smuggly laughing, 
  so what is that ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspiracy_to_murder https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspiracy_ ( criminal ) plotting to do it is an action . 
  even if the plan has n't moved yet to it 's final phase . 
  again , i can easily prove the assault on the plateform ; from the horse 's own mouth : http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/recent/greenpeace-activists-board-oil-platform-in-russian-arctic/ and they were n't hiding that bit but proud of it . 
  and yes , when people come aboard illegally and take over , that 's piracy . 
  but of course now faced with jail sentances suddenly they denied having any weapons and `` it was a joke bro '' . 
   so they were planing to march without a permit ? 
  oh please . 
  their history as a group is dynamiting mcdonalds , high sea piracy and sinking japanese whaler ships with sea mines . 
  do you truly believe they 'd just walk with a few signs ? 
   universal human rights are universal . 
  human rights does not include storming places under military lockdown just after terrorists attacks just to prove you can . 
   i do n't think it 's ok for the police to use special powers they were given to fight quite specific terrorist treat on those protesters . 
  and i do n't think it 's ok either for greenpeace to plot something most likely 100 % illegal at cop21 either nor taunt the cops about it, 
   places greenpeace quasi eco terrorists under house arrest after public boasting on their websites that they would ignore openly state of emergency and any laws to do what they want and do some antics at the conference to draw attention ftfy they mellowed their message on their site since but you can steal hear what they were thinking ... http://marchemondialepourleclimat.fr/en/ quoting :  `` regarding both november 29 and december 12 in paris , the french coalition is already at work to find creative ways to take action and ensure that the future climate agreement will not be the work only of government negotiators but of the people around the world . '', 
  ( and by antics i mean they 're the people who recruited a paramilitary commando to make a raid and steal an offshore gaz plateform by force like if piracy was a perfectly tolerable thing : http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/recent/greenpeace-activists-board-oil-platform-in-russian-arctic/ ), 
  yeah and neither are french banlieux haha . 
  much exageration have been made . 
  just do n't get caught at midnight in a dark street . 
  radicalization there , drugs , mafia and poverty are a serious issue tho . 
   well , pardon me but that `` undeniable proof '' sounds like a conspiracy theory . 
  are you by any chance sub r/conspiracy ? 
  really . 
  you expect them to publish bank statements on the guardian frontpage ? 
  ( no , do n't actually answer that one , they agreed not to publish anymore stuff that could endanger someone in particular or destabilize a country , after the big wikileaks assange scandale )  do you think is skykes picot our fault ? 
  no , i think europe did the incredible mess in the middle east , and then turkey independantly tried to push out the kurds and that created the current situation where neither syria , nor iraq , nor turkey wanted kurds . 
  and until the americans had a change of hearth a few decades ago , we were just as guilty in making the kurds stateless . 
   also what the fuck is `` raising the turkmen population in se turkey '' asaik there is n't any significant numbers of turkmens here in turkey in general let alone south eastern parts of the country . 
  well ; you know ataturk supposedly killed a * large * number of kurds and offered the land to turkish citizens to make what was defacto ethnic kurdistan more turkish ?
