   europe has the right , and i would say the obligation , to stop immigrants from entering illegally , no matter how many decide to try . 
  it wo n't stop millions from trying to pass in eastern europe , at winter , during storms where the coast guards are away or when people are n't looking . 
   your 8-10 times higher salary makes a damn difference , you hypocrite !!, 
  you think the average french live on 8 time the same salary ? 
  xd well ; let 's look beyond huge numbers for a minute . 
  the average middle class `` decent pay '' wage in france is like 1000-2000 $ for 50/60h/week . 
  looking at my past economic life and people i know lived , on those 2000 $ you can expect like : - 1000/1200 $ for the home ( rent , utilities , etc ) - 200 $ / person food - car bills ( i 'm not sure , i never really used a car myself . 
  but i guess loan if appliable + insurance mandatory again 100e + gaz 150 $ + 100-200 $ / mo of maintenance like oil brakes fluids repairs etc ? 
  expect 500 $ / mo all in ? ), 
  - 100 $ / mo other mandatory insurances - 20-30 % of your wage to save for the taxes - various unexpected fees that inevitably fall like school textbooks , cloths , uncovered medical in the multi hundreds most people in france are left * with 100/200 $ at the end of the month around passed the bills . 
  * you might buy yourself a game console and computer a year ; and then that 's it . 
  * western europe basically use euros like russia use rubbles or ukraine use hryvnas . 
  * importing electronics and appliances and cars and some goods is cheaper due to conversion rates , but that 's it . 
   ( except maybe for housing , but you usually rent anyway ) well if housing rent is half your wage when you actually live as an adult and taxes half of the rest ... 
  i guess you did n't paid either as an exchange student and got hosted for free ? 
  you think 99 % of the western population got either of that ? 
  haha . 
  i 'll try that one with the landlord one day / s and as for switzerland , it 's another place that refused to join the eu exactly because they refuse paying taxes or contributing in it to maintain their bullshit standard built upon fiscal fraud & mafia money from everywhere else in europe . 
  they 're a giant fiscal parasite we have to bully and harass to get them to help us root out frauders with stolen billions and even then they are lying and covering for frauding banks and mafia people half the time . 
  so do n't use them as an excuse , we have about as much direct control over switzerland as we have over russia : z e r o. 
   why did i receive so much more money than most easterners who do a lot more work in many cases ? 
  because you were lucky . 
  most people end up shafted , and in france unpaid internship while paying the rent with borrowed money or living in your parent 's basement was the norm in education until a few years ago ( we had to make the unpaid part outright illegal for obvious reasons ) . 
  so you think because you got lucky everyone else is a `` lazy moocher that get money for doing nothing '' ? 
   what did they do wrong , when did they choose to have a lower living standard ? 
  nothing . 
  but , in fact , looking big picture , the germans and french get in fact just as fucked , even if that makes you scream . 
  the real problem might be in all those banks and megacorps that get dozens of trillions ( yes , * trillions * . 
  as in like [ 16 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 ' 000 $ ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2011/09/20/the-feds-16-trillion-bailouts-under-reported/ ) ) of bailouts and oligarchs that roll over obscene amounts of money while everyone lives upon a couple hundreds or thousands . 
  we also had a 20/30 years headstart due to staline more busy genociding people in siberia than actually building the economy in eastern europe , and he did n't ruled western europe . 
  and that really does n't help either because nowadays in the eu proper it 's less industry ( which was easy to build by tossing raw money at the problem ) and a bit more the tertiary sector . 
  going back to modern times once again , it 's easier to think the germans are getting money they should n't than to get whoever stole that billion in moldova to put it back ; and to pay due taxes they fraud and using that to rebuild the economy or pay welfare with it is n't it ? 
  `` oh yeah you are exagerating , looking for a scape goat in corporations '' . 
  well , to put it bluntly and help you understand : - watch this image : https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rmhvyeqpoce/maxresdefault.jpg eastern europe is at 0 % , western europe at 50 % , and the corporations at the extreme right . 
  - if companies in eastern europe where paying to the state their proper taxes and the politicians where n't embezzling the rest , you could easily all have 200 $ / mo of workfare falling from the sky no string attached on top of your current income , without modifying anything else . 
  so is it really the german or french fault for that one ? 
  the normal is n't 100 or 2000 . 
  * it should be 10k $ / mo , like in finland * . 
  and the money is there . 
  but obviously that 's never going to happen and we 're going to keep blamming each other 's countries and immigrants currently surviving on charity while 90 % of the economy disappear in a few pockets . 
   did n't a revolution start in iran due to this enforced goals in 79 , they ended very nicely right ? 
  uhhhhhh . 
  since that reddit account might be used against me later down the line i 'm not going to really speak my mind on that subject . 
  but , the iranian revolution invited much ... radical religion in their country ( the name ayatollah khomeini might ring a bell ? ) . 
  which might or might not be heavily linked with a lot of social trouble they are facing right now , and a lot of trouble the middle east are therefore facing . 
  oh and half the coups in iran where in fact organized by the cia if you dig a bit , btw . 
  i know how things run in ukraine and that people get 200 $ / mo , thanks . 
  and while we have bigger numbers on paper , it 's not always better de facto because prices are higher ( the rent of my basic flat in france is 600 $ / mo without even counting utilities or mandatory insurance so ... ) . 
  1 \u00b0 ) it avoid massively antagonizing surviving syrians who would otherwise embrace daesh if only for their own survival , if not by sheer embitterment . 
  or even worse end up in power later with a big axe to grind with us . 
  2 \u00b0 ) we have a population aging issue in europe . 
  call me cynic , but young work age people taking all those jobs nobody wants for pay nobody wants either will help funding the system when looking big picture . 
  they 'll help pay our retirement that we wo n't be able to pay in 20y otherwise . 
  3 \u00b0 ) once the war is over , a big part of them will go back to rebuild . 
  4 \u00b0 ) test run for what do we do in several decades when africa decide they 'd like to all live in europe , and a lot of other issues . 
  once again , collecting experience and data will prove invaluable down the line . 
  knowing how to react and handle a large influx of people that 'll sneak in regardless of laws will be helpfull . 
  yet the second there is no money , people will blame each other ( or foreigner first ) instead of looking at how the money is actually allocated . 
  which is how you end up with ukraine where people where blamming each others in kiev because they were nearly starving while yanukovich was busy filling his plane with some of the multiples tons of gold laying around in his [ various litteral gold plated palaces ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2571408/new-pictures-eye-opening-opulence-ousted-ukrainian-president-yanukovichs-palace-sprawling-estate-tourist-attraction.html ) . 
  ( when they realized and it became euromaidan ) this `` the immigrants are getting eveything ! '', 
  is the very symbole of it . 
  no , they are getting even less scraps than you . 
  how about we recover the actual pot of gold missing instead of going after scapegoats barely escaping war zones ? 
   but apparently they do n't matter as much as refugees . 
  that 's not true . 
  infrastructure , education & healthcare for our citizens is like 3/4 ( that is 75 % + ) or more of the budget of most western states : - usa http://origin.factcheck.org/images/image/2011/articles/fiscal%20factcheck/2010%20pie%20chart.png - germany http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jihgfty3a0c/umpam2myoai/aaaaaaaaahw/qwxvn23hqxc/s1600/spending-structure-of-the-2012-federal-budget,property=default.jpg - france http://www.pressenza.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/budget_france_2010_piechart.png etc. 
  and the refugees is like 2 % of the budget . 
  vs 75 % on the local citizens . 
  but apparently if you spend any amount ( even 10 $ ) on anyone , it 's `` you do n't care about us greedy idiot ! '' . 
  it 's a common and major fallacy tho . 
  one observed times and times again . 
  in the usa , everyone think they spend 30 % of the budget on foreign help while it 's less than 2 % : http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/201974-the-top-myths-about-us-foreign-aid but off course , it 's easier to make a cover `` immigrants are thiefs ! '', 
  because everyone talk about the subject than for example looking at the ** 15-20 % of the budget stolen in some eastern countries ** by corrupt politicians . 
  ah but of course , admitting that `` our '' politician is corrupt is also a lot more difficult ( ponta , sarkozy , yanukovich , berlusconi , ... ) , so back to blamming immigrants it is !, 
   will do , as soon as we stop feeling the consequences of choices made 70 years ago , by everyone but us . 
  look , there are forests i ca n't walk in france because there 's so much fucking ammo everywhere in the ground . 
  i did n't choose that either . 
  we all have to deal with ( poor , bad , * terrible * ) choices made by others and go on with our lives . 
  what people do * now * , themselves , is certainly their responsability . 
  countries and people should stop blamming everyone else for what our ancestors did . 
  that was 70-80y ago , and my bet is you did n't lived it either . 
   which is n't going to happen for another 50 if not more . 
  right , i 'm sure taking a few refugees surely compare with stalines pogroms by the dozens of millions / s. 
  it 's almost as if the people in charge 70 years ago and now were n't the same and try different things / s. 
  now , can we stop using wwii and the nazis/staline as an excuse for blatantly refusing to do everything we do n't like without thinking ? 
  actually iirc while it is large , most of our manufactured weapons are sold to foreign countries , so they do n't need a state of emergency to line up their pockets . 
  if anything , we might limit export away from a lot of countries during the emergency state ( cf the suspended mistrals ) . 
   the courts ca n't decide what constitutes as an emergency because that is the parliament 's job . 
  the only question is if parliament agrees to continue it . 
  actually they can . 
  the parliament can vote on it , and even if it pass they can ask the constitution court for a second opinion . 
  which might decide it is unconstitutionnal if it is abusive and not respecting the spirit of the original emergency state law . 
  de facto , the state of emergency can probably go on for the duration of the syrian/iraq war an refugee crisis while there is an actual proven risk of terrorism . 
  once that war is settled , the gov wo n't be as easily able to prolongate it . 
  give it possibly 2 years . 
  less if the war is over quickly and we can settle the refugee question & resettle/rebuild in syria ( and therefore send back a lot of young men ) . 
  hollande is n't accused of selling out the country . 
  the right wingers merely yell that he 's ~ ~ the antichrist here to steal their money and kids to muslimise them like obama ~ ~ he 's `` incompetent '' ( i disagree with that , but that 's just me . 
  people expected instant magic 100 % change over night while limitating his power to prevent a pharao soo ... ) . 
  and sarkozy is n't incompetent , but he 's accused of being a corrupt crook that want to go back in power to get immunity from his past shady deals , berlusconi or ponta style .
