  welcome to / r/europe . 
  see my reply to the other comment . 
  you 're neutral only up to a point . 
  if another eu country requires aid against an armed aggression , you will be legally bound to help them -- that 's not full `` neutrality '' . 
  nonsense . 
   furthermore , the eu 's collective assistance obligation must respect the ` specific, 
  `` neutral '' ? 
  they 're part of the eu . 
  they can claim to be `` neutral '' all they want , but they 're not . 
  the fact that the elected representative of the european people vote on something is proof for you that the eu is tyrannical ? 
  you 're not the sharpest crayon in the box are you ? 
  go to / r/shitamericanssay and behold all your fellow countrypeople who think that the usa is more diverse than homogeneous europe . 
  sweden is not even part of nato . 
  are you so lonely that you need to call strangers `` my friend '' and `` mate '' to feel better ? 
  that 's a bit pathetic . 
  did i say it did ? 
  the fact that you 're an idiot babbling about things you did n't even try to inform yourself about is what gives me some superiority over you , 
  yep , i 'm somewhat mad . 
  you 're a rambling idiot . 
  guess which is worse ? 
   let 's not apply mental gymnastics here . 
  you mean `` let 's not consider the context and behave as if we were morons who are unable to understand something if it 's not written in plain words '' ? 
  i think you 're useless and are contributing to worsening the state of this sub with your ignorant babbling . 
   the `` last night '' refers to a program about sweden on fox . 
  yeah , a program where they described a fake attack . 
  yeah . 
  whatever . 
  stop wasting everyone 's time . 
   the website is not on yet [ wtf are you talking about ... ] ( https://crosscheck.firstdraftnews.com/france-fr/ ) you were n't even aware that the website had launched already ? 
  why the fuck are you wasting everyone 's time ? 
  do you enjoy vomiting opinions about things you know nothing about ? 
  sure . 
  whatever you say . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/19/sweden-trump-cites-non-existent-terror-attack liar . 
   we do n't need other people to tell us with is true and what is n't when it comes to this . 
  how are you going to check whether a terror attack really happened in sweden after a certain orange person claims that it did ? 
  are you going to travel there and ask around to see if it 's true ? 
  even if you do that , why should the people who answer you be considered trustworthy ? 
  well you 're in luck then . 
  as mentioned in the title , the article , and the organization 's website , it 's a ** fact ** - checker . 
  they check objective facts . 
  if you 'd taken a few seconds to look at the website , you 'd see what kind of things they 're checking , and it 's not subjective opinions on policy . 
  it 's bs that circulates on the internet like `` this firefighter got his eye taken after an ` urban ' assaulted him but the president did n't go to his hospital bed ! '', 
  ( guess what , he lost his eye during a protest , and it was a cop who shot him ) . 
  please , in the future , try to at least inform a tiny bit about an issue before blabbing on about it without checking if any of your preconceptions are true . 
  i 'm sorry , i must have missed something , but since it 's rather important for your point i might as well ask . 
   i do n't need people telling me if what i read is fake or not , especially since the guys that tells me is a news organization how the fuck are you going to check if the alleged terror attack in bowling green is true , genius ? 
  are you going to travel there and ask around ? 
  or are you going to rely on news organizations ? 
  wtf does this have to do with the eu ? 
  it 's a private initiative . 
  but i guess any opportunity to bash the eu is good . 
  incredible , when you 're polite and make an effort , people are more willing to help !, 
  why do you assume that the eu wants to put the tories in a difficult position ? 
  what 's done is done , now the goal is to get the most out of the situation . 
  `` putting the tories in a difficult situation '' is a secondary goal at best . 
  europe is n't just about this bill and the single market . 
  there are tons of things to discuss . 
  just look at all the steps a country has to take to join the eu . 
  any source at all ? 
  are we just supposed to accept this blindly as truth or meaningful at all ? 
   46 \u2105 ar n't sure whom to vote for and a sizable share do n't know if they would vote no shit , there 's still two months before the election and the official campaign has n't started yet ... !, 
  by the way , the sign '' \u2105 '' means '' [ care of ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/care_of ) '' , not percentage ... 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  i 'm not saying that it 's the `` best '' metric , wtf ? 
  i 'm saying that it 's what people think of when they think `` city '' . 
  the administrative limits are rather arbitrary and political , and the aire urbaine includes towns that nobody in their right mind would say is the same city -- if you live in a big city , i encourage you to check out a map of its urban area and see if you think to yourself `` yeah that outer part is still city x '' . 
  look at the map for toulouse : http://martial.berthot.free.fr/newsite/3ppgeo/influenceurb/carteaireurbaine.jpg ( not to mention the belgian part of the urban area of lille ... ), 
  it 's not subjective ( it 's the insee 's definition and they use it for statistical purposes ) and it 's what most people think of when they think of a city ( a contiguous area of buildings , habitations ) . 
  if there were n't signs you would even know where the administrative city limits where . 
  but okay ... 
  that 's a different thing ... unit\u00e9 urbaine is the city + banlieue , aire urbaine is city + banlieue + the cities in which at least 40 % of the population work in the city . 
  look at [ this map ] ( http://www.aua-toulouse.org/sites/www.aua-toulouse.org/img/jpg/epci2015-au-pu-light.jpg ) of the aire urbaine of toulouse , it 's humongous . 
  for paris , it even expands outside of ile-de-france ... to put it in other words if you live in the unit\u00e9 urbaine you can basically say `` i live in toulouse '' , but if you live in the aire urbaine you would say `` i live near toulouse '' even if you did n't need to be precise . 
  no , it 's actually the fourth biggest `` agglom\u00e9ration '' . 
  the city 's administrative limits are rather small though , it did n't get merged with surrounding `` communes '' for political reasons . 
  ( i decided that my comment was n't really interesting and deleted it before i saw your reply , sorry . ), 
  explain to me how we can have an * effective * union with common defense politics , economical area and natural integration when every change and reform is protracted and can be halted unilaterally by any one of the 28 members of that union ? 
  except that 2016 was about equivalent to 2014 in terms of tourism . 
  so yeah , it matters that the year being compared to was a record year . 
  you ca n't take the top and the bottom of a spike , compare the two , and cry `` catastrophic drop !!!, 
  wow good save, 
  right . 
  when he named the regulations he would repeal because his friends could n't get loans anymore , he named the regulations that prevent people who have been convicted of fraud or misappropriation of funds from getting loans from investment banks . 
  you 're right , in a way it 's a `` bottleneck '' ... 
  are you twelve ? 
  yeah , people were instructed not to go where a fucking terrorist attack was happening for a few hours . 
  hardly `` a country in lockdown '' . 
  hahahahahaha that 's a good one , i had n't heard it before . 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/trump-financial-executive-actions/ obviously `` all '' is hyperbole . 
  not `` all '' regulations are going to be scrapped , of course . 
  but a significant part . 
  you 're not as funny as you think you are , 
  lockdown ?!, 
  where the fuck do you live ? 
  on a military base ? 
  there 's never been a `` lockdown '' . 
  the previous year was a record year for tourism ... presenting the data this way is disingenuous . 
  what a stupid comment .
