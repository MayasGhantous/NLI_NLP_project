  so it 's okay if i come into your house every day and hang the new issue of the daily mail on your wall ? 
  of course not . 
  does you `` banning '' the daily mail from your house in any way , shape , or form , related to what happened during ww2 ? 
  obviously not ... 
  the daily mail is free to publish whatever they want , we do n't have a duty to accept people republishing it here . 
  four rounds since the primaries have two rounds too ... 
  but it does n't make sense to talk about primaries here since the fn does n't hold primaries ( it 's more of an hereditary type of deal ) . 
  the eu is never going to accept a new country and let it keep its own currency . 
  the building of the eu was `` minutiae of government '' . 
  right . 
  maybe if you were living under a rock . 
  there was a spike in late january ... you ca n't take the top of a temporary spike , compare it with today , and say `` it 's fallen '' . 
  this is blatantly dishonest . 
  good catch . 
  i tried searching for `` february '' ( and `` january '' ) like a moron ... 
  ... what 's the date of this article ? 
  i ca n't find it anywhere . 
  typical uninformed anti-eu commenter . 
  `` waaaah why is n't the eu dealing with this problem in addition to the million of things they already do ? 
  - well actually they 've been working on it for a while but these things take time - lalalala ca n't hear you , let 's see what else i can criticize the eu about . '', 
  what guy ? 
  i 'm tired of the double standard -- something good happens , member states take credit ; something bad happens , eu takes the blame . 
  so did the eu itself , why do n't you thank them ? 
  do they know that he basically either has no plan or nobody knows what it is ... ? 
  ... sorry , this makes no sense . 
  you do n't understand what `` rule of law '' means . 
  an emergency overnight vote of a law that prevents the people voting said law from going to prison is not following the rule of law . 
  article 2 of the lisbon treaty :  the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the ** rule of law ** and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values are common to the member states in a society in which pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men prevail . 
  possible sanctions are outlined in article 7 . 
  why does / r/europe have such a hard-on for macron ? 
  gdp is n't the only measure of the strength of a country ... 
   why is n't australia a member of the eu ? 
  because it 's not in europe ?!, 
  wtf kind of question is that ? 
  progressive for australian standards , or progressive for european standards ? 
  keep in mind that obama , for example , is center-right on the european political spectrum ... 
  why the hell is everyone on / r/europe obsessed with macron ? 
  he 's not the messiah ... 
  it 's not common at all in france to commute that far to work . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements took me five seconds , lazy fuck . 
  i know reading is hard , but the document she provided lists possible trade deals with twelve countries : indonesia , the philippines , malaysia , india , china , vietnam , singapore , japan , thailand , myanmar , australia and new zealand . 
  of course china , india and japan are included because it would be weird otherwise , but it also includes countries that just got burned with tpp ... 
  nothing in the question even implies that the country is being attacked . 
  your country could be the one doing the attacking . 
  well for some reason lille , dunkerque and valenciennes ( three cities in the north of france ) are grouped as one `` metropolitan area '' . 
  it takes almost an hour by car to reach either dunkerque or valenciennes from lille ... and it 's basically farms between the three . 
  this `` metropolitan area '' encompasses pretty much the whole d\u00e9partement . 
  in case you do n't speak french , `` bite '' is slang for `` penis '' in french . 
  not really a funny joke ( unless you 're 13 ) , but this way everyone can understand . 
  no , you can definitely renew it . 
  you can basically renew it whenever you want . 
  the national id card is actually valid 15 years now , 10 years for minors . 
  ( though you have to renew it if you have one whose duration was extended but still shows a 10 year validity , if you want to travel to eu countries . ), 
   and he also literally said it was very important to him . 
  no , he said that defense of europe and the west is important to him . 
  not the same thing . 
  except that trump literally said that nato is obsolete . 
   [ `` it 's obsolete , first because it was designed many , many years ago , '' trump said in the bild version of the interview . 
  `` secondly , countries are n't paying what they should '' and nato `` did n't deal with terrorism . '' the times quoted trump saying that only five nato members are paying their fair share . 
  ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-15/trump-calls-nato-obsolete-and-dismisses-eu-in-german-interview ), 
  i dislike both and think they both worked hard to mess up the country . 
  which is rather crazy considering that fillon was the prime minister ... 
  he was the one who implemented all of sarkozy 's policies . 
  fillon is better than sarkozy ... how so , exactly ? 
   real redditors yeah it 's not like anyone can create a reddit account and pretend that they 're someone else . 
  do you even listen to yourself or are you just an idiot ? 
  they are just as much accountable as most counties parliaments and governments . 
  we vote in the legislative elections , and if we do n't like what our representative is doing then we change our vote the next time . 
  then the winning party makes up a commission . 
  is the process very different in your own country ? 
  in mine the only difference is that we directly vote for the head of state , but the government is still responsible to the parliament . 
  on page 3 there 's my signature , and a warning that the passport contains an electronic component and should not be bent/cut/exposed to heat . 
  uh , no ... ? 
  i literally just flipped through mine ( french passport delivered in 2013 ) and could find nothing even related to consular protection . 
   she 's seen 3 french presidents well yeah , there are elections every five years and the same person can only run twice in a row . 
  the only thing this tells you is that sarkozy did n't win the second time he ran . 
  she 's been chancellor for ~ 11 years -- only a little bit more than two mandates for a french president ... 
   basic economics should tell you that the private sector should be rushing to send stuff to space ... and they are ... spacex , boeing , airbus , to name a few , are very heavily involved in sending stuff to space . 
  and again you 're missing the fact that the esa does much more than `` send stuff to space '' . 
  sure . 
  happy shilling , 
  oh how cute , you 're trying to rile me up and deflecting by calling me `` kid '' and ignoring the points i 'm making  any other techniques you 'd like to try ? 
  did you pull these numbers out of your ass ? 
  or did you get them from a pamphlet ? 
  your comment history is rather amazing , exclusively in / r/europe , pretty much all the posts are bashing the eu or praising russia . 
  okay . 
  also you realize that the budget pays for other things than the salary ? 
  if you want to buy a telescope or send stuff in orbit the local buying power is irrelevant . 
  yeah , 50 years ago . 
  now convert the rubles to euros , and add the budget of all the national space agencies for the eu . 
  [ russia 's space budget is about to be cut by 30 % . 
  ] ( http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/russian-space-program-to-match-nasas-annual-budget-over-the-next-decade/ ) [ in 2015 , the russian space agency had a budget of about 186.5 billion rubles . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roscosmos_state_corporation ) that 's about 3 billion euros . 
  [ esa itself had a budget of 5.25 billion euros in 2016 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency ) and this does n't even account for national spending of eu member states : for example the [ french space agency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cnes ) had a budget of 2.126 billion euros in 2015 . 
  your comment is laughably and utterly wrong . 
  you are a liar . 
  tell that to les r\u00e9publicains ... 
  the party changed names at least 5-6 since 1968 !,
