cultural identity is like layers . 
  you can have one or several local , regional , national , and continental identities , and be equally proud of all of them . 
  *** triggered ***, 
  what the fuck is up with the graph ? 
  [ here 's a waaaaayyy better one . 
  please stop this . 
  italy already has a massive flag next to the uk . 
  and we barely reconquered this territory from / r/bitcoin . 
  we already agreed to having the eu flag instead of taking back our rightful place , so please leave this to / r/france . 
  everybody on / r/france and our discord server agrees that this is our rightful land . 
  we do n't mind helping the italians in the north west , but we wo n't let you replace us here . 
  nope nope nope . 
  stop this . 
  over at / r/france we 're taking our territory back , and then it will become european . 
  you may have misunderstood ( we need to revise the manifesto to make it clearer ) : what 's meant by nationalistic is n't the ukip/fn type : we want a strong and united self-sufficient europe . 
  nationalistic with the nation being europe , not each individual state . 
  this sub ( and the awesome people over on / r/acteuropa ) have made me feel more european than anything else . 
  i actually feel like we 're all part of the same country :d, 
  turns out this concerns a company called `` business france '' , that was employed by the ministry of economy . 
  it does n't concern emmanuel macron at all . 
  but i guess it would have made a less catchy title . 
  he 's absolutely right . 
  in a couple years , we 're going to end up with massive american , chinese , indian , and russian blocks , and some people really think eu countries are better off by themselves ? 
  the only way we can go forward is by sticking together . 
  not especially with a fully federal union , but with even tighter integration : european culture * is * a thing , and the only thing stopping us from dominating the world ( like in the good ol' days ) is the will to do so . 
  in fact , this is exactly what we 're trying to push for over on / r/acteuropa . 
  we want to move towards the eu that will be able to rivalise and influence the rest of the world . 
  we 're shit but the brits are worse , so that 's fine with me . 
  if they pull out , that gives a little more chance to paris 2024 . 
  it would be so unfair if la got them for the third time , and it would be beautifully symbolic if paris got them , exactly 100 years after the previous ones . 
  ^ plus , ^ it ^ would ^ force ^ the ^ town ^ to ^ renovate ^ the ^ fucking ^ rer ^ trains . 
  ^ sick ^ and ^ tired ^ of ^ the ^ state ^ of ^ those ^ bloody ^ trains , ^ considering ^ how ^ used ^ they ^ are . 
  no it is n't , but i see we are n't going to agree on this , so no need to keep arguing . 
  because it 's extremely taboo in france , and that chapter of history needs to be turned . 
  you realize those are n't incompatible ? 
  just how you can say that the shoah was a crime against humanity , but without hitler , the mess he made kickstarted the progress of the second half of the 20th century . 
   i think, 
  that article is shit . 
  basically , they 're being targeted by hundreds if not thousands of sql injection attempts and denial of service attacks every day , and are constantly being scrutinized for open communication ports or other security cracks . 
  all of these attacks can be traced to ukrainian ip addresses , on the russian border . 
  also , it 's pretty common knowledge russia wants le pen to win ( just go on rt or sputnik ) . 
  reports being attacked just after polls show macron as the most probable opponent to le pen on the second round . 
  sorry , but it does n't sound fake to me . 
  so try and be hopeful, 
  may 7th 2017, 
  but would n't there have to be a hard border no matter what if ever scotland becomes independent ? 
  no , not really . 
  trump had a 30 % chance of winning . 
  30 % = / = low . 
  and people say the french are pessimistic ... 
  absolutely , nothing is sure , however the situation ca n't be compared with the us , because of how differently the election works . 
  sorry , but no . 
  they 're bad , but completely unrealistic . 
  they do n't have any bullshit about getting out of the eu ( melenchon does , but just as a threat for renegotiation ) . 
  if you count the primaries , we 've got a four-round system . 
  he 's economically right-wing and socially left-wing/progressive . 
  except those morons will have to beat a two-round system . 
  and over 50 % of french people would vote for anyone instead of mlp . 
  that 's not an excuse . 
  you ca n't say `` others are n't all in so i wo n't until they do '' . 
  and tbh , it 's in scotland 's best interest . 
  in the current political situation , with the formation of isolated blocks like the u.s.a , russia , china , and india , it 's a lot less risky to fully join the e.u. 
  a fist is stronger than a hand-with-kind-of-stuck-together-fingers-but-not-really . 
  please do n't . 
  if it 's to take all the opt-outs , stay the fuck out . 
  the eu can only work if it 's members are full-in ; you ca n't pick and choose the advantages without any of the disadvantages . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  like most of / r/france, 
  do that and melenchon will win with 89 % of votes . 
  exactly . 
  the only other way for her to win is if she gets over 51 % in the first round , but all polls tell us that * over * 51 % of the population say they would `` never vote for her '' . 
  she may have a strong fan base , but she has an even larger hate base . 
  with the two-round system , her chances of winning are very slim ... too many people hate her . 
  there has already been the shitshow with the general de villiers , the confused national assembly , the lowering of the apl , and the media has talked about the labor reform quite a bit already . 
  basically . 
  i fell on a 24/7 beaufort vending machine once . 
  because they did n't have the choice . 
  the refusal right did n't exist . 
  it 's funny , because looking at your post history shows you are absolutely fucking obsessed with terrorism , muslims , and jihad , and all the fear mongering surrounding those subjects . 
  it also turns out that france is more than capable of securing an event like the olympics , just look at how well the euro 2016 went . 
  the dgse will have lots of time to make sure there are no problems . 
  oh and nice fucking disrespect on that last sentence of yours . 
  paris dealt with the euro 2016 just fine , which was a pretty massive event that was really well organised , without a single security issue . 
  i am . 
  it will force them to renovate the shit out of the metro and ( please please please ) do something about the rer b. 
   even more  q  u  o  t  e  s, 
   i feel, 
  how so ?? 
  that 's a completely fictional state of mankind , that never happened and whose concept is used as a thought experiment . 
  what does that change to the discussion ? 
  it 's a thought experiment , not fact , so you are defending the point of view that people are fundamentally good and would never murder each other in the ( fictional ) state of nature , without providing any evidence at all , despite their being some against you . 
  it talks about one skull , but that 's enough to counter your narrative of `` no violence at all '' . 
  if you say `` all chairs are blue '' , i just need to find a single red one to disprove your statement . 
  and if i find a single red one , i have strong evidence to support the idea that other non-blue ones must exist . 
  also can you prove to me that economy and property is n't `` natural '' , whatever the fuck that means ? 
  how is it not `` natural '' to want to keep stuff we make and exchange it against what we do n't have or ca n't do ? 
  and if neolithic was the beginning of these `` unnatural practices '' , does that mean homo sapiens is not natural ? 
  [ you 're welcome ] ( http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/wp-content/uploads/franchthicave.png ) oh , and btw , there have been [ crushed skulls ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/27/prehistoric-skull-puncture-wounds-murder-spain-neanderthal ) discovered in the neolithic area , showing that even if there were n't large scale wars , murder was still a thing . 
  all the prehistoric skulls that had been smashed by sharp objects ? 
  actually , the lights turn off whenever there 's an attack in france or a neighbouring country .
