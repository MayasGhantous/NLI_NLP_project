* as the french answers to that posts will show , we constantly disagree with each other . 
  * as this present answer shows , we like to be smug about being above other people 's behavior . 
  this time our maginot line will go up to calais !, 
  checkmate schleu friend !, 
  and we are everything they are not . 
  ok , i get the feeling you are not really trying to have a discussion and i get tired of repeating the point you decided to not get . 
  good bye good sir . 
  i am under the impression that red cross does not operate military radars or spy satellite and therefore made no statement about weteher or not russian vehicle crossed the border at a given time or what the point of origin of a missile was . 
  it took time to have independent confirmation of these and during these times , decisions and stances had to be made . 
  i am not talking about the spin over nazi insignia or political claims . 
  i am talking about giving an accurate and trustworthy depiction of the reality on the terrain . 
  i am talking about that because , being the cynical asshole that i am , in the us position i would use the horrible reputation that russia has right now to conduct false flag operations and come into this conflict quicker . 
  if i was given the precious advantage of an enemy that lies systematically i would start lying strategically . 
  and yes , we are on the democratic side , we do have a handicap : we do not want to be fed lies , even if they are smaller lies than what the other side feeds to its population . 
  this is the thing i am `` beyond naively '' moaning about . 
  i do n't want a repetition of the cold war where usa in many occurrences did behave pretty horribly . 
  a safety net against that is an objective and independent news agency . 
  no , there are no multiple sources . 
  we have russia and rebels usually saying one thing and us and kiev saying another . 
  one of them is lying and i am not comfortable judging truth based solely on someone 's reputation . 
  in cold-headed debate this is called ad-hominem argumentation and i would like to avoid relying on a fallacy when deciding if i should support a war . 
   most media just cares about making a buck on the western side . 
  which is exactly why i am proposing to create an international agency with a budget and a clear mission so that they can focus on something else than making a buck . 
  i have a problem when it comes to `` our word against their word '' in conflicts . 
  in several instances in the current conflict , journalist could not get any confirmation of either version of what was happening on the battlefield . 
  yes , because of the past i consider usa to have a higher reputation on this in a us-russia contradiction . 
  the thing is , usa is totally capable of lying to justify a military conflict . 
  i wish we had an independent way of checking the facts , especially when both sided seem to have an interest in a version or the other . 
  i am lamenting that usa is comfortable with a `` just trust us ! '', 
  mentality . 
  for instance , i wish `` free '' countries funded an independent intelligence agency which would focus on giving information on conflicts independently of national interests . 
  imagine a press agency with military grade recognition equipment and spy satellites . 
  even 1 % of nsa 's budget could fund that . 
  but i guess this is just a pipe dream . 
  at least that settles the ongoing dispute on the appartenance of nantes to the celtic world . 
  the king wo n't like it . 
  this is weird because finisterre is how we call the western tip of brittany here . 
  that means you have not followed what has been happening in georgia and chechnya . 
  putin is expansionist , smart , nationalist and skilled on the domestic politics . 
  he spent years consolidating his power , confiscating wealth , getting the reputation of a tough guy , impossible to remove from the top of the head . 
  the influential group of russian businessmen that led to the fall of ussr in 1991 are now very unpopular and are one side of a war for power in kremlin . 
  they lost the war in the last hours of 1999 . 
  do you remember the weirdness of the accession to power of putin ? 
  i think it is still unexplained as of today : on 31th of december 1999 , while everyone was waiting for the y2k bug to make the world end , yeltsin suddenly announced his resignation and announced that his prime minister , the then-widely-unknown-and-unremarkable putin , would replace him . 
  what now becomes clearer is that this was a fight for power between the wealthy class and the military/kgb faction . 
  on 31th of december 1999 , the era of the `` chicago boys '' ended . 
  the old protectors of the ussr stepped back in power , on the top of a disintegrated block . 
  despite a war on a part of the wealthy class , putin is not a communist at all . 
  he understood that people in russia did not consider this ideology very dearly anymore . 
  so in order to strengthen the national sentiment he bet on religion , military pride and ( apparently ) a russian taste for `` strong men '' figures . 
  ussr 2.0 is coming back . 
  it wo n't pretend to be communist , at least not as long as there will be russian-speaking territories left to invade . 
  after that , it will have to find a new ideology to justify expansion , my bet is religion , but it will confuse politicians for a while : putin is pretty much a far-right leader focusing on nationalism and authoritarianism . 
  seeing him use old style soviet memes and red flags may delay this understanding . 
  you were the one starting to compare usa and russia and assume that i would criticize usa only because i am supporting russia . 
  so apply that to yourself man . 
  i only started by pointing out that we have to trust unreliable usa 's word here . 
  i never suggested russia was more trustworthy . 
  not a fan of russian humor i see ? 
  og = olympic games my point is that usa should not consider itself moral just because it is more moral than russia . 
  this is a very low standard . 
  so yes , russia is lying a lot . 
  this is not a good excuse for usa to lie a bit . 
   what exactly is usa lying about with nsa or assange ? 
  `` we do n't spy civilian '' `` it is only for national security matters '' because , you know , merkel is a terrorist . 
   assange pretending that they had nothing to do with extradition and uk threatening to storm an embassy is just laughable . 
   are you under the impression that france does n't spy ? 
  france spies and that is shameful as well . 
  france lies as well . 
  is that a good reason for us to lie to the population it wants to convince ? 
  is that supposed to raise my trust in usa ? 
  and in case you may have missed it : no , i do n't support russia . 
  i have been calling putin a dictator for years and told that making the og , the football cup in russia or making military deals with him was stupid as hell . 
  i support the western side . 
  and that does n't mean i wo n't call them when they are doing shitty things . 
  you may be ok with `` slightly better than russia '' but i have a higher standard for the country i want to live in and the countries i want it to ally with . 
  i bow before this superior argumentation . 
  with that logic , any private effort is state-sanctioned . 
  but we know that us lies : on iraq , on assange , on nsa . 
  so yeah , i 'll side with this tribe , but my opinion has to rely on usa 's word , which has been shown to be unreliable . 
  i personally would not bet my life on that . 
  lagarde could work . 
  i personally would never vote for anyone who was part of sarkozy 's team , especially not the artisan of the tapie deal , but i could see how she could gather a lot of right wing votes . 
  i say we need a referendum for this one because it is an ** important ** part of sovereignty . 
  i do n't care that we decide to only use one kind of bullet for interoperability of that we agree to fish an amount of tuna decided by a committee . 
  however , when it is a treaty with the potential to prevent ** a lot ** of laws in ** every ** field of economy , that it is secret and that it makes it costly to withdraw from it ( as opposed to nato for instance , where dropping in or out was pretty easy ) then yes , the people needs to be consulted . 
  there was a referendum to join the ec in the 70 's . 
  rules on citizenship and movement of people were determined later ( from the french perspective ) . 
  you may have missed this one : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_maastricht_treaty_referendum,_1992  first , all of your past ftas have been `` secret '' at the negotiating stage . 
  yep , and that 's bad , especially when they are designed so that once the negotiation phase is over , there is no public debate and it needs to be accepted quickly despite often blatant corruption during the negociation . 
  hopefully , since acta , people have started to understand and refuse the maeuver . 
  i do n't understand how you go from being opposed to this treaty to be opposed to every treaty . 
   hell , as a european you 've lost the right to close your borders or restrict citizenship . 
  here 's a funny thing : we voted about that one . 
   it 's not like there 's a provision where the military shows up if you try to quit . 
  heh , i ca n't even be sure of that . 
  the text is secret . 
  and there may not be military threats , but the kind of economic sanction it proposes is probably close to that . 
  see what 's happening to argentina nowadays . 
   switzerland is n't in the eu ... yep , my bad , europe .
