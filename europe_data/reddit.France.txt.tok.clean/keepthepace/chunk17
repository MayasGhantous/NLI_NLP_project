  de gaulle was met with protests in his last years but before that and after that , even today , he is a quite consensual figure in the french politics and his contributions recognized and acknowledged from far-left to far-right . 
  saying to a politican that he is gaullist will be seen as a compliment by almost everyone . 
  what happened was that he was president during may 68 . 
  you may have heard of it , it was our riot-month in our hippie year . 
  students making barricades in paris , calling for the revolution , anarchists bringing back memories of the parisian commune . 
  quite a good time ... now de gaulle was a symbol of conservatism : a military leader , former fighter in both world wars , strict catholic , in favor of moral conservatism , death penalty , strong opponent to communists , and so on . 
  the young generation had grown with only de gaulle as a leader . 
  they wanted to try something else . 
  yet , he was not disliked by the majority , even at this time . 
  he did what a courageous leader does in front of riots : he dissolved the parliament , and called for new elections , implicitly ( or explicitly ? 
  i do n't remember ) saying he would resign without a majority . 
  he got a strong one . 
  ( 60/40 ) he then re-established order , as he could call the revolutionaries wannabes illegitimate and anti-democratic , and a year later he made a referendum on a constitutional reform , that was actually understood as a referendum about him as a president . 
  he lost 52/48 so he resigned , something he was not constitutionally forced to do . 
  `` politics is like sausages : you do n't want to know how it is made '' -- bismarck [ ghost division ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjzs4wzr8dm ) is a song i like by sabaton about rommel 's division during the invasion of france . 
  he probably was rutheless and a bit dangerous for his own side , but it turns out that the french forces were far more incompetent than most german militaries thought , so in the end , rommel 's carelessness was right . 
  it is hard to judge after the fact . 
  he was later fighting in africa and was nicknamed the `` desert fox '' by his enemies . 
  patton called this part of the war , a `` war without hate '' , which is quite noteworthy for wwii . 
  he decided to disregard his orders to execute jewish prisoners of war , which did require bravery , considering it was explicitly said to be treason to not obey them . 
  epic hero ? 
  that 's a tough one . 
  we have a lot of good leaders , and some with nice lore around them but someone who was provably epic ? 
  well , here are some anecdotes : ** surcouf ** , a privateer , attacked a ship whose crew was 4x to 5x more numerous than his ( initially it could have been a mistake ) but through leadership , deception to his crew ( he said they were only outnumbered 1 to 2 so `` every one kills his two englishmen and we win '' ) and by setting a fire on his own ship , and making it clear there was no way back , he got his crew to win . 
  ** cyrano de bergerac ** was a real person , and surprisingly similar to the novel 's character . 
  he fought in the war , and came back a pacifist ( he is the inventor of the expression `` citizen of the world '' ) . 
  his ideas were so unconventional and heretical that he attracted many enemies , but he kept them in check as he was a master fencer . 
  in one famous letter he complains about the quality of the assassins that were sent to him and gives advices to the enemy he suspected sent them ( `` sometimes you have to pay a bit for quality '' ) . 
  there really was a rumor saying he ( and a few friends ) confronted 100 assassins to defend one of his friends . 
  it is probably a huge exaggeration . 
  i consider ** charles de gaulle ** and ** napoleon ** to be impressive figures , but there are not much epic anecdotes around them . 
  both apparently were calm after assassination attempts , but this is maybe not what we are looking for . 
  edit : ah , yes , about nerves of steel ( or downright inconscience ) , there was this one with de gaulle and the general massu , who was the commander of the french forces in germany during the cold war . 
  in the 60s , the berlin wall starts to exist . 
  at first it was , one night , just a ribbon of barbed wires the east soldiers laid down . 
  french soldiers saw that and reported it immediately . 
  it is not clear if the order is from de gaulle or massu , but it was `` ok , they want to play ? 
  do that : order some tanks to come and roll down on these barbed wires . 
  let 's see how they react to that . '', 
  well , they reacted to that by calling the us forces and telling them to force their fucking allies to stop playing with matches . 
  on one occasion , de gaulle stated that stalin was the person he knew with the biggest sense of humor . 
  i guess his successor did not follow the tradition ... 
  in french , we do call it the battle of poitiers ( and if you click to the link to the french wikipedia in the battle of tours you will see that ) the one you are talking about was an english victory , therefore it did never happen . 
  charles martel fought against the first caliphate 's expansionism , in 732 . 
  vlad fought the ottoman empire in the 15th century . 
  there were , like , 10 crusades in between . 
  it is not like christianity and the muslim world did fight only once . 
  i had the feeling that partouze and orgie were synonymous , and indeed more or less balanced in number of men/women but i must confess i am not very knowledgeable of the specifics . 
  you say it like it is a bad thing ... 
  we also use `` orgie '' if you want a more classical term . 
  gals were not mentioned . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  to be honest , i doubt that they even are capable of that anymore . 
  yet it seemed the german pp was more capable than the french one ... 
  well , their initial strategy was to be worth a few percents to show big parties how worthy it is to take their geeky suggestions and integrate it into their own program . 
  they were not really planning to get elected . 
  unfortunately , in france at least , they have become a more or less left-wing party ( between the greens and the far-left ) , which is far more useless if you ask me ... 
  i do n't know if the german pp did the same . 
  which one ? 
   and web blocking circumvention tools . 
  which also means the eff , the fsf , and i am guessing , the local pirate party website as well ? 
  i am not sure this is constitutional , and if the uk accepted the european declaration on human rights , this may very well be contrary to the principles of political freedom . 
  somehow i am relieved . 
  this regulation is becoming too silly to ever be really implemented . 
  vote pirate party ? 
  edit : or , actually , any non-major party ? 
  this happened in greece : the two major parties imploded , opening the way to the far left ( which is # 1 now ) . 
  but you will only hear fear mongering about golden dawn in the media ( they went from 3 % to 7 !, 
  that 's why we riot frequently in france , with encouragement from the older generation . 
  you got ta keep this traditional know-how running . 
  well the thing is , historical buildings require maintenance and care to be preserved . 
  keep a handful of bunkers from wwii , in prime condition , but demolish the ones that litter the beaches . 
  i was giving , for different opinions , the possible explanations they would give for a market failure . 
  of course a free market enthusiast does ` nt like a government regulating the spectrum !, 
  and says this is the root cause of the problem . 
  i think it is partly true , but that the solution is not in removing this governmental intervention . 
  have you read the last two paragraphs of my post ? 
  it answers your proposal . 
  you can let the situation evolve , but you would end up with an authority pretty much like the government , with probably far less independence . 
  more precisely , it is a scheme to not call it restructuring of debt . 
  it allows to allow greece to somehow default without calling that a default . 
  you have several ways to look at it , depending a lot on your political opinions . 
  free market enthusiast : the government sells spectrum portions at a very high price , making the price of entry so high that only 2 to 4 groups can usually afford this . 
  free market critic and information theorist : when prices are at a level that is very far above marginal costs , players easily reach a nash equilibrium where the rational players understand that engaging a price competition is in no one 's interest and that no increase of share can offset the costs of lowering the margin . 
  this does not necessarily require an illicit agreement on price fixing , but can happen spontaneously ( though illicit agreement do happen and can be impossible to prove ) i personally tend to disagree with 1 . because the government in this case ensures things that have been proven to not happen in a free it market : interoperability and extended coverage . 
  having no governmental regulation in this field would mean letting the spectrum being a jungle : expect jamming , frequencies stolen between operators and an increase in rf pollution . 
  such a mess , when allowed to happen , usually result in the emergence of an overseeing authority , very similar to what governments do today . 
  in this case , regulation is a shortcut toward the free-market solution that would emerge . 
  the very nature of cellular networks makes it impossible for the conditions of free competition to appear , therefore , you ca n't assume that problems will solve by themselves . 
  i still would love a shared election where every eu citizen would have to vote on the same candidates . 
  even with little power , a eu presidential election would be an incredible boost for eu identity . 
  remember : if it costs more than a local cellphone connexion + a skype call , someone is stealing from you . 
  seriously . 
  people know that internet makes it basically free to send a few kilobytes to the other side of the planet . 
  how can we still accept `` roaming costs '' that are several times the cost of a regular cellphone connexion ? 
  what costs money is the connexion to the cellphone antenna . 
  hell , if i am calling a landline on another continent i should pay half than for calling another cellphone in the same country !, 
  a sane roaming rate is zero . 
  i agree that acta had a big impact . 
  actually , i would be interested in a sociology study of this .
