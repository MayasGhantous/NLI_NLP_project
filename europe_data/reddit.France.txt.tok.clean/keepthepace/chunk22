  echelon was made over what remains from intelligence gathering stations created during the cold war . 
  nato was the main bloc opposing ussr , and it was an exclusively us command . 
  i am not sure that uk was on board with echelon , but they have already been much closer to usa than the rest of europe ( sometimes it feel like the channel is bigger than the atlantic ocean ) yes , this is a `` complot '' ( a conspiracy ) , assange had a very nice essay on conspiracies in the modern world and how to make them harder through transparency . 
  however , the us probably has the power to have the widest spying network , but do not underestimate other surveillance networks . 
  i know we have a small one ( google `` frenchelon '' for more information ) but also china probably has a very nice one . 
  their hardware is everywhere , in every strategical network facility . 
  their security is ( voluntarily ? ), 
  so weak that it is easy to enter in many places . 
  and the budget of their surveillance agency is probably comparable to nsa 's , though it is probably symmetric in its interest : they mainly spy on chinese citizens , but not the other way around . 
  ussr has a lot of competent security expert , so you can assume they also intercept all the communications they can . 
  the thing is , the task is much easier for usa as it is home of the company we feed our data too : facebook , google , microsoft , apple , amazon ( who ousted wikileaks and now hosts ... 
  ) , etc. . . nsa just has to knock at their door . 
  they have to collaborate and they ca n't even tell about it . 
  for those of you who thought us was not crazy enough . 
  exactly . 
  thanks for the reference . 
  most meps were alive in 2001 . 
  most were into politics . 
  what is this new epidemic of mass amnesia ? 
  i have the very distinct feeling that we are being mocked by our hypocritical elites . 
  actually , i hope it is the case , otherwise it means the eu is managed by people with no memory and a very short attention span . 
   thank you europe . 
  we will do our best to earn our place among you . 
  if you really mean it , you should quickly adopt the transnational sport of complaining about eu . 
  the wikipedia has 3 sources estimating the budget to be around 10 billions in 2007 . 
  i made what i consider conservative estimates to say it has grown by 50 % in 2013 ( it intelligence contracts are really raining in the industry right now and have seen a huge growth these last years and the whole cyberwar doctrine has been elaborated since then ), 
  it is like journalists discover what echelon is . 
  the real shock for me is not the extent to which people are spied on by us , it is the vastness of the ignorance of ** publicly available and authenticated data ** !, 
  i mean echelon triggered warning from the eu when boeing got access to emails from airbus . 
  it triggered a change on cryptography laws . 
  during the wikileaks debacle , they got all the information they wanted including the twitter private informations from an iceland mep , who tried to make some legitimate ruckus about it but it was widely ignored . 
  of course , yes , the us spies on you !, 
  why do you think they passed laws to legalize exactly that ? 
  what do you think the nsa does with his budget that equals nasa 's ? 
  their explicit , legal , official mission is to have a file on you . 
  seriously , what did people expect ? 
  does your isp provide an email address ? 
  otherwise , do something that most people shudder to think about : pay for the service . 
  choose a provider located outside us and pay 5 $ per year ... 
  remember , if you are not paying , you are not the client , you are the product ... 
  actually , even in non life-threatening situation , we overreact inside of a car . 
  i have seen an interesting explanation once . 
  be careful that this may be bogus science though : in a car , we are seated , comfortably , warm and in control . 
  there is some air circulation , but far less than outside . 
  you smell your own odor ( which is unconscious but the brain has this information ) . 
  a part of the brain then deduces that you are inside your territory , your safe home , possibly with some people you love and want to protect . 
  but then you have to interact with other people , and you do know that this can be a question of security . 
  a douchebag on the road can be a life-threatening danger . 
  the combination of both gives your animal brain the `` aggression-at-home '' signal : your home 's security has been breached . 
  get all your teeth and fangs out , shout and hiss , this is your last stand for you and your family . 
  it takes some willpower to resist that sentiment . 
  this may be purely confirmation bias , but i do believe that i now manage to spot my brain reaction to my own smell and to the feeling of security that follows . 
  yeah , shocking , but what is the alternative ? 
  be very careful about that . 
  the european parliament 's most important characteristic is its independence . 
  i would like that an administration inspects the finances of individual meps but i would then fear a lot that this administration tries to coerce votes . 
  meps can be lazy and get a huge pay for nothing . 
  considering that they have to face corruption , this is a ** good ** thing . 
  if they do n't have to work and still can make a living , then the worst that a lazy person co do is that they take some free money . 
  the alternative is that the lazy person accepts corruption and only gets to vote for the laws it is paid for . 
  show this video again when the guy will try to be reelected , that 's all we can do and that is all that should be necessary . 
  if this guy is re-elected , well , his electors deserve him . 
   it does not appear that he asks for the interview to be ended before becoming aggressive . 
  there are several cuts and i would be very surprised he did not ask the reporter to leave him alone . 
  what the reporter is doing is actually called harassment . 
  the correct journalist practice is to stop the interview at request and conclude `` he did not want to comment . '', 
  he wanted to be assaulted and was actually fairly happy and ready when it began . 
  i think that the mp is despicable in the practice shown , but the journalist is a total douche . 
  i know that many consider a lot of his analysis outdated , but i have never heard anyone claim it makes erroneous quote ? 
  yeah , well as a french , i thought that the gauls , incapable of agreeing on anything and discussing any decision without any kind of discipline , was spot on . 
  it was a quote in the `` rise and fall of the roman empire '' by gibbons . 
  it would be hard to find back the exact quote and i would not want to put it on a forum not not create flames on the opinions about jews , but let 's just stay that it was a typical stereotype that you still hear today . 
  once again , makes everyone wish they lived in scandinavia . 
  since i have read a 2000 years old roman commentary that criticized the various nations forming the roman empire with stereotypes that we still use today , i wonder if such things ever change . 
  i think the q&a session sucked and the journalist did his job poorly . 
  anyone with a clue just had confirmations of what was already highly suspected . 
  the one part where we could have actually learned interesting information was on the technical side , on how things were actually done . 
  i 'll copy the part that talks about it in the q&a and that personally put me in a state of furor :  a master on computers , he seemed happiest when talking about the technical side of surveillance , at a level of detail comprehensible probably only to fellow communication specialists . 
  fuck this journalist . 
  if you do n't understand what he said , at least repeat it !, 
  and when you have the unique historic chance to interview an nsa it specialist , you go there with another it specialist to understand the details . 
  i want to know how nsa technically spies on us . 
  it is crucial for the tor project for instance . 
  have they broken rsa ? 
  the latest ssl ? 
  are they injecting dns certificate ( they probably are but having a confirmation would be nice ) . 
  what about the windows nsa key ? 
  you got an it guy !, 
  ask him it questions !, 
  in germany they have the ccc . 
  support your local internet freedom groups . 
  support your hackerspaces ( there are great ones in netherlands ) . 
  why is this a question ? 
  stuxxnet is not exactly recent news . 
  yes it has , it admits it , it is proud of it . 
  what is the question , exactly ? 
  did you mean equality instead of inequality ? 
  because of my political ideas , i liked this explanation first , but it doesn not match the facts : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_h6xw_a4tyus/sedcyotkxhi/aaaaaaaaam4/fbhxdw3g9mc/s1600-h/europe+inequality+map.bmp it explains scandinavia vs the rest , but then you should have inverted values between france and uk , portugal and spain , baltic states vs europe . 
  switzerland and italy also are a strong contrast ... 
  `` police partout , justice nulle part '' ( police everywhere , justice nowhere ) french saying .
