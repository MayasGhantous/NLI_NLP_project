  clean it a bit and restore stations and you could have a new transport ring in the middle of the city . 
  of course , people living close to it do not want trains under their windows . 
  other people would love to turn that into a green walkway ( hence removing the rails ) . 
  other people love that this is actually a good forbidden spot and fear that if it becomes public the access to the catacombs will become harder to get . 
  basically , it is paris : people love to argue , they have been discussing for decades and nothing gets done . 
  a long time ago , i predicted that a russian aggression would be the trigger for the creation of a european army . 
  let putin do his tap dance and let us senate be embarassed at it , and the nato can become irrelevant overnight in europe . 
  we do need protection from nato . 
  if it ca n't offer that because if a deficient us commandment , it wo n't be hard to replace the nato command with a eu command and move all the nato forces into this new structure . 
  funny that in english they use the french translation , as in france we usually use the german-aslsacien word `` flammekueche '', 
  that 's how you are supposed to dispose of french flag : fried in a pan then eaten with a bourgogne wine a few degrees below room temperature . 
  no one calls alsace this way . 
  i still do n't understand why wwii was not between our two empires . 
  i do n't know enough to claim that this is the solution , and honestly have no idea about it , but i am simply asking why / u/lolkac seems to say that central bank ca n't offer a 0 % rate for a sustained period ? 
  i am talking about inflation because i think this is what / u/lolkac 's question is about : can the bce lend money at 0 % rate when inflation becomes bigger ? 
  well , this is irrelevant because this is probably the bce 's objective . 
  considering that debt reduction is more important than keynesian stimulus . 
  [ it indeed worked beautifully for uk ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/total-unemployment-2007-present.png ), 
  [ no ] ( http://econbrowser.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/consolidation_growth.png ) the correlation between reduced budget and economic growth is negative . 
  you can argue that the causality is the opposite of what keynesians say but then you need to explain why the upper right corner of the graph , where austerity success stories live , looks so empty . 
  uk would probably keep most of its current trade agreement with eu so economy-wise , the impact would close to zero . 
  uk is not part of euro or the schengen zone so i am not sure much things will change . 
  the only thing that will change is that uk does not have political power anymore in the decisions over eu organizations it usually opts out of . 
  what mechanism do you see would have an impact on uk economy if they leave ? 
  that 's always a matter of betting on consistent policies and trusting the bce 's persistence , but why ca n't the bce lend money at a 0 % rate until inflation becomes a bit more decent ? 
  yeah , well please hide this map and the logic behind it . 
  i do n't want germany to get any ideas over alsace . 
  [ oh , and if it is fair to ask to come back to historical borders , i choose 1939 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/french_empire_1919-1939.png ), 
  sounds weird he did not talk about this with poland first ... 
  i had read that in a while but re-reading it you are right , i probably overestimate the anount of interpretation that it leaves room to . 
  yet , it will be an interesting time if a `` small '' nato member with a more or less crazy leadership gets attacked . 
  and who decides what constitutes an attack ? 
  poland ? 
  or the high commandment of nato ? 
  i highly doubt that 100 % of nato member would trust either of these enough to declare a war on russia . 
  the wording is important . 
  if poland gets attacked , nato will not tell anyone in germany to move troops to help . 
  it can do so if ** it is deemed necessary ** by germany . 
  if germany says `` we sent poland two ambulances to help '' , germany fulfilled its obligations with regards to nato . 
  of course , the spirit of the alliance is that germany ( and every nato member ) should immediately declare war in case of aggression but this has never been tested so far and most of nato 's operations have been wars where only a part of the members accepted ( usually reluctantly ) to participate . 
  will the us step in to declare war to russia and start wwiii if russian tanks cross the polish border and putin says `` woopsie , my mistake , i 'll pull them out . 
  by the way i declare an unilateral cease-fire and would like to discuss that at un . 
  what says you ? '', 
  you win two internets sir . 
  i do n't think this could happen without collaboration from us and nato . 
  obviously , a eu army would join nato but the transition period would require synchronization . 
  which song ? 
  and are you sure it is not already happening ? 
  it took us one year to have confirmation that france was helping syrian rebels with weapons . 
  i would not be surprised if a lot of equipment and personnel was not already helping the ukrainian army . 
  well , we should build a eu army quick then . 
   it 's really nice to see there are governments which does n't want to harm us - unlike our own . 
  do n't misunderstand them . 
  they do not at this way for humanitarian reasons , but because they think it is more effective to target things that annoy the decision makers rather than the general public . 
   putin & co already created self-inflicted food embargo , in the next month they are going to forbid import of drugs . 
  i saw that claim on reddit before already . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  it seems an incredibly stupid thing to do for russia , i have a hard time believing it seriously considers that . 
   also , if those separatists attack poland , i guess that would mean nato will be obliged to get involved . 
  actually , if a nato country gets attacked by russia , what will happen is that we will get to finally know what it means . 
  there are no laws that say that other nato have to retaliate or consider that an attack . 
  the only thing that the pact of nato says is that if a nato members is attacked , any other nato member * is allowed * to consider this an attack on itself and to retaliate * if it wants to * . 
  basically , it means that if poland is attacked by russia and as a result germany sends troops on russian territory , all nato members will consider this legitimate and wo n't tell that germany attacked russia unprovoked . 
  right now , putin is using the strategy of pretending ( and that may even be right to some point ) that he dose not control most of the forces fighting in ukraine now . 
  so he can easily separate from the unit that would take the blame . 
  or it may be that the american ones are pretty bad actually . 
  well , some of the equipment they stole from ukrainian army . 
  i would not be surprised if some rebels were eserters from the ukrainian army and took some equipment with them . 
  after all , the whole crimean navy declared it allegiance to moscow , it can happen in some armored units too . 
  ah , i read too quickly , my bad . 
  i see people mentioning the rate of rubble vs euro but in no graph i could see it seemed radically affected . 
  did i miss something ? 
  finally !, 
  our secret intimidation weapon has proven effective !, 
  russia has undergone more revolutions and regime change than canada did . 
  hell , you still officially have a queen !, 
  you just were lucky to live in a monarchy without either you or your ancestors having to fight , the monarchs were kind of decent . 
  be careful , according to putin this means you have a strong desire to join russia . 
   and what would he need it for ? 
  money is buying control . 
  when the shit hits the fan and someone decides he wants putin 's seat , vladimir will need every million to buy military loyalties . 
  it looks strange to all of us . 
  i gave two suggestion , lower , but belgians say i recommended two unremarkable ones : i love the grimbergen ambr\u00e9e and the leffe triple . 
  their blonde counterpart are rather bland but these are , in my opinion , pretty good . 
  i also love the hercules stout ( i usually do n't like black beers ) but it is a bit harder to find . 
  yes well i must say that when a belgian made me taste `` good belgian beers '' i found these pretty bland . 
  i never could find a difference between the different pilsners and the light lagers have very similar tastes . 
  but you do also produce different beers . 
  here is my favorite and the thing that i miss almost as much as cheese here in japan : [ grimbergen ambr\u00e9e ] ( http://www.grimbergen.fr/upload/slides-packages/4/url_picture/ambree.png ) i wo n't say no to a leffe triple either . 
  on brussels , nonetheless , like a true european . 
  but face it : you are the country with the best beer period . 
  a pissing kid is just a natural symbol of that . 
  it happens regularly : the sacr\u00e9 coeur was built at the place from which the [ parisian commune ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_commune ) started , and was later bloodily suppressed . 
  this basilica ( it is not a cathedral , the cathedral is where the bishop is and paris ' is notre dame ) was built to prevent the place to become a memorial to this popular uprising . 
  even today , the place is considered to be left and marxist leaning . 
  on the uprising birthday , it is common to see [ graffitis commemorating this uncelebrated event ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/userdata/images/1395247111_sacre.coeur.afp.jpg ),

  for those who wonder about the mont blanc being labeled france/italy , this is actually a reminiscent but never resolved border dispute between these two countries . 
  france considers it owns it all and italy considers it owns half .
