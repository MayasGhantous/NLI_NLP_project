  putin seems to be a generator of troubles . 
  funny thing is , after the night of the long knives , hitler was perceived as the moderate who cleaned up the most radicals out of his party . 
  he was actually praised for that by other european nations . 
  iirc before the war churchill actually wanted hitler as an ally as in his eyes ussr was a much bigger threat than nazi germany was . 
  how so ? 
  tunisia is now a democracy , egypt is back at the starting point and it is too early to say what libya will emerge as . 
  revolutions are random process . 
  i see it like the roll of a die where only one side says `` democracy '' . 
  it took my country 3 revolutions ( 1789 , 1830 and 1848 ) to achieve democracy . 
  you can even count 5 if you take a more lax definition ( add 1792 and 1871 ) . 
  the thing is , apart from this random process , we do n't know how to replace dictators with a republic . 
  we are not even sure if we can help this process unfold favorably ( i personally believe that all it takes is to honestly pick the most democratic side and help it win and i wish we did it in syria and iraq ) . 
  so favor revolutions . 
  they do n't often lead to improvements but they rarely make matters much worse . 
  she is right . 
  crimea is eu 's bargaining chip and we are in no condition to let it go yet . 
  do n't let people believe that this * de facto * annexation has been accepted . 
  at one point the deal will end up being `` leave the rest of ukraine alone , recognize its government and we will recognize crimea as a russian territory . '', 
  even that will be a net win for putin . 
  but do like the russians do : play hardball , stand by your doctrine . 
  otherwise , in this field , pragmatism combined with pacifism would look like weakness . 
  crimea annexation was illegal and still will be in 10 , 20 , 50 years and shows that russia does not desire to be a partner for peace and cooperation . 
  as long as this situation continues , softening the stance will be a weakness . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  a country recognition comes from a national will to recognize said country as an entity you can have diplomatic relationships with . 
  you can totally send military forces in help of a group without recognizing their diplomatic claims . 
  for instance several countries are helping the peshmergas ( kurd fighters ) to fight isis without these countries recognizing kurdistan . 
  so eu or not , a military help is not an automatic recognition . 
  you would expect it to be in most cases , but there are exceptions and the example you propose would be one . 
  note that there are already [ eu battlegroupes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) operational today , and that eufor has already been deployed in some cases . 
  granted , its current size makes it only suitable for small scale operation but the organization is there as well as the structure of command . 
  if it needs to grow , all that is missing is political will . 
  and for political will to exist , we have to cease using consensus as the main method of taking decisions . 
   by sending spanish forces to protect kosovo , they would unintentionally recognise kosovo right ? 
  which is why they would send european forces , not spanish ones . 
  let 's start with quebec . 
  putin will appear with an iron mask welded to his face and he will announce that russia shall now be known as latveria . 
  fighting a bear bare-chested and barehanded . 
  everybody freeze !, 
  despite the understandable emotion it may cause in serbia , this is pretty regular crime and not a big event . 
  i do n't think we expect a comment from serbia every time a serbian commits a crime in france . 
  why should the opposite be true ? 
  i 'd love another source than nypost on that . 
  they are not bright enough ? 
  and russia has a history of rewriting reality through propaganda . 
  ok my bet : i doubt putin could go down without more fuss . 
  if it is a coup , it is an internal one led by putin to displace some people . 
  there were rumors saying that he is not controlling the pro-russian faction in ukraine and that they decided to kill nemtsov without putin knowledge . 
  i would bet on him putting order in his ranks and announcing a change of strategy in ukraine . 
  there is cause to believe that since the death of his wife he was actively hating humanity . 
  it is a wonder really that nuclear war did not happen . 
  if tsipras died now , i think it would cause a pretty huge uproar . 
  religion . 
  still a leading provider of social values in a lot of places in the world . 
  translation : - on the matter of [ personal ] data , europe ** must ** talk through a single voice . 
  - this single voice will be translated in 17 languages . 
  people here seem to say that it has been differently applied in the different countries of the eu . 
  you can find some numbers for 2010-2014 here : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lectricit%c3%a9_en_france you wo n't see any clear drop as electricity consumption at the level of a country depends a lot on economics and weather . 
  a slightly colder winter may totally offset any gains . 
  knowing that , it may be noteworthy that residential electricity use seem to have almost stopped its growth between 2013 and 2014 but again it could be totally unrelated . 
  because energy saving is a matter of gaining percent after percent . 
  a bit more efficient lights , a bit more insulated homes , a bit less demanding acs and washing machines . 
  each of these just shave off percents of the total but they end up having an overall effect . 
  what if i disagree about marriage in general ? 
  shower thought : the us must now feeling about russia 's influence the way we have ever felt about us influence in europe . 
  that france is a hoax , probably shot in a studio of new jersey . 
  they have the adress and have doxxed half of the video team . 
  it is actually the [ last frame ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqu_zylgxou ) . 
  trump opened it first . 
  like this article point out , switzerland works out fine . 
  it has one of the best health and education system in europe and has such a low tax rate that it is considered like a local tax haven . 
  this actually does not happen because of direct referendums but because politicians learning to avoid them . 
  they anticipate what the demands will be and arrange to pass laws that will satisfy enough people for the referendum to fail . 
  californians wanted lower taxes . 
  well , this may be dumb but that may be also a sensible idea . 
  the thing is it will be catastrophic if the elected people do n't understand that their policy has to adapt to the will of the people . 
  lower taxes means lower services . 
  that 's what is asked , the govt has to obey . 
  i do n't think that direct democracy is doomed to lead to more catastrophic decision than representative democracy . 
  why ? 
  people who vote like morons on laws are likely ti vote like morons on candidates . 
  it works fine in switzerland . 
  i would argue that the problem could be with voters , not the system, 
  this kind of jokes exist almost everywhere . 
  `` gather a million signature and we will give you a date at which we will ignore it officially . '', 
  i do n't need that : any petition gathering one million signature will attract politicians ' attention . 
  but something that would actually be forcing them to make a law ? 
  they want to avoid it and have no good democratic reason for that . 
  in switzeralnd , 50 000 signatures on a petition cause a referendum . 
  a yes at the referendum makes a new law . 
  any nation that can not handle it can not handle democracy . 
  if you ca n't choose what want the laws to be , why should you be allowed to choose a candidate based on the laws s/he promises to make ? 
  switzerland 's `` votation '' system : a petition signed by 1 % of the population causes a referendum . 
  a ` yes ' at the referendum makes the petition text a law . 
  michel rocard made an opinion piece in the french journal le monde , that can be found here : http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2014/06/05/amis-anglais-sortez-de-l-union-europeenne-mais-ne-la-faites-pas-mourir_4431399_3232.html apparently it was summed up by `` uk gtfo lol u sux '' in some medias , so i made a translation of what i believe is a not too long but well-thought summary of the current core problems of europe and how uk are making them worse . 
  this is a frank opinion by a retired politician . 
  it is indeed frank but it is not the senseless bashing that it is reported as . 
  please excuse the grammar errors , weird sentence structures and occasional slip into american english . 
  ----- ** english friends , leave the european union but do n't kill it ** there is between you and us , the continental europeans , a misunderstanding that is turning for the worst . 
  your immense history causes around you an admiration that is sometimes limitless .
