  saying that you protect a culture by freezing it is like saying that you keep things alive by putting them in formol . 
  she is not an immigrant . 
  she is an icelandic citizen . 
  like her mother . 
  it is a common feature of democracies that citizens of the country are allowed to protest the laws they find stupid . 
  the last time boatpeople from iceland came to france , it did not turn out very well . 
  i say if they ask for passports , we give them passports . 
  that 's what pierre de coubertin tried to achieve . 
  that 's one of the reason why football ( the real one , that americans insist on calling soccer ) gets that much funds . 
  channeling mindless nationalism in an harmless way . 
  so what , exactly , constitutes a terrorist activity ? 
  taking arms in any foreign fights ? 
  taking arms in a fight against bachar al-assad ? 
  taking arms as part of a muslim group ? 
  of a religious-oriented group ? 
  judge them if you will , but refusing an entry on face value without having specific facts to reproach to a person is exactly what a democracy should not be doing : arbitrary rulings . 
  there are a of of people in european countries who think we should have or should be fighting al-assad directly . 
  it is a perfectly legal opinion and a pretty popular one . 
  outlawing people who do what so many urge to do seems a bit hypocritical to me . 
  i think that uk has the good sense to arrest people preparing bombs on their territories . 
  that wo n't work because of the [ bullshit assymetry law ] ( http://38.media.tumblr.com/274447f0c11cae30d73a389985c753bc/tumblr_n6ddlvrfgg1qz4fjzo1_1280.jpg ), 
  thing is , the situation is probably like in / r/france where far-right commentators admitted to have multiple accounts and multiply voting . 
  as it is done , the voting system on reddit is ** very crude ** and does not prevent [ sybil attacks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sybil_attack ) . 
  you have two solutions to that problem : - recreate reddit from scratch with strong crypto and indentity checks - stop regard the score of comments like and agree/disagree vote . 
  this is the main reason i hate the recent decision of reddit to hide down/up votes : most of my pro-immigration contributions are scored between -1 and 1 , but that is sometime because they are uninteresting and sometime because i have 20 downvotes and 20 upvotes . 
  i would like to be able to tell the difference . 
  that 's how they finnish every discussion . 
  you need to put more words and logic into it . 
  yes , they may be seeding thoughtcrime if they are allowed back in . 
  - eu politics is complex . 
  who is the [ president of the eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_the_european_union ) currently ? 
  do you know the differences between these 4 different organisms and their different powers : [ european council ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council ) , [ european commission ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_commission ) , [ council of the european union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union ) , [ council of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) ? 
  - eu has few powers . 
  despite what national politicians like to say , the actions of the eu are pretty limited . 
  - we do n't have eu-wide elections or media discussions . 
  the latest elections were the first time i am aware of when the candidates for the commission presidency were given a bit of media time . 
  and uk reaction reminded everyone that actually this was not a vote for such a person . 
  so here you are : in european elections , people are voting for institutions with few power , they do n't even know if their votes really will decide the leader , and anyway this leader has very unclear powers . 
  for people to be interested in eu , it needs to be : - transparent - simpler - democratic - powerful it is lacking on these 4 fronts currently . 
  so basically , your argument is that uk could have been a great player to the union if the union was just about the specific interests of uk ? 
  well ... 
  ow uk , stop teasing us about it . 
  do it or not , but the bellydancing has lasted long enough . 
  de gaulle ( like churchill , actually ) never saw a place for uk in the eu project . 
  they both considered that the commonwealth was the sphere of interest and influence of uk and that it was too divergent from eu 's interests to make an integration meaningful . 
  fast forward to 2014 : despite being a supposedly `` core '' member , uk is less integrated in eu than switzerland , a non-member . 
  and the closest they have is acutally called the [ viking squad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%adkingasveitin ), 
  and the oldest european democracy . 
  there is also that . 
  do n't worry , we will send you oss117 . 
  for freedom and blanquette de veau !, 
  seriously , when you look at the horror that libya apparently was , i am not sure you want our help . 
  know thy enemy . 
  smart . 
  we only ever send our kids to england as a punishment . 
  the iron curtain was [ much more to the west ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/iron_curtain_map.svg/645px-iron_curtain_map.svg.png ), 
  cameron vetoed that . 
  note that the huge dark patches of land in finland are very scarcely populated . 
  that can give a false impression . 
  and actually , from the southern coast to paris , you will find several roads named `` route napoleon '' which follow his path back to the capital . 
  with a plaque at every place he stopped . 
  `` les cent jours '' were really an epic time . 
  `` yes , it is europe , from the atlantic to the urals , it is europe , it is the whole of europe '' [ charles de gaulle ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/charles_de_gaulle ) by the way , enjoy this vacation , right now it is ~ ~ ussr2 ~ ~ russia that our media try to depict as a barbaric country . 
  we 'll look away while you are overthrowing your government ... 
  except for louisiana , where it is worse . 
  [ giger house in switzerland ] ( http://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/styles/blog_post_media/public/gigerbar.jpg?itok=ndudnbqy ) [ the abode of chaos in france ] ( http://images.mnn.com/sites/default/files/user/130142/abodeofchaos4.jpeg ) [ the maginot line in france ] ( http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/maginot-600x250.jpg ) ( it is like new : it never served ! ), 
  if you would like to visit versailles but do not want to look like a tourist in a herd , go rather visit [ vaux-le-vicomte ] ( http://beautiful-pictures.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/le-domaine-de-vaux-le-vicomte-france.jpg ) which is the castle that versailles tries to emulate . 
  it is smaller , but imho much better and has an interesting history around it . 
  if you want to visit carcassonne but feel that it is too much of a tourist spot , visit [ the castle of pierrefonds ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/ch%c3%a2teau_de_pierrefonds,_vue_de_face.jpg ) , restored by the same architect and far lesser known . 
  if you go during a weekday , you will share an incredible castle with only 5 or 10 other visitors . 
  take your time , enjoy your new property , 
  even assuming it is a 180 nm factory , they may then be able to produce cortex-m chips http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.pfl0307-1/index.html which is not exactly stellar but much better than a 8086 ( which was 3 000 nm , a 16 bits vs 32 bits architecture ), 
  exactly . 
  the rates usually do not give much information . 
  countries used to have a much lower cancer rate when public health was so bad that half the death were due to pneumonia . 
  heart diseases and cancer are currently the two `` default '' causes of death and a high heart + cancer diseases is now indicative of a good healthcare infrastructure . 
  i bet that if you have a higher heart disease rate , you have a lower cancer rate . 
  honestly , this is a good idea . 
  i do n't understand why more countries do not do the same . 
  hardware backdoors are a very likely attack vector . 
  i could understand that some government officials would have a secure computer , probably much slower than the latest mac , but able to keep state secrets secure . 
  it would do email and cryptography and strictly nothing else . 
  years before the snowden revelations , there was a sarkozy interview where he was proud to say that he and merkel were constantly discussing on a crucial agreement * through sms ( text message ) * . 
  it shocked me . 
  they were willingly disclosing state secret to several companies which were very likely to be spied by the nsa . 
  i found that utterly irresponsible . 
  one day scandinavia , one day we will top you at something !, 
   are there truly naive western europeans who believe separatists took weapons on their own and started this deadly conflict ? 
  i discovered recently that there are very good ties between putin 's administration and several european far-right parties . 
  after all , what he has been doing in chechnya is the wet dream of many fascists wannabes . 
  these are typically anti-american and borderline conspiracy theorists so they are willing to `` question the official truth '' and think that because they read full interviews of putin that were not published in france , they are better informed . 
  talk about crimea on / r/france / and you will have people to call the referendum democratic . 
  i was surprised to discover that here in japan very few people know about [ steak tartare ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/steak_tartare#origine_du_steak_tartare ) , one of my favorite food . 
  it is supposed to come from the tatar folk but apparently the french version is quite far from the original recipe . 
  it is basically a raw steak with a raw egg and a delicious herb mix . 
  of course served with fries . 
  i do n't know if it is famous around europe . 
  also , a lot of people know about cheese fondue but fewer know about the other kind of fondue , the [ bourguignonne kind ] ( http://www.lemarivaux.com/photos/fonduebourguignone.jpg ) . 
  with either red or white wine it is a total pleasure . 
  you have to admit that he has a very specific sense of humor .
