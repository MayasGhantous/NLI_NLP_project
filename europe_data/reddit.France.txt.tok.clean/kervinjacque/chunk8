  though , its unfortunate that old hatred has n't been eroded . 
   long term relationships with sleeper agents that is the scarier part to me . 
  the fact that the women your in a relationship with is an sleeper agent and you dont even know that . 
  this is good question , i feel pretty sad and pity when i see people feeling unpatriotic towards there country , a lot of countries today would n't have existed if we did n't have people who were willing to sacrifice themselves for your country/tribe/community , etc. 
  i feel they 're a representation of the after affects of ww2 . 
  i can only hope someday , there kids will learn to love there country and what it has to offer . 
  rather then the usual `` i think its useless to be proud of being x '' then justify it . 
  though i am not judging them , just seems sad . 
  that is interesting to me . 
  even though your point is very correct . 
  i always wonder what else will be the new name that will replace , europe/africa/middle east/asia/america . 
  this is also the same for us . 
  before , we were n't called `` french '' we 've had multiple names before , same for russia and any other country in europe . 
  it 's all very interesting when you think about it . 
  i dont understand , why is being pro-europe bad ? 
  is this a right-wing group ? 
  good post !, 
  it will most likely be posted in the [ french ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/ ) sub , or maybe here . 
   you can be racist while not being white and you also can be racist to someone who has the same skin color than you . 
  this is something i believe people do n't realize . 
  it 's nice to know some people can acknowledge that, 
  this comment is really funny lol . 
  your first example are good points , what do you think as a croatian , should france/germany ( west euro ) do to make it more comfortable for the more smaller , and not so wealthy eu countries to contribute ? 
  unless croatia is willing to let go of its military sovereignty and trust germany/france . 
  if not , what would be the best alternative ? 
  latvians choice is understandable , i wont judge you guys for it . 
  i always had a strong sense of admiration for him because of this . 
  good post . 
  lol , this is funny . 
  they say . 
  that 2nd times the charm . 
  lol , i love the way ukraine came in . 
  this is funny video . 
  i read here that erdo disliked mustafa but want to be like him to . 
  you are the 2nd person i 've read mentioned this which is strange because usually , you 'd want to imitate someone if you like them and want to be like him . 
  but not hate him . 
  what do you mean by `` illegitimate veto right '' ? 
  you made a good point in your first response , when i think about it now , there are double standards , so your right . 
  it was very difficult to read this , especially when she described how her husband would drink himselves to unconsciousness while the owner comes in and does his business with her . 
  it also says how he had no choice but to allow it to keep there job . 
  it 's very depressing , especially when you read this part ,  `` the problem is the farmers are not rich men , '' says scifo . 
  `` if the owners paid their workers legal wages , ** they would lose too much money ** and the entire agricultural economy of the province would implode . 
  ** this is why the authorities look the other way ** and why it is so hard to get anyone to take action to stop this . '' i am just surprised this is happening in the eu . 
  i do hope and pray that countries in the eu help each other out in combating this sort of inhuman practice . 
  great picture , though , it gets a bit depressing when you learn about what happened to nicholas ii and his family . 
  i always found how identical both nicholas ii and george looked !, 
  i love spotify . 
  i 've came across great music because of them !, 
   especially he `` 12:00 : ekkert of ung '' i 've gotten addicted to that song lol . 
  i think i just do n't read comments as much . 
  since i rely on the sub for news and such . 
  id read it though but not as much !, 
  because i enjoy the different opinions !, 
  they do that in europe to . 
  like , i 've seen many people who did n't have german or greek features proclaim themselves by the nationality and tends to disregard there background . 
  they see themselves as the country they 're born in . 
  ethnicity is more done by some people in europe , idk . 
  its interesting you brought this up . 
  never came across people bringing ethnicity . 
  then would she be more mediterranean ? 
  since it can get hot and the more north you go , the more cold and less sun do you get . 
  right ? 
  im not good with this stuff so forgive me . 
  in one hand i agree that its unfair to not help out , lately , ive only been seeing germany and the austrians contributing and its unfair to me that they 're the ones who are doing most of the work ( of course there are others ) . 
  it sorta goes against what the eu stands for to me . 
  this sort of bickering and building fences hurts the union because people dont want to help out each other . 
  however , i can understand why some eu countries are afraid of allowing them in , given the recent incidents that has happened in the countries that has accepted the refugees and they 're scared . 
  but all of that can be dealt with if everyone is equally helping each other out and actually doing what the eu stands for . 
  helping the germans by taking some of there migrants , etc. 
  equally distributing the refugees helps greatly , also create a `` visa refugee '' type of thing and it would help combat the growing alt right communities . 
  idk , but i do support the austrians in this matter tho . 
  just my cents . 
  they could n't . 
  the germans did what we did and it appears that they did n't learn from our mistakes in invading russia . 
  how ? 
  btw , im neutral so im only speaking from what ive seen . 
  you mentioned that the new ukraine leader attacked russians , in what way ? 
  like , what happened that made you say this so i can better understand where you are coming from . 
  the king you can trust but not its nobles ? . 
  i guess i can see where the proverbs coming from . 
  the boyars are more wealthy and would prefer profits and exploitation , right ? 
  you make a good point . 
  did n't look at it that way . 
  oh okay i see why the title is wrong . 
  i did n't really notice until you told me . 
  you do make a point after re reading the title . 
  i wish people could edit titles . 
  how does titlegore work ? 
  like if i write a bad grammer title ? . 
  i guess i failed at complementing the estonians , sorry lol . 
  felt like sharing it to this sub since i first saw it and thought it 'd be cool to share it here . 
  hopefully sharing a submission from another sub is alright . 
  credits to / u/theredgiant, 
  it would be really interesting to see what would things be like with these new countries/kingdoms . 
  lol same . 
  there on to us !, 
  thats really cool . 
  i love the picture , thanks for sharing man !, 
  france is with you guys , 
  wow i love it , its really presents the people as fierce when by the music .
