( disclaimer : i 'm not denying hollande is hurting france 's image and its competitiveness . 
  if you pay attention this whole discussion was from the start always about what `` socialist '' means , and if france is `` capitalist '' or not . ), 
   what about the taxes on capital and the taxes on revenue ( 75 % ) for the rich are n't social ^ [ * ist ? 
  * ] policies ? 
  it has been discontinued ... and anyway almost every country has taxes , taxes are not specific to socialism . 
  you mentioned the number `` 75 % '' , is there some magic amount above which you switch to `` socialist '' ? 
  the maximum possible rate for individual revenue in the usa is 39.6 % ( federal max marginal rate ) , in france it 's either 75 % ( max marginal rate for a few months in 2014 ) or if you take the scrapping of the law into account 41 % , do the extra % s make france cross a line into socialism ? 
  i know the definition is not set in stone but socialism is technically about * state ownership ( `` people '' ownership in some idealised theoretical limbo ) of the means of production . 
  nationalisation is barely discussed by the current government even though you might find meek projects about the acquisition of * some * shares of some companies . 
  * state management ( again `` people '' supposedly ) of the economy . 
  quinquennial plans and things like that . 
  nothing close to that is being done to any significant extent . 
  maybe stick to `` leftist '' !, 
  & nbsp ; if you actually meant france is implementing `` social '' policies , yes it is just like every country on earth and i apologize for the unnecessary rant !, 
  but it 's still a capitalist country that 's not ideologically far apart from other western countries . 
  so the usa is n't a democratic country when the democrats are not in power , and it 's not a republic right now ? 
  that 's not how it works , france is traditionally right-wing and the ps is a centrist party . 
  the french government had some socialist policies briefly in the early eighties , and never again since then . 
  well soc lib and soc auth would both be considered left-wing in france , while lib auth and lib lib would be right-wing . 
  just because nuances exist does n't mean broad categories ca n't be used . 
  it 's not some amazing huge shift in mentalities or anything . 
  the french socialist party has been centrist for decades . 
  our president was supposed to be strauss kahn , with overwhelming support from most of the party , remember ? 
  also `` new socialism '' is not used in france , it seems like the author of the article just wants to coin a cool-sounding name for what he perceives as that great new mindset . 
  while budget cuts and reforms of inefficient administrations are discussed , there 's no debate about `` the welfare state '' and what part of the gdp the public sector should represent , the author just seems aroused by fantasising about a deliberate french decision to dismantle the state . 
  some media just love to death the narrative of french workers ' rights and public sector ** finally ** getting destroyed . 
  british expansionism on the rise , spain soon to be invaded from gibraltar, 
  well the way i see it la\u00efcity is a complicated thing , on the surface it 's just the separation of church and state ( so a formal , written law ) but it 's also a * cultural thing * , which is the main thing i 've been talking about . 
  in france the `` private sphere '' and the `` public sphere '' are two very tightly separated realms , and religion entirely belongs in the former , and this idea is widely respected . 
  so it actually makes it hard for critics to even find a reason to attack a religion : it 's none of your business and theoretically does n't interfere with anything that affects normal oblivious citizens . 
  it 's sort of in its own bubble , away from controversy , as long as it plays along with the whole la\u00efcity idea . 
  it gives every religion the potential to take an innocent , neutral high ground . 
  that 's what i mean by `` protection '' . 
  well you have to understand the catholic church ( as well as protestants in the east ) does n't really need to `` defend itself '' ... 
  it 's not doing that bad . 
  a ( slight i think but i 'm not sure ) majority of french citizens are actually christians , you just would never know even ( in some cases ) if they were your neighbours for ten years . 
  la\u00efcity actually does protect religions by not mangling them with secular affairs . 
  as for the churches and cathedrals , they 're pretty buildings that were ** a lot more ** than a place for christians . 
  most towns are entirely built around churches ... 
  they used to be places of asylum and the center of social life , they 're buildings of secular significance too !, 
  and we have awesome dolmens and menhirs too , but nobody thinks it means everyone who appreciates them should praise toutatis . 
  [ kraftwerk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkiptbbbqy ), 
  it might sound fedora-neckbeard-whatever and cringeworthy to anglo ears but france is sort of `` post-religious '' in some ways . 
  la\u00efcity is part of our tradition , so preserving it is conservatism . 
  the fn constantly invokes la\u00efcity to attack muslims for example , directly claiming christian values too loudly ( they occasionally do , but do n't put much emphasis on it ) would piss off a large part of their electorate . 
  there are vocal advocates of the protection of christianity of course , and it 's claimed by some as a fundamental part of french culture , but the framework of absolute freedom of/from religion is one of the rare things that are overwhelmingly respected and valued , a bit like freedom of speech on the other side of the pond . 
  that czech prime minister 's name ? 
  charles darwin, 
  well compare  lang : en `` pat\u00e9 '' and  lang : en `` p\u00e2t\u00e9 '' on google !, 
  pat\u00e9 wins . 
  thus by the english ever-evolving , anarchic standards , the appropriate spelling is the most comonly used !, 
  this is the first time i 'm thankful for the lack of an official english dictionnary lol but seriously good catch , i fixed it . 
   the uk is always called the `` bad european '' do you have examples ? 
  maybe you 're right but from here it looks like self-victimisation . 
  when i think about statements from the eu on the uk , it 's usually about how valuable they are and how we really should listen to them and figure out what 's wrong . 
  ( i acknowledge the eu is also very lenient on france of course . ), 
  if you 're talking about non-official accusations , well it 's sort of true but every country gets some hate you know . 
  and the uk really really hates the eu and antagonizes it constantly , so even if it breaks no rules observers wo n't call it a `` good european '' , that would be received like an insult at this point . 
  misspelling p\u00e2t\u00e9 ? 
  check ( path\u00e9 is just the movie theater chain / a family name ), 
  my sister went to the beaux-arts school there , and apparently you 're right it retains some sort of cred when it comes to design ( in some small snobbish circles , but that 's what this `` field '' is all about ... ) . 
  there 's a very intense local identity with some cool unique things ( the crassiers in the middle of the city are bizarre , the local dialect ( `` gaga '' ) is fun , some interesting foods are unknown elsewhere , a lot of minor and small stuff like that ) but nothing spectacular or interesting enough from an outside perspective to visit really . 
  i do n't give a shit about football but yeah it 's pretty insane and rousing when there 's a big event . 
   a federation ( from latin : foedus , gen. : foederis , `` covenant '' ) , also known as a federal state , is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central ( federal ) government . 
  ( keep in mind i wrote `` in ** some ** ways , a bit ** like ** '' . ), 
  there 's a central european authority , that decides * some * laws that apply everywhere , and then each country decides other laws individually . 
  here are some ways the eu is similar to a big entity containing several smaller states : * no borders as far as citizens travelling within schengen are concerned , just like it would be in a big federal state * a bunch of common regulations * a bunch of common policies * a common money for a big part of it , and extremely deep economic ties . 
  * there are some international situations in which the eu speaks with one united voice ( special status at the un that is a bit more important than the usual `` observer '' , and more and more like an actual member for example ), 
  yes absolutely . 
  it wo n't create any shock , it 's not like accidentally swearing for example , it 's just something we expect foreigners not to really grasp or care about . 
  i do n't agree it will be seen as disrespect , i think no-one gives a fuck !, 
  * the usa has a roughly similar area and population . 
  * with the eu and schengen , europe is , in some ways , a bit like a federation ( like the usa ) rather than a mere collection of countries . 
  now you understand !, 
  they did a sneaky shift towards economically far-left policies when marine took the reins . 
  might be mere populist empty promises or an actual change of paradigm , we wo n't know until they 're in power i guess . 
  they 're far-right ( they support stuff traditionally associated with the right , to an extreme extent ) when it comes to social policies , immigration of course ( the only true subject that defines everything in the universe ) , education/culture , ecology , and security . 
  good old traditional `` right-wing '' in france has a bagage of defiance towards the usa and big multinational companies , and of general `` conservatism '' . 
  think of de gaulle , he 's basically the messiah ( but not really for the fn though , there 's some debate about claiming his heritage , just like lincoln ) . 
  there 's no liberal far-right anymore right now ( well there might be a few very insignificant groups that will never catch the attention of more than 0.1 % of the population ) . 
  source : not politically educated , but i can describe the popular perception of the french political spectrum as i see it everyday !, 
  you got me , i like pilat ( and the forez too because my dad might kill me if he finds out i missed a chance to make this clear ) . 
  i do n't associate it with the city because i live so close , but i suppose you could visit it from st-\u00e9 . 
  areas 20km apart near you do n't seem like `` the same place '' like they do when you talk about regions 500km from home lol, 
  man i was blown away by saintes and la rochelle . 
  i 'm from southern france and moved close to there , and it really feels like another awesome planet . 
  who needs bretagne when charente is way less remote and provides just the same marine feeling ? 
  you did n't mention the [ marais poitevin ] ( http://www.parc-marais-poitevin.fr/var/plain_site/storage/images/node_43/images/une-conche-du-marais-mouille/5637-5-fre-fr/une-conche-du-marais-mouille.jpg ) ( granted it 's far north and shared with vend\u00e9e ) , it 's some of the most beautiful nature i 've come across . 
  ooooh i 've got one actually . 
  i do n't know why i did n't think of it initially , i 'm almost from here !, 
  ** saint-\u00c9tienne . 
  ** it 's a huge abandoned shithole !, 
  true it 's not a big area but still the 14th biggest french city so it 's not really cheating , but you can include the whole southern loire and northern ard\u00e8che if you want . 
  it 's the butt of every joke in france except sometimes for the football team . 
  all the good stuff has been vacuumed out by lyon , its population keeps decreasing ever since the coal mines have been closed !, 
  it 's a great place to live ( the cost of life is low in such a declining city ) but i really ca n't imagine a tourist coming here ( except perhaps dutch tourists but that 's not saying much ) . 
  we 're still not used to it either , he still feels like that funny fat guy in the opposition who avoids all conflict . 
  except the opposition is somehow in power and he 's somehow # 1, 
  you 'd be surprised , according to most french people he 's worse than a thousand hitlers shooting maos on disabled orphans while riding attilas . 
  it ** does ** look nice !,
