  it 's actually a bit hard to come up with a place that 's both bad for hiking/cycling and bad for other stuff ( cuisine , culture , architecture ) , the places with a lame countryside ( boring flat agricultural land ) usually compensate with cool cultural stuff ... mayenne ? 
  some nice catholic buildings ... 
  the landes ? 
  amazing duck-based dishes , just like all the south-west . 
  the creuse d\u00e9partement . 
  my guess is it 's an attempt at `` banter '' by doing the usual `` pretend-rivalry '' schtick . 
  like the british always joke about being happy at any french failure . 
  do n't be too paranoid over clumsy humour ... 
  we 'll love and welcome you just like our own countrymen !!, 
  which we fucking despise, 
  or if you 're distracted by being polish, 
  lolocaust, 
  rh\u00f4ne valley best valley, 
  i wonder how low wallonia must be if the average of belgium is similar to france ... 
  i assume he means `` what was the point of that law '' and the correct answer would be `` to discriminate against muslims and make their life harder '' . 
  this somehow makes your question about `` which is worse ? '', 
  irrelevant ( maybe because a proper `` animal rights '' law would include all abuse no matter if it 's less traumatic for the animal , while this law only focuses on halal and kosher ) . 
  but maybe he just enjoys being confusing and did n't have a point at all . 
  no way , there are too many french muslims ( around 1 citizen out of 20 ) , all that would do is create a black market here and further marginalize them , stirring religious tension . 
  avoiding that comes waaaay before animal rights . 
  it 's probably true in the uk and belgium too , and to a lesser extent in germany , the netherlands , sweden ... 
  enter the void is pretty great . 
  it 's also canadian , japanese and german . 
  [ the opening credits alone gave me epilepsy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0lngxop8e&amp;t=1m06s ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhrlps3_1fs&amp;feature=kp everyone seems to love budapest for various reasons !, 
  she 's like an elizabeth ii that gets shit done, 
  hands off !, 
  ... no wait not like that, 
  belarused again !, 
  so in northern ukraine you get as much sun as in southern italy !, 
  i did n't expect that, 
  i 'll make sure to try it if i can find one , i think i only ever ate young gouda !, 
  thanks for the tip, 
  i always shed a single tear when someone mentions gouda in a list of the best cheeses . 
  it 's nice with cumin seeds though !, 
   it 's sad that those places are getting bad reputation i 'm not sure about that , being forced to depend less on tourism seems healthy to me ... a tourism-based economy depends on the whim of foreigners and arbitrary popular trends , and fads can pass very quickly . 
  also , heavily monetizing traditions and culture seems cynical and contributes to low national morale ( having your very home put into a showcase and turned into a mere attraction just feels wrong and degrading ) . 
  but i 've heard some guys are like nazis with a weird cross symbol and everything . 
  surely you 're actually a fascist dictatorship in an ongoing civil war , this is so much less boring !, 
  well why is n't k\u00f8benhavn neatly centered ? 
  it 's basically inside swedish borders so of course it creates confusion . 
  just relocate it in fyn to clear all ambiguity . 
  the stories from `` perfectly fluent '' english speakers visiting france and encountering no-one but evil frenchmen who pretend not to understand them just out of pure malevolence always make me laugh . 
  it 's on the same level as the great global jewish conspiracy . 
  well ( just in case you actually care about french grammar , if you do n't then carry on ) the singular is not really a problem , but `` d ** u ** '' does n't work here . 
  plural or not , it 's `` salade d ** e ** nom ( s ) '' . 
  using `` du '' implies there 's only one `` nom '' in existence ( `` salad ** of the ** name '' -  salade ** du ** nom ; `` salad ** of ** name '' -  salade ** de ** nom ), 
  look at all the swooshy lines , shiny dots , blur and light effects ... 
  it 's probably supposed to be a cool visual effect with everything being in flux , like a name salad , to make a boring infographic look more energetic . 
  woosh bzz uroep pew zweep c c c c countries !!, 
  zoooooom yurp wooooop yeeeahhh oruepe, 
  i predict a lagarde-lepen second round , with bayrou third , valls fourth , montebourg fifth , aubry sixth , some commie seventh ( buffet again ? 
  ) , jean-vincent plac\u00e9 eigth , and three to six other candidates . 
  mine are both # 701 + and as mentionned by the other replies many are not even listed , so # 202 is pretty good . 
  you 're probably in the first quartile of european students !, 
  well it 's a partially independant special collectivity with a unique status so it 's not really completely france ( like guiana is ) . 
  and technically , if it 's part of france now it ceased to be a colony and it 's therefore a former colony !, 
  * algeria is a wonderful place , with gorgeous sceneries and awesome cultures . 
  it 's huge so it wins the `` most diverse '' award easily . 
  * madagascar is great too , i know nothing about the inhabitants but the wild life is amazing . 
  i like to move it , move it . 
  * new caledonia is the epitome of the `` tropical paradise '' stereotype , it 's so over the top it 's impossible not to like it . 
  * qu\u00e9bec is so cool i do n't even need to list all the cool stuff about it . 
  an excessive amount of talented french-speaking artists come from qu\u00e9bec ( qu\u00e9bec humour is my favourite ) . 
  * people from cameroon are the nicest i know . 
  * lebanon is a jewel with an incredible clusterfuck of cultures , all of them plentiful and i really wish they could get along . 
  my best friend is lebanese . 
  * niger has some nice uranium , it 's probably great , please stay our friend !, 
  * morocco is a giant , it 's doing quite good right now apparently ( at least its economy ) and its tourist-friendliness is nice . 
  it 's where the best couscous and the best taboulleh are form , not to mention the hash . 
  http://i.imgur.com/rx71wsp.png http://news.sgi-network.org/uploads/tx_amsgistudies/social-justice-in-the-eu-2014.pdf qualitative means `` assessed by sgi experts '' . 
  if i may slip my personnal opinion , basically a german private foundation ( bertelsmann stiftung ) can tweak this index saying `` evil southern europeans , your current governance is good for nothing as usual , why ca n't you just apply the same policies as germany ? '', 
  so it should be taken with a grain of salt ... 
  it even might , subconsciously when it was first designed , have been weighted in a way that makes germany 's sphere of political friends look good !, 
  of course the experts who design this index are probably honest and impartial but subconscious biases can have a lot of influence if you allow yourself too many arbitrary choices and judgements . 
  well , in europe : * first and foremost the uk actually believe it or not ( the pretend-rivalry is one-sided , we do n't even have anti-uk jokes , just pure popular love for the culture ) , * italy and spain , even greece ( though maybe in the same condescending tourist way as every first-world country and not closer ) , * nordic countries sometimes ( love or indifference/unfamiliarity but no dislike ) , ireland is sort of in the same realm ( not the baltics though ) * poland ( our good immigrants !, 
  and wwii guilt , and other historical ties ) * belgium , switzerland ( pure francophone self-centered narcissism but also some love for superior swiss ways and democracy and flemish culture ) * portugal ( perceived as chill and also a `` good '' kind of immigrants with nostalgia goggles ) the rest is not even known or is perceived as cold and unfriendly . 
  the author is bulgarian but maybe he borrowed the american acceptation of the term ? 
  like an umbrella-word for `` feels sort of left-wing '' . 
  but it 's wrong , everyone loves to love the uk , especially in mainland europe !, 
  apparently you have less `` laws and policies against discrimination '' and `` protection against hate speech/crimes '' ... 
  this is not a feels map , it 's a legislation map . 
  i agree we have the worst vocal homophobic minority in europe ( excluding russia ) but it seems like out legal system has some little things you do n't , that they deemed valuable and heavily weighted in the score .

  i get the joke but actuallly that `` 66 % '' figure is approval of the influence ** of the uk ** by uk citizens . 
  approval of the influence ** of france ** is at a mere 48 % !!, 
  you respond to our endless love with nothing but disdain :(, 
  i 'm interested in a source !, 
  it 's really not consistent with what our propaganda tells us here , maybe it 's just a fabrication to make us feel patriotic . 
  german engineering is probably not efficient and sophisticated enough to come up with reliable nuclear plants . 
  french engineering on the other hand ensures safe , controlled , suitable power !, 
  to each their own . 
  64 % of the french had a positive opinion of `` the uk 's influence '' in 2013 vs 24 % negative ( and that 's still `` political '' , not addressing our opinion about the people or the culture at all . ), 
  for comparison people in the uk answered 66 % positive and 23 % negative to the exact same question . 
  source : http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/2013%20country%20rating%20poll.pdf , page 11, 
  apparently the slightest displays of regional pride/identity are now `` separatist groups '' . 
  hey do n't talk about the massif central like that , it 's gorgeous and the view of the alps from the eastern side feels more epic than a few slight tiny temporary bumps under the sun http://www.altituderando.com/img/jpg/6/4/8/alain_bellon_pilat_9_.jpg, 
  technically nothing can `` force '' him to resign but of course in the scenario you describe he would comply . 
  but this wo n't happen , his party still has a majority in the assembly ( even if there are dissensions within the ps , there wo n't be a concerted effort between the opposition and the rebellious left-wing of the party , the hate is not quite that strong ) . 
  if he dissolves the assembly for some reason he 'll still be president and we 'll have a new `` cohabitation '' with the leader of the new opposition as a prime minister .
