  any alternative to a normal election in 2017 is too messy to happen ( unless things get much worse ) . 
  it seems like there 's no-one right now but things can move fast . 
  jupp\u00e9 , villepin , bayrou , montebourg , aubry , lagarde , some others maybe , are all somewhat tolerated and could pull a hollande and suddenly rise due to being familiar faces without being too closely associated with the last two governments . 
  i predict a lagarde triumph in 2017 , it seems weird now but once she 's back from washington and under media focus again , she 'll become huge just like strauss-kahn was expected to . 
  and let 's not neglect the possiblity of something even more out of the blue \u00e0 la obama . 
  but all those places besides maybe corsica ( probably not if there was a referendum today ) do n't want out of france ... 
  austerity is painful at first but it works in the end , i wish my countrymen could see that . 
   imagine what would happen we would learn some glimpses of many foreign languages while being perfectly able to understand each other thanks to the english version right next to it ? 
  the horror, 
  bullshit , the problem is that french people are simply not informed enough about this for a public opinion to become prevalent . 
  people exclusively care about socialists and marine lepen , other subjects are discussed only very rarely . 
  i could n't even find a poll . 
  most journalists who tackle the subject seem against the sale if that means anything . 
  you can write to fran\u00e7ois hollande here : http://www.elysee.fr/ecrire-au-president-de-la-republique/ to the ministry of foreign affairs here : http://www.defense.gouv.fr/portail-defense/rubriques-complementaires/contact to the ministry of defense here : http://www.defense.gouv.fr/portail-defense/rubriques-complementaires/contact surely your message will have a greater chance to reach the right ears . 
  oh ok , i thought you were talking about negative attention ... 
  but then , why would this obsession be perceived as arrogance ? 
  if anything it would show acceptance of other cultures . 
   germany is undoubtedly the most important country german nationalism on the rise, 
   obsessed with our aristocracy . 
  i 'm interested in that , it 's the first time i hear about that stereotype ... 
  in my experience everyone is utterly neutral when it comes to your royals . 
  a lot of past french monarchs are seen as tyrants ( our revolutions are celebrated ) , but monarchs from other western countries are either loved ( tabloid celebrity culture romanticizing royalty ) or ignored ... 
   frenchmen can not submit to a reign of injustice ouch, 
  dude you 're rich , that 's okay , no shame in that , 
  probably marshal p\u00e9tain , or pierre laval ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippe_p%c3%a9tain http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_laval, 
  yeah but i do n't think their policy is to only hire artists from the same country as their headquarters . 
  i could be wrong though . 
  the artist apparently goes by `` gonzalo '' ( he 's the one who has that weird g-shaped signature in the lower right corner ) , i ca n't find anything about him but nothing indicates that he must be belgian . 
  we will probably never know . 
  probably done by an anglo, 
   do you see french people complaining abut disneyland a lot of french people hate it actually , it 's seen as a symbol of cultural uniformisation . 
  and relying so desperately on tourism to keep the country afloat is not a good thing , it 's worrying . 
  seeing our home turned into a showcase for strangers and nothing more is a disturbing future . 
  more like richtugal, 
  french identity is a bit special though , i think being in france and speaking french qualifies you as french regardless of other cultural elements . 
  some 25 % of my countrymen would strongly object though but i feel like ( i ca n't provide data ) a weak majority agrees with that definition . 
  there 's still norway though, 
  the industry ( or lack thereof ), 
   i can see on french being looked weirdly at in some places but aside from that oh yeah if it 's just french , then who cares ?!, 
  it 's not like it 's a language that deserves respect like all the others . 
  aside from that obviously insignificant sidenote , everything is fine !, 
  why even bring that pesky unimportant dialect up ? 
   the fn candidate won 25 % of the presidential vote do n't downplay her success , she gathered nearly 30 % of the actual votes if you round the numbers even upper . 
  and it 's growing fast . 
   as a homosexual & nbsp ; sweden yes, 
   seiously , i had that talk with local algerians , they ** hate ** the second generation of french algerians *** everyone *** hates them actually , that 's probably why they 're so radicalised, 
  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  i 'm just happy my country is starting to get on the right track . 
  what i wrote two weeks ago can be fixed ( and it 's about to ! ), 
  the enemies of french capitalism can all start clenching because our soon-to-be president marine wo n't show mercy . 
  this is the beggining of a bright new era . 
  i predict the next few decades will be a new beautiful french renaissance and we 'll finally start to be more like successful protestant countries and leave corrupt , lazy leftist southern standards behind . 
  why must france always be so weak and just slightly subpar in every possible way ? 
  i wish we were protestant , and that our climate was colder . 
  maybe people who have latin roots are culturally and/or genetically inferior after all . 
  sorry if i 'm rambling but it 's getting really frustrating . 
  p\u00e9tain ou farage, 
  the market is n't 100 % driven by pure logic and full of perfectly rational buyers ?!, 
  say it ai n't so, 
  \\* pets white cat while sitting in a dark room filled with an eerie red glow \\* it would be ... a * shame * if someone , say a german chancellor was forced to take ... * drastic * action in a future that might come sooner that anyone realizes , do n't you think , poland and hungary ? 
  good thing you know it 's in your best interest to be reasonable , do n't you ? 
  he he he he , good , very good . 
  minions , release them, 
  only true euro kids will remember this le hidden gem / r/lewrongcontinent, 
  ugh , give me a break ... 
  the `` black sea '' ? 
  `` iceland '' ? 
  try to steer away from the most obvious uncreative clich\u00e9s next time . 
  it 's weird to think i live inside that tiny little nook , like some silverfish inside the a crack in the wall . 
  i for one welcome our new merciful luxembourgish masters , and will fully collaborate with the new order . 
  i 'm learning twelve languages as we speak . 
  please spare my family and the citizens of * prosperity unit e-05 * ( formerly random bits of archaic cultural constructs known as `` france '' and `` germany '' ) . 
  til toulouse , avignon , lyon , valence , grenoble and clermont are next to the sea ( or in the north ? ) . 
  it 's just province after all , just some large beach ( that only temporarily turns into snowy mountains during winter break ) . 
  getting rid of that is the whole project of macron though . 
  germanic language/culture !, 
  i 'm sure we 'd forgive a disagreement with italy way faster than with an english-speaking country too . 
  but do they ... *** deserve *** it ?!, 
  i demand revenge blargharghgaghgrah, 
  opposition is too old-school now that we 've reached the macrularity , politics are objectively solved , why should anyone be allowed to disrupt an optimized system ? 
  our dear leader macron is handsome , witty , and perfect in every way and will bring peace and prosperity to the cosmos , opposition is not an option and the mouth-breathing bullies who `` do n't agree '' ( ?!!!! ), 
  with his policies should not try anything whatsoever to prevent them . 
  yeah i see your point . 
  a bunch of unemployed people might be able to get a crappy job which is still better and could be a step towards something more stable ( however the alternative proposed by macron does n't really include consolidated redistribution and i 'm not sure this `` something more stable '' will exist for many people ) . 
  i got a bit caught up trying to show the counterpoint to your worldview but i 'm sure most people will manage to get by . 
  i 'm not trying to defend every aspect of the current system ( it 's deeply flawed obviously ) , i 'm just trying to show why some people fear the new system proposed by macron ( the first commenter seemed to think the main worry was tax cuts ) . 
   how is competing fairly stopping other people ? 
   again do n't you see a difference between forcing people to do something and a free market ? 
  first of all i agree with your analysis , but i do n't see how it means the restrictiveness of france as it is now is inherently worst for society as a whole . 
  i think i * see the difference * : group a is currently hurting group b by denying them the means to express their full potential . 
  in the hypothetical new system , the newfound freedom of group b will indirectly hurt group a by raising expectations . 
  i can see how the second way to hurt someone is more passive , but it 's still a society that half the people wo n't be happy about . 
  i think it all comes down to whether you value fairness ( like you seem to ) over the comfort of the weaker/lazier half of society ( which you seem to think should be prioritized less for now ) . 
  the french left traditionally values the latter a lot , which i 'm not asking anyone to emulate if they do n't want to , but my only point is that there 's no objectively better choice , just conflicting * interests * and different values . 
  do you agree that the interest of the less competitive is to limit competition ? 
  i feel like it 's understandable that they 'd want to protect their interest , just like more competitive people want to `` fight back '' as you put it !, 
  well people who wish for quality-of-life focused contracts wo n't be hired if there are hard-workers ready to perform the same job more intensely . 
  and it 's not always possible to achieve a living wage with a part-time job . 
  so either the first group prevents the second group from achieving their thirst for wealth and achievement , or the second group prevents the first group from coasting sustainably through a less rewarding life . 
  all i 'm saying is that it 's not a no-brainer , a lot of people will get hurt whichever direction society takes and there is no option that will satisfy everyone .
