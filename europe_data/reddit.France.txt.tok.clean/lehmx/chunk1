france is a former colony of morocco ? 
  i learnt something today thanks, 
  canadians or koreans, 
  can this country be in the eu ? 
  gallia or frankia sounds cool to me, 
  asterix & obelix contre c\u00e9sar, 
  stay safe my belgians friends , i do n't want to see what happened in my country happening in yours . 
  some french journalists are suspecting anarchists because of the recent events in france ( labor law , migrant crisis in calais etc. ), 
  more cooperation between french and german military and germany increasing their defense budget are really great news . 
  i do n't really mind these ones , but i hate the surrender jokes, 
  * germany - allemagne * wales - pays de galles * netherlands - pays-bas the three that comes to my mind right now , for the other countries it 's very close to the english name, 
  the sun is really a league on it 's own . 
  i can not think of any `` newspaper '' in france who could post such trashy articles , not even the worst far right newspapers . 
  i must be an italian then . 
  [ i feel like this ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/ncsqi9sf3pa8w/giphy.gif ), 
  well , the canard enchain\u00e9 and mediapart are serious investigative newspapers . 
  usually when they publish a scandal , it 's true . 
  and fillon acted like a righteous man during all his campaign , that 's why it 's going to be very hard for him to recover from this . 
  there 's also the fact that many french people think that employing someone from your family when you are a politician is n't moral even if it 's legal . 
  aaaand he 's done . 
  whether those accusations are true or false , his popularity wo n't recover from it until the elections . 
  at this point it will probably be macron and le pen in the second round . 
  to be honest , except for the ones supporting the fn , i 've never heard anyone having a good opinion of putin . 
  i do n't think that french people hate russia in general , but the majority of the french population knows that russian democracy is a joke and putin is a corrupted leader . 
  she does n't represent me and many more of my countrymen . 
  a woman who is willing to sell her ass to trump or putin is n't a patriot , she 's a fucking traitor just like all the ex collaborationists and p\u00e9tainists in her party . 
  well , no surprise here ... 
  well i 'm glad we did n't googled donald trump , this guy does n't deserve so much attention . 
  c\u00e9line dion , she is quite popular in france . 
  and she calls herself a french patriot , what a joke ... she sold her soul to the russians , she 's nothing more than putin 's puppet . 
  de gaulle must be spinning in his grave . 
  this feels like nice all over again , fuck these lunatics . 
  stay strong germany .

  we did it before it was cool, 
  you 're right , france has a thing for strong leaders ( louis xiv , napoleon , charles de gaulle . . ) most french people want a `` strong '' and charismatic leader , and hollande was the exact opposite . 
  he is n't a bad person like sarkozy and i think that overall he tried to do his best , but he was n't fit to be president of france from the beginning . 
  so we are probably going to have a british first lady for the first time ever , interesting . 
  i wonder how it will affect the relationship between france and the uk . 
  42 % turnout and i already imagine people bitching about macron 's party super majority in the national assembly . 
  personally i voted for him so i do n't care , but those who did n't vote have no right to complain . 
  this is horrible , i ca n't imagine what the victims have been through . 
  my condolences to the families of the victims . 
  i hope that all the dumbasses who voted for him will be the firsts one to suffer from his policies . 
  i 'm done trying to be open minded or compassionate toward dumb people . 
  macron will meet modi on saturday , he is most likely going to support this trade deal as well . 
  the start of the implosion of the fn , i 'm gon na need some popcorns . 
  i there was an actual war , this guy would be the first one to flee in the us or australia , what a joke . 
  she 's corrupted , her party has a huge problem with racism and antisemitism and was founded by ex collaborationists . 
  they think that somehow they have the monopoly of patriotism , but they would sell their ass to the russians . 
  her economic program is also a joke , i mean , leave the eu and then what ? 
  what 's her plan ? 
  no one knows . 
  imo le pen wo n't be able to improve her image or gain new voters during the next two weeks , the only way she could possibly win in the worst case scenario is if a huge scandal tarnish emmanuel macron , but i doubt it will happen . 
  i also have no doubt that le pen will look ridiculous during the tv debate , her economic policy is n't credible at all . 
  she will play the security and muslim card to the maximum , but many people are fed up with that . 
  i like the portrayal of a french resistant fighter by marion cotillard in the movie allied . 
  other than that , i 've always had bad impressions on french characters , like a bad clich\u00e9 . 
  we complain a lot and we eat baguettes everyday . 
  personally i 'm also very proud of everything we have achieved in the last decades with our european neighbours , especially germany . 
  i 'm currently living in a neighbourhood like [ this one ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ac0bt ) . 
  it 's very common to live in these kind of houses in the parisian region . 
  personally i 'm going to fort boyard with a fishing rod and i 'm living there until i die . 
  i would love to live in [ nice ] ( http://maison-cresci.fr/uploads/images/nice_cresci_slide_environnement_003.jpg ) or in [ biarritz ] ( http://cdni.condenast.co.uk/1920x1280/a_c/beach-at-biarritz-france-conde-nast-traveller-19aug15-pr.jpg ) . 
  i prefer the south west but the south of france is overall a great place to live . 
  i use a vpn to watch the us catalogue , unfortunately he is n't free . 
  paris is full of people from all over france , there 's not so much `` native '' parisians anymore . 
  so i find it funny when people from other regions call parisians assholes . 
  i think that paris represents france well enough , regardless of what some french people might say . 
  it 's a very cosmopolitan city with people from all over france and the world . 
  there 's no other city in france who can represent our entire population as a whole . 
  southwest accent, 
  mine comes from a character in the manga [ jormungand ] ( http://jormungand.wikia.com/wiki/lehm ), 
  well you need to look at other things like the quality of life . 
  for exemple i would rather be unemployed in italia than in the north of france . 
  you have a nice weather , good food and stunning landscapes . 
  [ nora arnezeder ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f1/f8/80/f1f88064aa2a8a1e7284f03cb6d91a72.jpg ) , she 's gorgeous in every way . 
  lea seydoux and audrey tautou are close seconds . 
  i think that the uk deserves better . 
  most french people are tired of the two old maintream parties . 
  the far left and the far right are n't credible enough to win a lot of seats in the parliamient . 
  and i think that a lot of people want the current government to have a strong majority so that we can actually move forward , and quickly . 
  france needs it and the eu needs it . 
  london , i 've been there 3 times . 
  i live near paris so it 's quite easy to go to london with the eurostar . 
  every morning, 
  i agree , frankreich sounds badass, 
  i would say california , they have a lot of different climates like us , a similar gdp and they are mostly progressive . 
  oh and they seem to be hated by the rest of the usa . 
  yes but it 's very expensive for the majority of the population . 
  [ black hawk down soundtrack - gortoz a ran ] ( https://youtu.be/veyzbc4wl_a ) in breton . 
  could n't have said it better . 
  the sad part is that a lot a french people do not seem to understand that we are not a multicultural society . 
  universalist yes , multicultural hell no . 
  chaotic ... well i live near paris so there 's that . 
  the french [ pays basque ] ( http://photos.tourisme-en-france.com/petitesregions/aquitaine/pays-basque/9_vue-basque.jpg ) is a gorgeous place , there 's very few tourists and you are not far from spain , 
  there 's also the solidays , f\u00eate de l'huma , rock en seine, 
  i live in the parisian region and most people are pro eu here , the fn has a very low score at every elections . 
  they do n't , that 's one of the advantages when you have nuclear weapons . 
  instead they are more subtil and try to elect a russian puppet as our president ( marine le pen ) .
