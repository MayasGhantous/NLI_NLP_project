renzi 's got down in my estime . 
  i did n't expect him to act like europhobe populists . 
  and how do you take that kind of measures if you have your hands tied with debt ? 
  complete loss of authority and consistency . 
  can you imagine some managers fighting with each other in front of their competitors and stakeholders ? 
  some people think it 's nice to have `` democracy '' everywhere for everything , but it 's not possible . 
  the economy was n't doing well already before hollande took these ( superficial ) measures . 
  european countries that have seriously taken care of deficit reduction are doing better than france . 
  you can use the vocabulary you want . 
  here it 's not the messenger that was shot , but a guy shooting toward his own side . 
  sure one expects the government to speak with one voice for national interest . 
  how come can you have ministers publicly defending opposite views . 
  that only exists in france . 
  if they disagree , they leave and fight from the outside . 
  here it seems they decided to, 
  or some ministers ( which were not elected ) decided to fight against their own government . 
  would it make sense to keep the said ministers ? 
  the problem with france is that the politicians have n't acted yet ( on contrary to other europeans countries which have already taken measures to tackle their debts ) but only taking postures against/for liberalization . 
  hollande sits in the middle trying to be friend with everyone . 
  at the end , everyone 's pissed and no progress was made . 
  thus blaming the french government for austerity is non-sense . 
  would n't they have to recognize the is state ( which will obviously never happen ) before that ? 
  turkey , it 's not this way you will join the eu . 
  finland is quite a surprise here . 
  russia , you can probably do better . 
  why a main official language ? 
  i highly doubt that people in this thread think that some races may be superior/inferior to others . 
  saying that there may be a problem with immigration ( which does not mean it is only the immigrants fault ) , is that racist ? 
  did i just become a racist just by asking that ? 
  if this is a way to reduce the far right wing importance , i think you are doing it wrong . 
  lol , swedes living in fear of nazism ? 
  are you serious ? 
  oh nice , everyone is a racist but you , wow , very nice , here get some karma . 
  that guy is norwegian , not danish ( as op is ) . 
  you are only focusing on the uk and between 1960 and 2000 . 
  overall , if you look at all countries , the increase is n't as important . 
  especially in the last decade , from 2003 . 
   does n't your image prove his point ? 
  inequality has increased over half a century , but it 's not a huge increase . 
  i do n't think that 's enough to conclude : `` we have seen in the last decades how the wealth generated has increased but has not been distributed among the society . 
  despite huge increments in productivity , the salaries have increased ever so little . '', 
  and a decrease in other countries : greece ( !, 
  ) , italy , latvia , lithuania , poland , uk , norway , . . and if you look at the average ( euro area | eu ) , it 's pretty stable . 
  if there is an increase , it 's not very significant , especially in comparison to the growth during the same time span . 
  sure . 
  the graph was taken from http://www.wikiwand.com/en/gini_coefficient#/gini_coefficients_of_income_distributions there you have all the sources . 
  so , still no source for your claim ? 
  are you going to provide one or just keep trusting your own feelings ? 
  anyway . 
  you made a claim for the last decades . 
  the graph ( i gave ) shows several decades , but now only the last decade matters to you ? 
  secondly , i have added another source for the last decade . 
  edit : you edited your comment and added the chart . 
  sure , some countries are becoming more unequal , but i do n't think that 's a general observation . 
  a comment containing `` that 's a fact '' should always come with a source . 
  it 's not a fact just because you think it 's a fact . 
  and repeating `` it 's a fact , not an opinion '' in all your comments wo n't change anything . 
  here , your `` fact '' is n't obvious : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/gini_since_wwii.svg/1920px-gini_since_wwii.svg.png?1443183122227 and here : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tessi190 sources can show fact better than your own opinion . 
  hey !, 
  read your `` evidence '' . 
  what annoys me the most is `` it should be noted that table 1 estimates the change in gdp one year after the spending occurs and says nothing about how long it may take to cut a check to a builder for a new school . '' . 
  that makes the whole `` evidence '' pretty pointless . 
  of course social spending will increase gdp faster in the short-term , but not in long term . 
  once it 's been consumed , it does n't produce anything . 
   being an eu federalist does n't mean that you have to agree with every decision that the eu makes . 
  of course . 
  it just means we take decisions together . 
  anyone can still complain and say it 's a bad decision , but at least european share a common plan . 
  this will always work better than having everyone doing things their own way . 
  can we please split europe in two ? 
  all federalists on one side , and all they eurosceptics on the other side ? 
  eurosceptics must be aware though that they ca n't ask for cash after the split was made . 
  saw some of your comments in this thread . 
  have you been raped in the ass by juncker this morning ? 
  why so much rage ? 
  i actually care more about european countries being able to agree on a solution , than the solution itself . 
  it 's a pity to see all the countries yelling how they want to do it , and give 0 fuck about a global european plan . 
  ffs , debate , raise your concerns , but then please let the majority decide , and deal with it . 
  it does n't make sense to have countries taking refugees , and countries next door refusing them . 
  refuse them or accept them , but do n't create a european clusterfuck . 
  they know people confuse it with a swastika and there is an unlimited number of symbols to choose from . 
  they chose that symbol anyway , so there is 150 % chance they actually wanted a swastika-like symbol . 
  unfair taxes is the only argument taxis can use . 
  they should only focus on that . 
  everything else is just uber being more efficient . 
  the french are . 
   they 're not as dumb or deluded as you think they are . 
  oh right , i thought greeks were the dumbest people on earth . . ** / s **, 
  i think tsipras goal has been kind of consistent since the beginning . 
  he wanted to end austerity , but not to leave the euro . 
  he made a referendum to vote against austerity , but then he could n't get rid off of austerity without leaving the euro . 
  so he chose to stay in the euro . 
  he never said he would leave the euro if he could n't end austerity . 
  greeks voted against austerity , but at the same time , most did n't want to leave euro . 
  so anyway , since it 's two contradictory objectives , one had to be renounced . 
   people gave him the ok to say `` no '' to the austerity , ** no matter the consequences ** are you sure about that ? 
  was n't tsipras saying they would n't leave euro anyway ? 
  and without the bubble , spain 's budget was n't positive . 
  in other words , spain did n't need to borrow cash because it enjoyed cash taken from the bubble why it lasted . 
  the government could have chosen not to rely on the bubble for its budget , but they did n't .
