  do n't state governors in the us need permission from a state-foreign body ? 
   how is military even related ? 
  from your own comment ...  ** russian aviation ** intensifies its bombardments, 
  how is that mocking the victims ?!, 
  you could say it 's mocking the russian army , but the plane victims ? 
  i believe any subject has potential for humour . 
  there is no such thing as blasphemy . 
  as long as : the authors can mock everything , including themselves , and do n't have a specific target . 
  ch has dumb drawings about pretty much anything . 
  it 's not agressively displayed to the victims . 
  ch was not printed and shipped to the victims families . 
  besides that , i dont care about what is morally acceptable to laugh about . 
  a good joke about the holocaust is definitelly funnier than a bad joke about clowns . 
  and the asshole has the right to call you an idiot for getting butthurt about a drawing nobody cares about . 
  there are too many offensive things in the world to make a drama about each of them . 
  have you ever read satire ? 
  i would n't even have seen the drawings , cause i never read ch and its not mediatically widespread despite what you might think , if some russian officials did n't go `` omg i am so offended by these drawings , lets diplomatically complain to france '' . 
  good job on the publicity . 
  actually it 's only some cheap victimization . 
  i do n't find them really funny either , but i do n't go apeshit-crazy about every non-funny thing in the world , i just go on with my day . 
  here is the cover ch had when a french plane crashed in the atlantic ocean in 2009 : http://p0.storage.canalblog.com/09/54/177230/40228996_p.jpg here is the cover about mh17 : http://p2.storage.canalblog.com/20/74/177230/100138185.jpg another one about mh370 : http://p5.storage.canalblog.com/59/95/177230/107191306_o.jpg so it seems that between the french , the dutches , the chinese/malaysians and the russians , the later are the most sensitive . 
  only less than islamists . 
   statistics vs your sister . 
  sorry but i choose the statistics . 
  we are not the us or even europe in 1950 . 
  well i asked for ** modern ** examples cause i was pretty sure you would take the post ww2 us example  you ca n't compare 2015 and 1950 . 
  back then there was everything to build/rebuild . 
  it has never been easier to create growth . 
  now , a 10 % deficit wo n't simple transform into a 15 % gdp growth next year . 
  the [ spending on research ] ( http://sncs.fr/sites/sncs.fr/img/bmp/figure1_.bmp ) seems pretty stable to me . 
  and [ spending on education ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/exploit/2013/03/ip/en/i13_261.eni/pictures/100000000000088000000bd86bea30a1.jpg ) is definitely increasing . 
  i speak murican bro, 
  was thinking about portugal/greece , especially when they could n't even borrow money anymore ( perfect time to make more deficit ) . 
  as for us , sure we could go with 10 % deficit for a couple of years . 
  and then what ? 
  gdp growth will automatically increase by 15 % and we will become rich just like the greeks did ? 
  or will it just double the debt ? 
  from your other comment :  it has always worked . 
  modern examples ? 
  i 've noticed the contrary . 
  right . 
  just like when you are completely broke , it 's the perfect time to borrow more money from your bank and invest it in something . 
  color me surprised . 
  you did n't read it ? 
   those already engaging in the tax avoidance scheme have a five year window until 2020 to find another arrangement . 
  from the wikipedia article :  in 2014 , the irish government announced that companies would no longer be able to incorporate in ireland without also being tax resident there , a measure intended to counter arrangements similar to the double irish . 
  [ 4 ] irish finance minister michael noonan addressed the `` double irish '' during the presentation of his 2015 budget . 
  under the new rules , companies not already operating in the country may not pursue the `` double irish '' scheme as of january 2015 ; those already engaging in the tax avoidance scheme have a five year window until 2020 to find another arrangement . 
  can someone explain like i 'm 40 , how they can so easily avoid uk taxes ? 
  it 's not incompatible . 
  companies should pay more corporation tax , but do n't expect ceos to do it by themselves ( their job is to make profit , not increase taxes ) . 
   our prime minister , who is currently under indictment , was looking for an excuse to make this happen . 
  germany and france being petty and stupid bullies provided that . 
  yeah and i 'm sure you have something proving that , right ? 
  the left populism is the useful idiot of the right populism . 
  we all know who always win at the `` who is the best populist '' game . 
  while right populism is rising , the left populism is still too busy hitting on the evil social democrats . 
  of course as a brexiter you have to make it a matter of origin . 
  as if i supported everything the french may do and complained about everything the brits may do . 
  brexiters have lost respect for the rule of law . 
  they are losing their mind . 
   you can barely unite one people in one country to be unselfish and to work together , but you 're going to unite the whole planet ? 
  good luck with that . 
  we are obviously talking about very long term here . 
   and `` work '' towards what ? 
  what 's priority to one , is not a priority to others . 
  what 's sacred to one , is not sacred to other . 
  this planet is not some collection of `` economic blocks '' , but rather cultural blocks . 
  homogenization would mean taking away from one , and giving it to others . 
  not going to happen without a fight . 
  with time , people become culturally closer and closer to each other . 
  it 's a natural process . 
  thousands of years ago , people barely cared about others living 10 km away , and now we have territories with millions and millions of people sharing the same policy . 
  step back , look at how the humanity has evolved since it appeared , and ask yourself what the long term trend is . 
  saying `` see , sometimes companies win '' is not an argument . 
  you have to explain why it is wrong that they won . 
  for example with `` ethyl corporation v. canada '' . 
  mmt was already forbidden in some states like california . 
  canada could have done the same , but it decided to ban `` the import and transport of mmt '' which technically means expropriation .

  this question is irrelevant . 
  globalization will ultimately go all the way and it 's a good thing . 
  one day the world will work altogether . 
  a better question would be : how fast should globalization happen ? 
  i 'm seriously getting tired of all these populist clowns all over the world . 
  and the far-left going all nationalist about it surely does not fuel right-wing forces . 
  it 's the logical consequence of the development of third world countries . 
  their workers compete with our low skilled workers , while high skilled workers are not impacted and benefit from global opportunities . 
  and protectionism wo n't help the poor get less poor . 
  it will only help the the rich less rich . 
  not really an achievement . 
  a fiscal union , to reduce fiscal competition between states would be a good start , but we are still waiting for states to share some of their sovereignty . 
  i 'd rather vote during elections and have the meps build some sort of government . 
  150 millions dollars in 22 years . 
  that 's absolutely nothing . 
  something similar was already proposed in ccctb but blocked by uk and ireland . 
  then some people complain about the eu for not harmonizing tax rules . 
  just give it yourself . 
  i 'm too busy striking .
