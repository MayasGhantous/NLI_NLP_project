  do you have a source ? 
  i 'm interested in reading more about it . 
  i agree that one region should n't be able to block the whole eu process , but as for now the belgium legally ca n't approve it without its regions allowing it . 
  it 's not possible to bypass existing laws and it is a belgium internal issue . 
  i agree but then all states will have to agree to a new treaty before the approval process changes . 
  i 'd say it 's fair game since treaties were such that it required unanimity . 
  some matters can be decided by the eu parliament only , and others depend on states/parliaments approval . 
  however , calling it undemocratic that the eu still wants to push for ceta and convince wallonia to accept it , or that `` democracy won '' because wallonia voted against ceta , is ridiculous . 
  the eu does n't have to change its mind and be against ceta just because wallonia is against ceta , they still have the right to defend this project . 
  nobody from the eu is using the word `` ultimatum '' ( which by definition comes with a threat ) . 
  it ' only the anti-ceta side using this word to victimize themselves . 
  edit :  ** walloon premier paul magnette ** has said the summit should be delayed to allow more time to deliberate . 
  `` an ** ultimatum ** is not compatible with the exercise of democracy , '' he was cited by belgian public broadcaster rtbf as saying on sunday . 
  out of subject question . 
  greeks were tired of the two big parties and corruption , so they tried syriza . 
  now they are tired of syriza too , and according to the last poll the right wing party is now first again . 
  why the hell do n't they try a new moderate party like to potami or another one ? 
  maybe it has changed . 
  is there a new poll saying they now want to leave ? 
   hence the crippling austerity measures that the imf says are not going to work . 
  you are making this up . 
  the imf asks for debt forgiveness , not for the end of austerity . 
  please report actual facts . 
  how does that even make sense ?!, 
  greeks do n't want to leave and other countries do n't want to lose their money . 
  you try really hard to make it sound absurd do n't you ? 
  eu loans came with a longer maturity and lower rate than the previous ones . 
  greece surely have accepted those new loans for no reason , eh ? 
  just go straight to your point . 
  edit : way more advanced than british-american trade deal ? 
  the german cars industry not supporting brexit , now this . . it 's as if brexiters were delusional . 
  good idea . 
  make a new treaty with russia every time it invades a country in europe , to congratulate them . 
  sure , back then half of / r/europe was greeks afraid of going homeless and the other half was people throwing peanuts . 
  ridiculous . 
   one side was in crisis in fear for their country falling apart , the other side was throwing peanuts from the gallery . 
  among the first side they were people ( especially people not even concerned with greece but just with a fitting political agenda ) accusing the rest of europe of being fucking assholes for being responsible of everything happening in greece and for not giving away money and more money without conditions . 
  vitriol was going both way . 
  singers expressing their own opinion like they are officially representing a country . . fuck that . 
  austerity was never meant to help gdp growth . 
  it makes absolutely no sense to think so . 
  it was `` only '' meant to prevent anther sovereign debt crisis . 
  you did n't look very far . 
  the last `` nobel '' laureate in economics , french , is pro euro . 
  you obviously do n't pay much attention to economists , except the few vocal ones you agree with . 
  confirmation bias . 
  the consensus among macro economists is definitely not for the end of the euro . 
  and other highly knowledgeable people disagree with him . 
  this argument of authority does n't work . 
  just look at the way the gbp is moving when an announcement regarding brexit is made . 
  edit : downvotes wo n't change a fact . 
  one can still think this is not a paradise for the workers even if the population has chosen so . 
  that 's why brexiters plan to lower taxes , to try to remain attractive to `` paragons of virtue '' , despite brexit . 
  did you think they were planning to kick the banks out of the country after brexit ? 
  muh sovereignty . 
  who cares about big banks . 
  can you consider it a victory , when opponents ( lib dem and tories ) are happy with it ? 
  edit : i summon my downvoter and ask him to explain why tories and lib dem should fear corbyn . 
  i think they are very happy with that . 
  i think politics is somehow cyclical . 
  in the long term it improves , but in the medium term , people tend to go back to foolish solutions ( because they look easy and efficient ) , until they realize again , how inefficient and destructive they are . 
  the problem is not marine le pen making it to the second round . 
  well , it 's a problem but not that bad because she is very very unlikely to win the second round . 
  the problem is that we may get two mad politicians in the second round , and then we are fucked . 
  for example , le pen and sarkozy . 
  this time the presidential will be played on the first round only . 
  whoever passes the first round , is very likely to win . 
  on the right , there are two candidates that can pretend to go this far , jupp\u00e9 and sarkozy . 
  i really hope jupp\u00e9 does not lose to sarkozy , because then , not many people have great hopes of beating sarkozy and le pen in the first round . 
  on the far left , m\u00e9lenchon is at best at 15 % ( and honestly i do n't consider him better than the other two anyway ) , on the left , montebourg , hollande , etc. 
  are all very low , and the center is n't very solid . 
  bayrou had a chance in 2007 , but now he is over , and macron is n't ready yet , but if he somehow makes it , he could gather the `` votes utiles '' ( useful votes ) to get ahead of sarkozy and le pen . 
  my top 3 in order of likelihood to become president , jupp\u00e9 , sarkozy , macron . 
  the center left to center right somehow care about the economy . 
  center left is slowly leaving the old french social-democracy attitude for more social-liberalism , and the center right talks about measures to make the economy more competitive . 
  the far left and the far right though ... they are in their own little utopia . 
  surely the only reason to complain about orban is because he `` does n't submit to the eu '' . 
  it 's a very though dilemma . 
  as i said , right now i 'm only starting to consider it . 
  sarkozy actually went further in craziness than le pen in some ways . 
  for example not even le pen denies climate change . 
  also , sarkozy is not the only crazy populist in his party . 
  he could make a full government of people fucked up just like him , if not worse ( wauquiez , estrosi , balkany , etc. ) . 
  i do n't really have any reason to vote for le pen , but the reasons to vote against sarkozy , are piling up . 
  i 'm at a point where if the second round is le pen vs sarkozy , i might actually vote le pen to stop sarkozy from becoming president again . 
  the hicp inflation forecast is interesting . 
  i wonder though what 's their plan because it seems that so far all their monetary tools did n't do much , but alright . 
  but with a gdp growth forecast at 1.6 % in 2018 , it puts the limit at 3.2 % , pretty close to the current one . 
  there may be some margin for countries with lower than average growth and with a deficit that is already way over 3 % . 
  that reduces the number of countries for which the eu could make an exemption . 
   certainly it 's not guaranteed , but if you 're going to assume any rate of inflation to create a deficit target you 're going to use the one the central bank targets . 
  target is the most optimistic outcome , and often better than the result . 
  using a prediction as a basis , ok ( and if the ecb predicts the inflation will be at 2 % next year , then a 3 % deficit makes sense ) , using a target as a basis , i do n't think that 's a safe plan . 
   the situation in the ez and japan are n't really similar either , the low inflation here is temporary and mostly caused by low energy prices . 
  the ecb is forecasting it to rise to 1.5 % over the next two years . 
  source ? 
  ( genuine question ), 
  japan has been in that situation since two decades . 
  this is starting to sound like long term . 
  the ecb is already trying to produce some inflation .
