  one has to be pretty fucked in his head to write the sentence you quoted . 
  his fans have a funny reason to justify this . 
  it 's dangerous to let le pen say everything she says . 
  so sarkozy better defend her points instead of her . 
  it does n't make any fucking sense , but eh , sarkofans . . 
  not only . 
  nobody even knows when and how it will happen . 
  many people even doubt it will actually happen . 
  so yeah , quite funny that brexiters are already celebrating that there is n't more bad economical news due to brexit . 
  are you able to make a difference between should and is ? 
  we agree on `` it should '' : it 's would be the moral way to go . 
  but in fact , people are still voting for them despite them being scumbags . 
  do you understand or should i give up ? 
  this has nothing to do with libertarianism or anarchism . 
  you can have a `` world nation '' with a strong state . 
  we did n't become anarchists just because we went from petty kingdoms to the large nations we have now , and we wo n't become anarchists when our nations will federalize . 
   it should oh yes it should , but it 's not . 
  people vote for very dishonest politicians since ... ever ? 
  at least for britain we can now assume they did n't profit from hosting the last summer games by cheating with their own security service . 
  edit : it 's not allowed to make sarcasm about sotchi :( ? 
  i 'd say : pretend turkey is still trying to join the eu , but the eu is being mean and would n't let turkey in despite all its efforts . 
  then * blame eu intensifies * , and blaming others is a key part of populism . 
  first , every time it is being postponed , the probability that the brexit will actually happen , is lowering . 
  secondly , the market does not expect may to go full retard , leave the single market and all . 
  if brexit there is , it 's very likely that it will be just like before , except with the uk out of the political and decision making entity . 
  the [ hard brexit ] ( https://twitter.com/nigel_farage/status/764739841527545856 ) farage is dreaming of wont happen . 
  yeah , our governments should congratulate putin for invading ukraine . 
  no , assange promises a lot but the leaks are worthless . 
  the akp mails full of spam . . his comments about the democrat being assassinated , without giving any proof . . his suspicious antisemitic tweet ... 
  he is full of shit . 
  i do n't understand why people still upvote assange 's teasing . . 
  by a strange coincidence , it 's always the far left and far right extremists . 
  those people just want to watch the world burn . 
  i agree , i meant the eu wants to block this initiative for good reason , but thanks anyway for the pinpointing the specific rules . 
  ... and for good reason . 
  hats off to her . 
  populism does n't need evidence . 
  i was n't aware she was in charge of france already . 
  i have a big news for you . 
  our politicians are not as reckless as casual redditors . 
  surprising is n't it ? 
  if you position yourself as an european for 2 seconds , and think about the whole picture , i 'm sure you can understand there is no point kicking erdogan out and getting a civil war in turkey as a replacement . 
  democracy has a definition . 
  removing judges and imprisoning people only on suspicion ca n't be called a `` democracy '' . 
  even though i disagree with op 's plan . 
  yea but it 's not that easy . 
  let 's say you replace erdogan with someone else . 
  a majority of turks right now are pro-erdogan . 
  it wo n't go well with the new leader and your `` restored democracy '' . 
  the problem is not only the government itself , but also the people electing it and approving its actions . 
  sorry to turks reading this , i know you are not all like this , especially on reddit , but the motivations of a majority of the turkish people are really part of the problem . 
  it 's not just an `` elite thing '' . 
  so then why do you reject their opinion simply because they are called `` economists '' and claim something which is apparently incompatible with your opinion ? 
  you are trying to reverse the sides . 
  right , let 's ask the angry man from down the pub . 
  do you follow american politics ? 
  even some republicans are calling him insane . 
  there is way too much to say about him . 
  indeed , good news , but do n't worry , there were more news today and there is food for everyone . 
  trade balance non-eu ( june ) : -4,16 b ( -2,50 b ) trade balance ( june ) -12,41 b ( -10,00 b ) manufacturing production ( monthly ) ( june ) -0,3 % ( -0,2 % ) industrial production ( monthly ) ( june ) 0,1 % ( 0,1 % ) ( expected ) ps : people downvoting because they do n't like contradictory statistics , ah !, 
  someone explains me the downvotes . 
  all numbers are in there : http://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/ now please use your brain and give me an actual reply . 
  does n't seem like my comment is at the top at all :d and noticing some people enjoy anything that `` causes butthurt '' only for the sack of it , is surely not a call to do the same . 
  it 's an example ( ** e.g. ** ) . 
  did i say there was erdogan fanboys here ? 
  i could have made an example with martians or anyone . 
  does n't mean there are martians on reddit . 
  got it ? 
  perceptions ( feelings ) ! = what actually happens e.g. 
  erdogan fanboys * feel * that the eu is being very mean to turkey and that erdogan is their savior . 
  i have yet to come accros a top comment saying :  anything that causes this much butthurt to / r/russia ( or russia ) has to be positive . 
  '' ** wannabe ** dictators '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure he would go full retard if he got any power . 
  sidenote , here is the kind of comments that gets upvoted on / r/russia : https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/4wqq0h/eu_on_edge_as_putin_erdogan_set_to_meet/d696yye  anything that causes this much butthurt on / r/europe has to be positive . 
  this mentality . . very sad and childish . 
  what you are saying is irrelevant . 
  the negotiation process may have staled , but during this period neither one tried to push the other one away . 
  but now turkey decided it wants to go away , so ... bye ? 
  you ca n't blame the eu for what turkey does now . 
  we do care that he tries to take a authoritarian grip on turkey and demonize the eu . 
  it 's harder for him to demonize the eu when the eu is being patient and when he is being hypocrite with `` trying to join the eu '' while violating all the requirements . 
  he just looks like an idiot to everyone who is not yet a erdogan fanboy . 
  it 's a rhetoric game . 
  it does n't mean it would be our fault , but it would be exploited by erdogan . 
  let 's try to be smarter than him and not give him opportunities to play his nationalistic and victimization game . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with his actions being our fault . 
  i think authoritarian governments are meant to fail hard in the long term . 
  it goes against the normal development of politics so there is backslash at some point . 
  it 's not a surprise most authoritarian governments historically have had a harsh end . 
  so to me he only plays a short/medium term and opportunistic game . 
  oh and for befriending erdogan and others , same thing , i think playing the divide and conquest game rather than mutual development tends to backslash sooner or later . 
  although i agree the turkish government is acting like idiots , i think this kind of offensive comments ( still much less offensive than all the bullshit erdogan spits ) is counter productive . 
  let him make a clown out of himself and do n't give him material to victimize and complain about how the eu is being mean with turkey . 
  all he wants is go break all ties with the eu so he can go further with his new authoritarian and nationalist policy . 
  i 'm blown away by how fast erdogan is spinning . 
  a few months ago , putin accuses erdogan of financing daesh himself . 
  and now : `` putin is my friend ! '', 
  no , politicians are usually a bit more subtle than that . 
  losing all credibility because you change side every 6th month is not an efficient way to do politics . 
  trump , erdogan , . . is putin creating a club for wannabe dictators tired of good old democracy ?
