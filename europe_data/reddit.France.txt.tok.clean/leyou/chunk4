  i 'd appreciate if you could express yourself better and stop playing with words . 
  `` wrong all the time since the beginning of the crisis '' now becomes `` wrong for the period between the target date and the date of the estimation '' ... whatever , i 'm done with you . 
  maybe you should edit your comments then . 
  the part you quoted ends with :  that 's a bit of an exageration to say they admitted being wrong all the time from the beginning of the crisis . . and you reply with :  it 's not so what am i supposed to understand besides : `` no , it 's not an exageration to say they admitted being wrong all the time '' ? 
   you ca n't dismiss the magnitude of an estimation error by appealing to absurdity . 
  but it 's not what i said . 
  i simply said , it 's an big exageration to say the imf is wrong all the time because they underestimate some coefficient in 2013 . 
  of course it matters , but it 's simply not `` being wrong all the time '' . 
  that 's it . 
  i just ca n't follow your logic here : wrong a few times  bad effects  wrong all the time . . with that same logic , all economics are wrong all the time . 
  so well , then the whole point of saying `` oh look hes wrong all the times '' becomes totally pointless . 
  sorry but this is ridiculous . 
  do you know any economy expert that can make 100 % accurate estimations for the next years ? 
  no , because there is n't . 
  not a single one in the world . 
  all governments ca n't even know exactly what will be their gdp growth in the coming quarter . 
  so it 's totally dumb to say the imf would have been wrong all the time because they underestimate a coefficient in 2013 . 
  then all economics are wrong all the time and it becomes totally meaningless to say so . 
  since economy is n't 100 % reliable , then maybe we should randomly pick numbers and make reforms based on that ? 
  indeed , i 'm not sure what you mean here . 
  first , your website only shows annual nominal gdp , so you ca n't see how quarterly gdp evolved . 
  and with deflation , it 's not a surprise real gdp is higher than nominal gdp . 
  real gdp is basically nominal gdp less inflation ( or plus deflation ) . 
   is it ? 
  i 'd argue the surplus needed to service the debt is rather important , given the fact that the crisis is fundamentally about debt sustainability . 
  this has been said plenty of times . 
  greece 's interest expenditures as % of gdp is lower than other countries : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11372369/three-myths-about-greeces-enormous-debt-mountain.html  as an aside , how do you plan on dealing with the byproducts of spending reduction in a recessionary period , namely rapid decreases in national income for the short run ? 
  this is called the multipler effect and it 's taken into account by all econimists . 
  sure , reducing spending decreases national income . 
  but this is expected , since greece 's gdp was artificially high ( helped by the deficit ) . 
  when you take out drugs from an addict , at first he feels worse , but then . .  the `` new policies '' caused ( or at the very least , exacerbated ) the peak difference between pre-crisis gdp and the levels shown in your graphs . 
  the fact that there was moderate growth in gdp is n't exactly cause for celebration , especially once you consider my first point regarding deflation . 
  again , with an artificially high gdp ( bubble ) , and a crisis , the gdp could go anywhere but down . 
  this is a graph i posted on reddit some time ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3e2jkr/greece_germany_france_and_italys_gdp_growth_since/ and nobody is saying : `` hurray , we did it , economy is awesome now ! '' . 
  again , all i 'm saying is things started to look better . 
  anyway , sorry but i 'll stop there , did n't really want to start a new endless conversation about greece 's economy . 
   well ... imf is wrong all the time from the beginning of the crisis but anyway.they already admitted that . 
  afaik , the only thing they have `` admitted '' , is that they underestimated the multiplier effect . 
  that was in 2013 if i remember well . 
  otherwise , they blame the government for not reforming as planned . . that 's a bit of an exageration to say they admitted being wrong all the time from the beginning of the crisis . . well , if european leaders only had to chose between samaras and tsipras ( who was promising to stop the reforms ) , it 's not a big surprise they chose samaras . 
   considering that the growth of real gdp coincided with a nominal growth slower than that of average prices , i 'd be weary about deeming the nd tenure as a success : your website shows a positive real gdp growth from 2014 q3 . 
  is that a collapse ? 
  is that better than gdp growth in 2013 , 2012 , . . or not ? 
   i really ca n't understand the rationale behind this idea that , somehow , a country which has run both a negative balance of payments and a trade deficit for most of the decade will find the means to miraculously finance the necessary surplus required the meet the obligations of the memorandum ( seriously , a 3.5 % primary surplus over the midterm ?! ) . 
  it 's just absurd . 
  this is getting out of subject ( i 'm just saying statistics were starting look better in 2014 ) . 
  and i do n't understand why a negative balance of payments in the past years would necessarely prevent a government from reaching a surplus . 
  government reduces its spending , and there you have it , a surplus . 
  no need to finance anything . 
   are you really attributing a decrease in unemployment to the austerity policies of the nd government ? 
  considering the impact of their tenure over their entire term , this seems a tad bit ironic , no ? 
  so if i understand you well , new policies must have positive effects immediately ? 
  unemployment was increased for some time , so when things start to reverse , it ca n't be becaue the policies are starting to make an effect ? 
  i 'm totally losing you here . 
  that only says results wo n't meet the expectations . 
  it does n't say wether it 's because expectations were not correct/too high or because the government did n't do its job well . 
  in the report i linked above , the imf blames the government . 
  i 'm not sure which report you are refering to ( link ? ), 
  but i found this one : https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15165.pdf  if the program had been implemented as assumed , no further debt relief would have been needed under the agreed november 2012 framework because ( according to them ) : lower fiscal targets , lower privatization proceeds , lower economic growth , clearing arrears , rebuilding buffers and paying down short-term borrowing , interest rates . 
  reading that , it seems they blame the government much more than the predictions . 
  statistics were starting to look better late 2014/early 2015 . 
  let 's see how it goes with capital control now . . edit : ok since i 'm being downvoted : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth-annual http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/consumer-confidence http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/employed-persons statistics from late 2014/early 2015 are nothing like a continual collapse . 
  more like the end of a collapse/or even the start of a recovery . 
  edit2 : this is so lame when a lurker comes in and downvote all the subcomments of a discussion . 
  the retard doing that should at least post a reply . 
  what 's that flair ? 
  eu = fourth reich ? 
  come on . . you ca n't be serious . 
  you ca n't just show a graph with rising s&p 500 and call it a bubble . 
  look at the p/e graph ( price/earning ratio ) . 
  it 's much more meaningful . 
  http://www.multpl.com/ s&p is nowhere near the dot com/housing bubble levels . 
   as a contrary investor waiting nearly a year for this turnaround i need more popcorn . 
  did you put your money where your mouth is ? 
  the news is sad but i see no reason for the nsfl tag . 
  not even nsfw . 
  keep the nsfl tag for real nsfl stuff . 
  ** france ** paris : arrogant assholes east ( alsace ) : germans west ( bretagne/basque ) : regionalists that wo n't surrender to the glorious french empire south : loud people , drug dealers and murderers . 
  ~ ~ ahah , is that a serious comment or is it sarcastic ? 
  i seriously wonder . ~ ~ ~ ~ in case it 's really serious ( ... ) , people should keep trading at the same price because of democracy ?!, 
  what 's the fucking relation ?!?!?!, 
  my god that 's one of the dumbest thing i ever read on reddit . ~ ~ edit : ok , reading your other comments i guess you were joking :d, 
  please , inform yourself before blindly throwing some bold statements . . 
  there was a ** 50 % ** haircut in 2012 . 
  states bought 50 % of the debt , and the creditors lost the remaining 50 % . 
  they had months to ask greeks . 
  they did n't need to wait until 7 days after the payment due date ...  when we shoul dhave at least let the banks take a bit of loss they took a big chunk of the loss . 
  there was nothing new there . 
  greece accepted the reforms or defaulted , and thus left the eurozone . 
  syriza could choose between : - refusing the deal and try their own socialists stuff . 
  - accepting the deal . 
  they chose to accept the deal , but in the worst way possible . 
  not only they won nothing politically , but they also damaged the economy by taking months to make a decision . 
  i do n't see any reason for syriza fans to rejoice . 
  again , they could say fuck off and try their own thing or accept the deal quickly ( still austerity but at least without damaging economy ) , but they chose austerity + damages . . wtf ? 
  who is going to be satisfied with that ? 
  i feel like you did n't read my comment . . ? 
  the sarcasm in your comment sounds like you implied the scale was chosen on purpose . 
  nobody chose that scale , all charts on tradingeconomics are dynamically generated using the same logic : lowest/highest values as boundaries for the y-axis . 
  of course this will go back up ( maybe not to the same level as before though ) , but it 's not like it wo n't affect trust in the economy and yearly revenues , right ?
