  loans from imf and eu have very low interest rates and long maturity . 
  what else do you need ? 
  the good old myth saying austerity destroyed greek economy is ridiculous . 
  greek 's gdp lost arond 30 % since 2009 . 
  greek government spending dropped around 20 % since 2009 . 
  greek government spending are around 55 % of gdp . 
  so , with 0.11 % ( 20 % * 55 % ) less money injected into the greek economy , the gdp drops by 30 % ? 
  almost 3 $ lost for every $ spared by the government ? 
  goddamn , those public euros had some crazy return on investment !, 
  wow , we should all go all-in deficit then !, 
   feels like we 're a minority on / r/europe says the top reply of the top comment . 
  alright greece !, 
  looking forward to see you leave the eurozone !, 
  enough bullshitting populists for me . 
  definitely not the kind of europe i want .

  definitely not the kind of europe i want . 
  i 'm so tired by the people saying `` it ca n't get worse '' that i kind of want them to try it and see if things really ca n't get worse . 
  hint : greece 's gdp per capita is 18000 usd . 
  bulgaria 's gdp per capita is 4700 . 
  somalia 's gdp per capita is 200 . 
  things ca n't get worse ? 
  the whole referendum is a joke . 
  planned two days before the payement due date , and only one week in advance . 
  propositions are not even translated and explained to the people . 
  government saying `` no means staying in europe and renegotiating propositions '' . 
  varoufakis saying that a yes would wounden democracy . 
  and it goes on and on . 
  and people call that `` democracy '' . 
  thanks for the translation . 
  `` terrorism '' sounded very bad . 
  however , `` to win so they could humiliate the greeks '' and `` spreading fear '' still sound terribly populist . . 
   no one called anyone varoufakis is no one and creditors are nobody ? 
  ok .  even the scummiest of editors would not turn that into `` he called them terrorists '' . 
  oh , people doing acts of terrorism are not terrorists ? 
   if [ everything varoufakis says is right ] , they are terrorists first , nobody has shut off liquidity to the banks . 
  second , this will happen sooner or later , because greek banks are insolvable ( who lends money to insolvable entities ? 
  nobody , not even the ecb ) . 
  third , who started a referendum one week after payment due date ? 
  thus provoking a bank-run ? 
  thus forcing government to close the banks ? 
  edit : i 'm so astonished people can go along with such a cheap rhetoric . 
  come on , calling the eu ( among other creditors ) a bunch of terrorists ? 
  did you lose your mind ? 
  greek government going full ~ ~ retard ~ ~ populist . 
  this balances with tsipras appearing on tv every day to call for a `` no '', 
  i will say it differently . 
  greece 's gdp is around 241 billions $ . 
  until gdp reaches 0 , things can still get a lot worse . 
  if you think it was an `` economic disaster '' , i wonder what you 're gon na say about post-default greece 's economy . 
  `` economic apocalypse '' maybe ? 
  good job syriza !, 
  here we are . 
  syriza killed greece . 
  or . . we can see how fucked up greece will be and teach a lesson to other political parties that were planning to raise a finger to the eu . 
  and do n't forget , there is no come-back or `` sorry eu , i was wrong , gim me more money '' . 
  it 's an all-in bet !, 
  i did my best but it 's pretty hard having a sincere discussion with someone whose ideological arsenal only consists of limited binary logic . 
  i got it . 
  your whole intellectual reflection is basically : pro-referendum = democratic / critical toward referendums as a way to promote democracy = anti-democratic . 
  sure that makes it easy to classify good and bad people , and as it 's purely a subjective intellectual construction , i see no need to contradict that . 
  right , but a no would basically mean an exit and the question is not really important . 
  that does not change the fact that a referendum is an unpredictable/inconsistent ( people vote based on their mood at a specific time ) binary choice answered by people that have a limited knowledge of the subject ( the average greek joe barely knows in details what its government and the creditors have been negotiating and how those decisions would impact their economy ) . 
   do you think the greek situation has been stable with a long term visibility in the past years ? 
  even if you disagree with its success , you ca n't deny the objectives have been clear since the crisis : stabilize and reduce the debt through budget surplus . 
  with referendums and their binary answers though , one day you will have `` let 's leave the eurozone ! '', 
  and the next day , big u-turn : `` let 's just seal the deal with the troika '' . 
  that 's pretty much gambling the country on a coin toss . 
  nothing thoughtful here . 
  saying `` i know , what am i asking ? 
  democracy ? 
  crazy ! '', 
  does not open conversation for counter arguments as it seems you label everyone disagreeing with you as anti-democratic . 
  but since you are asking for counter arguments now , governing with referendums gives 0 stability and long term vision . 
  people 's mood go up and down . 
  is greece supposed to leave and enter the eurozone every couple of months ? 
  it 's a good political tactic for syriza though . 
  with unreal premises they put themselves in a situation where they have to make a bad deal . 
  of course they do n't want to assume responsibility for it , so they 'll let the `` people '' assume it , even though it takes gambling the whole country 's future . 
  of course it is passive-agressive sarcasm . 
  just like your `` i know , what am i asking ? 
  democracy ? 
  crazy ! '' . 
  i find this referendum pretty stupid . 
  does that make me anti-democratic in your binary vision ? 
  wow , you are so edgy . 
  you are the democracy savior europe needs !, 
  is anyone censuring you here or preventing you from voting at elections ? 
  please call mods or the police then . 
  btw i 'm very sorry other french people disagreed with you . 
  but eh , democracy \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  democracy ? 
  crazy !, 
  it 's sad people react so vehemently . 
  thanks for keeping it civil on your side . 
  however i do n't understand the logic behind this rule . 
  why is the rule `` must be located in europe '' instead of `` must be realated to europe/europeans '' ? 
  i thought this sub was intended for discussions related to europe , not just about things that are in europe .
