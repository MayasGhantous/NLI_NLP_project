  if there is a political meeting between european leaders and foreign leaders outside of eu , does it become irrelevant for this sub just because it 's happening outside of europe ? 
  taxi drivers, 
  bunch of morons . 
  we should strip them their taxi licence . 
  i 'm curious though how cabbies handle uberpop in other countries ? 
  is it only in france that they go full retard ? 
  we should make a giant wall all around france right ? 
   you seem to think that they should go to the uk , which makes no sense . 
  it 's not my position and i made it clear [ here ] ( http://ua.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3aq1ah/france_must_provoke_diplomatic_incident_with_uk/cseyvxr ) . 
  was just being ironic to a guy who said `` seriously how is it our problem when they are in france '' . 
  i 'm all for stopping immigrants before they go to britain , but it 's not just `` france 's problem '' . 
  i 'm sure they are all kind of things french authorities could do better . 
  but that 's not the question , and anyway , i 'm not qualified ( on contrary to all `` reddit immigration experts '' ) to assert whether they are being effective or not . 
  i 'm all for expelling those migrants out of calais , but in practice things are a little more complicated than in theory . 
  you can park them all in jail , but is that effective ? 
  you ca n't throw them out into a random country . . etc. 
  the only thing i 'm saying here , it 's easy to sit in uk and blame france for immigrants . 
  i 'm pretty sure things would be similar if countries were swapped . 
  agree with most of it although in practice it 's not as easy as `` round 'em up and ship 'em back home '' . 
  you need cooperation from the home country ( which is lacking a bit . . ), 
  tell me , where would you send those migrants ? 
  pick a random country in africa and throw them all in ? 
   beyond the hyperbole , there is some cooperation going on , and some acknowledgement of joint responsibility . 
  i think , however , that the outlandish comments made by the mayor of calais are n't helping at all . 
  i definitely agree with that and i ca n't really judge the cooperation ( i have no idea if 12m is enough or too much for something like that , so i give it the benefit of the doubt ) . 
  i 'm just astonished that 19 people can agree with a dumb statement like : `` britain has 0 responsibility and should give 0 fucks about migrants in calais '' . 
  that 's a common thing to do with flights but i doubt this can be enforced for trains and ferries . 
  they carry cars , trucks , containers , etc. 
  so it 's a lot harder to check than just verifying a passport and letting you take a seat on a plane . 
  i think that would just kill the traffic going to uk . 
   not let them into france in the first place are you serious ? 
  as if will was the only condition to stop immigration . . and how come the uk is still getting immigrants although it does n't want them ? 
   make them leave ? 
  http://www.wikiwand.com/en/illegal_immigration_in_the_united_kingdom what are you waiting for to repatriate all those 310 000 / 570 000 illegal immigrants ? 
  right . 
  so my point is : french customs could definitely let immigrants cross the channel ( and let the uk deal with it ) . 
  if they do n't , it 's only as a favor to the uk . 
  note that i 'm not against french customs blocking immigrants , but it 's ridiculous to say that `` it 's not britain 's problem '' . 
   you signed the no border agreement , that 's what happens when you do n't think a head . 
  please , enlighten me and explain me how the schengen agreement makes france responsible for uk immigration ? 
   did n't learn your lesson from ww1 or ww2 , you lost 3 wars because of belgium for crying out loud . 
  ahah , with a french flair it 's always so easy to make a british so mad . 
   we do n't want them or never asked them to come oh yeah sure , france did want them and asked them to come . . wait . . no we did n't , we should let them leave france . 
  such a dumb top-comment . 
  france could let immigrants cross its side of the border and let it be a britain 's problem if you prefer . 
  same thing with eu border countries having to handle immigrants trying to come into europe . 
  they are essentially controlling immigration for the rest of the eu and the whole eu should help . 
  it 's not because uk is separated by several countries from the outside of the eu that it 's not its problem too . 
  even with a 25 % drop they are still pretty high . 
   presuming that you were going to default ? 
  that 's the first thing not to do if you are really interested in having a good economy . 
  and even the pig countries that are said to be applying `` austerity '' still have a high deficit . . 
  the `` omg eu is so thatcher liberal crazy '' thing is ridiculous . . 
  she basically has no idea about what happens after defaulting and a euro exit ( as everyone else , even the best economics ) . 
  all we can say is that prospects are not great in case of such events . 
  it 's just gambling and wishful thinking . 
  i do n't think that 's how one plans a nation 's economy . 
  yeah , maybe , with luck , magic , and god 's help , the default and the euro exit will save greece . 
  and if that does n't happens , well , was nice to have you in the developed countries greece !, 
  the greek government is n't really helping building trust in their economy . . 
  oh sure , annahiliting what 's left of the greek economy will definitely end the `` humiliation '' . 
  from this chart , what allows you to think that cutting expenses hurts their revenues ? 
  nothing but your own interpretation i guess . 
  already replied to trucidator . 
  and maybe , just maybe , situations are different cause one screwed up so much that it ca n't even afford its expenses while all other eu countries still can and are not dependent on loans ? 
  well , uk is always an exception in eu matters  france is not complying but they will get sanctions as any other country if it lasts . 
  the point is , almost all eu countries agreed for this pact . 
  pretty much only greece sees it differently . 
  oh yeah , asking its countries to stop adding more deficit to a 90 % debt is a `` stubborn ideal '' right ? 
  . . or , it 's just greece `` unwilling to have it any other way '' while all other countries in europe agreed for the stability and growth pact . 
  nice !, 
  first time meeting a soothsayer !, 
  could you please also tell me how are sovereign bonds going to evolve in the next few months ? 
  i have money to invest . 
  and then we will put greece or the eurozone in prison right ? 
  there should n't be there at all . 
  it kills any credibility i could give to the author before reading it . 
  it immediately shows how hard he tries to inject his own interpretation of the story into his article instead of trying to argument with objective facts . 
   imagine you 're in prison for not being able to pay your debts . 
  ( you 're right , it 's almost unthinkable -- civilized societies no longer lock up bankrupts . 
  but bear with me . ), 
  after five years of misery , you lead a rebellion , take control of the prison , and demand your release . 
  the jailers respond by cutting off your water supply . 
  should you back down and return to your cell , perhaps negotiating for slightly less unpleasant conditions , in order to obtain a little liquidity ? 
  or should you keep fighting to be free ? 
  that , in essence , is what the standoff between an insolvent greece and its eurozone creditors is really about . 
  was hard not to laugh loudly while reading this . 
  is this guy even trying to write something serious ? 
  i do n't think you understood me well . 
  portugal may have reduced its expenditure , but only went from terribly bad ( 10 % deficit ) to quite bad ( 4.5 % ) . 
  so , even though it was even worse before , it does n't change the fact that your government is still spending 4.5 % more than it can afford at the moment . 
  that 's the opposite of `` austerity '' . 
  btw , portugal is [ still spending ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-spending-to-gdp ) more [ than germany ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/government-spending-to-gdp ) in % of gdp . 
  so with your definition , germany is in some big austerity too ? 
   look at portugal we started our bailout with a debt of 90 % of our gdp and we left with 130 % because portugal 's deficit [ was never below 4.5 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/government-budget ) . 
  a bit illogical to call that `` austerity '' do n't you think ? 
   = 4.5 % deficit is everything but `` austerity '', 
   their gdp has been reduced with 25-30 % due to austerity https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc austerity came after the crisis . 
  you ca n't blame austerity for all the debt-crisis consequences . 
   well , neither can we let greece collapse .
