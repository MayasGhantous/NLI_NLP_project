  which is in fact what would have happened if there was no bailout money . 
  we will just agree to disagree . 
  just one thing about iceland , [ you should read that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/399pwo/iceland_put_bankers_in_jail_rather_than_bailing/cs1ll1f ) . 
   and cutting pensions would n't really make a difference in the debt payments , the sums going back and forth are that big . 
  it 's not about repaying the debt , but about having no more deficit . 
  the minimum greece must do is to stop increasing the debt . 
  at the moment they are still increasing it every year as they are still in deficit . 
  maybe banks could have participated more , i 'm not informed enough to answer that . 
  but for sure we could n't let the banks collapse . 
  things are not that easy . 
   as i 've said before , it makes little sense to discuss the greek issue in this subreddit , but anyway . 
  poor you , people disagree with your opinion ? 
   the greek state could afford its regular expenses if it would default in 2009 ( or even earlier ) uh ?!, 
  in 2009 the budget had 10 % deficit . 
  without more loans they could not afford their regular expenses . 
   a default would result in great losses for german , dutch and french banks . 
  sure , but that does n't contradict the fact that greece benefited from the bailout . 
  everyone benefited from it , and greece even more . 
   but most economists agree that : i ) the average greek family would suffer significantly less than it already has due to austerity rofl , blantant lie . 
  a few economists does n't mean `` most economists '' . 
   ii ) the greek economy would have a unique opportunity to restart , something which is still forbidden by the european debt-collectors . 
  restart with collapsed banks and nobody to lend them money , great new start !, 
   you will hear several people saying that greece received new loans with a very low interest rate . 
  this is also an evil oversimplification to make greeks look bad once again . 
  if you want to know more about this , i might explain . 
  that 's a fact . 
  very low interest rate . 
  [ have a look at that ] ( http://www.ppp.mnec.gr/sites/default/files/financial_files/state_budget_%20execution_april_2015.pdf ) . 
  5.569 for net interest payments in 2014 . 
  that 's not even 2.3 % of their gdp . 
  and no thanks , i do n't need more of your own biased explanation . 
  i only take real sources and statistics . 
   why do you find it `` honest '' and not honest ? 
  neither one . 
  i just ca n't know if he 's saying the truth or lying because i was not in the eurogroup meeting . 
  you on the other hand claim that he is honest although there is absolutely 0 zero proof or corroboration , only his own words . 
  it 's not because the bailout money did n't go directly into the people 's pockets that it had no utility . 
  that 's a very dishonest rethoric . 
  bailout kept greece afloat so that the government could continue serving its regular expenses . 
  without the bailout money , there would have been a domino effect and you can be sure the people would have felt it . 
  is that ironic ? 
  what makes him more `` honest '' than the counterparts ? 
  this has been answered 10 000 times . 
  there is exactly 0 fact in oc 's comment . 
  i 'm downvoting you until you back the original comment up . 
  then i 'll upvote you . 
  his comment comes with 0 explanation about what is ttip . 
  only his opinion about what he thinks would be the consequences . 
  that 's not an expected answer to an eli5 . 
  but sure it pleases the anti-ttip circlejerk . 
  that 's a shitty and very biased answer . 
  yes it is brigaded but not by the people you think . 
  reddit is an anti-tipp circlejerk . 
  look at this thread . 
  almost all comments favorable to tipp are being mass-downvoted . 
  where do i vote for ? 
  edit : angry anti-ttip ( which ca n't accept the fact that others may have a different opinion ) people downvoting me :d, 
  come on . . for all eu countries :  the fiscal discipline is ensured by the sgp by requiring each member state , to implement a fiscal policy aiming for the country to stay within the limits on government deficit ( 3 % of gdp ) and debt ( 60 % of gdp ) ; and in case of having a debt level above 60 % it should each year decline with a satisfactory pace towards a level below . 
  that implies a surplus greater than debt service when debt is over 60 % . 
  for the imf : https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/pam/pam49/pam4903.htm  to sustain the debt . 
  if government debt is unsustainable , a primary fiscal surplus will , in general , be necessary , and the debt problem may be so severe as to require an overall surplus . 
  indeed , a surplus itself may increase the sustainability of government policies by sending a highly visible signal to economic agents of the government 's prudence . 
  http://www.wikiwand.com/en/structural_adjustment https://www.wikiwand.com/en/stability_and_growth_pact from that you can find plenty of examples . 
  rofl , as if greece was some kind of unique experiment, 
  same rule applies to every other country . 
  if you want to reduce your debt , of course the primary surplus should be greater than the debt service . 
  that 's common sense . 
  how come would you reduce the debt otherwise ?!, 
  and btw you know what ? 
  greece 's debt expenditure is even lower than italy as % of gdp . 
  sure , this happens , but it 's not solely because of a government 's initiative . 
  i doubt any government can just decide and change its economy so quickly that the gdp growth would increase by 6 points within a year ( or that 'd be like a revolution ) . 
  such an event would need very favorable external factors . 
  i guess the troika should have left greece with their enormous debt and interest rate , which they could n't even pay anymore , so would have been cut off from any loan for years and forced to go from -10 % to 0 % deficit within one day , with collapsing banks . 
  i 'm sure you would have liked that so much more . 
  economy is not linear . 
  some quarters will be lower/greater . 
  in the long run , from 2010 , the gdp growth rate has been increasing , until finally being positive for the 2014 year . 
  when gdp growth goes down to -5 % you do n't suddenly recover from -5 % to 1 % in a year . 
  the increasing rate in between , is the process of recovering . 
  and oc mentionned a '' ** feeble ** recovery '' , which you denied entirely . 
  about syriza , we ca n't yet say if they destroyed the recovery , but the huge capital flight is not a good sign . 
  since you like drug related metaphors , what you are saying is `` good , you are taking less drugs now , so you are fine , keep going with the other 30 % '' . 
   no , the fact that austerity results in reduced economic activity has been established now . 
  almost everyone accepts it at this point . 
  that 's what i meant when i said `` they paid for this with their blood '' . 
  you ca n't put the genie back in the bottle pretending that facts are n't facts . 
  many people would agree that austerity does not help for short term gdp growth , but aims for long term . 
  and certainly not `` almost everyone '' would agree that the greek 's current economy is due to austerity more than their debt 2008/9 debt crisis . 
  you are trying to make an argument of authority by confusing both . . 
  of course , their deficit was so goddamn huge . 
  they went for extremely bad to just quite bad . 
  that 's better but definitely not a completed objective . 
   they paid for this with their blood , since it destroyed the country 's economy and welfare . 
  thanks for your emotionally tainted opinion . 
  that sophism is so reccurent here that i 'll just forward you to that page http://www.wikiwand.com/en/post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc poor greeks , not being able to have an economy without being in 10 % deficit . . 
  asking them to have a reasonable budget is `` destroying the economy and welfare '' . . how come all other european countries are able to do it ? 
  strange . 
  what ? 
  deficit was still around 3.5 % lately , after having been above 10 % for several years , and they call it `` job done '' ? . .
