  the plan is not to wait for them to repay all their debts , but to reform , stabilize their long term budget and get on the right track . 
  there is not point in cutting their debt if it comes with no economic improvement . 
  the debt has very low interest rate and very long maturity ( amount of debts is only one variable ) , so it does n't make it unsustainable at all for greece . 
  dishonest answer here . 
  bailout money has much lower interest rate and much longer maturity . 
  stop acting like the bailout money was useless . 
  that 's a pretty good indication how france is hard to reform . 
  immigrants assimilate better outside of europe ? 
  that 's news to me . 
  oops , just noticed i used the wrong chart . 
  this one is up to date : http://media.gotraffic.net/images/isdjsgxmdeqs/v239/-1x-1.jpg capital flight is even greater than during the 2010 crisis . 
  wannabe revolutionaries throwing their irl frustration on / r/europe . . 
  soon the titles on / r/europe will be like : `` a source of mine confirmed juncker plans to make a military dictatorship '', 
   that statement is all opinion and no content . 
  exactly , but if you were honest , you would say the same about your own statements :  the fact that everyone is now blowing the doom trumpet just proves that they are ideologically opposed to a change in policy and are using questionable means to enforce a certain policy on greece . 
   if a landslide victory for a party is n't allowed to change government policy , then let 's abolish elections at all , since they are ignored anyway . 
  they can change all the policy they want , but treaties and arrangements are tied to the state , not to a specific government . 
  again , changing governments does n't cancel all these treaties and arrangements . 
   the trojka ca n't have their cake ( dictating greece 's policy ) and have it too ( shoving off the responsibility for debts and all that goes wrong on the greeks ) . 
  if they want to dictate every detail of greek policy then they have to take the responsibility for that and run for election as a party in the greek democracy . 
  europe is not ruling greece . 
  otherwise there would n't be all these negotiations between the two entities . 
  do n't you think ? 
  europe did n't create the greek deficit . 
   you have to , because they have n't even had to put their policies into practice , so you only have your prejudice to go on . 
  all they have achieved so far is worrying everyone about the grexit . 
  see that chart : http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iex_bhtavyx0/v49/-1x-1.png that tells you how big the capital flight is . 
  there could be compromises if syriz had shown good will and successful reforms . 
  `` change in policy '' means nothing . 
  it can be for the better or for the worse , as syriza is doing . 
  a change of government does not cancel the responsibilities of a country . 
  do you imagine loans being cancelled at every elections ? 
  or treaties being redefined ? 
  let 's make a 90 degrees turn in policy every time a european country elects a new government . 
  and do you really think europe should follow greece 's ( 1.5 % of eu pop . ), 
  new government instead of the opposite ? 
  be serious for a minute . . syriza may be your model but it 's not the european model . 
  i see a lot of bad arguments against `` austerity '' , but they are still definitely more consistent than trying to argue that europe should be making a 90 \u00b0 turn in policy just to follow the new choice of 1.5 % of its population . 
  ask for money ? 
  they are pretty good at that it seems . 
  that 's actually spot on . 
  it 's annoying that , as smart as they can be , krugman and others feel entitled to speak about any subject out of their own expertise . 
  they are turning from top-tier experts into some sort of `` jack of all trades , master of none '' politicians with a vague opinion on everything . 
  but eh , there is an audience for that . 
  i 'm sure his academic work was worth the prize , but it 's hard to understand how such a talented guy can then go lowering himself to that kind of blog articles . 
  i understand though , it does n't take much effort and there are always some people to praise him for whatever comes out of his mouth . 
  i got it , it 's not ** the ** nobel prize , but very similar name , delivered by the same institution , and as famous as other nobel prizes . 
  so what 's the point with being nitpicky here ? 
  but you are n't the royal swedish academy of sciences . 
  are you ? 
  well , if you want to be very nitpicky , let me rephrase it :  krugman has hit a new low . 
  ca n't believe that guy is a nobel memorial prize winner . 
  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/nobel_memorial_prize_in_economic_sciences  the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences [ ... ] commonly referred to as the nobel prize in economics, 
   true , avoiding a full-blown crisis would require that creditors advance a significant amount of cash , albeit cash that would immediately be recycled into debt payments . 
  krugman has hit a new low . 
  ca n't believe that guy is a nobel prize winner . 
  just think about that : before tsipras =  no grexit , after tsipras =  everyone fears grexit . 
  strange is n't it ? 
  and no , tsipras is not going to save greece 's economy , ** especially by making everyone lose trust in their economy ** . 
  it 's sad for them but greece doomed itself . . 
  choosing bad leaders , even with the best intentions , comes with tragic consequences . . 
  i 'm all for it , the problem is that we do n't know from which countries they are from , and we ca n't just send them to a country we think they came from . 
  when you see them crossing the border , then you can expel them . 
  so you do n't mind when a government expropriates a company ? 
  or when a government arrests journalists for arbitrary reasons ? 
  just because the government is the ultimate authority ? 
  well , they always can , nobody will declare war to them because of an expropriation , but if you want companies to work in your country , you better treat them with fair rules . 
  i have absolutely no problems with corporations suing a government if the government unfairly violates their rights after they made investments . 
  it does n't make corporations superior to laws . 
  why not admit ? 
  i know , nationalism and populism , but hey , at some point you just look plain ridiculous and many countries have admitted their genocides and they are not doing worse . . 
  golden international look who 's talking, 
  http://forum.hardware.fr especially the `` discussions '' category . 
  that 'd be a bubble if states were taking more loans than before . 
   must be re-approved by ** all ** eu countries, 
  it says `` data source : based on data from the oecd . '', 
  but i really could n't find those data . 
  all i could get is a csv file from http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/incomes-across-the-distribution/ but no idea where it comes from . 
  it does n't even seem to show income levels but ppp levels ... 
  `` well done !, 
  your score : 97 % 03:01 '' first try . 
  only mixed skopje and sarajevo but i had some blind guesses in the balkans and a bit of luck , 
  a 2013 article ? 
  really ? 
  at best , it reduces the number of smokers . 
  at worst , it does nothing and we lose nothing . 
  and it 's only one among many insentives to stop smoking . 
  it 's not like if money laundering was more difficult to find out . . wait . . 
  well , that 's what the whole country was trained as . 
  non-economists would have had the same ideology , but only with less knowledge . 
  it all depends if you trust more : * the people of europe * the technical experts ca n't speak for the rest of europe , but when i see that more than half the people of france are either ready to vote for a populist lady or a corrupted ex-president , i ca n't say i trust the french democracy . 
  the average opinion of millions of uninterested people rarely produce the best result , especially in economics . 
  politics is full of people with 0 technical knowledge but great communication skills . 
  in that aspect i respect european leaders far more than ours . 
  1st example coming to my mind , italian democracy had berlusconi . 
  european technocracy replaced him with monti . 
  now of course having only experts has risks too , but in any case , it 's not just with `` more democracy '' that we will solve everything . 
  it 's a tiny bit more complicated .
