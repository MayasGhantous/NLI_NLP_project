a friend i might have really hurt is visiting this town right now . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  the thing is that luxury brands are generally looked down upon in france : * leave a bmw parked somewhere in paris and you 'll find it scratched . 
  * if you 're a politician , wear brand clothes and you 'll be criticized by the media . 
  ( i mean , even if you 're highlighting a strength of the country as you said ! ), 
  * a specific example : when sarkozy was elected president in 2007 , he went to celebrate to one of paris 's best restaurants . 
  the public reacted very badly and he was labeled a snob . 
  when should you go to the best restaurant ( think luxury goods again ) if not the day you 're elected president !, 
  that 's what i meant when i said that the french are stepping on their own toes when it comes to luxury goods . 
   luxury products i find it funny how the french can be so opposed to this achievement . 
  as an expat living in france : most people know about the eiffel tower , but are not aware that it was built as a part of the secularist movement that eventually found its way in the heart of france . 
  if you 've ever seen it up close , you may have noticed the several [ names of french scientists , engineers and mathematicians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_72_names_on_the_eiffel_tower ) . 
  but let me blow your mind . 
  you know the sacr\u00e9-c\u0153ur basilica ? 
  it was built during during the same period as the eiffel tower and supported by anti-secularists . 
  try to picture paris at the end of the xix century , recovering from the franco-prussian war , and filled with citizens who disagree on what should be the role of the church in the state . 
  each side with its own colossal monument being built . 
  must have been exciting times . 
  i get your point , but angela merkel is the * head of ~ ~ state ~ ~ government * . 
  if they wiretap thousands of people you do n't know , that 's surely condemnable . 
  ( i 've certainly been pissed off from the beginning of the snowden affair . ), 
  but wiretapping the phone of * head of ~ ~ state ~ ~ government * , that 's a whole different game . 
  i mean she represents the interests of all germans ( whether or not they voted for her ) . 
  she has a huge influence in eu matters . 
  if i were german , i would take it like a diplomatic slap on the face . 
  they eu should n't take this shit from the us . 
  i really hope they come out with an appropriate response . 
  i did n't know it was possible for someone to * not * deserve a funeral . 
  mais [ le cassoulet est anglais ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71e3xe0a4zi ) !, 
  awesome . 
  so glad for italy !, 
  note that this is [ from 2004 ] ( http://spaceinimages.esa.int/images/2004/10/no2_levels_over_europe_-_zoom_for_detail ) . 
  i wonder what this looks like today with de-industrialization in some areas , stricter regulation ( i speculate ) , and demographic changes . 
  [ have a look ] ( http://www.deakin.edu.au/buslaw/aef/workingpapers/papers/2008_20eco.pdf ) . 
  how about adding sunshine into the equation ? 
  what year is it ? 
  slip for underwear ( why ? ), 
  i detest the word baby-foot . 
  half of it pronounced in french ( ba-bee ) , the other in english . 
  as a whole it does n't really represent table football . 
  why not ` foot de table ' ? 
  not corny nor annoying enough i guess . 
  baaaaaa-beeeeeeee edit : speeder-man , speeder-man . 
  the amazing uulk . 
  the o-bit ( hint : lotr ) ... oh do i hate pronouncing english words in french . 
  it 's also comparing snowden to einstein ... 
  imo the main reason he did n't get reelected ( as in other european countries ) is the financial crisis that brought lower economic performance in france . 
  people generally overvalue the impact a given president has in the economy . 
  still paradoxical since hollande got himself elected as the anti-sarkozy . 
  the thing that bugs me the most about azerty is having to press shift for the numbers . 
  in qwerty , the intl. 
  language setup ( with dead keys ) deals with the stuff you say is hard to find . 
  stop panicking . 
  as it is , it wo n't be from account holders . 
  if a spanish bank fails , which would be unlikely to happen * because * of this tax , then account holders are the last to be punished under current european deposit guarantee schemes . 
  it 's a tax on financial institutions , not on the account-holders . 
  in english :  this tax on bank deposits [ ... ] does not affect savers but requires credit institutions to pay for the deposits they capture . 
  i do n't see how associating negative thoughts/feelings to their cause could be a good thing . 
  it 's not the kind of defense i would like to see of gay marriage or any good cause for that matter . 
  `` is this the kind of people that support gay marriage ? '', 
  not every kind of reputation is desirable . 
  i disapprove violence under any circumstance . 
  i do , however , * expect * violence under [ some ] ( http://puu.sh/1rido ) circumstances . 
  you can do that without having to insult . 
  how can they criticize sarkozy only to use the same phrase after ? 
   the arrogance of the rich also , do n't you think you are generalizing out of only * one * guy ? 
  this sort of mentality is what that type of language fosters . 
  he was heavily ( and rightfully imo ) criticized . 
  now they use it against the rich to sell and people applaud ( `` i see what you did there lol '' ) . 
  this sort of self-righteousness is what i hate in french leftist media . 
  this paper is crap . 
  look at footnote number 15 . 
  basically , they proved that combats between the army and the guerrilla diminished when the latter was weak . 
  not only does this sounds like a tautology , it also fails to provide evidence of a deliberate reduction in efforts to eliminate the insurgency . 
  like the us electoral college ? 
  that has n't worked really well you know ... 
  for the record causation was not implied by op . 
  i read something like this ( i do n't remember any figures ) from stiglitz 's book `` downfall '' . 
  there should be more on this on his latest book i suppose . 
  the basic argument is that the poor have many necessities to accomplish in relation to the rich . 
  therefore , upon an increase in income , the former are more likely to consume while the latter are more likely to put the extra cash in the bank . 
  upon a lack of aggregate demand ( as in the current crisis ) what you want is more people spending money . 
  i just learned about `` newropeans '' , anyone know them ? 
  it 's funny how people do n't consider the possibility that greece could be in this same mess had it not entered the eurozone . 
  this is very related to the 18 % vote result got by front national in france . 
  being an immigrant ( no french nationality ) , i still think immigration policy should be discussed without any stigma . 
  if i can not contribute to the french economy i have no right to be here . 
  some people might hate him , but sarkozy has invested a lot of energy to the european project and i feel he does n't get enough credit for that . 
  you need people like him to muddle through the mess that is europe right now . 
  unrelated train-story : coming back to paris from amsterdam on thalys . 
  train stops for an hour and a half due to an electrical problem , it gets hot inside ( no air conditioning ) , but they offer refund forms . 
  i send the form , then a month later receive an answer : refund policy states that delays for +1 hour get a full refund . 
  your train was delayed ** 59 minutes ** for traffic problems . 
  enjoy a 15 % discount on your next thalys purchase . 
  no love for the balkans ? 
  goran bregovic has to be on the list !, 
  two of my favorites : [ kalashnikov ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyryevhizgw ) & [ get the money ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oapsnjxssrq ) with iggy pop . 
  i just sent an access request  my google services are in english so do n't worry . 
  does anyone have more info on the blame on eurostat and other eu institutions ? 
  this is what bugs me the most and the least clear part from this piece .
