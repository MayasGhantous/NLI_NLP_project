  more like you did n't catch it because he did . 
  you guys are so funny , you follow french politic only by catching up the big title . 
  you have no [ follow up on things ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/presidentielle-macron-denonce-des-attaques-informatiques-repetees-17-02-2017-2105517_20.php ) . 
  anyway , we 'll get to see more of this , since a pieds noirs association is suing him . 
  but you probably did n't know about that either . 
  50 days before our election . 
  people are never going to use it . 
  nobody keeps in checks ours , that 's for sur . 
  when was the last time a journal attacked another over the quality of their news ? 
  [ they are corporate ] ( http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/img/png/ppa-1-8.png ) . 
  wtf are you saying . 
  lmao you are wrong all the way . 
  bah just reddit thing, 
  he hasnt shared his prigram yet . 
  wait for the 3rd march . 
  talking out of your ass again / u/citronbleu , thinking you figure out where i vote . 
  except vomit and poop arent the emoji considered in the analysis . 
  i dont have time to upvote downvote anyone ... 
  so no . 
  its not me . 
  wow , where did i say that ? 
  i said it was legal . 
  find what i 'm making reference to genius . 
  hint , it 's probably the object of the article . 
  it 's not news and it 's perfectly legal . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  our need for doctor is n't filled because we simply do n't have enough compare to the need . 
  so while it 's true they will be drained , it will happen only if they have to spare at the equilibrium of the job market france/romania . 
   are they when romanian doctors leave romania to go work in france ? 
  are they when french companies decide to build a factory in romania and not in france ? 
  yes . 
  they exactly are . 
  their need to find job in france fill our need to get more doctor ( something we extremely lack ) . 
  the need of our company to find a country affordable for the business fill their need to have a production on romanian 's ground . 
  imo , it 's already been decided . 
  german will get the engineering & ground force ( famas to hk416 ) . 
  france will get anything aeronautics / naval related . 
  our defense minister said they consider another aircraft carrier , already preparing the public to the cost . 
  both will split everything production related with everyone in europe . 
  i 've had to deal with those type of analysis myself at work and they are pretty wrapped up bullshit . 
  saying 18.1 % of twits are positive base on the emoji used ( especially when you see the selection page 21 ) is nothing but professional by my book . 
  keyword is much more reliable way to assess someone 's tone online . 
  between :  `` belle escroquerie de macron & bayrou '' and  macron & bayrou ( flame , lol ) i 'll take the word any day . 
  and also like i said , [ who the fuck use twitter in france ? 
  ] ( http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/527be03269beddc664df1736-960/bii_twitter.png ) puerto rico as more user per capita than france . 
  leclerc * also , the leclerc tank is made by a company ( nexter ) that just merged with it 's german equivalent to form the company kant , so the leclerc is n't french anymore . 
  imo both you and / u/anarchotech are right . 
  he just see one step ahead of you . 
  when you say we have different economy need than other , it 's true if `` other '' stand for china/russia . 
  but for other eu countries like romania , our needs are theirs . 
   do you really think that a eu army would have fewer different weapon types ? 
  if french can stop buying french made famas to buy german 's hk416 , anything is possible . 
  the only conservative politician in france [ christine boutin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democratic_party_ ( france \\ ) ) whose current representant is jean-fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric poisson . 
  fillon 's program is n't conservative nor religious . 
  while he said he revered thatcher for her ability to reform despite the protest , his reform program is light compared to hers . 
  are you on drugs ? 
  he is almost a carbon copy . 
  you 'd need to take the conservative part of the fn to find something similar to a republican . 
  you are correct . 
  in 2015 , the highest scoring party for the 18-24 group is the fn equal with socialist at 35 % . 
  this was before the even bigger rise of the fn . 
  who use twitter in france ? 
  how is this representative of anything ? 
  also , sarcastic smiley would fuck up the estimation . 
  i 'm not saying the trend are incorrect , just that the methodology is more than questionable . 
  that methodology . 
  they measure the twitter response of the macron/bayrou alliance base on the emoji used in the twitt . 
  wtf . 
  that look like anor londo with less verticality . 
  lmao , this fucking question repeated over and over . 
  and what make you say everyone watched those media ? 
  you are just assuming garbage taking yourself like a fucking example . 
  `` oh i 've seen it so everyone must have '' . 
  this is so fucking dumb . 
  saying you are dumb as fuck would still be an understatement . 
  ok , calling the 5th a dictatorship . 
  no need to read more of your post . 
  go live in a real dictatorship , see how your spoiled ass consider the 5th after that . 
   everyone knew that polls would change with the departure of bayrou no . 
  unless you are everyone . 
  are you everyone ? 
  so do n't say thing out of your ass . 
  / u/xbettel is part of r/macron , so obviously the main subject is n't hamon . 
  also , where the fuck did i say the context was in the article ? 
  overal , you are just doing another useless post . 
  immobilism is the d\u00e9finition of the 4th . 
  you are preaching for something you try to avoid . 
  under the 4th , there will be no majority . 
  every text will be block by others . 
  say sanction need to be voted against russia , you think le pen will let that pass ? 
  the prime example of insanity . 
  trying again and expect different result . 
  you guys have absolutely no education in politic . 
  you repeat previous mistakes . 
  that 's the real danger . 
  wtf are you talking about . 
  the 4th lasted 12 years , nothing got done . 
  i do n't even remotly understand how you can compare it to the 5th . 
  except none of you has any idea of the subject , french system/situation/problem / needs . 
  you hype macron because somewhere you read that he is pro-europe .
