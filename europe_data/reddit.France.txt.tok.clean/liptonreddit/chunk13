  `` me president , none of my ministry will cumulate mandate . '', 
  once again he got fucked by the ps . 
  he was questioning the very reason of the existance of the party that already put him back into oblivion . 
  that 's a one way love . 
  people will shit on him while he is sometime saying the thruth . 
  we have lots of polution pick on eastern side of france due to germany 's activity . 
  this sub would claim the world is flat if farage said it was round . 
  you are calling me homophobe because i 'm not pleading the way of the lgbt . 
  what a joke . 
  ok now this message doesnt even makes sens\u00e9 . 
  you can just had a massive `` no show up '' for the left just like in 2002 for the 1st round . 
  granted it sound like a fiction but i would n't consider impossible anymore . 
  of course it was impliyed . 
  who gives a fuck what a 8 years old think ? 
   guess i 'm with the 3/4  you forget the right also wants to reform it . 
  so you are with the other half . 
  now frankly i do n't give a fuck where you vote . 
  1/4 of france say otherwise . 
  who knows what can happen ? 
  justice block fillon tomorrow , scandal on melenchon and sur she can . 
  you actualy think im going to spend 17 $ and 3h + reading that shit ? 
  i already waste enough time on reddit, 
  ah yes !, 
  an english news site on a french voting subject !, 
  i 'm sur all those foreigner awareness are going to make a difference on the matter . 
  except i 'm not questioning the `` quietly '' but the `` end same-sex marriage '' . 
  but i assume you only read the title , that you do n't know what taubira 's law is , nor the subject in general . 
  so whatever . 
  i figured out a long time ago you could not get much . 
  but i had hope for a concept as simple as this : gay site will give pro gay version of story . 
  just like you , mods on r/macron , ca n't give a proper critic of your candidate . 
  is this simple enough now or my words are still too big ? 
  in the 3000 years of chinese civilization , you pick the 35 years where it was n't illegal ( 1912/1945 ) . 
  you are funny . 
  also , no . 
  that 's shit level of cultural understanding to think their is `` one path '' to progress . 
  it 's not how it works . 
  it 's like asking a decent critic from you of macron . 
  pretty much impossible . 
  homosexuality was pretty much ok pre-church , so i guess 45 bc are calling for yours . 
  also , today , there are still more countries against lgbt than for . 
  just to remind you , lgbt are illegal in china & india , 1/3 of world 's population . 
  you do n't know trump . 
  [ crash course class ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xecev4dsaxe ), 
  it would probably be inconstitutional now . 
  the promess of the program are n't `` conseil '' proof . 
  but reddit is going batshit crazy while we do n't even know what would be in her super pacs package . 
  some lgbt might even consider it an improvement ( even if i doubt it ) . 
  yeah , exactly what putin said in crimea . 
  lmao , i swear this website is full of morons . 
  / u/arrbeen _ throwzor is not french and it seems he does n't understand at least 26 % of it 's voter . 
  that moment when people are tricted into thinking fillon is more conservative than the fn . 
  yeah so el khomri it 's ok for leftist to piss off people for weeks against their very own government , but mpt , is a no no ? 
  progress is not a `` straight line '' . 
  different country do thing differently and it 's not because china does n't copy us that they are `` less evolve '' . 
   there is a lot of hyperbole in ~ ~ this thread ~ ~ . 
  `` pink news '' , very neutral source , it 's probably not going to be bia ... nevermind . 
  that 's impressive but not really news , spain has always been pretty high in that ranking . 
  good to see they still manage to find room for improvement . 
  too bad the article does n't explain `` why '' or `` how '' ? 
  you ca n't make the difference between a plan and an objective . 
  the former lead to the later . 
   divide by 2 the number of student in zep 's class  objective  by hiring double the amount of teacher  ** fucking plan ** where is the plan ? 
  hold back your horse , we do n't vote tomorrow and macron has n't even given his program yet . 
  mlp ca n't lose the 2nd run if there is no 2nd round . 
  no it 's not . 
  macron will `` disclose '' his program ealy march . 
  you are the one saying bullshit and getting all wet for a total absence of plan . 
  [ me right now ] ( https://youtu.be/wast139rpco?t=1m10s ), 
   i 'm going to reform nice . 
  how ? 
  how ? 
  this is just plain vague fucking bullshit . 
  just plain classic communication . 
  if they could fabricate its program , i 'd like to know what reddit wants me to vote for . 
  when we will have balls , brain and arms ? 
  it 's so funny to see people try to `` figure out '' russia . 
  you bunch of 20yo kids think you can keep up with some dude who worked kgb for longer than you lived ? 
  russia already won , that 's the beauty of the chess master mind . 
  whoever wins next french election will be a weak president , trust in institution like justice and media is very low , division are huge amongs french . 
   what the fuck happened to `` progressive '' thought read the comment . 
  i said it did n't pass the border . 
  people ? 
  which people ? 
  our people . 
  congratz we got it . 
  it does n't mean that it 's what they are looking for . 
  and you are pushing your value on other , that 's very bad . 
  i do n't understand how people can be so blind . 
  it 's simple . 
  if you want your rules to be respected at home , you follow other people 's rule when you visit . 
  there is no right/wrong/bad / good here . 
  just simple reprocity . 
  our values are n't better , they are different . 
  if this is too hard for you and r/europe to understand , it simply means you are too limited culturaly wise . 
  the swedish government is n't . 
  you can ask anything to those willing to come into/lead your country because you own it . 
  iranian people own iran and the custom make you wear a scarf . 
  you do n't get to say what is disrespectful for iranian . 
  i still expect the foreigners to abide by our rule when they only visit .
