  / u/xbettel , why are you pushing macron so hard ? 
  like you said , you do n't even vote here . 
  also , you source of information is very poor . 
  the race is n't a fourway . 
  melenchon is still in the race , bayrou did not said if he will run , fillon may be replaced/cleaned up by justice/give up . 
  so basicaly , it 's still open to plenty of scenario , but you have to be able to listen to french media to know that . 
  you are a really expert . 
  i just happen to look behind the semantic of the words `` running for president '' . 
  yes , / u/pingurambo , he put is little name on the list of the candidate . 
  you are technically right . 
  happy ? 
  now for those wanting a bit more of info on the context , for those who are n't simpleton ; no , he is n't running for president . 
  one house in my street had subvention only because they had a windows made of `` vitraille '' that was considered historical art . 
  i doubt , the one in charge in france , that master the arcannes of it 's law , did n't manage to get some incentive . 
  but indeed , that 's just assumption on my part . 
  castle maintenance is payed by the state if they are classified as monument . 
  when macron will be taken down , we 'll see if you still hold that . 
  if there is no leader , anarchy takes over . 
  i 'm not fancing a new `` terreur '' area . 
  i merely repeated what all the `` politologue '' stated . 
  if you think you know better than professional , suit yourself . 
  this election is a roller coaster . 
  all the front runner are taken down one by one . 
  just for the poor european jumping into our bottomless political pit . 
  hamon is not running for president , but the lead of the partie socialist ( ps ) . 
  so he address the core of his voter , not the french . 
  those whole like to dream big and then get smashed by the wall of reality . 
  those idea are merely flagship for a vision of france that will never happen . 
  i mean , if it comes down to this , why even keep ireland in the eu ? 
  play by the rule , or get the fuck out . 
  i wish it was that simple for us too . 
  we do n't have any sort of `` special '' relationship . 
  not questioning your experience . 
  i 'm questioning your honesty . 
  my post was pretty clear about it and you would have seen it if you did n't have head up your ass up to the nationalist nerve . 
  i 'm in . 
  it 's been to long since we roasted some british eggs . 
  she played the hand delt to her , a pretty shitty one . 
  she all-in with last early election and it failed . 
  everyone must remember , british put themselves in this position . 
  hottest ladies *, 
  i could report you for supporting nazism . 
  it would be fun to see mods ' take on that . 
  im pretty sur they can make you stop talking by a simple ban . 
  in the mean time i 'll just block you . 
  that will be about the same . 
   you 're never gon na stop people expressing their views . 
  look that just what german 's police did . 
  peace retard, 
  1 / im not saying you are american . 
  i said the argument was . 
  2 / i have full knowledge of history and french/us relation . 
  enough to know that our definition of liberty is very different . 
  3 / you are ** again ** talking about opinion when ** no opinion ** was even mention by anybody . 
  there is no beneficial situation where tolerating demonstration of nazism is acceptable . 
  peace retard . 
  xd yes . 
  calling someone retarded is punishable by law . 
  also , what opinion are you talking about ?!? 
  they did n't express an opinion . 
  those dude did some stupid shit and like we say : do stupid shit , get hits . 
  also , the `` this is a slippery slope , and you do n't want the government taking away people 's freedom like this . '', 
  argument makes my eyes roll so hard . 
  not even worth arguying about that classic bullshit american argument . 
  stop defending stupid statement . 
  germany has historically a particuliar reaction to anything nazi related . 
  you have to be retarded to try to justify what that dude did . 
   you do n't want the government taking away people 's freedom like this muhhh freedoooom . 
  just saying , in my country you can order a [ neger 's head ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%aate-de-n%c3%a8gre_ ( p % c3 % a2tisserie \\ ) ) and that 's the best think to have a bit on . 
  not sur it would be possible in the us though . 
  different country do things differently, 
  fucking / u/lolfish42 killing all the fun for us . 
  they gain from being bigger . 
  by next century china will return to it 's 1st rank and europe will be the second biggest area . 
  i 'm pretty sur you are the one full of shit . 
  you most likely try to make your particular case a generality when it 's clearly is n't . 
  who the fuck is asking himself `` what hospital should i go to ? '', 
  during an ** emergency ** . 
  you realize that if this is true . 
  your kids will be chinese 's slaves . 
  yeah , but thatfact means shit until you draw conclusion from it . 
  and here the ** wrong ** conclusion to make here is the shortcut `` you have higher standard of living in the us '' . 
  you used to have plain full of wilderness , and now this . 
  nobody was into anyone . 
  we just have the chance to have 4 party to chose rather than two like we used to, 
  way more than 50 % came to vote, 
  the media didnt campain against melenchon . 
  you must be mixing him up with fillon, 
  you mix up communism and socialism, 
  yeah , because everyone goes to very particular place like the rambla or the park g\u00fcell . 
  but who gives a fuck about the 95 % of the streets ? 
  nobody , outside the old town , barcelona is ugly as fuck . 
  i lived in barcelona like i wrote a couple post ago . 
  for someone so `` educated '' you sure seems to have either memory or reading problems . 
  you are just taking it in your nationalist nerve , like most catalan usualy do . 
  god forbide you receive a critic !, 
  dude . 
  that 's blocks of concrete . 
  the first turd ever made was still a turd . 
  what ?
