  no answer . 
  lmao , he is part of those who will paralyze the country . 
  fillon is the only one that will get a majority . 
  or that 2 of them are extremist wanting to throw the republic by the window . 
  that 's where uk got it all wrong right from the start . 
  you ca n't graps the very reason your were welcome in the first place . 
  nobody gives a fuck about the small extra # you pour into eu , that was peanuts compare the other benefit your offered . 
   a vision of europe eu is not just a pack of net/deficit contributor . 
  that a terribly shitty way of seeing the world . 
  it 's all a matter of perspective then . 
  so what / u/french _ honhon is saying , is that he just a closed minded intolerant . 
  you realize they all say dumb shit ? 
  i know , but it would have ruined my punchline . 
  even france does n't reach the current standard of integration , i doubt you do any better . 
   and contributes a lot to budget . 
  which is totaly irrelevant , like i already said . 
   remove the variable of this brexit i like how you try to downplay that `` little brexit thing '', 
  obivously , we have different reference/generation . 
  you do n't buy your way into eu . 
  you 'd rather have his 19 % go to mlp ? 
  just saying , those who pay for that shit are also human , on the other side of the union . 
  yes , critic for improvement is welcome . 
  critic for political bullshit game on national level is n't . 
  if people take my tax money , they better not spit at my back after . 
   does he wan na seize the means of the production he does . 
  the populism , alongside the facist . 
  if you want to play hypocrit , i 'm in . 
  if you call m\u00e9lanchon a leftist , call mlp by the same standard , a rightist . 
  if you call her a facist , call him out with the same standard , a communist . 
  m\u00e9lanchon is not leftist . 
  he is communist . 
  you have your french political spectrum fucked up . 
  the one that as always been so low in the poll , nobody ever bother to even investigate . 
  your lack of argument is the only embarrassment here . 
  a shit tons, 
  same voters , same extrem methode , same populist approach , same rethoric , same anti system image , same experience of leardership , same international stance . 
  should i continu ? 
  ffs , i hate that r/europe force me to upvote you out of the negative . 
  yeah right and when merkel will tell him to go fuck himself ( like she did for every single full of hope president before ) , what is he going to do ? 
  you actualy think individual aksed in poll are doing some next level tatic to adjust who goes to the 2nd turn ? 
  mostly in blood and 10 thousands of death . 
  not sur it 's something we can be happy about . 
  they are n't . 
  i 'm so sad the fucking italian got this beauty before us . 
  what a shame . 
  [ when you are the only country in all the top `` against '' category ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwbul7ot9sa ), 
  if i had to blow 360 million on a boat , it sur as fuck would have more than 5 windows . 
  loulan fait plus de boulot que l'office du tourisme de france . 
  everyone in france living for politic/by politic think she is under evaluated because we ca n't establish the amount of abstention . 
  her father was here 30 years ago , and her niece ( deputy of vaucluse ) is 27 year old . 
  they have eaten defeat more than everyone in politic and they are still around . 
  bull . 
  shit . 
  xbettel , do you have any idea of what you are talking about ? 
  like , the le pen have been around for 40 years already , and the youngest and most extreme ( in politic ) of this family is 25 . 
   socialism has n't been on the political spectrum since 1986 what is hollande ? 
  what is the ps ? 
  it 's not because you do n't govern , or govern like shit , that you are off the political spectrum . 
  with the future cluster fuck that will be the parliament , getting more than 15 seats out of 500 should be a piece of cake for the arguably 1st party of france . 
  she is not present at the moment only because we do n't have a proportional system . 
  thing that will be changed if macron wins . 
  if she is n't getting them now , she will at the next legislative . 
  you are making a reminder for 2022 ? 
  or the legislative ? 
  if the modem can have a group , the fn will have his . 
  something positive about the boogeyman . 
  regardless of his view points , his post was still 100x more interesting than the shitty meme , circle jerck of this thread . 
  almost none of the post of this thread is worth anything beside maybe the first of / u/stevenfries . 
  none engage a proper discussion . 
  except the one that he has now delete . 
   i do n't think it paints anywhere near the full picture . 
  i do n't think anybody here is qualify to answer that question considering the inexistant number of both french & adult on reddit . 
  once again , your comment shows how trash reddit system is . 
  downvoted for telling an unpopular thruth . 
  sorry to break it to you but mlp will most likely be the main opposition party . 
  she is here for a very long time . 
  she will only win power in this election , even if she fails to reach the elys\u00e9e . 
  she will have a group at the parliament . 
  you guys can thanks macron for that . 
  we trade socialist <  liberal spectrum for a globalist <  nationalist one . 
  if macron fails , she will win 2022 's election . 
  the men meant class . 
  aside from your first wrong assumption , you still do n't get it . 
  it 's not about `` spotting '' , it 's about getting the ** identity ** . 
  you missed that part  to be able to identify, 
  lmao , wow , the sorrow loser . 
  ca n't even admit when you fail . 
  w/e suits your little world . 
   so it has n't always been the same . 
  did i say it was the case ? 
  so ... yeah , i do n't know what else to tell you beside that your attempt are embarassing . 
  my orginal post was made as a taunt and this looks like a complete success . 
   used to yeah on the first draft , for 4 years before it was definitly changed . 
   history is n't their job , mate . 
  that does n't seems to be yours either . 
  yeah , cia does n't know shit . 
  worse intelligence agency .
