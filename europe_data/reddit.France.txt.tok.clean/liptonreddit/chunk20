  so either op is wrong , either :  actually a pretty sad thing to say about america and its culture . 
  i know you like living in a dream , but as some point , you need to face reality . 
  my point being , it 's wrong to say `` us has higher wages & better life style '' simply because you take the average income . 
  the disparity is so huge that there is a 90 % you are part of the people that will be paid with peanuts ; while the other 10 % will bring up the data . 
  that 's the `` winner takes it all '' approach of the usa . 
  now , concerning the life style part , i 'd rather avoid going further on it because me and my italian friend would shit on that pretty hard . 
  that 's actually a pretty sad thing to say about america and its culture . 
   taxes/wages/lifestyle , let 's be honest , the us has much more interesting places than germany and you earn more before and obviously also after taxes . 
  totaly disagree on that . 
  you take the ( very ) sucessfull example within the us and do n't mention the just good/average that are struggling to make it to next month . 
  it 's great to live in the us , if you are part of the wealthy , the other are fucked . 
  also you compare germany and the us , when you should compare europe vs us . 
  in this case , i 'm fairly positive that we have more interesting places than the us . 
  they are having such great holidays . 
  demand  supply . 
  since you are not going for a highest biding system because that would be retarded , you just transfer the problem . 
  you still have a first come , first served . 
  except now it 's at the desk rather than by the pool . 
  why do n't you just steal the towel ? 
  are you for real ? 
  the way you twist history to cast a `` good/bad '' light on ** either side ** is disgusting . 
  next you 're going to defend those * `` poor aryan just trying to improve humanity 's gene pool by opting out the jew and handicaped . 
  that 's like asking a french if he prefers the spanish or the brits . 
  that 's pretty impressive that uk remains in the top 3 with a church more than 5 centuries old . 
   kiwi here with recent german ancestry . 
  you mean a double dose of salt ? 
  france is 3/0 .5 this past century against you . 
  bye the way , thanks for the 8 of may . 
  love that national holiday ( was a monday this year ), 
  there is a huge difference between fighting nazi on their front and liberating france . 
  anyway , nice godwin . 
  99 % of people with absolutely no power to acheive anything . 
  no matter how mad you are because we did as we pleased it does n't change the reality . 
  strong country will fuck up small one as they please . 
  if you are going to be frustrated , you should be at your own weakness . 
  it said that because it was partialy failed . 
  not because it was a bad idea . 
  we are doing operation of sabotage all the time , we just do n't get caught . 
  i take it you got the message . 
  now go on . 
  i do know that we sink that ship in foreign area because it was more convenient for us and less risky for the crew . 
   does n't mean you can just straight sink any ship which goes there ? 
  yes it does . 
  it says you have to abide by the law of the country , our laws . 
  if you enter a top secret area , you bet your ass we can sink the ship like we please . 
  also , there is no such thing as friendly country . 
  we paid 10 million to clear this out and that 's it . 
  the reality is that we 'd rather not be enemy with nz , but we do n't give much of a fuck if we were either . 
  lmao , let 's watch this never happen . 
  oh shit i see the godwin coming . 
  haha . 
  carefull not to drown in all that salt, 
  i said it multiple times . 
  we do not give a single fuck of what the nz want . 
  if it was to terrorize the local i would actualy be pissed because thats a lame ans uneffective op\u00e9ration . 
  i dont understand how you can actualy imagine that the law of the sea applies to a nuclear test site . 
  also like said elsewhere , it would have been too much of a pain to justify a whole crew irradiated . 
  french gov went for the lesser evil . 
  holyshit , you have no idea of what the story is about . 
  why the fuck would france try to scare nz . 
  we gave no fuck about them even when they brought us to international court . 
  we wanted to sink the rw to block activist in their attempt to mess with our military test . 
  if we really wanted to scare them we would have just sunk all of them once they enter our sea . 
  period . 
  soviet liberated france . 
  that 's new . 
  you might want to invest in history or geography books, 
  you do nothing because you ca n't make it otherwise . 
  grow a pair , you or your country and then we 'll see . 
  and what political claim has a secret service operation ? 
  you think france would have claimed the operation ?!, 
  use your brain if you can . 
  then do it , if you can . 
  things is , you ca n't . 
  what they did was sabotage . 
  not terrorism . 
  you have no idea what those words mean beside ( maybe ) their literal definition, 
  you understanding is wrong . 
  our president ordered the operation . 
  did you see even the slighest proces ? 
  you know why ? 
  because in our constitution , the president is above the law . 
  period . 
   they are not even committing a crime . 
  illegaly entering a foreign top secret military complex . 
  well sorry but for the one judging , it 's a crime . 
  * for all french . 
  true , we could have just torpedoed it in french water . 
  it would have been legaly and technicaly more efficient . 
  we do n't give a fuck of the right to protest of citizen that are n't french , especially when they want to express it illegaly on foreign ground , ours . 
  the right to protest in france is given to the citizen of ** france ** . 
  the other can all go fuck off . 
  my country is just as pleasant as ever . 
  we do n't a fuck about neither heaven nor your moral . 
  i do n't know . 
  there is a large chance we rekt one of your ancestor and we are still farming salt centuries later . 
  you should have done something about it . 
  if you could . 
  but you ca n't . 
  just like netherlands with mh-17 .
