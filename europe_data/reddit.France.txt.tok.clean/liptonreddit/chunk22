  dude , 2002 was 15 years ago . 
  the world had gay mariage only in denmark at that time . 
  and even 200k was n't much . 
  anyway , we agree that only lunatic would question the right of abortion in france . 
  my comment was n't meant to be as absolute as that . 
  looking for chirsitine boutin is looking for the 0.3 % of french pop . 
  you are not going to find a single french that will agree with you . 
  just your regular badass french women . 
  it means he gots dem nukes . 
  are you on drugs ?

  i never said it was always the case . 
  the world is n't black or white . 
  at all . 
  corporation abide by our rules . 
  we set the rules/objectives and we are partner in crime if we do nothing while they break those rules . 
  if germany is going to stay in paris agreement , while backing up the use of coal & company that lie/cheat on polution test . 
  i 'd rather have not being hypocrit and out of it . 
  ** that is not what they are doing ** , mostly because the us call them out of it . 
  good . 
  hopefully carlos ghosn would join them soon . 
  we not extrading anyone either . 
  but the us is right when they call us out when we are cheating . 
  ca n't blame them for leaving paris agreement then falsify polution report . 
  almost none of the french car respect the regulation and are covered by the minister of environment ( s\u00e9gol\u00e8ne royale ) . 
  it 's just a world stage competition of hypocrits . 
  everyone is fighting for its own industry . 
  oh men , you completely missed it . 
  i 'll try to make it even more simple . 
  supermarket = pick & pay . 
  eu is no supermarket . 
  eu is your local small shop where you have to talk about the last gossip of the vilage with the owner . 
  [ islamist be like ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/042/619/4ea.jpg ), 
  italian brooooo, 
  its up to you to pressure those who need to be !, 
  a small '' you better not fuck around with this because i 'll be watching '' can make wonders . 
  asking for the real sex equality . 
  every company that has a dress code ban them . 
  stop wasting internet space please . 
  that makes such a massive difference . 
  ( imo ) he is a diva . 
  he does n't want to rule , reform and improve anything . 
  he just want people to talk about him . 
  all those drama are like christmas . 
  govern is hard and ungratefull . 
  shit talk and complain is easy though . 
  that is what bayrou likes to do the most . 
  you have a twisted and biased view of reality . 
  you take your opinion for fact ( cf : * '' 99 % of countries on earth would have entered civil war under those circumstances '' * ) . 
  if you think the nation revenu was n't shared properly , ** why did n't you vote ** to fix this ? 
  if you think your politician were corrupted , ** why did n't you vote ** to fix this ? 
  if you think your growing deficit was a problem , ** why did n't you vote ** to fix this ? 
  that 's not french , us or who ever 's fault but yours . 
  bayrou was liked because he was the only known politician of the survey with no responsability . 
  french dig their past politics . 
  it 's a tradition after the legislative to resign the whole government and fix what needs to be . 
  it just happen previously nothing was fixed . 
  the irony of someone making 7 words post and calling out others for there `` very simplistic '' post . 
  are you kidding ? 
  you litteraly swam in uk/france/germany 's money for 30 years and you want me to pity you for 5 years of austerity and reform ? 
   i ca n't vote out the elite and what did we just do ? 
  we just kicked out every single politician that was working the last 5 years . 
  but you ca n't ? 
  that 's pathetic to keep putting on others your faults . 
  grow a pair . 
  that 's where your problem lies . 
  you do n't understand balance . 
  you think that because ** your ** own self personal balance is fine it means you are not responsible . 
  you do n't understand that when your country has a fuckton of decifit , an unstable economy only base on tourism , that also mean , ** you ** have deficit/problem . 
   what about you and your buddies ? 
  i know that i own 54k $ of national debt just for being french and that 's why i 'm voting everything that would me us reform to fix that through austerity or reform . 
  and if the time comes where people ask us to pay back , i wo n't be putting the blame on other . 
  france is fucking up and will have to pay too ( in time ) . 
  moraly wrong , but technicaly right . 
  it 's always the fault of others right ? 
  never yours . 
  that 's someone else fault if the country was runned for 30 years by a bunch of corrupted monkey swimming in eu 's money . 
  do n't abuse other people 's money and you wo n't be brutalized . 
  he will be worse outside of it . 
  now he does n't have a reason to hold back . 
  between the lepen/m \u00e9luch / bayrou/wauquiez , it 's going to be a pain to watch politics . 
  andora we are sorry , we forgot you . 
  you posted 8 times . 
  my guess is that you are on a windowsphone and spammed that submit button . 
  it 's sad to see that budget cut affected the artist . 
  he had to go straight to the essential . 
  op is french . 
  this explains that . 
   oh , and who invented those machines ? 
  who extracted the materials to build them , who engineered them , who programmed them , who maintains them and who runs the electricity producing methods on which they are run ? 
  people and capital . 
  i do n't mind the first one . 
  it 's suit the balance of both flag . 
  also , this set up would work on most eu 's country flag . 
  i did n't even watch , thinking `` there is no way we actually make it to the top 150 '' . 
  if la poste is the 2nd best , god i ca n't even imagine what the others have . 
  you have a middle school knowledge of economic . 
  worker does n't produce all the wealth . 
  they actually produce less and less of it with the growing automation . 
  there is more than just economy in a program .
