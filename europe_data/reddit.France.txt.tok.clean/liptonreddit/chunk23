  education for instance . 
  with that much salt and vinegar , it 's a good thing you stay home . 
  you pick extreme example to draw dramatic conclusion . 
  the reality is very different and far more complex . 
  did you copy that comment from facebook or youtube ? 
  while it 's true the mecanic you describe is a thing , let 's not suggest the police is just * pretending to work * to appease people . 
  so far , most of the terrorist were known by the police . 
  the ** department of justice ** / laws ** is ** / are what the one holding back the police to act . 
  i 'd rather give helmut kohl the funeral he decided , rather than what junker wants . 
  if they are the same , then why not ? 
  he is a respected figure for us too . 
  the hacking was n't from russia our secret service says ( conviniently after the election ) and politic get fund where they can . 
  russia is n't better/worse than the blood diamond in africa . 
  it 's not a direct democracy . 
  it does n't mean it is n't a democracy . 
  they still have the power to make you look like shit . 
  yeah , i think that should be a lesson for those countries not to interfere with other countries ' problem . 
  by the way , about that russian thing , have fun !, 
  no we did n't and we also had to pay russia compensation for not delivering . 
  everybody ? 
  we ai n't on that train . 
  i ca n't wait for wwiii to finaly start so we can get over it . 
  those sanction hit france 's agriculture and cost the sale + sanction of two ships but our public opinon was favorable for it . 
  i do n't assume they had too much to do to convince hollande . 
  all french party have a relation with russia . 
  that 's not viewed as a problem here . 
  just like '' [ insert any candidate that is n't macro ] is pro putin and back by the kremlin '' . 
  this is simple partisan bullshit . 
  yeah , i just would n't be satisfied with that . 
  we did n't kick gaddafi out . 
  lybanian did . 
  we were very happy with him exactly for this reason . 
  it 's pretty perfect right now in france . 
  omg , even frenchies ca n't burn brits like that . 
  i do n't doub your cellphone display 3g . 
  but there is a massive difference between what is displayed and the real speed . 
  3mbit/s north of finland , is just an obvious bullshit . 
  this map by an independant source shows [ the 4g in france . 
  ] ( http://fr.sensorly.com/map/4g/fr/france/sfr/lte_20810# | coverage ) it shows that there is a massive difference if you look into details . 
  the reddit 's map is just a stupid dickwaving contest . 
  because you do ? 
  wow , we have an expert in finnish network right here !, 
  first , it 's `` cr\u00e9tin '' . 
  2nd : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gz5en/how_many_lte_gigabytes_30_buys_despite_euwide/diui8a8/ 3rd : you have to either completely stupid or naive to believe map provided by the provider are accurate . 
  our country is so superior . 
  people glued to their cellphone screen all day . 
  feels good to be living in zombi land . 
  2km , i say it could be worth a try . 
  while skiing i often stay on my operator while in italian ( soon to be french ) montains, 
  https://elisa.fi/kuuluvuus/ this map shows that half the country is n't covered . 
  and it 's provided by a bias source . 
  aside from the fact it 's not 97 % coverage of the landmass ( like some claim it to be ) we 've got map like this too and they are bullshit since provided by operator as marketing tool . 
  you 're telling me that [ this place ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/search/chirac+lepen/@67.7903875,25.4809261,3a,75y,290.09h,96.65t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1szhkwjr1mehtbfznzje7kzw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dzhkwjr1mehtbfznzje7kzw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d319.07086%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656 ) has 3mbit coverage ? 
  because the map is bullshit . 
  i doubt you even have a signal north of finland . 
  easy bitches . 
  also , stay off the rift with your peasant internet . 
  will they even have the toilet capacity ? 
  cry me a river, 
  `` french return '' . 
  the exact title should have been `` half of french '' . 
  any of the two involved ? 
  you can probably buy it if you add a cheese cake on top of your list . 
  can you swim in that river or is this radioactive like the seine of paris ? 
  debated with a friend . 
  this street could potentially be amoung the best place to live in the world ( ratio standard of living of country/price/position / attraction/architecture ), 
  regardless of your opinion , dude is on topic . 
  the 65 idiots who downvoted him are just proving him right . 
  playing the dumbass i see . 
  you should just leave it to those equipped with more ... logic than you . 
  [ ok . ] ( https://imgflip.com/s/meme/captain-picard-facepalm.jpg ), 
  * `` police does n't prevent felony , so i suggest we should stop having a police !, 
  just like firefighter !, 
  we still have fire anyway . 
  we should stop funding them '' * - / u/avenflar, 
  you can always hear voice saying everything and it 's oposite . 
  it does n't matter wtf some idiot on internet says about the state of emergency . 
  there are people dealing with that . 
  competent people . 
   we had attacks during it , which proves they are right . 
  wtf is that logic ? 
  never pretended that it will stop 100 % of the attack . 
  but even if it stop 10 % of them it will already be worth it . 
  you do n't see the problem with candidate being investigated during the campaing by the philosophic mentor of one of the candidate ? 
  mostly because french do n't give much of a fuck about reddit . 
  geez , we were only missing the american that still managed to talk about themselves in a thread about france on the european reddit . 
  facepalm . 
  wtf you think everyone is doing ? 
  you think that french are just sitting on their ass , masturbating at our greatness ? 
  if you have a solution to defeat isis , stop local terrorism & bring soclail peace , we are all hear . 
  good thing you can vote against it next sunday . 
  you will realize you are pretty much alone in your case . 
  exactly . 
  what 's for sur , is that they will never know what press looked like before title become edited clickbait . 
  because that does n't need to be said . 
  german would be thrust worthy / reliable even if they do n't wanted to . 
  they have more thrust in france than french, 
  i mean , her boobs are n't really standing up either . 
  what 's the point of asking this ? 
  the uk really do like its political shit show .
