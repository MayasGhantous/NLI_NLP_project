   voc flag the flag of the company was ** orange ** , white , and blue ( see dutch flag ) , with the company logo embroidered on it . 
  [ ok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_east_india_company#company_name.2c_logo_and_flag ) after about 1630 , the orange band tended to be replaced by a red one , as indicated by paintings of that time . 
  the cia factbook suggests that this was merely due to the orange dye used tending to fade to red over time also the color is different . 
  what you are refering too is [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/statenvlag.svg/220px-statenvlag.svg.png ) . 
  the blue is not your current color nor the one used in the comic . 
  to finish , this was merely a joke . 
  you do n't need to be triggered over it . 
  both flag have completely different source of inspiration . 
  designed in 1813 as a variant of the older orange-white-blue prinsenvlag, 
  scotland has the nukes , so it 's would be pretty short . 
  where is the prequel with the french flag ? 
  pretty sur you do that yourself well enough . 
  she is bluffing because she knows eu will bully her over it . 
  you ca n't blame your politician for attempting to save your assets . 
  piss of brits and give us leverage on them ? 
  you guys are beginners in this discipline . 
  leave it to the french . 
  building wall is pretty hype right now . 
  i do n't think uk/usa have moral lesson to give regarding wall construction . 
  if gibraltar belongs to uk , a hard border should be on the table without any taboo . 
   each people has to manifest its will to adhere . 
  there was , from 1958 up to 1998 . 
  40 years settle that question . 
   this seems to refer to autonomy and not specifically independence . 
  but france is only `` taking care of this peoples '' which suggests that this is a temporary condition , or at least not an eternal one . 
  this is pure interpretation from you . 
  i read , that they are not a colony but a part of france ( equal to mainland in right ) . 
   why would the law precise the `` concerned '' populations ? 
  to warrant a right of regard concerning their future and that it 's not only the metropole that will decide . 
  it does n't mean , they have the reverse power to decide , without the agreement of the metropole . 
   far more brilliant legal minds than me have argued both sides of this case and they arrived to the same conclusion as me . 
  it 's not a matter of brightness but public opinion . 
  is public opinion ok to lose part of this territory ? 
  i give no fuck about what some ps loser decided by himself 20 years ago . 
  if the public opinion take ahold of this , the noum\u00e9a agreement will be worth shit . 
  i did n't vote for jospin , he was n't elected for this . 
  this is worth nothing . 
  wtf are you talking about . 
  there is no `` acceptable '' scaling of land appropriation . 
  either you take it either you do n't . 
  there is no gentle way to take away a land mass . 
  spain judge portugal land was n't worth fighting/dying for anymore and gave it away/let you have it . 
  uk is thinking that scotland is n't worth fighting for and will let go of it . 
  and at the contrary , you have ukraine and crimea . 
  how much approval are we given to crimea 's independance . 
  i do n't have time to dig into what happened between portugal and spain , but either you asked for independance and they did n't fight back against ( giving approval ) either you took it by force . 
  it says they can administrate themselve and be part of france 's institution . 
  not that they can uniliteraly decide their independance . 
  there is huge legal difference . 
  '' population interess\u00e9 = population that owns the island , in other word , french people , not local . 
  says that where ? 
  for nc , it 's a jospin on drug that allowed the noumea agreement . 
  yeah no . 
  you do n't decide uniteraly to take your `` independance '' . 
  nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie belongs to the french people , not the local . 
  you actually believe europe 's politic is decided in brussel ? 
  scarjo as major kusanagi is the real offense . 
  just like the other ugly as beaut with the beast . 
  it 's a president , not an emperor . 
  wtf are you saying . 
  sorry , we do n't take immigrant anymore . 
  yes really . 
  i 'm telling you just in case you ca n't process that i 'm not living in paris and your assumption was stupid . 
  there are other cities/region than paris in france . 
  like normandie . 
  how do you conquer a country equipped of nukes ? 
  fuuuck , my bad . 
  how could i do such a mistake . 
  for my defense , they are usualy hiden behind a shitload of smog , i do n't see that far . 
  grow up . 
  we interfer in everyone 's election just as much . 
  we put half the dictator of africa ourselves . 
  france never saw russia like usa , germany & ex-urss countries do . 
  russia never engaged a direct war with us , ( quite the opposite in fact ) . 
  a huge part of our agrictulture is fucked because we ca n't export to russia , and guess who is voting fn ? 
  farmers . 
  russia is seen as a threat just as much as the us . 
  this is bullshit title . 
  everyone is involved in our election . 
  when merkel receive macron/fillon but not the 9 other , she is somewhat involving herself in the campaign ( by giving international status ) . 
  people that are `` shocked '' are either too young , or too naive about politic . 
  upvoting you . 
  piss one brits a day , keeps the island away . 
  hello germany . 
  look at us fucking it all up . 
  see you in 25 days . 
  hire a hitman ? 
  union of kingdom * ftfy, 
  what is missing ? 
  everything worthy is in it 's rightfull place . 
  french have no idea what tatcher did . 
  people are calling him that , simply because he himself mentioned his respect for the way she held the leadership through reform . 
  that has nothing to do with said quality of her reform , just the way she stood still within the storm . 
  really ? 
  what happened ? 
  this is what ad revenu base journalism as turned journalism into . 
  who pays for it 's news today ? 
  if people are n't ready to pay , then they will get cheapbait product . 
  ( this applies to ** any ** free cultural product ), 
  im arguing that french people is a mass of sheep that change their mind like freaking toddlers .
