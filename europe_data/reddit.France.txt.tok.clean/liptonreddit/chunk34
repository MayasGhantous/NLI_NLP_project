  they can get the fuck out , but they ai n't keeping the living room/kitchen with them . 
  da fuck are you talking about . 
  im adressing a message to one particular guys and you take it like i 'm adressing everyone . 
  shit , learn . 
  read . 
  what do you mean ? 
  algeria never was france . 
  obviously your study 's subject is n't on the respect of other 's opinion . 
  maybe you should have started by that . 
   so no ... we wo n't be talking  i did n't say we 'll talk about the subject of the doctorate . 
  maybe stop doing math and actualy start some literature , or at least , some listening . 
  what world of denial are you living in ? 
  why bring up ukraine ? 
  they are pissed because they feel we turned into pussies where you ca n't even call out facts and reality without hurting 30 association 's sensibility . 
  basicaly , what the us is experiencing with trump and got him elected . 
  people are scared that mlp win this election , but do n't worry . 
  she will run in 2022 . 
   by the way a lot of muslims are perfectly integrated , hold jobs , eat baguettes , bref , are fine french citizens . 
  and that should not be forgotten . 
  can you get the clich\u00e9 out of your ass ? 
  that 's not being french . 
   68ers we all did n't mould together that 's what happen when your morality goes beyond reality . 
  like vegan giving salad to their dog , people push morality regardless of practicability . 
  the current shitshow is the result . 
  are you guys for real ? 
  i could name two countries out of eu ( soon ) that have for tradition/2nd nature to be at war . 
  they are n't thinking that . 
  / u/batard-sensible is bullshiting . 
  they are just adapting the song to the thematic that suits them . 
  people gave no fuck about foreigner back when that song was written .

  i doubt you would have said that if he was banging a girl with 30 years less than him . 
  you know , trump style . 
  also , he is looked into for hiding part of his fortune . 
  france is n't in danger ? 
  you need another dude running a truck into a crowed, 
  that 's where your problem is . 
  even in your dictionary , your notion of nation is fucked up . 
  i can give you 5 dictionnary in french and none will agree with your definition . 
  tu dis que tu es fran\u00e7ais , mais tu comprends pas quand on te dis de la fermer apparemment . 
  that 's what happens when you let brits toy with french language . 
  cf : `` intelligible '', 
  culture rise and fall all the time . 
  are you crying for the man of tautavel ? 
  you probably do n't give a fuck , just like i do . 
  ... are ** moraly ** justifiable . 
  do n't skip words . 
  that still would make it illegal . 
  helping a economic migrant reach europe is a prime example , but like i said , thanks god , morality ai n't running a country . 
  what is working ? 
  every actual nation . 
  exactly . 
  that 's a big land .

   article 1 constitution  la france est une r\u00e9publique indivisible 5 first words of the constitution . 
  so yeah , undivisible before . 
  of course , paris ai n't fucking around like madrid does . 
   every people have a right to self-determination you realize we are not talking about people here right ? 
  do you think france would let go of lyon ? 
  who would actualy step into that shitshow ? 
   it 's just a fact that the rule of law is enforced like that welcome to real life . 
  you talk a lot about history , you might want to check one thing or two about mankind and land sovereignty . 
  cataluna is not a fucking nation . 
  just like the land of cataluna belongs to the spanish people ( all of them ), 
  not really . 
  `` deemed inappropriate '' is always up to the one making the judgement . 
  i consider the us love of weapon inappropriate , but saying i 'm right and they are wrong to be over weaponized is foolish . 
  you talk about slave and feel good we abolished them , what about animal slavery ? 
  are you ready to become vegan ? 
  coz i 'm fucking not . 
  i 'd rather be the immoral . 
  why do you mix legal and moral ? 
  morality does n't rule a country . 
  why the fuck do you even have a 1km \u00b2 in spain ? 
  we did n't clean you off properly from the continent !, 
  are you serious right now . 
  are you discovering the world of political communication ? 
  and why is that ? 
  of fucking course they do as she ask . 
  she set the rule ; if tf1 is not happy , they can refuse to receive her . 
  t'es entrain de me dire que quand tu t ` exprimes au naturel , tu donnes l'impression de chialer ? 
  sad to see reddit downvote that post, 
  you might want to look at our country . 
  i 've waisted enough time with your hypocrisy . 
  keep dicking around with your understanding of this article , so long that you pay what you fucking own ( and in silence ), 
   accuse . 
  not blame . 
  so the same . 
   to read a fucking article yeah and i 've gone further . 
  called the article bullshit . 
  you want me to shed a tear for 8 years of fixing the shit they should have done by themselves after cashing on 40 years of european money ? 
  hell no . 
   the point of the article is to showcase that imf made money on the crisis . 
  the point of the article is to ** blame ** imf for making money on greek crisis . 
  the article writer blame the doctor for getting rich on the patient being dumb enough to run naked under the rain . 
  here we go . 
  you completely missed the metaphore and excuse me , but if this article is n't a scud sent to the imf , i do n't know what it is . 
  last i check , mlp was n't calling back segregation either .
