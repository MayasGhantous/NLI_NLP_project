  start an investigation is already a campaign killing act . 
  what if in 3 month the judge come to the conclusion there was nothing ? 
  * `` oh sorry mr fillon , we killed your chance to be president but hey , shit happens . 
  '' * give me a fucking break . 
  you guys are ludicrous . 
  you did your homework . 
  good . 
  now you only have the whole algeria war to review . 
  then you 'll know what you are talking about . 
  fillon is n't far . 
  fillon is just at what the right normaly is . 
  sarkozy is right wing of rp while jupp\u00e9 was left . 
  fillon is just right . 
   some of his policies are right-wing , yes just like some of mlp 's policies are left . 
  that does n't make her a left candidate . 
  who is running for macron ? 
  i did n't see sarkozy , raffarin or estrosi . 
  i saw some very popular leftist though . 
  good one . 
  people could vote for mam , guaino or yade for the right . 
  but lets be real . 
   i strongly disagree , if there is strong suspicion that a candidate broke the law i want to know about it before i vote for them so judge can decide who can run . 
  that 's called a dictatorship . 
  corruption spare nobody . 
  politics faking jobs , cops puting weapons into people 's butt , judge calling out and revealing affaire in the press that later falls flat . 
  that 's not naivety at this point , when you entrust a country 's direction only to a couple of non elected people . 
  that 's stupidity . 
  the 20 % still favorable to him in the poll do n't give a shit . 
  power corrupt . 
  if you are white in french politic it means you have no experience with power . 
  the press / judge / always try to snipe candidate willing to do reform . 
  woerth got his thrown in the pitt of hell when he tried to reform the pension . 
  his reformed passed and his named was cleared by the trial but of course , nobody talked about it . 
  it does n't sell paper well . 
  the election will be reported . 
  every politician are alone on their market segment . 
  if you are communist , who do you vote for ? 
  you only have melenchon . 
  it 's the same for every candidate . 
  you still do n't get it . 
  the justice is going to block 47 % of the voter 's candidate to run for the election . 
  wtf you think is going to happen when half the country will be robbed of their candidate 2 month before the end of it . 
  that 's what you call a democracy ? 
  only a facist states would block/ruin image of candidate during election time . 
  the judge will continue the investigation and the parliament will remove her immunity if there is enough proof . 
  what is terrible is how stupid eu is . 
  they are being played by mlp easily . 
  the parliament just lifted her immunity . 
  what will 30 % of france voting for her think now , beside that `` the eu parliament is a partial mafia doing anything to gun her down '' . 
  the anti-eu sentiment will just keep rising . 
  mlp has all her life . 
  she can run in 2023 , no problem . 
  people think that once the election are past , everything will come back to normal . 
  the hell it will . 
  the 30 % voter that think they got robbed of their election will be fucking pissed . 
  just like democrat are right now in the us . 
  the whole country will be too busy fighting each other to do anything outside . 
  divide to reign , it 's the basic in war . 
  a war putin , xi ping are winning easy . 
   she broke the law she is suspected . 
  i know you guys are n't jurist but there is a difference called the presumption of innocence , so please start by respecting this constitutional right first before asking for other to respect the law . 
  the investigation is still running and she will get what she deserve in time . 
  but you ca n't allow judge to start an investigation and throw someone straight up into jail/prevent her for running because a judge feels like it , without proof . 
  almost nobody is french here . 
  they could voice their opinion for their entire life time , it would n't matter on this subject . 
   macron is progressive center right and hammon is progressive left . 
  macron is center left , close the valls 's line . 
  i 'm not asking how you see things . 
  i 'm telling you how we see them . 
  we do n't give a fuck about the opinion of others and the consequence that our election will have for them . 
  it is ** never ** mentioned . 
  it is ** never ** debated . 
  it has ** never ** been taken into consideration so far during this campain . 
  that 's somewhat different because yours tryied to straight up pass a law to allow `` small '' missuse of public money . 
  ours is more general and need to avoid elected representant under pressure of external power judge/police within the republic . 
  it 's a simple separation of power that is somewhat abused . 
  your political mapping is shit . 
  if he is center right at best , you are going to say you 'd even put him right ? 
  where is fillon ? 
  did the mayor of lyon tear his ps card and became rp ? 
  macron is n't even endorsed by the udi . 
  he is center left . 
  you can , summon / u/xbettel saying you 've got nudes of macron , he 'll beg for them in pm , then press `` block user '' under his name, 
  you realize french do n't vote to make you feel safe ? 
  your concerns are n't taken into consideration . 
  nice press we got here . 
  like reddit is any better . 
  the same stupid shit are repeated on twitter and here . 
  in your micro bubble maybe , the rest of french call this a constitutional crisis when the judicial interfer with the politics . 
  anyway , whoever wins this shitty election , he will reign over dust and grudge . 
  you guys think you are fighting to prevent puttin 's victory ? 
  france is more devided than ever and he has already won . 
   idk how that does n't fall under the definition of `` crime against humanity '' because that 's not what crime against humanity is . 
  read a fucking definition before going full peace & love keyboard warrior . 
  you do n't know wtf you are talking about , you compare two totaly different thing . 
  you do n't know what defines a `` crime against humanity '' . 
  so why are you running your mouth ? 
  educate yourself , then you 'll be able to talk . 
  i 've seen some retarded thing around here , but that has to be near worse of the worse . 
  the naivety of the 15/25 generation is embarassing .
