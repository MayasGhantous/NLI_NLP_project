  the issue is where do you draw the line ? 
  why do you compare a district of paris with a full city like monaco ? 
  you could also take a high residential building , and divide its number of residents with its surface area , you 'd get a crazy number . 
  paris has a much higher population density than other european capitals , because it kept its ( small ) historic borders , for instance ... 
  it does n't mean it 's * that * dense . 
  edit : ugly typo, 
  you probably just disabled thumbnails globally in your reddit settings . 
  [ i see a lot of thumbnails on the / r/europe page ... actually this submission is one of the only ones that does n't have one . 
  yes ? 
  that is n't true at all . 
  [ i posted another map a few minutes before that one on the same subreddit , and it has a thumbnail . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1eoqtw/population_density_in_europe/ ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  i do n't like the colors in their new maps , i find them way less readable . 
  how comes reddit does n't generate thumbnails sometimes ? 
  it 's really annoying .

  welcome to the party germany and britain !, 
  we lost every single year for the past 36 years because , well , everybody hates us . 
  nah , just kidding , our contestants suck too . 
  actually , studies show that there are less accident on unlit highways ... 
  i disagree , [ it 's very well correlated with population density ] ( http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5004/5351278565_445fcbb249_b.jpg ) . 
  the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) is very apparent . 
  northern italy and belgium are part of the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) . 
  this is all a matter of population density ... 
  honestly given how shitty the eurovision is , i 'm pretty sure the lower you are the better it is :p, 
  who cares , it happened centuries ago ? 
  we can also cry over latin . 
  it 's not regional languages at this point , it 's dead languages . 
  come on , they 're all dead . 
  this exactly . 
  the population of the us in 1770 was 2,148,076 , i.e. 
  basically the population of latvia now ... 
  i disagree . 
  interesting how you got a downvote for this . 
  it seems that a lot of people on this subreddit * really * want to believe there are a lot of occitan speakers . 
   in the south east , i believe that the public tv france 3 has a few programs in proven\u00e7al . 
  we do have it , yes !, 
  but it 's completely artificial , it 's like when they add breton classes in school . 
  the people who speak in france 3 proven\u00e7al are not native speakers , they are passionate people who learned proven\u00e7al and make a few tv shows . 
  it 's fun to watch though ( they subtitle it in french , of course ) . 
  these things are pretty funny , it 's like how they add the proven\u00e7al names of streets on street signs in nice even though nobody uses them . 
  it 's for the * couleur locale * . 
   even english is still diverging : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_cities_shift this is more about accents than dialects . 
  there is no proof whatsoever this translates into emerging dialects . 
   dialect levelling occurs within numerous languages : [ 2 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect_leveling `` dialect levelling or dialect leveling refers to the assimilation , mixture and/or eradication of certain dialects , often due to language standardisation '' . 
  this is the exact opposite of what you 're trying to prove . 
   linguists really do n't think constant media and communication has that much of an effect on language . 
  a nice book to read is dialects in contact by peter trudgill  here 's how a really informed linguist thinks american english will change over the next millennium : http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/futurese.html argument from authority much ? 
  two linguists think one thing , yes . 
  others think the opposite . 
  what does it prove ? 
   / r/linguistics if you want to learn . 
  i 've been on / r/linguistics for years , thank you very much . 
   please learn :-d that 's very smug for a random set of links that mostly prove that you ca n't think on your own . 
   think of how english differs in different regions of the world . 
  that does n't sound like a convincing argument at all . 
  english was different in different regions of the world before globalization . 
  have the differences between local versions of english * increased * in the past century ? 
  i find that hard to believe , it 's probably the opposite . 
   arabic has a written standard - msa - but the spoken versions are very different from one another . 
  same thing here , these versions split before globalization . 
  i doubt that if you take , say , tunisian arabic , it 's going to split into two different languages over the course of the next century . 
   dialects will continue to form even in today 's interconnected world . 
  do you have any examples of dialects that appeared recently ? 
  that evolved over the past one or two centuries ? 
  i ca n't think of one . 
   sure , smaller languages might die out , but the big ones are n't going anywhere . 
  on this i agree , i do n't think we 'll have a single language anytime soon ( or ever , really ) . 
  i doubt that national languages are going to disappear . 
  if you take france , or romania , for instance , i 'm pretty sure french and romanian will keep existing for a very long time . 
  now , will new distincts dialects appear in france or romania over the course of the next few centuries ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  we rely way more on written language now , and you do n't really have isolated regions in the globe anymore since we have fast transportation and telecommunications ... 
  the reason why languages used to diverge was because they were mostly oral dialects and every town was isolated from other ones , so over centuries , languages tended to evolve separately even in locations that were sort of close . 
  not happening anymore . 
  yes , but these estimates do n't make any sense . 
  according to this , there is almost as many occitan speakers than there are arabic speakers in france . 
  just ask any french person - it 's very common to meet people who can speak arabic in france when you * never * meet someone who can speak occitan ... you 'll notice that the study they used is 15 years old , and ca n't be found anywhere ( `` citation needed '' ) ... 
  it is always the same study that people cite on the internet , recursively quoting each other , without anyone being able to find it , apparently . 
  i tell you that the language is basically dead . 
  yes , maybe you can find a handful of very old people in very remote villages who know some occitan ( although i 'm even doubtful about this ) , but then you can probably find more japanese speakers in france . 
  you never reach a full zero with anything , hell , there are probably even people who learned latin well enough that they can speak it fluently in france . 
  does that mean latin is still alive ? 
  there are n't even any reliable estimates about how many occitan speakers there are , and i believe the ones that exist are gross overestimates . 
  surely having lived in southern france for most of my life and never having met an occitan speaker or talked with people who told me they knew one means something ? 
  where ? 
  never met any . 
   it 's inevitable that we all speak one language someday . 
  i 'm doubtful about that one , 
  yep , from what i understand , the uk is similar to france in this regard . 
  it 's not uncommon to meet italians who can speak a local dialect as well as standard italian though , for instance . 
  does it make sense to you to protect a language that has died and is artificially revived through school , though ? 
  why do n't we do this with latin , then ? 
  it all seems very artificial and pointless to me . 
  the french already have a hard time learning another language than french ( english , for instance ) , let 's not waste our resources on dead languages . 
  what a lot of foreigners do n't seem to realize is that the situation of regional languages in france is very different from what it is in other european countries . 
  i 'm always surprised when i meet people from italy , spain , germany , etc. , and they tell me that they can speak a local dialect ... 
  in france these languages are basically dead , and they have been for a long time . 
  i 've lived in southern france for 22 years , and i 've never met * a single person * in my life who could speak occitan .
