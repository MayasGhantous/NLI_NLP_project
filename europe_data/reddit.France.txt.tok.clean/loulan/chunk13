  huh ? 
  how i met your mother is how i met your mother in france . 
  and pok\u00e9mon names are translated in most ` big ' european languages ( german , etc. 
  ) , so it does n't make a lot of sense . 
  because it 's around christmas ? 
  yes , and it looks stupid . 
  everybody writes ` e-mail ' on a cv . 
  most of my coworkers do n't speak a word of french ... 
  who listens to the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise though ? 
  they keep introducing laughable `` francized '' versions of english words that are so ridiculous that people would make fun of you if you tried to use them ( `` m\u00e9l '' for e-mail , `` partagiciel '' for shareware , etc. ) . 
  even when they try to reform the language , nobody listens to them ( check this for instance : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rectifications_orthographiques_du_fran%c3%a7ais_en_1990 , now read a newspaper like le monde , and you 'll see they do n't follow these `` new '' rules ) . 
  i think foreigners really overestimate the weight of the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise . 
  they 're mostly a few scholars cut off from the world who try to get with the times , but i 'd say most people ignore them . 
  moreover , other languages have this too ( for spanish , see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_academia_espa%c3%b1ola ) and they do n't get all the shit we get about supposedly being anal regarding our language . 
   anyway , i do n't worry because the french language is n't going to disappear . 
  perhaps it will in some ex-colonies , in favor of english , but in france it certainly wo n't in any foreseeable future . 
  however , i do understand the plight of quebecers and cajuns , and i support them in preserving french there . 
  same . 
  i think a lot of americans mix up the french ( i.e. 
  people from france ) with the only french speakers of their continent , i.e. 
  french canadians . 
  which is probably why they think the french are so anal about defending their language , refusing to speak english , etc. 
  this is more of a thing in qu\u00e9bec imo . 
  i do n't really get why people think the french are so adamant about defending their language against some english `` menace '' . 
  i think you guys are mixing us up with quebeckers . 
  hmm ... 
  it could make sense . 
  the uk and france spend much more on their military than other european countries ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) ... and there 's a lot of ufo sightings in both ? 
  that could be related . 
  same . 
  i had no clue we had a lot of ufo sightings ? 
  even for that , people often do n't go to church . 
  especially the first two . 
  i just thought it was because it 's st. no\u00ebl 's day on the calendar on the 25th ? 
  just like we talk about the r\u00e9veillon de la saint-sylvestre for the new year ? 
  i 'd say oysters for christmas are pretty universal in france . 
  i 'm from the alpes-maritimes too ( antibes ) and we always have oysters for christmas . 
  the [ beast of the g\u00e9vaudan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beast_of_g%c3%a9vaudan ) ? 
  the [ tarasque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarasque ) ? 
  unfortunately a lot of people are like dclauzel in france ... 
  oh god . 
  are you for real ? 
  this has nothing to do with pride . 
  you 're just completely delusional . 
  bwahaha with the bullshit you just said , you claim others lack perspective ? 
  you need to go live outside our your country for a while , dude . 
  well , personally on french tv , i love these [ high-budget prime-time history shows ( secrets d'histoire ) ] ( http://www.france2.fr/emissions/secrets-d-histoire ) that are really popular , [ these documentaries about real crimes that are really well done ( faites entrer l'accus\u00e9 ) ] ( http://www.france2.fr/emissions/faites-entrer-l-accuse ) , [ talk shows such as on n'est pas couch\u00e9 ] ( http://www.france2.fr/emissions/on-n-est-pas-couche ) , games like [ la carte aux tr\u00e9sors ( that one does n't exist anymore unfortunately though ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvzpwkw-zes ) , documentary shows like [ des racines et des ailes ] ( http://www.france3.fr/emissions/des-racines-et-des-ailes ) , [ capital ] ( http://www.m6.fr/emission-capital/ ) , [ zone interdite ] ( http://www.6play.fr/m6/zone-interdite#/m6/zone-interdite ) , there are also pretty hilarious comedy shows with stand-up comedians etc. 
  i watch a lot of tv in france , but i 've tried a lot when i was in the us and canada , and really , i could n't find anything like those ... 
  i 'm not a huge fan of fiction/series personally , so those are n't my thing at all . 
  `` everybody watches it '' is a bit of an overstatement , yes some people like american tv series but that 's like what , 10 % of what tv is ? 
  dude , i spent more than a year on your side of the atlantic ( i came back a few months ago ) and one of the things i was missing the most was french tv . 
  it 's really weird that you would think america has good tv , it was terrible . 
  american tv is terrible . 
  it 's sad you only speak english and ca n't see we have much better shows . 
  dude do you realize that english is basically completely useless in our daily lives ? 
  if it were n't for browsing reddit i 'd never even use it . 
  it 's not the `` language of the world '' by far , in many places you never ever need it . 
  come on . 
  nobody gets stuck for life in a country because they ca n't figure out a way to the border . 
  dude you need to use google maps on your phone as a gps if you find it hard to follow a road . 
  what is this , the 80 's ? 
  i 've driven through slovenia a few times to go from southern france to the balkans , it 's never been an issue . 
  yeah it 's not like you have three major european roads going directly from slovenia to austria and italy and people with access to google maps anywhere these days . 
  going from slovenia to the next country is totally harder than taking trains for 3000km !, 
   the road system is a maze and going the wrong way gets you stuck in the mountains . 
  oh come on . 
  these people crossed more than 3000 km to reach slovenia and they wo n't be able to figure out how to cross slovenian mountains ? 
  i mean , it 's no moria . 
  because who does n't like nostalgia ? 
  the graph is n't corrected for inflation ... 
   so most likely in bed . 
  but i am le tired . 
   germany the only country providing eu funding wat almost half of the eu is a net contributor ... 
  socialism only works with competent , productive people . 
  you really overestimate the french if you think socialism can work here :p, 
  socialists in power . 
  the difference is tiny ... and i doubt refugees have university degrees ... 
  i wonder why they do n't want to stay there . 
  maybe austria is less generous to migrants . 
  [ your gdp ppp per capita is higher ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ), 
  is n't austria richer than germany ? 
  it 's frigthening how a single picture can change the policies of whole countries . 
  are we all so irrational ? 
  yeah not really . 
  it 's waaaaaaaay more active in italy than anywhere else . 
  when italy , the one country you think of when you think of organized crime , calls you `` a country of criminals '' , it 's pretty bad . 
  yeah they actually have a life . 
  more like [ africa will rise , demographically speaking ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ozowqng.jpg ) . 
  if we accept hundreds of thousands of immigrants now , how many will we accept when there are more people in africa than in asia ? 
   we have to we really do n't . 
  we 're masochists . 
  it seems so crazy for to do all this for an experiment that will only last a few minutes though ... 
  yeah if there is a country where environmentalists wo n't make it fail it 's definitely france ... 
  i do n't really get why it 's taking so long . 
  i mean , the conception phase started in 1988 , they started building it in 2007 and will finish it in 2027 . 
  are they tackling scientific/engineering problems during these 20 years , with researchers and engineers working on it actively , fixing the design as they 're building it ? 
  or is it just slow because of politics/money ? 
  shut up , you horizontal frenchman . 
  he has a point though , the shitty non-highlighted articles should be removed .
