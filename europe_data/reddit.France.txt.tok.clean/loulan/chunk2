  same when you drive from the french riviera to italy . 
  you go from modern tunnels with led signs and all to holes in the rock ... 
  i think it 's really pretty and cool . 
  tastes ... 
  heh , being from the french riviera , in my case , they always read `` il fumo uccide '' . 
  other than that , to answer op 's question ... hmm ... 
  going to san remo to eat an ice cream on the beach on saturday afternoons is nice i guess ? 
  it seems that you have a flag reading disability . 
  it 's arrogant to not learn flemish ? 
  i bet you 're fluent in flemish then , right ? 
  i 'm sure you also think that english-speaking canadians who are n't fluent in french are arrogant too ? 
  it also depends on what you mean by `` speaking '' a language . 
  it 's so vague that the numbers in this map do n't really make any sense . 
  [ dude , a french nurse was infected alreay . 
  ] ( http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/10/04/french_nurse_infected_with_ebola_has_recovered.html ), 
  okay , say , barcelona then . 
  it was an example . 
  oh i agree it 's probably a great place -- it 's just that you have to fly there , and they are relatively long flights , you have shorter flights within mainland europe that can bring you to very touristy places too . 
  now if the flights to go there are really that cheap that everybody seems to book them , i 'll have to investigate , that sounds interesting :p, 
  it 's strange because it 's not very accessible . 
  more people flew to the canady island than drove to paris ? 
  i think you guys are missing the point here . 
  what poroshenko wants is for the second language to be * not russian * . 
  how exactly do you bill a country and make them pay ? 
  we know about it even though there were zero victims ... 
  which shows the company cares and warned people preventively instead of hiding it and hoping it will be ok ? 
  mistakes happen , there is no evidence the company behaved badly in this case . 
  poorer countries also probably had way more emissions to begin with because they have more manufacturing ... 
  easier to reduce . 
  yeah but to be fair , the reason why the west is targeting the islamic state is n't that they 're afraid they 'll get invaded . 
  well to be fair , what easily recognizable building would you pick in oslo or belgrade ? 
  yeah it sounds more like a way to avoid having to pass through russia than anything else . 
  itt : brits who seem to have never actually used euro plugs . 
  in my opinion they 're pretty good , the american ones are not stable enough , and the uk ones are way too big . 
  also the french version has three prongs ( two coming in , one going out ) . 
  i 'll be another one . 
  in french , `` miam ! '', 
  is n't the sound you make when you eat , it means something like `` yummy ! '' ... 
  and the idea of a girl saying `` ah la vache ! '', 
  when a guy proposes to her is really weird , it 's not the right context at all for this :d ^ also ^ a\u00efe ^ is ^ probably ^ more ^ common ^ than ^ ouille . 
  i would have signed up for it even if i did n't need wifi , the clause is so hilarious . 
  i really think it 's something they fail to take into account in a lot of studies that supposedly show that people are stupid or uneducated . 
  honestly if you poll me and some of the proposed answers to questions are hilariously wrong , i will probably pick those . 
  especially air france pilots ... 
  if i were you , i 'd be ashamed of being so stupid . 
  to be fair , [ catalonia does n't even have the highest gdp per capita in spain . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ranked_lists_of_spanish_autonomous_communities#grp_.28ppp.29_per_capita_per_international_dollars ) it 's not really true that spain feeds off catalonia 's resources , or that a standalone catalonia would be an especially rich country ( its gdp per capita is much lower than france 's for instance ) . 
  the community of madrid is a bit richer and contributes just as much . 
  moreover there 's also the fact that splitting a country in two leads to instability that will probably hurt the economy , regardless of how reach each part is . 
  of these 5 % , how many of them only have notions because they learned it at school ? 
  i do n't even get why according to this map people are supposedly speaking `` italian , sardinian and mon\u00e9gasque '' east and north of monaco . 
  it 's already unlikely that you 'll ever meet a mon\u00e9gasque speaker inside monaco . 
  not to mention people in alsace and lorraine speaking german ... 
  i feel like the people who design these maps just feel like they have to make all languages spill over borders randomly . 
  but at least , for once , they do n't claim that half of france speaks occitan ( which is even more ridiculous ) . 
  it 's higher than britain in non-ppp gdp . 
  i guess the cost of living is higher in france ? 
  and 0 % in my backyard . 
  also from what i understand , since workers benefit from less protection than in some other countries , you have lower employment but that comes at the price of a lot of people working in precarity ? 
  depression . 
  well there 's a bit of it , there 's crimea !, 
  ^ do n't ^ ^ hit ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ please, 
  [ according to this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_french_regions_and_overseas_collectivities_by_gdp ) , the total gdp of french overseas departments is about 30,000 m$ . 
  completely negligible . 
  well the thing is , we already beat england . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal \\ ) ) ( taking the world bank numbers because they 're a bit more recent than the two first ones ) : france 's gdp = 2,611,221 m$ uk 's gdp = 2,471,600 m$ so the gdp of the uk is 5.3 % lower than the gdp of france . 
  now according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_scotland ) , the gdp of scotland is 245,267 m$ . 
  which means that without scotland , the gdp of the uk would be 14.7 % lower than france 's , which is quite a good margin . 
  i 'm satisfied . 
  history is written by the winners , statistics are made by the anglo-saxons . 
  if you look at these education rankings , the tests they give to schoolchildren are very biased towards what they learn at school in the us/uk too . 
  why not ? 
  renault has a history of doing this . 
  exactly . 
  i 'm not really `` against '' anything . 
  just saying that given the situation in spain , more instability could make things even worse . 
  they should wait until the crisis ends or something . 
  the situation in the uk is a bit better so it would n't be as much of an issue . 
  to be fair given the fn results at the last elections , the french do n't even want france in the eu . 
  we just want to save our english bros from it . 
   that 's a non-statement ... 
  uh no it 's not . 
  it 's subjective , but some countries are definitely nicer than others ... 
  there 's a reason why spain is 3rd the third most visited country in the world ...  also , some things are more important than just economics . 
  based on your argument , france should annex belgium . 
  well it seems that you completely misunderstood my argument then . 
  there is no reason why france annexing belgium would make any of the two countries richer , if anything , it would create instability and worsen things ... and it 's completely different to completely remove one country 's sovereignty for no reason at all and to just maintain a status quo that is hundreds of years old in times of crisis ... 
  i 'm really curious as to why you write everything both in french and english . 
  we all understand english since we 're on reddit . 
  it sounds a bit redundant and annoying . 
  i do n't know . 
  spain is such a nice country . 
  i 'm afraid if they split it in two it will become much poorer , it would be such a shame . 
  not only because the rest of spain would lose a rich region like catalunya , but i guess the resulting instability would raise their interest rates and make investments harder . 
  like it 's up to the people from eastern ukraine and crimea to decide if they want to become independent ? 
  sooo to which extent is putin right about this and we are victims of our own propaganda ? 
   i meant to simply imply that statements that can come across as anit-american have a place in normal french public life ( even a minor place ) whereas they do n't have any place in british public life . 
  they really do n't . 
  i had n't even heard that quote from mlp before and i doubt it 's the kind of things that makes people vote for her , it 's a weird quote . 
  pretty sure most people would disagree with her on that , even the people who vote for her .
