  should we tear down the burj dubai because some idiots tried basejumping from the top ? 
  the life of adults who knowingly risk death is always worth less than the buildings or natural wonders they used to kill themselves . 
  society is n't here to babysit people who decide to risk death and prevent them from dying ? 
   if someone would die in there - in full knowledge of the risk - there would be legal action against the owner anyway . 
  i do n't believe for a second they could win such a case , since the person was trespassing . 
  legal action would make no sense . 
  i mean , what next ? 
  we 'll fill the grand canyon with sand because tightrope walkers who attempt to cross it are taking risks or something ? 
  it 's more like 150 . 
  plenty of buildings from that era have heritage status . 
  i 've read what you wrote , and i dont get why all the germans in this thread seem to think it somehow makes sense to destroy a beautiful building ... so that urban explorers who knowingly take risks would n't die ? 
  why should we care if they die ? 
  there must be a cultural gap here because i ca n't understand at all why you think we should destroy a beautiful site just to ensure adults who decided they 'll risk death for fun die . 
  okay so let 's destroy all buildings that are 150 years old , since 150 years old buildings somehow have no value even if they are beautiful . 
  in 150 years , you wo n't be left with any beautiful 300 years old buildings . 
  this kind of silly logic almost got the eiffel tower destroyed . 
  in the 1930 's people thought it had no value , being so modern and new . 
  it 's a historical building now ( and about as old as this ch\u00e2teau ) . 
  i personally think it looks great . 
  many people would call hundertwasser buildings `` kitsch '' too . 
  if they are irresponsible enough to destroy something like this , property should be taken away from them , what they are doing goes against the general interest , it 's criminal . 
  so because of people who make a conscious choice to take risks , we should destroyed a beautiful historical monument for everyone ? 
  let the urban explorers die , they knew the risks and made a choice . 
  are we so desperate for land that we absolutely need this small bit of land to build something on it now instead of waiting for an opportunity someday to maybe save a beautiful historical building ? 
  the atomium is more recent . 
  and a lot uglier . 
  age does n't determine value . 
  it 's a beautiful building . 
  plus if you keep destroying beautiful buildings after 100 years because they are n't old enough , then there wo n't be any buildings older than 100 years . 
  i disagree , it 's a beautiful building . 
  would you also be fine with destroying gaudi or hundertwasser houses because they are n't `` old enough '' ? 
  at least in france , plenty of monuments historiques are from that era . 
  tons of neo-gothic / neo-renaissance ones too . 
  edit : typo, 
  i 've met more belgian ( walloon ) goth girls in my life than french ones . 
  honestly , i 'd take this over the atomium . 
  still beautiful ... removing the stairs surely would n't be hard . 
  i 'm as confused as you are . 
  i 'm kinda hoping we 'll find one on / r/europe :p, 
  it 's actually being demolished at the moment . 
  they started last week . 
  sometimes i feel us europeans do n't realize the beauty of the old buildings we have around us ... 
  too expensive to renovate it apparently . 
  could the various langues d'oc 700 years ago even be considered similar to modern occitan ? 
  plus i mean , you could say that i it 's a shame that 1400 years ago latin was a language of prestige and it 's not anymore id you 're willing to go that far back . 
   it was the language of literature and prestige 700 years ago that 's a bit of an exaggeration . 
  not my point . 
  he wanted to know what living in some cute village feels . 
  there is more than one picture ... 
  good point , [ i wanted to add this image of toulouse ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cityporn/comments/59x44t/toulouse_hautegaronne_france_2362x1572/ ) , but i ca n't add images to the album anymore because it 's published on imgur ... 
  i * think * i 'm supposed to use `` delete post '' but i 'm afraid it will delete the whole album .

  thanks !, 
  have a look at this album and pick : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/50h36l/what_i_like_the_most_in_europe_is_our_old_cities/, 
  i was too lazy to copy all the names . 
  but you 'll find most of them in this album , with names : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/50h36l/what_i_like_the_most_in_europe_is_our_old_cities/ the two last ones are n't in it . 
  they 're collioure and brousse-le-ch\u00e2teau . 
  come live in france for a bit :-), 
  i added pictures of collioure and brousse-le-ch\u00e2teau . 
  better ? 
  which matters quite a lot to be honest :-) each time i 've tried living in the us or canada , i was missing our cute villages and towns . 
  the nature is great over there but it 's less my thing . 
  damn , i used a grep on `` aude '' because it 's one of the d\u00e9partements of occitanie , and it caught `` audemer '' :p edit : [ i wanted to replace it with this image of toulouse ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cityporn/comments/59x44t/toulouse_hautegaronne_france_2362x1572/ ) , but i ca n't add images to the album anymore because it 's published on imgur ...

  in french it would be `` eaux-mortes '' . 
  i do n't really think your average frenchman cares as much about football as you think :-p it 's just a place where they harvest salt . 
  salt . 
  i never felt people were n't nice to me when i was living in paris . 
  i do n't really get this stereotype .

  oh , even more pretty often . 
  4-5 in cheap bars , 5-6 in average bars , 7-8 in expensive places , even 10-12 in some touristy places in paris . 
  that 's my point , you drink less of it . 
  so less calories , even though you have just as much alcohol in the glass . 
  forgive him , he 's probably drunk . 
  man you should try . 
  wine is delicious with meals , and it has way less calories than beer for the same amount of alcohol . 
  in a bar , if you take a glass of wine , it 's less calories and only 2-3 euro instead of 5-6 for a beer . 
  also , wine is great when you cook food with your gf , and if you invite friends over it does n't have to be cold to taste good ( warm beer ... ugh ) . 
  personally , when i was in my early 20 's i drank more beer than wine , but this trend is reversing now that i 'm in my early 30 's . 
  in bars/pubs people definitely drink more beer , but at home , i 'd say wine is very common ( and that 's a good thing , try it people ) . 
  i 'm not sure it really changes anything , economically speaking . 
  we 'll see what happens with the uk . 
  i 'm still not 100 % sure that their economy will be hurt in the long term . 
  honestly , people like to demonize le pen , but if you actually listen to what she says , her policies regarding immigration are n't even tougher than what is already implemented in the us . 
  and regarding the economy , she 's just generally incompetent with no clear plan , chances are she would n't change much . 
   is it true that he turned into a nationalist lately ? 
  sarkozy is always a nationalist just before elections . 
  to be fair , i 'd say all of them are still better than trump . 
  the issue with our leaders is n't that they 're particularly * evil * , like trump the bully or hillary who 's sold to lobbies . 
  it 's more that they are very bland and inefficient . 
  which is n't really their fault , because whenever they try to do something , the whole country goes on strike . 
  it 's just because the country 's economy has been on a downward slope for the past 30 years . 
  so each leader is hated more than the previous one . 
  whether they have any control on this is n't clear though . 
  other than that , hollande is n't doing more mistakes than sarkozy or chirac .
