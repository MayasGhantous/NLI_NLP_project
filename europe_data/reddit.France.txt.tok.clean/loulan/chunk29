  i 'm confused . 
  i wonder if they restored it at all . 
  it 's in such perfect condition . 
  cars driving right by a roman aqueduct . 
  spain y u so weird . 
  in all seriousness though , what if a truck ran into one of the pillars ? 
  there would probably be some damage , which would be a shame . 
  first the helicopters , and now this . 
  over here it was very hot until last week , it 's like summer lasted all of september . 
  then all of a sudden , crazy wind , rain , and a lot of snow on the mountains nearby . 
  i hope the ski season will be better than last year ( it was awful ) . 
  nope !, 
   and there 's a famous video demonstrating old english ; it might as well be a different language . 
  the words are similar ; like how norman might be similar to french but the pronunciation is completely different which is key ; just because i can read it in modern english does n't mean it 's right i think you really underestimate how far you can go before a language becomes impossible to understand . 
  they made us read the original version of [ le roman de renart ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_de_renart ) back in school . 
  it dates back from the 12th century . 
  sure you have some footnotes etc. , but it 's still french and you can still understand most of it . 
   given that english written 500 years ago is very difficult for your average native english speaker to understand , i very much doubt that a native french speaker could understand a language spoken 950 years ago . 
  uuuh ... reading shakespeare is n't that hard at all . 
  these sentences are so close to modern french that basically , only spellings are different . 
  the only words that are different are `` honir '' which is n't commonly used anymore but perfectly understandable , and `` bille '' which is like `` bill '' in english . 
  well i mean . 
  okay , some ancestors of william himself ( 3-4 generations before ) were vikings . 
  but the normans by then had assimilated with the local population , and were pretty much indifferentiable at that point . 
  old norman was a langue d'o\u00efl just like modern french , and it 's very much understandable by a modern french speaker ( at least when it 's written ) . 
  the army that fought in the battle of hastings was a mix of descendants from the local population , with some people who had some of their grandparents who were vikings , but everybody was speaking a language similar to french . 
  the fact that everybody was speaking a langue d'o\u00efl shows that the vikings was a minority that assimilated with the rest of the population . 
  the descendants of normans are mostly part of modern france too . 
  so i do n't really see how you can consider them to not be french . 
  i guess if they came from any other part of france you could argue that they were not * actually * french because going back a few generations you could find some visigoth blood or whatever among a few of them . 
  i feel like this `` norman not french '' distinction is something brits made up because they would n't tolerate having lost to the french . 
  which is kinda silly . 
  is your graph really supposed to convince us it goes both ways ? 
  because your tiny bump recovered quickly and it 's smaller than most of the noise . 
  while the gbp is plummeting ... 
  gotcha , there is no correlation . 
  well i 'm from alpes-maritimes , so i 'm a bit biased :p from antibes too actually , so hi neighbor :p, 
  well i mean , disneyland tries to reproduce a medieval european town with its castle and houses ;-) so yeah , 100 % real . 
  really strange since iirc ille and villaine are two rivers ? 
  we 're actually nice :|, 
  come , we 'll grab a beer somewhere ;-), 
  nope !, 
  i found them online . 
  except for the 3-4 ones that are marked oc . 
  same here but we live in a beautiful place . 
  hard to notice until we move somewhere else ;-), 
  what ? 
  [ but you guys have the longest cycle path in europe !,

  yes !, 
  i often drive to san remo . 
  it 's a very nice place to bike on weekends :-) and only 30 minutes away from nice . 
  menton and ventimiglia are right next to each other !, 
  i extracted these pics from a gallery of french villages i posted some weeks ago on / r/europe , but apparently the images were downscaled in the process . 
  [ for full-resolution images , please check the original gallery . 
  so ... is this a thing ? 
  do we do regions of each country now ? 
  [ here we go with france !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56sgq2/regions_of_france_provencealpesc%c3%b4te_dazur/ ) btw , valle d'aosta is beautiful . 
  italy is my favorite european country . 
  same with the volkswagen scandal . 
  but people always twist what they learn to make it fit in their stereotyped vision of the world . 
  if the volkswagen or deutsche bank scandals had happened , in greece , portugal , italy , spain , or france , it would be `` oh these lazy corrupt < nationality  '' . 
  it happens in germany ? 
  `` oh well it 's an isolated case , they still are the best engineers and honest bankers . '', 
  it 's actually pretty surprising you 'd go all the way from mexico to belarus for tourism , as it 's not a very touristy country by any standard ? 
  go eat a kouign amann . 
   i think it 's obvious you should know your allies and partners better than others . 
  i completely disagree . 
  i think it 's much better to know the flags of the biggest countries all around the world , than to know all the flags of even the smallest countries around you . 
  it 's better to have a general worldwide view than a close-minded view of only the eu . 
  and in any case we 're talking about flags here . 
  arbitrary colors and patterns picked by countries . 
  it 's as irrelevant as national anthems . 
  learning capitals is more important , they 're actual places at least . 
  edit : and btw , according to google maps , driving from my hometown to talinn is 2815km . 
  this is kind of stupid . 
  both countries are thousands of kilometers away . 
  why would it be more useful to your life to know the * flags * of countries that are in the eu and nato ? 
  i do n't really see how knowing the flag of estonia is more important than knowing the flag of belize . 
  honestly i do n't think i 've ever hard to learn a list of flags at school . 
  it seems kinda pointless , i 'd rather spend more time understanding the geopolitics and history of european countries than learning which pattern and colors a tiny country decided to pick as its flag . 
  what next , should we learn national anthems too ? 
  i mean , knowing countries and capitals i can understand . 
  but flags ? 
  i 'd rather spend more time understanding geopolitics and history of european countries than mindlessly learning a list of colors and patterns . 
  i do n't think they ever made us learn that at school . 
  well ukraine is pretty close to estonia . 
  do you know the flag of , say , belize ? 
  wait ... you learned flags at school ? 
  heh i know all capitals in the world by heart . 
  flags are n't as useful or well-known though . 
  if you consider people who do n't know the flag of every small country on the planet by heart to be dumb , you probably do n't know a lot of `` smart '' people . 
  heh , you 're from my region !, 
  i had no clue we could use the flag here . 
  oh , i do . 
  i can even guess pretty accurately which sides a commenter will take on an issue like kosovo just by looking at the flag . 
  heh , time to leave . 
  pretty sure we started using the guillotine like crazy * just after * [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_the_rights_of_man_and_of_the_citizen ) . 
  [ here are a few more in france .
