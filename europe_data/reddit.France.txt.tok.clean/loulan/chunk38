  continuing the slow descent into the abyss ? 
  i think you may not be fully aware of marine le pen 's program . 
  disregarding her stance on immigration , she wants to exit the eu , go back to the franc , and implement an extremely left-wing welfare system . 
  even if she could somehow save us from terrorism , she 'd ruin the economy ... 
  you 're being downvoted but i 'm surprised too . 
  not even * once * in 14 years ? 
  til ireland is * way * colder than france . 
  dude , it 's above 30 \u00b0 c all summer here in the french riviera and most people do n't have ac at home . 
  i think it 's similar in most of europe . 
  what is n't ? 
  [ this article from a few months ago is about the president of the french football federation ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/sports/2016/06/22/euro-2016-pour-le-graet-l-objectif-des-demi-finales-reste-le-meme_1461232 ) stating that our objective was to reach the semi-finals , for instance . 
  bah , being an adult is about being objective about your strengths and your weaknesses . 
  you can call that `` surrendering '' , i call that `` not being an idiot '' . 
  the objective was to reach the semi-finals , from the beginning , and it was an optimistic objective . 
  we ended up in the final . 
  i would n't really say we 're down on the ground , a few months ago nobody would have believed we had a chance to reach the final . 
  there was no such ad campaign . 
  '' i.e. 
  :  this issue is concerning , because the bolkenstein law makes it possible for a polish plumber or an architect from estonia to work in france with the same salary and welfare they would have in their home country . 
  which is hardly hatred towards poles ... not to mention he was talking about a hypothetical scenario in the future . 
  i do n't think anyone thinks france is overwhelmed by poles , you never meet any here . 
  no but it 's just ... 
  different . 
  i 've never heard people bashing poles in france for instance . 
  the only eastern european hate i see is about gypsies , but they are n't really white . 
  heh , if they can hate us less for a few days , that 's a good thing . 
  i 'm kinda surprised they hate poles in the uk . 
  i mean , they are n't even brown . 
  / r/soccer is so incredibly butthurt . 
  i do n't even care about football but it 's funny . 
  the thing is , france is full of sparsely populated countryside , which is what you see on most of this map . 
  immigrants do n't really live there . 
  they live in cities , but given the size of our d\u00e9partements , this is n't really visible on the map . 
  these people suck at writing urls . 
  yeah it would be pretty stupid to not at least try to attract finance jobs just because `` finance '' is `` your enemy '' . 
  this is empty rhetoric hollande used to attract uneducated voters , but he is ( fortunately ! ), 
  being pragmatic now . 
  although i 'm not really convinced these incentives will be efficient at all . 
  polls showed uk voters backed remain during the run up to the referendum ... 
   poor guy !, 
  i think he 's doing an okay job , and i voted for the other guy !, 
  are you me ? 
  he 's reforming the country more than sarkozy did , because people protest less against you if you 're ps . 
  so i think he 's doing pretty well !, 
  benelux, 
  i ca n't believe the eu is ruled by this guy and nobody 's in the streets protesting . 
  it is . 
  the only sane comment on this page , downvoted . 
  [ look at 2000 . 
  ] ( https://www.google.fr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:deu:fra&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr&amp;ind=false ) i would n't exactly that `` down the shitter '' . 
  yeah i do n't get it . 
  canada or australia are n't in the eu and they 're doing pretty well . 
  everybody on this sub is acting like this is the end of the uk , when there is no reason to believe so really . 
  in the winter , pure cold water can be freezing cold . 
  they were tourists who vacation with bombs in their backpacks . 
  still better than nothing ? 
  is n't the issue that she ca n't really rinse the dishes because they have separate taps over there for hot and cold water , so you ca n't get any water to flow at a decent temperature , and you 're forced to mix hot and cold water in the bowl , which makes rinsing things impossible ? 
  honestly , i 'm more offended by the fact that they have two separate taps for hot and cold water . 
  apparently , since you 're not able to get any water flowing at a decent temperature , you 're supposed to mix it in the bowl and wash you hands in that ... kinda disgusting . 
  it probably also explains why they do n't really rinse dishes though . 
  they have to use water in the bowl , if they do n't want to freeze or burn their hands . 
  crazy people . 
  pretty sure junker is one of us in / r/europe , trolling like crazy . 
  i do n't think it 's linked to that . 
  i 've never heard of people hating on poles in france . 
  it really is a uk-only thing in my experience . 
  my girlfriend is polish ( she lives in france ) and part of her family lives in the uk , apparently it 's a completely different experience for them compared to her . 
  this is probably because there are so many more poles in the uk than in other european countries ( they 're extremely rare here , other than my girlfriend i 've met maybe one in my life ) . 
  the commission president probably should n't have been managing a tax haven for years either . 
  and yet here we are . 
  honestly , i never get these complaints . 
  if these people do n't believe strongly enough in their opinion to go vote , maybe they are n't lazy . 
  maybe it just means that they are not sure enough of themselves , or do n't care enough about the subject , to decide voting is important . 
  so maybe it 's perfectly fair that they do n't go . 
  i 'm not sure forcing everybody to vote would lead to results that are more relevant . 
  it would probably push more people who lean slightly more to the left without having paid too much attention about politics or caring to vote , yes . 
  are those relevant votes , if they 're been obtained by forcing those people to make a choice ? 
  a few times in my life , i did n't vote , when i was younger . 
  not because i was a lazy asshole ( it 's not like i 'm less lazy now ) , simply because i did n't really care either way , and did n't feel like i had a strong enough opinion to vote . 
  i feel like the way i vote nowadays is a lot more relevant because i 've learned a lot more and i have much stronger convictions . 
  i 'm glad i was n't forced to vote back then because i would probably have picked the left-wing ballot just because that 's what other young people do , not because i really had an opinion . 
  i mean , i would also prefer it if there was no brexit . 
  but i feel like people who want to force young people to vote only want to do that because it serves their interests . 
  i 'm no pro-brexiter , but come on people . 
  of course after huge news like this , there is so much uncertainty that the markets will drop . 
  the initial drop does n't mean much though , it 's in the medium/long term that we 'll see how the markets behave . 
  you ca n't read too much in this drop . 
  nah , google-translating english to french does n't work well at all . 
  to be fair , unless your native language is a slavic language , you have to be a goddamn genius to write correct polish . 
  this is how i feel when i read news about france on reddit . 
  you can post anything on reddit someone nobody knows from country x said , and people will assume they 're famous is that country . 
  [ this is an example of a post talking about a `` french mep '' who 's virtually unknown in france , for instance . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pjym6/french_mep_jeanluc_schaffhauser_has_blamed/ ) it really makes me wonder how relevant what i read on / r/europe is on a daily basis . 
  efta works for norway , no quotas on their fisheries , no voting rights but in any case they are a small country so it dose n't change much , they pay a bit much for what they get but they 're rich as fuck anyway ... 
  they do n't get things like eu research grant but again , they do n't need eu money . 
  and they get access to the single market . 
  for the uk , it would be a different story . 
  what you 're saying makes no sense . 
  if the uk was in the eea it would pay much less per capita than norway ... 
  ... which is exactly my point ?
