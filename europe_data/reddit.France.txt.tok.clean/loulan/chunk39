  it is , of course . 
  why do you think richer countries pay much more per capita and poorer countries get more money ? 
  norway would pay much more if it were a full member . 
  they 're getting a huge discount . 
  but its gdp per capita is much higher . 
   i mean , particularly for the uk it 's basically being an eu member but not getting to vote and likely not getting to have their previous opt-outs . 
  ... and not paying billions each year ... 
  they happened to have more growth in the past few months , which is why this referendum was successful , probably . 
  which does n't mean it 's related to them having joined the eu , especially since if you look at historical gdp graphs , there seems to be no correlation between their growth and them having joined the eu ... 
  the uk has been in the eu for 23 years , why would you attribute their growth in the past few months to the eu , when they were not doing particularly well on average for the past 23 years ?

  how is it better than before ? 
  if anything , it 's the countries that stayed out that had staggering economic growth . 
  sounds unlikely . 
  but that does n't mean the eu wo n't fall apart . 
  there is a difference between watching the trainwreck that erdogan has become with morbid curiosity , and people caring about turkey wanting to join the eu or not when they never wanted them in the first place . 
  i have never even heard of this guy . 
  the whole thing sounds like james bond though . 
  billionaires indirectly destabilizing countries for speculation . 
  no idea if there is any truth to this but it sounds pretty awesome . 
   more than you think . 
  nah , nobody cares about turkey outside turkey . 
  this is insane . 
  it does n't even look like real covers . 
  a completely different world . 
  i do n't know . 
  this style is fairly uncommon in france , while i saw it everywhere in us newspapers . 
  maybe they do it in the uk , and it 's more of an anglo-saxon thing ? 
  what i hate about their political satire comics is that they always explain every metaphor by explaining in plain letters what everything is supposed to mean . 
  [ like in this comic for instance . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jleodtj.jpg ) why write `` china '' on the girl with slanted eyes and chopsticks ? 
  it ruins everything . 
  this style of comics is very american . 
  edit : grammar, 
  [ typical case of disaster voyeurism . 
  i personally find it hilarious . 
  independence day . 
  i 'm not pro-brexit but you got ta admit , this is genius . 
  heh , i think in most european capitals you can have both . 
  i personally enjoy sightseeing . 
  i highly doubt many tourists go in a caf\u00e9 during daytime and start talking to random strangers . 
  only the most extroverted ones , probably . 
   frankly , i think decisions like this should not be decided by people who have no degree in economics . 
  these kinds of argument from authority are a bit weak . 
  if you take nobel-prize winning economists , they do n't agree at all on what is the best course of action for most things . 
  a lot of them are very liberal , and then you have people like paul krugman and thomas piketty who are the opposite . 
  you have economists who think the brexit is a good thing . 
  truth is , nobody really know what would happen . 
  lots of economists thought the euro would be a good thing , but in the end , countries not being able to control inflation turned out to be a pretty big issue . 
  economy is n't a hard science , economists have enlightened opinions , but they are by no means 100 % reliable . 
  not to mention that the brexit is n't only about the economy . 
  god . 
  when i went to brussels , the main highlights were the manneken pis -- which is the tiniest / most boring fountain ever ; the atomium -- which is alright but located in a fucking * roundabout * and it feels like they did n't know what to put inside of it ; and this mini-europe park which was almost cringeworthy . 
  the grand-place was nice though . 
  so i spent the rest of the trip drinking beer and eating waterzooie there . 
  cute city , but not the best landmarks . 
  then it would be glorious . 
  no , your country has shady tax practices that fuck over all other eu countries , i never even mentioned france here . 
  you 're just randomly attacking my nationality even though it 's completely unrelated to the subject , because you have zero arguments . 
  oh god , we 're going in circles . 
  i feel like i 'm arguing with a teenager . 
  which is probably the case . 
  and now strikes . 
  are you really so unable to find arguments to defend your country 's behavior that you have to pick any random negative thing you can find about other countries even though it 's completely unrelated ? 
  this is about as stupid as if i started bashing the taste of kilkenny . 
   lol and you do n't think france benefits from eu funding ? 
  nope , france spends way more than it receives . 
  oh yes , poor ireland , so vulnerable because it 's a `` small '' economy . 
  getting billions in eu funds each year and screwing every other eu country . 
  and their defense ? 
  `` oh but country x sold weapons to a country i dislike ! '', 
  why does it even matter ? 
  do you really think saudi arabia would n't find weapons if country x stopped selling them some ? 
  as for libya , france got nothing out of this war . 
  i mean , open your eyes instead of using scapegoats that sound more like conspiracy theories than anything . 
  this is completely unrelated . 
  which really shows how desperate you are in your justifications . 
  i never said france was perfect . 
  this does n't mean ireland is n't fucking over the rest of the eu when it comes to multinationals . 
  when you resort to justifying your actions using an argument like `` ha but at least we do n't kill people '' , you know you 're doing something pretty bad . 
  with these kinds of arguments , you can basically do anything , because the us waged an unfair war in iraq , so you 're not as bad as them anyway !, 
  actually there is n't even a 4 % drop . 
  so maybe there was n't a 4 % collapse at all , since it seems that most of nokia actually survived . 
  in the end , the company pays * all * taxes , not just the corporate tax . 
  i do n't see why only the corporate tax would matter . 
  you have to pay your engineers more if their salaries are taxed more . 
  it really sounds like the irish press cherry-picks the numbers they like to feed you with the narrative irish people want . 
  there is a reason why multinationals all go to ireland and not other eu countries . 
  so is this article about `` the fall of nokia '' wrong ? 
  is nokia just as successful as it used to be ? 
  [ their gdp is still lower than in 2008 though . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:fin&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false ), 
  the overall tax bill is way more relevant than just the corporate tax . 
   -- although they were slugged with an overall tax bill of 66.6 % thanks to massive labour and other taxes . 
  what about you quote the whole sentence instead of just the part that suits your narrative ? 
  most european countries have < 2 % growth a year nowadays , and often < 1 % . 
  taking -4 % all of a sudden is huge . 
  what would you say if a country had a four-year -1 % growth ( more or less ) ? 
  pretty sure nokia got screwed the day they switched to windows mobile . 
  i never understood why they did n't just go with android .
