  i 'm not quite sure what the difference between `` fry '' and `` grill '' is here . 
  just the shape of the pan ? 
  unless you 're a fancy man who eats barbecue every other day . 
  do you really cook steaks with olive oil ? 
  i do when i have no more butter , it tastes awful . 
  let 's invade and make them say , `` pain au xocolat '' . 
   what kind of black magic do you guys use to turn p\u00e2te feuillet\u00e9e into bread ( pain ) anyway ? 
  i mean , what do you call a pain aux raisins ? 
  to be fair , most people use both . 
  i 'm from the south , and in my family , we tend to use olive oil for raw stuff ( salads , pan bagnats , etc. 
  ) , but butter we fry something in a pan ( meat , eggs , etc. 
  / r/villageporn and / r/castles are basically `` pics of europe '' :-) / r/europics exists but it 's a small subreddit . 
  heh , alsace , the alps , and provence are really nice too . 
  yes . 
  look at the color of the roofs . 
  victim blaming much ? 
  vladivostok is too . 
  latitudes do n't mean much . 
  i thought it was a valid question , actually . 
  nah , buses are kinda slow . 
   i have no problem cutting the carcass , it 's very common even for a loner nerdy guy ? 
  damn , nerds in italy are different . 
  google maps says 28-40 minutes on a monday at 17:30 pm , which is basically the worst hour when it comes to traffic . 
   but just a one hour drive from nice so that 's pretty cool . 
  it 's actually less than 30 minutes away from nice ( ~ 20km ) . 
  no need to go far north . 
  pretty sure i could take a similar picture less than one hour away from where i live , and i 'm from the french riviera . 
  all you need is pine trees and a bit of snow . 
  we have plenty of those in the southern alps . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  what can the us do if they use it anyway ? 
  threaten of nuclear war ? 
  as long as most workplaces are 9-5 and that the convention is to eat lunch at 12 and dinner at 19-20 , hours matter , sorry . 
  come on , winter time is fucking depressing . 
  it gets dark way too early . 
  if you want to stop dst , then let 's be in dst * all the time * . 
  homosexuality was banned in ireland in the 80 's ?!, 
  was it enforced ? 
  why the wrong generation ? 
  these are just villages in the mountains . 
  you can find them now too ? 
  it 's even more misleading to claim the difference between polls and vote results are necessarily only caused by abstention . 
  you also have a lot of people who will reply something different when they 're polled and it does n't matter , compared to what they actually do when they vote and feel like their choice is important / could have consequences . 
  then again , do n't you eat cod fish all the time in portugal ? 
  what is it with christmas and seafood ? 
  we eat oysters and salmon here . 
  i suspect it might be a religious thing but we * also * eat meat ( foie gras , turkey etc. ), 
  so maybe not . 
  so wait , you actually did this , kept a fish in your bathtub for days ? 
  so we 're back to the question : did n't you shower ? 
  never heard of it . 
  there even is superdry . 
  while i kinda agree , the president of the eu commission saying the institution he 's presiding is essential is a non-info . 
  you could n't find anyone who 's more biased ... 
  why strange ? 
  it seems perfectly logical . 
   and nizza was the birthplace of garibaldi , it 's hard to argue for its pure frenchness . 
  so dumb . 
  i was born in nice . 
  nobody here thinks they 're italian in any way . 
  it 's pretty popular yes . 
  but since you have * a lot * of beaches all around the island , you can find some that are pretty much empty . 
  that 's kind of an exageration . 
  everybody speaks french fluently in corsica and while many people learn corsican as a second language , french is the native language of most corsicans . 
  there has n't really been any terrorism in at least a decade . 
  and trying to depict corsicans as italians is something italians have been doing since the island has become french , more than 200 years ago . 
  source : most of my family is corsican . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ got ta ^ ^ ^ admit ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ short ^ ^ ^ tempered , ^ ^ ^ though . 
  there are even ski resorts in corsica :-), 
  so ... did you configure your computer/phone to turn `` turkey '' into an emoji of the animal , or were you too lazy to type it out ?

  do birds even eat olives ? 
  raw olives are n't really edible , you have to soften/salt them etc. 
  are hungarians in romania as wealthy as romanians in general ? 
  sometimes minorities are n't . 
  triggered ? 
  whoo !, 
  red !, 
  my house is surrounded with olive trees . 
  i 've never seen anyone harvest any olives because we are n't poor enough to bother . 
  am i in ? 
  one of our politicians is * actually * going to jail ? 
  i ca n't believe it . 
  actually i do . 
  what 's the source for your survey ? 
  are redditors supposed to be 16-26yo ? 
  til i 'm old as fuck for reddit . 
  yeah , i know . 
  the thing is , france and the uk have a very similar gdp . 
  the uk has much lower unemployment , but it just means the gdp is spread among more working people . 
  so basically , in the uk , you have more people working part time for a very low wage , while this is more rare in france . 
  instead we have plenty of people unemployed and living on welfare , who are probably depressed as fuck . 
  not sure which is better . 
  does n't seem so . 
  lots of british people in this thread keep saying that their economy is doing great but i doubt they 're considering whether their situation got better too . 
  the question is , does having growth matter if only the top 10 % see benefits from it ? 
  i guess even if your average poor person is n't doing better than before , if they see on tv that there is gdp growth , it makes them prideful and happy or something . 
  it reminds me of when people post `` ratatouilles '' on reddit . 
  to be fair , immigrants probably pick their # 1 destination more based on the language than intolerance .
