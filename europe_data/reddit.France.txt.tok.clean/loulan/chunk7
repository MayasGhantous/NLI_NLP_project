  not really . 
  if you take black stereotypes for instance , people believe them but they do n't say it in public . 
  but somehow bashing people who were born black is frowned upon and seen as xenophobic , while you can have whole circlejerks of people bashing people who were born in france and then it 's not xenophobic , it 's perfectly okay , apparently . 
  what is so sad about this is that it 's pretty obvious that a lot of people repeating these things have never really been in contact with french people and just repeat what they 've been told ... or they went to paris for a few days and were so lost in their confirmation bias that all they did was looking for excuses to confirm their preconceived ideas . 
  the issue with french stereotypes is that a lot of people actually believe them . 
   an example i 've heard of is a governmental committee that 's responsible for keeping anglicisms out of popular use . 
  oh please ... 
  there are a lot of myths about france that foreigners like throwing around . 
  the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise often suggests `` frenchified '' version of english words , but nobody uses them , we usually make fun of them because they are ridiculous ( m\u00e9l , mot-di\u00e8se , etc. ) ... 
  and it 's just random words they add to their dictionary , it 's not like anyone is trying to keep people from using anglicisms . 
  we do n't like anglicisms ? 
  since when ? 
  we are not qu\u00e9bec ... and american tv series are very popular here so i do n't get where you got that idea from that we do n't want american tv . 
  oh come on , this is ridiculous . 
  i 've never understood this stereotype that the french think their culture is superior , the french are the champions of self-loathing ... 
  as someone who grew up in nice and moved to paris afterwards ( when i was 21 ) , paris is an awesome city but damn the weather is utter shit compared to nice . 
  i miss nice a lot . 
  the southeast has much better weather ( see [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pkhwagr.png ) for instance ) . 
  erm i do n't mention it usually , but you have to admit it was relevant in this case . 
  as a frenchman who 's pretty high right now , i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i 'm pretty proud of my country for once . 
  it 's only 0.5 % growth . 
  for one quarter . 
  not really something that you can directly notice in daily life . 
  well , this morning , [ it was announced that france 's growth in the second quarter was 0.5 % instead of the expected 0.2 % ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2013/08/14/la-croissance-rebondit-de-0-5-au-deuxieme-trimestre_3461166_3234.html ) . 
  it 's nothing crazy , but it 's not like the economy is going down the shitter . 
  take the things you see on reddit with a grain of salt , confirmation bias is a strong thing here . 
  anything positive about sweden will be upvoted here , and anything positive about france will be downvoted . 
  redditors are in love with northern europeans and have a strong dislike for the french based on ( ridiculous ) stereotypes . 
  it 's the same with all countries , only the articles that tend to corroborate what the hivemind already thinks get upvoted . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://www.eturbonews.com/36518/foreign-tourists-spain-spent-66-percent-more-h1 ) , 19.4 % of the tourism revenue in spain comes from the uk , so it would be 5 % of 19.4 % , i.e. 
  less than 1 % ... 
  1 ) most tourists in spain are n't from the uk , it 's only part of the tourists , so it 's 5 % of some % . 
  2 ) i do n't even see why 5 % of british tourists would n't come to spain over this . 
  because british tourists would n't come if gibraltar did n't belong to the uk ? 
  no dude , 20 % of the president 's salary is more than the country 's debt . 
  problem solved now . 
  we call a thong `` un string '' though . 
  that one is weird . 
   hippies use `` man '' like you 'd call someone `` dude '' . 
  hmm ... so ? 
  also we say `` baskets '' for sneakers . 
  yeah we can also pick another language later of course . 
  the two first ones are mandatory though . 
  i also took latin and ancient greek but both were optional ( and it was in addition to your second and third language ) . 
  i 'm surprised you do n't have the option to pick italian , then again i grew up in the french riviera which is pretty close to italy , so maybe that 's why i could . 
  pretty common i 'd say , actually german is the only language that you can start before english at school ( for your second language you can usually pick either german or english , for your third , you can usually pick german , english , spanish or italian ) . 
  i 'd say that most people start with english for their second language , and then for their third language , the majority of people pick spanish , some pick german , and a few ones pick italian . 
  english is enough for work , but for a decent social life , knowing the language of the country you live in is definitely a good thing . 
  i need to learn german . 
  that 's a very strange idea :-), 
  fwiw , i 've always found the irish coins very pretty . 
  from paris , france : * france 5 * belgium 2 * eire 1 * spain 1 * portugal 1, 
  and his little brother sarkozy !, 
  okay i 'll show myself out . 
  also \\* we do n't know how to format \\* redditcomments . 
  i 'm \\*\\* so ashamed . 
  yeah , all that era with the enlightenment philosophers was pretty cool . 
  and i like how during the french revolution , foreign countries tried to take advantage of it and started wars against france , and we still kicked their asses while having completely unstable governments that changed all the time . 
  that was pretty cool !, 
  dude you make us look bad . 
  i thought the ops were jews and it was a conspiracy to dominate europe . 
   i find it more unbelievable that in the country of moulin rouge and folies berg\u00e8re that only 6 % has been to a strip club !, 
  to be fair , moulin rouge and folies berg\u00e8res are for tourists . 
  it 's always only foreigners who talk about this . 
  i live in paris and i 've never been there and i doubt a lot of french people did . 
   i want to go to thailand . 
  let them eat cake ... 
  well being french , i 've rarely ever met religious people in my life . 
  there was this one guy in my university who went to church but everybody thought he was crazy . 
  and france is always # 1 in europe in these polls ... [ in this one , for instance , france is # 1 for `` belief in neither a spirit , god , or life force '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_atheism#europe_and_russia ) . 
  i still do n't get where the people from these protests came from ... 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's more conservative people who do n't want the society to change than actual religious people . 
  or if it 's actual religious people , they seem to somehow have managed to find all the few remaining ones and to get them to come to paris together , it 's pretty impressive . 
  it could also be conservative people who followed the religious movement because it suited them . 
  ah , right . 
  well i would say that the crous has nothing to do with the government , and yes , i doubt they would reply to e-mails , that 's the kind of organization you need to call :p, 
  why do you send e-mails to the french government ? 
  honestly , i do n't get what we did to the world . 
  not to mention the motto of the [ english chivalric order of the garter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honi_soit_qui_mal_y_pense ) !, 
  ^ ( on my side of course , come live here in the french riviera like every other brit ), 
  you guys are on a friggin ' island . 
  that was easy . 
  ^ ( even the motto of your royal family is in french bwahaha ), 
  who won what ? 
  the battle of hastings ? 
  we did it * while * striking , you dirty brit !, 
  take that !, 
  ^ ( i fart in your general direction ), 
  we did it first !, 
  what a bunch of retards . 
  he promised to give interviews once in a while before he was elected . 
  that 's the only promise he is able to keep . 
  leave him that :p, 
  he does n't believe it , nobody believes him , he knows nobody believes him . 
  but what else is he supposed to say ? 
  the guy has to talk to the country once in a while . 
  now i want to play dark ages of camelot again . 
  yes , i 've travelled a lot and never had any problem with just gestures and english , it 's more than enough for everything you need . 
  and if you want to hold a more meaningful conversation you can * always * find someone who speaks decent english , especially in europe ... not sure what op is worried about .
