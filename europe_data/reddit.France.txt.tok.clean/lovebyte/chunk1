grand , not grande , you peasant !, 
  sure , you go first . 
   he may not be the best man out there understatement of the year !, 
  so do we in france . 
  that 's the only way he ( she ? ), 
  could go up in opinion polls . 
  in the last 25 years , i have been forced to use windows for 18 months only . 
  everyone is complaining about micro-states and forgetting the irish-dutch sandwich , switzerland , austria , ... 
  typical german . 
  thinking their banks have a monopoly on evil !, 
  20 or 30 % fn voters are extremely different to the ukip ones . 
  maybe most fn voters dislike the euro , but anti europe , certainly not . 
  the fn voters are anti current and past french governments , politicians , ... ; similarly to the uk . 
  the euroskeptics component of the fn and ukip are radically different . 
   they 've got almost as many euroskeptics as the british no . 
   i never heard about bio-ethics committees until now and i doubt my country has one you should really think and get informed before writing down idiocies like this . 
  you should read the pdf report those statistics come from . 
  it clearly shows that religious belief is one of ( if not ) the most relevant differentiator when it comes to your attitude/opinions towards biotechnology . 
  every country has a bio-ethics committees which are full of unelected so-called religious leaders who , most of the time , are a lot more conservative than the people they are supposed to represent . 
  they decide what can and can not happen . 
  their beliefs has a direct impact on you , even for the most atheistic countries in europe like france and the czech republic . 
  so much brutality ; so much poetry . 
  we recently killed a princess of yours , would you like us to kill your queen too ? 
  / / / too soon ? 
  croissance ( growth ) in fact !, 
  his french is excellent and very impressive . 
   now that the senate agreed to 15 regions the french senate is a useless piece of shite and will be ignored . 
  in all likelihood , there will be 13 regions . 
   there are basically three main levels of high-school education in the netherlands . 
  the lowest of which , vmbo , appearantly gets closed on some schools to keep the school `` white '' . 
  this reminds me of my dutch in-laws asking if my son was in a white school , in france . 
  i was speechless . 
  i think it was air traffic control , not pilots . 
  you can not replace pilots with military ones since it 's not the same planes thy are flying . 
  that means nothing . 
  in germany like in france a small minority of workers can strike and paralyse a country . 
   their members have a lot of power , for example the engine drivers of deutsche bahn or pilots welcome to france where a very small minority of workers are unionised , but they have lots of power to be a real pain in the arse . 
  same for an important member of the french green party , http://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-vincent_plac\u00e9 sorry on mobile ... 
  every french couple i know has kids . 
  the immigrants are not the main reason . 
  and his assistant , joost de teep . 
  is ray charles a local hero ? 
  oh i see , indeed it was first as in largest . 
  however the latest news shows that france is the [ largest producer ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/wirestory/france-reclaims-title-worlds-largest-wine-maker-26399798 ) world wide . 
  it changes most years anyway , since wine production is highly dependent on weather conditions . 
  maybe on another planet , but on this one france , italy and spain are the top 3 producers . 
  and according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wine-producing_countries ) , georgia is 24th . 
  latest producing values ( not the 2011 ones shown in wikipedia ) showed that france overtook italy for the number one spot . 
   the reason reddit is blocked is because ttip is being negotiated in the european parliament and reddit is known to be somewhat critical of the treaty . 
  / r/tinfoil _ hats at the very least . 
   why are there so many africans on the coast of france trying to get into britain british ex-colonies . 
  the people that are desperately trying to get to england are from afghanistan , syria , ... not people from french ex-colonies like cameroon , senegal , algeria , ... 
  ok , thanks . 
  wrong . 
  you can certainly travel to the french ones ( with a blue star on the map ) . 
  martinique , guadeloupe , r\u00e9union island in the indian ocean , french guyana , ... 
  they are part of the eu . 
  what about the [ kerguelen islands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kerguelen_islands ) ? 
  que ? 
   our public sectors should actively benchmark each others to find things that others do better and try to ably lesson learned to own working . 
  do you want a strike ? 
  because that 's how you get a strike ( in france ) . 
  all those kinds of maps mostly highlight `` who really cares about something '' . 
  this is the best description of the us i have seen !, 
  rip adidas . 
  dutch speaking belgians hating french speaking belgians and english people being anti-french ? 
  you do n't say ? 
  i can speak belgian french , swiss french and canadian french . 
  ok , i can just fake the accents very poorly , but that must count ? 
  right ? 
  french pronunciation is pretty logical , but it 's spelling is a million times harder than english . 
  there is always dozens of different ways of spelling the same sound . 
  if you think english is hard to spell , try french !, 
  he 's not talking about ireland !, 
  what you see as replies to his post is butthurt brits . 
  sang not produced . 
  and he 's an [ atheist ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nbrnkup.jpg ) even after having met a few gods . 
  oui yes si ja, 
  that might be true for individuals , but is it true for industry prices too ? 
  i am not sure how it works in the netherlands . 
  there 's certainly some area of france ( around narbonne for intense ) that are constantly windy . 
  there 's a massive room for improvement . 
  because of cheap natural gas ? 
   one third of the senate was to be renewed today . 
  half in fact . 
  le caylar is such a remote place . 
  wtf were they doing there ? 
  [ wikipedia.fr ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_pr\u00e9noms_les_plus_donn\u00e9s_en_france ) confirms it 's emma and does not even list ellen/h \u00e9l\u00e8ne in the top 20 . 
  is there any girl not named maria in portugal ? 
  then kid number 1 : 1 kid number 2 : 2, 
  * unconditional love of camping * cheap * horrible lunches * obsessed with milk and putting things on bread * can not imagine why people have something warm for lunch * tall and blond * think they are ecologically minded ( though they are not ), 
  the first time i met hungarian people , they mentioned the trianon agreements to me . 
  the first time ( that was 25 years ago ) . 
  i had to ask them what it was since i had no clue . 
  that may be the biggest difference with france . 
  ballot papers are locally counted and the results sent ( by phone i believe ) to the `` pr\u00e9fecture '' . 
  the ballot papers are then sent somewhere for storage and possible re-counting . 
  same in france , but the full results are known 3 or ( max ) 4 hours after closing time . 
  here it seems it can take up to 7 hours . 
  why does it take so long to count votes ?
