  sorry about the sncf . 
  if you think it is hard for you , imagine how hard it is for the people that , daily , rely on it . 
  especially the train drivers are a bunch of entitled morons who do n't give a shit about others . 
  when they strike , it hurst everyone . 
  they do n't care . 
  if you have a solution to stop those idiots , please tell us . 
  in the column `` supplier '' you can click on a country 's name and see the details for that country . 
  the issue with this data is that `` miscellaneous '' seems to often be the largest category by far , which is not very informative . 
  it is bigger for consoles , see [ wikipedia link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/console_wars#worldwide_sales_figures_6 ) . 
  the big difference is that evolution is science , creationism or theistic evolution are myths . 
  i 'd rather schools and museums teach science . 
  my family name comes from there . 
  a lot of people immigrated from malta . 
  i visited the place once . 
  national dish is rabbit !, 
  super catholics !, 
  the oldest remains of stone-based building in the world are there !, 
  ( from a civilisation that completely disappeared ) english is spoken everywhere . 
  the national language is based on arabic . 
  edit : [ photo ] ( http://imgur.com/u0z1vfm ) taken about 10 years ago at a natural history museum in malta, 
  china makes [ more wine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wine_producing_countries ) than portugal !, 
  not all do . 
  in fact most certainly do n't . 
  [ french gov ] ( http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/composition-du-gouvernement ) ( nsfw in the sense that work is disappearing in france . ), 
  it was feasible when i did my `` bac '' and that was in the mid eighties . 
  where is morrissey when you need him ? 
  denmark , why are so many people living in `` other '' type of dwelling ? 
  what do they mean by other ? 
  boat , caravan , tree , mermaid ? 
  or erwtensoep which can be delicious . 
  it 's pretty easy though . 
  2 vegs for lunch , 2 vegs for dinner and a fruit somewhere ? 
  how is that hard ? 
  we should start calling it that though . 
  i just heard on the radio that montpellier won the european gay rugby cup !, 
  true . 
  but it is not the case . 
  i 've lived there several years , married a local girl and still goes to the netherlands 6 or so times a year to visit the family in law . 
  so i would say my experience of the country is rather extensive . 
  journalistic exaggeration . 
  apparently , montpellier is the most gay-friendly city in france ( heard this on the radio this morning ) . 
  but calling it san francisco is ridiculous . 
  the way foreigners have to wait for hours is a total disgrace . 
  lunch in the netherlands . 
  i use to work for a large company there and lunch time was so monotonous : every single dutch person ate little shitty sandwiches , a fruit and drank milk . 
  every single one . 
  it 's like wanting something else to eat or drink was not allowed . 
  i once asked for water and was told that i did not need water since there 's milk !, 
  the uniformity and monotony of it was depressing . 
  about the same for usa , france and sweden . 
  edit : to clarify : 5m/300m ~ 876k/65m ~ 146k/10m the others , i.e. 
  germany , canada , uk , italy have much less asylum seekers than the 3 above . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asylum_seekers#asylum_seekers ) : country total asylum seekers 2007 to 2011 [ 46 ] united states 5098,850 france 876,890 germany 155,970 canada 147,000 sweden 146,380 united kingdom 138,350 italy 106,140, 
  fuck the english , when did they become relevan ... 
  sorry , my french side took over for a second . 
  love you , chaps !, 
   the french characterize themselves as both the most arrogant and the least arrogant . 
  what can i say ... 
  there is so much hysteria surrounding monsanto and gmos that it 's difficult to separate the facts from the huge amount of propaganda from both sides . 
  i hate monsanto as much as anybody , but there has been no case of farmers being sued by monsanto due to cross pollination . 
  there are plenty of horrible things that monsanto has done and is doing without adding a fake one . 
  traditionally , farmers have kept some seeds produced one year to plant them the following year . 
  this is still done all over the world . 
  if you buy monsanto seeds , you are not allowed to replant them the following year . 
  you might find it unfair , but if you disagree , just do not buy monsanto seeds . 
  the main issue for farmers , is that some have to buy monsanto seeds for multiple reasons . 
  they are stuck . 
  you wrote :  no ... 
  i do n't mean to say that any party is always fault ... but when the state thinks that racial segregation is acceptable ... then we went wrong somewhere . 
  the article says :  sncf initially blamed the discrimination on `` security protocol '' advised by the french interior ministry and the israeli embassy in paris , but this has been emphatically denied by both . 
  instead , the order came from sncf management , with a spokesman for the state-run company pledging `` a full investigation '' . 
  `` the state '' does not seem responsible !, 
  i think the economist is on a personal vendetta against france . 
  just type `` the economist '' bashing france in google and you 'll get lots of hits . 
  personally , i criticise my own country more than anyone , and i am in no way afraid of criticism . 
  regarding the languages , there are more people speaking spanish than french , but a very large part of the african continent speaks french ( even as a second language ) . 
  this continent is probably going to be very important in the near future , particularly for europe . 
  i 'd rather they could express themselves clearly in english or french . 
  spanish is important for the americas , certainly , less for europe ( spain excluded ) .

  thanks reddit is fun for sending my post 3 times ! ... . 
  let 's not forget that this is `` the economist '' , a magazine that hates france . 
  i am not kidding here , they bash france as soon as they can . 
  they might have a good argument , but i 'd rather hear it from someone else . 
  without getting into the pro vs. cons of nuclear power , i wonder if the data shown in the article is positive due to the economic crisis and the slow down of industries . 
  ~ ~ biologically speaking , there 's a little bit more females than men , so i guess that france is rather normal and the map highlights abnormalities . ~ ~ sorry , got it the other way around !, 
  i confirm this as accurate . 
  people of europe , leave our women alone . 
  much appreciated , france, 
  http://www.eupedia.com/forum/threads/24377-diversity-of-surnames-in-european-countries i was maybe wrong about japan . 
  probably more than the usa . 
  france has had lots of immigrants too from portugal , poland , italy to name a few . 
  the second country in terms of family name is japan . 
  little known fact : france has more family names than any other country in the world .
