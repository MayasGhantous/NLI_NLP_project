  due to several factors , including the fact that we have had family names for longer than most , misspellings , multiple regional languages , ... 
  so even though martin is the most common name , it is not really that common . 
  having a plan for the long term future . 
  a plan , that citizens of europe will agree with . 
  that plan is either lacking or is obscure and mostly unknown . 
  welcome to my world !, 
  sorry , you are right , i used monthly vs yearly values . 
  though it sounds like utopia , it could make sense . 
  it 's a bit similar to proposals making all public transport free . 
  since they are heavily subsidised anyway , the cost of making tickets , paying people to sell tickets , controllers , ... is not much lower than the amount of money paid by users directly . 
  so imagine if everyone was paid , say , 800 euros . 
  that 's not much , but you could barely survive with it ( at least in richer euro countries ) . 
  currently , for france , welfare spending is 500b euros . 
  800euros * 65 m people = 52b . 
  it 's just 10 % and it would cut down a huge amount of bureaucracy and complexity . 
  again , i am not saying it 's good or feasible , but it is interesting . 
  there 's going to be lots of stripping of citizenship in the dutch bible belt then . 
  to put things in perspective , here are a few things i heard on french radio by journalists , ministers , ... * there are big problems getting people to pay taxes in cyprus ( meaning a tax increase will not work well ) * 45 % of all bank deposits are from non-residents ( extremely high number relative to anywhere else in eu ) * banks use to propose rates of up to 10 % / year on deposits ( crazy relative to anywhere else in eu ) all those things make me think that people in cyprus and elsewhere have benefited a lot from a corrupt banking system which is now on the verge of collapsing . 
  the fact that a levy is proposed makes sense if all those bullet points above are true ( i do not know if they are ) . 
  there 's been a trend in lower and lower fatalities due to car accidents in the last few years ( 10 or 20 years ) . 
  it 's mostly due to the awesomeness of car security features ( crumbling zone , airbags , seat belts , ... ) than anything else . 
  i also can not wait for self-driving cars !, 
  horrible headline . 
  it might be true , but there is no proof yet . 
  they start the article by claiming 2 execs from lvmh are leaving france , and finish the article by saying that one of them is belgian and his family is in london , and the second one is retiring this year . 
  that 's the best `` proof '' they have ? 
  anti-christianity , really !, 
  has that ever been an issue in / r/europe or are you trying to make it an issue ? 
  we love you , ecosse . 
  i guess it 's correlated to skin tone , geography and willingness/ability to go on holiday to sunny places to bake under the sun . 
  i think this is deep in the british psyche . 
  for others , horses are not pets . 
  note : why is parent post downvoted ? 
  do not downvote if you disagree !, 
  downvote if it 's an inane or worthless comment . 
  the [ full letter ] ( http://www.lesechos.fr/economie-politique/france/document/0202577006715-goodyear-la-lettre-de-titan-a-montebourg-540115.php ) . 
  the important part is that he 's saying that the chinese export tires all over europe ( made by cheap labour and subsidised by the chinese state ) and nobody 's doing anything about it . 
  that 's the part that hurts . 
  i am not naive . 
  i would have agreed with you about senegal , ivory coast , tunisia and so on ; but mali was , i think , pretty obvious . 
  france has close to no economic or financial interests in mali . 
  protecting the 10k or so french and eu citizens there and stopping the progress of islamists forces were / are the only interests the french government has . 
  i am sure other eu countries can easily agree to this !, 
  look at france . 
  one of the most secular country in the world and religion has all but disappeared . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  he 's ( was ) a different voice . 
  wrong . 
  there are for instance a couple millions hunters in france . 
  they all own rifles . 
  so guns might have been the wrong term , but firearms then . 
  the other big difference is the reason for gun death . 
  a lot of us gun death are due to criminal profit , a lot of eu gun death are due to family or other feud ( neighbors , friends , ... ) . 
  i read this a few years ago in a book on criminality . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  but the sex was great !, 
  i 'd say it 's both england and germany . 
  the good news is that we are now getting along fine with germany . 
  i have a very hard time believing this . 
  france use to be one of the slimmest in europe and now we are suddenly one of the fattest ? 
   taking the good and the ~ ~ bad ~ ~ ** worst ** gets left behind to history ( sometimes slowly ) . 
  we ( thankfully ) left behind most of our ** british food ** traditions . 
  using the percentages as a proportion of the current population of france , that would mean 2.8 m people dead . 
   unfortunately you might not exist otherwise . 
  about the smoking part : the article went on and on about smoking , but at the very end , quickly mentions that denmark has the second lowest rate of smokers in europe ( after iceland ) . 
  so the lower life expectancy for women in denmark is unlikely to be linked to smoking ( though it could be , stats are weird ) . 
  super [ easy ] ( https://failures.wikispaces.com/terminal+2e+at+charles+de+gaulle+airport ) !, 
  it 's a british stereotype . 
  who the hell is using `` mn '' for millions ? 
  stupid infographic people !, 
  for the france-italy match , last saturday , i made some pizzas for the family . 
  i 'd like to do something similar for wednesday match ( france-romania ) , but i have no idea about romanian cuisine . 
  help , please . 
  edit : that 's for the rugby world cup , by the way . 
   france is a diverse country , this is due to its large geographic area and regional differences as well as being a consequence of immigration resulting from france 's colonial past . 
  despite this , attitudes to foreigners vary but in general , the french are not very tolerant of foreigners . 
  for example , wearing of a full head covering veil in public is banned by law whether you are french or not -- the principle of french la\u00efcit\u00e9 states that nobody can show their religion publicly . 
  the ( official ) reason for the banishment of the full head covering is security . 
  completely false !, 
  this is total bullshit . 
  indeed , well done georgia !, 
  most of our food does not contain frogs or snails . 
  also those ingredients are not exclusively found in french cuisine and are in fact pretty common in many countries around the mediterranean and elsewhere . 
  your taste buds seem to have been damaged by bland british food . 
  it 's unfortunate . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  this guy was fleeing france , not war . 
  he took a massive risk to go to the uk when he was perfectly safe in france and probably italy or greece before that . 
  lol . 
  a lot of the world 's top chefs are famous for their cooking mastery , not their english cuisine . 
  as a matter of fact , we have two right now . 
  if you can read russian . 
  nobody burn my neighbourhood . 
  some africans . 
  the french speaking part of africa wants to move to france , the old british colony ones want to move to the uk . 
  though i more or less agree with him , it 's a bit hypocritical coming from a pole to talk about immigration ( especially refugees ) to france : [ poles in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_minority_in_france ), 
  thank you mods for doing this . 
  i hate when a thread is removed because the article/title changed and the whole discussion is gone . 
  it 's interesting on a french viewpoint , since there is no religious exception in the law in france ( afaik ) . 
  there is only a hand full of sikhs in france and they complained a few years ago that they could not have their ceremonial knife with them at school .
