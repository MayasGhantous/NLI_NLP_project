  france 's constitution allows temporary measures in case of immediate and grave danger . 
  however those measures are extreme and only valid if france is attacked and in danger of being invaded ( all power goes to the president or to the army ) . 
  there is nothing in between peace and full war , basically . 
  what hollande is proposing is something that would temporarily give extra power to different administrations in case of terrorist acts . 
  honestly i think this will not change anything , but he 's got to be seen as a leader . 
  he sais `` chocolatine '' . 
  he 's obvious a freak from the fringes of france . 
  it 's obviously the eu 's fault . 
  obviously the piece of water between france and you had nothing to do with it . 
  german tanks are well known for their boating capabilities . 
   the majority of wars theyve fought you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  you are right . 
  we are blinded by our small differences . 
  how quickly do you forget your army fleeing to dunkirk !, 
  i hope so . 
  i totally understand , and believe me , i am not a homophobe . 
  however , as i wrote about living in england in the 90 's , it 's just simple stats . 
  risks factors are by definition discriminatory . 
  but you are looking at this from only your point . 
  you have to look at it statistically . 
  boudin in french . 
  it exists almost everywhere in europe . 
  it 's such political correctness bullshit . 
  12 months abstinence is not going to happen . 
  i can not give my blood because i lived in england in the early 90 's . 
  do i protest and complain because the rosbeefs tried to kill me ? 
  there is no fairness in the medical world , just facts and statistics . 
  actually i read something else . 
  to french in english use to mean to cut in small cuts . 
  so it makes sense for `` frites '' . 
  in the netherlands , `` patat '' is most probably a short version of `` patates frites '' , i.e. 
  fried potatoes . 
  by dutch invention , you mean created by the philips company . 
  am i right ? 
  what we are famous for : * french fries ( probably not french but belgian ) * croissants ( austrian ) what most people think is not french , but it is : * the cinema * antibiotics * first flight ( hot air balloon ) * first theory of evolution ( lamarck was mostly wrong , but it is the first complete theory ), 
  same way in france . 
  we do n't do it the dutch way . 
  we do it this way : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3rr22o/apparently_theres_a_difference_in_the_way_the/cwqji00 as shown by / u/fnzombie . 
  the dutch way is horrible because it ends up looking like a \u221e ( infinite sign ) most of the time . 
  as a brit i laughed so much at this !, 
  now i will go back to drinking my tea and raping some kid . 
  i was invited to give a talk at the swiss patent office a few years ago . 
  some people were late . 
  i started my talk by jokingly mentioning that i had not expected swiss people to be late . 
  several people said that they were not swiss . 
  i guess that 's pretty true of many businesses in switzerland , they heavily depend on foreigners . 
  you have the worst lunch food in the entire world . 
  each time i talked to french people who have lived in the netherlands ( like i have ) , the first thing they mention is how much the food ( and especially lunches ) sucked . 
  not as fucked up as the rest of ex-yugoslavia ? 
  whoa !, 
  this is so weird to me . 
  i have never seen a private home/apartment with a door opening outwards . 
  ca n't you see the difference between your own government spying on you and a foreign government doing it ? 
  at least you have a say in what your own government is doing . 
   our socialist government has gone full retard and is now pro-liberal anti- `` everything the left has always stood for '' so i 'm not sure i should laugh at you though lol wat ? 
  you must be one of those melenchon supporters to say some crap like that . 
  nobody cares in france except the french ambassador . 
  but as the title says , `` france '' is mad . 
  edit : except not accept !, 
  as far as i understood the new eu rulings , fast lanes only apply ( optionally ) to an extremely limited number of life-or-death situations ( remote surgery and the likes ) . 
  it does not apply to netflix or itunes or whatever entertainment business . 
  am i wrong ? 
   now there will be an even bigger exodus of eu start-up to the us , considering any big player can just pay an isp to prioritise their traffic over smaller companies . 
  why do you think it is better in the us ? 
  so edgy !, 
  you 'll be shocked by [ oskar lafontaine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oskar_lafontaine ) , then . 
  depends really . 
  `` i need to call dominique . 
  do you have her/his number ? '', 
  gender is clear in english and ( i think ) german . 
  `` il faut que j' appelle dominique . 
  no gender ( the word `` son '' indicates the masculin gender of the word `` num\u00e9ro '' , not the person ) . 
  we got rid of those over 200 years ago . 
   also the first name must be clearly identifying the gender . 
  that 's certainly not the case in france ( dominique for instance ) . 
  i was not sure it was a joke . 
  it 's hard in this sub to understand if people are joking or surprised by the use of a word ( especially those with a confusing flair like yours ) . 
  and you are right , i should have used stigma . 
  the french word being `` stigmate '' , i wrote stigmata without thinking . 
  stigma \u02c8st\u026a\u0261m\u0259 / noun plural noun : stigmata 1 . a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance , quality , or person . 
  `` the stigma of mental disorder '' synonyms : shame , disgrace , dishonour ; more, 
  the article mentions it 's due to civil partnerships , but the truth is hardly anyone bothered to get married in france for a while , even before civil partnerships existed . 
  i think there are several factors in play ( no real data ) : * strong anti church feelings ( since the revolution ) , i.e. 
  no religious need to get married * women tend to work full time , i.e. 
  separation is easier financially ( contrast with germany and the netherlands ) * no stigmata attached to living with someone without being married ( nobody cares ) and having kids . 
  * you can work full time , have kids and not be married . 
  most of the married people i know did it for tax reasons . 
  if you are married and one of the 2 spouses earns much less than the other , it is very advantageous to get married . 
   close the borders closing the mediterranean sea is pretty hard . 
  that 's where we should start . 
  i did not say ` commit to a hospital ' . 
  if the guy thinks he should see a doctor , who are you to say otherwise ? 
  well , not in france . 
  doctors , here , tend to give medications like sweet . 
  this is incredibly stupid . 
  how the fuck are you supposed to go to a hospital on your own with a broken arm ? 
  i broke my arm when i was young and it hurt like hell . 
   he should go to a physio therapist on his own account . 
  and how do you do that when you do n't know the country , can not walk much , do n't speak the language , do n't know how a modern country works , do n't know what a physic therapist is ( maybe ) . 
  if you are dutch , think about it .
