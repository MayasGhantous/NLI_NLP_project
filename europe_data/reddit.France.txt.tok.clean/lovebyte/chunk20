  just go to a random doctor claiming you are a refugee . 
  what do you think would happen ? 
  i have been very critical of the refugees , but here , i think , they have some good points . 
  if the temperature in nijmegen is similar to the one in paris today , it 's very close to freezing in the morning . 
  they should be provided with better blankets and coats . 
  it 's unacceptable to have kids being cold at night . 
  also a guy who faints and has some neck pains can have a serious condition and he should be examined seriously . 
  finally , if they find the food too bland or repetitive , well , welcome to the netherlands where the food is bland and repetitive . 
  i understand your frustration , but one bad experience with a shitty company does not mean all french companies are bad ( same for other countries ) . 
  because of my work , past and present , i have worked with companies from many different countries . 
  people are different , work attitudes are different and communication is not always optimum . 
  and those things vary , from country to country but also from company to company within one country and from people to people within one company . 
   few measure up against the french , but precision is not your strong suit ... 
  i had a problem with my bmw recently , it 's the proof that german engineering sucks !, 
  let 's not generalise , please !, 
  basically , in france , they are virtually phased out . 
  i believe it is still allowed to sell them up to 40w . 
  i bought some on amazon.fr because i need them for my lava lamp !, 
  as op mentioned fip radio is awesome . 
  according to them , they hardly ever play the same song twice , which means that they might be the radio playing the most songs in the world . 
  also worth mentioning [ oui fm ] ( http://www.ouifm.fr ) which is a rock radio . 
  their website allows you to listen to different types of rock . 
  finally , [ nova ] ( http://www.novaplanet.com ) is one of the oldest fm radio in france and has been at the avant garde of world music for decades . 
  well , the ** town ** of carcassonne is not great either . 
  the ** city of carcassonne ** is gorgeous . 
  we need euro gays to be tested for their gaydar . 
  the best ones can then be used to screen gay refugees . 
  it 's pretty easy , really . 
  this is not completely related to globalisation . 
  when railway workers or teachers ( or to some great extend air france pilots ) go on strike , they do n't do it because of competition or globalisation . 
  they do it because : * it 's in their culture * they want to preserve what they have ( even if everyone else makes an effort ) * the union to management discussions are not well done in fact , france gets a ( justified ) bad reputation on strikes , but it is always either transport workers , teachers or farmers . 
  hardly anyone else strikes and the number of days lost to strikes in france is not particularly high ( and gasp !, 
  comparable to the usa ! ), 
  as a native of this horrible town and someone who lived in the exact horrible street mentioned in the article , b\u00e9ziers and in particular this `` quartier '' is a piece of crap that should be nuked . 
   french people hate globalisation and americans are obese religious extremist firing guns all the time . 
  let 's generalise !, 
   swing low is fecking irritating i doubt they 'll sing it often now . 
  having lived in the netherlands and having visited belgium countless times , i 'd say the only question you should ask yourself is this one : do you enjoy food ? 
  if the answer is yes , go to belgium . 
  if you think food is only there to sustain life , go to the netherlands . 
  i 'd add that if you go to boston right now , you will feel right at home weather wise . 
  source : i am in boston right now . 
  americans are the main reason for this . 
  and how on earth is france 20th in global contribution to culture when denmark is 2nd ( no offence !, 
   today , it is more important than ever to strengthen transatlantic relations . 
  i am not sure about that . 
  like them or not , they are a lot less bad than le pen . 
  i really hate this attitude . 
  democracy is not about getting what you want , but about going in the direction that is the least bad for you and others . 
  edit : by democracy i meant voting . 
  obviously campaign for what you believe ; it is not the same when you vote for a limited choice of candidates . 
  ridiculous . 
  even if le pen is elected which is virtually impossible , the fn will not control the parliament . 
  that 's the key for a government . 
  france is a popular place of death for artists : * picasso * leonardo da vinci * oscar wilde * chopin * van gogh * rousseau, 
  i am so confused now . 
  stop it , please . 
  and sexiness ( strangely or not . 
  i do n't know anymore ) . 
  no we are not . 
  culturally we are in between latin and germanic areas . 
  the only thing i canned was [ mirabelle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirabelle_plum ) jam made from my mirabelle tree . 
  we had to stop the kids from eating all the fruits and what was left was either given to friends or made as jam . 
  it 's one of the most delicious fruit , but sadly only known in france and parts of germany . 
  indeed . 
  i like him . 
  he 's funny , but it might be too hard for germans to see !, 
  you are right . 
  i meant to say widespread in labs working on genetic modifications , labs doing research obviously . 
  i do n't buy what you wrote . 
  it 's a major issue in bioethics , not a technological one . 
  the use of crispr-cas9 is now wide spread in laboratories , but its use on human embryos is a big taboo . 
  i am not arguing for or against it , just stating facts . 
  this is beside the point . 
  what happened to you in your school in austria might not be what happened to others in austria or elsewhere . 
   grab a handful a hand-full if she 's lucky !, 
  i thought it was cold in iceland . 
  he means that exaggerate would suffice . 
  the only times i have heard of issues with the teaching of evolution in france , in the last few years , was with young muslims at schools . 
   countries like canada , the uk and the united states have the highest rate of inter-racial and inter-ethnic marriages in the world , just for example . 
  i 'll need a reference for that . 
  `` inter-racial '' marriages are very common in france too , but there are no stats about them . 
  bayer does not . 
  they have bayer crop sciences which is relatively modest and a lot smaller than the gmo component of monsanto . 
  also bayer can not test their gmo seeds in europe ( or with a lot of difficulties and not everywhere ) . 
  what is ridiculous ? 
  edit : the link above mostly shows pesticides production and does not show gmos from bayer . 
  but believe what you want . 
  this is what happens when you all but ban gmos . 
  european companies go elsewhere . 
  bayer could have invested more in europe , but they did not . 
  edit : you do n't have to believe me ; i am just a specialist in the domain who talks to people from bayer , basf , monsanto , syngenta , dupont on a daily basis . 
  i remember in the 90 's , some english people from s *** cunt *** horpe could not use their address to subscribe to aol . 
  fb is as stupid as aol . 
  ethiopia would own half the world . 
  actually , 90 non consecutive days is great for me . 
  i travel a lot for work and pleasure and 90 consecutive days does not make sense for me . 
   they 're hideously incorrect nothing beats blackpool , right ? 
  stop writing this . 
  it 's completely untrue .
