  all that for a jewish officer . 
  it 's always difficult to judge the past with the mindset of nowadays . 
  there certainly was some anti-semitism in france , but the french ~ ~ president ~ ~ `` pr\u00e9sident du conseil des ministres '' ( more like prime minister ) was jewish just before wwii . 
  so `` massively '' anti-semitic is an exaggeration . 
  edit : not really president , but almost . 
  an article full of bullshit but with a little truth in it . 
  not bad for the telegraph . 
  vapor cook it . 
  that 's what i do . 
  true . 
  they did not flee to dunkirk either . 
  please , learn about history before commenting on it . 
  they are the most successful french ex-colony . 
  oh please , do n't fuck this up !, 
  i live very close to this area and i want it to be a success . 
  for people on the extreme left , everyone else is either right wing or extreme right . 
  i lived in the netherlands . 
  i wanted to throw away your so-called food everyday !, 
  it was a joke . 
  tip : do n't call a welsh person english . 
  you could lose body parts . 
  depends . 
  if the french voters discover she 's welsh , then yes . 
  and there 's hollande in france . 
  ( just kidding ! ), 
  make france grate again ? 
  the epo and the eu are unrelated . 
  the eu has no power over the epo . 
  when i lived in england , in the 90 's , it was still illegal for two men to kiss in the streets . 
  england has been very repressing of homosexuals in the past . 
  france , on the other hand , made homosexuality legal over 200 years ago . 
  do n't worry . 
  i met some very nice hungarian people when living in england . 
  i went to visit them in hungary and had a great time . 
  the *** very first time *** i met hungarians , they mentioned the trianon treaty . 
  i honestly had no idea what they were talking about . 
  this was the first ever school shooting in france . 
  it reminds me of george mikes book on england ( `` how to be an alien '' ) . 
  the very short chapter on sex :  continental people have sex lives ; the english have hot-water bottles . 
   censorship is back in cinema ( blue is the warmest color lost its right to be shown in cinemas although it won the palme d'or in cannes ) let 's not go crazy here . 
  the -12 rating has been appealed . 
  it 's not banned . 
  france had a very low age rating relative to other countries . 
  here are the imdb worldwide ratings : argentina :16 / australia : r18 + / belgium :16 / brazil :18 / canada : r ( alberta/british columbia/manitoba/ontario ) / canada :16 + ( qu\u00e9bec ) / chile :18 / czech republic :15 / denmark :15 / finland : k-16 / france :12 ( with warning ) / germany :16 / hong kong : iii / hungary :18 / ireland :18 / italy : vm14 / japan : r18 + / japan : r15 + ( cut version ) / malaysia : ( banned ) / mexico : c / netherlands :16 / new zealand : r18 / norway :15 / portugal : m/16 / russia :18 + / singapore : r21 ( cut ) / south korea :18 / spain :16 / sweden :15 / switzerland :16 / uk :18 / usa : nc-17 ( certificate # 48596 ), 
  i read a few years ago that germany was losing 100k people in age of being employed per year because of very low demographics . 
  france gains 400k per year . 
  which means france has to find 1/2 a million more new jobs per year than germany . 
  that 's one important aspect of the unemployment rate in france vs. germany . 
  obviously there are many others such as the fact that 1/5 of employees are public servants . 
  not a peace nobel , but a nobel prize for literature . 
  i read a variant where he said dutch to my horse . 
  we lost our last desert in 1962 when algeria became independent . 
  additionally , the french nuclear weapons are not dependent on the usa , the british ones are . 
  france is the obvious choice there . 
  i was joking !, 
  state money is given to historical church buildings , not to churches or religions . 
  the alleged attacker has been arrested . 
  the [ only information on him ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2017/08/09/01016-20170809artfig00056-six-militaires-renverses-a-levallois-perret-le-vehicule-en-fuite-est-recherche.php ) i can find is that he was born in 1980 . 
  probably because nobody makes babies in germany , at all , ever . 
  leibnitz , newton were well ahead of their time . 
  on the other hand , darwin fell pressured to publish his origin of species because someone else was about to publish something similar . 
  and that 's the case for many scientists and discoveries . 
  ( reference : the scientists : a history of science told through the lives of its greatest inventors ) same goes with historical figures . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande could have easily been replaced , napoleon , hitler or stalin had a unique impact . 
  sure . 
  but some not . 
  ridiculous . 
  he was the first to get a printing machine right , but if he had not , someone else would most probably have done it a few years later . 
  i meant about nuclear testing . 
  exactly , the us and the soviet union did a lot worst . 
  it was pretty horrible . 
  however i see it as the workings of a healthy democracy . 
  there were debats , protests , ... 
  do n't you have extremely conservative protestant parties in nl ? 
  did n't they complain ? 
  i doubt you tasted the excellent beef produced in france and there 's plenty . 
  the american and british obsession with angus beef is a bit monotonous , though angus is great . 
  french charolais , aubrac , ... are also excellent . 
  yes , but they produced food palatable to locals , often in local factories . 
  if the only things they did were british and dutch food , they would not sell much outside of those markets . 
  let me put it this way . 
  in the 80s the bbc did an april fool where they showed the harvest of the spaghetti tree . 
  italians were picking up spaghetti from the tree , etc. . . 
  most brits believed it was true . 
  with the exception of meat , i do n't think we import much british food . 
  thank god !, 
  brits going crazy about some industrial canned food . 
  rocinante is not only popular due to don quixote but also due to the sci-fi series the expanse . 
  i guess that could explain it . 
  lol . 
  the difference between macron and may ( or cameron ) is that macron is proposing solutions and discussing them with merkel et al. 
  the strategy of blaming the eu and constantly whining is what brought brexit . 
  look , the minimum wage in poland is about 450 euros . 
  it is 1500 or so in france . 
  added to this , taxes and insurances are high in france . 
  a friend of mine is an independent painter ( the kind that paints houses , walls , ... ) . 
  he told me that to get minimum wage , he needs to be paid twice as much as a polish painter , including taxes , ... 
  it 's not a sustainable situation . 
  for almost every drug you take , there has been clinical trials showing the positive effects and the potential negative ones , but the exact way this drug works , the exact way the chemical reactions occur in your body and especially the reason why the molecule you are probably ingesting has more positive effects than negative ones is not done via a thorough knowledge of the human body , but by tests and statistics . 
  not by hard facts , but by testing on enough people .
