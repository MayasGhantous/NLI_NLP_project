  i dreamt of food . 
  i would take any opportunity to go to belgium ( 1 hour away from where i was ) . 
  healthy ? 
  there is no vegetable !, 
  it 's just bread ( i.e. 
  sugar ) and cheese/ham . 
  that 's not healthy . 
  when i worked in the netherlands in a big company , i swear 99 % of dutch people would eat what you describe every single day . 
  every non-dutch person would look at this in disgust . 
  it 's boring . 
  the worst is for those that would bring their own lunch , leave it at their desk/in their bag all morning . 
  now it 's been warm for 4 hours . 
   a group of mormon missionaries ... visible difficulties with formulating their thoughts that seems normal and unrelated to languages . 
  obviously farmers would be interested in the most profitable crops . 
  that 's exactly what farmers do right now !, 
  there is very little agricultural biodiversity in crops in 2017 . 
  why would gmos change that ? 
  regarding the farmed salmon escaping into the wild , there has been plenty and several studies on those . 
  it 's a serious issue . 
  but again , it 's unrelated to gmos . 
   but mutation is gene by gene lol . 
  you do not know what you are talking about . 
  i do n't understand what you are saying . 
  are you saying that gmos will suddenly grow like crazy in the wild and will destroy other planted seeds ? 
  when has this ever happened ? 
  the term dangerous is relative . 
  anything we do is potentially dangerous . 
  say , you find a new spring . 
  you test it for known dangerous chemicals and it 's all fine . 
  you can never be 100 % certain that it is safe . 
  however , you will allow the spring to be bottled , for instance , and sold . 
  what is the difference with gmos ? 
  i never said it was never dangerous . 
  i am just saying it is as dangerous as many other things that we allow . 
  do you thing that peanuts or celery should be allowed ? 
  they are very dangerous for some people and if they were dangerous because they had been gmos , they would not be allowed . 
  the hysteria about gmos has absolutely no base in reality . 
  nobody ever died because they ate gmos . 
   the fact that the farmer is now dependent on the company ca n't be denied . 
  as / u/junkeregge wrote , they are willing to be dependent because it 's profitable to them . 
  they are many seeds that farmers can choose from . 
  it 's been estimated that 1 billion people have eaten gmo food . 
  number of death : 0 . 
  you are mixing up so many things !, 
  prions are totally unrelated to gmos . 
  in the past 200 years , we have subjected plants to massive amounts of radiations , massive amounts of chemicals to make them mutate faster in the hope they develop interesting/useful traits . 
  how is that `` natural '' ? 
  also where do you get the idea that `` placing whole genetic sequences in a new surrounding '' is dangerous ? 
  a few genes are taken from one species and put in another one . 
  this is done in labs , obviously , but as you said , `` horizontal gene transfer '' exists in nature too . 
   i 'm eating natural food good luck finding that . 
  we have been tinkering with plants and animals for hundreds of years . 
  nothing we eat is natural . 
  gmos are just a controlled version of the random seed crossing we have done in the past . 
  as you can see from the downvote you get , it is impossible to argue with anti-gmo people with scientific facts . 
  they will make them up to fit their narrative . 
  see for instance the golden rice story where greenpeace made up some ridiculous facts . 
  the r\u00e9union island . 
  just type `` patisserie '' in google image . 
  everything is delicious . 
  my favourite being a mille feuille . 
  true . 
  i did not mean it this way . 
  love from france . 
  look , guys , they got one engineer , the son of a frenchman , who tried to go to a french engineering school , but sadly , was not admitted . 
  but you wo n't find any bougnette there !, 
   louis xiv being probably the most loved overall what ? 
  i do n't think anybody loves louis xiv . 
  greatest leader : napol\u00e9on worst leader : napol\u00e9on, 
  nobody seems to have mention this american one with [ buffalo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo ) . 
  or this [ chinese poem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vexjnn_3ep4 ) . 
   for leaving without goodbyes we use idiom '' \u0443\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e-\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438 '' ( to leave english style ) . 
  filer \u00e0 l'anglaise = french leave, 
  if you like warm weather , you should definitely look at companies in the sophia antipolis area . 
  it 's close the the city of nice in south of france and has a lot of research and it companies . 
  the reverse for me . 
  when i lived in the netherlands i hated the fact that people expected me to say my name when answering . 
  if someone calls you , they should introduce themselves , not you . 
  do you go in the street , meet someone you do n't know and say `` what 's your name ? '', 
  no it 's absurd . 
  soixante-huitards ? 
  lol, 
   edit : or , my personal preference , which is `` the cooperative lunar institute for technology , observation , and research in space '' . 
  one drawback with that - the abbrievation is c.l.i.t.o.r.i.s. 
  someone watched red dwarf !, 
  and there was the olympics too !, 
  in france , it 's probably because l'acgt is on strike again !, 
  since the name france comes from the franks which means free people , france literary means `` the land of the free '' . 
  the french handball player nikola karabatic is supposed to have been on a 1 million euros salary . 
  two friends are chatting , when suddenly a sports car with a big s on the hood rushes passed them , immediately followed by several police cars . 
  one of the two friends says `` whoa !, 
  did you see the s car go ? '', 
  it 's context dependent in french and so ambiguous . 
  i am not sure why you are being downvoted , because it is correct . 
  the law changed something like 10 years ago or so and the husband can take his wife 's name and vice versa . 
  i talk to too many americans . 
   rock : phoenix are n't those guys french ? 
   wow talking about cultural appropriation . 
  lol . 
  that does not mean anything .
