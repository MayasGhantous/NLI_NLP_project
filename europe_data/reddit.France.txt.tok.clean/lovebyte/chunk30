  the point is that this sauce might have been created , in france , during the dutch wars , hence its name and so might not be dutch . 
  there are other theories though . 
  nobody mentioned sauce hollandaise , which might come from the netherlands or be related to the dutch wars of the 16th century depending on different sources . 
  anyhow , it is very french nowadays . 
  also regarding strikes , it 's important to note that it is always the same people doing it . 
  workers from private companies are virtually never on strike ( with a few exceptions like taxi drivers recently ) . 
  1/5 of workers in france are employed by the state . 
  those are the ones going ont strike . 
  `` l'immobilisme '' . 
  in the last 40 years ( give or take 5 ) , successive french governments have done nothing but react , too late , to issues . 
  nothing changes ever . 
  the gigantic french administration suffocates any initiative . 
  also the general disdain and disinterest for science in france . 
  it 's all about the arts and artists with opinions on everything . 
  i have stopped watching tv 10 years ago , but i assume nothing has changed . 
  the first modern department store is [ le bon march\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_bon_march\u00e9 ) in paris . 
  it is still there . 
  you could try this : [ what gravitates around the earth ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekmtqodjrsi ), 
  yes , married . 
  for many french people , marriage is about lowering your taxes !, 
   the french anthem singing about washing the country with the blood of impure invaders oh god !, 
  this sentence is so badly interpreted nowadays . 
  i even heard people calling it racist , as if a `` french race '' existed or made sense . 
  they are talking about their own blood , impure as opposed to the alleged pure blood of the monarchy . 
  it 's about how the impure blood of the commoners will wash the fields , but others will replace them and keep on fighting for the people 's freedom . 
  it 's also not a day only about the wwi , but about all wars . 
  a bit like a veteran day . 
  well not really . 
  rugby is pretty old too and made popular in the uk and later france for the ruling classes , not the poor . 
  the austrian and german people love titles !, 
  france has a similar system and in france you have to take at least two . 
  an important aspect of this simple system is that the results are known in a matter of 2 or max 3 hours . 
  there is no ambiguity possible and people just need to manually count bits of paper . 
  i have done it several times and in less than one hour everything was counted and tallied . 
  i do not deny any of them , but i think it is stupid to not be allowed to deny one happened , even if denying any is incredibly idiotic . 
  in the article you link to , it says that this law was incompatible with the 1946 european convention on human rights . 
  it probably was not enforced for a century or so . 
  when i lived in the uk many years ago , i remembered thinking that i had never seen so many queues . 
  it seems that there is a lot more queuing to do in the uk than in france . 
  drinking outside ( what 's a picnic in a park without wine ? ), 
  not being shot by the police, 
  sort of . 
  the french type of debit cards however are real visa cards , so they can be used virtually anywhere . 
  in other countries , like the netherlands or the uk , debit cards can only be used locally . 
  that 's a huge difference . 
  edit : maybe people misunderstand me . 
  there are some countries where people get a debit card from their bank with very limited usage . 
  mostly atm of their bank and some/most shops in their country , sometimes other countries . 
  if it is a mastercard/visa it is likely to work in most places . 
  maestro is now pretty much everywhere , though that was not the case before . 
  it 's worse when you add one more digit . 
  131 is literally hundred one and thirty in german and dutch . 
  it does not completely hold up . 
  there are in fact less working days lost to strikes than in many other countries , though it depends on the year ( france is 10th in this [ graph ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/labor/strikes ) ) . 
  what makes strikes in france more visible is the transport strikes ( trains , air traffic control , air france pilots ) . 
  those are very highly visible and impactful to french people and tourists . 
  the us can be beyond stupid . 
  i was asked to show an id to buy cigarettes in the middle of nowhere in the us midwest . 
  i was over 40 . 
  that 's a whole new level of absurd . 
  i asked the guy in the service station why he needed to see my id . 
  he replied that they have to card anyone that look below 40 . 
  well that was flattering , but 40 really ? 
   it postpones hunger and is n't that the main purpose of food ? 
  typical northern european idea of what food is !, 
  old french one , loosely translated : `` to our women , our horses and those that mount them . '', 
  i travel several times a year to the boston ( usa ) and i always do it with icelandair . 
  the stop over in iceland is quick and since iceland is part of schengen , it has never taken more than 10mn to go through custom there . 
  earthquakes in nice too . 
  watching the walking dead made me think that since virtually all gardens in france are fenced , often with walls , it would be a lot safer than the usa . 
  i understand what you mean . 
  but it 's a losing battle you are fighting . 
  nobody but you cares , and that 's the way it now is . 
  so how do you propose we call chopin or [ this guy ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_poniatowski ) ? 
  ( i am kidding ), 
   if you agree , at least try to pronounce sk\u0142odowska ... why ? 
  i am not in any way denying that she is polish , but her name is not very important relative to her achievements . 
  she 's known in france as marie curie , probably because women took their husband 's name at the time . 
  besides , i have no clue how to pronounce sk\u0142odowska . 
  so why is it so important to you ? 
  [ cassoulet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cassoulet ), 
  marie curie came to france because as a woman she was not allowed to go to university in poland . 
  do n't blame us !, 
  quite different to the way it is taught in france . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.lapasserelle.com/cours-en-ligne/lire_ecrire/lecon_01/cursive_1.gif ) is an example i found on the net . 
  the n , m , z , r are different to what you show . 
  being food obsessed . 
  it does not matter if it is french food or not . 
  if you have a conversation where you say `` i only use ingredients from this place and utensils from this brand ; cook it for that long , ... '' , you are considered honorary french . 
  mind you that was 20 years ago , so things might have changed . 
  but since you are such a smart arse , a quick search on amazon.de : [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.de/reisef\u00fchrer-iseosee-diseo-interessantesten-ziele/dp/3943663140/ ) and the wonderful [ `` wanderf\u00fchrer '' ] ( https://www.amazon.de/mallorca-sch\u00f6nsten-k\u00fcsten--bergwanderungen-gps-tracks/dp/3763341226/ ) . 
  not sure who `` we '' is , but it 's irrelevant . 
  it can be a law all the same . 
  all men are born equal with regards to the law . 
  that 's what the french constitution says . 
  it 's irrelevant that you are born rich or poor , the law is the same for all . 
  obviously this is contradictory with a monarchy . 
   but we still have our gdp , so fuck the haters you sound like americans and their `` freedom ! '', 
  i found it : [ \u3061\u3093\u3061\u3093 ] ( https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/\u3061\u3093\u3061\u3093 ),
