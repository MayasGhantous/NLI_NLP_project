  maybe because there 's a lot more tourists in amsterdam than eastern germany . 
  for france ( and i am no specialist ) they are new caledonia , tahiti and mayotte . 
  i agree , the ds is more of a classic car than the 2cv . 
  also the traction avant and the citro\u00ebn sm are noticeable . 
  the highest mountain in europe is not there !, 
  like france and everyone else . 
  aldehyde dehydrogenase is the enzyme with an issue , not alcohol dehydrogenase . 
  because scotland has a lot of empty space , but that 's not the only issue . 
  have a [ look ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guiana_space_centre ) . 
  what ? 
  it needs to be close to the equator , which i think is not where ukraine is . 
  since it is all based on gallup polls asking people questions , i think that countries that traditionally give money to religious organisations are going to be high up in the list . 
  just my 2 cents . 
  you might be [ right ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neanderthal_anatomy#cold-adapted_theory ) , and i might be wrong . 
  i had heard of the large nose adaptation to cold weather a long time ago , but it might be the opposite in fact . 
  it 's not an adaptation to weather . 
  in fact it 's the reverse . 
  animals adapt to cold weather by having large noses , so that the air warms up before getting into the body . 
  that 's obvious in neanderthals for instance . 
  i love vermont !, 
  my point is that it 's a bit more important to know where serbia , for instance , is on a map than most us states . 
  that 's all . 
  there is a difference between us states and eu countries/nations . 
  and that big difference is history . 
  what , say , denmark or hungary have meant for the whole planet is very different to , say , north dakota or vermont . 
  this smells very fishy . 
  i can not believe this has happened . 
  in most people 's opinions , freedom of speech is never absolute . 
  there are things you are not allowed/should not be allowed to say . 
  that 's what / u/saltysomolon is saying , i think . 
  crying `` fire '' in a crowded theatre , insulting people , ... it 's hard to put a limit to freedom of speech , and that 's the issue . 
  saying it is absolute is not what most people would think . 
  and yes , libel is a limitation to freedom of speech , `` absolutely '' . 
  as europeans we should be able to travel in europe where ever the fuck we want without telling the police . 
  i love the idea too . 
  french : why do you strike so much ? 
  english : why ca n't you cook ? 
  germans : tell us a joke . 
  etc ... it would be lots of fun . 
  edit : that was a joke !, 
  indeed , though it might be a very minor issue in norway with a [ jewish population ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_population_by_country ) of 153 , it might be another story for france with ~ 600k . 
  let alone the muslim population . 
  if you are a european porn star and want to get on the us market , you need to cut the end off . 
  so true . 
  i remember when chirac re-started nuclear testing in the pacific . 
  i am old enough to recall how usenet became pure french hatred . 
  it was horrible . 
  no it is n't . 
  but as / r/pegasus _ 527 said , i wanted to show one , often ignored , aspect of france . 
  we are very pessimistic . 
  i work with people from all over europe and north america , and the french are always the least enthusiastic . 
  i really hate that . 
  relatedly , it 's also the anniversary of the death of [ charles de gaulle ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_de_gaulle ), 
  something foreigners tend not to know is that there are two basic types of croissants : croissant ordinaire and croissant au beurre . 
  the latter is much better and more expensive . 
  the former can be much cheaper and much less tasty . 
  i love this victor hugo quote . 
  what a man !, 
  he said `` ended up '' , not `` started with '', 
  / u/vbb200 is wrong . 
  nobody pays money for that . 
  this is so true !, 
  with the notable exception of the french handball team , all the rest are unbeatable one day and pathetic the next . 
  here we go . 
  i expect the best and the worst , mostly the worst . 
  wtf does that mean ? 
  how are european jews dick to everyone ? 
  there are many reasons why we suck at english . 
  one of the main reasons being we hate the fact that english is more important than french . 
  i 'll just leave [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfumw_mf5qc ) here . 
   pif gadget and rahan comics were big in romania , big in france too . 
  i remember having a replica rahan 's necklace when i was young . 
   later i was disappointed when i realized the french were quite indifferent to comics . 
  what ? 
  i thought us french read a lot of comics . 
  you can still find some in france but it is much less common than in my childhood in the 70s/80s . 
  also [ goldorak ! ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/goldorak ) . 
  that was such a huge thing . 
  it seems only you and i have read the article . 
  everyone else is commenting on the title alone . 
  having said that , the article is quite confusing . 
  nobody seems to have mentioned that georgia has a pretty good rugby team , currently ranked 16 in the world . 
  hey !, 
  i try my best !, 
   your right wing groups want to cozy up to america and israel to satisfy their blood lust against the non-white race you are a fucking idiot !, 
  those stats are not always very meaningful . 
  if you count the weekends , ie is very low . 
  if you count the work week , then ie is very high . 
  almost all corporations , especially large ones , in europe like in north america have ie and ie only as standard . 
  that makes their employees unhappy , but it does not give a fuck . 
  why so ? 
  at least in france you might be able to make the dgse and other french agencies stop this bullshit if you vote , protest , etc. . . you have no power against a foreign government spying on you . 
  by not buying us products , such as computer hardware ( see recent news on china not buying ibm hardware anymore after snowden 's releases ) , not using us services ( google , ... ) . 
  all those things might be hard to do for an individual , but are easier for companies . 
  hit them where it hurts , their wallets . 
  edit : ~ ~ imb ~ ~ ibm, 
  not for eu elections and local elections . 
  eu citizens are allowed to vote in their eu country of residence in those . 
  i voted in the nl for instance . 
  obviously not in general elections .
