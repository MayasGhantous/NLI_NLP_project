  luxembourg is an exception , but as / u/stereo said , you still can after a residency of 5 years . 
   this is a level not many `` adult '' trade unions operate on . 
  in france it is . 
  i said it in another thread a few weeks ago , french people like to protest . 
  it 's probably coming from our revolutionary ideals . 
  i think it is bad for the country as a whole and we are far away from the northern europe ( incl . 
  nl , de , ... ) idea of having unions to find a compromise and negotiate . 
  french unions exist to fight , not compromise . 
  in my youth ( a long time ago ) i participated in a couple of strikes while at school . 
  as / u/foxkilt says , it was a fun day out with no class . 
  i believe it is the only eu country where non-national eu members are not allowed to vote in local elections . 
  i do n't know the details of this dispute , but i think ( and i am not well informed on this subject ) often classroom performance is linked to improved results years after years and comparative results between disciplines / similar schools . 
  i have never heard of `` pure '' performance related pay levels in teaching . 
  nobody in france claimed that the french were the only people eating frog legs !, 
  for that matter , french people know croissants are originally from vienna ( hence the term viennoiserie for that kind of pastry ) and french fries are from belgium . 
  it 's a photo of an ad\u00e9lie penguin . 
  it 's obviously french nobility !, 
  you are welcome . 
  i realised recently that both our unofficial country symbols ( eiffel tower and statue of liberty ) were partly built by monsieur eiffel . 
  we have lots more in common than we sometimes think . 
  when sarkozy tried to do this ( immigration choisie ) , africans called him racist . 
  they say it was like the times of slavery , when the best slaves were chosen . 
  there is no winning with some people !, 
  yes . 
  it 's important to understand that superdupont is a comical super hero . 
  he 's totally paranoid and sees `` foreigners '' everywhere , part of the `` anti-france '' . 
  it 's not at all like captain america . 
  there are some us government activities used by or using some europeans : the nih , nasa and uspto for instance . 
  europeans wanting to patent inventions at the uspto might not be able to do it in the near future , people going to nih conferences or nih people going to eu conferences might be a problem , nasa collaborates with lots of eu entities and private companies so there might be delays , ... 
  no , if i recall properly , teachers were afraid , as usual , that all schools in france would not be treated equally . 
  the obsession with equality means we are using the lowest common denominator as a standard instead of pulling everything up . 
   maybe teachers , farmers or drivers know best what they need this is often the case . 
  so when a government wants to give schools more autonomy , guess fucking what ? 
  they go on strike !, 
  truck drivers and farmers do n't strike often and i tend to have sympathy for them . 
  the rest ( and you forgot teachers in your list ) are entitled selfish people . 
  i am fully supportive of unions and workers rights , but the french unions are just horrible . 
  government wants to do something , they go on strike , then the following government wants to do the reverse , they go on strike . 
  wtf ? 
  edit : i am not saying ** all ** teachers and train drivers are selfish , obviously . 
  interestingly there is a small area of france that has a low light pollution . 
  it 's called [ `` triangle noir du quercy '' ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/triangle_noir_du_quercy ) . 
  amateur astronomers in france like this place and lobby the local villages to keep the night light to a minimum . 
  `` however , some recent studies imply that the demerit in a correlation of a sample and an actual model is responsible for the degradation of the quality of inference and reliability of conclusions , but only if the premise of inter-relatedness could not be sufficiently decided '' it 's beautiful !, 
  replying to a 3 month old post !, 
  ok , buddy , i just happen to have a phd and i worked in genetics and genomics for the last 15 years . 
  i have seen evolution in bacteria . 
  the evidence is there . 
  car tuning ? 
  as a frenchman from the south of france who has lived in yorkshire and the netherlands , i understand you . 
  little annectode : when i arrived in yorkshire i wanted to visit the surroundings . 
  the first weekend it rained and i thought , never mind , i 'll go the next weekend . 
  the next weekend it rained , and so on . 
  after a while i realised that the south of france is not the same as the north of england . 
  the dutch would have an advantage !, 
  i think this is brittany , in france . 
  i believe this was a common theme in early green party members . 
  see for instead [ cohn-bendit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohn_bendit#pedophilia_debate ) . 
  this was already published on / r/europe 5 months ago . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1bi59j/number_of_women_per_100_men_in_the_age_group_2529/ ) edit : on my cake day , people dare downvoting me !, 
  do n't you have a soul , people of / r/europe ? 
  we know and like to protest . 
  when you see in the news that 100k people protested in france , you might think it 's huge , but in france that would be an ordinary protest size . 
  til : parties are illegal in germany and switzerland at some dates . 
  i had never heard about this . 
  twist : the witness was blind !, 
  god damn it !, 
  portuguese is the perfect language to sing . 
  it 's so nice to hear . 
  i am awfully jealous !, 
  yep , that sounds totally plausible . 
  that 's the way of all governments . 
  when something works , it must be taxed to death !, 
  this is in no way an attack on the norwegian gov. 
  which i know nothing about . 
  and the belarus police for arresting a one arm man for applauding !, 
  i kid you not !, 
  i am not a big fan of contemporary french music , but the best known sing in english : - daft punk - phoenix, 
  from what i read it 's mostly due to norwegian idiosyncrasies : the advantages of owning an electric car are numerous ( free parking , ... ) and the insane level of taxes on petrol cars make the tesla not so expensive ( relatively ) . 
   nothing more american then budweiser ah !, 
  that made me laugh . 
  [ budweiser ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser ) is not american , in fact . 
  the american budweiser is very different to the delicious czech original . 
  is that you ? 
  obviously i did not mean you were a nazi sympathizer !, 
  but life had changed a lot for everyone !, 
  this is easily forgotten . 
  food was rationed , `` sto '' meant that all young men had to leave home for german factories and farms , people were taken away , ... 
  so , no , i respectfully disagree , life just did not simply go on for anyone . 
   it shows that for the majority of the people life just went on . 
  it 's propaganda . 
  it shows only what it wants to show . 
  and this is easily forgotten because those photos are pretty good . 
  you see a photo of a pretty girl smiling and you miss the fact that her best friend was taken to a concentration camp a few days ago and that she 's only eaten bread for the last 2 days . 
  i wish i could afford it !, 
  you could add most of the maghreb for french . 
  not sure what `` official '' means but it is [ widely used there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maghreb_french ) . 
  looking at the images that was also my first thought . 
  there 's always a token `` not so white/black '' in french parties posters . 
  true , but it 's about southern europe , not mediterranean europe .
