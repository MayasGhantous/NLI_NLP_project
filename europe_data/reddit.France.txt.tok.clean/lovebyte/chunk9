  * also in 1806 , the father of alexandre dumas became g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and was half black . 
  * being a jazz fan , i read that france is the second homeland of jazz , partly because many us black jazz musicians came to france to be treated as human beings and not as blacks . 
  sure , there are racism problems in france , but in the past , france was pretty much better in this respect than any other country . 
  edit : ~ ~ 1906 ~ ~ 1806, 
  the least likely one : dupont-aignan !, 
  the strip club thing is not surprising . 
  there are very few strip clubs in france . 
  it 's not a common thing at all . 
  agreed . 
  never send images of your dick to young children . 
  you could get into trouble !, 
   but to get this money party need to have as many female candidate as male candidate . 
  this is to encourage more women into politics . 
  recently a political party had a little bit more women than men ( as candidates ) and was denied public money . 
  yes , it 's a completely stupid system !, 
  * 2 of the most famous `` french '' people are in fact polish ( marie curie , chopin ) ; * very catholic * many immigrants came to france a long time ago to work in mines ( especially north east of france ) * they love unconditionally the last few letters of the alphabet * they need to progress before reaching the level of social coolness of the west ( regarding gays , racism , ... ) * they have bisons !, 
  not that much : http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/lab_str-labor-strikes the difference with other countries is that the transports ( air france , sncf ( rails ) , m\u00e9tro , bus , ... ) are often on strike . 
  this impacts everyone including some of the 90m visitors we get each year . 
  a polish guy goes to see the optician . 
  the optician asks him if he can read the first line ( in large characters ) on the board : `` x k z y w ... '' . 
  `` read it ? '', 
  answers the polish man , `` i even know this guy !, 
  the french have the lowest results for the latter question because the question is ambiguous . 
  in france , the president and the parliament are directly elected in the sense that you directly vote for one person . 
  the eu elections are some kind of proportional list thing , so you do not directly vote for one person . 
  i think that that 's the reason for the low result from france . 
  dailymotion is french . 
  that 's the only service i can name that i use and is not american . 
  it 's really sad . 
  sorry man , but a large part of the paris surroundings are very steep hills . 
  it does not make much sense to bike to work everyday for most people in those conditions . 
  so about 60 % of people had a religious upbringing and about 86 % are atheists/agnostics . 
  this is strikingly european . 
  no other part of the world would have such numbers . 
  in the last 2 generations , religion has become relevant to a tiny minority of people ( in the age group of / r/europe ), 
  i think a question about ** behaviour ** will tend to be ambiguous . 
  if you ask a question about homosexual behaviour , i am not too sure what to answer . 
  for instance i would not bring my very young kids to a gay pride because it 's overtly sexual . 
  so i would probably not know what to answer about heterosexual behaviour either . 
  well , there is a language issue too . 
  the people that go to an english speaking site from a non-english speaking country tend to be expatriates . 
  sounds exactly like what i heard in france too . 
  not a specialist , but if the animal is suffering or is highly stressed , several types of chemicals will be produced by the body . 
  you really want to avoid them , not that they are dangerous , but they might alter the taste , colour , ... 
  do n't laugh at others , we have done the [ same ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/christine_boutin#ministre_du_logement_et_de_la_ville ) !, 
  since this is r/europe , the question is : was it unique to france ? 
  in france some elected positions can be accumulated , most obvious one is mayor and mp . 
  does this happen elsewhere ? 
  your estates are our `` breaks '' in french . 
  i think it comes from the english hunting breaks . 
  do not forget other critical factors : * women can work and have kids . 
  nobody is going to think they are bad mothers , like in germany * pre-school ( maternelles in french ) , schools and after school activities keep children late , until their parents can pick them up after work . 
  * completely free mother/child weekly meetings in every town and villages for under 3 year old kids ; complete with doctors , nurses , psychologists , education specialists and so on ... those are just incredible . 
  that 's what i basically told him . 
  son , in 14 years time , you 'll be happy if that still happens . 
  i can believe that . 
  i have a similar experience with my 4 year old son . 
  apparently he 's like an ideal french boy for the japanese . 
  each time we go to paris ( i live just outside ) and we come close to japanese tourists , they stop us and take photos of my son . 
  the weirdest time was when a bunch of japanese schoolgirls in uniform started screaming when they saw him . 
  my son is now scared of japanese . 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  i am pissed off by the french government spying on me . 
  i 'd be even more pissed off if the french government massively spied on non-french people . 
  but , you know what : i can do something about it . 
  i can vote , lobby , etc. . . to have this changed . 
  i can not do anything about a foreign government spying on me . 
  lastly , it is also a matter of scale . 
  the means the french services have to spy on people are ridiculously small relative to what the nsa et al. 
  have got . 
  that 's not completely true . 
  us ** mass ** tourism started in the 80 's and , yes , they were `` doing '' europe in on week . 
  this has changed a lot now and americans are much better tourists than they use to be . 
  the same for japanese . 
  the chinese are just starting and they behave like idiot tourists . 
  this will also change in 10 or so years . 
  i heard an expert recently that said that for every espionage act committed by french services , the uk equivalent did 5 and the us 100 . 
  obviously , everyone in this area knew this . 
  the two big differences are : - if you are not in france , you will most probably not be spied on by the french services , whereas the usa agencies listen to everyone via google , ... - the french services have not yet been proven to spy on the us congress , for instance . 
  fine , but where are the european apple , google , amazon ? 
  let 's play this game , name an international european website !, 
  outside of dailymotion , i can not name one . 
  those people are not relevant what so ever . 
  far left , far right and the greens . 
  only the greens are participating in the government and they are rather small . 
  mayonnaise with one n !, 
  dutch speakers should be indicted for crimes against french language , or even linguistic crime , in the linguistic court of paris . 
  kado ( what are you ? 
  6 year olds ? ), 
  cadeautje ( please , kill me now ! ), 
  horloge ( it means clock , damn it , not watch ) and so many other crimes . 
  it 's at least as bad as yanks thinking that entr\u00e9es means main course !, 
   a 17-year-old girl singing about sucking a `` lollipop '' this is exactly what [ france gall ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pxt_r7jlka ) was singing when she was 17 in france and in 1966 . 
  song by gainsbourg so full of innuendos !, 
  right , you do not understand how some of the french unions , especially in the transport area . 
  they basically strike `` to put pressure on the government '' ( as they say ) . 
  then the government gives in ( well before negotiations even start ) , and they stop striking . 
  it means that they can ask for anything they want and get it . 
  it 's very different to the `` normal '' way unions and managements/governments are suppose to work . 
  it 's a scam .
