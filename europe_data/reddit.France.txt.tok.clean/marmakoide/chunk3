  in france , the us start-up culture is making quite a few people dream . 
  we loose a lot of very good engineers to the silicon valley . 
  those people were trained in france on french tax-payers money , and in the end they do n't really benefit from it : /, 
  almost nothing about the colonies in america , nothing at all about the colonies in the pacific , a few words about the colonies in asia , a little bit about africa and especially algeria , extensive description of the triangular trade . 
  at school , we learned that we had colonies , that it was a lot of exploitation and that the development part was mostly to serve the exploitation first . 
  we got very little details about the day to day reality and how those colonies were obtained . 
  i got those details later , because i was curious . 
  in a comic , * valerian and laureline * , in the album * ambassador of the shadows * , amongst the first pages , there 's a depiction of an alien specy , the marmakas . 
  they are extremely radioactive , but they are also amongst the best psychologist there is . 
  this the only time the marmakas are ever mentioned in that comic . 
  for some reason , i was fascinated by the marmakas . 
  * marmakoide * means * in the shape of a marmakas * , like * cardiod * is a curve in the shape of a hearth . 
  ... do n't judge , i was 18 when i picked that nickname . 
  i stuck to it . 
  i lived in paris for a couple of years . 
  the main thing about a high percentage of immigrants are the food options . 
  literally every cooking style on the planet at most 30 mn away . 
  at the public university , no ceremony , no funny hats , no robes , no speech . 
  you have to pick your diploma in an office . 
  if you want even more hate , you follow with * ho , bien ou bien ? 
  * * ma couille * : my testicle ( yes , you read it right ) * * poteau * : a post * * copain/copine * : literally , the guy/girl you shared bread with, 
  by america , i assume you mean the usa . 
  like * the happy , optimistic attitude . 
  europeans are gloomy next to you ... * an attitude to business which is not zero-sum . 
  dislike * the exceptionalism * the way to look at and deal with different human groups aka * `` races '' * . 
  * the individualism * the manichaean attitude to social issues . 
  * panier de crabes * , which is a bucket of crabs . 
  whenever a crab manages to climb up to get out of the bucket , the other crabs hang on him , making him fall into the bucket . 
  safety check of the siren . 
  back in cold war time , i vaguely remember it was a weekly or monthly thing , but not anymore . 
  my dad says * `` give an hydrogen bomb to both side , and at last they will get peace . '' * . 
  i do n't support any sides , both did and do terrible things to the other . 
  after so much blood and suffering , who started it and for what stopped to be relevant . 
  live together and die together , they are bound to it anyway . 
  using swear words as punctuation is like your * perkele * : it 's a way of thinking , a way of life . 
  apologizing for cursing is not a thing over here . 
  do you apologize for breathing air ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  * putain * , * bordel * , * merde * can be used as replacement for punctuation . 
  * putain * is to start a sentence , * bordel * to finish it , and * merde * as a comma . 
  * speak loudly with a southern accent , and you would pass for a native . 
  the past is always around us . 
  every major city center have buildings , if not most buildings dating back to 3 centuries back , sometime a few places date back to the middle age or even the roman empire . 
  every town have centuries old churches , walls , etc. 
  you ca n't escape it . 
  the trick is to put the reusable bags in strategic locations . 
  i always have some in the car , in the storage room , in my backpack and just above the bike . 
  a phase some teenagers go through . 
  it 's not so much a chance to distance from usa , but a chance to unite on some divisive questions like a common defence . 
  cold relationship with usa is loss for both side . 
  it never happened since 1999 . 
  my town is in the middle of a forest . 
  in 1999 , [ a massive storm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyclone_lothar_and_martin ) knocked all the power lines and [ put out of service the only power plant feeding all the province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_blayais_nuclear_power_plant_flood ) . 
  no power for 2 weeks , the power plant was said to have been quite close to go all fukushima on us ... 
  such powerful winter storms are [ common in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_windstorm ) . 
  power lines have been buried since then , problem solved . 
  yes and no . 
  it 's mandatory by law to pay for a plastic bag , but most people uses sturdy reusable bags that last for a decade without a problem . 
  the reusable bags are far more convenient . 
  they did n't seem to have as much fun in the 70 's and the 80 's . 
  they had really rough 90 's . 
  i guess that made them though , with all the good and the bad that goes with it . 
  sichuan levels of tolerance . 
  i lived several years in asia and i 've highly tolerant guts . 
  people do n't flee western europe , despite way , way , way more deadly things happen there , such as road accidents , electrocutions and cancer . 
  act of terrorism are impressive by design . 
  it 's the ` muricanest advert ever, 
  all my german friends/acquaintance can speak at least a bit of french , and they all have a cute way to pronounce french . 
  brits are just behind in term of cuteness with all the accentuations being all over the places and some of the vowels not quite correct . 
  ha , people say the same about france and french , 
  mainland china , around shanghai and vietnam , both hanoi and hcmc . 
  so i never hated living where i grew up , around bordeaux . 
  i thought it was boring , bland and nothing special . 
  i went living in asia for 6 years , and i had a taste of other places . 
  i eventually came back around . 
  now , with something for comparison , i feel blessed to call bordeaux home . 
  maybe what you need is a long , long road trip :d, 
  space needs good bread and the metric system, 
  what i like with asian languages ( well , mandarin & vietnamese ) , is one word = one syllable , all words invariable , agglutination to build new words ( like `` cold + shelf '' for `` refrigerator '' ) . 
  toki pona has those features . 
  i find the idea childish . 
  * the language is very euro-centric , the people who put it together seems to have not a lot of experience of foreign languages beyond their own bubble . 
  * the language is marginally easier to learn for europeans , but that 's it . 
  it does not borrow anything from asian language , like the invariance of all words and the agglutination mechanisms to form new terms . 
  * language differences emerge because of natural communication delays between humans between two areas . 
  you can create one single language to rule them all , and instantly teach to all human . 
  little by little , local variations will emerge and derivate over time to form separate languages . 
  it 's easy to learn ... for people who are native speakers of an european language . 
  it would be as hard as anything european for an asian language . 
  toki pona is an * universally * easier constructed language to learn . 
  the wife buy some maybe thrice a week . 
  less than a kilo in a month . 
  she comes from pig & chicken eating country . 
  if it 's up to me , it 's no meat at all . 
  it looks very close to fig newtons !, 
  they reminds me those long summer afternoons playing soccer in grass fields and building huts in the forest . 
  private brands of french supermarkets are usually the lowest-tiers of the products they sell . 
  it ranges from passable to disgusting . 
  i do n't understand what is god . 
  so far , i 'm doing fine with my life .
