je confirme * i agree *, 
  also , i think you guys have regulations that do n't make it easy to make good cheese ( for example you have to use pasteurised milk , right ? ), 
  i do n't like to pee and shit at the same place i get clean , so toilets and bathroom are separate . 
  seems more hygienic that way . 
  vegetarian people are rare in my area . 
  ( i do n't think i 've ever met a vegetarian . ), 
  so around here , a restaurant with vegetarian dishes are not common . 
  that 's sad . 
  the british made the harrier jump jet . 
  they ca n't be bad mechanics . 
  i 'm french , i 've been to england and scotland , and i do n't ever remember eating something i did n't like . 
  especially in scotland . 
  i was a bit scared before trying haggis , turns out its very good . 
  also , nigella lawson . 
  while there are kebab restaurants everywhere , i would n't call it our national meal . 
  to lessen uk 's advantage , i say we all switch to american english . 
  i would n't be against . 
  ( sorry , the following links are in french . ), 
  french academy faq about it : http://www.academie-francaise.fr/la-langue-francaise/questions-de-langue#56_strong-em-nombre-de-mots-de-la-langue-franaise-em-strong also , a useful thread about it : http://www.languefrancaise.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1762, 
  i do n't think we joke that much anymore about the belgians . 
  it used to be a thing in the past . 
  i was under the impression that they 're the only government to tell the banks to go screw themselves during the last crisis , which i find positive ; but in reality i 'm probably very uninformed . 
  it 's supposed to be easier , indeed . 
  i ca n't think of a government that i like right now . 
  except maybe iceland 's . 
  the thing is , now as an adult , i can see how spanish would be more useful , for example when travelling , knowing both english and spanish is useful in a lot of countries . 
  but when i was younger , i had lots of free tv channels in german that i could n't understand . 
  also , many groups on the computer scene were from germany , so at some point i wished i knew german . 
  to answer your question , i do n't know , but i like to think i would . 
  probably . 
  i 'm not bad in english , i have to confirm a booking by phone , in scotland . 
  that makes me nervous . 
  from what i remember of highschool , there 's a lot of shyness about trying to speak in a foreign language in front of your classmates ... who poke fun at you . 
  for most people that shyness carries on to adult life , i guess . 
  eh , i do like germans , even though i do n't speak the language . 
  i wish i took german instead of spanish in highschool , since i do n't remember any spanish beyond a few words . 
   * maybe someone can clarify who this was an idiot, 
  i thought bugatti was italian . 
  they 'll just work harder to not get caught . 
  that 's surprising !, 
  who would have guessed !, 
  maybe uk is the less hypocrite here . 
  the other countries cry aloud while probably trying to get in on the spying . 
  sorry that you had a bad experience . 
  if i remember my driving lessons , you stop your signal if you change lane on roads with multiple lanes , but you 're supposed to keep your signal on if you pass a car on 1-lane roads ( so that you drive for a moment on the side of the road that goes in the opposite direction ), 
  your post is overly dismissive of the role of the french in ww2 , ( edit : which i admit is not glorious ) so when you 've mentionned the polish resistance , so i thought it might be useful to have some information about the french one . 
  comparing the french 's defence vs poland 's would require to compare the force of the attack , which i ca n't because i do n't know history well enough . 
  comparing the number of agressor do n't mean much , imho , better compare troop numbers , planes , tanks , etc. 
  i think you overestimate the military might of france pre-ww2 , clearly the french overestimated it . 
  the french surrendered because they had inept leadership and took a beating so big there was no point in continuing the same way .

  someone already said it : yes we do !, 
  judging by `` sadam vaincra '' i think it 's probably young immigrants, 
  i did n't care he was kidding , after the 2nd line i did n't like it . 
  but then , humor by insulting people is not my kind of humour . 
  in france there was this type of joke about stupid belgian people . 
  now it 's about blondes . 
  it 's just stereotypical and unfair , something like the surrender jokes the americans have about us . 
  but we never really thought of you as idiots !, 
  i used to dislike spain because of the whole bull killing thing . 
  i 've grown up since . 
  that 's quite accurate , except that i do n't feel that way about england . 
  i might be a minority though . 
  i have a great deal of admiration for britain , and love the english language . 
  and i also like garlic :-p, 
  i think it 's cool, 
  it 's been a long time i heard a joke about the belgians . 
  i 'm not sure it 's still as much a thing as it used to be . 
  it 's a rafale, 
  the first example is also weird to pronouce , because the * liaison * is pronounced like a * t * : [ g\u0281\u0251\u0303t \u203f \u0254m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liaison_ ( french \\ ) ), 
  i too do n't understand why he would call it * worst offender * then proceed to describe how logical english is , in a positive way . 
  my problem with that line of thinking is : if we need a creator for `` this creation '' , when what created the creator ? 
  what created god ? 
  if the answer is that god has always existed , etc ; then why would n't the same reasoning apply to `` this creation '' . 
  edit : i just read that i 'm 19 hours late , / u/perseus0807 wrote the exact same thing . 
  you are probably right , i do n't know history that well . 
  about waterloo , to napoleon . 
  i only visited london , brighton and scotland . 
  scotland is stunning , and i liked london and brighton a lot . 
  you 're right that 's it 's not illegal to go and come back from syria !, 
  but i do n't know , he said djihadists so one could imagine he talks about those , among the french citizens that come back from syria , that are proven or convicted to be djihadists ? 
  that 's not clear from the source . 
  maybe that 's not clear to him either . 
  but it seems he did n't say `` suspected djihadists '' . 
  benefit of the doubt ? 
  that is n't exactly what he said . 
  he talked about 250 djihadis that came back from syria , not about all suspected djihadists http://www.franceinfo.fr/fil-info/article/dupont-aignan-veut-l-arrestation-preventive-des-250-djihadistes-de-retour-de-syrie-et-les-envoyer-774695, 
  a few points : * that map does n't show where the frontier is . 
  * the `` rocky peak '' is actually under the ice , it does n't look like a peak on the outside ; it 's not relevant for the frontier . 
  * the actual , icy peak ( 4810m ) is either shown on the frontier ( http://www.opencyclemap.org/ ) or inside france ( google maps , https://www.google.it/maps/@45.829603,6.8723339,14.75z ) * i 'm trying to find an online version of the map istituto geografico centrale ( i.g.c ) - n \u00b0 107 - monte bianco - courmayeur - la thuile to see where the frontier is on official italian maps . 
  french maps put the icy peak inside france . 
  * here 's an article about the dispute between france and italy : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mont-blanc-controversy-french-suffer-a-fit-of-pique-as-italys-prime-minister-reclaims-europes-10351349.html, 
  i provided many links that say you 're wrong . 
  i 'd admit i 'm wrong if you 'd provide a credible source for your claim . 
  edit : so many typos :(, 
  if by `` in italy '' you mean exclusively in italy , you 're wrong . 
  it 's exactly on the frontier , though french maps claim it 's entirely within france . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mont_blanc#ownership_of_the_summit , https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/monte_bianco#le_disparit.c3.a0_cartografiche and https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/histoire_de_la_fronti%c3%a8re_sur_le_mont_blanc french map http://tab.geoportail.fr/?c=6.861257076263653,45.83087573607944&amp;z=15&amp;l0=orthoimagery.orthophotos:wmts ( 1 ) & l1 = geographicalgridsystems.maps.scan-express . standard : wmts ( 1 ) & permalink = yes, 
    ` ey now , iu guis ca n't complain tat we do n't now ow to speak english , and at za same time camplain tat we start speaking english wen you try your bad french on us . 
  are you a spy ?
