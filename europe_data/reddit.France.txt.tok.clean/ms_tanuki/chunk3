  what can be expensive is the side cost , like the room etc. 
  but this is usually taken care of by a side insurance . 
  people who do n't have revenue have to be affiliated to another state run agency that will cover 100 % of their expense . 
  is it worth it ? 
  yes . 
  you do n't have to worry . 
  you may argue that it should be your freedom to choose to pay or not for an insurance , but i think it is one of the few things that can bind people as a nation , something that is like a duty toward your fellow citizens : everybody shares a percentage of their revenue to put it in a common pot , so we mutualize the risks for individuals . 
  i would love to have an american salary , they 're usually much bigger than ours , but we do n't have to give money to companies whose goal is to make profit , and it 's not about getting `` your money back '' either , it is for the common good . 
  plus there is no entry cost or premium . 
  even if you 're more likely to be sick you wo n't pay more , and absolutely no medical condition can be ruled out of the scheme ( under some condition , plastic surgery can be elligible ) . 
  plus it does n't feel like a tax , it feels more like an insurance or savings , something you will eventually rely on to survive . 
  la reine margot . 
  borderline character played isabelle adjani at the peak of her carrer and beauty , casual dirty sex in dirty streets , prostetant being slaughtered in their houses , totally insane kings and manipulative queen mother . 
  a kind of historical game of thrones in french . 
  ** france is liberal toward sex and alternative lifestyles ** ( massive demos against gay marriage ; less and less topless women on the beach , nobody wearing `` excentric '' clothes compared with london or japan , you have to fit in the mold ) ** french food in french restaurant is good ** . 
  ( personal opinion here but i never had a good bourguignon or pot-au-feu in an average priced restaurant ( never tried in high-end ones ) ; what in served in tourist area in paris can be absolutely disgusting ) ** always on strike ** ( less and less strikes since the end of the 2000s ; they can still get a bit violent though , like last year taxi drivers ' strike ), 
  what if the common denominator we all share as europeans was not the `` big country '' ideal ? 
  what i read in this post is how although there are common values shared by most of europeans they 're not specific enough to bind people together , and that although we tend to culturally americanize we are still too diverse to make up a nation . 
  is n't this `` diversity '' the binding factor , what we share ? 
  in every european country people are very aware of their specificities , most are absolutely not ready to have multiple languages levels ( federal , national and regional ) , they are proud and love their local food and festivals . 
  so what if the binding `` cement '' was the shared consciousness that many european have about their unique cultural heritage instead of an other or some big abstract concept ? 
  the trend so far has been toward intense globalisation and perpetuation of big geographical blocks . 
  however , it may not be sustainable in the long term to keep china as the `` world factory '' , the western world `` the world 's consumers '' and africa just a place to get commodities and raw materials . 
  energy availability/cost and climate change could make this model very weak . 
  however i see more and more initiative to promote short-circuit production , `` local '' currencies that can only be used in a specific area , things that rely on people geographical and cultural proximity to function and are not as dependant to externalities as the current economy . 
  at first it looks like a leftist hippy dream , but there are some project that already work and are successful and by no mean this could totally replace a more standard way of doing things , but i think that that kind of direction could help build something like a european identity , because europeans are as a whole good at being local and lcan appreciate other european people culture 's as something specific . 
  europe could become an alternative to the current idea of globalisation by emphasizing its internal differences , maybe ( you never know ) get ahead in a post-oil world , and eventually get a sense of shared objective . 
  i think europe nowadays does n't work because it is remote and disconnected to its people . 
  i think before you can move forward in political integration you must take it from the hands of bureaucrats in brussels and frankfurt and put it back to the people , emphasize their local specifities to make them feel a part of something bigger ; instead of uniformizing products across borders countries should be encouraged to distinguish more , eventually being very diverse is the common ground we all share and that i think many europeans would like to defend . 
  gender stereotypes assume that men are stronger ( on every level than women ) , so some people say it does n't even exist ( most likely female ) , others will blame the guy for not being `` man '' enough ( most likely men ) . 
  i think it is not a by-product of feminism but a by-product of gender stereotyping . 
  in france we have a similar law . 
  `` no hiding the face in publics spaces '' . 
  what strikes me the most is how the niqabs thing is a kind of trend . 
  there have been muslim women for decades in france , most of them coming from area ( north africa ) with very different interpretation of islam than in the arabic peninsula . 
  covering the hair was seen as optional , and many women did not . 
  nowadays , women who have absolutely no cultural connections to middle east islam are dressing in a way that would scare their own mothers . 
  this thing is alien to their own roots . 
  an iman in france said that there is no prescription for particular piece of clothing in the coran , but a request of modesty . 
  what modesty is there when you dress in a way that makes you stand out from other people , even among people from the same religion ? 
  is n't it a form of vanity ? 
  it seems they say `` look at me i am purer than you all '' . 
  burkas and niqabs are also designed to protect the face from harsh desert conditions like wind and sand . 
  how does this relate to the weather in europe ? 
  it is extremely unsettling to walk by someone whose face is completely covered . 
  it is fordidden to walk the streets naked for the same reason . 
  some people who live in rain forests are completely naked . 
  would we accept them to walk the street naked if they came here , or if it was because of their religion ? 
  we would n't because it infringes our own culture . 
  freedom has boundaries by definition . 
  we are free to eat whatever we want . 
  in some countries it is culturally ok to eat cats , dogs or guinea pigs . 
  would you be ok to have cat and dog breeding and slaughtering facilities in europe to accomodate people whose culture allows to eat them ? 
  no wonder we do n't seem very welcoming sometimes ... 
  english are like brothers to the french : like brothers , we love to diss each other , call each other names and blame each other for `` who started it '' , but when times get dark our connection is strong and sincere . 
  i really hope that soon we will be able to call each other names again !, 
   decadence exactly what they say . 
  basically you 're saying that the people dead were guilty of being careless ? 
  they 're dead because they were having a drink and enjoying a gig ? 
  what do you propose then ? 
  draft ? 
  free access to guns ? 
  what i learned on friday , as i was staying inside a bar with friends because we were too scared to walk home , is that life is short . 
  if we change our way of life and turn against each other , we give them exactly what they want . 
  well , they 've always been talked about in france , although they had some financial issue . 
  i was really surprised by the reactions to the crude humour , which is very french in essence . 
  it is not always funny but i like this one. , it is a nice tribute to the dead . 
  `` annoy '' seems quite weak to me . 
  or something loke `` they 've got weapon but they can piss off , we 've got champagne '' . 
   nihilistic hedonism  hasten their doom you speak like a religious terrorist yourself . 
  that 's exactly what they 'd want us to do . 
  french people have thrown orgies , drunk and eaten too much and indulge in sleazy sex for centuries . 
  we are not going to change that because of few bearded short-dicked frustrated men , even though it will do nothing to prevent further tragedy , and that 's exactly what i think this cartoon is saying . 
  as a parisian i like it , i feel this is more a tribute to the dead than disrespect , and a tribute to our way of living . 
  btw today i learned a new phrase : [ gallows humor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gallows_humor ) i think it is close to the type of humor we have here . 
  well personaly i 'm happy they focused on the people who matter , the victims . 
  i do n't give a fuck about the other rats , putting them on the cover of a magazine is way too much publicity for them . 
  do n't worry there will be plenty of insults at the terrorists in the inside pages . 
  as often , such cartoons have multiple interpretations , which often just mirror one 's personal point of view . 
  yes but do you say `` let 's shit on them '' everyday in english ? 
  the meaning is `` fuck them '' with a `` nevermind '' twist . 
  well i guess . 
  the country with which it will mostly happen is algeria . 
  an algerian co-worker told me they do n't really know what happens to people convicted of terrorrism over there , she said they kind of `` disappear '' ... 
  yes . 
  there is a french proverb that says `` better to laugh about it than to cry '' ( mieux vaut en rire qu'en pleurer ) . 
  maybe there is the same in english ? 
  it is there . 
  `` on les emmerde '', 
  this is the most common way of saying `` fuck you '' in a `` i do n't care what you do/say to me '' emmerder = em - ( in , on ) + merd - ( shit ) + er ( verb ending ) : to cover with or to immerse in shit . 
  can also mean `` to annoy '' as in `` ces putains de connards m 'em merdent '' : those fucking assholes are pissing me off '' or `` to be bored '' `` qu'est que j emmerde '' = i 'm fucking bored . 
  i think it is two things , it is a bit bittersweet 1 . 
  our freedom and lifestyle are not going to protect us against bullets ; saying we will resist through partying an going out is a bit derisory ; 2 . 
  people are not going to stop partying and enjoying life anyway . 
  only if they have a double nationality . 
  `` they 've got weapons , fuck them , we 've got champagne '', 
  i like that . 
  i am a cold regina from now on . 
  it was in the glorious land where normal people call things their normal name . 
  exactly .
