'' * very little gravitas indeed * '', 
   well its when the french have a 35 hour working week on paper only . 
  personally i do n't know anybody working only 35 hours a week . 
  the norm around me is 39 hours , with quite a few people working extra time up to 43 hours . 
  43 being the legal maximum . 
   london is france 's sixth largest city . 
  no it 's not . 
  according to the 2011 census , there is ~ 86000 french passport holder in london and ~ 66000 people born in france . 
  ( and there is a lot of dual citizens among them ) http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs212ew/view/2013265927?cols=measures http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs203ew/view/2013265927?cols=measures so more around the 70th rank in term of largest french city . 
   i don \u00b4 t see radical christians or buddhist blowing themselves up in s-e asia , southern thailand , myanmar , and maybe elsewhere there is buddhist terrorism against muslim / animists minorities . 
  i do n't know about blowing oneself up , but they sure kill them . 
  it is not only airbus , there is also dassault , snecma , atr , safran , thales alenia space ... 
  so even taking into account the european span of airbus , i would n't be surprised if the top french export was aircraft and space nonetheless, 
  yes please , or a way to filter them out . 
  instead of a new sub , implementing flairs for filtering would be nice . 
  either like how it 's done on / r/france for instance ( in the sidebar ) , where you can choose a theme : tech , news , culture , help , askfrance ... or on / r/worldnews where you can filter out some topics : no ukraine , no israel , no ebola ... or a combination of both : pickup a theme , filter out some others . 
  if the mods feel up to do something like it i think it would be useful , i sure would like it . 
   but it 's still your former colonies , ergo your mess . 
  after how many years the former colonialist is no longer held responsible for `` the mess '' happening in the former colony ? 
  should u.k. still be held accountable for what 's happening in canada , in the u.s.a , in kenya ... ? 
  belgium in congo , germany in namibia , danemark in virgin island and so on ... ? 
   why should they ? 
  if i remember , both in mali and centrafrique , many europeans nations were saying that something has to be done , we could n't let mali become a jihadistan and the genocide in rca must be stopped . 
  it does n't mean that they should participate either on the ground or financially but at least it would be consistent with their stance . 
   numerous `` partners '' have given tons of logistical support to france the spending for operation serval to which you 're referring to amount to [ 646 millions euros for 2013 ] ( http://www.bfmtv.com/economie/1-25-milliard-deuros-depenses-militaires-exterieures-2013-640996.html ) only * { link in french } * . 
  so yes , france had numerous `` partners '' and that 's good , but i think we bore most of the cost . 
  quotes from the article :  `` the patient 's symptoms suggest that ebola is very unlikely but as a precaution this is one of the tests being undertaken . 
   `` the patient was not symptomatic on the plane and therefore there is no risk of ebola being passed on to either flight crew or other passengers . 
  sorry but you 're wrong . 
  there is very , very little chance that lagarde take the ump candidacy for the next presidential election . 
  she has been basically outside of the french political life for the last years , she does n't have the right people standing behind her , and she 's not very popular with the french audience . 
  i do n't even think pollsters put her name on the list of the candidates . 
  it 's specially true for presidential election in france . 
  one year prior to the date of the last election , sarkozy , the incumbent president , was at his lowest in the poll . 
  then the campaign started : electoral gathering , tv shows etc. 
  the end result was something like 49 % / 51 % . 
  even the pollsters says that so far ahead of the actual election , it 's basically worthless . 
  i remember some of them from the biggest polling agencies saying so on tv . 
  poll done via internet , 3 years prior to the election date : sensationalist pointless bullshit . 
   but at least i try i 'm french but my spoken english is truly awful when i try to speak it with what i imagine ( and hear in my head ) is a proper accent . 
  nobody understand me , and i mean nobody understand nothing . 
  i tried speaking louder to no avail ... 
  i do n't even try now to speak with the right pronunciation and concentrate on what i am saying . 
  i speak with the thickest french accent , you can tell from miles away where i 'm from , but they understand . 
  plus , some people find it kind of cute . 
   rindermann used available iq measurements in various countries i do n't know what is the sample but iq tests are almost unknown of in france . 
  that 's true that we are not as obsessed with england . 
  i mean we barely noticed and commented about them being eliminated in the world cup ... and op seems to spend a lot of his time thinking about us , 4 out of his last 10 submissions are about how much france sucks . 
  about varane and r\u00e9my :  `` both of whom have fathers who were born in martinique '' . 
  first , martinique is france , not another country , and those players were born in france . 
  this is true for all , or almost all of the other players too , even if their father or both parents were born abroad . 
  anyway , i ca n't understand how parents being born foreigner is enough to consider someone immigrant , the kids were born here . 
  edit : the title of the article is even worst : * `` here 's what world cup teams would look like if immigrants were n't allowed to play '' *, 
  maybe , but a poll suggest that the people who stayed at home would have voted about the same way that the one who did go to vote . 
  http://imgur.com/f0jbzxy so unfortunately it is not as simple as to say it 's because of the abstention . 
  source in french here : http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/05/26/peut-on-relativiser-le-score-du-fn_4426060_4355770.html, 
  it is not thought as a denunciation line but more as a help line for the families knowing their kids are on their way or about to go to syria . 
  that 's right . 
  a guy posted on / r/france , not so long ago , because he was worried about his sister . 
  iirc she was in turkey on her way to syria ( with her boyfriend/husband i think ) and the family was at their wits ' ends , not knowing what to do , whom to contact , how to bring her back . 
  i think this kind of hotline would have been welcome at the time . 
  you really seems committed : http://www.reddit.com/user/darkmatter944/submitted/, 
   i looked this up . 
  according to an official french government website there are 751 such areas in france ; http://sig.ville.gouv.fr/atlas/zus/[1]   what . 
  the . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sensitive_urban_zone this is just urban area where it 's been decided to implement special city policies . 
  nothing to see here . 
  it 's not like it does n't exist anywhere else . 
   sorry , a what ? 
  it 's the french for * appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e * , which translate as `` controlled designation of origin '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appellation_d%27origine_contr%c3%b4l%c3%a9e it 's serious business here . 
  european dependence to russian gas is around 30 % . 
  and the mild winter left the stocks high in western europe . 
  gazprom export to europe is about 30 % of it 's total gas sales and half of russia 's total budget revenue comes from oil and gas , so it would hurt both way . 
  you forgot to include the u.k. in your title : [ uk seeking to ensure russia sanctions do not harm city of london government document photographed outside no 10 states that ` london 's financial centre ' should not be closed to russians ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/03/uk-seeks-russia-harm-city-london-document ), 
   according to new figures from the european union suggesting ... 
  according to the french economy minister , it wo n't :  france has a public finance trajectory that it presented to the european commission and it is sticking to it . 
  guess which one made the title as a fait accompli ? 
  the same law has been voted in france . 
  to buy sexual services is now penalized . 
  the prostitute ca n't be charged for solicitation , and those responsible for organising prostitution , the pimps , are of course still prosecuted . 
  as said , it is not about feminism , it is about protecting those forced into prostitution . 
  i believe the law is written in a gender-neutral way . 
  actually that 's what i found interesting in this article . 
  the author family is obviously well educated and quite wealthy , they seem to have the means and know-how to get first rate treatment . 
  memorial sloan kettering cancer center seems to be one of the best hospital in this field in the usa . 
  and this is the one she compares to a public hospital in france where everyone else would receive the same cares . 
  what she describes , the home visit by a nurse , the doctor taking the time to talk and explain , the no billing hassle , is very much what my family experienced when my father had cancer . 
  and it was in a medium sized public hospital , for a family like any other . 
  you wo n't become biased because the teacher is , you 'll develop a bias if you lack critical thinking . 
  question what you learn , object if you disagree , find out other opinions if what he teaches does n't make sense or seems fishy to you . 
  you wo n't necessarily finish the course holding the same views as the teacher , but you 'll sure learn something and know the topic better . 
  at least , you know the teacher is competent : https://www.coursera.org/instructor/albertoalemanno as for hec , it 's the top notch business school in france . 
  * thanks op , i enrolled . 
   that could quite possibly lead to the uk leaving the eu . 
  please , stop promising , just do it . 
  right , let 's sell the drugs the police seize , you know to keep the prices low on the street . 
  thanks for this link . 
  interestingly , this wikipedia page does n't exist in french . 
  they are not saying there is no differences between the sexes .
