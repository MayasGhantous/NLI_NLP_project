  they are saying : it 's not because you are of feminine gender that you ca n't be an astronaut . 
  or earn the same salary as a man for the same job . 
  it 's not about `` gender theory '' * per se * , because it is not going to be taught in school . 
  it is about right-wing crazy , thinking that transsexual and homosexual are going to teach 3-4 years old kids how to masturbates . 
  a lot of fud and spread rumours against the `` evil socialists '' corrupting our children by the same who were in the streets against the gay marriage . 
   to consistently define a picture that 's looking ominous . 
  are you , by any chance , referring to the wsj ( or the economist ) extracting one number out of an article with much more stunning numbers to make a nice title about france 's collapse ? 
  i do n't have much knowledge in economy but how an indicator with such huge variation from one year to the next is relevant ? 
  +392 % in germany , -75 % in australia , -98 % in switzerland ... 
  should n't it be measured on greater period of time to means something ? 
  ^ edit : spelling, 
  thanks . 
  yes , no doubt there is some radical islamist that could be labelled as terrorists among them , but i think there is also some one could compares with the fighters in the international brigades during the spanish civil war . 
  but i do n't know , back then , the guys coming back from fighting franco might very well have been labelled as terrorists too . 
  no , i meant , the french media would n't give him much flake and would n't be much interested about it . 
  the british one , well , yes i guess it would drive them into a frenzy, 
   is criticizing religion okay ? 
  yes , it is . 
  you can say that in france , it 's ok , do n't worry . 
  but you could n't say that jews should be gassed because they are part of an international conspiracy ... blah ... blah ... or all muslims should be deported because they are invading our country to rape our daughters ... blah ... blah ... you could n't say that without consequences . 
  chinese communities would pretty well fit your description . 
  as would european communities in asian , african , or middle-eastern countries . 
  yeah , that 's true , we are always comparing france with germany . 
  and most often than not , at our disadvantage . 
  but to whom germany compares itself to ? 
  french original article here : http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/01/15/97001-20140115filwww00567-le-liechtenstein-ferme-sa-seule-maternite.php, 
  i do n't know but the british seems kind of obsessed with france . 
  i was looking for something on british papers and i was astonished at the number of articles regarding french current affairs ... https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=france&amp;oq=france&amp;gs_l=news-cc.3...672.851.0.1134.6.2.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0...1ac.1.&amp;sei=m7_wupqydole7absg4coda&amp;gbv=2 ok , i know there is currently some hot topics , but british papers talks about hollande affair 's as much , if not more , than the french ones . 
  i mean , if cameron would happen to have a fuck buddy , there sure would be a couple of articles but nothing like that : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/ and what about always comparing the two countries or making this kind of articles : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10570527/ten-reasons-why-britain-is-better-than-france.html in france , as far as i know , most media did n't even report what seems to be for the british a major diplomatic row between the two countries . 
   try to find a white french under 90 who 's named c\u00e9lestin ( protip : you ca n't ) re-read my comment . 
  you obviously did n't . 
  my little cousin is named c\u00e9lestin . 
  i did n't say how old he is but obviously younger than 90 . 
  he 's 4 years old . 
  or maybe because of his name you assumed he was n't white ? 
  from africa , funny name seriously ? 
  they are french name , some of them a bit out of fashion , but my great grand father was named d\u00e9sir\u00e9 and my little cousin name is c\u00e9lestin , both born and raised in normandy . 
   honestly i 've yet to read/hear anything offensive from him so far & # 8203 ; here are two quotes from dieudon\u00e9 . 
  the second one is from his show and i think its the one who started the last fuss . 
  i transcribe them from memory so they are not a hundred percent accurate and my translation is far from optimal , but i believe they convey well enough the content of his speech . 
  but you can find the show on youtube , as a bonus , you 'll have the sickening laugh of the audience after `` packs its suitcase '' and `` gas chambers '' . 
  & # 8203 ;  i do n't want to choose between the jews and the nazi . 
  i was n't born , i do n't know who started it . 
  i do n't know who stole from whom . 
  but ... you know ... 
  i have an idea about it . 
  & # 8203 ;  patrick cohen [ a famous french radio journalist ] , well , if the tide turns , i 'm not sure he will have time to pack its suitcase , you know , when i listen to patrick cohen , well , i tell myself , the gas chamber ... you know ... too bad ... 
  neither him nor a french government representative said why he is not going . 
  everybody is just assuming it is a kind of `` boycott '' because of the gay/human right situation in russia , but so far , nobody knows . 
  sarkozy did n't went to vancouver olympics in 2010 , i do n't remember anybody giving a shit . 
  did canadian felt insulted ? 
  did anybody saw this as a political statement ? 
  according to these data from eurostat [ 2012 ] , there is more british citizen in france than french citizen in england . 
  : http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jan/26/europe-population-who-lives-where there is more german than french too , i 'm not sure one can conclude from this that germany 's economy is failing . 
  for france , it would be soissons , according to wikipedia : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/capitale_de_la_france, 
   still has no new government is there a deadline to find a majority ? 
  and meanwhile , what 's happening , is the previous coalition continue running the country as before the election or is the bundestag is `` on hold '' ? 
  there was a fight . 
  someone died in the fight . 
  the people involved in the fight face justice . 
  the judge does n't care whether they are anti-fa or skinhead . 
  the autopsy said that the death was because of the blows not the fall . 
  one of them acknowledge being responsible for some of the blows . 
  the judge is trying to determine if another one had struck the guy who died . 
  i guess that 's the deal here . 
  at least that what i gathered from the french papers . 
  here are two sources in french : http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/09/10/affaire-meric-nouvelle-mise-en-examen-pour-un-skinhead_930710 http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2013/09/10/97001-20130910filwww00509-affaire-meric-2eme-mise-en-examen.php, 
  pm me your address and you 'll get one from france , 
  two of your links are to the same blog which might be serious , i honestly do n't know it , but i ca n't help but notice that it itself link to a conspirationist 9/11 website in its sidebar . 
  you might have an error in your link to the ap website because it send me to this page : http://hosted.ap.org/specials/bluepage.html which i believe is basically a `` not found page '' . 
   i have n't looked at the french inteligence report , but i imagine it 's much the same . 
  here is a 5 pages summary in english : http://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/219128/2437985/file/national%20executive%20summary%20of%20declassified%20intelligence.pdf from this page : http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/programme-chimique-syrien-et-attaque-du-21-aout-2013, 
  i put a negative connotation because in my book sarkozy is an asshole . 
   you should then agree with me that it is positive that you voluntarily learn a language . 
  i already try to speak two foreign languages and i am going to try learning a third one . 
  i did n't wait for you to think that learning a language was positive . 
  and keep explaining to me what i actually think , coming from someone who seems to broadly categorize all french speakers as arrogant , it is quite rich . 
  i guess he was too busy doing political stuff , but do n't worry , after his defeat , he learned it to be able to make money on the international conferences tour . 
  if you refer to sarkozy , he did n't refuse to speak english , he did n't know how to speak english . 
  a famous quote from sarkozy receiving hilary clinton is : `` the time is nice today '' instead of `` the weather is nice '' . 
  in french it is the same word , * temps * , for time and weather . 
  o.k but to forbid public servants to answer in another language that they do master is just lame . 
  it 's like if an english citizen in france were lucky enough to face a public servant able to speak proper english and denied to do so because the law forbid him to speak another language and be actually helpful . 
  here it is : http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/reports-of-brussels-big-brother-bid-to-impose-speed-controls-are-inaccurate-beyond-the-limit-2/ it is already debunked, 
  basically , no . 
  the `` foul me once , foul me twice '' bullshit is really tiresome and dumb . 
  i mean , sorry but , people who believe in it and make their decisions on this kind of logic must be just dumb . 
  they are not the `` same guys . '', 
  bush and powell are not kerry and obama . 
  like cameron is not churchill neither holland is chirac or de gaulle or merkel is `` literally '' hitler . 
  they have occupied the same posts , and because one lied , we ca n't trust their successors any more , ever ? 
  so why even vote if you have already decided you are not going to trust them , because they must be liars ? 
  why even bother with democracy ? 
  there is , i am sure , plenty of good reasons and arguments to be against a western intervention in syria , you should work on them , because the `` foul me once , foul me twice '' gimmick is not one of them . 
  * and , as a side note because i do n't expect to convince you , i do n't think french intelligence services said there was wmd in irak , i might be wrong but i believe they said quite the opposite at the time . 
   whose intelligence services ? 
  u.s. and french intelligence services did . 
  maybe u.k too , i do n't know . 
  french are not eager to go , but the french official position is something like this : use of chemical weapons against civilians is a big no-no . 
  so if there is definitive proofs that assad has used chemical weapons against his people , we ca n't let it pass , we must send the signal , to assad and others , that it wo n't go unpunished .
