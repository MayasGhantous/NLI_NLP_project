  basically this is the french position on the matter , it 's about dissuasion on the use of chemical weapons and to send a political signal . 
  it 's not really a military matter * per se * it is not about pushing assad out of power . 
  so i think they are waiting for official u.n. proof of the use of chemicals , not a `` colin powell '' kind of proof , and they are handpicking the targets of potential strikes to send the right message and making clear in the meantime they are not trying to overthrow the regime . 
  my 2 cents . 
  hey , i understood this one . 
  the funny thing is i do n't speak portuguese , just french and a bit of spanish, 
  even more confusing is seeing this news more commented and upvoted in / r/europe than in / r/space ... 
  i agree with you , but many of the webcams available on the link i gave earlier are not in public location . 
  quite a few of them are private feeds : inside shops , inside offices , inside houses , toddler nanycams ... etc and i believe many supposedly private feeds can be accessed with a bit of technical knowledge/hacking, 
  yeah , but if someone like me with no technical knowledge can access it , i can only imagine what can do the `` people in power '' ... 
  you might be right , but it is so easy to gain access to those `` private '' cameras ... http://livesecuritycams.com/, 
  does considering oneself basque correlate with being pro-independence ? 
  genuine question , i 'm sure a lot welsh , alsatian , corsican or whatever , have a very strong cultural identity but would n't be willing to become independent . 
  i guess you 're right . 
  i did n't think about it this way . 
  but maybe it would n't be unreasonable to think there is a correlation between population and job opportunities : more people also means more companies , more shops , more services needed , more jobs available ? 
  i 'm surprised to see so few europeans in england and germany , below 4 % . 
  compare to other countries like spain , iceland , norway or ireland , all above 5 % . 
  i thought england , with the advantage of the language , the city being the financial capital of europe , the hype about how great it is for new companies and the like ... and germany as the continental powerhouse and industrial leader would have drawn a much bigger crowd . 
  it is usually how the media depict them in france at least ; berlin being invaded par poor spaniard and other southern europeans and london being the sixth most populated french city and drawing all the new businessmen in this liberal paradise ... 
  wtf is this link ?

  in 2001 the price was averaging 4.00 ff ~ 0.61 euro . 
  today the average price is 0.88 euro http://www.finances.gouv.fr/fonds_documentaire/euro2002/guidespub/grandpublic/page4.htm http://news.fr.msn.com/m6-actualite/france/conso-les-francais-marchent-a-la-baguette?page=4, 
  well , i said `` most of it '' . 
  anyway i do n't remember such a widespread feeling about the french before the irak war ( 2003 ) more specifically . 
  what is worst is that most of it came after france decided not to follow the u.s and the u.k. in the irak war not because of the surrendering to germany in wwii . 
  before this time , i do n't think this belief was held , even in anglophone circles . 
  it 's a negative pr campaign more than anything else , but a successful one and for a lot of people we are now the `` cheese-eating surrender monkeys '', 
  yes , i thought about her too , but i guess the `` epic '' factor made me go father back in time and the example given by op was closer . 
  but yeah , i believe she fit the bill . 
  for france , it would be [ vercingetorix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vercingetorix ) , he united the gauls and leads them in the fight against the romans and caesar . 
  i think he 's talking about the size reflecting the value : the smaller the value , the smaller the size . 
  if i remember correctly , your 2p coin is bigger than the 5p , which can be quite confusing when your not used to , i.e. 
  as a tourist . 
  talk about editorialized title ... 
  honestly , i think you should travel a bit . 
  i 've been lucky enough to be able to , and when you see what poverty can be , you feel lucky and not that poor . 
  for the record , it was n't a burqa . 
  burqa are almost unknown in france . 
  your submitted history : http://www.reddit.com/user/dominumformidas/submitted/ looks like / r/niggers, 
   delphine batho , minister of ecology , sustainable development and energy ( and member of the green party ) actually she 's not a member of the green party , she 's a socialist and she actually does n't know much about ecology . 
  it 's a wonder why she gets this minister in the first place because her field of competence is mostly security matters . 
  * the autopsy report stated that the death was the consequence of the blows not the fall * i was surprised how little the media talked about the `` nsa scandal '' considering how big it is, 
  i think he 's all right , you can see him get away on the left side [ of the truck ], 
   and what is she charged for ? 
     she said that muslims using the streets to pray because mosques were overflowing was an `` occupation '' of french territory . 
  oh look at this !, 
  oh is n't it terrible ?!, 
  racist !, 
  racist !, 
  she did n't just say that the street prayers were an occupation , she likened the sight of muslims praying in the streets to the nazi occupation of france . 
  and believe it or not , it 's a touchy subject here . 
   were n't their numbers lately suggesting that if the elections would be held again , she 'd win ? 
  no , the numbers did n't suggest that .

  here is an extract on the methodology :   eurostat produces harmonised unemployment rates for indi  vidual eu member states , the euro area and the eu . 
  these unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the international labour organisation ( ilo ) . 
  the  measurement is based on a harmonised source , the european union labour force survey ( lfs ) . 
   based on the ilo definition , euro  stat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who :  - are without work ;  - are available to start work within the next two weeks ;  - and have actively sought employment at so  me time during the previous four weeks . 
   the  unemployment rate  is the number of people unemployed as  a percentage of the labour force . 
  the  labour force  is the  total number of people employed plus unemployed . 
  in this ne  ws release unemployment rates are based on employment and  unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74,

   people of arab descent , or religious muslims , do n't agree with us . 
  they want a religious state in syria . 
  it 's a wide generalization and a bold statement . 
  should i assume that all norwegians people agree with you ? 
  am i wrong if i think she put first the bi-lateral relationship between germany and china even if it 's detrimental to the europe as a whole ? 
  it 's a genuine question , i do n't know enough on the topic of low chinese solar panels and phone gear imported in the european market to make an informed opinion . 
  a few in france : * [ les vieilles charrues ] ( http://www.vieillescharrues.asso.fr/2013/programmation ) * [ eurockeennes ] ( http://www.eurockeennes.fr/index.php/artistes/programme-complet ) * [ hellfest ] ( http://www.hellfest.fr/ ) * [ jazz \u00e0 vienne ] ( http://www.jazzavienne.com/fr/festival ) * [ les chor\u00e9gies d'orange ] ( http://www.choregies.fr/fr/saison_2013-3.html ) * [ jazz in marciac ] ( http://www.jazzinmarciac.com/spectacles/jazz-in-marciac ), 
  this is bullshit . 
  after the 100 % tax the `` bouclier fiscal '' / `` the fiscal shield '' apply , which limit the rate to 50 % . 
  furthermore , we are talking about people with huge assets [ more than 1.5 million euro ] with very little income from wages , salary or stock dividends [ you do n't need a monthly income when you 've got `` savings '' in which to dig ] . 
  so yes , mechanically , the tax on theirs assets will easily be more than their income , because the income are artificially kept low to avoid taxes ... 
  i think it 's a recap of the `` poll '' . 
  or maybe i missed the sarcasm in your comment . 
  or maybe i 'm the one not getting it and he 's quite a traveller ... 
  yes and a few of the `` false friend '' we learn about during english courses , one of the most famous : actual , actually . 
  an interesting read even for those unlikely to produce any eu publications , thanks op . 
  right . 
  plus it would be interesting to know if they 've taken into account the price to dismantle old nuclear power plants . 
  i believe they did n't . 
  because the s\u00e9nat will not just vote the text , but study it and can make ` amendments ' , modifications , which in turn will be studied by the national assembly and might be taken into account, 
  basically , the national assembly [ lower chamber ] is the first step . 
  then it goes to the s\u00e9nat [ upper chamber ] . 
  if the s\u00e9nat confirm , then the law is passed . 
  if the senat denies it , it goes back to the national assembly which will have the last word . 
  in this case , both chambers are on the same line so it 's already sure that the law is going to pass . 
  no , i 'm sorry , i made kind of a general statement . 
  obviously , it 's not all white or black , but overall i would say that france is n't split over this issue . 
  we do like beckham , and most peoples are glad he comes to play here , but we know that it 's mainly a communication and marketing operation for the qatari owners of the club in order to get some love and some money because psg is nothing in asia while beckham is huge over there . 
  qatar , paris st-germain owner , got a lot of heat in france right know . 
  about the fact that they bought and rigged the world cup 2022 , and because they are believed to have sent arms and ammunitions to terrorists in mali , which we are fighting right now . 
  and about the charity donation , nobody say it 's not great , because it is . 
  but the fact that when they announced it during the press conference , they did n't know yet which charity would benefits , let many peoples think it was more likely a last minute move and a pr thing . 
  tl ; dr the france is n't split over , we like beckham 's right foot , and he 's welcome .
