  thanks , i 've missed it . 
  why do you equal `` natural resources '' with `` animal abuse '' , sorry , i do n't get it ? 
  b. arnault shifted his assets to belgium in 2011 , before hollande election . 
  if you 're referring to the 75 % tax , it 's irrelevant because it 's supposed to be applied on income [ salary , wages ... ] not assets . 
  the goal of this belgium foundation he set-up is to evade inheritance taxes . 
  i ca n't find no other sources about it , neither in french nor english . 
  rt and voice of russia have nothing about russia sending troops or even a logistical assistance to mali . 
  it 's odd , because le figaro is usually a reliable newspaper , but apparently it 's the only one having knowledge of such a news . 
  but it 's true that russia stated that they shared position with france at the un security council and support the resolution 2085 . 
   also i think it would be high time to measure the quality of births . 
  is it the middle-class family having 2 kids , or they have 0 and it is the toilet cleaner family having 4 ? 
  are you saying what i think you 're saying ? 
  i 'm honestly not sure , i doubt of my english comprehension skills , i might misinterpret . 
  but if you 're saying that a child born from a lower class worth less than one born from an upper class , man that stink . 
  most french are fed up of those rich whiners . 
  at the beginning many peoples supported depardieu , but that 's no longer true , the gag has been running for too long . 
  most of us tell them , take your money and shut up , and gtfo . 
  will deal with it without you , `` the cemeteries are full of indispensable men . '', 
   it now covers unpopular opinions . 
  sorry but no , your wrong . 
  in france at least . 
  the law is quiet clear . 
  it 's not about opinions , it 's about statements . 
  since 1881 , with addition in 1972 , the law say [ rough translation ] : `` it 's forbidden to provoke discrimination , hate or violence toward a people or a group of peoples because of theirs origins , belonging to an ethnic group , a nation , a race or a specific religion '' . 
  this is the law in france , i do n't see why peoples expressing themselves on twitter should get a free pass on this when you do n't get one if you write it in the papers , say it on tv or anywhere else . 
   criminalizing ideas does n't make them go away yes , right . 
  this is not only a stupid idea , it 's also a logical fallacy : criminalizing acts does n't make them disappears either , so let 's not criminalizing criminal acts . 
  there is a difference between `` opinions '' and `` hate speech '' . 
  inciting peoples to kill gay , or jews or black because they are gay , jews or black , is n't an opinion , it 's a call for murder , and i believe that it should be criminalized . 
  it 's been rejected , more or less , on a `` technicality '' , the law will be rewrited and proposed again , the government just announced it . 
  for those who do n't know what the conseil constitutionel is , it 's not really , like most people think , a truly `` unpolitical '' instance . 
  most of its members are from the right side of the political spectrum , being either former pr\u00e9sidents de la r\u00e9publique : sarkozy , chirac , giscard d'estaing , or having been appointed by them . 
  here is the list of its members : http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/le-conseil-constitutionnel/les-membres-du-conseil/liste-des-membres/liste-des-membres-du-conseil-constitutionnel.319.html, 
  what is worst is that such crap make top of / r/worldnews : http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/15lp4c/french_government_cuts_immigrants_welfare_by_83/ and most of the commenters seems to believe it ... 
  if you referring to this part :  now immigrants who are eu citizens receive an allowance of 2,000 euros per adult and 1,000 euros per child . 
  do n't bother taking eu citizenship , because those numbers are wrong , like most of this article actually . 
  why this blog is even considered a news source ? 
   france 's socialists are denying reality . 
  is that a fact ? 
  from here , france , it 's not so obvious . 
   hate the game , not the player . 
  it 's an easy way out of one 's responsibility . 
  luckily , some of the players , even ones benefiting from the flawed game , try to improve the rules to makes it fairer . 
  some of them being intelligent enough not to let the `` maximizing of profits '' rule impair their moral and ethical beliefs . 
  who is going to check ? 
  and how ? 
  there is no longer passport stamps when you cross the border . 
  you think the fiscal administration has the manpower to check for every french national living abroad if they really spend more than 6 months outside of france ? 
  because he 's not going to live in the belgium countryside , he 's not going to commute from paris twice a day . 
  the pm said : `` we can not fight poverty if those with the most , and sometimes with a lot , do not show solidarity and a bit of generosity . '', 
  that 's sound right to me . 
  the rich guy move 1 kilometre beyond the border for the only reason to evade taxes . 
  to me , that 's sound hypocritical and wrong . 
  i do n't know well the u.s fiscal system , but i believe nationality and fiscal duties are bound . 
  this sound right too . 
  i wish france , and the europeans countries create a unified fiscal system to limit this kind of selfish behaviours . 
  40/45 , eastern countries are all mixed up ... 
  i do n't know if you can get access to this result page on the french national railway site : http://www.voyages-sncf.com/billet-train/resultat?hid=5zp#journey_2 so , here is a picture : http://i.imgur.com/tespgcm.jpg bordeaux - irun / / irun - madrid , one-way , 2nd class , lower price : 94 $ 40 departure : bordeaux : 10h51 arrival : irun : 13h18 departure : irun : 13h47 arrival : madrid : 21h31 next best price are ~ 120 $ and ~ 250 $ edit : if she is under 25 years old , price seems to be around 60 $ go there : http://www.voyages-sncf.com/billet-train/ fill-up the form and you 'll find out, 
  in france for 2015 date | holiday : -- | : ------ | jeudi 1er janvier | jour de l\u2019an ( new year ) lundi 6 avril | lundi de p\u00e2ques ( easter ) vendredi 1er mai | f\u00eate du travail ( labour day ) vendredi 8 mai | victoire 1945 ( victory 1945 ) jeudi 14 mai | ascension ( feast of the ascension ) lundi 25 mai | lundi de pentec\u00f4te ( pentecost ) mardi 14 juillet | f\u00eate nationale ( national day ) samedi 15 ao\u00fbt | assomption ( assumption ) dimanche 1er novembre | toussaint ( all saints ' day ) mercredi 11 novembre | armistice 1918 vendredi 25 d\u00e9cembre | jour de no\u00ebl ( christmas ) official source : http://www.service-public.fr/actualites/007785.html so it seems there is only 11 of them and not 12 as stated in this article . 
  today is off in france , may was a pretty good month this year because all of them where during weekday . 
  johann pachelbel 's canon , especially [ this version by musica antiqua k\u00f6ln ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtzjropbrem ) and then bach of course : cello suite , goldberg variations , brandenburg concertos etc. 
   none of them passed it through a referendum . 
  we 're the first to do so . 
  but some countries just ca n't hold a referendum on such matters . 
  as i understand it , in france for instance , it was not , legally , an option . 
  and in top of what has already been said there is no hurricane nor earthquake risks . 
  the `` infringement cases '' are the blue bars . 
  the red ones are `` late or incorrect transpositions '', 
  they do n't say they 're doing it for moral reasons , my understanding is that they 're saying roughly : * a part of the prostitution activity is already taken into account as accurately as possible , the `` shallow prostitution '' ( not sure about the translation ) : shady massage parlours , bar hostesses / escorts services ... * for the human trafficking sort of prostitution , you obviously ca n't get any accurate numbers plus there is the problem of consent which is the third point * mutual consent : you ca n't consider as commercial a transaction for which there is no mutual consent . 
  they consider that for the sub-saharian / mafiosi managed prostitution rings for example , the prostitutes do n't take part in a mutually agreed activity but are more slave/forced labourers . 
  they had the same reasoning with drug addicts , they were considering it as a medical issue , and because of the addiction , the free will/mutual agreement part to the exchange was n't considered present . 
  they changed theirs stance on the drug issues and will add the numbers in accordance to the eu regulation because the figures are taken into account to calculate the french contribution to the eu budget , but wo n't add it to the gdp . 
  well , that 's what i understand at least . 
   but they also never miss a chance to take a cheap shot at the british . 
  the title was editorialized , there is no cheap shot at the british in the article , it only state the position of a few countries on the matter , among them the uk . 
  for france the figures are wrong . 
  here is the list for the weekly papers ( 2014 ) : http://www.ojd.com/chiffres/la-presse/la-presse-payante/presse-magazine * l'express * is ranked far behind maybe the numbers are for the media group as a whole , the [ group l'express ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/groupe_express-roularta ) owning a large number of titles . 
  here is the ranking for the daily papers : http://www.ojd.com/classement-personnalise/page/presse?section=1gp&amp;departement=0&amp;family=1&amp;thematic=0&amp;sous-thematic=0&amp;btn-filter-form=valider * 1 le figaro * 2 le monde * 3 l'\u00c9quipe ( sport daily ), 
  for the lack of public reaction from french officials , the papers here report that they do n't want to publicly embarrass merkel , officially the german-french relationship is as strong as ever , but behind the scene french foreign affairs are pissed and are asking some questions . 
  i do n't know where op found his title , but b. cazeneuve does n't say this sentence in the video . 
  and i 'm not sure he did elsewhere . 
  i think it 's a little bit more complicated than that . 
  when mittal bought arcellor in 2006 he made some promises to the government and in exchange , he got a sweet deal . 
  for instance he bought the gandrange steel factory for 1 symbolic euro . 
  those promises ( long term investments , no massive lay-off on some industrial sites ... ) had been broken by mittal . 
  now , mittal want to close the florange steel factory , with the consequences of another massive lay-off . 
  this factory make benefits , but apparently not enough for mittal , so he decided to just shut it down . 
  so the government told him , you did n't hold on your promises so if you want to disengage yourself from florange at least sell it to another steel operator to save the jobs . 
  mittal do n't want to do that because he does n't want to sell away the factory to a competitor . 
  he just want to shut it up and let it rot . 
  well as you can imagine , the workers are n't too happy about that . 
  neither is the government which could do without an another massive lay-off . 
  thanks for the link , that 's what i thought . 
  they state their negotiating position concerning the budget modifications proposal , like for any negotiation round but there is no ultimatum . 
  i wish i could speak the others european language to base my opinion on actual facts and original statements rather than on `` re-writing '' , hearsay and biased interpretations ... 
  i 'm sorry but i ca n't find a declaration by the french president threatening to veto the budget . 
  quote from this article :  paris wants eu farm subsidies to be kept at least at 2013 levels , and said it will threaten to veto the talks should cap spending be radically changed . 
  with a link to an article in french in which such a threat is n't made .
