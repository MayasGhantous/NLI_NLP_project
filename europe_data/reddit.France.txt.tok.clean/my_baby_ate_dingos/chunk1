what would we do without you gaggle of wankers ? 
  `` salad , tomato , a lot of onions and a big plate of byzantine fries on the side shukran jazeelan '' - muhammad ( pbuh ) , in the * hadith of the kebab * . 
  dude , you have a croissant on your flag , you could n't be threatened . 
  ... y' know what , i 'm going to lobby parliament to include a [ stylized kebab ] ( http://danhortonszar.com/clipart/assets/images/food-kebab.gif ) on the tricolour . 
  did n't lady ceaucescu insist during the trial that the presidential couple lived `` in a normal apartment like ordinary citizens '' ? 
  that 's because all your political parties are led by comedians , but most of them take themselves seriously . 
  i was way too young and too foreign to actually know anything about pmqs and much about uk politics . 
  plus , i was in scotland , which is mostly labour . 
  one of my first encounters with hague was [ this poster ] ( http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/o155820/be-afraid-be-very-afraid-poster-centurion-press/ ) , which never fails to make me chuckle , it 's such a cheap shot . 
  i 'm gon na be the one to go out and say it , and i do n't know how that 's going to be received , but i find bulgarian women on average really beautiful . 
  but then again i 'm particularly sensitive to eastern european charm , so ... :p otherwise , any country that takes its name from a steppe nomad tribe that once formed an empire actually called a ** khanate ** is badass in my book . 
  one could n't take a `` french khanate '' seriously , y' know ? 
  i 'll get to explaining : in the earlier years of the fifth republic , it was possible for the president ( elected by the people ) and the prime minister ( nominated by the president , usually following the dominant party in parliament ) to be from opposing sides . 
  it 's still theoretically possible now , but much less likely to happen . 
  mitterrand and chirac were in this situation , with chirac as mitterrand 's pm in 1988 , when they were the two candidates left for the presidential election of that year . 
  the two were famously antagonistic , primarily because mitterrand was an egotistical asshole . 
  during the presidential debate , chirac was desperate to level the playing field , as mitterrand 's position as president gave him an increased prestige and respect over chirac , who needed to appear similarly respectable . 
  so at the start of the debate , chirac said something to the effect of `` i know we have worked together in different settings , and i have always addressed you as `` mr. president '' . 
  today , we are not president and prime minister , we are two candidates on an equal footing , reaching out to the french people equally . 
  in this situation , i hope you will not take it as an offence if i simply call you mr. 
  mitterrand looked at him with a smile and responded `` you 're absolutely right , * mr. prime minister * . '', 
  and that was it . 
  mitterrand completely knocked over chirac 's effort to level the playing field , reminding everyone watching that `` screw you , remember that outside of this room , ** you work for me ** . 
  do n't go thinking we 're equals '' . 
  years later , a reporter was interviewing a former member of chirac 's staff who said that when mitterrand said his phrase , the chirac aides backstage all dropped and stopped watching , going `` welp , that 's it , mitterrand won the election . '', 
  mitterrand did end up winning . 
  chirac did n't become president until 1995 , after mitterrand had retired from politics . 
  reminds me of king juan carlos ' '' \u00bf por qu\u00e9 no te callas ? '', 
  to chavez . 
  also went memetic , too !, 
  hah , nice turnaround !, 
  my favorite putdown by an american politician is n't that funny . 
  it 's ron paul , in the 2012 primaries , absolutely destroying newt gingrich with `` when i was called , i was married and had two kids * and i went * '' on the subject of the draft . 
  not funny , but destroyed his argument in less that 'd ten words and ripped his balls out through his asshole . 
  powerful stuff . 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  i do n't know who came out of this more destroyed - blair , brown or the eu ? 
  i lived in the uk toward the end of the blair years , and i remember hague as a boring , humorless guy who did n't even have enough charisma to hold the tories in line . 
  i will revise that judgement . 
  also the time when he said of professional betrayer ( and later president ) sarkozy `` i need to stomp on this guy . 
  and with my left foot , it 'll bring me luck '' ( an old superstition in france is that stepping in shit brings good luck , but only if it 's with your left foot ), 
  i expected to find him in there , especially for the `` ugly/sober '' joke . 
  but i did n't know that one :  a sheep in sheep 's clothing it works on at least two levels , and it 's really subtle , you almost expect it to be a mistake at first ... that man was good . 
  in france , only two come to mind . 
  the first was from georges cl\u00e9menceau , a prime minister of the third republic at the time when the pm was the leader of the country . 
  cl\u00e9menceau was commenting on the scandalous death of president f\u00e9lix faure , in 1899 . 
  f\u00e9lix faure died of a heart attack while - or right after - having sex with his mistress , a married woman , right in the presidential palace . 
  literally `` he wanted to be caesar , and he died pompey '' . 
  the pun being that `` pomp\u00e9e '' can also be heard as `` pomp\u00e9 '' , which in this case means `` sucked '' . 
  so , `` he died sucked '' ... get the reference ? 
  everybody at the time sure did . 
  as for straight-up insults , i 'm mostly thinking of jacques chirac , president of france from 1995 to 2007 . 
  the quote comes from 1988 , at the time when he was only prime minister , while negotiating with margaret thatcher in a eu summit . 
  maggie was - as was her wont - insisting for heavy rebates and advantages for the uk . 
  literally , `` what else does that hag want , my balls on a plate ? '', 
  ... yeah , chirac was known to be classy . 
  oh , and his mic was on at the time . 
  in brittany , which retained a lot more celtic traditions than the rest of france , a farfadet is also called a [ korrigan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korrigan ) . 
  sometimes the name is also used to refer to water-spirits , similar to the british kelpies . 
  the tarasque myth is also interesting because it was intertwined with christian legend - the tarasque itself is quite probably a pre-christian myth , but it is described as being defeated once and for all by st. martha during the christianization of provence . 
  medieval france , especially in the central hills and highlands , in the alps and the south , had a lot of rampagning wolf packs . 
  a lot of folklore from the middle-ages concerns wolves . 
  on top of the beast of g\u00e9vaudan that / u/mnyx mentioned , you have the `` meneur de loups '' , ( literally `` wolf leaders '' ) , wizards that are supposed to speak the language of wolves and lead packs to attack humans . 
  but the most interesting legend is the voirloup , which is a bit like a werewolf : voirloups are sinners who have sold their souls to satan and undergo satanic ceremonies where they use a mixture made of sperm and blood to turn into wolves , or sometimes foxes , boars , and other animals . 
  they 're immortal , invincible , they can only be chased away and never killed . 
  they control fire and love to set barns and field aflame . 
  they do n't kill their victims , but instead drink their blood like a vampire . 
  they also have the ability to know when someone talks or writes about them , and they love to attack those who do once night falls . 
  agreed , but unfortunately , most of them are citizens of the countries they 're in , so it 's extremely tough to put together efficient measures without reneging on our democratic principles . 
  deportation - to where ? 
  death penalty - that 's barbaric . 
  prison - to what end ? 
  rehabilitation - is it even possible ? 
  knowing your politics , you 're probably familiar with the lenin quote `` the capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them '' . 
  i sometimes feel like western democracies handed the extremists the fuse with which they 'll blow themselves - and us - to bits ... 
  yes and no . 
  p\u00e9tain was indeed originally sentenced to death and had his death penalty commuted to life in prison , but there was more than one justification . 
  he was the hero of verdun , which merited some consideration , but charles de gaulle , when talking about his decision , famously said * `` la vieillesse est un naufrage '' * ( old age is a shipwreck ) . 
  meaning `` he did n't know what he was doing , he thought he was doing what was best , he was just an old fart with good intentions and terrible ideas '' . 
  i wonder what went through the graphic design guys ' heads when they got that phonecall . 
   government : `` we want your company to redesign all the banknotes that will be used in norway for the coming twenty years ''  graphic guy : * ^ ass ^ clenches *, 
  dude , do n't . 
  russians and jet planes , especially over ukraine , do n't mix well . 
  oh man , if i knew the flemings would give me gold for ripping on them , i 'd have started a long time ago !, 
  thanks man :d, 
  rarely , actually . 
  i ally france as soon as they get out of the hundred year 's war , because they usually rival castile when they can . 
  so we get a good relationship boost out of the common hatred of castile , and they 're pretty lenient on the border disputes . 
  then , if i get to absorb castile , i break my alliance with france immediately and ally austria/the netherlands/whatever holy roman empire power is at its peak right now , and count on them to balance out france . 
  wow , and i thought i 'd seen everything when i saw greeks and turks get into youtube flamewars over istanbul vs. constantinople ... 
  besides , we did n't * romanize * the walloons ... we * civilized * them . 
  you should be angry at us , but just because we did n't get far enough to the north and bring the gift to you . 
  when wwiii breaks out , we 'll make sure to have some sort of arm\u00e9e de terre ~ ~ division ~ ~ ~ ~ regiment ~ ~ ~ ~ platoon ~ ~ squad come along and protectoratize you . 
  we 'll make up for our neglect , promise !, 
  ... ew , do we have to ? 
  i 've seen what they get up to in their porn !, 
  taking a province in west africa , maybe in morocco or something , is a good spring board if you want to expand into ivory coast , congo and wherever else once you get colonists , since it 'll augment your colony range . 
  i did that as tuscany , and it worked out . 
  otherwise , stay out of africa until your european bases are solid and you do n't have threats at your back , because you 'll be putting down revolts and fighting muslim alliances for a long time .
