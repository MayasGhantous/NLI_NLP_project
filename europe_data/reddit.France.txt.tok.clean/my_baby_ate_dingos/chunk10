  there were 53 questions in that test , i didnt ' want to write a thesis :p, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.gotoquiz.com/politics/political-spectrum-quiz.html ) . 
  i agree it is us-centric , but i had no issue with the questions . 
  man , european traditions are in decline everywhere ... 
  what 's wrong with the term `` culture war '' ? 
  it 's sensationalist , but the phenomenon it describes is real enough ... 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.gotoquiz.com/politics/political-spectrum-quiz.html ) . 
  it 's us-centric for sure , but i had no issue relating to the questions . 
  ** you are a center-right social libertarian . 
  ** right : 2.27 , libertarian : 4.15 where are you in the culture war ? 
  on the liberal side , or the conservative side ? 
  this scale may apply more to the us than other countries . 
  ** you scored : -6.09 ** ( clear cultural liberal ) ** foreign policy : you scored : -1.71 ** ( slight non-interventionist ), 
  pretty much . 
  i think if / u/falconberger came to france or elsewhere in western or southern europe , he 'd still be ... ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) czeched out . 
  so , did your parents threaten you with bodily harm unless you studied to become a doctor ? 
  i 'm french , but i grew up in aberdeen . 
  emotionally , i like the idea of an independent scotland , but really i do n't know how it will develop if it does happen . 
  what about north sea oil revenue ? 
  will it go directly to scotland , or will the uk keep ownership of the fields ? 
  what about eu membership ? 
  what about other industries ? 
  what will the new independent scotland choose to develop as its flagship sectors ? 
  there are way too many questions , and i 'm not familiar enough with the subject to guess at the answers . 
  actually , the one time the unions went on strike and picketed the front door at a company i worked at , i came in to work through the back door . 
  so , what do you do 11 months out of 12 , then ? 
  cabbage ? 
  stop trying to trick him , everyone knows romania 's the capital of italy !, 
   i 've gone to the gun range , and had to go sit in the car to cry because the loud noises scare me . 
  that 's adorable . 
  and i say this without patronizing or condescension whatsoever . 
  there was colonialism , which was bad enough , and there was ~ ~ belgian congo ~ ~ congo free state ( belgium itself was n't fully responsible ) colonialism , which was on a whole other fucking level . 
  income tax , 2500 $ roughly 1.5 month 's worth each year , so that 's roughly 12.5 % . 
  ( i am rounding up here , i do n't pay exactly that much ) then there 's the habitation tax ( kind of like a council tax for brits ) , 1000 $ . 
  home ownership tax , a little less than that - 800 $ . 
  habitation tax for the separate garage i have ( yep , that 's a thing ) , 400 $ . 
  tv allowance , tax on my non-traditional income ( stocks , stuff like that ) , that was around 300 $ in total last year . 
  so all in all , i 'm at around 13.8 % of my salary going in taxes . 
  could be worse , and it will be worse if and when my income goes up , so i try not to complain , but it still stings like fuck when i get * that * letter in the mail . 
  edit : i did n't count payroll taxes and vat because i do n't `` see '' them . 
  suggestions for france/paris : even though i absolutely hate that movie , the one good thing about [ am\u00e9lie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/ ) is the atmosphere of paris depicted through the movie . 
  it 's a heavily romanticised version , but if that 's what you 're after ... 
  i liked french movie [ avis de mistral ] ( http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=221540.html ) but it 's going to be real hard to find , as it 's recent and probably not subbed ... a few american/international movies have captured it quite well too : [ paris , je t ` aime ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401711/ ) is pretty much the cliche you 'd expect it to be . 
  [ midnight in paris ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midnight_in_paris ) by woody allen is pretty good too . 
  does anyone have a cliff notes version ? 
  or a mirror ? 
  do n't worry guys , i 'm happily fulfilling both those stereotypes !, 
  france - i work 8 to 7 every weekday , have n't been on vacation since christmas and am not a member of a trade union . 
  the cigarette phase is just the traning wheels , man . 
  he skipped them and went directly for the bong . 
  i. . . feel more spanish that you are now , mate ... 
   i 've had more luck with foreign women who imagined it just because i 'm french . 
  that 's quite practical tbh . 
  a-fucking-men . 
  i 'm completely useless with french women , and i mean throw-their-drinks-in-my-face useless ( yes , it happened ) . 
  but when i go abroad and casually drop the fact that i 'm french ... yeah momma !, 
  the french socialist party is suffering from an ideological divide , there 's a party that has accepted the reality of the free market and necessity of budget restraint ... 
  but france being france , a large part of the party is still in its old keynesian mindset , planning the economy , taxing and spending and so on . 
  they 've tried to bridge that divide internally ( i used to be a member , so i know a bit about it ) , through dialogue between party bigshots and primaries . 
  now that they 're in power , it 's not working anymore , because they have a chance to actually implement policies and they just have to figure out which . 
  part of hollande 's staggering unpopularity in because his government appears divided , and rightly so . 
  dividing the party had been called for , but it would n't work . 
  the left would join the front de gauche and the greens , who are just as divided internally , incompetent and ultimately out of touch with voters . 
  the centre-left would be in an uncomfortable alliance with the centre udi , but would need to present an extremely coherent strategy and story to differentiate themselves from the right . 
  it would be an uphill battle , and would give the right-wing a few years in power while they collect the pieces . 
  that 's like ... at what point are you going to take the damn hint and call the wedding off , amadeus ? 
  i like my idea better :(, 
  wait , is n't the finnish embassy tacitly supporting criticism of an eu member 's internal politics ? 
  i mean , they have a right to do this , but they 're opening themselves to retaliation ... ( i do n't know what kind , just sayin ' ), 
  and in france , all the media can bring up is zero-hour contracts and `` yeah , but it 's because of shitty jobs !, 
  the uk has n't created proper jobs yet ! '', 
  and if you want to know : a `` proper job '' for a frenchman is a public service job working 9-4 in a post office reading 50 shades of grey for 35 years , occasionally telling `` customers '' ( although you 're not allowed to use that word in public service ) , before retiring at 55 to pensions paid for you by the private sector . 
  but i 'm not angry or anything ... 
  although the idea of general butt naked of liberia riding into battle with his dick out in a british challenger 2 tank does have a way of getting one 's attention ... 
   for me , it 's not about the skin color or race . 
  it 's about the culture and the mindset . 
  agreed . 
  as i said elsewhere in the replies , the second generation of immigrants to france have split between those that are further radicalised and those that are completely westernised . 
  i have an issue with the radicals ; the westernised immigrants are all fine in my book . 
  well actually , a white european and a black african are really genetically close . 
  closer than two people from opposite ends of europe are to each other . 
  so if i want the transplant to work , i 'll take the black guy over the white guy any fucking day of the week .
