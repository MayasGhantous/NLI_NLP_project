  you got any more questions ? 
  at last , a king who looks the part !, 
  oof ... well , with so many kings , i ca n't really give one answer : / depending on whether or not you consider him a monarch ( french historiography tends to separate his line from the kings of france ) , i 'd say ** napoleon i ** . 
  sure , he betrayed the revolution , but his legislative work served france well in the long run , and he made the rest of europe shit their pants , which is always fun . 
  ** henry iv ** - ended the wars of religion , ensured free practice to catholics and protestants , promoted the arts , restored paris , more of a diplomat than a warrior , and was assassinated before he could fuck up . 
  but my favorite has to be ** louis xi ** - hated his father for not taking the fight to the english sooner . 
  tried to remove him from power at the age of 17 . 
  was forgiven but exiled away from court to his own domain , where he continued to plot against his father until dad died and he became king . 
  surrounded himself with men of talent , not rank or noble blood . 
  got the english to renounce their claims to normandy through `` the force of p\u00e2t\u00e9 , meat and wine '' ( wining , dining and paying them until they went away ) . 
  dealt with his enemies by playing them against each other , brewing wars between them and executed those that did n't fall for it . 
  this is a man who was so far from giving a fuck it 's not even funny . 
  he had such a web of spies and plots and betrayals always ready that he was nicknamed `` the universal spider '' . 
  tell me that is n't badass . 
  that joke would have been funny enough if you were german , but i have to admit i burst out laughing when i saw your flair . 
  eh , white/black/brown / blue , these things are just skin color . 
  i 'm closer to a french black man of french culture than a white russian man of russian culture . 
  as i said , my issue is n't with skin color , it 's with cultural differences . 
  ( no offense to russians , i like you guys ), 
   hewitt exposes a culture of cheating ( everybody , it seems , knew the greeks were cooking the books to meet the criteria for entry to the single currency in 1999 ) iirc , france helped greece on this as well . 
  basically the french government told their greek counterparts `` we help you get into the euro even though you 're cheating , and you support us when we tell brussels to lay off our runaway deficits even though we 've signed pledges to control the deficit years ago . '', 
  i can totally see a mass migration of english people to scotland , to crush ~ ~ robert the bruce ~ ~ the `` yes '' campaigners . 
  word of advice : avoid the voting offices at stirling bridge and bannockburn , those ... are bad luck . 
  i could see myself supporting eugenics for genetic defects , anti-social personality disorders and stuff like that . 
  murderers and rapists i had n't thought of , but [ i 'd allow it ] ( http://derpy.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/137515631626.gif ) the problem is that giving the state the right to sterilize people is breaking a `` mental barrier '' regarding what the state can or ca n't do . 
  you start with that , and then the people start demanding sterilisation for other crimes , for financial irresponsibility ... give it a few years , and you 've got sterilisation for being `` anti-social elements '' or `` members of seditious communities '' , which is code for `` whoever the fuck the people in power want '' . 
  i feel it 'd be too much of a slippery slope . 
  was this law actually acted on , or was it one of these archaic bits that are still on the books but nobody follows them anymore ? 
  i believe france should give them every opportunity to live and work as they please in france . 
  i believe in allowing them to open prayer rooms and mosques , kebabs and halal shops , and so on . 
  i said above that i have an issue with another culture replacing traditional french culture , but to be fully honest , i do n't believe that is about to happen . 
  the second generation of immigrants from traditionally muslim countries is splitting into two groups - one which is radicalising farther and farther , and fueling the jihadi networks in the middle-east , and the other which is completely westernised and who 's turning away from tradition - if not from religion itself . 
  that 's why i 'm not all that worried and i will push for their freedom to live according to their culture . 
  the caveat , though , would be for these arrivals to respect a french saying , that may or may not exist in english , that goes `` freedoms of the ones end where the freedoms of the others begin '' . 
  that means that you 're free to live as you please as long as you respect the other 's rights , even if that 's not in your culture . 
  if your freedom means putting a burqa on your wife so nobody can see her face because she 's a foul temptress bringing men to sin , fuck your freedom . 
  if your freedom means catcalling women in the streets because unveiled women are all sluts , fuck your freedom . 
  if your freedom means booing the marseillaise at sports events because you want to be edgy , fuck your freedom . 
  and if your freedom means cutting off your daughter 's clitoris when she turns 12 ... fuck your freedom all the way back to sudan and i hope you get assraped by a buffalo on the way back . 
  that 's a subject i 'm a bit passionate about ... 
  anyway , to fully answer your question , my opinion of the recent arrivals is that they 're by and large well integrated into french society . 
  despite the horror stories about ghetto kids and riots , that 's not the majority . 
  we 're seeing a common situation of vocal minority , silent majority . 
  most immigrants study , most work , most respect others . 
  the immigrant community is undergoing a big change with its relationship to women , which is going to last another few years but is headed in the right direction . 
  so yeah , there 's still room for improvement but i honestly believe that france is in a good situation with its immigrant communities - despite the horror stories . 
  the picture is n't mine , but i 'm going to be swimming around [ here . 
  eh , i 'm not going to waste 5000 characters going in-depth about my definition of `` culture '' for a reddit post , so i went for the over-simplification . 
  at least people 'll read it !, 
  that happened before , in the '50s . 
  they have a name for that scenario , they call it a `` maracanazo '' . 
  i would n't put too much money on france . 
  deschamps did great work after the disgraces of 2010 and 2012 , but i do n't think he 's had enough time to heal all the wounds . 
  he 's done good work to stop the runaway egos as well , and eject the ones who would n't be reasoned with ( nasri for instance - good riddance , that guy 's a cunt ) , but it 's not enough . 
  my prediction - france will fall in the quarter finals . 
  as a frenchman , i 'd actually never heard that quote before !, 
  my issue with french identity is completely removed from any racial considerations . 
  i do n't care that there are more yellow french people , black french people and brown french people than white . 
  if aliens come to earth one day , i would be in favor of giving french citizenship to alien immigrants using the same laws as humans . 
  my issue is with culture . 
  if white people are to be a minority in france , so be it , but french culture and traditions must remain the majority . 
  a french man can come from seventeen generations of chinese on his father 's side and congolese on his mother 's , as long as he loves camembert and baguette and leaves work at 5 pm on friday to grab a glass of red wine on a bistro terrace , then i do n't care if he replaces the white majority . 
  if a non-white majority in my country means another culture becoming the norm ( the most obvious bogeyman being islam , of course ) then i have a problem with it . 
  `` why are their consuls so loud in public ? 
  why do they drive their carts so fast ? 
  ( hey , i have n't touched latin since middle school ... ), 
  you can add dino buzzati and primo levi to that list too - buzzati may not be as well-known , but i absolutely loved his books when i was a kid . 
  levi ... 
  i do n't remember who made me read his stuff when i was a kid as well , but fuck that person . 
  eh , that comment was mostly me making an off-color jokes about the massacres in the chechen wars of the 1990s and 2000s . 
  implying the war had depopulated the region . 
  because it 'd be like calling the frank proto-states french , or the germanic tribes that fought the romans at teutoburger wald germans . 
  cultures , population migration , states , way too much changed to be considered true predecessors . 
  edit : spelling . 
  i addressed that point in a comment below - it depends if you consider the roman empire an italian state ... 
  looks like the russians only occupied places with better weather than at home ... 
  depends , do you count the roman republic as an italian state ? 
  hey , you know what ? 
  i like that about italy . 
  all other nations compare dick sizes through their military records , but italy ? 
  war 's not your stuff . 
  you 've got literature , architecture , music , philosophy , art and food . 
  i 'd take pride in that if i were you . 
  that 's pretty much what i figured , i just needed some confirmation that op was a nutcase conspiracy scumfucker . 
   and if you think that 's not true , please try and tell me why us law  eu law/national law inside european countries according to our own governments re : nsa . 
  what does that mean ? 
  the french view of the us is extremely paradoxical . 
  yes , there is a lot of defiance and skepticism towards the us , but also a lot of admiration and imitation . 
  it 's a paradox nobody looks too closely at . 
  although i 'm sure the reason for this change is hollywood and cold war propaganda , this perception is not , strictly speaking , wrong . 
  the ussr fucked the wehrmacht up , through overwhelming numbers , patriotic fervor , and some really great generals , but the us contributed a lot . 
  not necessarily in military terms , but in industrial terms . 
  i checked out the numbers a few days ago , and the us supplied $ 50bn ( in 1940s dollars ) to the allies , including $ 31bn to the uk and $ 11bn to the ussr . 
  also , i 'm pretty glad they were the ones to liberate western europe . 
  i mean , if they 'd stayed out of it , france and the rest of the west would have spent 40 years as warsaw pact members . 
  no thanks . 
  you need chechens to have tensions with , mate ... 
  ai n't enough of them left ` round chechnya . 
  and they yell `` watch out ! '', 
  just before they punch .
