  nobody beyond teenage rebels and nostalgics of the ussr days seriously believe that they would create a working country . 
  so who 's left ? 
  the fn is the only one that has n't lost all credibility yet . 
  they are pro-state , they are very good at finding scapegoats for people 's trouble , they play on the mistrust of germany that has sprung up in france since the crisis , they promise things that are hard to implement , but also hard to scutinize , and the way all the other parties refuse to debate with them fuels their `` they 're just afraid of the truth ! '', 
  rhetoric . 
  credit where it 's due - the leader of the front the gauche is the only one who 's consistently ready and willing to debate marine le pen . 
  however , as i said above , she 's a great debater , and i have never seen her in a debate where she did n't come out looking like the winner , at least partly . 
  of course , when you know something about macroeconomics , you know how disastrous her policies would be for the country and for its workers . 
  i know that , but i 'm part of the upper-middle class , and it 's easy for me to consider these things when i do n't have to wonder if my next paycheck will cover my expenses . 
  there are many points in what you said , i 'll try to address them all . 
  regarding the one-sided media : this is an opinion i 've seen repeated a lot in and out of france , and i for one think it 's only partly justified . 
  first thing to take in mind is that the french political spectrum is farther left than ... well , any other in europe . 
  our socialist party still is n't sure whether they want to accept a free market economy : / so you will see the media reflecting opinions that are pretty far left , and even the `` right-wing '' media is n't so far to the right . 
  it is generally true that journalists , as a social group , are left-leaning . 
  in the 4 big daily , countrywide generalist newspapers , i can think of one that is right-leaning , two that are center-left , and one that is full-on anticapitalist left . 
  the big news channels are also left-leaning , in my opinion , with the exception of two - tf1 and bfmtv . 
  unfortunately , these two are also known for shitty journalism . 
  so yeah , as a foreigner reading french media , you could see it a one-sided deal . 
  you have to know where to look . 
  regarding the sarcasm : that 's something i have felt too . 
  it 's in the media , on both sides , though i see it more on the left . 
  it 's not that they see the right as `` backwards '' really , it 's more of a conspiracy theorist thought process . 
  in their minds , the free-market right are playing into the hands of the us in their global drive to destroy businesses everywhere so that us companies can take over ( replace `` us '' with `` china '' in the last few years ) and destroy the working class to give more money to shareholders . 
  i would also see it as a wider cultural issue . 
  let me explain : in france , doing business has long been a dirty activity . 
  anything that brings you success and wealth is seen as `` bad '' , because we as a culture can not imagine how you can gain money without exploiting people . 
  recently we had a bit of a political fight where entrepreneurs protested against new tax laws . 
  they were decried as `` vultures '' that only created businesses to sell them and make money on the sale , which was `` useless speculation '' for the media . 
  we also hate investment funds that turn failing businesses around because they restructure the businesses and sell them . 
  basically , making money is bad . 
  then what 's good ? 
  ** intellect ** . 
  being a researcher , a professor , a humanities expert , a philosopher , a writer . 
  these cerebral professions are the holy grail for french society , and we respect those very , very much . 
  the notion of `` ivory tower '' exists in france , but it 's not used very often because the ivory tower is actually something to be respected , not decried . 
  you will notice that most of the professions i mentioned above do n't bring in much money , except when you hit a big success . 
  the intellectual professions tend to be more left-leaning . 
  the business professions tend to be more right-leaning . 
  it 's easy , then , to think `` left good , right bad '' , and you see that reflected in the media . 
  however , i have to add two disclaimers to all this : first , this is my opinion . 
  second , i am only referring to `` left '' and `` right '' in economic terms . 
  if we add in societal values and factors , this whole thing becomes even more complicated . 
  of course not , we ca n't do that !, 
  i ca n't believe you 'd suggest such a thing !, 
  if we want to sell a bunch of things to the us , we 'd have to invest in our businesses and be competitive !, 
  and do n't you know that businesses are evil , and competitiveness is bad ? 
  it 's too fucking easy . 
  when the fn candidate won 25 % of the presidential vote , it was because the electorate was voting for a person and not for a program . 
  or it was because sarkozy had willingly helped normalize their ideas in order to weaken the socialists . 
  when the fn won 8 towns in the mayoral elections , it was already because the media had been too lenient on them ( apparently ) now it 's again the fault of the media . 
  it 's always ** anything ** , as long as we can avoid considering that maybe their ideas are actually gaining ground , and ask why . 
  head , meet sand !, 
  if we avoid any meaningful debate on their program , surely they will lose traction and go away !, 
  that 's worked spectacularly well for the past 25 years !, 
  i do have to give them one point , though : marine le pen is a spectacular debater and media personality , nicknamed `` steamroller '' among journalists . 
  the media is n't actually lenient with her , they just appear so because the journalists ca n't counter her debating tactics . 
  i would have mentioned kems ... never heard of it outside of france . 
  sorry to jump on something only tangentially related , but ...  there was just a scandal ( still going on ) about a school going completely rogue and under muslim control . 
  waiiiiiiiiit , what ??? 
  i googled that and found something about birmingham , is that what you 're referring to ? 
  basically , the argument goes : less tariffs = easier to export goods to europe = easier to produce them elsewhere = easier to outsource manufacturing jobs . 
  yes , these are people for whom the concept of a `` service economy '' is completely foreign . 
  the kind of nutjob you see , like op , would indeed prefer poland and the others out of the eu , but they wo n't say it because it would be racist . 
  although they do fight some of the free movement directives of brussels ... 
  instead , they would like to raise polish wages immediately to western european levels to make sure poland ca n't `` unfairly '' compete with western europe . 
  never you mind that it would bust poland 's economy , but at least dey wo n't turk ur jurbs . 
  also , jobs will be outsourced to the u.s. , not mexico , because apparently the u.s. is a third world country now . 
  bunch of protectionist filth , but ah well . 
   all ftas are negotiated in secret . 
  thank god , can you imagine this shit being opened up to the public ? 
  nothing would get done , every little `` concerned villagers the cultural heritage of bumfucknowhere '' group would want to weigh in on the negotiations ... 
  on principle , i agree . 
  the issue is the way it is implemented in the end . 
  the one example i think about it as follows : if france , for instance , restricts the sale of cigarettes in order to disincentive people to smoke , could the state be open to legal action from us cigarette companies ? 
  usually , i would n't mind , but if it interferes in matters such as public health , i do n't think anyone should influence the state . 
  otherwise , i agree that there 's a lot of fearmongering around it , and on principle investors do need to be protected . 
  the question is , up to which point ? 
  my only issue with tafta is the isds . 
  anything that supersedes national laws should be ratified by parliament or by a referendum . 
  apparently , though , there are talks of dropping the isds from the treaty . 
  if that happens , then let 's go for it . 
  the link mentioned protests but i was thinking rocks , maybe flares ... 
  well , the french government belongs to a pro-schultz party indeed . 
  but i can only hope that the effort wo n't succeed , that would be another nail in the eu 's coffin . 
   if they have no problem bending over and getting help from the worst beings walking on this planet come on , man , that 's an indefensible position you have here . 
  if the russian tanks were rolling down the champs-elys\u00e9es , massacring my family and everyone i care about , and the only being willing to help me was satan himself , i 'd grab the first black chicken i could find and ask `` so , where 's the paper i have to bleed on and sign ? '', 
  but ... why now ? 
  it 's a battle he can never win . 
  if the tories had pushed for another ppe candidate before the elections , then sure , but juncker and the ppe have won the elections fair and square , and all the other countries are ready to accept him . 
  he could have taken the hit and managed it nationally , but now he 's either going to appear weak , or force the issue on 27 other countries . 
  in either case , he 's going to be hurt bad . 
  are you israeli jewish , american jewish or european jewish ? 
  or maybe from elsewhere ( are there any beta israel left in ethiopia ? ), 
  if you are israeli , or even european , then you must know that this has happened before and will happen again . 
  we offer condolences when people die , the culprit is caught , and in a few months the next nutjob coming back from syria will shoot up a synagogue , a jewish school , a kosher store , a memorial . 
  even if i did n't particularly care about the jews ( and i do , goy that i am , since half my family is jewish ) , nobody wants more people to die senselessly . 
  i have seen a lot of anger in that thread , but not that much overt hatred or racism ( of course , there is some ) . 
  i am mostly interested in discussing the why of it , why is it that muslims have `` taken over '' far-righters as the most anti-semitic groups ? 
  are they radicalizing , and if so , why ? 
  what should we do about it ?
