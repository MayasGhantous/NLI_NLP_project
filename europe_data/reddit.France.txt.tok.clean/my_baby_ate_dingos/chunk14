  ignoring it will not do anything good . 
  i was expecting ( and hoping for , really ) , a far-right nutjob conspiracy theorist thinking the jews are behind the illuminati who are behind the new world order who 's behind israel and so ... 
  i guess occam 's razor disagreed . 
  the program is pretty scary . 
   land , its subsoil , water , flora and fauna , as well as major industrial and financial assets created by `` the labor of the people , '' are public property , and can not be privately owned . 
  large property , industrial and financial assets will be owned by the state . 
  remuneration of each person will be measured by the `` usefulness of [ one 's ] work to society . '', 
  land ca n't be privately owned ? 
  all large property owned by the state ? 
  remuneration measured by the worth of one 's work - measured by whom ? 
  i think [ this guy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/lenin.jpg ) would be proud . 
   the state allows for freedom of religion except in cases it deems would `` destroy the fabric of society and social harmony . '', 
  that last bit is way too open-ended to be anything but a right to crush anything you deem destructive . 
  also , i do n't see a mention of universal suffrage by the people anywhere . 
  that 's not good ... 
   wealth transfer from u.s. taxpayers to bloated european welfare states yeah , that 's true . 
  i 'm glad the us protected us from the terrible world threat of iraq , or how they were the tip of the spear to protect our forces when the west wanted to safeguard mali !, 
  i hear crimea has a lot of free room these days ... 
  it 's not just `` a different vision of how the eu should function '' . 
  it 's near-blackmail to influence a result . 
  not only that , but it comes after the uk electorate and media has complained multiple times about a lack of democracy , a talking point that was picked up by uk politicians . 
  all of a sudden , after the most democratic eu election since its inception ( because we finally get to elect a president , not just an ineffectual parliament ) , cameron turns around and tries to force the issue . 
  seriously , the uk has lost every bit of diplomatic goodwill it ever had in brussels and strasbourg . 
  i do n't know what kind of a gamble he 's making , but i do n't see him coming out of this as winner . 
  your point then is that it 's a vicious circle , and i will readily agree . 
  i also do n't dispute the fact that it 's a chicken-and-egg situation , with prejudice causing radicalization , which causes further prejudice . 
  my issue then , taking that chicken-and-egg situation , is who should make the first move ? 
  i 've argued in another subreddit that , in the case of the roma , the european societies should be make the first move , as the roma ca n't get legitimate income without a fixed place to stay , therfore we need to let them live in a single place without chasing them away . 
  in the case of the muslim immigrant communities , though , i will make the opposite case . 
  why ? 
  because terrorist networks that pervert islam and recruit among the disadvantaged immigrant communities are extremely dangerous - not just for europe , but for other governments elsehere in the world , even in the middle-east . 
  if we want to reach out to them , which i agree would help a lot , we must see some willingness to negotiate or even disarm from them , and a clear mass movement from the non-radical muslims against these groups . 
  we 're beginning to see it here - more and more muslim individual and groups `` inform '' on radical elements and protest against radical speakers or mosques . 
  i think that 's the first step we need . 
  i 'd be surprised if it ended up being a new country . 
  if it does n't go back into the ukrainian fold at the end of the crisis , it surely wo n't be recognized by any european countries . 
  at most , we 're witnessing a news transdnistria or abkhazia . 
  you say you do n't want to excuse their behavior , and yet that 's precisely what i hear in your comments . 
  of course , by excusing their behavior , i do n't mean you think we should let that guy go . 
  however , i get the sense that you 're trying to explain all of a minority 's behavior through their relationship with the majority , and that 's just not accurate . 
  there are cultural factors that are internal to the minority group for one , and economic situation factors ( like the current crisis ) that are more complicated than `` white people rich , brown people poor '' . 
  there are those who react by joining anti-racist groups , becoming activists , or even going into politics , and that 's fine . 
  if you turn to crime or extremist terrorism instead , i do n't think any amount of discrimination can come close to explaining , much less justifying that . 
  it depends where ... 
  the far-right ideology is restrictive and structured enough to be called a religion in and of itself , but actually most of the french ( at least , 'cause that 's the ones i know ) far-right wingnuts are secular or even atheist . 
  technically you 're right , but let 's not excuse them too much . 
  yes there is discrimination and racism , glass ceilings and everything , but can you really say that they 're treated as second-class citizens ? 
  they 're not turned away from education because of their religions , they 're not forbidden to practice ( well , in france , there is the matter of public practice of religion , but that affects everyone ) and so on . 
  and on top of that , ~ ~ if ~ ~ when they do face discrimination , they have organizations and authorities to turn to that will give them recourse . 
  i do n't know about sweden , but here at least , anti-discrimination laws are upheld and organizations are vigilant about it - as they should be . 
   they face prejudice ( ... ) which their upbringing has taught them is wrong their upbringing has taught them it 's wrong * when it happens to them * . 
  seriously , take france , there is a shocking amount of arab-on-black racism , black-on-arab , black-on-asian ... 
  it is incredibly violent , at least verbally , and so widespread that i ca n't in good conscience say it 's just individuals , it 's stuff they 're taught at home . 
  it 's like white people have been left behind in the racism race ... 
  pretty much . 
  the actual first-gen immigrants , as a rule , know exactly what they 've left behind and they 're grateful for the chance to have an actual life . 
  my gf had a conversation like that with one of the ladies who clean her office building , she came away chastised . 
  funny thing is , the second-gen do n't know how good they have it because they 've never known anythign else , so even those who do n't fall to extremism either end up romanticizing their country of origin or despising france/the uk/germany/spain / whatever . 
  which leads to a funny phenomenon : when they go back to the country of their parents , usually on holiday , they either badmouth their european country to anyone who will listen , lord their money over the locals , or loudly proclaim how `` authentic '' they are despite never living in the culture . 
  which leads the locals to go `` wtf m8 , do n't fuck with us , you 're white '' . 
  seiously , i had that talk with local algerians , they ** hate ** the second generation of french algerians, 
  first case , seriously ? 
  i do n't have other examples in mind , but that ca n't be right . 
  shit , you know what ? 
  i had n't even considered how the bosniak muslims must feel about it ... 
  i only thought about it because i want to avoid fueling the far-righters more than they already are . 
   most of europe was an enemy to most of europe at different points in history . 
  they 're just on an island . 
  which changes a lot , because while most of europe fought itself , the last time a foreign army landed and rampaged across britain was in 1066 . 
  there never was a division of soldiers camped out in trafalgar square , unlike the champs-elys\u00e9es or most other plazas in european capitals . 
  with the exception of the blitz in ' 44 , wars have never had the same immediate stakes for britain than for continental europe . 
  when i saw `` frenchman '' and `` marseille '' , i kinda thought `` please do n't be muslim please do n't be muslim ... 
  dammit ! '', 
  never fucking fails . 
  this person has the truth of it . 
  i would like to add a few aggravating factors though : the first thing you have to realise is that because of its island status , and the fact that it was an enemy to most europe at different points in its history ( germany , spain , and of course france ) , britons do n't really feel like europeans . 
  that makes the whole `` europe is the natural evolution of nations '' argument moot for them . 
  on the other hand , there is a lot of resentment in brussels towards the uk . 
  whether or not it 's justified , the perception is that the uk has fought for preferential terms when joining the eu and still has specific conditions for no other reason than because they 're the uk . 
  this creates a bad atmosphere in diplomatic negotiations where diplomats will fight uk proposals as a form of revenge , which does n't encourage the uk to stay in the union . 
  if i may ask , if their policies are so obviously shitty , and they advertised that , how come they made it to power ? 
  did bogans suddenly remember how to vote ? 
  technically , you 're right , and ** as long as the quotas are upheld ** i am not personally against seal hunting . 
  whaling is different given most whale species ' conservation status . 
  however , the fact remains that public opinion in the eu is massively against seal hunting , most probably because a seal is cuter than a a cow . 
  as long as the powers that be are following public opinion , the ban is legitimate and the wto should n't overturn it , like it has n't . 
  when you 're so guilty your lawyer kills himself rather than having to defend you , you know you 're in deep shit . 
  unless , of course , he `` was suicided '' , which is n't that improbable . 
  i agree with this guy . 
  the racists must be free to spout their shitty opinions , and the rest of society must be free to show them facts and stats and science to explain how shitty and inaccurate their opinions are . 
  silencing them in the name of hate speech is useless and actually validates their `` they 're just afraid of the trooth hurr durr '' outlook . 
  some of france 's radical left-wing groups attacked the paris bicycle-rental stations , because of a new measure that means if you 're found guilty of vandalism on said bicycles , you can be sentenced to community service in their bike repair workshops . 
  they screamed `` slave labor ! '', 
  and vandalised the bike stations . 
  no matter that people actually use them to get around , the important thingis sticking it to the man \u2122, 
  i do n't really expect there would be a lot of romanian-french interpreters and translators in the middle of bumfuck nowhere , bouches-du-rh\u00f4ne , france . 
  they probably ran it through google translate once or twice . 
  as a frenchman , i fucking hate the acad\u00e9mie . 
  perhaps it 's because i have an interest in linguistics , most french people do n't care either way . 
  but they are dedicated to the old days when france 's infuence was strong enough to make the french language the lingua franca .
