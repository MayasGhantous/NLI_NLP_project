  not being able to understand that those days are past , even under the cover of `` protecting the french language '' means freezing our tongue within itself , without external additions ... 
  they 're a result of the mindset that causes french people to absolutely suck at speaking english , among other things . 
  lucky nobody cares , i guess ... 
   in eastern europe , rules exist so people would find a way to get around . 
  ah , yes , the ol' post-soviet reflexes ? 
  i 'm with you on this . 
  which is why i also agree with the ( admittedly strict ) rules the town put forward . 
  it gives them one chance , just one . 
  they can act like adults and drop the bad habits or choose to carry on and face the consequences . 
  while i disagree with immediate expulsion everytime a roma band settles somewhere , i would also disagree with a town saying `` please settle down , have our power and water , no questions asked . 
  do you want our cables with that ? '', 
  there is a small village in the south of france where the authorities have accepted the gypsies and lent them land to settle on , municipal water and power , and provided basic housing ( tents , some old caravans ) . 
  you think , why would they do that ? 
  and so did i at first . 
  but they imposed a set of regulations : - gypsy children all go to the local school ( the authorities receive reports every day on which child is there and which is n't ) - no more than 80 people at one time in the camp - alcohol consumption is forbidden , as is begging in the village - the camp must be regularly cleared of trash . 
  they even had them sign a [ bilingual pact ] ( http://apps.rue89.com/gardanne/img/charte_roms.pdf ) so everyone could understand ( . pdf , in french and what i assume is romanian ) . 
  each family signed one . 
  failure to respect one of these rules means the family implicated is thrown out , no second chances . 
  and you know what ? 
  it works !, 
  there was one classic case of copper theft , three families were ordered to leave within 48 hours and did so . 
  otherwise , the roma respect the rules . 
  the three burglaries that took place in the region were investigated , and found to be perpetrated by a local gang that was hoping the gypsies would be the perfect suspect . 
  otherwise , it works . 
  i guess having a place to stay , heating and clean water encourages you to behave . 
  my point is , yes , the gypsies need to get their shit together . 
  but there should be more cases like that village . 
  if we give them a bit , a `` carrot '' , and say `` look , you get this and you 're all happy , but do n't . 
  '' , i think they , like all normal people , would take the chance to be a normal part of the community . 
  that 's the thing about the roma . 
  the children . 
  living in paris , i 've had to slap a few hands away from my bag ( i carry a man-purse , sue me . 
  i 'm fabulous ! ) . 
  often , it 's a roma , and 90 % of the time , is a girl who looks to be under 14 . 
  i would divide france in three categories : paris , other cities , then towns and countryside . 
  paris has a specific building style from the 1890s , the [ haussmann style ] ( http://imganuncios.mitula.net/superbe_appartement_5_pieces_dans_un_bel_immeuble_haussmannien_a_un_prix_raisonnable_97852355468376612.jpg ) , most of these buildings are still residential although more and more are being turned into offices as rent becomes too high for ... well , anyone . 
  in other large cities , housing blocks are more recent , like [ this ] ( http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3311/aaaamarengo6zl.jpg ) in toulouse . 
  sometimes they turn a bit more artsy , sometimes they 're derelict projects . 
  note that this is by no means an absolute - paris has recent construction and vice versa , i 'm just describing trends . 
  the smaller cities and countryside are the only places where you can afford a house , with a back yard and all . 
  the [ coron ] ( http://jl.franchomme.free.fr/wallers_arenberg002.jpg ) style is the old miner housing in the north , [ this style ] ( http://www.maison-en-provence.com/photos/p532-chateau-de-roussillon-la-maison-2.jpg ) of small-windowed house in the south to keep the cool air in , and anything in-between . 
  because there is a lot of resentment towards the uk from other eu politicians . 
  i wo n't argue whether or not it 's justified , but the thatcher years of `` i want my money back '' and fighting for rebates tooth and nail left a sour taste for most eu diplomats that still lingers today . 
  i am reminded of jacques chirac 's quip at an eec summit , during his prime ministership in the '70s , where maggie was again arguing for preferential terms for the uk . 
  chirac turned to one of his aides and said in french `` qu'est - ce qu'elle veut , la m\u00e9g\u00e8re , mes couilles sur un plateau ? '', 
  translated : `` what more does that hag want , my nuts on a plate ? '', 
  my point being , i think it possible that a new bloc outside of the eu would exclude the uk in order to avoid a repeat of that , or maybe just as petty revenge . 
  i do n't know , this was ... too awfully well-timed with french politics to really just be about the message . 
  i do n't know how it is in other eu countries , but most times a french politician says something about the eu , especially in french media , the intended audience is n't europe , but voters at home . 
  i would n't expect this to be an exception . 
  i wish conchita would stop being so ... hot . 
  my penis is really confused . 
  well , actually , belay that . 
  there 's nothing confused about * this * bad boy . 
  you know ... for science . 
  hypothesis : the introduction of tumblr in the american environment contaminated the parameters . 
  putting tumblr in close proximity to niceness tends to alter niceness 's natural properties until it completely turns into passive-aggressiveness . 
  some collected samples : `` please go die  '' and `` kill yourself ( \u25e1 \u203f \u25e1 \u273f ) '', 
  - probably little to do with genetics , more with differences in style and culture . 
  if you use different products ( soaps , shampoos ) , have different haircut styles , it will change something about your appearance . 
  also , american white people do n't really come from the `` same stock '' as european white people , anymore . 
  seriously , listen to white americans , it 's like every one of them is 1/64 cherokee or 1/256 mexican or 1/1600 black . 
  and they should know , they 've checked . 
  - `` niceness under laboratory conditions '' ... what the fuck ? 
  i 've actually experienced the opposite . 
  americans are more superficial when it comes to friendships , but way nicer . 
  if we accept your hypothesis as true though , i 'd say one of the reasons is a difference in group ideology . 
  most european states are more about forming a coherent society rather than allowing the individual free reign like it is in the us . 
  that permeates every aspect of society . 
  i understand the reasoning , even though i do n't necessarily agree with it . 
  but looking at the practical side of things , is n't 1k euros a ludicrously low threshold ? 
  it was pretty much supposed to be dutch jar jar binks . 
  i call him jaap jaap binks . 
  i write as much dutch as working for a year and a half with a bunch of gouda-grazers will let me ... 
  which is to say , not much . 
  hey , i never said it was a * good * joke ... 
  meesa echta blija about livings in otoh amsterdama !, 
  dis gon be mucho awesome and ontzagwekkenda si ? 
  well , it was n't all life , just serbia . 
  unless god intends to build from there , and serbia 's just the prelude . 
  austria is the new tower of babel . 
  nope . 
  it 's the gays . 
  all the gay sex going on disperses energy into the atmosphere , which contributes to global warming . 
  god is kind of a single-issue wonk , is n't he ? 
  it 's always about the gays , is n't it ? 
  it could n't be , i do n't know , a sign of god 's disapproval of ratko mladic 's actions , as his trial starts ? 
  i mean , have you * read * the old testament ? 
  i would n't put it past god to flood a whole country of innocents to spite one guy ... 
   world cup : didier deschamps released the final list of the national team . 
  three days after that , mandanda got injured . 
  immediately after , samir nasri 's girlfriend protested against his not-selection by tweeting * `` fuck france and fuck deschamps !, 
  '' * she 's about as classy as her boyfriend . 
  [ walking into this thread . 
  the balkans just ca n't catch a fucking break . 
  i 'll give my piece to caritas , but does anyone know if any other ngos are already on site ? 
  them and the south africans . 
  the sou ` fricans have some delicious dry whites . 
  uk vs. germany . 
  i 'd pay to see that .
