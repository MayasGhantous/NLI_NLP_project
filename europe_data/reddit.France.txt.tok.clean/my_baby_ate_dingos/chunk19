  i mean , they 're a bunch of wankers , but i ca n't imagine the brits have a special tendancy for child abuse or something . 
  i 'm just wondering what sordid stuff is being covered up elsewhere in europe . 
  i do n't know , the guy with the tattoos is looking at it like `` dude , you really want to get that checked out , that lump should n't be there . '', 
  username checks out . 
  this comment section was the last place i expected to see that . 
  and yet ... it 's strangely appropriate . 
  no points for guessing who caesar is then . 
  you just ruined that gif for me . 
  yes . 
  boobs . 
  just recently , we had [ rihanna topless ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7qvs-df8mkm/u1_z5q8hugi/aaaaaaabozu/5q8axqhjnmg/s1600/rihanna-by-mario-sorrenti-for-lui-magazine.png ) ( nsfw obviously ) on the cover of a lad 's magazine here . 
  they plastered the cover on what seemed like literally every bus , bus stop and newspaper kiosk in paris to advertise . 
  that was fun , nobody cared . 
  it was a little less prominent when i was a kid but it did happen . 
  and on outdoor advertising , on leaflets , in bootleg hentai manga , and basically anywhere you could potentially find boobs as a 14yo . 
  in france . 
  actually it 's fricking hilarious , you just do n't have a very good cross-cultural understanding of our sense of humor . 
  tell me about it . 
  denying nudity to 14 year olds is n't just useless , it 's fucking cruel . 
  do these guys not remember what it was like being 14 !, 
  hey , young kittens are the scourge of ankles everywhere , they 're pretty dangerous . 
  hey , we like it . 
  here i am , bored like a croat on a saturday night , trying to jostle through the queue at the boulangerieto get a baguette before the day 's batch turns 4 hours old , when all of a sudden and american tourist with a cowboy hat and a hawaiian shirt bursts through from the back , waving a colt python and demanding that we rename the pain au chocolats to `` freedom croissants '' before he `` gives us back to germany '' . 
  you do n't get entertainment like that outside of the tourist season !, 
  and besides , with communist healthcare like ours , that nasty bullet hole in my nether regions will be patched pretty quick . 
  ( sorry , croats . ), 
  while i agree that france was responsible for gaddafi 's fall , which was a nearsighted and incredibly ill-advised move ( which i unfortunately supported at the time ) , i just want to dispute a tiny point . 
  the refugees are n't libyan , they 're generally from sub-saharan africa , transiting through libya as it has the shortest sea distance to europe ( with the exception of gibraltar , where there is a whole other crisis ) . 
  gaddafi 's government held them in camps and prisons , turned them back , and generally stopped them from coming over . 
  now that it 's anarchy , every economic migrant and political refugee can make it through . 
  gaddafi had promised a `` flood of migrants '' if he was removed from power . 
  i used to think it was typical bullshit coming from the guy . 
  he was n't kidding . 
  that 's actually almost heartwarming . 
  `` i hate you , you hate me , that 's cool , let 's fight against the people who want us to love each other ! '', 
  the splendid thing about anti-semitism : it 's the only thing to unite muslim extremists and far-right extremists . 
  hell , even the [ grand mufti of jerusalem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haj_amin_al-husseini#ties_with_the_axis_powers_during_world_war_ii ) in ww2 was a nazi supporter . 
  note that these guys are one flavor of the far-right in france , the catholic religious one . 
  on top of that , we have the organization called the bloc identitaire , which is n't overtly religious . 
  they 're hardcore anti-immligration and anti-islam too , but not from a faith angle , rather from a wider cultural angle . 
  their latest coup was forming `` anti-scum '' brigades in the lille metro , ostensibly to combat muggers and pickpockets . 
  a lot of its members have a troubled history with the front national , being former members that were excluded , that sort of thing . 
  oh , i do n't have stats , but i think it 's tiny . 
  ransoming westerners is irregular , you never know how much the governments are going to be willing to pay/not pay , it depends on the nationality of the hostage and whatnot , so it 's got ta be a lot less reliable than extorting local populations or getting handouts from rich radical islamists in the gulf or wherever . 
  still , one euro is a euro too much , eh ? 
  ( oh , and happy cakeday btw ! ), 
  i agree , a life is a life and that 's worth much more than money . 
  but i wish there was an easier way to save said life than to ( indirectly ) finance terrorist activities ... 
  i still have n't gotten over trafalgar , but i accepted that we 're never going to beat the british at sea . 
  which is why we dug the chunnel . 
  next time ` round , you tea-drinking sods wo n't even see us coming !, 
  nah , one of our citizens was held by aqim for over three years , and there used to be almost half a dozen french hostages held by different branches of al-qaeda or the mujao . 
  they hold western hostages for ransom . 
  a lot of western powers - france included , unfortunately - pay ransoms secretly in order to guarantee their citizens ' safety , believing that paying is worth not getting one of their nationals killed . 
  they also use them for propaganda purposes . 
  they think forcing them to act like they 've converted and joined the jihadist cause will influence western citizens at home . 
  what is n't ? 
  britain leaving the eu or the subsequent chaos ? 
  i do n't have a before/after picture , but [ this is what mr. rijke looks like in the video the french special forces took of him ] ( http://media.nu.nl/m/m1oxptfaa6cb_wd1280.jpg/ontvoering-van-sjaak-rijke-in-vier-videos.jpg ) . 
  i 'm surprised at that last point . 
  we had weekly reminders in the national evening tv news to remember french citizens held hostage around the world , updates on the situations in africa and the middle east always included a word on the hostages ... for instance in the end , everyone in france knew who serge lazarevic was , and so on . 
  the netherlands never did anything similar ? 
  i expected that one to show up !, 
  but you 're still a right bunch of silly wankers . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ got ta ^ ^ ^ ^ keep ^ ^ ^ ^ up ^ ^ ^ ^ appearances ^ ^ ^ ^ mate !, 
  [ nice one !, 
  nobody knew the guy was there , he was wearing a djellabah , and he 's had to grow the islamist bigass beard during his imprisonment . 
  i 'm just pleasantly surprised he did n't get mistaken for a djihadist and shot on the spot . 
  i 'm surprised the brits do this sort of thing , i thought it was more of a yank thing . 
  i mean , as you said , we fought each other all over the world - i think nobody knows the worth of a french soldier better than a brit :p ( and as a frenchman , mad respect to the british armed forces , you guys are impressive . ), 
  are you ... trying to make a scotsman * work * ? 
  good luck . 
  but now it 's istanbul , not constantinople . 
  hey !, 
  do n't go telling everyone the secret greeting for the bundeswehr we crafted decades ago , you never know when we 'll need to use it !, 
   somebody invades and the army will avoid putting up much of a fight . 
  they 'll empty the magazines , take what equipment they can and then begin a guerrilla campaign . 
  sounds somewhat like operation gladio . 
  nato forces never really intended to let the reds win and start the guerilla , but they did have a whole plan to make western europe too hard to hold in case of defeat . 
  come on guys , get into it !, 
  fight for the position of unhappiest european country !, 
  maybe you could try and make each other happier to boost the other 's stats ? 
  [ i can sooooooooooooorta see why though ] ( http://www.dudek.org/blog/blogpics/icegirls.jpg?display= ), 
  france 7.0 ?!, 
  have my depressed , killjoy countrymen finally realised life is n't so bad ? 
  or is it just all those pills they pop finally kicking in ? 
  i mean , when you 're high off your tits on prozac , life 's awesome . 
  i guess the fs s\u00e9bastien chabal would be touching a sensitive spot ? 
  i would n't assume so . 
  most of the potential republican candidates are distanced from the bush years and his team . 
  unless the americans elect an unrepentant colossal prick like rick perry or that god-blowing pompous anus rick santorum , i do n't think most republican candidates out there would throw out strategic collaboration because of old differences . 
  then again , i may be giving the gop too much credit . 
  well france has definitely been taking a much more active role in military and strategic matters lately . 
  what 's left to find out is as you say , whether it 's a long-term paradigm shift or just fran\u00e7ois hollande 's personal direction . 
  [ so , kinda like arby 's then ? 
  ] ( http://cdn1.techbargains.us.com/icache/2014/08/06/140736615870239.jpeg ), 
  well , jeanne d'arc is an important figure for all french people ( i 'm not well-informed enough to say whether she historically was or whether jules michelet did indeed invent her legend ) . 
  the far-right likes to take her as a symbol , but it 's not theirs to own . 
  it 'd be a good idea to reclaim it . 
  although naming a common french-british carrier after a figure known for fighting the english during the war would be a faux pas .
