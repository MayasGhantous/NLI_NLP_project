  still , cases like the corsican ferry strike or the train strike we had recently were completely f 'd up . 
  * twitch * please do n't bring that up again . 
  we ... do n't like to talk about it . 
  what i mean when i say `` but unions now are n't the same as unions then '' , is that back then ( meaning the late 1800s to , say , the 1940s ) , unions were facing industrialists that would : - exploit children , - employ security forces to terrorize workers into obedience ( henry ford anyone ? ), 
  - do whatever they wanted with workers ' salaries because minimum wage did n't exist , - fire a guy for being sick for one day and so on , and so forth . 
  unions fought , influenced the public , the state , and won basic rights , that have been built on since then . 
  now , however , unions are still acting and talking as though they were facing robber barons . 
  some of the left-leaning redditors here will probably disagree with me , but i believe the fundamental nature of worker-employer relations has changed , because the state and the public can intervene and protect . 
  therefore , when i say that unions now are n't the same as unions then , i mean that the unions as they are now are n't the force for worker 's rights and human & economic development that they were decades ago . 
  that 's not the only reason - as i said , some have evolved into special interest groups , as well . 
  that 's why i think we need different unions - ones that were n't founded in the old times of worker 's exploitation and are n't stuck in these ways of thinking . 
  because having no unions is n't an option , we need a balancing force , but a constructive one instead of a confrontational one . 
  `` mustache-in-chief '', 
  unions won the workers their rights , but unions now are n't the same as unions then . 
  some have become special interest groups , looking out for very small populations of workers . 
  others are stuck in the 19th-century way of thinking , when the economic paradigm has changed . 
  i do n't know much about how it 's done in other countries , but i understand danish and german unions tend to be a lot more constructive than the ones we have here . 
  we need strong unions , europe-wide . 
  but we need unions to reform , change their ways of thinking . 
  hell , maybe we need * different * unions , ones that have n't been active since the 1920s . 
  i spent about two years working with shell worldwide . 
  shell is huge . 
  and i mean , like , holy-shit-this-company-is-bigger-than-a-number-of-sovereign-states huge . 
  the money and people that move and flow through the company are just incredible . 
  funnily enough , if shell were a nation , it would have better social security and safety nets than a lot of eu states . 
  india and qatar are in the running , but i do n't believe it . 
  everybody wants that plane , but when they get the bill , they change their minds . 
  something something banned from / r/pyongyang . 
  seriously though , not saying there 's a clear winner , but the kims would give niyazov a run for his money . 
  `` i see your neutrality monument and raise you a ryugyong hotel ! '', 
  what ? 
  no rove for dear reader and marsharr kim jong-un ? 
  so ronery ... 
  we should impose the moral stance that `` you do what the law says , or you 'll feel the kiss of its iron spiked dildo '' . 
  they 're still there . 
  to be honest , that 's 100 % for show . 
  their famas are unloaded , only the squad leader carries loaded mags and they 're in a sealed pocket that he had to rip open to distribute the mags . 
  makes sense , you would n't want a bunch of squaddies shooting up a crowd at the first sign of problems . 
  still , a few months ago , another islamic fanatic was able to stab a patrolling soldier in the la d\u00e9fense station and run away before his squadmates were able to load up their guns . 
  still , there is a bunch of security in these places . 
  the real surveillance is the one you do n't see . 
  russian nationalist hardliners are scary people . 
  you have police surveillance everywhere outside . 
  a whackjob * could * walk in the louvre courtyard or under the eiffel tower and blow himself up with a tnt belt , but that would n't do `` much '' more than kill or injure a few dozen people . 
  ( not saying death is negligible , but you know what i mean ) the louvre also has airport-style security checkpoints if you want to get in . 
  if you hope to do serious damage , though , you need to stake the place out , gather materials , make a chemical explosive , find the know-how , stash the completed explosive device somewhere without bringing attention to yourself , maybe over a few weeks ... all these things are highly visible to a counter-terrorism unit . 
  so yeah , it would n't be realistic , i think . 
  you joke , but that 's kind of what happened . 
  france needs cash , needs it badly and needs it now . 
  i do n't know if you noticed , but our current short-term cash situation is , well , crap . 
  the need for a quick cash line was more important than anything else . 
  if we needed to share secrets to get a couple of billion euros in , they thought , let 's do it . 
  i assume there is also the expectation that military research in france can stay ahead of the russian military-industrial complex and develop new weapon systems and equipment that would be desirable , even though they 're more expensive . 
  my bigger issue with the sale is the message it sends to russia . 
  basically , we 're telling them `` hey , we know we 're in the middle of a diplomatic crisis with you guys and we 're not supposed to sell you sensitive stuff , but we 're * really poor * , you know ? '', 
  seems like a show of weakness to me . 
  well , that 's complete speculation on my part . 
  i 'm no military expert , just a guy on the internet . 
  i think there 's no way the attacks on the louvre , much less the eiffel tower , are credible . 
  there 's no way a stakeout of those places would escape the heavy police surveilance they 're under 24/7 . 
  rather frighteningly , nuclear power plants are less protected , but they 're built to withstand much worse than a car bomb . 
  unless the terrorist could get the security clearance necessary to walk into the chamber and throw a grenade at the fuel rods ... and even then , i 'm no physicist , so i do n't know what the effect would be . 
  in any case , that would also be a pipe dream . 
  targeting markets , nightclubs , and the avignon festival is a much more realistic plan . 
  as always , targeting the poorest and innocents is the islamist 's favored tactic . 
  wait 'till we sell russians our rafale fighters . 
  wait , selling rafales ? 
  who am i kidding , that 's never going to happen anywhere . 
  take a look at the rectification farther down in the article :  reader gavind says the translation is inaccurate :  * the translation here is not great , which created part of the problem . 
  the 100 % figure actually refers to assault rapes ( ie where someone is attacked and then raped ) . 
  there were 86 of those over the last five years . 
  there were 189 rapes last year in norway . 
  looking at the original report on this , 65 % of these were ( suspected ) by foreigners ( although in norway this can mean second generation in their statistics ) and the only breakdown i could find of the foreigners stated that 20 % were african , 15 % middle eastern and 14.5 % asian ( 15 % european ?? ) . 
  the victims were 70 % locals - 30 % not . 
  *  * these figures are for last year only , but match data from a previous study closely enough to suggest a consistent trend . 
  so delete 100 % and say two-thirds . 
  also worth noting that this means the majority of rapes are committed by norwegians as the largest represented group.this is not a new issue in norway . 
  as far back as 2001 there have been reports showing similar percentages * does n't change the importance of culture clash and attitudes towards women when exploring sexual violence , but - the figure is inaccurate and the title needlessly inflammatory . 
  let 's discuss this with a cool head , people . 
  hello glorious nation mother kazakhstan !, 
  i come for to make tourism , yes ? 
  where buy banana hammock , jew egg omlet and pamela anderson video ? 
  `` i am 27 years old , and i am 27 years martyrdom-free , but the temptation ... man , the temptation ... '', 
  colorful football shoes are a homosexual abomination , but half-naked brazilian dancers with neon yellow feathers up their asses during the carnival are totally ok 'cause they 're good an ' straight . 
  i can only hope it 's comfortable all the way in that closet of yours , father . 
  who knows , maybe they 'll think those were ancient gods and start worshipping sonic of the hedge and vladimir , he who controls elections . 
  when civilization collapses and a new empire rises from the wastelands , fallout-style , and they find astronomical records from our time , that 's bound to keep them confused for a long time . 
  transnistria 's a scary place . 
  not because it 's horribly repressive ( at a glance , it looks like it 's not , the last elections there seemed to be free ) , but because of the idea that a region can delude itself into declaring independence without any support except russia and living in isolation for a couple of decades ... 
  well , parisians are expert at looking down upon every area that is n't paris ... 
  but nationally , the best candidates would be : ** marseille ** . 
  deserved or not , it has the reputation of being the gangster capital of france , with a bunch of homicides in the streets , heroic quantities of drugs and weapons being shuffled through the area , and the [ cagoles marseillaises ] ( http://kabukime.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dsc02036.jpg ) ... ** corsica ** : same as marseille , but without the cagoles [ ( here 's another pic just for you !, 
  ) ] ( http://static1.puretrend.com/articles/4/44/67/4/@/400610-la-cagole-de-la-semaine-une-anonyme-637x0-3.jpg ) and more separatist terrorist networks . 
  ** the north ** , meaning the areas close to the belgian and luxembourger borders , the cities of calais , lille , valenciennes and dunkerque . 
  used to be a thriving heavy industry area because of coal mining/steelmaking , it 's now seen as a land of unemployment , alcoholism , and pedophilia . 
  for the germans out here : i understand that the working relationships in germany between unions and bosses are geared towards consensus-building and negotiation ( unlike out here ... : / ) . 
  so my question is : is that minimum wage going to change anything ? 
  have there been brokered deals depending on the industries between workers ' unions and bosses ' groups ? 
  holy shit . 
  i knew there was a good reason why i refused to read solzhenitsyn 's stuff .
