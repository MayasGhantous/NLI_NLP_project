  inflation is a price mechanic , not a currency mechanic . 
  prices can increase without currency value falling , even though it 's a common cause ( see : zimbabwe ), 
  you 're putting words in my mouth , accusing me of being something i 'm not really , and being mighty aggressive while you 're at it . 
  let me explain . 
  i am not against the minimum wage . 
  i am not against a higher minimum wage than the current level . 
  i do not believe it should be set at a higher level than this right off the bat . 
  the increase should be organic , following inflation , ensuring purchasing power remains at least constant with yearly ( or more , or less , depending on the economic situation ) increases . 
  if the wages were to be increased all of a sudden one day , it would have two effects . 
  the first is to eat into companies ' profits . 
  let 's say the minimum wage is raised all of a sudden from $ 290 to $ 600 . 
  a company employes 20 minimum-wage workers at $ 290 . 
  not only to they have to raise those 20 people 's salaries to $ 600 , but also the salaries of every person on their payroll that makes less than $ 600 . 
  that could be half the company , for all i know . 
  you 'll say , most companies can afford it . 
  that depends on the company , but for the sake of argument , let 's say it 's true . 
  a company 's goal is still to maximise profits , and seeing such a drop in profit alongside such a rise in disposable income from their consumers , they will raise prices accordingly . 
  purchasing power will drop overnight to pre-increase levels or close . 
  the same happens with self-employed people ( say , shopkeepers ) who are n't salaried but dependent on what they sell . 
  if they did n't raise their prices , they would find themselves hugely behind in terms of revenue . 
  their prices will follow the income just as quickly . 
  there is also the risk of what is called `` demand pull inflation '' . 
  if prices fail to rise as quickly as the salaries , the increased disposable income will cause consumers to rush for suddenly-affordable products . 
  if supply ca n't keep up with demand , bammo !, 
  which leads to wage inflation , another potential harmful effect . 
  conversely , if you keep the minimum wage to a slow increase , making sure purchasing power at least stays the same or ideally increases slowly , you can control for runaway effects on the economy . 
  i am 100 % for brokered minimum wages per sector , first because they are brokered , meaning both sides push and pull until a middle-of-the-road solution is found , second because they do not affect all workers in a country . 
  ** i am not an economist ** , but would n't it be in relative terms , rather than in absolute terms ? 
  meaning even with a small increase , such as 50 $ / month , it would still be roughly 20 % increase , and could already upset the balance . 
  because artificially increasing salaries would reduce ( in comparison ) the value of prices , sending them into a rise that may or may not be controlled . 
  and hyperfast inflation is never a good thing , especially when a country ( like lithuania will ) has no control over its monetary policy . 
  unless that minimum wage is actually lower in real terms ( purchasing power parity ) than it is today , it should n't be increased yet . 
  increasing the minimum wage faster than the economy grows is a recipe for disaster . 
  i only hope that accessing the euro will boost trade with eu partners and kickstart the economy . 
  read through the other thread on the subject , if you have n't before . 
  lots of good arguments pro and con there . 
  i 'd link you but i 'm on mobile . 
  actually , it could well be . 
  i 'd say it 's a latvian takeover and not an austrian one . 
  after all , ireland has many potato , no ? 
  it took five hours for someone to get that reference ? 
  geez , i am a nerd ... 
  that 's one . 
  the mandarom is another , and the quan yin method was started by a french-vietnamese woman . 
   it may be only a matter of time before they start arresting people at protests for covering their faces it 's happened already . 
  the stated purpose of the ban is to have a way of identifying people during protests and riots . 
  wear a balaclava or a scarf over your face while in a riot , and it wo n't matter if you yourself are doing any rioting , you 're in trouble if the cops get a hold of you . 
  yeah , but it 's recognized by the church , so it 's a bit more `` legitimate '' than your usual jesus-just-came-on-my-face nutcase ... ( no , i 'm not supporting the church 's activities in lourdes through the use of the word `` legitimate '' , do n't go all / r/atheism on me . ), 
  we do n't actually have christian nutjobs that speak to the virgin mary or god ... at least , that i know of . 
  maybe other french people would be happy to correct me . 
  we have , however , a good number of new age , ley line-worshippin ' , tree-huggin ' , free-shaggin ' wackos , with a bunch of them coming out of the woodwork in 2012 . 
  we also have a couple of very funny cults . 
  i 'm surprised . 
  i really am , i 100 % expected the echr to strike the ban down ( erm ... if it does have that power , that is ) . 
  tbh , i do n't know how i feel about it . 
  on the one hand , it is important that you are identifiable in public spaces . 
  recently , a couple of policemen got into a brawl with a muslim man ( emphasis on * man * ) who tried to stop them from doing an id check on his wife because that would force her to take off her veil . 
  he got arrested , and his arrest led to minor riots against the police station . 
  on the other hand , the woman in the case says wearing a niqab is her own choice , that she accepts identity checks and takes off her veil when asked , and if she does her freedom of religion should be observed . 
  it 's the scumfuckers like the man i mentioned above that need to stop . 
  on the gripping hand , it 's all about the message . 
  the only community to wear face-covering gear outside of balaclava-wearing rioters are muslim women . 
  instead of a law that ultimately uses different language to target a muslim custom , i would have preferred a strengthening or extension of the ban on `` obvious religious signs '' that we already have . 
  it would have done the job ( and a necessary job at that ) without being pointed as someone in particular . 
  as you say , most standup , army-against-army battles were meatgrinders like napoleon 's battles . 
  except is was the first large land war where both sides had rifled muskets , with a longer range and better aim . 
  plus no trenches to hide in ... 
  the issue with a three-option referendum is that you would have people who dislike the status quo but ca n't make up their minds between autonomy and independence , leading to a potentially minority opinion ( status quo ) winning the referendum . 
  the better solution would be a first yes/no solution ( should turkish kurdistan remain as it is ? ), 
  and if the `` no '' wins , hold another ( autonomy or independence ? ), 
  if nation autonomy is the price of true comradery , i 'll be the first to burn my constitution and get my people 's republic of europe citizenship . 
  the same thing happened , for roughly the same reasons , in the american civil war : technology advanced more quickly than tactics . 
  i remember hearing that the civil war was the deadliest war ever , in terms of % of the soldiers who died . 
  ww1 was the worst war ever in terms of the raw brutality and horror for the same reasons . 
  - p\u00e9taouchnok -- not a real place . 
  - tataouine-les-bains -- that 's actually a real place , a town in tunisia , the expression dates back from when tunisia was a french colony and the town of tataouine was `` the other end of france '' . 
  the `` les bains '' suffix indicates a town with thermal springs . 
  ** fun fact ** : star wars iv had desert scenes filmed in tunisia , and the desert planet of tatooine is named after tataouine . 
  - trifouillis-les-oies -- not a real city either . 
  i would get the hell out too . 
  not because i disagree with le pen 's policies ( i do , but i would n't leave for political reasons ) but because her economic policies would drive france into the ground so fucking hard you 'd have a french diaspora of people desperate to find work abroad anyway . 
  i 'd get out immediately and try to beat my competitors to the punch !, 
  back when i lived in aberdeen , i 'd go see france v scotland games at murrayfield stadium in edinburgh . 
  scottish fans would turn up with t-shirts that read `` i root for two teams : scotland and whichever team plays against england '' . 
  god - it 's bad enough when they mutilate their kids in their own countries , lack of access to education and social pressure can explain ( but not excuse ) it ... 
  but there is no human reason , excuse , or explanation for people living in europe to go through that procedure . 
  i hope these people are convicted of torture . 
  does that apply only to danish citizens , or do foreign nationals who immigrate to denmark after having done the procedure elsewhere also face legal action ? 
  i think that 's what / u/spanishninjutsu meant , that the system is profitable for a few organisations that lobby the capitol to keep that system going . 
  although , if you want to stop whoring , the army 's not the best place to go ... 
  not only that , but it 's also badly adapted to a globalised economy . 
  it is possible for the state to offer maximum protection when tax revenue give it the means to implement its policy . 
  but for tax revenue to flow in , the people must have revenue to pay tax on ( i 'm only referring to income tax here , but it would apply to others too ) . 
  to have revenue they must have jobs . 
  and i do n't think the economic policy put forward by france ( and a few other eu countries , no doubt ) is conducive to job creation in a global economy . 
  what avantages do you have to compete against growing countries like india , brazil , china , or nigeria ? 
  ( also , yes , i 'm aware of the cost of tax fraud . 
  it definitely is something that should be dealt with , with zero tolerance on fraudsters , but it would not solve the problem 100 % ), 
  i 'm pretty much anti-welfare-state myself , and i would see a social contract where the terms would be `` the citizens and businesses contribute to the state through taxes , voting and participation . 
  in return , the state regulates the private sector to protects against blatant abuses and allows the private sector free reign on everything except [ x things ] '' the x things would be different stuff depending on who you ask .
