  in my view , it should be healthcare , primary and secondary education , police/justice and defense , full stop . 
  to be honest , i think the view i just stated is the closest to neoliberal you will find in europe , outside of select economic circles like the city of london . 
  maybe europe is shifting to the economically liberal side , but it 'll never be the us . 
  at least , i think . 
   ( 2 ) do n't throw it in a lake . ), 
  given the behavior of the average finnish person , this is actually worthwhile advice . 
  mandatory military service in france was abolished in the late 90s . 
  i never had to go through it . 
  i was happy to skip it at the time , but now i think it would have been a beneficial experience and i 'm a bit sorry that i never served . 
  i was a pretty sheltered , upper-class kid , typical of the millenial generation 's cliches , and i would have benefited from getting my ass thoroughly kicked for a year . 
  i think it would have made the transition from school to working life easier , i would have gotten my head around the fact that no , i 'm not the most important person in the room anymore . 
  it 's a fact that 's been tough to learn in my first adult years : /, 
  so he says these guys are just homebrew resistance , without any material support from russia . 
  let 's say that 's true . 
  does it change anything ? 
   it 's still interesting that with islam-related questions you 'll find a reasonable amount of people leaning to the `` fanatics are a minority , most muslims are decent people , all those i personally know are ok '' . 
  about the roma that does n't happen . 
  because very few people actually know decent roma . 
  hell , very few people know any roma at all . 
  muslims share the sedentary lifestyle of the majority populations and can live alongside them , while the roma ( because of discrimination , culture , tradition , language and a whole other lot of factors ) are still partly nomadic and separate themselves from the community . 
  yes and no . 
  roma communities nowadays mostly are n't nomadic by choice , they 're nomadic because nobody wants them in their backyard and they get kicked out every few weeks . 
  when a roma band finds some place they can settle in long-term , like some abandoned football pitch or whatever , they do . 
  also , as / u/quoar said , it was n't even `` beating the shit out of the burglar '' ( which i 'd want to do too ) . 
  these guys walked into the camp like it ai n't no thang , took the kid away and brought him to a basement to be beaten up . 
  that 's not a mob incident . 
  we 've had mobs fighting against roma bands in marseille , and it usually ends with someone threatening to torch the whole camp , not just beating up one guy . 
  this is way too calculated to be an angry reaction ... 
  how else do you think the nsa was so efficient for so long ? 
  a little bit o ' romanian 21st-century , high-tech god-powered network access !, 
  it also tells a lot about france unfortunately . 
  the only reason we 're going forward with the deal is because we 're so strapped for cash we need all the revenue sources we can get . 
  that sends a clear message to moscow : * `` france is so poor right now , they 're perfectly willing to sell top-of-the-line weapons to a potential enemy to get a few extra euros !, 
  i 'm only 2/3 of the way through his speech , but i 'd like to bring something up that caught my attention :  whatever the response is to the phrase , `` winter is coming '' is very much part of european society today because i do believe that the social contract underlying european society since the end of the second world war has run its course and needs fundamental renewal . 
  i can not but agree with him there . 
  i believe for a long time , the social contract in europe was `` the state will protect the individual as much as possible , and the individual in return will support the state through voting and taxes '' . 
  that clearly does n't work anymore , the governed are progressively withdrawing their consent . 
  so what new contract are we heading for ? 
  especially when they realise there are black , and brown , and yellow , and caramel , and other colors of people in europe . 
  then , they flip their shit . 
  see [ that thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/27gycu/a_picture_taken_in_france_has_black_people_in_it/ ) posted to / r/subredditdrama by our very own / u/houad . 
  look through the linked thread in the thread ( yeah , threadception ) and be amazed . 
  anonymous redditors who find it easy to be assholes behind a username . 
  seriously though , it 's racists of every stripe . 
  most of the anti-american comments come from american redditors for whom europe is the land of refinement and lack of n #ggers . 
  a lot of comments that wind up on / r/shitredditsays or / r/circlebroke come from / r/worldnews . 
  i do n't like the srs or circlebroke mindset , but the comments they link to from / r/worldnews are pretty terrible . 
  french police are now insinuating that the `` vigilantes '' could be gang members . 
  that would explain the cold-blooded nature of the beating . 
  and if the locals were gang members or drug dealers , we 're looking at something potentially worse than `` petty theft '' , maybe a turf war ? 
  anyway , this is pure speculation , and in no way excuses the act . 
  hope this kid pulls through . 
   the article seems to hint that the perpetrators may have been gangsters themselves . 
  yeah , i have trouble imagining that normal people , no matter how racist , would so something so premeditated as picking the kid up , beating him half to death and leaving him in a shopping trolley . 
  feels like a gang action to me . 
  i do n't know , maybe i 'm just too optimistic about people, 
  if you attempt that switch once that article is crossposted to / r/worldnews , you 'll get blank stares and people asking '' ... what 's wrong with killing a jew ? '', 
  that explains so much ... and here i thought it was just inbreeding !, 
  on behalf of france , i 'd like to apologize for the project management on this one . 
  i used to do that , but i was 15 . 
  are they 15 ? 
  the fact that so many people are in favor of near-complete closure of the borders to foreign business in order to save a few industrial jobs . 
  i mean , i get it , it 's great you 're a leftist and you want to help the working class , but you do n't do that by getting the government to intervene with threats of nationalization every time a company wants to invest or divest in the country . 
  that 's not good business conduct and it will hurt way too much in the long run . 
  also , the way our media is so tightly linked to our political class , left or right . 
  he was somewhat like a persistent std , was n't he ? 
  everytime you thought he 'd gone for good , he came back to make you itch !, 
  beyond the fast food restaurants , a lot of bistros and steak houses have their hamburgers , way better than the mcdonald 's versions . 
  some of them are given a local twist , like the savoyard burger with reblochon cheese , or the burger with foie gras , or the tartar steak burger with raw meat . 
  we also have food trucks very similar to the american ones , with the same kind of food . 
  oh , and if you order your burger in a sit-down place like a steak house , it 's good form to eat it with a knife and fork . 
  they could , though . 
  capitalism reduces life to numbers , communism reduces life . 
  seems like communism wins when it comes to efficiency . 
   and yes , as sorry as i am for them , i prefer to get in a car that 's not driven by a sweaty 40-50 year-old who wants to make conversation with me . 
  ... and , if you 're in paris , will refuse to take you anywhere because it 's inconvenient for him . 
   we keep the oil as it 's in our borders . 
  do n't tell me westminster * agreed * to that in advance ? 
  i foresee a bit of a scuffle if independence goes through . 
  the country 's pretty much ironclad safe then . 
  i hate public screenings , so it 'll be at home or maybe in a bar for me . 
  i bet that france would be eliminated in quarter-finals , because at least the asshole players that were fucking up our team effort are gone , so we 'll make it out of the groups this time . 
  for some reason that stuff was really popular in the 2000s ... 
  it 's over nw , but the hipster stuff we 've egot now is n't much better ... 
  eurotrash was the shit . 
  they had antoine de caunes onboard when he was still awesome . 
  i see your aliz\u00e9e and raise you [ ilona mitrecey - un monde parfait ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8p0bxmykqg ), 
  the qatari embassy in paris has a giant piece of concrete candy painted like the qatar flag in the garden . 
  that 's not really fortress-like . 
  ... [ no , really ] ( http://02.wir.skyrock.net/wir/v1/resize/?c=isi&amp;im=%2f0601%2f83020601%2fpics%2f3101955581_1_3_9tyslqid.jpg&amp;w=760 ) .

  you can just feel them going '' ... eh , fuck it , this is paris , who 's going to hurt us here ? 
  get a nice house with a garden , yeah ? '', 
  well , i did n't expect that name to come up in this thread ... 
  here are my answers using that test : your answers were : the government should not censor any opinion in any case . 
  government and church must be separate , but the government may finance some of the social tasks undertaken by the church ( schools , asylums ... ) military service shall be voluntary . 
  that is the best way to have a professional amry prepared to defend our interests and commitments abroad . 
  laws should not interfere with sex between consenting adults , in no case . 
  the use of some drug currently forbidden shall be legal , although its distribution should be controlled . 
  the laws and the judiciary should establish in which cases preventive measures go before certain individual rights .
