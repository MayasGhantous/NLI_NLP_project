  that being said , you may encouter unshaved pussies . 
  but i guess it does n't have to be true to be a stereotype . 
  it 's kind of easy to live despite that . 
  lpt : if you do n't like garlic , just replace it with cheese in every recipe you know . 
  works just fine !, 
  lpt2 : if you feel like the huge amount of cheese is giving you bad breath , cover it up with red wine . 
  bonus point : it works too if it 's garlic that 's giving you bad breath !, 
  lpt3 : when you 're drunk due to all the wine you drank , just lit a cigarette to put on a bold front . 
  everyone will then appear to be extremely beautiful . 
   you do love the garlic though personnally , i ** hate ** it . 
  which makes me avoid `` traditionnal '' food . 
  of course , this does n't change the fact that most french will use garlic when cooking . 
  it appears foreigners have a lot of stereotypes about my country . 
  thoses stereotypes include ( but are not limitated to ) : - we eat cheese a lot - we surrender a lot - everyone smoke - we drink red wine - we wear berets - we carry baguettes anywhere we go - we are rude , self-righteous and pretentious - we ca n't / do n't want to speak english - every woman is gorgeous and classy - 99 % of men have a mustache - 99 % of our meals include garlic - we 're romantic - paris ( and parisians ) is representative of france of course , ~ ~ most ~ ~ all of these are just clich\u00e9s . 
  almost every type of kinder available . 
  with a strong preference for kinder bueno . 
  also , snicker bars, 
   fiat makes the worst cars in europe clearly you have n't heard of french cars . 
  i suggest you watch the [ bbc documentary ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2if9gy ) about peugeots . 
  and i can concur . 
  i 'm french and while some of our cars are good , some others are really bad . 
  like the peugeot 106 ( cheap but does n't like to stay on the road ) or the renault clio i ( engine does n't like to run when turn the key ) . 
  and sorry but i have to disagree about fiat , a '90 fiat panda 1000 is probably one of the best cars ever made . 
  designed by giugaro , cheap to run , allows you to * not loose * your license for speeding ... 
  well , they do know that french is hard , so they tried to make an english version of legifrance . 
  but we have so much laws ( this ** not ** bragging , having so much laws is a problem ) and they change so much that they do n't have the ressources to actualize it . 
  here 's [ l\u00e9gifrance english version ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/traductions/en-english ) , a spanish version exists too . 
  of course , the cmf is n't updated . 
  but most articles did n't change that much ( banking laws in france are add-ons of the 1984 law ) , so this might help you understand . 
  and no worries for helping , it 's not like i talk about banking laws everyday !, 
  in french law , it 's complicated . 
  i 'll try to summerize ( with my french high school level in english ) : - a credit establishment in france ( art . 
  l511-1 du code mon\u00e9taire et financier ; last modification , may 23rd 2015 ) is an establishment that * regularly and for profit * , * keeps money for random people * ( see art . 
  l312-2 du code mon\u00e9taire et financier ) , or * gives loans to random people * ( see art . 
  the random people part is important , you 're not a credit establishment if you give money to your family or friends ( i suppose there are similar laws in other countries ) . 
  - so basically , 3 things can make you a credit establishment : you give or keep money for people ; you do this on a regular basis ; you do this in order to get money ( you do n't do it for free ) . 
  in french law , habit and profit are usually what makes something a profession . 
  - all banks are credit establishment . 
  but not all credit establishments are banks ( there are 4 others kind of credit establishments , besides banks ) . 
  - so if it 's a bank , it 's a credit establishment . 
  - now what 's a bank according to french law ? 
  a bank is an establishment that keeps people 's money , does credit operations and offers its clients payment services . 
  - so while most banks would all these 3 things , you can be a bank if you only do one ( or two ) of these . 
  the criteria are n't cumulatives .

  you 're welcome !, 
  i 'm mostly working on insurances ( in france , banks can sell insurances , and most loans have to be insured , i do n't know if it 's the case in other countries ) ; payment devices ; and basically what a french bank can sell to a consumer , and what they ca n't do . 
  i do n't know exactly what 's the deal in europe since i look at the french transposition of directives . 
  i can only find references . 
  but feel free to ask . 
  and good luck for your thesis , i know just how hard it can be !, 
  hi , i 'm working on french banking ( and insurance ) law . 
  it 's mostly transpositions of european directives . 
  here 's what i have , but the references are for french users . 
  let me know if you ca n't find it . 
  - directive 2014/17/ue , on real estate loans . 
  i 'm sorry everything is in french , but i search everything on * legifrance * which is the french site for every law ( national or european ) that applies in france . 
  hope this helps you, 
  i ca n't predict my country 's future except for two things : - there will be strikes - there will be demonstrations, 
   southerners will tell you it 's the north . 
  exactly , i 'm a southerner and i 'm deeply convinced that northerners are redneckers than rednecks . 
  * les tuche * is seen as a documentary . 
  we give them wine and cheese , they give us beer . 
  i think it 's briliant because we can do this with germany * and * belgium . 
  also we can trade peugeots for porsches , but i do n't think the germans will agree to this . 
  there 's nothing wrong with it . 
  in france , some * blanquette * ( sparkling wine ) like the * blanquette de limoux * are better than a lot of 15-18 $ ( french prices ) champagnes . 
  i 'm pretty sure some bottles of asti or moscato can be as good as this . 
  hello , i 'm taking your budget in consideration . 
  of course dom p\u00e9rignon is one of the best know champagne , but it 's because they only do vintage . 
  which means there is n't dom p\u00e9rignon each year . 
  you can only have it when the year is good ( i could explain it better in french , sorry ) . 
  other famous brands make champagne each year . 
  but most of them do this as well , they call it * cuv\u00e9e mill\u00e9sim\u00e9e * ou * mill\u00e9sime * . 
  my personnal favorite is ruinart . 
  if your mother likes history , you can buy cristal roederer . 
  it 's pretty good and their bootles have a special design . 
  all champagne bottles ( except cristal roederer ) have some sort of cone inside their bottom . 
  champagne bottles have to be laid down , and turned ( by a quarter of a complete rotation ) every now and then ( i do n't know the exact time ) , so the cone allows to turn them easily . 
  since i 'm pretty shitty when it comes to explaning something in english , here 's a [ picture ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=fond+de+bouteille+de+champagne&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi8k4nwz7ptahvdkcakhdnmcaeq_auibigb&amp;biw=1339&amp;bih=794#tbm=isch&amp;q=remuage+champagne&amp;imgrc=vahkjljnw83nlm: ) of the process . 
  the cristal roederer bottle has a flat bottom . 
  the reason is funny , it was tsar alexander ii of russia 's favorite champagne . 
  but the guy was afraid someone would hide a bomb somewhere to kill him . 
  so roederer made a flat bottomed bottle to prevent anyone from hiding bombs under their bottles . 
  if you 're looking for a good champagne but not a very expensive one , i have a good tip : look at the label on the bottle . 
  you have a lot of informations , including a serial number . 
  this number consists in two letters , three numbers , and three other numbers . 
  the best * c\u00e9pages * which makes the best champagnes are marked with the letters ** nm ** so any champagne with a serial number that is nm - *** - *** is a very good champagne , no matter the price . 
  for example , look at the bottom on the right of this [ picture ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=%c3%a9tiquette+champagne&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewisgbhx0lptahugosakhckcbuaq_auibigb&amp;biw=1339&amp;bih=794#imgrc=la_vufqtmuorum: ) ; you can see the serial number . 
  i hope that all i wrote up there is understandable and wish you a good time in france !, 
  to answer your question : i do n't care . 
   because if a woman claims that you are the father of her child the government can require you to support her and the child financially . 
  if you get a paternity test you can avoid that you 're mistaking . 
  here 's why : - you 're right about this part : in france , i ca n't take a paternity test just because i want to . 
  - then you 're wrong because you think our legal system is similar to yours . 
  if a woman claims i 'm her kid 's father , she 'll have to prove that ( in france , a woman ca n't write anyone 's name as the father on a birth certificate ) . 
  so if she wants to prove that i 'm the father , she will have to sue ( she 's not suing for child support , she 's suing for me being * legally * the father . 
  * then * she can sue for cs ) . 
  if she does so , ** the judge will ask for a paternity test ** ( unless there 's an exception , like i was married to the woman when the baby was born ) . 
  when a judge orders a man to take a paternity test , there are only 3 possible outcomes : he takes it , it 's negative , he 's not the father ; he takes it , it 's positive , he 's the father ; he refuses to takes it , he 's legally the father .
