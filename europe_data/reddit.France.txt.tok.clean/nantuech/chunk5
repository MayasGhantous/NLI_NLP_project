  but what 's a great modern thing we export ? 
  the packaging, 
  i 'd say cheese , but i think some could say red wine . 
  you forgot * sous le soleil * / s, 
  not really . 
  a shoulder massage is n't sexual at all . 
  physiotherapist do it very frequently , and they are n't prostitutes . 
  physical contact is n't always sex . 
  otherwise wrestling would be seen as sexual . 
  imo , the only thing that can make a massage a sexual thing is mutual attraction . 
  so basically it has nothing to do with the act , and has all to do with the people involved . 
   i wonder , have there been serious initiatives for a major spelling reform to make french phonetic ? 
  there have been , but it would n't be a good idea . 
  the spelling is actually quite important when it comes to understand something written . 
  as other frenchs have said : 0 $ . 
  i went to university ( law school until phd ) . 
  i never had to buy a book . 
  if you ever need a book for an exam , you can borrow it at the library . 
  however , some people like to buy one or two books . 
  in law school , it 's usually the * code civil * . 
  they do that so they can write on it ( obviously you 're not allowed to write on a book you 're borrowing ) . 
  the price is something like 35 $ . 
  knowing how useless it is ( i have been in law school for 10 years , and i 'm a teaching assistant ) , no student should buy one . 
  because of dumb political choices ( that happen more often than not here ) in education , children struggle a lot with * every part * of our language . 
  ( source : i teach in high school and college ) . 
  but even for `` average '' people , tenses can be hard . 
  different tenses can have the same pronounciation . 
  for instance : - * futur * and * conditionnel * i will be -  * je serai * i would be -  * je serais * the ** s ** is silent , both have the same pronounciation . 
  - * infinitif * ( infinitive form ) and * participe pass\u00e9 * ( past participle ) to go -  * aller * gone -  * all\u00e9 * both are pronounced exactly the same . 
  those are just examples . 
  as i said , france puts less and less efforts in teaching french to the young generations . 
  and it 's not like we were the brightest on earth . 
  if you come to france , try * fischer * ( from alsace ) or * pelforth * ( from north ) . 
  they 're probably not the best in the world ( even in europe ) , but they 're ok , and pelforth is realtively cheap . 
  also , if you come to visit our beautiful country , try one of southern france specialty : the [ ricard ] ( http://images.google.fr/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fpernod-ricard.fr%2ffiles%2fgamme%2fi1g1_small_11.png&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fpernod-ricard.fr%2f122%2fles-marques%2fdecouvrir-toutes-les-marques%2fmarques-strategiques%2fricard&amp;h=348&amp;w=320&amp;tbnid=me5qbph8zznplm%3a&amp;docid=tksulfjqgskhim&amp;ei=suhdv6r2j4b8um-nszao&amp;tbm=isch&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=2986&amp;page=0&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=0ahukewjqvtirvzbpahugphqkhc9tdoiqmwgzkaawaa&amp;bih=732&amp;biw=1420 ) it helps a lot when you have to get along with frenchs !, 
  you 're generous !, 
  this very morning , i was killed by some immigrant who was enforcing shakira law . 
  my family is now very poor because they did n't inheritate my belongings . 
  all went down to the state , because they are also commies . 
  it 's only fair to say that this is the case in all europe . 
  if i was able to speak german correctly , i would probably go to munich . 
  if not , i 'd live in dublin . 
   i would n't wish the french on anyone but kim jong-un that 's the best compliment we ever recieved !, 
   polite french speakers they do n't know how to speak french !, 
  source : i 'm an arrogant french speaker and ca n't understand what `` polite french speakers '' say . 
   b ______________ * martin * is the most common last name in france . 
  and i actually went to school with a guy named pierre martin . 
  ** cashback ** , from director sean ellis . 
  and most of guy ritchie 's movies . 
  clearly there are societal issues in france . 
  we 're more than 65 millions people , so i guess it 's kinda normal . 
  for sure this is n't the best country in the world , but the situation is * overall * okay . 
  you may encounter some cop going out of his way , but that 's highly unusual . 
  even with all the stuff going on at the moment , the biggest issue is still common crime ( theft , mauling , rape etc. ) . 
  as for op 's question , i think it 's very unlikely that hr would be suspended for immigrants and arabs . 
  france has had a lot of immigration in its history . 
  at the beginning of the xxth century we had a huge load of immigrants from portugal , spain , italy and poland . 
  after that , it was from africa . 
  i know very few people who do n't have at least one grandmother or grandfather who was n't french . 
  so i think that while some ignorant people ( the french equivalent of rednecks ) might blame immigration , most people know immigration is not the problem , and would n't support any suspension of hr . 
  your article about france is seriously biased . 
  it 's basically saying that since a teacher called the police because a kid refused to say `` je suis charlie '' , there is some institutionalized racism . 
  it 's completely untrue . 
  first of all , that teacher was heavily criticized by french commentators . 
  then there were n't much consequences for the kid because in france , police is n't very harsch with kids ( especially when they 're under 13 ) . 
  in the end , the teacher is just considered incredibly dumb , and nobody gives a shit about what the kid thinks ( except is dumb teacher ) . 
  as for the veil banning part , the ban is not widely supported by frenchs . 
  it 's a political `` solution '' to a citizen right issue : the incompatibility between religious freedom and the right to make your own choices . 
  the issue is complex , and the political answer might not be the best ( it would n't be surprising , our politicians are shitty as fuck ) , but it 's clearly not an attack on * human rights * . 
  the situation in france is far from perfect . 
  but every slice of the population ( young people , old people , women , men , richs , poors , every race and religion , atheists ... ) has its problems . 
  this article only focuses on some particular interests . 
  also , the battle against anti semitism and racism is one of 2016 great national causes . 
  while owning clothes for the season ( like every country that has cold winter and hot summer , we have spring/summer collection and fall/winter collection ) , we tend to adapt to the temperature . 
  i think the main difference comes from how we deal with cold or hot weather . 
  people are used to regulate their body heat according to their environment . 
  some people are used to rainy and cold weather ( presumably from lyon and north ) so they will wear t-shirts and shorts any day that 's warmer than 20c . 
  other people are used to relatively dry and hot weather , with long sunny days . 
  they will wait for the temerature to go close to 30c to wear summer clothers . 
  of course there are exceptions . 
  and it 's important to know that most people in paris are n't parisians , and that french people can move from north to south and vice versa . 
  alcohol is relatively cheap compared to the uk , especially in nightclubs . 
  it 's sunnier than the uk ( obviously ) . 
  from here you can drive to spain , portugal , switzerland , belgium , germany , italy and nederlands in more or less one day . 
  if you do n't mind rude people and strikes , you do n't have to leave the country to get to the sea , the ocean ( both decently warm in summer ) and in the moutain to go skiing . 
  also we are supposed to host a great population of hot women and to surrender at first sight of someone speaking german . 
  it should n't be too hard to find your soulmate . 
  if you 're not into women , that 's fine , we are supposedly all gay . 
  if you 're a girl , you 're screwed . 
  oh and one last thing , we happen to be sarcastic . 
  a little late , but i will answer because this is one of my favourite movies . 
  i saw it when i was a kid ( 97 or 98 ) and loved it of course . 
  then 5 or 6 years ago , i read somewhere that roland emerich ( director ) did n't intend to do a 1st degree movie , but more of a sarcastic one ( like starship troopers ) . 
  if you 're looking for irony in this movie , it will become way more interesting . 
  so yes , i like the president 's speech because it summerize all the points that emerich tried to make . 
  it 's even funnier than the clich\u00e9s of non-us armies ( in the scene where they send instructions in morse code ) . 
  it 's almost inspirationnal , because bill pullman is a great actor . 
  sure , it screams `` hey , america will save the human race , freedom and everything you 've ever dreamed of '' , and that 's the beauty of it . 
  in armaggedon for example , it 's the same thing : the world waits for the us to save them , and the us saves the day . 
  in id4 , that idea is pushed to the limit , and that makes it a great movie imo .
