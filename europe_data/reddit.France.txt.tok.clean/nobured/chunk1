[ french cook gets easily scared ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczmispjqxi ), 
  the ships are built on russian specs . 
  they will be of no use but the russians military . 
  modifying them to nato specs would cost a lot . 
   they 'd only catch eel and other baugette shaped fish . 
  you mean baguette ? 
  [ 99 francs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_francs_%28film%29 ) , [ la cit\u00e9 de la peur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_cit%c3%a9_de_la_peur ) , [ la classe am\u00e9ricaine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_classe_am%c3%a9ricaine ) , [ l'auberge espagnole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%27auberge_espagnole ) ( great franco-spanish movie , about erasmus students ) . 
  much like wallonia or detroit , the cities there are plagued with old factories decaying . 
  there 's high unemployement . 
  the weather is shitty compared to the south of france . 
  yep , but the north region still has a big stigma . 
  will downvote again . 
  ow , do n't show me cheese , i do n't live in france anymore :-d, 
  pretty much what i had in mind too . 
  i may add [ rocamadour ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/rocamadour_overview.jpg ) too . 
  and the wall street journal ... 
  because we 're really bitter . 
  at least i am . 
  the european union speaks the language of its most eurosceptic member , that chose to keep its old money . 
  not that i would be happy that french or german was the de facto european language . 
  something like esperanto would have been more fitting for us . 
  edit : i 'm not that bitter , just a bit sad , and i am in no way hating on british or americans . 
  and the scenarios . 
  thanks , that 's true for canada too . 
  i can explain for canada , i think it 's the same for the us : your employer decides how much of your salary goes to taxes . 
  if your employer paid a bit too much in taxes ( and after taking into account all your deductibles , like charity ) you get money back . 
  if your employer did not pay enough , you 'll have to pay . 
  generally you pay a accountant to fill your taxes . 
  you give him the documents showing how much you got paid that your employer gave you and other documents about your other financial gains , or tax-deductible expenses ( charity , medical and education expenses , etc. ) . 
  he fills the paperwork and tells you how much you can expect to get back/pay . 
  sure , but i do n't see french newspapers bashing uk at every opportunity . 
  op provided it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22p65k/homicide_rates_at_the_subnational_level_europe/cgoztgr ) . 
  page 29 . 
  hopefully i 'm in qu\u00e9bec , where people are a bit more `` latin '' i guess . 
  even small restaurants wo n't stop serving before 8h30 on slow days . 
  i just wonder why british newspaper have so much hate on france . 
  it 's always `` france is bad , look at this new law '' , `` france is going down , look at these numbers '' , `` france is shit , we do n't really know why but let us explain with numerous anecdotes '' . 
  what 's the problem , are they angry because francis bacon ? 
  that 's for uk . 
  in canada ( and the us i guess ) it 's common to eat dinner between 5-6 :30 pm . 
  it 's homicides per 100,000 inhabitants . 
  why not napol\u00e9on ? 
  well the arrest did happen , it was [ filmed ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x175skg_exclusif-paris-france-13-11-2013-interpellation-de-david-van-hemelryck-leader-de-hollande-demission_news#from=embediframe ) . 
  i find it really funny that he 's followed by a news motorcycle the day he 's arrested . 
  it 's also not said on what grounds he was arrested , you only get to hear what he had to say . 
  what do you mean by `` protestant work ethic '' ? 
  i feel like i 'm missing something . 
  edit : thanks to everyone who answered my question . 
  / r/takeonestepforward, 
  the pictures were taken on the 14th , so circulation was closed due to the parade . 
  he who controls the pussy , controls the universe !, 
  [ artist is from finland , videoclip is french ] ( http://vimeo.com/11986796 ), 
  well everyone knows france is bacon . 
  what part is it ? 
  is it this one ? 
   because one of the effects of having such an ideas-based vision of society , and elevating ideas to such heights , is that people actually start believing in them , and then maybe they start thinking the ideas are worth fighting for , or perhaps dying for , or perhaps even killing for . 
  and then what ? 
  well we 're trying ... ca n't blame the governement for that . 
  first part :  lufthansa just announced it would apply small varnish patches simulating shark skin on two airbus a-340 300 in order to reduce fuel comsuption . 
  i 'm not sure about some of the words . 
  for cheaper you can say `` moins cher '' meaning `` less costly '' or `` less expensive '' . 
  if you really want to use march\u00e9 it would be that way : les choses sont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral _ meilleur _ march\u00e9 aux usa qu'en europe . 
  but i do n't think i 'm a good teacher . 
  visit / r/french for a better support , 
  i think he means french can give you a lot of nuances in meaning compared to english . 
  maybe it 's a cultural bias ( you have more vocabulary and understanding of your native language than a foreign one ) . 
  not sure if serious, 
  i like you . 
  as far as i remember , the critics were majorly the ump , some industry bosses , and the right-leaning media . 
  yes , we need time to protest . 
  more seriously , norway workers works even less than french ones , yes they have a very sharp productivity advantage . 
  maybe there 's something to learn about that . 
  [ l'internationale ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epgro-tiegm ) , may be french but have been translated to most european languages . 
  how did you call my mom ? 
  no , i meant `` i do n't mind too '' !, 
  i usually do too . 
  they do are europeans . 
  but if you can read french speaking swiss newssites ( like http://www.20min.ch/ro/news/suisse/story/10553175 ) , you 'll see that the comments are mostly about french people living close to the swiss border and crossing the frontier to steal swiss jobs . 
  swiss people do n't seem very friendly to french people . 
  but switzerland is not part of the european union . 
  well i certainly did not know that . 
  thanks . 
  merci . 
  damnit , they were so close to a resolution !, 
  i thougth the longest word was \u00e9lastique :3 i 'll see myself out . 
  my father also had to stop in riga on his way to moscow and loved it !, 
  tulips ? 
  what 's disgusting about racism ? 
  so i 'm not the only one looking at / r/worldnews top comments and leaving disgusted .

  / r/peta is leaking . 
  you just have to look at your northern neighbor . 
  they have that too . 
  i do n't know who you met , but i met of people not obsessed with money , whose goal was to teach , study , follow a goal other than the big bucks . 
  [ bourges ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bourges ) is a very old man . 
  he have tons of stories to tell , how he was friend to some ancient hero , but got beaten badly while defending him . 
  he still have some scars from that fight . 
  he also loves to tell about how , in his thirties , he was a seducer and had a great wealth . 
  he still have a beautiful watch from that time . 
  he 's still the boss of a small company , but his neighbours are taking away all his business .
