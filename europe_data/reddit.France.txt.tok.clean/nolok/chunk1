i would have admired the decision even more if they followed through and actually invaded in ' 39 , instead of letting poland be dismembered fyi there was a very well sourced thread on askhistorians about that one . 
  france was n't ready when they declared war , but they had a plan ready with the poles : roughly put , the poles were to slow the german down and move toward their eastern border ( keeping their army able to put a fight to force germany to stay there ) and after readying up france was to push into germany - still not ready to fight them head on , but banking on the two fronts advantage and forcing the germans on the defensive westward . 
  a lot of german industry was on their western part and they planned to take it quickly before germany could re-mobilize properly . 
  what happened is that once the poles got east , the soviets came in against them . 
  they were trapped and folded quickly . 
  war would n't be two fronts anymore , germany had no threat east , and france was not able to take them head on , so they abandoned the offensive plans and prepared for defense , the rest is history . 
  they could call it a curtain . 
  and if they use iron for the wire , they could even call it an iron curtain !, 
  that sounds like such a good plan , it will totally make the people blockaded believe that those building the separation have their best interest at heart, 
  they 're illegal in france and belgium as well, 
   3 largest net contributors to eu budget in absolute terms : germany , france , italy  3 largest net contributors to eu budget in per capita terms : denmark , finland , germany  3 largest net contributors to eu budget as a proportion of gdp : denmark , italy , germany it 's net contribution , what they pay minus what they receive back . 
  i do n't see any of the core provider nations being pushed to the door . 
   every moroccan i 've known adores their king , everything that seems so silly to me is just normal for them . 
  yeah but they agree theirs is a king . 
  turkish people still say they have a democratically fairly elected prime minister / president , not a king , and such it is surprising that it is possible for him to do that . 
  to give you an example of why/how it can still displace the environment : virtually all bananas sold in markets all over the world ( the large yellow ones ) for the past few decades are `` clones '' , who did not reproduce and would not produce the same thing if reproducing . 
  they still replaced almost all bananas existing or reduced them to virtual non existence . 
  if a gm crop for say , wheat , end up being vastly superior to other crops of wheat , the same could happen . 
  and when you look at the current situation for bananas , it shows how it can be terrible ( they are currently being wiped out by a virus , and because they 're all clones , none of them have natural immunity ) . 
  in case of bananas the `` damage '' was limited to other bananas species but since in addition to being a superior product gm crop tends to fight against their threats ( insects , weeds , ... ) it could affect a lot more . 
   any incentive they have to design their crops to be as resilient not really , the whole point of those crops is to be as resilient as possible ( most gm crops do not produce more or better product , but resist to heavier pesticide and/or fight and defend against their predators ) i think we agree overall by the way , in that gm are not bad per see but we need a good solution and products that allow gm but limiting and reducing the negative effects . 
  it will be hard though because most people and country tend to pick one side and stick to its extreme . 
  i only started to answer because people usually go the way of `` anti gm people are dumb '' , and the first answer to your message followed that, 
   we ca n't possibly know if a gm crop wo n't unleash the plant equivalent of the zombie apocalypse i 'm not talking about that kind of `` apocalypse '' , but simple ecological replacement through evolutive superiority ( what the gm crops are meant to do ) . 
  plants that are stronger , cheaper to maintain , and protected against predator ** will ** take over their area . 
  it already happens with animals , insects , mosquitos , etc ... when they get introduced into an environment where they thrive . 
  part of that is the pac , which france considers super important for independence/not relying on someone else for critical thing in case of it . 
  although i agree with the pac despite how controversial it is in the eu , it also directly means making more food when we have enough for us would be stupid , since its made at economically profitable cost . 
  especially since a large part of our food production in france and poland ( the two `` bread basket '' of the eu ) is dependent on the pac , aka we subsidize it . 
  i know the pac is controversial in several other eu countries , myself i 'm for the pac and that was one of the condition from france for to go forward with the eu , as it 's meant to maintain our food independence . 
  but it also means it makes no sense to increase it for economical purpose , we already ca n't sell what we have . 
  the rest of the world has a lot of non exploited arable land , but somehow rich europe should pay it 's farmer so that we can have food to give for free or below cost . 
  in theory it 's great and i agree with your point of view , but the issue is tad bit more complicated than that . 
  there are problems with the spreading of those crops ( since they are `` stronger '' to survive in the environment , when their seed reach other fields they survive better than `` natural '' seed and take over ) , which causes issue both ecologically , in terms of diversity and legally ( this is what has happened in countries where those crops have been allowed , and for the legal parts it 's where monsanto claim your field which got gm seeds from another now require you to pay them ) . 
  it also hurts the fauna and flora around it and seeing how long it took us to admit than one ( 1 ) pesticide we put everywhere might very well be what kills the insects and bees around us , i 'm not a huge fan of spending another couple of decades killing everything we rely on because interests stop us from admitting the problem and finding solutions for them . 
  simply put , these are crops that are meant to be stronger and spread better than non modified crops , and to resist to animals that feeds off it , and that 's exactly what they do . 
  but when one says that ; a lot of pro gm people start claiming it 's fear mongering , which is really stupid : if they work then they ** must ** have an ecological effect on their environment and take over , because that 's what they 're engineered to do . 
  if one does n't then it 's a useless gm crop . 
  i 'm not that much anti-gm per see and have no problem buying gm food if they were for sale in my country , but let 's not make it sound like the issue is purely a `` stupid moral people '' ( see savannajeff comment to your message to see what i mean ) . 
  the people doing the striking ( and the ones merkel aims at with this proposition ) are the ones that have way more power than others because their strike block critical parts of the infrastructure . 
  and if you 're wondering `` how is that any better than several unions '' , it 's because several unions all have slightly different requests and you can never find a solution where anyone is satisfied . 
  we have the same issue in france . 
  or one union strike , they get a deal , then another strike to get their own , then ... 
  it 's pretty much killing air france the past few years . 
  the important point is how the `` mother union '' is constituted , i guess in austria they do it the right way and each union get a proportional amount of seats depending of their own size , or something similar ? 
  sarkozy is the son of a hungarian immigrant . 
  valls ( current prime minister ) is a spaniard with swiss ancestry . 
  i 'm a polish immigrant and my girlfriend is a cambodian immigrant . 
  more than half the people i knew in high school in northern france had one side of their family coming from a different country less than 2 generations before them , from all over europe , northern / western africa and south east asia ( so europe and old french colonies , basically ) . 
  we do n't really give a shit about that since the french `` identity '' is not so much rooted in the land , as long as you follow the values and speak the language properly you 're in . 
  the reason it clashes a lot with muslim immigrants is because some of the value and traditions from their religion clashes with what we `` traditionally/historically '' feel are french values and traditions ( which originates from european catholic values ) . 
  and most importantly those clashes push the religious theme ahead in debate which is a big no-no ( free to believe what you want , but for your sake do n't bother me with it ), 
  you 're thinking of the french civitas ( which does n't really exists outside of our borders ), 
  you know , i think there are laws against meating russians . 
  yes . 
  the reason why the difference is shown in the map i guess is because for gay people they understandably want the same , not `` oh it 's the same , but we 're not going to share the name ok '' . 
  kind of like a few decades ago `` oh black people can totally ride buses , but not the same ones ok '' . 
  it was a big deal here in france when same sex marriage happened , the opposing groups knew this was going to happen so their last try was `` only give it a different name '' . 
  and when you try to find the reasons , you get all the bullshit that amount to `` i 'm totally not homophobic , but they 're not like us !, 
  think of the children ! '', 
  as a straight guy i have since long realized to myself i had no actual reason to be against , except lingering homophobic feeling . 
  the fact that russia 's ability to produce its own power projection has dropped so low that they need to buy from western countries ( a first deal of that sort since long before the ussr dissolution ) should open your eyes as to why none of the big western countries are worried about their outdated army or him trying to push against eu or nato . 
  of course russia neighbors still feel unsafe , that i understand . 
  it 's always easier to bully the smaller guys . 
  that did n't concern ukraine because the sad fact is that ukraine does not matter in geopolitical terms for western europe nor the us and there was no reason for our government to do anything about it other than words ( you were in russia 's playground a decade ago , you 're still there now , nothing has changed and we have n't lost anything ) . 
  i 'm talking government here , you do n't start a major war for emotional and `` human right '' reasons otherwise north korea would not be . 
  hell in a cynical way i would argue the west has actually won things from the ukrainian situation , a country that used to be 100 % in russia 's grasp now has about half of it fully turned toward us . 
  in the meantime , us , france and the uk all have a small amount of planes and/or soldiers in the baltics as official nato defense force . 
  small enough to be a token and not a threat , big enough that any invasion would require killing them thus making it an attack from russia on us , not only them . 
  nato or at least the us wo n't refuse to help . 
  doing so would destroy nato in a split second , and end us-led alliance hegemony as other power blocks are created . 
  and not only in the atlantic , look at asia the entire thing is kept in check by us alliances there , if the us is not willing to keep up their nato promises because they 're scared of russia do you think japan/taiwan/korea / philippines / ... will believe they 're willing to go against china ? 
  do you think china would or would they take taiwan the way russia did with crimea ? 
  the us would react not because they 're nice and friendly , but because the consequences for them not doing it would be worse than war with russia . 
  in the same vein , france and uk would react because baltics are in the eu , and the eu is our way to stay relevant on the world stage in this century .

  france is already doing strikes on isis, 
  he meant `` not ** as ** strong as they would like it to be perceived '' . 
  and he 's right . 
  reported , because that 's a linkbait title there is no degraded rating nor increased borrowing cost ( eh , they 're lower than ever ) , the only supporting assumption is this at the end of the article :  moody 's gives its review on france on september 19 and it ** may ** not be good news . 
  another downgrade ** could ** raise french borrowing rates and create a real crisis . 
  the entire article is turned on how france need to stay in austerity but remove its labor protections and that is the only way , and monetary policies ca n't be used and blabla . 
  bonus point for this gem :  this demonstrates how austerity policies based on tax hikes instead of reduced spending stifle growth and increase deficits . 
  because countries going with reduced spending austerity are such a resounding of success . 
  both side of that coin are failing , because austerity is failed way , abused to force government to remove their social protections and services . 
   i definitely think there 's a correlation between the two . 
  `` people who are more in contact with english in their everyday life have a higher english proficiency '' , news at 11 . 
  i know you 're half joking , but it 's not about the sanctions themselves , it 's about taking a side . 
  because '' [ poland claims 45 % shortfall in russian natgas imports as of wednesday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2g4183/poland_claims_45_shortfall_in_russian_natgas/ ) '' and i 'm sure they prioritize their own needs putin can only force their hands because they are dependent on his gas , i long for the day where europe will have sufficiently developed proper alternative and when a supplier tries to force his way we can tell him to suck it and go to a competitor instead, 
  is it very probably that this falls within the percentage error of the poll ( which i could n't find ) . 
  and the people voting `` for '' are 42 % , so it 's only a 10 % difference . 
  also , `` all eu countries '' turns into `` the major eu countries '' ( which are n't listed ) . 
  great journalism there , top quality . 
  no , he 's implying that the people for/against scotland leaving the uk uses mostly the same argument as the people for/against uk leaving the eu ( which can be summed up as `` ca n't do it on your own '' vs `` forced laws different from what we vote for '' ) , and the uk alternate side which makes it uses its own argument against itself . 
  which if anything is a little funny . 
  though i still do n't understand why the uk is going for such a negativity-aligned campaign , instead of telling them why they should stay they tell them why they would not be able to be without the rest of uk taking care of them . 
  they also say the damage is not consistent with cannon damage , so you can scratch that one . 
  `` bullets '' in the sense of pistol/rifle/machine gun bullets from the ground ?
