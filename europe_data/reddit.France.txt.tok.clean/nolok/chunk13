  oh we do , there is even some permanently stationed on the charles de gaulle , and they are sometime used when it stays at toulon . 
  it 's not merely a price thing , you train for a carrier operation on a carrier , and you do n't do that on the carrier that 's actually conducting missions and has very little resting time . 
  the us always have carriers out of rotation , we do n't , so it 's a given from a practical standpoint , it would make no sense to do it internally currently . 
  i am not arguing training is n't done by the us since then , i merely said we still have our carrier training plane , and formed instructors . 
  so , it only rested on the second carrier failure . 
  we used to do training using modified super \u00e9tendards when we still had the clemenceau ( old carrier ), 
  we actually have the trainers and plane , what we do not have is the second aircraft carrier following the falling out with uk and their no catobar fiasco, 
  i believe he is not talking globally , but at the dutch coast ( what matters for the subject at hand ) . 
  they are turning off the lights more and more in france too . 
  it seems all data shows there is less accident that way because people pay more attention . 
  if it 's like france , your energy is probably super super cheap at night , because it 's actually more costly to slow the nuclear reactor down that to give the electricity for low value . 
  good luck taking territory from a nato member . 
  not even erdogan is crazy enough to risk nato membership, 
  with store bought tanks , too !, 
  ukrainian are usually well educated , have values very close to `` western '' and try to integrate in whatever community they join . 
  they 're basically poland 2 . 
  well , that , and you either joined or got azerba\u00efdjan up your bottoms with russia 's approval . 
  just saying, 
  french pr\u00e9sident fran\u00e7ois mitterand and german chancellor helmut kohl , at verdun ( biggest battlefield of ww1 ) https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcri2h1uwnrr7urqekudhrsr7vtjocf7ii3yrb9s5vank6osz__9qiuqwbwy huge moment for our countries friendship , `` never again '' . 
  it 's basically how romania got kickstarted into it , and now they are the textbook definition, 
  to avoid a usa / cuba situation , that 's why most sanctions are made on a time based span . 
  also , it let 's you silently drop them once politically feasible, 
  that 's a technicalitie . 
  very few nato facilities are officially theirs , for very much this reason . 
  what else did you expect ? 
  nato saying `` oh yes poland totally attacked us yesterday for no reason , the asses '', 
  might have been with himself though, 
  nah , he is saying not everyone consider a cow pretty, 
  no , i 'm saying finding who did those attacks is important to me and my country and we should focus on facts and not on what we want the fact to be . 
  if one of them is shown to have travelled with the migrant , then i will be doing all i can to make the government change stance on its policy , but until then i wo n't blame this policy for something it has n't done . 
  from your link :  including ** one ** assailant who ** may ** have traveled to europe on a syrian passport along with the flow of migrants . 
  there is no definitive proof yet , the source for that claim is the same greek one , and the french police have n't validated it yet . 
  no it 's not , and i never said it was . 
  but we just like every other country have had `` foreigners on french soil the police knows nothing about '' for a long time , nothing to do with the current migrant topic . 
  but , nothing indicates so far that any of the terrorists from those last attacks were n't all french , and the previous attacks ( all 3 people in the january attacks , mohammed merah , . . ) were all french citizen too . 
  `` ahmed almuhamed '' and `` mohammed almuhamed '' ... 
  this is pretty much the `` john smith '' of the arab world . 
  just that name with no picture , and even more importantly no report from the french police ( the only one with access to it ) about the name of the people who committed the attack ... that 's tabloid news . 
  the french police has not been able to identify them yet except one - a french citizen - nor to identify where they come from and how long they have been in france , or their names . 
  the only link they have now is toward a belgian connection . 
   ah we have a new rule : if a terrorist enters europe via the balkan route he is not part of the `` refugee crisis '' . 
  you do n't get it : he was in syria , yes , but current assumption is that he came back by taking a plane for turkey , just as when he left . 
  there is absolutely nothing that points to him taking the long on foot balkan route when he did n't need to as the owner of a valid french passport . 
  if he did take a plane from turkey , he would have entered france unimpeded . 
   what you dont seem to get is that people here are not mentioning that some of the terrorists arrived via greek because they hate sysrian refugees . 
  they mention it because this is exactly what happens if you run an open border regime what you do n't seem to get is that french people like me just got hit and would like to see the real facts and culprits exposed rather than narrow minded people using the event to justify their own agendas even if there is no facts to support that yet . 
  whether it 's the government trying to justify more draconian surveillance law , citizen trying to pin it on the migrant crisis to blame it , or whatever . 
  i 'm not supportive of the current eu `` open borders toward middle east migrants and let it flow '' policy at all , but there is nothing in yesterday 's event that hint at a link between the two yet , and i find it horrible short sighted and stupid to force a link between the two just because you want it to exists . 
  source ? 
  that 's not what is said by the french authorities , one is identified and french citizen , one might or might not be the owner of the fake syrian passport found on the scene , and the others have not been identified in any way yet . 
  they are looking at a belgian group connection . 
  the only identified person so far is born and raised in france , and has a perfectly legal and valid french passport . 
  on the other hand the fake syrian passport has not been 100 % linked to any attacker yet , it was merely found on the scene . 
  actually ... 
  the first one only had a passport near him , and the authorities have n't yet linked the person to the passport , so there is no way to say if it 's him or a planted passport of what . 
  the other one is not a syrian migrant at all , he is a frenchman , born and raised , living in france . 
  he did go to syria for a year , but that does n't make him a syrian migrant ( he is not one of the many migrant / asylum seeker getting in the eu lately ) . 
  the gripen is a swedish design , assembled in sweden and with a lot of swedish components , but some are n't swedish and most importantly it requires british 's engines , and on afighter jet the engines are one of the most crucial thing ( as the chinese are learning ) . 
  when talking on the subject including here on reddit you can often see english people mocking the french / dassault for going with the french snecma rather than the british bae for the rafale 's engine , even though bae 's engine was better for the same price , but this was a purposeful decision of strategical independence from our government , one that i agree with ( without it , snecma would have closed and france would have lost the ability to make it 's own jet fighters engines - again , one of the most important piece , that very few countries can make ) . 
  japan and israel are both countries considered capable of developing the know how very rapidly if need be , but they do n't have it right now ( mostly because it 's cheaper to buy us jets for them ) . 
  similar to how japan and germany are n't nuclear powers but they could become one in a very short time if need be . 
  beijing is in the exact same situation, 
  tell that to scotland, 
  the old roomies with the new ones . 
  not enough room for everyone . 
  france and russia have mostly been allied or close through history . 
  really the only time we were at war was when napoleon was dominating europe and scared the russians ( and even then , the tzar liked the guy and defended him after his defeat , insisting that he be ruler over elba and not a prisonner ) . 
  for the record , the government of mali , a former colony with whom we retain close ties and relationship , asked us ( in a letter also sent to the un ) to help them against an external threat they could n't stop . 
  i do n't consider that quite the same at `` interventionist '' . 
  if finland calls for us to help against a hypothetical russian invasion , i would n't consider it that either . 
  i would call it helping a friend and ally in need . 
  the best result of a president during the 5th republic was when the fn got to the second turn , chirac got an insane 83 % with a very high voter turnout ( roughly 80 % ) , even though tons of people wanted change at all cost and not him again . 
  i have faith that my country men , despite the terrible political situation in france for the past ten years , will not elect the le pen family clan they call a political party . 
  and that , my friend , is why the dutch are our allies . 
  also , because they 're awesome . 
  but mostly the other thingies . 
  then you greatly underestimate our arrogance and our belief in the `` french exception '' . 
  it 's a common subject of mockery here on reddit on a regular basis , but it 's also the biggest reassurance that we would act . 
  also in this particular case , our arrogance is kind of justified , france has nothing to envy russia on a military basis , in fact it is them that came to us to buy things they need but do n't know how to build , not the other way around . 
  putting troops there while at peace , when we do n't feel at all that russia is a threat to us or our interests ? 
  yeah we 're slacking , `` why do that ? 
  '' , `` they would n't dare '' , ... 
  still , we 're the only one of the big 5 eu economies who accepted to take one for the team economically ( the mistral sale cancellation , for which poland repaid us by screwing us up with the helicopter deal for some reason ... ) . 
  acting against a foreign country not respecting our area of influence and making us look bad ? 
  `` fuck you , we 're french '' is the best summary of the reaction you can expect . 
  nothing much can unite the french voters than another country saying france 's opinion does n't matter and/or that france ca n't do anything about it , it just makes us want to do something about it , if only to make a point . 
  i agree , but it is a difficult subject because no country want to lose their own capabilities . 
  so you can either end up with an eurofighter project ( little bit of it everywhere , not by need but by design to keep everyone happy ) , or some countries losing capabilities , or everyone staying on their own stuff ( france leaving eurofighter and going with rafale ) . 
  i think the solution to that can be mergers to create larger competent european companies , but we need to still ensure there is decent competition even inside the eu . 
  on the other hand , we have the capabilities to be entirely independent on that front and i believe this is something we need to absolutely keep . 
  eg for the fighters , eurofighter is dependent on the uk ( soon to be non eu country ) , gripen on usa . 
  uk nukes are dependent on the usa . 
  etc ... 
  eh , france is more america than america itself , even politically . 
  most of the time when you hear people talk about what they \\* think \\* the american president 's powers are , they are describing the much larger range of powers from the french president instead . 
  like that `` war in syria '' thingy where both uk and us toned it down when it came clear their legislative houses were n't going for it , while hollande was all in because he did n't need no approval to send troops anywhere he wanted . 
  not trying to say it 's a good or a bad thing , but thinking we are the best while telling others how they should run their house has kind of been our thing since before the usa even started to exist . 
  that 's also why the baltics are n't getting invaded by putin anytime soon us support or not . 
  doing so would be breaking france 's and germany 's toy ( the eu ) , and only a fool would think they would let that happen . 
  there is a reason these are the two countries pushing for a eu army .
