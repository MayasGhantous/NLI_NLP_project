  i think our lack of serious reaction is pissing him off , too . 
  also , putin must be kind of disappointed . 
  years after years in the making to try and make the european countries separate from each other again instead of being a strong union , finally someone like trump in the us happens and turkey goes full swing , but they 're so damn dumb and obvious that all they achieve is making us feel closer to each other . 
  yeah putin-buddy , turns out the other populist nationalist fascist are not playing dumb , they really are . 
  well of course the party holding pro corruption manifestation is disappointed we drop a voting method that can be corrupted . 
  let 's take a moment to remember the amount of fraud in their election between cope and fillon , where each side 's defense was `` but the other side did it too ! '', 
  yet from what i understood this is the first time in their history since their election a couple weeks ago that the pro uk parties do n't have a majority in their parliament, 
  yup . 
  [ in protest to germany 's recognition of armenian genocide , turkish mayor orders the mercedes sign on official vehicles to be covered ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mz0o6/in_protest_to_germanys_recognition_of_armenian/ ) and the picture : https://i.redditmedia.com/xopbeguqbykc3cs8ttbxx6iimqdxx8upx60ct9fptzw.jpg?w=850&amp;s=a9553f7a0fc276f83368c5768d0f1815 i 'm still not sure if stabbing oranges is a step up or down from that . 
  clearly you do n't remember that these guys protested germans last year by hiding the mercedes logo on their car . 
  they 're evidently not very good at protesting , 
  eu started as a free trade agreement . 
  le pen is much more of a fascist that trump ever will be . 
  trump sounds like a guy who does n't quite understands what 's the president job and what his area of authority actually entails . 
  le pen , just this week , threatened `` fonctionnaires '' ( employees of the state , eg policeman , juges , ... ) acting against her interest that they would `` pay '' should she be elected . 
  she managed in what is probably a first for the country to get both the police right wing syndicate and the judge left wing syndicate to both decry her speech . 
  the woman is as fascist as they come . 
  fillon 's problem is n't the amount he stole . 
  it 's that he campaigned and won on an `` i 'm clean '' platform , then promised he would leave if he got charged . 
  then he got charged he said `` yolo , i do n't care !!!, 
  uhh no . 
  the court did n't find her to be fascist . 
  they found calling her a fascist to be protected under one 's political opinion . 
  i hate the woman and i do think she 's a fascist , but that ruling was about protecting people 's political opinion , not about judging her . 
  seriously , to germany ? 
  i mean , if it was poland or hongaria i could understand , but germany ? 
  does he even pretend to listen to his advisors sometimes ? 
  by european standards , both parties in the usa are right wing populism . 
  i mean in france the democrats would only have the front national further on their right , and that 's freaking le pen the fascist . 
  thank you . 
  i was about to tell the other comment i had no idea what nationalist meant in the case of ni so your parentheses are super helpful , 
  i doubt anyone , ni , uk or eu would let anything pass that breaks the gfa without having a ton of replacing agreements in place beforehand . 
  nobody wants a `` civil war '' situation coming back in west / northern europe . 
  what are sinn fein standing for ? 
  and are the dup pro single ireland , or pro united with the uk ? 
  it 's northern ireland . 
  no offense to my irish friends but the instant they had their hands on something that came anywhere close to `` we 're not killing each others constantly anymore '' they took it and ran with it . 
  well her thing is to get her family power and money . 
  those things are the whoring out path they chose to achieve that . 
  equality of all eu citizens is as wise as they come ? 
  well of course , the rest is from scotts and french normans ( that should trigger him alright ), 
   for the eu , it is a first trade pact with a g7 country that statement while not entirely false is a bit weird i think . 
  the eu first `` trade pact '' with g7 countries was the single market . 
  which as of today includes 4 of the 7 g7 members . 
  i think it 's like france , if charged with x number of crimes , you get only the largest sentence of those for which you are convicted . 
  eg if you get convicted for a 10 years sentence and a 5 years sentence during the same trial , you get only the 10 years one , they do n't accumulate . 
  personally i like it better , i 'm not a big fan of the ginormous sentence as can be seen in , say , the us . 
  my point of view is that someone who 's been in prison for 20 + years will have very very low chance of ever re-integrating , if it 's because of one crime that 's worth that much of a sentence then ok , but spending 20 years in prison for accumulation of 3/5 years charges on the same trial is just conter-productive , and it also leads to people making any deal rather than letting justice be played , because better a 5 years deal than the risk of a 40 years conviction . 
  he told you the game they played , he did n't say they were good at it . 
  we do n't talk about that . 
  half dutch , half french , i think they 're pretty much cursed already . 
  but the good kind . 
  that goes without saying, 
  funny you took that example since the father of previous president of france ( nicolas sarkozy ) is a hungarian . 
  well , 9 . 
  for the record , the eu decided countries had to include the gdp from drugs sale and prostitution in their official numbers . 
  uk included it and that 's when they went from 6 to 5 ( ahead of france ) . 
  france still has n't included it , because they think it does n't make sense . 
  so , the 5/6 spot fight is more a case of bickering about the number than one actually being ahead of the other . 
   by 2009 , the sector accounted for ** 10 % of uk gdp ** , the highest of all g7 economies . 
  the second highest was canada at 6.7 % , and the lowest was germany at 3.9 % . 
   financial services are a key part of uk exports . 
  britain has the highest ratio of services exports to gdp in the g7 , at 13 % . 
  it also has ** the biggest share of financial services exports by some way , at 29 % in 2012 ** . 
  the second is the us at 15 % , with japan exporting the least at 3 % .

  your point being ? 
  i have n't said anything about french being second place , nor french being at any particular place , i answered someone who assumed all would be in english by saying no there is at least french that i know of . 
  i agree with you in general , but to be pedantic there are nobel winners who published their results for which they got the medal in french . 
  not sure about other language ( so i guess you can say `` of course it 's the damn french '' ) . 
  i 'm sorry for the scotts and i genuinely hope their future is as part of the eu , but it 's them that are part of an union where their opinion can be ignored . 
  if the uk itself does n't give scotland the right to block brexit even though they as a country are against it , i do n't see why it would be the eu 's job to give preferential treatment to the whole union , including the parts that want to leave so bad . 
  like the other guy said , the scotts will now have a choice between uk and eu , i do n't claim to know which one is better for them but we certainly ca n't make it for them , and we should n't bow down to the whole uk just to help them - otherwise they will never have to make the choice , and that 's the worst situation possible for us . 
  tell that to the uk . 
  spain wo n't do that , they will just ignore it , like they did last time . 
  if they deploy troops , they give recognition to it , and the chance for motivated people to rebel . 
  oh but that 's just the thing . 
  he seems to be one of the only few that was n't playing dirty and stupid . 
  given some of the articles linked here , it seems their whole dispute comes from him talking to other eu representative and then telling may that they were n't rolling at all with her wishes . 
  so , in other words , he probably was n't willing to roll with the `` give me more stuff for less money '' rethoric that seems to be may 's will so far . 
  for the record , the only part of france that really has an independentist will is corsica . 
  and even then , they mostly did it to get more free stuff from paris ( which they got ) . 
  if someone is going to try and force brittons or nicois to vote for something they do n't want , i wish them luck . 
  these are not the kind of people you can throw around . 
  we can barely make them vote for what they do want ... 
  does n't matter who she will be up against , even amongst the french willing to vote for anyone that promise change a lot are still absolutely unwilling to vote le pen and for good reason . 
  also , presidential election usually have a turnout in the 80 % range here . 
  except he was pm and putin was merely dodging around russian law to keep control of the country . 
  he was also head of government ( and so responsible for a lot of shit ) during the 5 years of sarkozy . 
  i ca n't believe people are not making him more accountable for that . 
  the von neumann currency . 
  they have more autonomy than any other region , almost similar to our remote islands . 
  they still are like that . 
  beautiful land , beautiful people , beautiful culture , but my god are they prone to crime . 
  so yes , i think they would fit well in italy . 
  well everyone can tell you how that will go already . 
  the eu will say `` ok no hard feelings you can access the market on the same rules as other members '' and the ok will be angry at not being given a special offer just for them . 
  yeah i do n't think i can have a productive discussion on this sorry , legislative having power over the judiciary is something that goes completely against my belief ( especially considering how modern parties means the executive has a decent amount of power over the legislative ) . 
  is he an expert or something ? 
  you guys tried 3 times , being fully vetoed .
