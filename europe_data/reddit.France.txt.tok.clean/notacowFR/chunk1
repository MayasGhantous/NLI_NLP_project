question | answer -- | -- where are you from ? 
  | france what languages can you speak fluently ? 
  | english , french , and spanish what is your usual timezone ? 
  | france , which is utc +2 right now have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit ? 
  | yes , i helped to moderate a medium-sized forum a few years ago . 
  what do you like the most about / r/europe ? 
  | i like how all europeans can get together and discuss each other 's countries . 
  do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone ? 
  | working as a team , but i can work alone if needed . 
  in general , how would you evaluate / r/europe 's rules ? 
  | they are good , but the comment rules could be enforced better . 
  especially 2 and 3 ( bigotry and attacks on other users ) . 
  for example , when stuff was happening in turkey about a month ago , some of the comments for the threads had some strong views on turks as an ethnicity . 
  what change would you make in / r/europe if you could ? 
  | like i said above , i would put more time into enforcing the comment rules . 
  why do you want to join / r/europe 's mod team ? 
  | i love this community and i want to help to run it . 
  do you think politically neutral moderation is achievable and/or desirable ? 
  | yes , in a perfect world it would be desirable . 
  but reddit is very left-leaning , which has caused the right to go onto their own subreddits , so i think it would be difficult to achieve . 
  why is it blocked in those countries ? 
   the uk generates demand , as opposed to germany , which is essentially a black hole for the world economy . 
  this makes no sense . 
  you could also say this the opposite way and say germany generates supply while the uk is a black hole . 
  actually , that would be a slightly better theory because the way economics work is that ** the consumer benefits from increased supply or decreased demand ** . 
  so i could write an article on a terrible german newspaper titled `` the uk 's trade deficit is a threat to global stability , and must be fixed '' and it would be less wrong than yours . 
  just like your well-written article , which poses great ideas on how to improve the world economy and the lives of germans . 
  many americans and russians go to the czech republic . 
  they have a lot of jobs open to foreigners ( especially in software development ! ) . 
  the problem is that they have a difficult language , so it would be harder to stay permanently and get citizenship . 
  also , the average salaries there are lower . 
  for those reasons , most people only stay there for a few years until they can get into germany or the uk . 
  but i do n't think you can get a good answer here . 
  90 % of us are already eu citizens so we have never dealt with this personally . 
  / r/iwantout would get you better answers , but be more specific when posting there . 
  good luck !, 
  ok . hi , i am a citizen of my country looking for something to do . 
  i am wondering which cities/towns in the world are good in terms of finding stuff where people are more open do to things . 
  from my research , groups in europe are open to do stuff . 
  where else ? 
  i am looking for a job . 
  turkish food is the best food ever . 
  no other cuisine comes close . 
  also , your street cats are so cute . 
  [ france 24 ] ( http://www.france24.com/fr/ ) is the most reputable in my opinion . 
  it 's our version of the bbc or pbs . 
  if you go on youtube you can find their live streams in french , english , and arabic . 
  in terms of newspapers , here is a [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_newspapers_in_france ) . 
  i personally look at [ le parisien ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/ ) , which i guess is like your new york times . 
  for a beginner to the french language i 'd recommend [ 20 minutes ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/ ) . 
  it 's easier to read because distributed on the metro , and is geared toward the average commuter rather than a smart person who reads newspapers regularly . 
  the articles are also shorter . 
  he could n't get his healthcare and immigration reforms through congress , so he used executive authority to just push them past . 
  i am a `` centre-left soc-dem '' too but you have to admit that what he did is against the principles of democracy . 
   if there 's a list of skills that eu employers want of overseas applicants , i need a link so i can see which ones i have ( or am interested in obtaining . ), 
  these lists are done by the individual countries ' governments . 
  here are those of [ austria ] ( http://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration/skilled-workers-in-shortage-occupations/shortage-occupations-list-2017.html ) and [ the uk ] ( https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-k-shortage-occupation-list ) for example . 
  these are official government lists made so it will be easier for people with these skills to immigrate . 
  ** it seems like nursing and mechanical engineering are the best choices ** if you want options for which country you will go to . 
  if you do n't want to go to university , go get an apprenticeship as a roofer in the us . 
  right after you finish your training you will be eligible to go to austria to get a job as a roofer . 
  then you can apply to be an austrian citizen after living there for 10 years . 
  austria is a great choice if you want to stay permanently , because even if they want to deny your citizenship ( they probably wo n't if you can speak german and are n't a criminal ) you actually have * the right to take it * after you live there for 30 years . 
  i do n't know of any other european countries that give you the right to undeniable citizenship . 
  why no poached eggs ? 
  wait ... are you a trump supporter ? 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee * downvotes *, 
  the people who vote for donald trump and marine le pen are evil racists who kill puppies . 
  pls upvote, 
  i know people who voted for our supposedly far-right candidate , and they are n't even racist . 
  they are anti-immigration because of the economic issues ; they have no preference between a syrian immigrant and a swiss immigrant . 
  yeah , europe is like that . 
  fuck your poached eggs . 
   at least one of them, 
   sure , but that does n't mean that we should n't try to minimize it . 
  you would not agree to poor french citizens being governed by a different set of laws than richer citizens , for example . 
  i agree that one 's wealth should not decide which laws they must follow , but i do think different areas need different laws . 
  for example , somebody living in the expensive paris region needs more money than somebody living in the suburbs of undesirable calais . 
  like you said , instead of moving the parisien to calais , we should try to give him a good life while not giving the person in calais a much better life . 
  if laws on things like minimum wage are universal across the eu , people in cheap eastern europe will see massive , unnecessary raises in their pay lead to inflation , causing one of two things to happen : 1 . 
  people in minimum-wage jobs in expensive cities like paris will not see their wages increase with the new inflation , and there will be a new wealth gap ; or 2 . 
  the more expensive areas will introduce their own higher minimum wage and we are back to where we started , except with some loss of value in the currency . 
   of course the army would have agreed responses to immediate threats and defensive actions - you do n't really need much of an agreement to defend your allies , we already signed nato 's article 5 . 
  the problem here is that there has to be one leader of the army . 
  there is resent toward economies being regulated by people from other countries in brussels , so would n't people be unwilling to risk their lives for them ? 
  it would be more effective for nations to respond to threats individually or bilaterally with other countries . 
  ( nsfl , nsfw )  * the insertion of rats into genitals * i hate to direct attention toward this specific part , but how is that even possible ? 
  it 's definitely impossible to do to a man , and i doubt that a rat could fit into a woman . 
  a mouse maybe , but not a rat . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande . 
  * drops mic *, 
   some of your rights depend on your physical location . 
  it is true that we can move easily to the place with the best deal , but the goal should be to get us all on the same page , not make everyone move to the richest parts . 
  this is a problem everywhere , even within countries . 
  someone in a low-income area with a high crime rate has a much different quality of life than a person in a rich neighbourhood with great schools . 
  this problem will never go away entirely as long as humans are different from each other . 
   they could both take orders from a supranational system . 
  we already kind of do it through the un , but this would be a smaller and more culturally similar union that would prevent the eternal state of permanent banning . 
  the un functions as a supranational military because it requires a vote before action . 
  are you suggesting that the eu parliament should have to approve every military action ?
