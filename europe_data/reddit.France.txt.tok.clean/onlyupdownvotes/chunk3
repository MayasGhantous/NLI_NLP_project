  oh , man this . 
  living in japan , i felt responsible for good behavior since there is so much suspicion of foreigners in general . 
  now in france , i 've unfortunately seen more discrimination against even other eu citizens in exactly the way you describe . 
  in theory i 'd agree with you , bu in reality , the student probably faces more trouble . 
  the 60b french debtor buys himself out of trouble . 
  the student can not . 
  a lot of foreigners working in dubai would n't be able to either : 2/3 of them are working in low-skill low-pay jobs , and many of the white-collar workers have been in sudden . 
  hell the uk expat article is about avoiding tv council fees . 
  the fuck , seriously . 
  edit : ... debt as the emirates have felt some economic pressure . 
  anyway . 
  just pay them .

  indeed . 
  attempt at a bad joke comes back to bite me in the ass . 
  switzerland is an exception , never compare yourself to switzerland . 
  or japan . 
  did you go to zurich ? 
  you can * swim * in the river that runs through the middle of the city . 
  come visit paris . 
  i found bucharest cleaner than many parts of paris . 
  nice map , but i 'm waiting for the full report which also includes the parameters of 1 ) ratios of genders said people are attracted to and 2 ) relationship availability of said people . 
  i suspect the publication of the full report is delayed because these values are not binary . 
  i guess i have n't lived in france long enough to agree with the other french posting here . 
  i 'll be satisfied if i never get into the louvre again . 
  my top choices : * ok , the louvre . 
  the fountains and glass pyramid are neat . 
  i love the archway with the big glass windows looking into the italian marble sculptures . 
  it 's best seen at night when the soft yellow glow sodium lamps are on . 
  * if you want to see an art museum !, 
  i like the orsay for its diversity and the fact that you can see the whole thing in 3 or 4 hours . 
  the building itself does n't overwhelm the art ( like the louvre ) and knowing that it used to be a train station is cool . 
  * for not-art museums , my favorite is the mus\u00e9e des moyens ages ( museum of the middle ages ) . 
  i like the diversity of material : lots of carved wood and stone . 
  colorful stained glass . 
  highlights are ( of course ) the tapestries of `` lady and the unicorn '' and my favorite the chapel . 
  it 's at the end of the visit in a room off the corner of another room so a lot of people seem to miss it . 
  arches , tiles , carvings , crystal , gold leaf , everything . 
  you can usually have the room to yourself . 
  i also really like the museum of immigration , and the albert kahn museum and gardens , but moyens ages is still my `` coup de c\u0153ur '' . 
  i 'm also sure there are museums in france outside of paris , but i have n't been to any of them . 
  i know , i know , shame , i 'll fix it . 
  clearly , the sample is biased . 
  google translator vs pikachu ? 
  yeah , i 'll go with pikachu as being cuter and more preppy . 
  [ much more detailed article here ] ( http://lci.tf1.fr/france/societe/reforme-orthographique-10-mots-qui-vont-changer-a-la-rentree-8712574.html ) ( in old-fashioned french ) . 
  not surprised to see albert kahn was involved !, 
  whenever you are in paris dare to cross the city border to see his museum in boulogne-bilancourt ( do n't worry , it 's still on the metro and very safe ! ) . 
  there are always awesome photography exhibits , as well as a japanese garden , a rose garden , and an apple orchard .

  i recently touristed in mostar and felt comfortable and never harassed ( there was one guy who really wanted to be a tour guide for a day , but you get that in much of the world ) . 
  on the contrary , we talked to a lot of really interesting people . 
  the food is indeed very good . 
  even after leaving bosnia we ate at bosnian restaurants during the rest of our stay , in croatia . 
  i 've been repeatedly told sarajevo is beautiful and recommended to take the sarajevo - mostar train . 
  next time ... 
  `` number of executions as a percentage of all `` guilty '' sentences '' in poland : \u043d\u0435 \u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e - not available . 
  how nefarious !, 
  paris here . 
  i 've only seen them on reddit and bfmtv ( the classy network that outed the people hidden in the kosher grocery on live tv ) . 
  well , i do n't think amsterdam has its own immigration , but the netherlands may have stamped you !, 
  the lack of cool stamps is a disappointment , but the hassle-free travel and single currency more than compensate . 
  i do still appreciate how you get different entering-schengen stamps depending on your mode of transportation : airplanes , cars , boats , trains ... is there an on-foot one ? 
  next time , hit more of eastern and south-eastern europe . 
  my favoirte ( unintentional ) stamp-run was on the highway between mostar and dubrovnik , where you can earn , like , 6 different stamps from bih and croatia . 
  i think you can get separate stamps from all of former yugoslavia , but ca n't confirm . 
  on another route , northern bulgaria has some beautiful sights and is a convenient day-trip from bucharest . 
  serbia may take an extra day to get to conveniently , but it 's on the western side of romania . 
  ukraine 's further east , but , visa . 
  ah , you wanted cities only . 
  fair enough . 
  adding bretagne ( brittany ) for france . 
  i 've never seen `` lyons '' , but then again , i 'm only an american . 
  [ the economist explains itself : why are the economist 's writers anonymous ? 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-1 ) the keyword that helped find this article was `` byline '' . 
  the economist and others have more articles out there on the same subject . 
  food for thought about the older society comment wrt japan : [ `` in japan , the elderly are committing more crimes than teenagers '' ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/07/17/in-japan-the-elderly-are-committing-more-crimes-than-teenagers/ ) . 
  basically , more elderly , less family support , more poverty among the elderly . 
  sad . 
  things that are in the news ... are in the news because they are unusual . 
  ( this is a generalization ; i do n't know anything about poland and safety ), 
   holland is just a part of the netherlands true , but tell that to the other languages that use `` holland '' as their only name for the country . 
  looking at you , japanese , chinese . 
  no comment on the quality , but rather on the recent events that have made audiences nervous : bataclan attack & colectiv fire . 
  harsh , man . 
  this is one of the least fair jokes the english language makes on its learners . 
  when you see the words written out , it makes sense .
