  third = 3rd second = 2nd first = 1st . 
  here 's your poster , [ official government website ] ( http://www.gouvernement.fr/reagir-attaque-terroriste ), 
  good article . 
  i was surprised to read one all about bureaucracy , politics , and economics . 
  not a mention of bucharest or paris . 
  former japan resident here . 
  can confirm lots of hours / low productivity , but yes , thorough . 
  you 're encouraged - nay , socially obligated - to come in before your boss and leave after your boss . 
  to make up for that , you spend hours staring numbly at your screen . 
  minutely adjusting powerpoint font sizes . 
  filling out unnecessary forms to be unnecessarily stamped . 
  seeking any possible safety vulnerability to correct ( anzen dai ichi ! ) . 
  once you leave the office , several nights a week will be spent out drinking with your colleagues . 
  the renowned capsule hotels ? 
  they 're designed with the salaryman in mind , who has missed the last train home while in the bar or finishing up a report . 
  if you want a slighly exaggerated version of this story , look for a translation of nathalie notomb 's [ fear and trembling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fear_and_trembling_ ( novel ) ) . 
  the author ( belgian , female ) gets a job in a japanese company leading to adventures and humiliation . 
  a bit overly dramatic and a bit dated , but the more things change ... 
  i should conclude saying that i loved living in japan and mostly i loved working there , but as a foreigner working in a foreign company the experience was much gentler than for the locals . 
  ok , i could have worded that better , but i think you know what i mean . 
   if interviewed at home offer them a cup of tea . 
  stereotype proven , 
  where i went to university , if there was no bank holiday in the month , there was a `` student holiday '' . 
  informally known as `` suicide days '' , the day off was supposed to be a little break we could look forward to ... 
  nice album . 
  recently there was an `` after '' gallery linked . 
  the city is unrecognizable !, 
  i 'm surprised not to have seen a hexagon as the top answer . 
  maybe a hexagon with a paris-dot in the middle . 
  you say `` pretty good '' , i say `` over-achiever '' . 
  they get treated like people from a country who are at a high risk of entering on a tourist visa and then sticking around after their 90 days are up . 
  it 's one of those `` this is why we ca n't have nice things '' situations . 
   so far as i can tell its specifically referring to specific nationals with a history of travel to iraq , iran , syria , or the sudan . 
  the us proposal is . 
  from what i could read , the eu response was not clarified . 
  your last sentence made me smile , because i agree with you about the `` feel-good '' aspect , except that i think that will make it even more likely to pass !, 
  so many things to be bugged by ... 1 ) reciprocity agreements are not always the case . 
  this one says it would be `` legally mandated '' but i 'm not sure of the history on that , despite having read the article . 
  2 ) `` reciprocity '' could very well be interpreted as `` us citizens who have traveled to ... '' 3 ) the esta requirement imposed on citizens of visa waiver countries is essentially a non-visa-visa . 
  everyone loves paperwork , though !, 
  4 ) not all eu member states are in the visa waiver program . 
  romania is among them ; romanian citizens still need a visa to travel in the us . 
  5 ) this all ignores the security gaps that have granted visas to people who ended up changing the us and world history . 
  of course it will all be better now that they [ acknowledge checking your social media ] ( http://bgr.com/2015/12/15/dhs-face-book-visa-program/ ) as part of your us visa application process . 
   re-wildered i fucking love this word and will add it to my lexicon . 
  you might be looking for something like `` they 've gone feral '' but that sounds so much less cool . 
  i dunno , it could be using the privacy and banking culture to hide bajillions of ill-begotten wwii gains . 
  does that count ? 
  or , popularizing cowbells and yodeling . 
  it is ? 
  the only ( only ! ), 
  `` evidence '' given is that a regional party won some place in the elections . 
  which i do n't find terribly surprising in a set of elections where many people had trouble finding someone they wanted to vote for ( lots of `` white votes '' ) . 
  that 's a really interesting article . 
  thank you for sharing it . 
  thank you for mentioning this !, 
  i also finished the book recently , having read it because of the uproar it made here . 
  since then , i 've been looking for the `` anti-houellebecq '' , an alternative future novel of a different political persuasion . 
  ( looking for recommendations ... preferably with less philosophical wankery than in * soumission * ), 
  oup , that was it . 
  good find , i figured it would be a fruitless search . 
  looking at the video 's length , yea , i was n't watching the clock . 
  ( it also goes to show how boring every other video was ) . 
  highly recommended viewing , that link . 
  did any of you see the animated poland history movie at the world expo in milan ? 
  fuck , was it dark . 
  and damn , was it good . 
  at about 20 minutes long , it felt like 5 and was the only video i was n't anxious to leave . 
  they could lengthen it and biggen the screen to get their hollywood film . 
  ( explosions and gunfire already there ; needs more car chase and beautiful women in need of rescue . ), 
  france : the rest of the world revolves around it !, 
  [ random article in english ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/324965-hungary-jet-bomb-search/ ) fuck reddit formatting . 
  that 's true , thank you for adding it . 
  `` made '' does n't mean what it used to , either . 
  read up on things that are `` made in italy '' . 
  there are whole industries popping up where ( mostly chinese ) companies do just enough work in china - and no more - so the garment can be labeled as `` made in italy '' . 
  the production in italy is owned by the same company so ask revenue leaves europe . 
  in some cases the employees are brought over , too . 
  yay , globalization !, 
  i 'll let someone else with a real keyboard and screen add some citations . 
  in retaliation , the orthodox church says `` well fine , be that way . 
  we 're not coming to inaugurate the new school year , then . '', 
  i move to one of these countries and it makes me healthier ? 
  i 'm down with that . 
  much easier than the whole eating right and exercising thing . 
  having seen a lot of the country , i have to say i 've felt safer in many romanian cities than many major cities in western europe . 
  i 've been for work , too , and appreciate the opportunity to change my colleagues ' ideas about what romania ( and romanians ) is like . 
  yeah , and there 's a lot of beautiful stuff . 
  i 'll be saving my 2024 vacation to blow town for the duration . 
   paris damn it , hamburg !, 
  and i 'll add one other follow-up no one will see : i learned a ton by watching repetitive pop music videos . 
  they 're inane , but if you watch the lyric videos on youtube , you get to read , listen , and if you dare , sing along . 
  this method touches 3 major aspects of language learning plus cultural stuff . 
  forget duolinguo and moccha , i learned romanian from voltaj and ruby and proconsul . 
  vocabular nou in fiecare fraza !, 
   do n't even want skilled immigrants . 
  hi , i 'm from the us ( h1b ) and moved to france under a highly-skilled-type visa ( engineer ) . 
  h1b 's are controversial as skilled immigrants because they may cost less than hiring americans . 
  france has had long issues with unemployment and is now fair game to many europeans looking for a better salary than their home countries can offer . 
  it 's not as simple as `` their takin er jerbs '' but , well , yeah .
