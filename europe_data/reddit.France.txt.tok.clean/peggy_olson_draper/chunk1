certain newspaper have controversially attacked the new muslim minister of education is she muslim ? 
  i do n't remember her even talking about her religion . 
  like most french politicians . 
  for greece , [ the fisrt exit polls result say syriza comes first ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2014/05/25/greece-elections-2014-exit-polls-ep-municipality-regional/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed%3a+keeptalkinggreece+ ( keep + talking + greece ) with 26 to 30 % , followed by the neo democrats at 23-27 % ( golden dawn at 8 to 10 % ) . 
  turnout in france : 15,70 % at 12 . 
  ( 14,81 % in 2009 ) 35,07 at 5pm . 
  ( 33,18 in 2009 ) estimated final turnout : 43 % ( 40,6 in 2009 ) . 
  for france the arte stream is much better than the lcp or it\u00e9l\u00e9 ones . 
  the translation is better and more fluid : http://europe.arte.tv/fr/evenements/debat-cinq-candidats-pour-une-commission/, 
  i cringed when she was asked before the ceremony which french film she liked this year and could n't answer so went with `` the 400 blows '' come on !, 
  you actually have 3 : there are 2 animated movies as well ( one short , one long ) . 
  oh we know  the media spent the week reporting on how it is viewed abroad , particularly in the uk . 
  no , there were not that popular . 
  although i 'm not sure the number is a good argument to use ( if there 's something i consider `` dangerous '' , that i think should be forbiddden by the law , saying it concerns only 1 or 2 people is not going to make me change my mind ) . 
  it 's a very controversial topic in france . 
  we have quite a lot of our citizens who came from africa ( former colonies ) , some being muslims . 
  they were ostracised in ghettos , which may explain why some of them clinged to their religion to forge their identity ( being torn between two identities : not africans like their parents but not fully recognised as french citizens ) . 
  but of course the vast majority is just living peacefully and causing no problems at all . 
  the thing is france being a secular country , the emphasis on everything too visible is seen as a provocation by many . 
  there 's a huge debate on integration here , with the majority of people and politicians always saying that immigrants have to adapt to france 's way of living . 
  in my opinion we have laws : as long as they respect them there 's no problem , it 's not the politicians ' role to decide how people should live , which traditions they should follow or not , it just happens , naturally and evolves with history , with the different waves of immigration that occur . 
  as for religious sign : france is a secular country : which should mean that the state is completely separated from the influence of any faith but also that it recognises all religions for its citizens . 
  well since the mid 80s and the focus on dangerous muslims overtaking `` us '' and willing to impose their traditions in our laws , this definition of what `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' is has been gradually changed and now there 's a form of suspicion against muslims . 
  the government seems to be willing to decide what is considered `` good islam '' ... which i see as totally opoosite to the idea of secularism : it 's the muslims who should themselves decide how their religion has to evolve , how they want to live it , the state has no say in it . 
  ( we already had laws agaisnt covering your face , yes ) . 
  oh , my bad , the way i phrased it made it sound like i was referring to hollande . 
  in a speech in dakar in 2007 he said :  `` the tragedy of africa is that ** the african has not fully entered into history ** . 
  the african peasant , who for thousands of years have lived according to the seasons , whose life ideal was to be in harmony with nature , only knew the eternal renewal of time , rhythmed by the endless repetition of the same gestures and the same words . 
   in this imaginary world where everything starts over and over again there is no place for human adventure or for the idea of progress . 
   in this universe where nature commands all , man escapes from the anguish of history that torments modern man , but he rests immobile in the centre of a static order where everything seems to have been written beforehand . 
   this man ( the traditional african ) never launched himself towards the future . 
  the idea never came to him to get out of this repetition and to invent his own destiny . 
   the problem of africa , and allow a friend of africa to say it , is to be found here . 
  africa 's challenge is to enter to a greater extent into history . 
  to take from it the energy , the force , the desire , the willingness to listen and to espouse its own history . 
   africa 's problem is to stop always repeating , always mulling over , to liberate itself from the myth of the eternal return . 
  it is to realise that the golden age that africa is forever recalling will not return because it has never existed . 
   africa 's problem is that it lives the present too much in nostalgia for a lost childhood paradise . '', 
  it 's longer than that but that 's the `` best '' bit . 
  i also like :  `` the weakness of africa , which has known so many brilliant civilizations on its soil , was for a long time not being able to participate fully in this great cultural mix . 
  [ ... ] youth of africa , do n't listen to those who want to deprive you of your roots and of your identity , want to erase all that is african , all the mystique , the religiousness , the sensitivity , the african mentality . 
  because in order to exchange it is necessary to have something to give , to talk to others , it is necessary to have something to say to them . '', 
  in regards to sarkozy 's words on the french national identity , his words agaisnt islam etc , he 's got a nerve !, 
  smells good does n't it  ? 
  in 2012 , hollande went to dakar too and gave a speech that contradicted all this , thanksfully . 
  i did n't listen to the news much this week nut when i heard about this `` controversy '' i thought it was probably cause they avoid to have two major political leaders in the same plane , in case there 's an accident . 
  i think it was a good move from hollande to invite sarkozy , but i do n't forget his speeches on the africans . 
  also i 'm sure i heard him once use the word `` apartheid '' to refer to the history of the black americans . 
   the report controversially suggests the return of ~ ~ niqabs ~ ~ religious signs , including the veil , in schools, 
  and hollande had prostate surgery in 2011 ... all the medias talked about it for 3 days !!!, 
  ( they were debating transparency ... of course this story is much more important than reporting on the internet spying bill that was passed this week : we did n't hear about it at all in the mainstream media ) . 
  ** france ** ** pm announced the government is planning on a tax reform . 
  ** we are all very sceptic : he still has n't explained what this tax overhaul will be exactly ... is it going to be even only slightly similar to hollande 's promise during the campaign or will it be another disappointment for people who are waiting for a socialist government to vote socialist reforms so that it 's ( crazy idea ! ) ... 
  fairer ? 
  ** peugeot ceo renounces 29 million pension deal after a big controversy ** : philippe varin , boss of peugeot during the last 4 years , was due to receive 310 000 euros each year , which shocks unions , politicians and just ... pretty much all citizens given the thousands of cuttings and sacrifices he asked his employees cause `` times are hard , we have to be competitive '' and so on . 
  however , despite previous cases , followed each time by the promise of a law to prevent that , guess what ... hollande did n't even mention that possibilty . 
  ** france sends more troops to the central african republic ** ** parliament debates the bill on prostitution ** : the bill abolishes the previous law that prohibited soliciting , now clients will be fined ( 1,500 euros ) . 
  so it 's a system similar to the swedish one , and opposed to germany 's take on the issue . 
  ( no solution is perfect in this very complex problem , it has been largely debated during the past weeks ) . 
  the vote takes place i think wednesday . 
  ** sas resistance hero and french ` father of the pill ' dies ** : lucien neuwirth , the gaullist politician responsible for the 1967 legalisation of the contraceptive pill in france , died this week . 
  during the war he escaped death because the bullet that would have killed him struck a coin in his pocket . 
  ** baby loup case : a french court has upheld the controversial sacking of a childcare worker who wore a headscarf to work ** : yep ... this is a five year old case . 
  it 's still not over as the woman will appeal the ruling again ( this is the last time she can do that , then she 'll have to go to the european court , if i understood this right ) . 
  ** education minister launches a plan against bullying in schools ** ** debate on self defense reopens as a jeweller kills the man who came to rob him ** : a similar case occurred in september and started a crazy debate , with millions of people liking a facebook page in support of the jeweller . 
  ** mother of infant found dead on the beach more than a week ago identified ** : a baby girl was found on a beach , deceased . 
  camera footage enabled to find images of a woman with her previously but she was only identified some 10 days later . 
  ** we 're still talking about racism . 
  ** i feel like i forgot some stuff ? 
  username not relevant, 
  ** france ** - ** manhunt after the attacks at bfmtv , lib\u00e9ration and soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ** : on friday morning a man entered the parisian office of the 24hour news tv channel bfm but did n't shoot ( tried to but failed or only wanted to scare people , it 's still not clear : 2 bullets rolled on the floor and he allegedly said `` next time i wo n't miss '' ) . 
  on monday morning he entered the headquarters of the ( left-wing ) newspaper lib\u00e9ration and shot a 23 year-old photographer , who was critically hurt . 
  the man then went to la d\u00e9fense and fired up three times ( in the air ) outside the headquarters of the bank la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale before forcing a man to drive him to les champs elys\u00e9es where the police lost his trace on monday around noon . 
  since then , thousands of policemen protected strategic places in paris and searched for him . 
  gradually it became clear that the 3 cases were related and the images of the suspect ( taken from the surveillance cameras ) were released . 
  dna tests from samples taken at the various sites of the attacks confirmed it was the same and only man but did n't match with any of the dnas on the database of previously convicted/suspected people ( this file was created in 2002 ) . 
  the hunt stopped wednesday evening when the guy was found in a car park in a semi-conscious state ( he attempted suicide ? ), 
  thanks to a witness statement from a man who housed him not long ago . 
  the suspect 's name is abdelhakim dekhar and he was convicted to 4 years of jail for his role in the 1994 rey-maupin case : shootings in paris that killed 4 people and for which dekhar bought the gun ( and maybe was the leader : i 've heard people with different opinions on this previous case . ), 
  dekhar left `` rambling conspiracy letters '' denouncing capitalism , accusing journalists `` of being paid to feed lies to citizens '' . 
  he also wrote about `` a plot aimed at the return of fascism in the media , in banks , in the policy on suburbs '' and decried what he saw as the `` dehumanisation '' of people living in the suburbs . 
  one letter also mentioned libya , syria and the situation in the arab world . 
  after being released from jail in the late 90s he apparently moved to the uk and came back to france in july . 
  since being arrested this week , he has been brought to the hospital and is apparently on a hunger strike now . 
  - ** the ex-hostage who escaped from nigeria last weekend comes back to france and tells his story ** ( this got minor coverage because all the attention was on manhunt ) : francis collomb , the 63 year-old engineer who had been kidnapped nearly a year ago , explained how he prepared his escape . 
  he observed his captors ' praying times and managed to flee , walked 5 kms before finding a moto taxi and going to a police station ... no ransom paid this time . 
  - ** the french football team beats ukraine and is qualified for the world cup !!!, 
  ** that 's a surprise !, 
  ( but most people still despise the players ) . 
  - ** snow ** in the saint etienne region mostly causes traffic problems and 3 deaths . 
  - ** iran : nuclear deal ** - ** death of georges launter , a very famous film director ** as we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of his most famous film : [ `` les tontons flingueurs '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pgpbbj8txy ) . 
  de caunes represents the hey day of french television , on canal plus . 
  he 's back now since september but he 's no longer as funny as he used to be , he presents the show , makes a few jokes but it 's disappointing honestly . 
  there have been several generations of comedians , several groups , operating on canalplus and we miss them . 
  i used to watch mock the week , argumental or never mind the buzzcock in the uk : you have great comedians too . 
  he can actually speak a bit better than that , but it 's way funnier this way . 
  it 's in the article . 
  not `` released '' since he managed to escape . 
  ** france ** - the ** storm ** , called christian here , killed a woman who was swept off the coast . 
  - ** 4 french hostages kidnapped 3 years ago in arlit , niger have been released on tuesday ** .
