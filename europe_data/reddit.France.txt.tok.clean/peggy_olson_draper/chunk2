  president hollande thanked niger president mohamadou issoufou , who he said had obtained the release of the areva workers , with the help of the main negociator : mohamed akotey , a former nigerien minister . 
  they were detained in northern mali . 
  both le monde and afp cited sources close to the negotiations that a ransom of over 20 millions euros had been paid but the government repeatedly insisted that no ransom was paid , and no assault took place . 
  areva also said no ransom had been paid . 
  ( 7 other french nationals are held overseas , in africa and syria . ), 
  - after the former hostages arrived in france , ** far-right leader marine le pen created a big controversy when she suggested that the hostages have been through homeland-style radicalisation ** . 
  she said in an interview that the images had left her feeling `` uncomfortable '' and that she called on the men to explain their `` strange clothing '' and long beards . 
  the mother of one of the former captives , pierre legrand , said the four men had simply agreed to keep their beards and scarves in a gesture of solidarity with other french hostages still held in the region . 
  with controversy mounting , miss le pen later said she regretted her `` clumsy '' remarks , and that she had only meant to criticise their `` exploitation '' by the french and niger governments . 
  - ** two french journalists have been killed in mali yesterday . 
  ** - ** eco-tax ** : following protests in brittany last week , the government suspended the `` eco-tax '' on heavy goods vehicles . 
  but the `` red caps '' movement ( a symbol from a 17th-century revolt against king louis xiv 's fiscal policies ) continued with a huge protest yesterday ( 15000 to 30000 people ) in quimper . 
  mass layoffs have been occurring for months in brittany at poultry producers , swine abattoirs and electronics facilities . 
  carhaix mayor christian troadec said brittany had lost about 8,000 industrial and food production jobs in the past year . 
  - ** hollande said he would n't drop the 75 % tax on salaries over one million euros in the football clubs ** . 
  representatives of the top football clubs have voted to go on strike during the last weekend in november , interrupting the regular ligue 1 football season . 
  this is one of the rare occasions in which hollande does n't change his mind after being pressured by a lobby . 
  - ** a baby has been found living in the truck of a car ** : the mother brought her car to a garage , the mechanic heard weird noises inside the truck and found a little girl , aged between 15 and 23 months old . 
  she was naked , lying in her own excrements , dehydrated and developmentally delayed . 
  she may have been living inside the car since her birth : the mother reportedly told police she had hidden the birth of the child from her partner . 
  their 3 other children have been taken into care . 
  - ** a 5 year-old boy who fell from the pirates of the carribbean ride in disneyland ** on wednesday was in critical condition but is now out of danger . 
  he stood up before the ride was over and was stuck between a boat and the dock . 
  - ** prolific spy novelist g\u00e9rard de villiers , the creator of the top-selling sas series has died ** , aged 83 , in paris . 
  edit : oh and the ** funny one : a lama took the tram in bordeaux !, 
  ** he was stolen from a circus by 5 drunk guys who took him to the tramway . 
  the lama is called serge , just like a famous french singer : serge lama  ( who said it made him laugh ) . 
   an mp from the center-right ump `` clucks '' [ 1 ] while a female green party mp is speaking . 
  once again , the media has a field day with this , ** claiming it to be ** a sign of `` unacceptable sexism amongst politicians . '', 
  * it was * . 
  ( but i agree on the fact that on top of all this debate on sexism , the media should have talked about what she was actually trying to say while being interrupted . ), 
  ** france ** * new secular charter in schools * protests against the retirement reform : not many people , not a lot of media coverage . 
  * the fn ( far-right party ) is rising according to polls , they could hit records in the next municipal elections in spring . 
  * fran\u00e7ois fillon , one of the two leaders of the ump ( right-wing party ) changes his position about the fn , telling his electors to vote for the `` less sectarian '' in case of a choice between the ps ( socialist party ) and the fn ( national front ) . 
  * a jeweller kills a robber , says he acted in self-defense but actually shooted him in the back and his now being prosecuted ... a facebook page created to support him rapidly grew . 
  i do n't know anything about norway politics , i just saw on tv a few hours ago that indeed , that was probably what the results would be . 
  they said that despite the very good economy and the very low unemployment rate , people want change and that erna solberg 's main argument was that the economy needs to be diversified , so that you do n't rely only on petrol . 
  is that true ? 
  also that frp being `` breivik 's party '' , a coalition with them would be refused by other parties , or complicated at least , what do citizens think about that ? 
  [ this ] ( http://rense.com/general54/fake.htm ) is probably why the medias have been very cautious about it . 
  and are called `` what happened in you country this week ? '', 
  ( if you want to search them ) . 
  what about [ super liar ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhxavseplc0 ), 
   i also had no idea that french people joked about us in particular we do . 
  ( this is coming from a french with begium roots so do n't blame me , 
  he sounds like french espion [ oss 117 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwmjtnhrjey ) , a fictional james bond type character in novels and films , but uncultured and arrogant as hell , it 's hilarious !, 
  for france it 's [ marianne ] ( http://www.bonjourdefrance.com/images/marianne-2.gif ) : she 's an allegoric figure who represents the values of the republic . 
  her face is on stamps and statues are displayed in town halls ( some famous females were chosen to represent her , including [ brigitte bardot ] ( http://www.parislike.com/ckfinder/userfiles/images/french_cucul_pics_web/bardot_marianne.jpg ) ( nice huh ? 
  ) , [ catherine deneuve ] ( http://a2.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/139/d7716541676b4b2bb166ea274693f840/l.jpg ) and ... [ an idiot and not classy talk show host ] ( http://wp44.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/evelyne-thomas.jpg ) ) . 
  we also have the [ rooster ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mhexfxwdqoo/ua7oyedzrmi/aaaaaaaattq/3jbtwkn98fw/s1600/coq-gaulois.jpg ) . 
  edit : oh and let 's not forget [ fran\u00e7ois le fran\u00e7ais ] ( http://youtu.be/x9pn0mo0wu4?t=22s ), 
  it 's now on the front page ( posted in r/atheism ) or just google it , they were the 4x400m winners . 
  ( i quickly tried to find the video on youtube to link it and could n't find it earlier ), 
  i just saw that 4 russians kissed each other on the lips on the podium , with the russian tv interpretating it as just friendship but obviously in that context i think we can doubt that , it was good to see !, 
  yes we do !, 
  yes i 've already read your opinion on the other thread , thanks , but that 's still news and i wrote `` allegedly '' . 
  french journalists commenting the championships said she has been living in sweden for several years and is married to a swedish guy , so . . idk . 
  ** france ** : * a young military serviceman was arrested for alledgedly planning an attack on a mosque near lyon . 
  ( he had already attacked another mosque last year ) . 
  * a 16 year-old from trappes allegedly got violently attacked by two men because she was wearing a muslim veil . 
  interestingly this was not covered by mainstream media and i could not find out exactly which type of veil she was wearing ( ie whether she was breaking the law or not ) . 
  * taubira-valls conflict : the minister of justice christiane taubira and the minister of the interior manuel valls disagree on the penal reform : basically they have different political lines , she 's on the left and he 's on the right side of the party and very popular according to the polls . 
  * the government is preparing a new pension reform ... and is preparing the opinion by focusing on the penibilty of some workers , that would be taken in count . 
  * egg crisis : french farmers , angry over the low price of eggs , destroyed thousands of eggs as a way to protest and attract the medias ' attention . 
  * `` devil 's advocate '' jacques verges is dead . 
  he defended some of the most despised criminals and was a controversial man . 
  ( testimonies were , as often after someone dies , rather positive ) . 
  * wimbledon tennis winner marion bartoli announces her retirement , which surprises everyone . 
  * athletics championships in moscow : not many medals for the french athletes ... edit : until today !, 
  * negocations between israel and palestine and of course lots of coverage about the situation in egypt . 
  on another note ( answer in italian , i 'll try to understand ) how do you feel about berlusconi ? 
  well that 's not a bad example actually : from my experience it is much more acceptable to give your kids a spanking in france than in the uk . 
  i 've been there . 
  yes it 's awesome . 
  oops !, 
  i do n't know this series, 
  comic books !!!, 
  tintin , gaston lagaffe , boule et bill , spirou , lucky luke , les schtroupfs ... 
  i did see this before . 
  and the majority of the reactions were the same as yours . 
  i 'd agree that this does probably happen * more * in bad neighbourhoods but it would be a mistake to believe that this does not also happen a lot everywhere else , coming from all ethnicities . 
  yeah i have to recognize that 's how it sounds , i do n't have a solution . 
  i just wanted to express that france has been able to save part of its quality cinema thanks to this politics , it 's sad that it was n't the case in other places , sad for everybody . 
  yeah , i agree , but ... that does n't seem to be possible with the system we 're living in . 
  here 's a parallel : mcdonalds , they are everywhere . 
  people choose to eat there , it 's cheap , it 's unhealthy , the employees are just interchangeable sheep and above all it 's `` generic '' . 
  that 's the problem i have . 
  i do n't have a solution for that , since sadly the majority of people always seem to opt for `` silly '' things rather than for quality ... if at least there was a little more diversity amongst the fast foods and the blockbusters rather than just mcdonald and hollywood ... ( blaming us for trying to preserve cultural richness just sounds wrong , that 's the main idea i wanted to share ) . 
  edit : and maybe the way i phrased it was n't correct : i do n't want to see only european films , i want to see films from all around the world , it 's one great way to discover the complexity of humanity with the little time and money we have on earth , since i know i probably wo n't be able to travel as much as i would like to ... we 're far from it . 
  well a down vote immediately , can you at least say why ? 
  american movies represent about 65 % of the tickets sold in europe , which is quite depressing . 
  france has been able to maintain its 1st position amongst european films , but look at italian cinema for instance : it 's dead now , is n't it really sad ? 
  we also have cannes which is the major event that promotes what cinema should be about ... internationally . 
  is n't it just a little bit sane if we fear blockbusters rubbing out all the cultural diversity out there ? 
  watch 2 days in paris and 2 days in new york  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgpczufegam, 
  oh i did n't know that , well that 's okay for me . 
  well , i 've known some rude germans then . 
  ( really they would show up maybe not 30 minutes before but 15 ) . 
  mmm not exactly : french history teachers do have trouble teaching certain chapters but i do n't think they give up at all .
