  that 's not the same green though . 
  i 'll try , but it 's not easy to pick only 10 songs . 
  [ indochine - l'aventurier ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il1s4wp6dly ) [ images - les d\u00e9mons de minuit ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_zxdnzjzvk ) [ d\u00e9but de soir\u00e9e - nuit de folie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xkwvycww1m ) [ partenaire particulier ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropop4ywgmk ) [ myl\u00e8ne farmer - sans contrefa\u00e7ons ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d03wjogoq1k ) [ rita mitsouko - marcia baila ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6fvlfogto8 ) [ jean-jacques goldman - je te donne ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=493r05ifnsi ) [ marc lavoine - elle a les yeux revolver ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejykrdwpn6s ) [ peter & sloane - besoin de rien envie de toi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjwayb8vlk ) [ cookie dingler - femme lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaqrwmacmw4 ) i feel like a wedding dj , 
   we must have surely taken words from african languages . 
  none come to mind . 
  [ loads of french words ] ( http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/annexe:mots_fran%c3%a7ais_d%e2%80%99origine_arabe ) have an arabic origin . 
  my favourite is ramdam . 
  the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise would like to replace the english word '' * buzz * '' with '' * ramdam * '' , but it 's not even a french word in the first place !, 
  what makes you feel that way ? 
  funny commercials ? 
  ( once upon a time ... ) : i believe this educational cartoon was also broadcasted in a lot of countries . 
  they use the same characters to teach kids about history , space , the working of the body ... [ kaamelott ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaamelott ) , an hilarious tv show about the arthurian legend . 
  [ j'irai dormir chez vous ] ( http://www.jiraidormirchezvous.com/ ) ( i 'll sleep at your house ) : a tv documentary about a globetrotter who travels the world , meets new people from different cultures and kind of crash at their place . 
  the guy is nice and funny , it 's fun to watch . 
  the survey was about other europeans tourists . 
   no less than 42 % of europeans surveyed said that ** of all european nationalities ** they found russians most annoying during their holiday . 
  yes , but they wear socks with sandals !, 
   fucking amazing rugby they ** used ** to play . 
  :( i 'm all sad and nostalgic now . 
  but you still ca n't beat us !, 
  ( last game was a draw if i remember well ), 
  pretty close !, 
  it 's baguette , 
  yeah , [ french music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw5d_w-jpp4 ) ... 
  ** tldr ** : iama request : un moniteur d'auto-\u00e9cole , 
  where ( and when ) did you get your license ?!? 
   as / u/adolfstalin ( that username ! ), 
  said , you use your blinkers to show that you want to change lanes and are about to do it . 
  if you do it too late , it 's pointless , they can see you 're changing lanes . 
  i did n't know that story , thanks !, 
  i 'm ashamed now , because i never realized what the song was about ( i guess i never really listened the lyrics ) . 
  yeah , 31 \u00b0 c at the moment . 
  i wan na go jogging but it 's too hot , it makes me extra lazy . 
  i guess i 'll keep basking in the sun . 
  life is hard my friend ... 
  no , it 's a different serie . 
  it started with austria ( [ what is the best thing about austria ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jvjzq/series_what_is_the_best_thing_about_austria/ ) ) , then [ germany ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1k0v6l/series_what_is_the_best_thing_about_germany/ ) and [ switzerland ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kcjhq/serieswhat_is_the_best_thing_about_switzerland/ ) . 
  however op should have keep the initial name , it would have been clearer that it 's a different serie . 
  even french ? 
  i think you need to sit down and have a cup of tea , you do n't look well at all . 
  i 'm really concerned about you . 
  bern is a capital ? 
  ** toulouse , france ** : the city played a big role in the history of aviation . 
  the [ aeropostale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a%c3%a9ropostale_%28aviation%29 ) company was founded there , and famous pilots such as mermoz and saint-exup\u00e9ry opened air routes to africa and then south america . 
  nowadays , with airbus and eads , toulouse is the european center the aerospace industry . 
  keep your brown bread , peasant , we have * baguettes * . 
  the \u010ceburekai look like empanadas . 
  what do you put inside ? 
  thank you for this interesting and prejudice-free comment !, 
  it really adds something to the discussion ( what was this thread about again ? 
  ah i remember now : typical houses ) . 
   era capaz de capir casi todo que has escrito `` capir '' is italian , no ? 
  i think it 's entender in spanish  and it 's the same for me : with the french and spanish i know , i can understand a good part of written portuguese ( or italian by the way ) . 
  but when they speak ... 
  the word `` ordinateur '' does n't have any other meaning than modern computer . 
  it comes from the latin word ordinator , one who ordains . 
  til ( thanks to your question :d ) the story of this word is quite interesting :  in its application to computing , it was coined by the professor of philology jacques perret in a letter dated 16 april 1955 , in response to a request from ibm france , who believed the word calculateur was too restrictive in light of the possibilities of these machines ( this is a very rare example of the creation of a neologism authenticated by dated letter . ), 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ordinateur ), 
  that 's great !!, 
  i can not understand or even guess a word in polish ... :(, 
   ~ ~ im ~ ~ perfect ftfy , 
  and that 's when i realized that i only knew romanic languages ... , 
  ** victor hugo **, 
  sometimes we say `` tennis '' instead of `` baskets '' for sneakers . 
  and `` jogging '' for sweatpants , 
  we have plenty of words like that in french !, 
  * one of my friends favorite is fashion , used as an adjective and not a noun , as in `` this outfit is very fashion '' * tennisman , rugbyman - tennis player and rugby player * baby-foot - table-football * and a lot of - ing words : relooking ( makeover ) , brushing ( blow dry ) , planning ( schedule ) , building ( skyscraper ) ... 
  i 'm not sure how to explain it because it 's just natural to me  but i would say that when you 're talking about ingredients or components you must use '' \u00e0 '' or `` au '' ( = \u00e0 le ) , which means here `` made of/with '' . 
  for example : g\u00e2teau au chocolat ( chocolate cake ) , but also savon \u00e0 la vanille ( vanilla soap ) or sirop \u00e0 la menthe ( mint-flavored cough syrup ) . 
  if it 's not clear enough , you should ask / r/french , you will receive better explanation there !, 
  le plus important c'est de se faire comprendre  '' \u00e0 '' or `` au '' as in omelette au fromage means made of/with . 
  how do you know that ? 
  did you check their ids ? 
   i ca n't think of any countries that have stereotypically beautiful women but ugly men one of my ( girl ) friend spent a semester in finland and told me it was a nightmare : all the girls were pretty but the guys were ugly . 
  maybe it 's just her , but i kinda agreed when she showed me some pics . 
  as a straight woman , i 'm not really into big blonde guys . 
  i voted for spain , mostly because of [ this man ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lptgaek.jpg ) , 
  that 's what i thought  thanks !, 
  what does picha-mole mean ? 
  i saw a video of brazilian commentators almost dead laughing when talking about a french rugby player named picamoles , i guess his name is funny in portuguese ... 
  ** france ** * the tour de france started yesterday . 
  as always the media coverage will be 50 % about the race , 50 % about doping . 
  * bernard tapie , a french tycoon , is investigated for the 403 million $ he received in 2008 after an arbitration decision to settle a dispute with bank credit lyonnais . 
  it could be a problem for sarkozy as tapie is one of his supporters and some people think that tapie 's ties with sarkozy 's circle influenced the government decision to turn to a private arbitration tribunal . 
  * french assembly is about to debate the government 's 2014 budget . 
  14 billion euros in cuts are announced as an attempt to reduce the public deficit to 3 % by 2015 . 
  did you give us any points ? 
  it might because it was created by [ marcel bezen\u00e7on ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurovision_song_contest#cite_ref-1 ) who spoke french , and the 1st edition took place in switzerland . 
  thanks !, 
  i think you 're lucky if the most interesting thing on the news in your country was `` the cat killer affair '' , 
  the cat killer ??? 
  could you explain that ? 
  i do n't know the situation in the rest of europe , but in france almost everyone in the church ( except the priest and the altar boys ) is a woman ( the helpers , people in charge of bible study and catechism ... ) . 
  if i make as much money as my husband and i love my job , i would have zero problem if he decides to work part-time or stay at home to take care of our children . 
  the same for most of my female friends . 
  but i can not name one man i know who would accept that . 
  thank you . 
  i would n't mind in a documentary , but as i said , i would hate it for a fiction . 
  the narrator 's voice is too distracting for me to actually listen the original voices .
