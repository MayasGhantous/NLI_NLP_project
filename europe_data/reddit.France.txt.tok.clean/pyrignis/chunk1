i guess your sentence could have been read in two way : efficient as a president , psycopath in everyday life or efficient at beeing psycopath . 
  i first read the latter . 
  i was about to get a goodwin point ... 
  modern-day olympics games ? 
  political opinions aside , hollande is good at synthesising views of a group of people . 
  this kept him secretay of the french socialist party around 10 years . 
  however france is a very presidential system and the president is expected to take the initative and lead the reforms in selected directions . 
  sarkosy took it too far and the reaction was to elect someone with the opposite temper . 
  i feel he would be more fitted for a much more parlementary regime . 
  le pen is an extreme-right and euro-hating politician . 
  she wowed to do everything in her power to undermine eu from within the ep . 
  of course she is trying to make as much fuss as possible over this . 
  on the other hand she is under investigation for tax evasion for herself and her party ... 
   see you coming , you all  :-[ . 
  this is / r/europe , the `` liberty fry '' folks are on / r/murrica . 
  how , right , forgot about that, 
  counting everything , i still think france has both easternmost and wersternmost territories . 
  taking longitudes as a reference , [ wallis and futuna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallis_and_futuna ) are the esternmost , and [ french polynesia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_polynesia ) the westernmost . 
  if we take the date change as a reference , wallis and futuna are on the extreme west but [ new caledonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_caledonia ) might not be the esternmost . 
  for shouthermost , [ both ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_claims_in_antarctica ) the united kingdom and france have claim on the south pole . 
  and although they whent there first , [ the norwegian claim does not go all the way to the south pole . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_claims_in_antarctica#mediaviewer/file:antarctic_region.png ), 
  france has larges drugs companies which hire a lot of people in france . 
  theses companies negotiate with the anses ( read french fda ) the conditions and pricing of drugs sold on the market by constantly threatening to move the production out of france . 
  since lobbies have the upper hand over general interest they get to sell their product free of generics competition . 
  also the pharmacists are the ones supposed to switch the patients to generics but they have a flat rate on all medications : if they advise a cheaper generic to their patient they are rewarded with less income and more risk ( the occasional generic 's nonacceptance by the patient ) . 
  it might very well still be . 
  but the industries located there are no longer what is fueling our economy . 
  the wine may very well be underrated but the soil that usually gives the best wines are the ones that could n't be used for cereals . 
  it needs steepness and rocky soil , which is usually bad for most crops . 
  this is a proposal . 
  russie blanche ( white russia ) did n't last very long . 
  yep , and seeing the german struggle that much made the french do the same and founded the gign , also featured in cs . 
  also gendarmes \u2260 military police . 
  military police is a part of the military that watch over military personnel to keep them from doing illegal stuff ( like bringing back drugs from afghanistan ) . 
  gendarmes as similar to sheriff 's staff in usa . 
  the do about the same job as the police do but they have military status and thus sleep in their quarters , not in civilian housing , unlike police . 
  this could be a munich ~ ~ 1968 ~ ~ 1972 joke too , you guys did n't impress then . 
  how , you fell for it . 
  it 's alright though , the germans have already complain about their policeman being not as bad . 
  numerous or not , `` neebs '' that do n't speak english are now called `` russians '' . 
  in another moba it 's `` brazillians '' . 
  if they speak english then they 're called trolls . 
  i thought that too for a long time but actually notre-dame de paris and the louvre seem to have more visitors . 
  however the number of person that come to the champ-de-mars ( or elsewhere ) to see the eiffel tower from below might be higher . 
  i think the size of the line turns down most people . 
  ( ps : pro tip : use the stairs !, 
  it 's cheaper , there is much less waiting , you can brag about it , and it 's much less crowded for about the same view . 
  however last time i checked the stairs for the 3rd floor where closed ), 
  well then they should have called it a `` top 48 places you should visit in europe '' / `` most visited cultural tourist attractions in europe '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , i know disneyworld is on a different consumer base but , assuming it 's trip advisor 's title it is at least misleading . 
  i think trip advisor may have their number wrong . 
  as sad for european cultures as it may be , disneyland paris ( ex eurodisney ) is the [ most visited tourist attraction ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20120406-disneyland-paris-europes-top-tourist-destination ) in europe ... 
  title said they where muslim so it has to be a muslim related problem , right !, 
  i 'm willing to bet most of them are not going to the mosque and are as muslim as i am chistian . 
  but they do have colored faces so it 's enough ... 
  wow , did n't know / r/europe was so racist/xenophobic ... 
  maybe that 's silly but i did n't know he was famous outside of france . 
  let 's try this map for `` any language other than english and your native language '' and you 'll be last any time . 
  get it straight : american and british do n't like the way they are welcomed ( in paris mostly ) . 
  but since they make a large majority on reddit and in media generally speaking ... 
  that a big pile of shit : 1 . 
  yeah , they stayed out , i guess the brits have trouble loosing their pounds  2 . 
  protectionism vs freetrade is a long debated issue , jumping a bit fast on conclusion here . 
  uk has ue 's 3rd economy , great . 
  a bigger economy is n't stronger if it is n't on the same page . 
  a shift in dynamic is indeed needed but actually blocked by the uk who , as the 3dr economy in ue wants to keep the big countries in control 5 . 
  again , most of the ue is in nato for military purposes and with uk having a different agenda from most of the union it does not makes diplomacy stronger and tends to weaken it . 
  this particular newspaper is wholly held by its employees , to prevent a hostile take-over . 
  the `` money on the side '' is to let them publish 2 years without selling a single print . 
  they do tend to go hard on everyone and need protections , in case of trials or anything else . 
  their journalist are also the best paid written journalists in france . 
  delaware did n't make it on the list ... 
  yes , most jobs are indeed full-time jobs . 
  and it might very well mean a better life for those who get their `` 0 hour '' job . 
  what i 'm saying is that if you give 4 `` 0 hour '' with an average of 10 worked hours instead of a single full-time job it gets recorded as 4 times more effective in unemployment stats for the similar work effort produced . 
  this can quickly grow to a sizable difference in unemployment figures across countries , even with a low number of jobs done by `` 0 hour '' contract employees . 
  giving someone a zero hour contract might take him out of the unemployed stats , it might even give an economical boost to the business sectors that use it a lot , but it does n't always get him above the poverty level . 
  everyone can have its opinion on the mater but the number ca n't really be compared . 
  this applies in some way to the german mini-jobs . 
  for it to be more spiky you would need more reports . 
  yes the 60 % crude price drop might not equal a 60 % gas price drop but i do see a tendency to have price go up as fast as crude but down much lower than crude . 
  i 'm actually surprised . 
  i 'm used to a lot worse . 
  ok , makes sense now , thank you !, 
  well , now that it has been mentioned i feel dumb . 
  waiting for my other questions to feel dumber . 
  i 'm sorry but i did n't catch the reference . 
  where does it comes from ? 
  edit : also who is the man in austria or slovakia and why the glove in belgium ? 
  ... with aam that have a kill ratio of 10 % when firing at jets with no early warnings . 
  got ta have a lot of them missile . 
  germany has almost no power projection tools but france sure has , italy in a way too ( although they are waiting for f35 for their carrier ) . 
  i do n't think the `` auld alliance '' has much effect today ( except for me , i like to keep the gentleman 's rivalry going ), 
  for example for robberies i am pretty sure insurances policies have more to do than anything else . 
  if the insurance require a police testimony people will start to report thief even though police as now way of/intention to investigate on it . 
  indeed , lots of the refugees wanting to go to uk are in concentration camps in calais . 
  and since the camps are full , france started to re-enforce border control on the italian border ... 
  it is indeed good news . 
  and if you take a moment to hear what the greek and their government has to say is that they need to adjust their taxation to have more equity .
