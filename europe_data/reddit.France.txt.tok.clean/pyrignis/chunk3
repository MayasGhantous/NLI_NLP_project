  / opinion, 
  i ca n't seem to be able to find it ... 
  they are multiples way of judging what nationality a company ( or subgroup ) is . 
  the shares is one thing but you would n't call seat or \u0160koda germans because vw own them . 
  in this case it is the result of the merger of a french and a german helicopter builder . 
  one game that has been mentioned in this thread is paradox interactive 's victoria ii . 
  it is a `` grand strategy '' game covering the years 1836 to 1936 . 
  your wwi experience wo n't be the historical one but the types of diverting interest , alliances and scramble for africa that lead there are particularly interesting . 
  this game has quite a steep learning curve though . 
  usa : * 50 states , plus some dependencies ( guam , puerto rico ... ) * 3 144 counties ( average of 62 per state ; min3 ; max 254 ) or equivalent france : * 22 regions ( merging to 13 region will happen january 1st 2016 ) and oversea territory under various regimes . 
  * 101 d\u00e9partements ( as those seen on the map ) . 
  this include part of our overseas territories, 
  to have the general idea about it maybe the middle-school books of history . 
  if you can get your hand on those . 
  * ^ we ^ name ^ the ^ school ^ years ^ as ^ a ^ countdown ^ to ^ graduation , ^ so ^ 6 ^ \u00e8me ^ is ^ 11years-old ^ classes . 
  * * 6 ^ \u00e8me : history up to ~ 1000 * 5 ^ \u00e8me : history from ~ 1000 to 1700 * 4 ^ \u00e8me : 1700 to 1899 * 3 ^ \u00e8me : 20th century high school history is less about french history and more focus-based . 
  in the meantime the wikipedia articles in english and french are quite large : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_france https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/histoire_de_france, 
  maybe it 's just me but i feel like all the lager tend to taste somewhat the same . 
  idem for pilsener . 
  however i have no trouble identifying the taste of a chimay from a carmeliettriple or a maredsous for example . 
  i had stumbled upon this article a while ago and when i wanted to add my sources , they were n't many i could find . 
  i have since spent the afternoon time reading upon that and it seems that this guy indeed is quite controversial . 
  well , my informations are out of date but the catobar configuration was once planned for the `` prince of whales '' . 
  well the flanders part was more for the `` same culture '' requirement . 
  but yeah , walloon beers are great too !, 
  same culture and great beers i would have picked flanders . 
  i mean every country has some good beers but belgium is the one that stand out for the number of high quality , non-microbrewed , beers !, 
  me too . 
  have n't been there but the idea i have of it is good . 
  also i 've had positive feedback on how the politics ( corruption , labor management and social security system ) works . 
  well they better be !, 
  with such an expensive program the planes ought to be better than the ones they are replacing . 
  the question is whether they are better that the one that are ( and will be ) competing with him . 
  you guys ordered the `` b '' * vertical take-off and landing * version for the royal navy ~ ~ ( and probably the `` c '' * carrier-capable * version for the planned 2nd carrier ) ~ ~ but also the `` a '' version for the raf . 
  the stealth of the f35 is very dubious . 
  1st off it is only stealthy for radar waves coming in front of him or directly behind him . 
  it is not stealthy ( or as much as any 4th generation plane ) from the side , the ground below him or an awac over him . 
  2nd it is only stealthy for certain types of radar . 
  while airplane-mounted radar ca n't see him ( if the angle is good for the f35 ) but special types of ground radar are not impacted by his stealthy features . 
  the tail-stealthiness is good to prevent lock-on from a chasing plane . 
  this can however be countered by having another plane located where he can lock him then feeding the information to the chasing plane and missiles ( at least the su35 , rafale or eurofighter can do that ) . 
  edit : added source http://www.ausairpower.net/apa-2009-01.html#moztocid93619 http://www.scienpress.com/upload/jcm/vol%204_1_9.pdf, 
  the ability to shoot behind you is not given by the helmet but by missile guidance control , radar , and inter-plane/missile data transmission . 
  the rafale was the 1st plane to be able to secure such a `` kill '' in airborne practice in 2007 . 
  most 4 + + generation airplanes have upgrades planned to add such capability . 
  the helmet might be revolutionary but this is n't an example of it . 
   finland : most tourists is it outgoing per capita ? 
  or am i missing something ? 
  france : the republic on which the sun never sets . 
  president wine ?? 
  wow , yes this has to be austria 's most iconic brand !, 
  yes but edp is not famous outside of portugal . 
  even if the whole of europe was to depend on portuguese electric export nobody would know about them ... 
  maybe because spain , france and italy are large enough to have non-english speaking social website and less of a habit to use english . 
  what about spain ? 
  portugal ? 
  romania ? 
  i have never heard of kalev , tallink nor laima . 
  what do they do ? 
  nice of you to give airbus to france , 
  every single french tv except the national tv and arte are owned by billionaire who actually do intervene on the programs aired . 
  while one should n't give a blank check to anyone , i think it 's unfair to spit on the less compromised tv of them all . 
  i do n't speak german well enough to understand that though . 
  could someone make a wrap-up ? 
  auld alliance was thrown out of the window last week , 29-18 ... 
  ... and the turkish are the only one who believe so . 
  turkey will invade syria in a short while anyways . 
  yes , country with a somewhat continuous state history dating from before 1200 are : * ** japan ** is a weird mess but seems to have had emperors dating back -600 . 
  * ** china ** had some unity dating back -3000 , officially use -221 as the founding year of their country but there is n't really continuity in state . 
  * ** ethiopia ** is hard to really date but it seems to have been a somewhat unified power dating back -2000 . 
  the abyssinia rules dates circa 1137 . 
  * ** san marino ** founded in 301 but only formally recognized as independent in the 1600s * ** france ** can be traced back to 843 * ** austria ** from 976 * ** denmark ** to the 10th century * ** hungary ** to 1001 then ** portugal ** in 1143 ( and ** mongolia ** in 1206 ), 
  i was curious about the `` oldest continuously serving navy in the world '' part so here is why other country do n't contend : * england : no standing navy until 1660 * denmark : no standing navy until 1510 * spain : navy founded in the 13 ^ th century * france : remains unclear but probably did not have a standing navy before spain . 
  most other country where founded after the portuguese navy , for example : siam/thailand : country founded out of the khmer empire in 1431 china : took over by the qing dynasty in 1644 italy : united in 1861, 
  yep , if only i had been writing the versailles treaty the czech republic would be on the shore of the brandenburg bay , 
  well , there is a difference between legal immigrants , refugees , asylum seekers and illegal migrants . 
  whether or not you decide to put them all in the same bag is a different issue . 
  well , police investigations have found that only a couple of the offenders where likely to be refugees . 
  downvote but no response , here are some sources : http://thinkprogress.org/world/2016/02/16/3749911/cologne-refugee-attacks/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12130843/eu-leaders-no-link-between-cologne-sex-attacks-and-migrant-crisis.html http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/cologne-sex-attacks-only-three-out-of-58-men-arrested-for-new-years-eve-assaults-are-refugees-34453752.html https://www.rt.com/news/332505-cologne-sex-attacks-refugees/, 
  yep , i think you got it right . 
  it looks like occitan is labeled as `` pro '' for provencal . 
  however , is rm for romandy ? 
  thanks . 
  i guess i was n't using the right keywords . 
  for russia the only thing i 've found is a natural gas contract with china that is not effective yet . 
  for venezuela i 've only found proposal to trade in euro but no actual deal in euros ( opec trades only in dollar ) . 
  such as ? 
  the only case i know of international petroleum sales being valued in something other than dollar is the `` food for oil '' un program that ended in 2003 . 
  there could be others though and if you have any specific cases i 'd be glad to hear it . 
  france has a much more restrictive way of calling what is a city from its suburbs . 
  paris is what was inside the paris walls in 1870 . 
  saint-denis , montreuil , or vincennes for example would be called paris if it was in england . 
  for that reason when comparing french city sizes and population with other country ( at least anglo-saxon ones ) , you 're better of by comparing metropolitan area . 
  op has the numbers and you see that london has only 50 % more people if you consider the metropolitan area while paris size is increased 6 fold . 
  except in the ( former ) soviet union . 
  there could be `` leftovers '' from it in some military for example . 
  i feel like the title does n't summarize the content of the article at all . 
  the article is about the progressive loss of influence and appeal of france compared to its neighbor , not about them being dispensable . 
  all that follow will have to be opinion . 
  with that out of the way , i 'll explain my personal analysis .
