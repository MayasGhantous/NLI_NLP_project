  you 're kidding , they 've been managing it for all that time . 
  the uk basically use calais as their refugees camp and that 's the fault of the french ? 
  & gt ; france relies on the uk to protect the french border the other side of the channel . 
  however , we manage our side fine . 
  you 're a troll . 
  first , you do n't , you have illegal immigrants too . 
  second , your side protects france from whom ? 
  illegal immigrants from iceland ? 
  i think france should stop spending money on the migrants in calais . 
  let them leave , not our problem . 
  if you want it to be our problem , get into schengen . 
  that 's covered in the agreement . 
  it 's not embarrassing for france , it 's not our problem who wants to leave . 
  it 's our problem who enters . 
  it 's more embarrassing for the uk because they rely on another country for their border protection . 
  it would be a better solution for us to provide them with small boats and let them do as they want . 
  cheaper and they leave . 
  if the uk is n't interested in the protection of the eu borders , then i do n't see why we should be interested in theirs . 
  let the migrants in calais get to the uk , after all it 's their problem . 
  we have similar things , just not exact copies . 
  it has nothing to do with religion . 
  well , it 's just because of charleroi then . 
  fries , belgian beers , fricadelles ( [ for those who speak french ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpioc2uysco ) , yes it 's a joke , i hope ) . 
  plus , they got charleroi . 
  there was some jokes in france during the last crisis in greece , that europe would do a liposuction ( remove greece ) . 
  france got it because they let germany have the ecb . 
  it does n't only carries negatives , it also carries $ 3bn . 
  because the government was/is under pressure to get work for the naval construction works . 
  yes , but there 's also the gripen and eurofighter . 
  unless that $ 6bn deal is guaranteed unless the mistral thing goes through , it 's all wind . 
  weighting an already signed and built $ 3bn deal versus a potential $ 6bn one is n't evident . 
   maybe because a rafale is 5-6 times more expensive than an f-16 . 
  catalog price possibly ( although it 's difficult to say since there is n't public reliable data about prices ) , but in reality you need fewer rafale for the same job . 
  and if they 're not in that market , they could take gripens . 
  well it 's the title of the article . 
  that being said i 'd still have removed the french part , but i can understand leaving it . 
  it means that money sitting around grows in value . 
  therefore , any investment must be really profitable to be worthwhile . 
  say i have a project and need investment . 
  say the inventor thinks the risk is worth a 3 % return more than the risk-less standard ( storing the money ) . 
  if there 's 1 % inflation , my project needs to guarantee 2 % in value gain to be worth it . 
  if there 's 1 % deflation , it needs to do 4 % . 
  so deflation increases interest rates , reduces investment . 
  in general it 's good for the rich , since one makes value from deflation by storing large amounts of money . 
  and it 's bad for the poor because the reduced investment means less work . 
  as if the flemish could speak french ... 
  worst is that he 's coming back . 
  right , but obviously it 's a lot more complicated than that since the contract is already signed , manufactured , and so close to delivery that russian military were on training on the ships . 
  that 's the point . 
  you can try in several languages , nobody ever considers the current plug design to be a safety issue . 
  i doubt you 'll find many french people now supporting paying 2 or 3 billions euros just to avoid passing off some allies who ca n't be arsed to propose any fair financial solution . 
  look at the french media . 
  just these last 2 days , it 's all about [ reducing social help to families ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/09/29/coup-de-rabot-generalise-sur-les-allocations-familiales_4496535_823448.html ) , [ the national debt officially increasing above $ 2000bn ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2014/09/30/97002-20140930filwww00066-la-dette-de-la-france-creve-officiellement-le-plafond-des-2000-milliards-d-euros.php ) , [ how national debt made the 1789 revolution ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/histoire/2014/09/30/31005-20140930artfig00362-comment-la-dette-publique-a-provoque-la-revolution-de-1789.php ) , [ do you think that france will one day manage to reduce its debt ( 82 % say no ) ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/videos/economie/2014/09/30/11007-20140930qcmwww00150-pensez-vous-que-la-france-parviendra-un-jour-a-reduire-sa-dette.php ) , [ retired people protesting to keep their allowance ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/09/30/les-retraites-ne-veulent-pas-etre-une-variable-d-ajustement-pour-le-gouvernement_4498173_823448.html ) , [ pharmacians protesting laws that decrease their revenues ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/09/30/les-professions-liberales-de-sante-dans-la-rue_4498115_823448.html ) , [ unemployment will get worse in 2015 ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/emploi/article/2014/09/29/le-chomage-s-aggravera-en-2015-selon-l-unedic_4496576_1698637.html ) , [ should young people leave france to succeed ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/discussion/2014/03/11/les-jeunes-doivent-ils-quitter-la-france-pour-reussir_4380959_3224.html ) , [ $ 2bn cut to national health insurance ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2014/09/30/coup-d-arret-a-la-reduction-des-deficits-de-la-securite-sociale_4496874_1651302.html ) , [ public tv will start bringing back ads ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2014/09/30/20004-20140930artfig00403-france3-va-tester-la-publicite-apres-20heures-en-region.php ) . 
  i think the difference is the amount of money . 
  meaning there 's no european country were the electrical accidents due to the plugs are higher for anyone to say that another design would be better . 
  except everyone in other countries must learn not only english , but a second foreign language too . 
  at least we have a common voltage and frequency . 
  forcing to have a fuse in the plug is the most ridiculous aspect of the uk plug . 
  i guess it 's made necessary by the bad electrics in the average uk house . 
  they 're very heavy and large , and more expensive . 
  the devices that do n't need the earth still have a large plug with a plastic pin . 
  and honestly they do look ugly . 
  and i 've never seen any statistical evidence that they were safer . 
  honestly , the shape is fine , although a bit clunky , but forcing every single device to have a earth pin and a fuse is ridiculous . 
  here 's an example , the samsung phone charger : [ euro ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/31lgiuoog5l._sx425_.jpg ) , [ uk ] ( http://images.mobilefun.co.uk/graphics/240pixelp/genuine-samsung-galaxy-uk-mains-charger-with-usb-cable-2-amp-black-p39164-240.jpg ) there 's one thing which is nice though , it 's that most wall plugs have an individual switch , but it does n't have anything to do with the plug design . 
  you could see it the other way around . 
  they 're bigger , heavier , and more expensive , for no better result statistically . 
  i do n't . 
  these people are not me , and i feel that the answer of the state to this phenomenon is n't embarrassing . 
  apparently in france the average is 6h49 . 
  but well , that 's an average . 
  we do have different average work hours though , since people come to the office up to 9am , but it 's common for office workers to stay until 6pm or 7pm ( or more exceptionally ) . 
  well if they ask nicely ... 
  well it does n't always work so well because i know that several friends in germany have had problems with it a few times . 
  if i eventually move there ( i plan to , temporarily probably ) , that 's something that would piss me off i think ( if my neighbors did that ) . 
  waking up the neighbors at 7am is n't acceptable , in particular on the week-end . 
  even during the week , you do n't know if everybody works that day or if they start work like you do . 
  it 's similar to france about that really , except here it 's common to wake up after 7am , especially if you do n't have kids . 
  and we do finish work later though . 
  still , 7am is a bit early imo to wake up the neighbors . 
  and that 's for the week . 
  if someone regularly made noise early in the morning on the week-end , that would be war . 
  so that leaves saturday morning or end of afternoon only for any serious task . 
  that 's pretty restrictive . 
  also that 's pretty dumb . 
  lots of people would be way more pissed at someone making noise at 7am than on a saturday or sunday afternoon . 
  when are you supposed to be able to make noise ? 
  my brain defaulted to dating opportunities . 
  at the same time , things are n't classified by the rough idea that the category name gives . 
  aircraft manufacturing is in the metallurgy category ( both in france and germany ) . 
  see , you got more mitigated in your view . 
  that 's what i meant indeed . 
  they weighted some arguments against others , and wanting independence just for the principle was a relevant argument one way . 
  indeed they decided that the total was n't worth it , and that 's fine , but it does n't mean that wanting independence just for the sake of it was irrelevant , or ridiculous . 
  it also means that you could actually see some reviving of the independent movement in the future , when the equation changes . 
  for instance if the promises made one way are n't followed . 
  simple , there are some which want to go to france , some want to continue to england . 
  in calais , you only see the latter . 
  relevant , and interesting : http://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/ ( i also recommend the rest of the articles ) . 
  also , i imagine it mostly has to do with the language they can speak .
