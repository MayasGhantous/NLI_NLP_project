what i am talking about is that this vote will allow other countries to think not only about internal immigration within europe but also their external borders . 
  for years it was almost taboo to even consider or talk about the fact that outside immigration in europe has been more costly than it has been saving . 
  norway , sweden , france , belgium , swizerland , england and germany are all facing these issue with external immigration problems . 
  i do . 
  i think though , rather i hope that its a sign that open borders and lax immigration policies are on their way out for the rest of europe because of the reasons i explained above . 
  i 'm glad they are trying to push for this . 
  hopefully this will also push the rest of the european countries ( not necessarily in the eu ) to pass similar restrictions on immigration as many countries are already overburdened by the number of immigrants coming from africa , especially in relation to increases in crime , and costs to take in these immigrants . 
  france , and england have huge problems with respect to immigrants and the time is now to reverse these trends . 
  europe has no obligation to take these people in , especially when they do n't want to assimilate or integrate into european society . 
  this is what ends up happening : http://i.imgur.com/ktp2gth.png, 
  marine le pen said this about a few months ago . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqyhj8fx2rq still rings very true to the immigration issues and calls for using the same policy that australia uses . 
  yep ... only the daily mail has this information ... http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10417222/illegal-immigrants-cost-taxpayer-more-than-4000-a-head-each-year.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/immigration-from-outside-europe-cost-120-billion.html http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/10/non-eu-immigration-unemployment http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/european-immigrants-contribute-5bn-to-uk-economy-but-noneu-migrants-cost-118bn-9840170.html http://news.sky.com/story/1366933/eu-migrants-pay-in-more-than-they-take-study, 
  well if well to do americans and other western folks get deported from the uk and hate preachers , literal terrorists , and benefit leaches get to stay , not much you can really do . 
  uk policies are backwards as fuck and they seem to care very little out ethnic brits . 
  what this says is that inter european immigration is good , which i think is an ok positive outcome . 
  outside of europe , per the article , it costs a whole lot more than what they get in taxes . 
  if you got rid of all the immigration from outside of europe , you effectively cut costs by billions of pounds per year . 
  this is a symptom of a larger problem . 
  these immigrants want to go to the uk because of the insane benefits program that is offered . 
  easiest way to reduce this mess is to slash the benefits and stop handing it out like free candy . 
  in a nation with a ever increasing debt-to-gdp ratio , you 'd think they would , i dunno , start getting rid of programs that are costing literally billions of pounds with no return on investment . 
  immigrants from outside of the uk cost the taxpayer billions and do not contribute in returns in taxes nearly as much as the benefits they sap . 
  seems like all you can do is apply labels to people as some sort of argument or excuse . 
  i 'm not sure you could even hold a conversation . 
  my bad . 
   misanthropic that 's a big word for you to use , shame you have no clue how to use it . 
  i love europeans and european culture . 
  i highly dislike islam and cultures originating from africa as they are extremely toxic and incapable of sustaining liberty and fraternity . 
  i would also suggest that you do not reply to someone if the only thing you can do is bring up their previous comments . 
  it shows how little you can actually sustain a conversation . 
  bravo !, 
  you should read closely . 
  i stipulated immigration from outside of europe is a net-loss on the economy which is true . 
  studies have shown however immigrants from within europe , aka from other european countries provide a net benefit . 
  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-eu-immigration vs outside of europe . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/immigration-from-outside-europe-cost-120-billion.html i bet you that german study does not differentiate between the two for this very reason . 
  i 'd like to see a differentiated study from germany that would show the same result . 
   how is this to be accomplished ? 
  it simply is not an easy solution . 
  you come up with `` answers '' that are not really answers . 
  yours answers are on the same level as `` i 'd like to solve world hunger '' yes that 's fine , but how ? 
  you do not answer the how and while we can not answer that the only possibility is immigration , otherwise our pension system will break apart and with that our society . 
  obviously it 's not a simple solution . 
  you first have to figure out why are families not producing as many children and find the root cause and attempt a solution from that angle . 
  a variety of reasons could very well include work , not enough financial support , breakdown of the family structure , cultural , etc. 
  that is what the damn government is for , spend money to study and analyze the problem and solve it . 
  immigration is n't the be all end all solution . 
  i appreciate your counter arguments but you seem to take away a point i make and run wildly with it . 
  nowhere do i state that we should invade muslim countries and implement silly child policies . 
  what i would like to see is a closing of the floodgates and try to assimilate the ones we currently have . 
  we should also look towards promoting the birthrate of native europeans as currently they are at abysmal rates , rates in fact that fail to maintain a healthy population growth in the long run . 
  i also do n't argue that all immigration is bad , what i see however is europe tends to accept any and all immigration and is not selective about it . 
  the criminality of immigrants coming in is far higher than that of the local populations as well . 
  europe is currently in the midst of a huge financial crisis , and most european countries face large debt to gdp ratios . 
  current immigration policies from outside of europe are a net-loss on the economy and provide no tangible benefit . 
  refugees often do not return home . 
  they end up staying in their host country . 
  it 's the destruction of western civilization and culture i worry most about . 
  islam is the inherent opposite of a free society . 
  europe had/has a huge problem where the local population was not breeding enough to replace themselves and instead of encouraging population growth , the governments of europe decided to instead open up the floodgates of african/middle east immigration . 
  the american dod publish a report a few years ago detailing the issues of islam in europe , which can be found here : http://www.dod.gov/pubs/foi/international_security_affairs/other/09-f-0759thefutureofeuropeand_its_muslims__four_scenarios.pdf the discrimination argument is often cited but failed to be proven . 
  here is another article describing the second generation of muslim immigrants in the us also being more religious . 
  http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2006/12/20061214174958berehellek0.8237268.html here you can also get a world general view that shows islam as the fastest growing religion world wide : http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/, 
  fastest growing religion in europe . 
  http://time.com/3671514/islam-europe/ 2 . 
  atheism/lack of belief/non-religious . 
  when i said non-religious , it was implied it was a lack of religion . 
  http://www.salon.com/2014/03/25/calling_the_christian_right_soon_you_will_be_outnumbered_partner/ if you understand how europe is a lot less religious , than i fail to see how you could not make the connection . 
  europe , as you would probably agree , is quite progressive/liberal/left wing which in turn promotes anti-religious/non-religious ideals . 
  so for europe , with those cultural values , islam is the fastest growing religion by far . 
  why would that be ? 
  well the answer is two-fold , one of which you alluded to . 
  there are areas that are already predominately muslim , which i see as primarily the baltic region . 
  but another part of that is the huge influx of muslims immigrants/refugees . 
  they do n't adopt european values/culture and stick mainly with their own culture ( aka islam . ), 
  it is well known that second/third generation muslims in europe are far more religious than their parents ( see the thousands that drove off to fight jihad in syria . ), 
  so when one says the immigration of muslims to europe is a silent non-violent invasion , that is referring to the invasion of europe through the womb , not through violence ( as has been the attempt over the past 1400 years . ), 
  but if you want a source for the quote , it was often misquoted from gadaffi , but was uttered by houari boumedienne the former president of algeria . 
  if you want the full quote `` one day , millions of men will leave the southern hemisphere to go to the northern hemisphere . 
  and they will not go there as friends . 
  because they will go there to conquer it . 
  and they will conquer it with their sons . 
  the wombs of our women will give us victory . '', 
  muslims . 
  the fastest growing religion in europe is islam . 
  compare that to the us where atheism/non-religious is the fastest growing . 
  it 's call a silent non-violent invasion . 
  or just you know , not accept asylum seekers . 
  they just become refugees and then just end up staying in europe anyways . 
  hahahahahahha ... you seriously wrote something as retarded as that ? 
  no , european governments are not mostly filled with right wing governments , they are filled with mostly center-left in terms of policies and actions . 
  / r/europe is filled with primarily left-wing attitudes/ideals that have constantly failed europe . 
   loan . 
  it 's a fucking loan you lunatics . 
  guess what ? 
  every political party is funded by both inside and outside influences . 
  i also like how all of you leftists say if she was voted in , it would be a disaster ... like it fucking is n't already ? 
  france is in the shiter , huge amounts of continued immigration , increased crime , insane levels of debt , higher taxes ... what the fuck do you think is the solution here ? 
  more government programs ?
