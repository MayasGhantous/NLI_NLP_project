   [ citation ] see !, 
  you care about us !, 
  you hate us do n't you !, 
  omg stop being so mean to belgium :-(, 
  i am not an elected official , my dear friend, 
  there has n't been a strong anti-french rethoric in the western media since iraq at all, 
  except france is n't `` bashing belgium '' . 
  what you are witnessing here is belgians being manipulated by their government to focus on what `` those arrogant frenchies are saying about us '' . 
  no one gives a single fuck about belgium in france . 
  the only articles who mentions belgium are only stating facts i.e `` the attackers gathered in belgium etc. . . '' . 
  how is that * bashing * ? 
  should we just pretend that the terrorists were mexican fundamentalists who gathered in somalia before attacking paris in order to not hurt the sensibility of the belgians ? 
  belgium has an inferiority complex it seriously needs to deal with . 
   such an office . 
  to be fair , it 's a very small office que ^ les ^ belges ^ arretent ^ de ^ chialer ^ svp, 
  what are those `` harsh reactions '' please back up your claims with sources, 
  that thumbnail though, 
  it 's like they think we care about belgium, 
  is this a fucking joke ? 
  we are giving a country that is : - actively sponsoring a group that has committed terrorist attacks on our soil - sharing a border with the most unstable region of the world a `` visa exemption '' ? 
  it 's a kick in the ass they need . 
  have you even read the article you have linked ? 
  it contradicts what you are saying . 
  i am studying in canada but i am from france, 
  sweden a tax heaven ? 
  but germans are n't as good at speaking/writing english, 
  i do n't think that 's what / u/elvishcopter meant . 
  that 's a completely legitimate discussion !, 
  thing is , i expected more quality content from such a strong article . 
  it is disappointing , that is all !, 
  chinese is a race now . 
  * sigh * what a world we are living in ... 
  do americans ever look at maps ? 
  uzebkistan in ukraine ? 
  wtf . 
  sshh do n't tell everyone !, 
  i thought we had a deal !, 
  your comment is not only off-topic but also petty and mean . 
  can someone explain me what does russia has to gain in destabilizing eastern european countries ? 
  why not enjoy the peace , make some trade agreements and chill the fuck out ? 
  what 's the point of all that ? 
  also , and that 's `` off-the-record '' so take it with a grain of salt . 
  the algerian government ( i.e the algerian military ) has secretly asked france to intervene because they ca n't secure their southern border with mali . 
  the algerian generals were afraid that what 's left of the fils/gia get a `` second life '' with battle hardened foreign fighters and `` cutting edge '' libyan weaponry . 
  a failed state in mali could quickly spread to the rest of the region , which no one wants . 
  and according to my `` sources '' the algerians were pissed off that the french military publicly thanked algeria for letting rafale fly over sahara . 
   the guy was arrested for racist remarks exactly . 
  this has nothing to do with `` censorship laws to stop terrorism '' as you previously mentioned . 
  hate speech laws have been around for decades , if not centuries . 
   he once sympathised with the charlie hebdo attackers . 
  that 's not why he was condemned  wow it 's amazing how you can read minds , even through the internet . 
  thanks, 
  i love onfray 's work on albert camus and freud but i wish he stuck to literature and philosophy, 
   this is what happens when people blindly support government censorship to `` stop terrorism '' . 
  did you read the article ? 
  ( i know you did n't , it 's a rethorical question ), 
  the brits at wembley , they behaved and it was quite moving, 
   neither do i , but i just hate it when people tell us to shut up becouse we 're getting eu funds . 
  recently i 've heard enough of arrogant threats from european leaders trying to blackmail us with these money just to enforce this idea of `` quotas '' . 
  i do n't think that 's `` blackmail '' but poland should make compromises whenever it can helps its partners . 
  that 's not completely fair to take without giving if you know what i mean ? 
  especially on something as futile as taking a few thousands refugees . 
   a temporary situation and most of govs have short sighted politics i do n't think that 's a `` temporary '' solution . 
  the investment has proven quite effective ( see growth + gdp per capita and hdi ), 
  i do n't complain about any of those countries , poland included because i think that this is good for the future development of the eu . 
  i think that 's a good use of taxpayers money because that money goes into helping allies to become stronger . 
  i just do n't think that is fair to say that the eu has `` abused '' of poland when data indicates the opposite trend . 
  i am disappointed to see that polish think that when we have been so supportive of poland . 
  and 300 billions euros represents almost 30 % of your gdp by the way . 
  this, 
  that 's exactly what a flag would say ... 
  with beautiful polish flags !, 
  no eu flags !, 
  that 's pretty much the definition of what an aid package is ... a unilateral investment by transfer of resources . 
   like fucking useless multi-milion $ swimming pools in every village ? 
  you know nothing john snow https://skomielnainfo.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ustr4_d.jpg the image you posted comes from this article : [ https://skomielnainfo.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/w-2016-roku-rusza-budowa-basenu/] ( https://skomielnainfo.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/w-2016-roku-rusza-budowa-basenu/ ) and is an april fools joke ... 
  if i am jon snow , you are fucking melissandre - you fraud . 
   it 's just a coincidence that we can only spend it on stuff that eu explicitly agreed upon . 
  like every aid packages that has ever been concluded since the dawn of times . 
  of course the eu is n't going to make a blank check to poland `` have fun guyz '' . 
  the aid was specifically intended to be spent on key infrastructures that poland was lacking . 
  geez . 
  i ca n't believe that 's the hill you choose to die on . 
  the 300 billions are n't trade activity but outright economic aid packages that are meant to boost poland 's growth . 
  i actually want to know what you have to say about this . 
  i did not mean to come off as condescending , poland has a great and long history . . 
   we will , and can manage without the eu can you elaborate ? 
  and quantify what is the amount of eu investments that are poured in the country at the moment ? 
  lol guys , poland has received ~ 142 billions euros over the past 7 years and is scheduled to receive an addition 160 billions over the next decade . 
  if * you * really want to consider yourself a bitch , acknowledge that you are a damn expensive one . 
  you make an amazing scapegoat mein friend . 
  i am just pointing out how stupid this paradigm of thinking is . 
  what poland needs is better infrastructures , growth and development not a bunch of right wing idiots shouting `` poland stronk !, 
  except you ca n't eat national pride . 
  i agree it is hard , and no sane person will tell you that there is n't going to be challenges to be addressed . 
  that being said , i think that 's doable - especially when you take a step back and look at what has already been achieved . 
  it is going to take time , and it 's a long process , but an increasingly ( and gradually ) more centralized power is imho the key to a stronger europe . 
  merci mon capitaine, 
  but we are n't a political union ? 
  why are you mad ?
