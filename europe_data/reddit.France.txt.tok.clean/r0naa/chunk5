  we already have done a hell lot of work !, 
  [ mmmh non-alignment , mmhhh yurop stronk ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xo4r2pu.jpg ), 
  give me a y. 
  give me a u. 
  give me a r. give me a op motherfuckerz . 
  i think i can be considered as `` leftist '' for most political frames of reference in the western world , yet one of the thing that has infuriated me lately is the socialist party 's grotesque attempts at decridibilizing the fn . 
  there is so much stuff they could be attacked on , their economic and social programs completely fall apart under scrutiny . 
  same could be say for parts of their immigration/security programs but since they are the only party talking about it and representing the views of lots of french they get lots of votes this way . 
  a reasoned , imtelligence response to the rise of the fn would be to start talking about these and refute their pseudo-solutions in the open . 
  you know , like pur democratic values would suggest we do . 
  but no , our governement and the media prefer mass hysteria and just flat out denigrate ehat has become one of the largest party of france . 
  they are just `` nazi '' , `` extremists '' and if they win there is a risk of `` civil war '' yada yada . 
  this is absolutely disgusting and beneath the standards the republic has set . 
  i want to see debates , arguments and logic . 
  not fear mongering and intimidation . 
  so yes , the socialist party is currently taking a rocky path and is kind of scaring the shit out of me . 
  i am curious to know what you mean by that , care to elaborate ? 
  maybe there is a nuance i am not getting , but to me it seems that sexism is just misoginism union misandrism . 
  to be clear i ~ ~ men ~ ~ meant equal in rights * the difference between a misoginist and a misandrist is , imho , which gender is your bias rooting for . 
  edit : since no one has picked my terrrible pun ... 
  removing it :(, 
  yeah , by definition if you disagree that men and women are equal you * are * a mysoginist . 
  goddammit , i knew it !, 
  this is a phrase that has a lot of sense in the us where freedom of speech is the * right not to be persecuted by the government * for what you say . 
  it the context of the european tradition of freedom of speech however , it is slightly less relevant . 
  besides that , it is a bit hypocritical to claim that there is true freedom if the social or legal backlash that ensues is disproportionate . 
  by the same token you could argue that you are free to steal or murder , or rape . 
  of course you can do it , but we all agree that none of these actions are legal . 
  if free speech is heavily cracked down upon , there is no free speech . 
  you realize that you are commenting on a thread that reports a study showing precisely that ? 
  all social issue should be discussed , you need to give them some * lebensraum * , 
  what have you done to greece haha, 
  i did not pick any country because yurop is of best country in the world motherfuckerz, 
  thanks !, 
   encouraging discrimination and violence against perceived cultural outsiders in order to `` protect '' the purity of your nation , yeah , that is pretty much a fascist attitude . 
  see , i do n't even agree with the comment you are referring to but : 1 . 
  that 's not even what is advocated 2 . 
  regardless , that is still * not * what fascism means i mean , all i ask for is a bit of intellectual honesty and rigor with the words you choose to use . 
  we live in the information age , just fire up a google search and come back later . 
  or is it too much to ask ? 
  it must be fantastic to be you everything is easy , everything is simple, 
  ok so you insist that it is n't too hard , that 's probably an opinion based on your experience as a border guard . 
  clearly actual border guards are incompetent fucks . 
   make clear to them that they will only get a bare minimum of support to survive ( no pocket money ) , no official recognition , no work permit , and no freedom to move outside their camp if they do n't cooperate . 
  * cough * calais jungle * cough *, 
  i swear that if i see another star wars ad i am going to go full metal alchemist, 
  have you even read that article ? 
  the only reference to immigration is a case of jurisprudence :  birmingham city council v clue ( 2010 ) ewca civ 460\u00a029/4 / 2010 -- a challenge to the decision to refuse to provide ms clue and her family with essential support pending the uk border agency 's determination of her application for indefinite leave to remain in the uk . 
  in a ground breaking decision of the court of appeal , the judgment extends the scope of community care provision for families subject to immigration control who seek to remain in the uk on article 8 echr grounds that has * nothing * to do with your first claim ... 
  that 's already standard procedure . 
  what do you do with folks who wo n't say a word ( or only speak in broken english ) and do n't have identification papers ? 
   yes , they do n't have any passport but it should still be possible to find out where they are from how ? 
  do n't bother , just keep in mind that this sub is not europe and that we did not do that to get thank you notes . 
  we did that out of love for a european ideal , and while numerous challenges need to be addressed , fantastic work has been accomplished since the eu inception . 
  people are impatient by nature , but this is fine . 
  and our children will enjoy being citizens of the most powerful nation the earth has ever seen . 
   without the uk the eu will be totally dominated by germany . 
  many countries wo n't like this certainly the countries orientated for the anglo-saxon alliance ( think of the netherlands and some of the scandinavian countries ) . 
  i think you should start following european union news instead of blindly eating whatever the daily mail is feeding you with . 
  for one thing , the european central bank 's decision to start quantitative easing policy is a * direct * effect of the influence of france in the council of ministers . 
  and that 's something that has and will continue to drive more growth within the eu . 
  and the list goes on , but no way i am going to take more time to reply to a comment like yours that just make grandiose claims without backing them whatsoever . 
  do some research , read about the eu institutions and which countries have spearheaded standardization and monetary union efforts and then come back . 
  you never get tired of spreading your fud on this subreddit , too much time on your hands maybe ? 
  a perk of forced unemployment i guess . 
  a border is generally * shared * , like an edge connecting two vertices . 
  regardless of what was the comment you were referring to , do you know the definition of fascism ? 
  because it does not mean `` anyone that disagrees with me '' . 
   moreover , how would france admit that these people want to leave the best country ever 10/10 calais mystery solved , move along folks, 
  that 's exactly what is being done , but guess what ... it takes less time to write that on reddit than to implement this in real life . 
  especially when the number of people keeps growing because our ( the eu ) southern border is not guarded with a eu corps border guards ( though this is going to change soon ) . 
  could you please link a source ? 
  this frankly sounds dubious to me and i could not find anything relevant when searching for `` right to a family '' . 
  you sound like someone who tries too hard to sound smart by drawing bizarre and grandiloquent parallels between seemingly unrelated situations . 
  please stop, 
  if they are n't in the uk at this very moment , it is because of the french police . 
  this bottleneck in mass migration to britain did not create itself . 
  the main problematic is that those people do n't have passports or government ids that could be use to deport them . 
  what should be done ? 
  send them in a random country ? 
  do you think that these countries will accept receiving unidentified people ? 
  it is really a lot more complicated than you make it sound like . 
   in 10 years how could you possibly get this wrong when i said ** twice ** that my timeframe was over the next three decades :  ** the past three decades ** ( and notably since 1957 ) and how it is likely to change ** over the next three others . 
  ** and you might call this a fantasy all you want , if you think that france and the uk can keep their influence and economical power intact when their combined population is barely the one of india 's least populous region then you are going to be disappointed . 
  while india , china and brazil are currently busy dealing with domestic growth they * will * , as countries always do , start to focus on projecting their interests and diplomatic power abroad . 
  and we should know , perhaps better than anyone else , that countries are ready to do anything to dominate . 
  they will inevitably start to compete with us on `` highly-skilled '' markets that are currently under western monopoly . 
  and when this happens , you will probably want to have the means both political and economical to face this new challenge . 
  this works from an economical and political standpoint as well . 
  if anything , we need to be ready for the day our sphere influence starts to friction with their growing one . 
   the eu has a place as a trade bloc to protect our position in the global marketplace , but there 's simply no need to become a federal super-state . 
  politics is becoming more localized , not less . 
  there is no merit to ceding further powers to bureaucrats thousands of miles away . 
  that 's an interesting choice of words `` bureaucrats '' . 
  i have already addressed that point in my previous comment ( that you manifestly did n't read past the first sentence ) . 
  so i am sure you will understand if i do n't bother repeating myself . 
   localised politics is proving to be more effective than just having one very powerful central government . 
  really ? 
  you understand that this is the polar opposite of being to speak with one voice and that is synonym of being at the mercy of foreign powers that will just circumvent the group 's decision by playing on the interests of each individual country . 
   there is no merit to ceding further powers to bureaucrats thousands of miles away no , no merit * at all * .
