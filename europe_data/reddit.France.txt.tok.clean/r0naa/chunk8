  force is the only language they understand . 
  because we want europe to be powerful and hegemonic i.e not a bunch of microstates that are doomed to be poor and irrelevant . 
  the reason so many people are federalist is because they have a longer-term vision , and see that over the next fifty years individual european nations that are currently powerful and influential ( i.e triumvirate france , germany and uk ) will weight for nothing against india , china , brazil and the us . 
  our only hope ( imho ) is to unite forces and merge ( long processus that has already started ) . 
  a united , focused europe is going to be a force to be reckoned and we will be able to fight for the interest of the european people . 
  sharp and cold , yet incredibly attractive . 
  french people switching to french when engaging a one-one discussion ? 
  how dare they !? 
  it happens * all the time * on / r/europe , and not just with french but also polish , spanish and ukrainian . 
  it 's a multi-lingual subreddit esp\u00e8ce d'imb\u00e9cile . 
  get over yourself and keep your junk food for thought to yourself . 
  you should look up the concept of alterity in anthropology . 
  meanwhile , applying your american-centered view of the world to countries you know nothing about will still be considered retarded and ignorant by the locals . 
  it used to be , but i strongly suspect that the vote is starting to be ideologically motivated as well . 
  the medias , mainstream parties and their followers are antagonising a huge chunk of the population . 
  this has went on for two decades , but the fn has grew steadily during that period and if everything stays the same , they will continue until the `` mainstream party '' reach the point they are ostracising no one but themselves . 
  tricky . 
  why are you saying that he wants to do a coup in france why are you harassing / u/976692e3005e1a7cfc41, 
  if jupp\u00e9 does not win the primary ... fuck, 
  that 's a lot better !, 
  thanks :-), 
  you see , i hate the fn folks but what grind my gears even more is the ridiculous amount of bullcrap people like you need to resort to in order to attack them . 
  just use your fucking brain , use rational well-balanced arguments to refute their bullshit . 
  yeah it 's harder than posting a one-line snarky comment , but it would also make people understand * why * they are so bad . 
  trying to make them look bad by saying that they are `` buddy '' with a random asshole or constantly using hyperbolas to call them a `` fascist '' / `` extreme '' party when they really just are `` conservatives '' ( including in canada ) is making your cause a great disservice . 
  and it also fosters a stupid culture that hinder people from questioning what is the mass media narrative and make an opinion for themselves . 
  tl ; dr : be critical , thoughtful and measured . 
  and provide solid arguments to prove your claims or refute theirs . 
  that 's ridiculous , comparing the fn with tea party . 
  they really are n't * that * bad , the american far right is much more `` extreme '' than the fn . 
  you do n't really know what you are talking about do you ? 
  thank you for your analysis , i think it is spot on . 
  the death of patriotism in europe has created an ideological vacuum that is being filled by religion when it really should have been replaced by a common european identity . 
  islamism and nationalism are worst enemies and one is a vaccine to the other . 
  politics should be more about planning than reaction though, 
  i am at a loss for words ... 
  yeah let 's please aspire to obtain something better than a death for dollar industry . 
  and in a pantzer annexing anschluss,

  you understand he is being sarcastic right ? 
  definitely a troll . 
  but a talented one . 
  and funny . 
  [ i told you that nationalism was not comestible !, 
  nobody listened ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3u3u9v/new_polish_pm_removes_eu_flag_from_government/cxbnz5h ), 
  switzerland is another spelling of sweden but you can also call it by its new name : great sultanate of al-sverige by the grace of allah ( sws ),

  i know you were being sarcastic , take an upvote, 
  people said the same thing in algeria in the 80s guess what ? 
  a civil war funded by foreign powers of the middle east ( guess which ones ) , coordinated by three western embassies ( hello usa ) , fought by religious lunatics who slowly took over every institution that hold influence over the algerian society . 
  it was more than twenty years ago and the country still has not recovered and is worse than the pre-war era . 
  i think you are smart enough to realize that you are making a slippery slope argument . 
  i do n't think anyone has ever been coerced into atheism because of la\u00efcit\u00e9 though ... ? 
  have you experienced that ? 
  you know what else is a road to tyranny ? 
  - religious totalitarianism, 
   that definitely bears studying too i wonder how long it will take them to realize that foreign powers financing extreme ideologies on france 's territory is an open act of hostility . 
   and you ( we ) ca n't let daesh recruit openly in your ( our ) poor neighborhoods either . 
  because that 's what they do , and why we are closing down some places . 
  exactly . 
  people seem to forget that having salafist/wahhabi / ( insert extreme revivalist islam movement here ) preachers in a mosque legitimize that speech ( make it mainstream ) and marginalize the people who think otherwise ( `` u r no tru muslimi . 
  remove u '' ), 
   i think it 's safe to say that just removing religion from the public sphere has not stopped the creation of parallel societies , i think you are making a big mistake in thinking that religion was * actually * removed from the public sphere in some areas . 
  catholicism was , but islam was n't . 
  that is until very lately ( 2000s ) that 's fine . 
  france needed time to adapt and now more people are starting to understand what are the weaknesses of our society with respect to the `` new '' religious danger . 
  the french society was able to remove and limit the influence of the church when it was a central part of its society for more than 1500 years . 
  i am confident we will face this new challenge and succeed . 
  only different religions have different ways to secure their grip on civil societies . 
  similarly we are living in different times that call for different methods . 
  nevertheless , i think that more than ever la\u00efcit\u00e9 is the way to go . 
  and i tell you that as a recent immigrant from algeria who comes from a muslim background . 
  la\u00efcit\u00e9 has enabled my sister to not get comments from muslims boys because she was not wearing a veil . 
  similarly , nobody has ever asked me why i was n't praying because the school just wo n't accommodate special desires : if you want to pray , do it at home . 
  they may sound trivial issues , but they significantly made my life better . 
  peer pressure is a real thing , and it is infuriating ( and frustrating ) to get coerced into practicing a religion . 
  i genuinely think that la\u00efcit\u00e9 is the most important and strongest protection of freedom of consciousness . 
  i have experienced it first hand , and i am sure many have as well . 
   brown people because they are `` brown '' ? 
  this adjective is so fucking stupid, 
   brown people i do n't understand the emphasis on skin color here ? 
  would it make a difference if they were blue , white or red ? 
  what exactly does it bring to the discussion ? 
  besides that , you should be aware that advocating for the status quo is n't really the opposite of `` not killing innocents '' . 
  if anything the heavy bombings in iraq ( on moving troops ) have stopped isis spread when they were at the ** gates ** of baghdad . 
  all i ask for is consistency . 
   which is totally insane infact , they shouldnt even have used all the 12 days after which they needed parliament . 
  they should have passed a law some limited ( like , absolute number ) extra ability to do house searches so they can find these people . 
  that 's exactly what they did when the national assembly ( you know the guys who have a mandate from the people of france , the people whose opinion actually matters here ) voted the * etat d'urgence * as asked by the president of the republic ( you know the guy ** directly ** elected by the people of france ) . 
  unless you have some intel the french government does n't have , i hope you wo n't mind if i trust my country 's leadership to decide what are the appropriate measures to take to respond to the attack . 
  that 's kinda why we put them in office . 
   they have banned climate protests at cop21 , there is absolutely no indication that the activists are targets or that they themselves pose any threat . 
  hahaha .
