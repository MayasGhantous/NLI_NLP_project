  peaceful protesters ? 
  are you referring to the far left extremists who threw acid bottles on the police and desecrated a monument ? 
  because i am totally fine with the police cracking down on rioters . 
  or are you referring to the * actually * peaceful protesters who had no problem whatsoever ? 
  there was three protests in paris , two of them were peaceful and had no issues with the police * at all * ( 0 arrests ) . 
  one of them was - as expected when world leaders gather ( see g8 , g20 , cop20 , nato summit etc. . . ) - extremely violent and composed of professional provocateurs . 
   ( less certain ) it seems like they 're going after `` conspiracy theorists '' . 
  at least wearechange.org is down . 
  reading the definition of hollandes party of `` conspiracy theorist '' , it is dangerously widely defined . 
  ... please tell me you are n't referring to the `` conspiracy theory law '' hoax . 
  please . 
   again and again , when terrorism happens , civil liberties and privacy are attacked . 
  snowden didnt reveal that they spied on terrorists . 
  he revealed that they spy on everyone . 
  this shit is n't for us you know the nsa is an american intelligence agency right ? 
  in other words : france ! = usa, 
   please tell me , is it legal in france today for people to gather and protest against the government if they feel the government is doing something wrong ? 
  ok , you are either playing dumb or do n't understand what is the point of a state of emergency . 
  whatever ... 
   but what 's to say they 'll stop it after the 3 months pass ? 
  certainly not you . 
  to be prolonged , the government would need 2/3 of the parliaments ' vote and the approval of the consitutional council . 
   isis can not be defeated , it 's an ideology and not a nation isis holds territories , have a judicial system , a law enforcement militia , an education system , a functioning army and they collect taxes . 
  they are by any measure a functioning state . 
  the ideologies you are referring to are * qtbism * , * salafism * and * wahhabism * . 
   that can surrender which is why the objective is their destruction pure and simple . 
  there wo n't be any political deal with them . 
  they will be wiped off the map . 
   , so you can never realistically say france is safe from terrorist attacks . 
  france never will be . 
  and no country is . 
  but that 's not the point here . 
  the state of emergency is being used to dismantle terrorist cells that have been established on france 's sovereign land . 
  they were allowed to grow because this is a problem that was not taken seriously early enough . 
  while the risk will ** never ** be zero , you want to maintain it below a certain threshold that you deem reasonable . 
  maintaining the status quo will do nothing but worsen the situation beyond repair . 
   so yes , the danger is there , but is surrendering your rights worth it ? 
  i am personally not surrendering anything . 
  the state of emergency is not the patriot act , i understand that people like to draw parallels with what they are familiar with . 
  but it would really take a few minutes to educate yourself about the french constitution and the current legal measures being taken to see that they are truly different things . 
  that 's a pretty mean hearted comment . . 
  and i find it amazing how quick to judge are people who do not have skin ( i.e family and closed ones ) in the game . 
  has it ever crossed your mind that there could be some legitimate domestic issues the french government has to deal with ? 
  i wish there was another way , but i think you really need to factor that : - the french government has followed a strict legislation to declare the state of emergency - the medias have not been put under government control , on the contrary a law has been voted to reinforce their independence and maintain a certain balance of powers . 
  - the legal framework surrounding a `` state of emergency '' is well-defined , clear and known by everyone . 
  this is n't something new that is being pulled off but a constitutional clause that was designed precisely for this kind of situation . 
  - there are legitimate problems that need to get solved and that exceptional times call exceptional measures . 
  when your capital city get attacked and 130 innocent young people get slaughtered by religious lunatics , you have a moral duty to break the status quo and * act * . 
  it would need 2/3 approval from the parliament + constitutional council . 
  akin to political suicide and very unlikely imho . 
  well to be fair i never heard of it in the french medias , and the only people who ever did seem to be german . 
  that raises some interesting questions ... what the fuck is going on ? 
  fucking read the thread we talked about dual citizens, 
  and as a dual national myself ( france - algeria ) that is something i would completely support . 
  if you actively work against the interest of the country and take part in international terrorism , you do not deserve to be part of the national community . 
  i do n't think anyone use these i hope, 
  yes so what ? 
  the sultanate of al-sverige is proud of its traditions, 
  petite crapule de merde i hope for some rafale to pay you a visit, 
  thanks for raising that point , i 'll edit my comment edit : wait , do you mind adding links because i do n't really understand 2 ) edit2 : i think by `` pro-ecology '' the fn means they want to keep nuclear energy , not sure though and i ca n't make a research on that right now, 
  abruti, 
  we are on / r/europe france is a fascist country , police forces are n't on high alert and busy with fighting home grown terrorist cells and * of course * `` climate activist '' = peaceful , freedom loving swede who wants to save baby seals from the xenophobic frog eater . 
  net neutrality , independent and `` strong '' ( whatever that means ) judicial branch , force referendums for constitutional changes , proportional elections , pro-green agenda etc. . . edit : / u/zerojanvier 's comment below suggest that the `` pro-green '' stuff is pretty weak, 
  they are, 
  yeah there are n't an anti-french rethoric in the anglo medias since 2003 at all . 
   while racism is a real problem both in france and belgium , honestly as a `` non-white '' french as well , i have n't faced any blatant racism . 
  i am not saying it does not exist at all , but it is a very negligible inconvenience to my everyday life . 
  like rain . 
  the stuff i read sometimes on reddit about france being a xenophobic , fascist country blow my mind . 
  i think there is an issue with my own minority and you highlighted that very well . 
  there are some stuff you just ca n't compromise on . 
   yet to be confirmed when president hollande was giving his speech . 
  it was confirmed * by * the president 's speech  a lot of media outlets did/do exactly that . 
  again , can you cite any ? 
  i ca n't find articles from the french medias `` bashing '' belgium . 
  it 's barely mentioned every time . 
   has been successful in taking large numbers of votes from the leftist parties . 
  that 's also because today 's fn is largely on the left on social issues and on the right on immigration and sovereignty . 
  i think ultra-conservatives is the most fitting term to describe the fn . 
  far more than `` far right '' since they are in favour of stuff that would make actual far right parties lose their shit . 
  we are so lucky to have you here / s, 
  this is fantastic haha bien jou\u00e9 le gland de toilette , prend mon hautvote, 
  i think you found a loophole in the french constitution . 
  should be worried about a coup by the eurovision presenter ? 
  i am calling the army , we need to protect the elys\u00e9e palace , it might be too late !, 
  note : that 's a joke obviously , do n't put me on a list hav a gud day mr surveillance xoxo, 
  no , please ... 
  i will be in mannheim this summer , may i ask how do you like the city ? 
  would you recommend it ? 
  said the dane !, 
   as long as i can remember lol, 
  yes , and your prime minister is making a fool out of himself by leveling himself to that level . 
  besides that , no one gives a single fuck about belgium . 
  french people are completely indifferent . 
  the president is , his mandate and legitimacy comes directly from the people of france . 
  he is the only one that can claim to speak in our name . 
   in his first speech , after the paris attacks , french president hollande said that the attacks were prepared for and organised in belgium that 's a fact  putting the blame on belgian intelligence and justice system . 
  that 's extrapolating  kind of like how this comment by charles miche ** pathetic ** coming from a head of state . 
   both countries are working very close together to deal with this situation , have been in the past and will be in the future . 
  of course they are .
