  although its quite redundant . 
  often this fluency is not total . 
  they get the basics completely and can understand tv but most of them would not be able to follow a real life every day conversation in a family for example . 
  i mean even though they are fluent they do n't get all the aspects of `` anglo '' culture , humour etc. . . where a native english speaker will always trump them . 
  thats the impression i get living in sweden at least . 
  the problem is that with a language comes a culture . 
  as long as it is a second language to everyone then its ok . 
  else it will diminish the existing diversity . 
  plus theres the issue of the big advantage the uk gets . 
  well they already have it ... 
  why is n't this a major scandal ? 
  and the most destructive ever in some countries like france . 
  the tanks used there are of a different kind . 
  lighter and on wheels . 
  main battle tanks have little use these days so i understand the decision . 
  ordered one ( 2 weeks ago ) and waiting for it to arrive  . 
  they have had some trouble delivering because they only did small production runs . 
  very well , see libya and read up on the aasm guided bomb . 
  yeah ovh 's ceo ( oles ) is on twitter a lot and is not happy . 
  they are planning to build a datacenter in germany . 
  but hubic is based on tge french dcs as far as i know . 
  it seems like she is speaking with a strong spanish accent , which makes sense considering the history . 
  i wonder how basque sounded before spanish influence . 
  in the recent military cuts in france the size of the regular army has been diminished but the size of the special forces augmented . 
  so some people seem to think that kind of strategy works . 
  see http://www.humanite.fr/social-eco/defense-les-etats-majors-en-premiere-ligne-face-au-546605 mali and libya kind of prove that point . 
  a first area where military could be pooled in the eu is procurment ( designing fighters , ship , etc. . ) and logistics ( transport aircraft ) . 
  just a detail but the number of troops will be [ 1600 ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/12/07/les-premiers-renforts-terrestres-francais-penetrent-en-centrafrique_3527420_3212.html ) actually . 
  it is mostly people working in the financial industry in london . 
  also london is a world city and is very close to paris . 
  french people living in london can `` commute '' quite easily to france , especially paris . 
  also even though france does n't shine by its english level more french people know english than english people know french . 
  so its not that surprising . 
  and french engineering ? 
  the ratings should reflect the chance of default do n't they ? 
  do you think that france will default on its debt anytime soon ? 
  unless i am missing some subtleties in the meaning of the ratings . 
  i think the credit ratings have quite a big delay between the facts and adjusting the ratings . 
  i would say the french economy has been improving in the last months . 
  the deficit is maybe not decreasing as fast as they want but it is steadily decreasing . 
  so s&p ratings seem to be a bit like last years news . 
  this does n't seem to count snuss . 
  which would bias th\u00e9 result for sweden a lot . 
  why do you want a kfc , it tastes like cardboard ... 
  one aspect is that they favour british/american style big universities and place a lot of importance on the number of research papers produced instead of the actual education . 
  at least that explains while french universities are nowhere to be seen . 
  french secondary education is focused on small specialised schools and most research is done in public institutions . 
  because of these lists the government started grouping these schools into fake universities or campuses . 
  basically just giving an international name to a grouping of 10 schools for example . 
  edit : for example since sorbonne is somehow very famous outside of france ( but its not considered a top10 school in france ) they name engineered a university called [ sorbonne university ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbonne_university_%28alliance%29 ) grouping several institutions . 
  they would n't have permanent access to their servers for one . 
  and less capability to get access in various european countires . 
  since the union is n't united at all when it comes to spying . 
  i have a galaxy s3 for work and an n9 and i still use my n9 for these reasons . 
  multi tasking is just that much more intuitive . 
  and i love the clock ui as well . 
  from my experience ( french person living in sweden ) , french people tend to stay more hours at work per week even though the contract says 37 or 40 hours . 
  especially compared to sweden where people always stick to their 40 hours , not that i 'm comlpaning about that . 
  from a french person 's perspective : music : * http://www.spotify.com * http://www.deezer.com/en/ * http://www.qobuz.com/ ( hifi , does n't seem to be available in english yet ) video sharing : * http://www.dailymotion.com professional social network ( linked-in alternative ) : * http://www.viadeo.com/en/ search : * http://www.qwant.com/ ( not sure if its good ) maps : * http://here.com ( belongs to nokia , not sure if this is under american legislation ) dropbox alternative : * http://www.wuala.com/ * https://www.hubic.com/ ( does n't seem to be available in english yet ) cloud : * http://www.ovh.co.uk/cloud/instances/, 
  how is mcdo worse in france ?? 
  i can assure you that some sensitive technology like french nuclear missiles is not shared even though they share a common ceo . 
  some parts of airbus are french only and some german only , sharing only the revenue . 
  which explains the spying . 
  there are european alternatives to each of these that a military could use . 
  also in this context american open source is better than american closed source . 
  agreed , however the two biggest parts are french and german . 
  ugh google translate is horrible for french to english . 
  any time you use a word with multiple meanings it will barf . 
  dailymotion is quite popular in france . 
  and i guess french people watch more stuff in french . 
  or northern italy . 
  paris definitely was 20 years ago . 
  i guess they are good enough for military purposes which is the whole point . 
  they are still buying 36 rafales directly from france so dont get your hopes up . 
  though telecharger has always been more common than download in common usage . 
  pubs are much more expensive in paris than london . 
  in france napoleon is still seen in quite a positive way because of the civil code , university system etc. . . 
  i did paris-gothenburg in 3 trains , takes about 20 hours with the slowest part being going through denmark . 
  paris -  k\u00f6ln -  ( night train ) copenhaguen -  g\u00f6teborg, 
  well except for the fact that dacias are mostly designed by renault . 
  it is in fact worse . 
  just an anecdote but i am working in such a company in sweden . 
  there at least its not completely unheard of . 
  well that explains a lot . 
  the same thing costs 150 $ a month in sweden . 
  in france an internship longer than 3 months has to be paid ( with at least the minimum wage if im not mistaken ) . 
  i was working for a european industry company and they definitely warned us about being careful with our laptops when travelling to the us . 
  same as for china . 
  even if there is no hard ( or showable ) evidence its more of a everybody knows it happens kind of thing . 
  thats quite recent though and i dont think it applies to all . 
  well except that the sactions are political not humanitarian iran = nono , ksa = yesyes, 
  generation doesnt mean that much appart from the obvious stealth . 
  the rafales are constantly upgraded with new electronics and weaponry and does stuff like sensor fusion and electronic warfare quite well . 
  how much of it ? 
  the neighbourghood this happened is known to be a problem area with lots of poor immigrants . 
  unless its about france . 
  they are very biased . 
  especially the economist . 
  and nissans, 
  nobody i know boils lardons , we fry them on the pan .
