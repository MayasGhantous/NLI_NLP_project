this is ridiculous . 
  the guy sounds like a twat but a 3 months sentence will only give him street cred when he eventually gets out while preventing him from getting a job anytime soon . 
  it will ruin his life without serving any purpose . 
  if you must sentencing him , make him do lame community service , not hard time in jail . 
  our great grand parents were wiry short guys tough as nails that ate a lot less meat than we do , they were nothing like `` beta nice guys '' . 
  you can have a healthy diet and be a [ manly man ] ( https://www.fugly.com/pictures/51742/kangaroo_jacked.html ) without eating meat 3 times a day . 
  no , it 's not like that in french . 
  she used a totally inappropriate word , she was being a smartass , making a reference to [ an anti-slavery text by montesquieu ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_l%27esprit_des_lois#chapitre_remarquable_:_de_l.27esclavage_des_n.c3.a8gres ) that most people would n't get anyway . 
  the thing is , anyone in a government leadership position should be media savvy enough to know better . 
  it 's not a pension , it 's welfare for old people with no other income . 
  it just got a little more restrictive now , before that you could claim it then fuck off anywhere you wanted and keep getting the money every month as long as you did n't have income in france . 
  but i agree france is a great place for pensioners , they get a lot of free shit here . 
  once you 've dealt with the bureaucratic bullshit and paperwork , you 're all set . 
  for the young or the independently wealthy , it 's not so great . 
  meanwhile the french will give you [ 800 euros as long as you are a resident and over 65 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/allocation_de_solidarit%c3%a9_aux_personnes_%c3%a2g%c3%a9es ) , even if you never worked there . 
  we 'll see which pension system goes bankrupt first . 
  ouch . 
  i 'd say new media . 
  10-15 years ago people would get their news from the papers or tv which were clearly affiliated with mainstream political parties and the internet was for nerds , now it 's everywhere . 
  for better or worse , better imo , alternative point of views are a lot more easier to find and disseminate nowadays . 
  even a masterful troll like the fabulous milo yiannopoulos would n't have any exposure if it was n't for the internet and social media . 
  some place with low living cost but high welfare . 
  some areas of france would qualify if you gave up on the idea of ever working legally again . 
  i guess being old helps , french welfare is throwing free shit at old people left and right . 
  free , as in paid with someone else 's money . 
  you can get cheaper train tickets if you know how to take advantage of the various rebates and travel card schemes , i have n't figured out how it works really ( there are 39 euros tickets from paris to munich ) . 
  but once you factor in the cost and time to get to and from the airport to your destination it can be pretty competitive . 
  i 've traveled from paris to lille , marseilles , brussels , london , berlin and munich by train , i would do it again . 
  if you feel adventurous , you can even [ travel by night and get a proper bed ] ( https://en.rail.cc/paris-stuttgart-munich/citynightline-40451-cassiopeia/night-trains-city/10397/32 ) for the price of staying at a decent hotel . 
  high speed railways are the shit , extending the network through the alps between italy and france would be huge . 
  [ louis ck learns about the catholic church ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabsohyqr6k ), 
  travelling by train is a great way to move around europe , it beats flying imo . 
  trains are much more convenient and comfortable , they drop you right in the middle of town , you can show up at the station and get a ticket minutes before the next one , and it gives you a sense of geography you just do n't get on a plane . 
  edit : i 've never used them but you can get unlimited [ european rail passes for pretty cheap ] ( http://www.interrail.eu/interrail-passes/global-pass?gclid=cmr9rofp4cscfrdhgwodd0wopq ) , it 's a great way to travel on a budget too . 
  keep the nukes . 
  look at the list of countries that were invaded in the past few decades , when push comes to shove nobody fucks around with a nation that has nukes . 
  even a formal alliance with a country that has them is n't as good as having them yourself . 
  or maybe victims of crappy parenting if both your kids were brought up to think joining a group isis sounded like a good idea . 
  maybe , just maybe handing out money to anyone that breeds is n't such a good idea after all . 
  there 's possibly too many of us as it is , we do n't need more dysfunctional dummies that ca n't tell right from wrong . 
  is that his actual hair ? 
  but how ? 
  and separate bedrooms ... 
  i saw one in france , that 's how ( some ) people used to keep butter from going bad without a fridge . 
  it works and keeping butter at room temperature makes it easier to spread . 
  wait . 
  what ? 
  no [ jean-claude van damme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce8xken0zk4#t=38s ) , the muscles from brussels ? 
  hogwash !, 
  of course there will be a huge push for cashless transaction . 
  they want a cut of everything you earn , spend or save and more than that they 'd love to have control to take it all away the day shtf . 
  fuck them . 
  cigarettes . . worse than krokodil . 
  edit : we get it , smoking is bad for your health . 
  anyone that thinks otherwise is a retard that ca n't be taken out of the gene pool fast enough . 
  but claiming it will make your dick fall off is dishonest . 
  i 've had relatives that smoked moderately and died ... of something else . 
  in fact , i do n't know of anyone that died of lung or throat cancer . 
  this is some refeer-madness level shit , thinking it 's ok to lie to people for their own good is never cool . 
  no worries , the killjoy brigade is already banning or taxing the living shit out of everything fun . 
  i can now not afford a smoke and a couple of pints as often as i would like to so that some egotistical cunt can live his/her fascistic savior complex . 
  good job , now go fuck yourself . 
  and everybody is standing out in the rain so that a couple of twats can enjoy their smoke free bar , fuck you very much .

   the international business done by chinese companies is already done in english but sometimes it comes across [ kind of funny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbpwitste2k ) . 
  and idiots like these are the reason why we ca n't have nice things . 
  not to worry , if they keep taxing the shit out of tobacco it will be more expensive than weed soon enough . 
  nicotine addiction is nothing compared to addiction to spending other people 's money . 
  on the upside , these cunts will make cigarette smuggling a low risk but very profitable trade . 
  somebody made [ a great post looking both at the pros and cons of basic income ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/2twaoe/is_a_basic_income_badeconomics_no_not_really_but/ ) . 
  there 's also the / r/basicincome sub but posts over there are preaching to the choir . 
  i 'm not sure it 's even on the radar of mainstream politicians , i do n't think they have the balls to touch it with a pole . 
  personally , i doubt it would work , even as a negative income tax . 
  even if you could finance it , which seems dificult , it would have too many drawbacks and unintended consequences . 
  but i like seeing people talk about alternatives , acknowledging some things need to change .

  as far as i can tell , british jihadis are more often professional and middle class . 
  in contrast , french jihadis tend to be lower class youth from sketchy social housing projects , they 're petty thugs with no marketable skills .

  it would have been easy to settle there back then . 
  now his best chance is to file his applications with the large consulting groups but he probably wo n't get the same kind of offer he would have had otherwise . 
  i do agree with op though , it 's not the 70s anymore and we should be more selective with our immigration policy . 
  in fact , we should probably make it easier for skilled workers to come over for a while . 
  you feel very strongly about this , it 's fine . 
  i 'm of the opinion we should n't get involved in a new cold war when we do n't have to which you obviously do n't agree with . 
  if you have the time , check out the [ dan carlin podcast ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdt_cs5rjl4 ) where he articulates this opinion much better than i can . 
  edit : also , when arguing why we should get involved , do n't use the nazi germany comparison . 
  it 's been overused during the buildup to the iraq war and does n't help you the way you think it does . 
  and even if there were , the area around the cathedral is a pretty big open space . 
  you could n't track what everybody in a crowd is doing there with cctv . 
  i hope it does n't get to that or we 'll be there in 20 years . 
  the middle east is a messed up place , arabs hate each other more than anyone else and there 's nothing we can do about it .
