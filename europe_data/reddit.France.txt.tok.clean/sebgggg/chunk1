you meant tulip right ? 
  the same could be said about italian fascist no ? 
  thank you !, 
   anyone can leave , but only after being threatened with war , what the hell are you talking about ? 
   poverty , and destruction , and even then during leave negotiations everything will be heavily against their favor just because . 
  well if you leave , you do n't want the eu to look out for your interests . 
  d'uh . 
   the eu is a large mafia , nothing more . 
  right . 
  refering to ... ? 
  paywall, 
  i know we 're flawed , but surely , we do n't deserve the lepens !, 
  why , thank you . 
  the lepens certainly deserve it . 
  her father , the party 's founder , is a notorious neo nazi . 
  she has tried to change the fn 's image , and it seems to work unfortunatly . 
  you mean the turd does n't fall far from the asshole . 
  strictly speaking yes . 
  but his defense attempts have been from bad to worse , it 's been one lie after the other . 
  besides it does n't matter , even if he 's in the clear legally , his moral image is completely destroyed . 
  sure . 
  enjoy obamacare while you can . 
  stoling public money while saying the poors are parasites . 
  right indeed . 
  listen as in blindly trust , no one obviously , everyone have his agenda or bias wether its media , countries or people , but some are more honest and accurate than others and those i listed rank pretty fucking low . 
  and make your own informed judgement i guess , by which i mean , having at least an idea of people/media/countries interests and motives . 
  you know , things may not be perfect in france and eu , but you should stop listening to fox , putintv , dolan and our own idiots , because things are n't as bad as they say ( shocker ) . 
  in a way , it 's a shame dolan could n't pass his aca because you 'd have seen him for what he is . 
  `` does n't want '' ? 
  the eu did not force anyone to join and anyone can leave . 
  as for fairness , solidarity is one of eu principles , with the understanding that helping members develop their economies benefits everyone . 
  finally , despite orban , it seems hungarians favors the eu . 
  but it 's an irrationnal number , it never ends !, 
  and we hope dolan will get impeached . 
  `` he who falls asleep with a scratching butt will wake up with a stinky finger '' - france is bacon . 
  op , i am so , so sorry . 
  it has everything to do with it . 
  the post just shows orban is full of shit in a funny way . 
  read the survey orban wrote , it 's ridiculous . 
  that 's a new unit , a fillion euros . 
  point taken , and i 'm not a fan of the economic rules of the eu myself . 
  but i 'm not sure it would be better if poland was outside of eu , it would still have to be part of the capitalist system but without the protection of the eu against big powers like the us or china for example . 
  because that 's exactly what is happening here . 
  right . 
   i would love to talk with you , and convice you , if possible , but sadly my english limits me to fully experes myself . 
  your english is understandable . 
   in short . 
  money wise , yes we get more then we pay , long term wise we really dont . 
  why ? 
  it seems to me poland is receiving money to develop its economy , which in turn , allow other eu countries to sell more and everyone benefits . 
  meaning what ? 
  uk is still in the eu you know ? 
  `` yes , but no taxes are good , my friend !, 
  the lower the better !, 
  yay no government ! '', 
  every low/no information * woke redpilled * right wing redneck in america . 
  that 's how you come across fyi . 
   if trump and brexit should have thought you anything is that you better ~ ~ brace yourself ~ ~ * clench your anus and pinch your nose * rather than cross your fingers . 
   call people who disagree with you `` disgusting '' if you like but you may want to take a look at recent political upheaval in the uk , we have yet to see how it will turn out . 
   the usa it 's going so well . 
   and soon france to see how well that typically turns out you wish . 
   no , because according to this sub , everything related to the eu is perfect . 
  no one ever said that , please link the unicorn comment . 
  poland benefits even more from eu funds . 
  yes that 's exactly like the ussr . 
  in fact , we already have tanks in uk to slaughter these decadent traitors . 
  not to mention the political police is on its way to send you to a gulag , while brussels is planning a famine . 
  the same i tell you !, 
  because : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/hu/index_en.cfm http://bbj.hu/economy/24-billion-net-eu-funding-for-hungary-in-2007-2013_78519 http://www.politics.hu/20140415/hungary-receives-24-billion-euros-in-eu-funds-between-2007-2013/ so hungary received ~ 24b euros net for 2007-2013 and will do again for 2014-2020 . 
  `` fazakas noted the importance of european subsidies , adding that in the given period such subsidies had covered 99.8 percent of the cost of public development projects in hungary . '', 
  i , too , died a little ... 
  or is there some law that says you can not criticise orban ? 
  show me where it 's written ... 
   24b euros net net meaning after substracting what hungary pays from what it receives , it 's left with an excess of 24b . 
  so you 're saying we 're not allowed to criticise orban ? 
  by asking an american to back off ? 
  wow i 'm powerful !, 
  i control the world !, 
  the eussr hurr durr . 
  yes it does , my well articulate , elegant friend . 
  apple copyrighted rounded rectangles i believe , so ... 
  but the design comes from the road stop sign , so i doubt anyone could . 
  thank you for being an island of reason in a sea of trolls . 
   do you think we have deposited our political will in brussels because it acts as a middle man ? 
  that 's exactly what we do when we vote for european parliamentaries . 
  because the eu totally colonised hungary . 
  riiiiiiiiiight . 
  please stay where you belong , in r/the _ dolan, 
  eu laws are passed by the eu parliament and interestingly : `` however , it is stated in the treaties that distribution of seats should be `` degressively proportional '' '' [ source ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_in_the_european_parliament ) so small countries ( population wise ) proportionnaly have more parlementaries than big countries . 
  example : germany ( 80m people ) has 838.789 people per mep while hungary ( 10m people ) has 471.848 people per mep . 
  so a hungarian citizen is `` worth '' almost twice as much as a german one .

  `` fazakas noted the importance of european subsidies , adding that in the given period such subsidies had covered 99.8 percent of the cost of public development projects in hungary . '', 
   `` we gave you a train how dare you question anything we do ? '', 
    this kind of authoritarian bullshit from pro-eu people is why i 'm against serbia joining . 
  assuming you 're a serbian citizen , your opinion regarding serbia joining the eu is yours and legitimate but ... authoritarian bullshit really ? 
  because someone posted this on r/europe ? 
  by that logic there are no national budgets because the money comes from people and companies by the way of taxes ... 
  from net contributors ? 
  as i understand it , the eu fonds were used to built the subway , not the message .
