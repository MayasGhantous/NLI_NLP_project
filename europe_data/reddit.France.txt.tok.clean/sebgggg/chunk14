  i mean that 'd be fucking insane ) , and assuming it `` softens '' iran , i wonder how that would affect ksa ? 
  you forgot one possibility . 
  we let vlad slaugh ... 
  i mean , bring russian freedom there . 
  your flair is pure , unaltered genius ... no homo but marry me ? 
  kinda like brexit . 
  we could if we made a 2 tier eu ... 
  watch out !, 
  there 's an emu behind you !, 
  makes sense , he behaves likes a 5yo . 
  mitigated by his proximity with vlad . 
  well i agree that willing , interesting , rewarding work is good . 
  but historically that does n't seem to reflect the human condition . 
  thanks !, 
  unless something is lost in translation , i do n't see how work makes you free ... 
  i mean slaves ? 
  chinese factories ? 
  europe 's 19th century mines ? 
  and so on ... 
   considering over 140.000 victims of the francoism are still `` missing '' all over spain ( 2nd biggest number in the world after cambodia ) , i 'd say 40 years is a good reason to be even more angry . 
  and even nowadays , most of our political parties just say that it 's better `` not to reopen old wounds '' and let things be as they are . 
  in what context ? 
  judging officials at the time ? 
  sorry i 'm fairly ignorant of spain 's history . 
   i f *** ing despise the political class of my country . 
  fairly sure we all do . 
  we 're fucked . 
  not to mention they dared invade russian donbass !, 
  that 's an excuse to skip work and drink wine . 
  you have to be german to believe that ... 
  better late than never !, 
  it 's one of hitler 's horcruxes . 
  geopolitics are not hard science , but i agree . 
  but in its decline , its getting agitated ... 
  * ominous * hon hon hon, 
  `` moderate '' . 
  and it 's a disease . 
  or if you prefer a deviancy . 
  and up to a point . 
  if you slaughter your offspring , your genetics will go from 100 to 0 real quick . 
  you 're right , i do n't believe he is the same as lepen who is financed by russia ... 
  but he seems to be [ quite close to putin ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/presidentielle/les-primaires/francois-fillon-l-ami-de-vladimir-poutine-21-11-2016-2084557_3122.php ) . 
  what we were talking about . 
  sure . 
  thankfully genetics are n't absolute , that could be one measure of cousciouness and free will . 
  but we do have a universal , self-evident starting point . 
  [ well ... ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/even-3-year-olds-have-sense-justice ) not so clear cut . 
  sure abstract ethic reasoning is n't natural . 
  nevertheless , it could be born from evolutionnary behavior . 
  well too bad for you , we 're sending our 5 tanks to estonia !, 
  france stronk !, 
  both favorites candidates for next may election are pro-russia . 
  i thought torture was fairly well established as non moral/ethical . 
  `` we hold these truths to be self-evident ... '' edit :  much better to logically reason someone to a position than play to their emotions . 
  which is exactly what he did . 
  i do n't disagree with your argument , it 's just ... 
  sad . 
  you forgot arrogant and sarcastic , sore loser :-), 
  i 'm afraid france will switch sides shortly :-(, 
  ... you have to be fucking kidding me . 
  the worse is , i 'm sure they do a decent job compared to some humans . 
  and cost a lot less . 
  ho i took that as a given . 
  i mean he said so much things that are ... 
  unrealistic . 
  and having no administration , it was obvious that he 'd lean on willing republicans , whom i hope , will keep him grounded . 
  sure why not ? 
  `` in other news , the comments of redditor u/yrzc could destroy the eu '', 
  so you 're one of [ those people ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/stubbs_ ( cat \\ ) ), 
  it 's not them or the military that worry me . 
  it 's trump and his administration . 
  and trump should know that , cia report and all ... 
   uh ... but while you related hiv with hitler , you failed to relate hitler with federal europe . 
  let 's start a train here . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) - if you take federal and remove the `` de '' of `` deutchland uber alles '' from it , you get feral . 
  poor cat :-d well , it still seems to be more reasonable than the brit press , does n't it ? 
  so farage 's days are numbered . 
   fillon is a fraud . 
  yes . 
   needs to be le pen fuck no . 
   , ~ ~ otherwise ~ ~ * either way * it will be the same old shit . 
  ... yeah , i meant my brilliant , godly joke . 
   he convinced trump that torture is completely ineffective for getting intel and that bribery works best . 
  i 'd rather have him convinced trump on little things like moral and values , but well , i 'll take that ( not that the arguments are unsound ! ), 
  sorry , terrible , shity [ meta joke ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/dxosj/what_word_or_phrase_did_you_totally_misunderstand/c13pbyc/?st=iw7kzmyv&amp;sh=24e1e9f7 ), 
   `` democracy is the worst system in the world - except for all the others '' - france is bacon, 
  ho and judging by gdp , russia is also a sub-italy country hon hon hon, 
  with a side of snails :-), 
   give it time . 
  at least russian cartoonists do n't get killed . 
  at least we 're a real country , not poor-balkanic-sub-italy :-), 
  assuming you 're sarcastic , no it 's not perfect , but it 's not that bad either . 
  for example , opposition 's leaders do n't get headshot 'd in the capital . 
  and i like the soviet art-style . 
  in that case , i vote for the pussy riots as president , and `` putin shit himself '' as national anthem . 
  ~ ~ yet france has more unemployed people than uk or germany and has less inequalities . ~ ~ [ wiki says otherwise ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth ) well . 
  all of that to hide `` uk tries to destroy the eu '', 
  misleading title . 
  it aims websites which present themselves as neutral and informative , even offering support and counsel to pregnant women , while in fact lying and guilt tripping them . 
  fuck these fuckers and nothing to do with freedom of speech .
