   or tibet because china  or the other 200 + similar regions of the world ? 
  this is just hypocrisy . 
  that 's realpolitik , you do what you can with what you have . 
   listen , i am all for dealing with the colonies that belong to the chosen people , but remember the last time europeans went around labeling things as juden or not ? 
  guilt tripping much ? 
  labeling products made by cheap labour in illegally occupied territories has nothing to do with the shoah . 
   it 's not going to end well and this is unethical . 
  it will probably have little effect at all and i do n't see any ethic problem with labeling products on their geographic origin . 
  you must be high . 
  this is the national translation of an eu directive 2 . 
  calling for boycott of israel is [ illegal in france ] ( http://mobile.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/11/06/l-appel-au-boycott-de-produits-israeliens-est-illegal_4804334_1653578.html ), 
  edit : in reply to `` what about boycotting saudi arabia ? '', 
  i 'm all for it . 
  we ca n't rush fast enough to all electric transport and take our distances with these `` allies '' . 
  whatever its faults , at least israel is somewhat democratic . 
   supporting the settlements and boycotting companies ( people ) operating there are 2 complete different things . 
  one could even stretch things so far as saying these things are contradictory my dear watson . 
   this will just damage ~ ~ common people : israeli and palestinian who operate or are employees in ~ ~ these companies . 
  israeli who operate these companies which employs palestinians . 
  ftfy  why single out israel ? 
  does the same thing exists for example for northern cyprus or the latest crimea just to take 2 examples that are near ? 
  fine by me , although afaik turks are n't using greeks as cheap labour , same goes for crimea . 
   the outrage is n't really the labelling itself but the decision to do so only here . 
  there are 200 territorial disputes in the world and the eu rather than passing a general law which applies to all - did n't . 
  meh  it was realpolitik to an extent though . 
  yes  that is n't most of the outrage though - the actual outrage though is that is europe and labelling our stuff is extremely sensitive as it 's sort of a historical reminder of the previous labells . 
  utter and total bullshit . 
  equating mandatory david 's star and product labeling , really ? 
  and fyi calling for boycott of israel is [ illegal in france ] ( http://mobile.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/11/06/l-appel-au-boycott-de-produits-israeliens-est-illegal_4804334_1653578.html ) which is ridiculous . 
  the country of origin is already indicated , what is new is simply the distinction between israel and the colonies . 
  antisemites probably do n't buy from israel at all anyway . 
  he lost . 
  fillon is the right-wing candidate . 
   screw fillon . 
  more of the same . 
  another merkel . 
  yes . 
   if it 's not le pen , we are doomed . 
  companies have proven time and again that they 're willing and able to distort science in the way they wish ( tobacco ? ) . 
  but ok i 'll take your point , i 'm no scientist , ( well til ... a quick lookup on wiki tells ld50 is indeed higher for salt than glyphosate . 
  still roundup is more than glyphosate ) , as i said , health concerns are only part of the problem . 
  the real problem is about ip and the power it gives to biotech companies . 
  in french : http://www.eau-et-rivieres.asso.fr/media/user/file/pdf/20070126_extrait_jugement_monsanto.pdf, 
  how true !, 
  it 's not like ceos ruining their companies and shareholders could leave with millio ... ho . 
  wait . 
  huh ? 
  you mean less ? 
  but that 's not what is implied here . 
  and monsanto was condemned for claims about roundup non-toxicity . 
   well if they * suspected ties * best to ~ ~ burn them at the stake now . ~ ~ make them drink roundup . 
  as for the suspicion , i have n't dug that far , but i think the quote is more than telling ... 
  i mean , a total herbicide , healthier than salt , * really * ? 
  and it 's not about punishment , it 's about impartiality and honesty . 
  if someone is paid by monsanto and advocates gmo , fine , but that should be disclosed . 
  and anyway , regardless of health concerns , gmos are shit ... 
   fillon will make overtures about immigration and integration but do nothing . 
  so le pen is thenonly real choice . 
  if you are nostalgic of the 3rd reich , it is indeed the only real choice , as marine never condemned her father 's stance . 
   and no , france can not be maintained with a third world population growing inside it . 
  this is obvious . 
  i agree , there 's way too much russians in france ... who finance marine again ? 
  article written by marcel kuntz , a french researcher , member of `` association fran\u00e7aise pour l'information scientifique '' , which is suspected to have ties to monsanto . 
  afis president said : `` roundup is less toxic than aspirin or salt and moreover is biodegradable '' .

  guillotine !, 
  well , not gon na lie , that hurt ... or it would have if you were able to place france on a map ... or read a map ... or read ...

   also , even if the eu puts tariffs on uk exports , i would not put any tariffs on any eu imports . 
  really ? 
  ok so you do that . 
  now let 's pretend i 'm say nissan . 
  why would i bother making cars following both uk and eu regulations ? 
  it has a cost : legal , ingeneering , process stream lining and al. 
  and for what ? 
  a market of 60m on one hand and another of 440m ... 
  but ok fine , maybe it 's still profitable ... now let 's say i 'm france , germany or poland , countries that have car factories . 
  and i decide to impose a 3000 % tariff on uk made cars ... what do you think nissan would do ? 
  stay in uk ? 
  or move to eu , in a country that has a car industry where it can integrate , follow one set of regulations , within a single market of 440m ? 
  nissan is just an example ... 
  hint : unilateral religious liberalism is for dummies . 
  i suppose they went to uk because , regardless of reality , their perception is that it 's easier to find work there even if you do n't speak the language ... 
  you drank too much tea and now you 're angry and shouting and you hurt my eyes !, 
  and i 'm french , i wank all day !, 
  and while wanting to control immigration is not necessarily racist , studies shows immigrants have a positive impact on the economy so why the anger ? 
  haaaa earl grey farts ... another of our atavic fetishes, 
   good lord , a true parisian wannabe ... have not met one of them in a while . 
  worse . 
  paris suburbs no-go zones :-)  i would offer you a longbowmans salute , but i can not be bothered to look up the gif . 
  i am indeed the son of a hamster , and my mom smelled like elderberries :-)  still you are a sysadmin i think , and use linux , so you cant be all bad , however i would never use your keyboards . 
  the feeling is mutual , and i bid you a good day fellow linux admin/user :-), 
  but freudian slips are supposed to be an expression of the unconscious , i proudly live by my tea-people-drowning-themselves-wank fetish , as any french with a measure of self-respect would , dear chap :-), 
  i 'm afraid i fail to see it dear chap , care to enlighten me ? 
  france , religious and sexually repressed ?
