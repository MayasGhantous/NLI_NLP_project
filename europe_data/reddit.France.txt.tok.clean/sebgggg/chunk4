  designing gmo as a trap for farmers ( and possibly their neighbours ) to sell them herbicide/pesticide is more like it . 
   how dumb do you think farmers are ? 
  nothing to do with smarts , and everything to do with power imbalance . 
  well i suppose you mean people are wealthier and the economy more or less works . 
  but inequalities are huge , and the oligarchs control everything that matters . 
  and putin control the oligarchs . 
  so it looks like russia returned to before the perestroika , do n't you agree ? 
  in effect , badly . 
   why do you want to be able to choose ? 
  why not ? 
  and why go this road when we could feed everyone by just eating less meat which is healthier and better for the environment ? 
   no incentives sounds a lot like no demand . 
  no demand because people do n't know . 
   no mandated vegetarian labels in the uk but plenty of vegetarian labeled food can be bought . 
  how should the government decide what is labelled ? 
  good question and i do n't have the answer . 
   why should companies have to deal with this stigma when there is nothing wrong with their products ? 
  we get back to the mad cow thing , they could have said the same thing before it exploded . 
  no idea about health issues but regardless i 'd like to be able to choose . 
  and of course companies wo n't label it voluntarely because they have no incentives to . 
  haha i watched it without sound , so no idea . 
   sorry i 'm not really following your point . 
  are you actually saying the government should mandate that it is included in the labelling what food the animals eat ? 
  what else should be mandated ? 
  why should it be mandated ? 
  i said mutagen breeding should be labeled . 
  as for the rest , not really , it 's just that there is a huge lack of knowledge of the whole agricultural/agrobusiness in the public . 
  note that the public is as much to blame for that , and i do n't include myself in the knowledgeable group . 
   bear in mind it 's not just a matter of labelling meat , but also products that contain that meat or are produced in a plant or use equipment that was also used to process that meat . 
  products do n't even have to contain gmos as a primary ingredient to require gmo labelling . 
  well in the actual state of science , that 's useless for health information , but it can still matter to the consumer . 
  they should , but use and abuse are different things . 
  but that 's my point . 
  it was banned after the fact . 
  it killed a few people , a lot of cows , costed a lot of money and flamed the mistrust towards agrobusiness that gmos are encoutering . 
  had it been written on the meat , i do n't think that would have happened because people would not have bought that meat . 
   i think the paranoia surrounding gmos should stop . 
  just like gmo fanatism/shillism . 
   genetically modified organisms are as safe to eat as any other plants that were modified through natural selective breeding , and that 's forgetting that a lot of natural organisms are unsafe and unhealthy too !, 
   they can help boost production and alleviate world hunger , we do n't need gmos for that . 
   while also enriching farmers , not sure ( at least ) indians farmers agree . 
   and reducing dependence on foriegn countries . 
  fairly sure the west export a shitton of food . 
   and the consumer also benefits from better environmental conditions , healthier and cheaper food , and a larger variety of products all year round . 
  really ? 
  you could try to make a reasonable argument for gmo but presenting it as a perfectly safe magic bullet is screaming bullshit . 
   i can understand concerns about organizations with malicious intent overlooking issues within their gmo products , or even with corporations pricing out poorer farmers , it is n't `` overlooking issues '' . 
  designing gmo as a trap for farmers ( and possibly their neighbours ) to sell them herbicide/pesticide is more like it . 
   but i think these need to be solved with strong policing and a governmental ombudsman . 
  if that could truely be done , i 'd be ok with it . 
  you forgot to say sorry :-) but seriously i remember reading on reddit that it was the case . 
  or i misremembered and it was organic labels not allowing mutation breeding . 
   this is n't a gmo exclusive issue , plants that are created from cross-breeding can be patented as well ( which is actually more of an issue than with gmos ) . 
   in either case , do you not think it makes sense that if a producer spends a lot developing a new food product they should be able to protect that ip ? 
  what is the incentive to create such products if the ip is not protected ? 
  similar issues in the medical drug world really . 
  funny you take pharma as an example because they spend more in marketing than in research . 
  they also artificially extend patents duration by making insignificant changes to their drugs formulas . 
  thanks . 
  # [ ** russia has no borders ** ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=btlhvyoynxi ), 
   sure , it 's a political judgement i 'm making . 
  at the end of the day there is limited space for such messages on products , so if there is to be a mandated label it should only be for these reasons . 
  that 's your legitimate pov . 
   producers and consumers are well within their rights to voluntarily add labels if there is a demand for it , as there is for instance with vegetarian food , or religious products ( kosher , halal ) . 
  but these should be voluntary and demand driven . 
  that 's for the law to say . 
   there 's also the whole issue of the stigma attached to labelling . 
  people question why there is a need to do so , is this product less healthy ? 
  such labelling is n't mandated unless it has a nutritional or allergen impact , that 's the standard . 
  in the case of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy , it was because we were feeding deceased diseased cows to living ones . 
  that was a health issue . 
   why ? 
  do you think products should be labelled dependent on what food an animal eats as well , and equally useless information ? 
  labels are there to provide nutritional and allergen information , nothing else . 
  why nothing else ? 
  that 's a political decision . 
  and why not ? 
  in our capitalistic society , consuming may be more important than voting , so what if people want to make these choices ? 
  what if i do n't want to eat a cow fed with other dead cows ? 
   let me answer by citing myself , because it seems you have n't read my comments thoroughly either : it seems i have n't , sorry . 
    this is ** mutually beneficial ** to any non-ignorant person [ emphasis added ]  the only thing i 'm fighting here is the   you terk er moneyz for free and so stfu and gtfo . 
  it seems almost every thread about poland ( or any past eastern bloc country in eu ) < -  eu relations has these . 
  that 's all . 
  yep , agreed . 
  just as it 's unpleasant to hear that western europe are thieves ( not talking about you ) . 
   those kind of events are uncommon enough that they often make headline news and normally get delt with pretty quickly . 
  but drugs distribution is easy to control . 
   the paper linked in the le monde article is pretty vague about what it considers a conflict of interest and there is n't that many other papers that come to that conclusion . 
  bear in mind these kind of allegations a made about pretty much everything even climate change . 
  even if it was correct 60 % would n't be and given that scientists overwhelmingly agree that gmos are safe we can be fairly confident of that . 
  which only means current gmos are inocuitous afawk for consumption , nothing more . 
   and once again , the spread of genes is n't unique to gmos . 
  so far , agriculture has survived millennia of horizontal gene transfer events . 
  yes . 
  but the time scale is different . 
   one example is the [ sweet potato ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/05/404198552/natural-gmo-sweet-potato-genetically-modified-8-000-years-ago ) which had several transgenes randomly inserted into its genome 8,000 years ago via agrobacteria . 
  some sweet potato cultivars even have a bt transgene that was naturally inserted into their genome , very similar to the popular bt trait that has been deliberately introduced into crop plants . 
  did n't know that particular case . 
   all gm traits come at a metabolic cost to the plant , and * most * gm traits are n't evolutionarily advantageous in the wild , making them * unlikely * to persist outside of agriculture . 
  but that 's part of the problem , a nuclear power plant is * unlikely * to blow up but if it does , you have a problem .
