  i 'm all for eu solidarity but calling the eu thieves seems a bit rubbish do n't you agree ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you low class troll . 
  regardless of who they critic , they very rarely lose their trial , because they have sources and proofs . 
   most countrys joined for the financial benefits quoting u/fluchtpunkt :  then they simply joined the wrong club . 
  they should have joined efta and the eea instead of the eu . 
   not for surrendering their identitys and rights , ho bollocks . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  you must have forgot your meds . 
  yes , you 're right eu is the 4th reich . 
  rubbish , that was a slogan , akin to drain the swamp . 
   errr since when fillon is russophile ? 
  it 's not because he wants to stop the sanction , that he is russophile . 
  cut the stereotype and over simplification , it 's very annoying . 
  those sanction also heavily affect french economy . 
  [ come on , he 's all buddy buddy with vlad . 
  fine . 
  [ private sellers at gun shows then ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_show_loophole ), 
  fine . 
  [ private sellers at gun shows then ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_show_loophole ), 
  what a pertubated cunt child . 
   ** i stand back in amused amazement !, 
  ** not far enough , could you back away a bit more ? 
  that was a joke , iznogood is a character in a cartoon . 
   if you ca n't see the fact that most terrorist attacks that have occurred recently are a byproduct of islamist interpretation combined with recruiting and indoctrination from people working in europe and abroad , in part yes . 
   i really ca n't discuss this with you . 
  i 'm not forcing you to . 
   [ the fact that not all muslims are conducting the attacks is irrelevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynof7y-kuhe ), 
  there are several millions muslims in france , so saying it 's a race problem or a cultural does n't mean anything . 
  for example rate of religious practice is equivalent between the three religions in france which is around 7 % . 
  yes . 
  i 'm not saying it should be underestimated but it should n't be overestimated either . 
  yes it is a problem that needs to be addressed , but bear in mind that part of it is teenage rebellion . 
  but he looked the hairy part !, 
  that 's helpful . 
  some may be . 
  most are n't . 
  yes and no . 
  the picture framed by the far-right is very biaised at best , most of muslims , arabs immigrants/french descendants are integrated and just live their lives . 
  and yes there is a problem , but it will not be solved by throwing ourselves away into excessive fear , xenophobia and hate . 
  my point is n't that we should ` nt be afraid , it 's that fear should be proportionate to the danger . 
  it 's quite clear that part of our societies want to go too far . 
  you should also fear being killed by an asteroid because that 's possible , so you should n't go the christmas market in the first place . 
  got you . 
  but we should fear it a lot less than suicide , car accident , stroke , tobacco , alcohol ... 
  the thought crossed my mind . 
  source ? 
  the number of crazy conspiracy theorists in this thread is too damn high !, 
  the sun has been talking shit for a while so ... and also laughter kills fear , if everyone laughed at these retarded terrorists , people might not join them so easily . 
  you could say the sun 's xenophonia ( \u2022 _ \u2022 ) ( \u2022 _ \u2022 )  \u2310 \u25a0 - \u25a0 ran into a pole ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) yyyyyyyeeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh anyway , props to the good man , and sympathies to his loved ones . 
  not that much really . 
  putin and the french far-right share at least part of their ideology ( christian nationalism ) lepen wants money to run her campaign . 
  putin wants support from europe and sow confusion . 
  so putin funds her , she speaks his narrative , and if she 's elected , he 's got himself an ally , who wo n't speak for ukraine . 
  gib money for clay . 
   your own article says that 's illegal in several states , let me pass state border , buy gun , come back . 
   plus it 's already illegal if the person is selling to a prohibited person . 
  gun shows do n't check . 
   what 's your point anyway ? 
  other countries allow gun shows and private sales and again do n't have the same level of gun violence as the usa . 
  let 's not forget the atf is prohibited by law to computerize gun ownership database . 
  the cdc is forbidden to research on such issues . 
  if the fbi does n't deny the purchase before 3 days , you have your gun . 
  the point is that your argument usa = = eu is wrong , wrooong . 
  oversimplified version : lepen : gib money putin : gib clay lepen : oui putin : da, 
   no but it will make the us military think twice about going fash if there 's 100 million ar-15 's out there and people willing to resist . 
  top kek . 
  cause your ar-15 will protect you from the us military ? 
  kek . 
  still hard not to connect the dots though ... 
  you mean the alt-right bots ? 
  who cares about them . 
  it seems fast and convenient , so yeah i doubt too . 
  still possible though , i guess . 
  it 's time to ban shitposting across reddit !, 
  heroes chase milfs and murder pussies , so it 's understandable . 
  do n't know about estonia but poland benefited from +100 b $ plus the cap plus polish immigrants sending money home plus investments made possible/facilitated by the eu . 
  note that i 'm not complaining , solidarity/development is one of eu 's purpose . 
  wow new account , who would have guessed ? 
  a troll without courage , go elsewhere . 
  thanks to the eu !, 
  she 's painting * over * racists/nazi tags . 
  how is that degrading the public property ? 
  refusing to sell is illegal . 
  how so ? 
  yes there is too much ideology and greed in the way economy politics are designed . 
  while i agree it would be nice and could be useful , i suspect qe for europeans banks is done on the same [ scale as in the us ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2011/09/20/the-feds-16-trillion-bailouts-under-reported/#3bd41a886877 ) because they fucked up so much . 
  and i do n't think qe for businesses is a bad thing but it 's probably misused . 
  yes but i do n't see the connection with religion . 
   printing money and giving it to friends and  religions . 
   is that the federal eu people are calling for ? 
  it 's an [ industry ] ( http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer ) like any other . 
   oh yes , the country with the highest prison population ~ ~ per capita ~ ~ in the world . 
  yes , more than say china . 
  not at all . 
  in fact , if you have more maybe on other eras , you should post it !, 
  that 's an interesting and entertaining read , thanks !, 
  true . 
  but some people never accepted that , and i 'm more refering to the child-talk aspect .
