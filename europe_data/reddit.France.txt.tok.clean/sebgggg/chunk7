  `` are you tired of this scum ? 
  this is the worst scum , believe me , i know scum . 
  i 'm going to karcher - and i have the best karchers , trust me , people tell me nico you have the most beautiful karchers - anyway , so , yeah , let me grab your pussy '', 
  a french politician speaking like trump would be politically dead . 
  [ unless they speak in english :-) ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m_zup4qfgjo ), 
  do n't get your hopes too high :-), 
  i did n't mean life-changing as much as something you can see everyday . 
  it 's nice to hear that people benefit from the eu in their everyday lives :-), 
  we are too !, 
  care to share some of these projects , like those of which would change your everyday life ? 
   at least we have the * second * best cheese ftfy, 
  i do n't think so , it 's more that some of them just do n't care about the rest of the world , i think . 
  the site is a government one and it has a phone number for the uk , maybe they can help ? 
  wish you both the best !, 
  [ found this ] ( http://www.cleiss.fr/particuliers/venir/vacances/index_en.html ) `` as a general rule , the caisse will directly cover 80 % of your hospital expenses and in some cases 100 % . 
  if you showed your ehic or a provisional replacement certificate when you were admitted , ** you will not have to pay upfront ** and will only be responsible for the copayment , which is 20 % if you have 80 % coverage , plus an 18 $ fee for each day you were hospitalized . 
  if you have 100 % coverage , you will have to pay the 18 $ daily fee . '', 
  ~ ~ has he tried discussing it with the hospital ? 
  it could be possible to find an agreement like the hospital gives him a bill , he gets the money from the nhs then pays the hospital ... ~ ~ saw your other answer . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  my sympathies to your friend . 
   to all french people here : could you please explain us what are the exact consequences of the state of emergency for the citizens ? 
  at the top of my head , i think the most important aspect is that it lifts certain restrictions or obligations for investigations related to terrorism and delegates certain powers from the judicial power to the executive one . 
  e.g : police can home search at night with prefect 's order rather than a judge 's , people can be kept at home , gatherings/protests can be forbidden , etc  does it affect your everyday life ? 
   how does a 12 year old kid end up wanting to kill others with a * nail * bomb ? 
  bravo . 
    the uk 's leadership look like blustering idiots with no idea what they are doing or where they are going . 
   in the 21st century and after continued exposure to social media , ` the public ' have tricked themselves into believing that every important event unfolds over the course of a few weeks much in the same way the olympics or a natural disaster does . 
  it only appears as though the uk government is incompetent in this aspect because of drama-focused 24-hour news coverage and social media which allows in a drought of information the passing comments of a minor minister to be presented as an official statement . 
  while i agree in general , on this particular case it seems clear that neither remain/leave nor labour/tory/ukip thought leave would win and had any real plan . 
  and in my view , the government looks like a bunch of headless chickens running around ... 
   there is no such thing as a `` power vacuum '' in that capacity and never has been . 
  and never will be . 
  power is a dynamic thing , if you do n't exert it , it decays . 
  what 's worrying is that a number of americans do n't see this . 
  my thoughts exactly, 
  agreed . 
  but tourism is n't sufficient for a sound economy , they also need investment in other sectors . 
  and we love you too brothers in cheese :-) well when you put it like that , it kinda seem a double standard . 
  but do n't forget they have a border with libya , which is n't the most stable or secure place in the world . 
  ^ ( thanks in part to the glorious intervertion pushed by sarkozy ), 
  i do n't know , foreign ministries do these recommandations based on the intel they have and with their citizens 's security in mind . 
  but we should have helped them from the beginning ... 
  the tourist 's reaction is understandable . 
  and tourism is down in france too . 
  but we should definitely support them as much as we can . 
  you mean danke . 
  / s and yes if erdogan was the worm , much dank . 
  but he does n't give a shit about the eu anyway . 
  wow shilling whataboutism !, 
  there are suspicions that they stole that money and recently hid some , among a lot of shady shit . 
  so yes , very close to poor people .

  so close to the people ... 
   the sacred alliance sacred alliance is against terrorism or foreign ennemies . 
  against fn it 's called the republican front . 
   it 's a terrible state of politics in europe when only people like these ~ ~ are ~ ~ * pretend to be * in touch with the voter base ftfy . 
   tunisia should be built by tunisian people as the role model they see fit for themselves , not to accommodate eu demands . 
  yes . 
  not to model after ksa either . 
   using money to shape the future of tunisia is just old european supremacy painted with a layer of good intentions . 
  trading and investing with/in tunisia could benefit everyone . 
  absolutely this comment and its parent . 
  and france should spearhead this . 
  amen brother !, 
  i was joking . 
  trump is n't going to cancel anything . 
  i hope not . 
  we all need a reasonable brexit , without punition nor favor . 
  do it or do not but quit bargaining like a kid throwing a tantrum it 's insufferable . 
  we need an european army . 
  just adding germany , france , uk , italy you have a ~ 200b budget , china has 200b and us has 600b , so that would be very decent . 
  not gon na happen though . 
  :-( edit : the budget thing is just to give an idea . 
  i think we could make a mandatory self-defense european army , with a direct tax for budget , plus direct recruitment for any willing eu citizen , which sole purpose is to defend the eu member 's territory . 
  that protects a bit from a nationalist , though ultimately , in democracy it depends on the people . 
  then a regular optional eu army , where each country contribute , under eu command . 
  and each country keep part of its army , and is free to act on will . 
  ping u/crocpb , u/mimo _ shel, 
  nope . 
  it 's designed to launch its reactor at the ennemy to give us time to flee !, 
  awesome tech . 
  yeah i read an interesting article about that , but the program is very much under us control with its tier system , which allows them to split costs a bit and still keep allies dependent on them . 
  i mean they 'd be crazy not to anyway . 
  [ we do ] ( https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_de_gaulle_ ( porte-avions ), 
  but that being said , i suppose it 's ( f35 ) sort of a good thing from an eu perspective , because we have a broader range of weapons and maybe a peek in us techno but for spain , it means being dependent on them . 
  i asked that question knowing in my head it 's a no . 
  no problem at all :-)  afaik the rafale series of aircraft are catobar only . 
  so no ski jumps since there 's not enough power to let them fly off the ship without the catapults . 
   the spanish navy 's aircraft carrier looks like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_ship_juan_carlos_i ) . 
  i doubt the rafale could work on that . 
  atm i see little option for most carrier nations save for a select few to replace their aircraft but for the f-35b no problem at all , we can sell them nuclear carriers too !, 
  if they 're nato compatible i 'd say probably but i do n't know ... 
  hey kid !, 
  want a rafale ? 
  traditionnally , us runs the world bank and europe runs the imf . 
  and for a long time , germany was n't much politically because of ww2 . 
  i hope things will quiet down after article 50 ... 
  and do n't forget eu = = 4 ^ th reich !, 
  what a load of crap .
