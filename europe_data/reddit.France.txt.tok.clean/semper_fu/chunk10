  my sister even failed her driving licence the first time because she had supposedly done that and the examiner had used that expression as well ( she swears she did n't of course ) . 
  the world has gotten small . 
  everyone is my neighbor . 
  i 'll add a few : * c'est pas le p\u00e9rou ( * it 's not peru * ) : it 's not much , it 's mediocre . 
  * faire son stop \u00e0 l'am\u00e9ricaine ( * stopping at a stop sign like an american * ) : slowing down but not actually stopping at the stop sign . 
  * la branlette espagnole ( * spanish `` hand job '' * ) ... when a man and a woman like each other very much and the lady 's breasts are large enough ... * filer \u00e0 l'anglaise ( * run the british way * ) : run away discreetly . 
  i 've taken to using the old slang for the francs . 
  i so wish i could go back to living in [ strasbourg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strasbourg ) . 
  it 's the perfect city for me : it 's close enough to my home town that i could visit regularly but far enough to avoid unexpected visits ( 2 hours drive ) . 
  les vosges are close by , so is germany ( strasbourg-kehl is super quick , even when using the city bus like i did as a student ) . 
  it 's just such a gorgeous city . 
  of course , it 's a pretty touristy city but where i live now is even worse so ... 
  is there really no , i do n't know what word to use , not pride but some ... 
  i do n't know , sense of ` belonging ' , maybe to what used to be the ddr ? 
  you know we got to vote on what the new name was going to be . 
  one of the choice was nouvelle [ austrasie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrasia ) . 
  which i thought was pretty cool , with a nice historical ring to it but noooo . 
  and you know what 's the one thing people did n't like about it ? 
  `` we ca n't call ourselves austrasie , that sounds too much like australie '' . 
  now that 's an interesting question . 
  i do n't know how it is in germany but in france the line that divides northern and southern france depends on who you 're talking to . 
  i had a friend from marseilles and he un-sarcastically considered anything north of avignon as `` le nord '' ( granted , he was a bit extreme ) . 
  my boyfriend 's grandfather from nowhere , central france is incapable of making the distinction between the alsace-lorraine region and le nord / pas de calais ( as in , lille , dunkerque , all that ) . 
  still not sure if stupid or just doing it to piss me off . 
  * my * division line starts around nantes . 
  i consider lyon in the south , someone else may consider lyon northern ... xd but usually , `` le nord de la france '' refers to what is now les hauts-de-france region . 
  ca n't believe eastern people went for that lame ass name ` grand-est ' ... but i digress . 
  edit : as for the stereotypes about brittany and normandy , i 'm not sure . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 'm full of prejudices against brittany but that 's just because i 'm sick of seeing their flag everywhere . ^ / s, 
  not for that particular stereotype no , i meant the nord-pas-de-calais former region mostly . 
  there was this [ big criminal case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/outreau_trial ) in 2004 that did nothing to help with those stereotypes ( even though the vast majority of the people accused turned out innocent ) . 
  * people from norhtern france : alcoholics , incestuous . 
  * north eastern french : lovely * german * people ( have been called a boche a few times on the rare occasions i visited some family down south : `` where do you come from ? '', 
  [ answers ] `` oh , you 're practically german ! '' ), 
  * parisians : rude assholes who ca n't drive . 
  * marseilles : crime lords from corsica, 
  aaow , man . 
  while i always thought resistance could get away with a few more rules for some reason 2/3 of the group of friends i usually play with tend to lose half their brain when we play that game . 
  so i 'll find smarter friends , then i 'll play the game . 
  got it \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  yes , i was speaking of battlestar galactica and if it 's like resistance then i 'll definitely check it out next time i head to the game store !, 
  thanks, 
  is it really ? 
  i meant to try it out with a couple of friends because i 'm a huge fan of the show but ... you know , never did . 
  i think it 's safe to say 7 wonders is relatively popular here . 
  my favorite is the resistance : avalon . 
  love that game . 
  riiiight , i had forgotten about louisiana !, 
  now , \u00e0 propos de l'accent qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ... you know how some accents can be really hot ? 
  ( i have a thing for the spanish and italian accents ) . 
  the quebecois accent is n't of of them ( to me anyway ) . 
  when i can understand what the people are saying , i find it amusing . 
  one day i watched a news show whose anchor had a pretty thick accent and man , nothing that woman said sounded serious to me . 
  i kept giggling at the funny pronunciations , no matter what horrible topic she was talking about . 
  it 's childish , i know . 
  i would n't know . 
  there are n't many americans with french ancestry ( never met any ) . 
  * ( edit : had n't thought about louisiana . 
  i stand corrected ) * as for the french canadians , it 's a little different is n't it ? 
  qu\u00e9bec being a thing and them trying to preserve some form of cultural identity vs the overwhelming english speaking majority of the country ? 
  vive la france ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iazfvfdietk ) said de gaulle . 
  i think you wo n't find many french disagreeing with that statement . 
  there is a real sympathy for our canadian cousins , 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9xzrraqfza ) xd, 
  that 's a mistake many french would make . 
  it 's similar to mistaking * j' aurai * ( futur simple ) and * j' aurais * ( conditionnel ) . 
  you ca n't hear the difference so the mistake is understandable . 
  i 've only just started studying spanish ( like a month ago ) . 
  i 'm enjoying it , it 's fun  if you 've studied french you probably heard of it but the tv series kaamelott is a gold mine of french colloquialisms ( and is actually very funny ) . 
  `` va te faire chier '' is n't a thing . 
  it would be understood as `` go get bored somewhere '' . 
  `` se faire chier '' can mean to be bored . 
  it can also be used when you try to convey the fact that you put a lot of effort into something `` je me suis fait chier \u00e0 faire [ un truc ] '' . 
  and so , `` ne pas se faire chier '' means you 're being impolite . 
  would be an appropriate comment for someone cutting the line at the supermarket for example . 
  you 'd indeed say `` va te faire foutre '' ( no 's ' for the imperative form ) / `` va te faire enculer '' . 
  or use the euphemism `` va te faire voir chez les grecs '' . 
  which is indeed quite vulgar . 
  or , another possibilty is `` tu m 'em merdes '' , litt : you 're dirtying me with shit but it completely lost that meaning . 
  although `` o\u00f9 tu vas ? '', 
  `` me faire emmerder '' before someone says `` je t 'em merde '' . 
  that works . 
  thanks !, 
  the belgian accent is easily understandable ( and rightfully mocked ) . 
  feels like a different language altogether sometimes . 
  i 've never been much good with accents but i 've seen videos from quebec where i understood very little of what was being said xd the other day there were a couple of canadians next to me on the street , they talked with the weirdest mix of ( to me ) american souding english and distorted ( again to me ) french . 
  it was hilarious ( and very difficult to follow ) : o, 
  thanks a lot for the explanation . 
  my grandmother would have loved that expression indeed . 
  similarly we have `` va te faire cuire un oeuf '' ( go make yourself an egg ) . 
  i usually steam my asparagus a little before frying them , some cook them in water a bit . 
  i have another question !, 
  i was watching a video in spanish where one person got very annoyed with the other one and the dialogue went : - `` me voy !, 
  i can relate that to two different french expressions , i 'm wondering which one fits the intended meaning best . 
  when something bothers you very much , you say , '' \u00c7a me fait chier ! '', 
  ( litt : it makes me shit ) . 
  you could also say `` va chier '' ( litt : go take a shit ) . 
  note that it is possible to scream `` va chier '' to nobody in particular when something goes wrong . 
  i 've heard it a couple of times on various videos , i 'm curious ( also , love spanish cursing !,
