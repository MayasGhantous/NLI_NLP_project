  that was magical . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm very curious about the asparagus though . 
  it 's used as a semi offensive insult for tall people here . 
  also i 'm keeping the `` i shit on everything that wiggles '' . 
  * ( would you be so kind as to shift to second gear , fellow human person ) * * rabats-toi , merde !, 
  con de parigot , va. * ( please pull your car back , fellow french person from paris ) . 
  * * bougez vos miches de la gauche des escalators , enfoir\u00e9s de touristes * ( please , do not stay on the left side of the escalator , welcomed tourists ) . 
  it 's a good thing people use the brand `` sopalin '' and not the `` okay '' one ( i 'm guessing sopalin is much older ) . 
   ( on appelle \u00e7a du polystyr\u00e8ne en france ) . 
  * the specific type of jacket that are `` windproof '' are called k-way ( like the brand name ) . 
  at least they were in my youth . 
  and it 's also tradition they be hideous ( mine was purple and pink  _ < ! ), 
  * the word for refrigerator , `` frigo '' is an abbreviation of `` frigidaire '' ( some still say `` un frigidaire '' ) which was a brand of fridges . 
  one of my cousins did some research on that a few years ago and made a neat family tree . 
  as far as my father 's side is concerned , we 've gone back to the late mid 17th century . 
  this roughly coincides with the time our region became french . 
  i 'm not sure why we have n't gone back further , i 've always assumed becoming part of france maybe had meant some form of cluster fuck with the civil registry or something . 
  not sure . 
  because my family comes from a town that is like 10km away from actual belgium and not too far from luxembourg , you 'll see the normal little circles of migration from one village to the next with people marrying people from nearby towns and that includes some belgians and a few luxembourgians . 
  i 'm not sure about my mother 's side , nobody bothered doing the research , maybe i will take the time someday , i 'm actually pretty curious . 
  haha , reminds me of that time i thought i had outbrained america by ordering an apple cider and actually being served one ... turns out it 's just apple juice over there . 
  xd edit : i too thought root beer was disgusting . 
  in france someone is thinking about you when your ear is ringing !, 
  yeah , you 're probably right . 
  from what i 've read it 's to keep bad luck away so it makes sense to say it when you hope something goes without a problem . 
  come to think of it , most of the instances i heard it in were indeed times where something could have potentially go bad . 
  it seems to be a very ancient habit too !, 
  touching something made out of wood when wishing for something . 
  my mom would often do it . 
  she 'd start her sentence by saying `` je touche du bois '' ( i 'm touching wood ) and would actually look for something made of wood to touch ( usually her chair or the table so , not too far ) , then go on saying what she was hoping / wishing . 
  i use to do it without noticing too ... then i forced myself to stop because it 's really stupid :p i do n't think it 's * that * common though . 
  well , i enjoy southern germany very much . 
  bavaria 's awesome so is the tyrol region of austria . 
  it 's family friendly i think . 
  tons of nice hikes , cool people , great schnapps !, 
  i love playing greece in civ 5 ( that city state bonus is sweet ! ) . 
  for some reason , isabella from spain systematically gets on my nerve when brazil is always a fine neighbor . 
  * i have to admit i do enjoy trolling isabella by spreading shinto to spain ( she does n't like it when you do that ) *, 
  my hometown used to be a place where people would come to because of all the steel factories . 
  there were many waves of immigration , not sure of the order though . 
  lots of algerians and moroccans came , a few tunisians as well . 
  also many many many italians and portuguese . 
  for some reason my hometown kind of has embraced italy as an `` unofficial second culture '' . 
  often in the supermarket you 'll find special italian themed promos . 
  there is also a [ venetian carnaval ] ( http://www.mairie-longwy.fr/media/img/carnaval_04_1428372274.jpg ) every year . 
  also in a town nearby there is an annual italian film festival . 
  the portuguese seem like they prefer to remain among themselves . 
  you 'll find whole streets in nearby villages with only people with portuguese name . 
  that 's the same thing where i live here now actually ( different region ) . 
  culturally we 're fine , no tension has occurred because of cultural differences that i know of . 
  except for my dad who , because of illness was a tiny boy and was picked on at school ... mostly by kids of italian immigrants . 
  he was very bitter towards those `` damn italians '' . 
  all his life ... until his job took him to italy maybe a decade ago . 
  when i asked `` so , the italians ? 
  '' , `` lovely people '' he replied  politically , seeing as my hometown and the neighboring towns were mostly factory workers , it leaned very much to the left . 
  a neighboring town has had a communist mayor for decades now . 
  to my huge surprise , macron took the votes in my hometown as well and le pen scored decently but not as well as some other areas like my hometown . 
  on the whole , people get along fine . 
  i think it 's the first time i say this but my hometown is not a bad place to live in !, 
  anything written by emile zola will give good insight on that period of time ( late 19th century ) . 
  i 'm not very well read in french literature , i could n't recommend something more recent . 
  [ bamboula biscuits ] ( https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/0/93/14/83/20170420/ob_586fa5_biscuits-bamboula.jpg ) ( apparently , bamboula is a type of drum . 
  it 's also a pejorative term for a black person ) . 
  [ chocolat f\u00e9lix potin ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a9lix_potin#/media/file:f%c3%a9lix_potin_chocolat.jpg ) . 
  at the top right corner it says `` beaten and happy '' . 
  ok , that one 's very old, 
  one day strolling in small town , usa , i encountered an old dude who offered me lemonade because it was a very hot day . 
  so we 're on the front porch enjoying the drink when he asks where i 'm from . 
  so i tell him and he answers that he 's been there and all . 
  me , being polite asked `` oh really ? 
  where ? '', 
  i 'm not sure i can really express what i felt like when he answered `` normandy '' . 
  suddenly there was like lots of dust in my eyes you know \\ ^ \\ ^ , also hugs . 
  well , my grandmother 's father was a farrier in a small village in northern [ franche-comt\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franche-comt%c3%a9 ) , also they had a nice farm so no shortage of food . 
  so the germans would often come to have their horses taken care of . 
  they 'd eat in the house with everyone else . 
  few spoke french but apparently , most were nice and felt the need to express their disgust at hitler , finding very amusing non-verbal way to do so . 
  the fact that it 's so trivial and non epic is exactly why i love it so much \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  that 's so fascinating . 
  i mean , it 's not like finland is * that * far and yet i know so little . 
  mostly because i never bothered looking of course ( also , the few finns i met irl rarely talked about their country ... even when asked ! ), 
  histories of europe , that 'll keep me occupied during my vacation \\ o / . 
  thanks !, 
  really ? 
  that 's not a topic i went into with germans unless i knew them very well ( always made friends with the germans on my various study trips abroad ) . 
  when we did it was interesting though . 
  in particular there 's this one anecdote i love to tell about my grandmother 's family during the occupation because it humanizes the german soldiers in a way no history book ever has for me . 
  these conversations always ended in very emotional moments . 
  totally worth it . 
   picture window . 
  i had to google what that was , til . 
  i went back to look at a couple of old photos . 
  places i 've been to ( a couple of host families ) , mostly no curtains . 
  in any case , what i remember from my ( frequent , lonely ) walks in the village was how often i could see the inside of people 's house . 
  which i equate to no covering at all but blinds that are retracted will give that impression too . 
  also did the snooping on some american friends ' facebook . 
  retracted blinds , blinds , few curtains . 
  someone needs to make a study about this thing . 
  how does the estonianization of a name work ?
