  but when people start gathering , chanting , brandishing weapons and the likes ... it kind of feels hopeless , like it 's too late for reasonable exchanges of idea . 
  it 's depressing . 
  lovecraft was a very disturbed human being ... 
  i kind of wish more people thought the way you do when considering buying stuff from stores that are known to not do anything to stop horrible working conditions in their factories ( mostly in asia , mostly women and children ) . 
  but the truth is , people , unlike you it seems , manage it rather well . 
  they consider their budget , goes where they are offered the supposed best deal regardless of the consequences in terms of furthering an unfair system . 
  it 's too far away from most people 's daily concerns to matter . 
  working children may bring a tear in their eye but it wo n't stop them from buying that cheap top at h&m you know ? 
  i understand about a novelist or any other kind of artist , i think . 
  i mean , i read what c\u00e9line had to say about the jews , it very nearly made me puke . 
  i do not want to know or read more from that man , regardless of how beautiful it 's supposed to be ( i 've been treated like the dumbest person alive for that by very uppity literary people , i do n't care ) . 
  but when you buy a product from a company , the price of what you pay goes to so many people , many of whom probably do n't share the view of the ceo you disagree with and may support movement you agree with . 
  i guess it just boils down to personal choice . 
  ( also , never meant to imply the gesture was small or ridiculous , just in case ), 
  does this mean you are among the people who will not read stuff written by [ c\u00e9line ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis-ferdinand_c%c3%a9line ) ( link is not meant for you but for those who might not know of him , of course ) based on his very anti-semitic views ? 
  i never read anything by him mainly because of that so i 'm not criticizing . 
  however i see a difference between disagreeing with someone and choosing not to buy stuff from said person and boycotting an entire company . 
  that reminds me of how people wanted to stop using firefox because one of the founder ... something something anti gay marriage ? 
  ( i do n't recall too well , but it had to do with gay rights ) . 
  i did n't understand that . 
  the company was more than that one man you know ? 
  i did n't think that his personal opinion or who he decides to give money to would matter in a choice between one product or another . 
  it does n't for me anyway . 
  what 's the logic behind your choice ? 
  i 've tried chorizo many times . 
  i should like it , i love saucisson so much , i should enjoy the variety chorizo would provide ... 
  but no . 
  it 's the texture , i find it very , very unpleasant . 
  favorite american accent ? 
  italian brooklyn accent !, 
  favorite native anglo accent ? 
  ... scottish . 
  i do n't know why , i just like it ( when i can understand what they say , that 's not all the time ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ pa\u00eblla ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ chorizo, 
  i 'd heard the first one before but not the second one . 
  back then a french friend and i did our best shattering as many of these dreams as we could . 
  we considered it our mission so that they would n't feel horrible once they came to france like [ some do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ) and would be able to enjoy france for what it was . 
  ( this one is apparently used to help people with a lisp -- source : the wiki on tonguetwisters ) . 
  * belgium : best beer in the world . 
  also , only foreign country that almost feels like home . 
  * luxembourg : cheap gasoline and tobacco . 
  most luxembourgian are ... well , let 's just say people from my region do n't work in luxembourg because the people are lovely ...  * germany : second best beer in the world , decent bread (  :3 ) . 
  in general the first people i become friends with abroad ( and the belgians ) . 
  * switzerland : do n't know anything about switzerland , it 's already too far south . 
  * italy : same as switzerland . 
  though one day i 'll go there and sample real italian cuisine . 
  looking forward to it . 
  * spain : is the home of two of the dishes i hate most . 
  it 's not their fault though so i wo n't hold it against them . 
  only ever met and talked with one spanish person in my life . 
  when in the us , i 'd sometimes go to neighbor high schools , talk with the students that sort of thing . 
  the weirdest question i was asked then was : '' ** do you have windows ? ** '' . 
  my first answer was '' * yes , we have computers , of course * '' . 
  but then the person said '' * no , i mean windows to look outside ! * '' ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i just do n't know what went through that person 's head . 
  most of my discussions with japanese ladies in love with french culture pretty much ended in me shattering their dreams of a classy and romantic french person . 
  is that what this is ? 
  well , til . 
  ridiculous indeed . 
   - what kind of game your country 's women respond to ? 
  - is it easy to approach girls in your country ? 
  what the hell kind of questions are these ? 
  women are human beings who most likely will respond positively to being treated like a fellow human being , less positively when treated like game to be hunted . 
  i 've always wondered which country had the smartest men ... 
  it 's consistent with the post 's theme \\ ^ \\ ^ '', 
  the simple idea of a sauna makes me nervous ... confined space , too much heat . 
  yeah ... no :( i think there was one at the gym next to where i lived but honestly it looked more like a derelict tool shed , it was scary  _ <, 
  people who say * `` j'ai le seum * '' in front of me would be put to death ( it 's something them young people say ( used to say ? ), 
  when ... 
  i do n't know , they lose a game of crash royal or something ) . 
  yes . 
  also , going through my history i realized i 've been been attributing to you posts from another user whose account seems to have been deleted ( and whose username i ca n't remember , of course ) on top of those you actually made . 
  i do n't know if yesterday 's topic about czech was from you or not but ... to uneducated me , it looked like perfectly legitimate czech xd, 
  yes , i noticed that too xd incidentally your username is a good example of why i ca n't remember most usernames from the east ( as in east of france so i 'm including germany and austria in this ) : too many letters that are n't that frequent in french following each other . 
  like the string `` dkfa '' ... 
  i ca n't integrate it ( maybe if i tried by parts ? ) . 
  i 'm starting to recognize the czech flag though so that 's progress :p, 
  you know how when you read something you 'll sometimes read it in the voice of the characters that 's known for saying it ? 
  well . 
  there is this one [ french user ] ( https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xr890k ) ... o /, 
   it 's sad how the dutch language was killed off by the french government after ww2 . 
  so well i did n't even know it existed in france : o that campaign you mention seems like a good idea and so far from the typical flemish stereotypes . 
  there were two main dialects in my region . 
  the one that would have been spoken in my part , lorrain is a roman dialect and i have n't met a single person who could speak it ( not even my grand parents ) . 
  the platt ( a german dialect ) can be heard spoken by a few old people in moselle but that 's it . 
  moselle was german longer than the rest of lorraine , it 's probably why . 
  learning about catalonia and how spain is run made me rethink about regional dialects a bit which was n't a topic i knew well seeing as not even old people here can tell you about it . 
  which is sad , i agree . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  does * merci * mean something in particular in bulgaria ? 
  ( i tried looking it up but could n't find what it could mean ), 
  and we 're named after a [ germanic tribe ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/franken_ ( volk \\ ) ) . 
  i 'm seeing a pattern here . 
  a user from ~ ~ spain ~ ~ catalonia informed that there were schools where kids could learn in both french and catalan in the southern part of france that is the historical northern 1/5 of catalonia ( did i get it right ? ) . 
  after some digging i found out similar schools existed in brittany as well . 
  as for alsace , the local channel still airs some program in alsacien and i 'm pretty sure you could find the local paper in alsacien as well . 
  as for corsica , i 'd think many speak corse but i do n't know for sure . 
  l'injustice . 
  you know i used to think people who refused to speak anything but french were a myth until my sister came back from bulgaria .
