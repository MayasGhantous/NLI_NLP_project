  '' * nice country * '' she said '' * but can you believe nobody speaks french ? * '' . 
  she 's a silly little woman alright but that was just ... wow . 
  she was n't kidding you know ? 
  as for looking down on things not from france , i 'd like to say it 's a myth but my allergic reaction to chorizo says otherwise xd, 
  me rappeler : remind me ( not to write to ** you ** ( ** t ** ' \u00e9crire ) in english ) . 
  continue tes efforts !, 
  french people feel the same way . 
  i 've lived in the parisian area long enough for people at home to consider me a parisian ( i hate that they do ) . 
  friends who grew up in the parisian region still consider me a provincial though . 
  it 's silly . 
  i 'm guessing that would be us ... no ? 
  obviously french and english then by level of proficiency : * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e : enough to have a casual conversation , not enough to have a big philosophical debate about what infinity means . 
  also , am lazy so rarely work on my reading so i kinda suck at reading ( meaning that if there are no hint on how to read specific words , it can take me a while ) . 
  * deutsch : i studied it for 7 years at school and i still very much suck . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  i can ( and have ) get by in germany but it 's complicated . 
  for some reason when i started studying japanese it kind of overwrote on the german or something . 
  now , when i 'm trying to form a sentence in german if there is one word i do n't know ( 99.998 % chance of that happening ) , the word will come out in japanese and i wo n't be able to remember proper german grammar anymore . 
  * espa\u00f1ol : it 's very recent . 
  i started studying it 2 months ago as a way to productively procrastinate on the research i was doing at the time . 
  it 's surprisingly fun so i kept at it even after my research was done . 
  i bought myself a grammar book , keep on studying vocabulary and read articles in spanish everyday . 
  i made good progress as far as understanding it goes . 
  i 'd have to practice speaking it to improve that part but i do n't see that happening anytime soon so , for now , reading and listening is enough . 
  * non arab muslims . 
  i met plenty abroad ( mostly from indonesia and bangladesh , lovely folks i might add ) but not in france . 
  i know they exist , i 've seen them in the supermarket and stuff but i do n't know any . 
  * i do n't know anyone who speaks a regional language fluently ( no fluent breton , alsacien etc ), 
  are you telling me estonia is not in the east ? 
  ( not sure about the true meaning of the word but est = east in french ) . 
  right , of course , i misunderstood the meaning of showcase !, 
  we had a case like that here . 
  [ a kid died in 84 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_gr%c3%a9gory_villemin ) , it happened in the summer , news was slow so journalists flocked . 
  that case had it all , jealousy , anonymous letters , no clear culprit . 
  [ the kids funeral was filmed ] ( https://youtu.be/ymwq3zvcz10?t=14m58s ) ( extract of that tv show i mentioned earlier ) . 
  soon , the father 's cousin ( bernard ) was under suspicion . 
  it was a small village , one `` had money '' , was getting successful , the other still worked at the factory so it seemed to fit . 
  then , a girl ( the niece , the mother 's sister daughter ) claims to the police that she saw bernard take the kid in his car etc. 
  police let her go home . 
  so bernard is put under arrest . 
  except that after she talked to the judge , she was allowed to go home where it is suspected she was pressured because the next day she denied everything she had told the police so far . 
  so , by now , there 's really nothing against that bernard dude but the judge keeps him in jails anyway . 
  well , there had been writing analysis that had concluded his handwriting was compatible with that of the anonymous letters but they were invalidated . 
  also , later on , more analysis gave totally different results ... during all that time , the case is making front page of popular magazine like paris match . 
  actually , some journalists are getting real close to the family , they get better pictures that way , and fresher news . 
  also , working one side of the family against the other worked well so they kept doing it ( not all of them did , but enough ) . 
  eventually , bernard was released from jail and went back to his old house and his old job despite the obvious danger . 
  the parents of the kids were getting restless , the mother was becoming a suspect ( poor lady was so dirtied in the newspapers after a while ) . 
  the father eventually took his rifle and killed his cousin . 
  so there goes the chance for real justice . 
  the judge was heavily criticized for the way he handled the case . 
  eventually , the case went to another judge which seemed to think the mother was guilty . 
  so for many years , all efforts focused against her ( especially in the news ) . 
  the case against her was eventually dismissed ( in 93 and after having done some jail time ) . 
  it seemed to be the end of it but a couple of months ago , the case was reopened . 
  the first judge was so triggered by it , he actually committed suicide . 
  the niece who was a teen back then is almost 50 now , she was interrogated again , other members of the family have been arrested . 
  the new hypothesis is some sort of collective plan against the parents . 
  i have n't followed the news about it very closely , it 's too cluttered for now . 
  i 'll check it out when the dust settles ( if it ever does ) . 
  this was the worst in term of media circus i think , still going on . 
  `` often cited as the zenith of trash tv in spain ...  the controversial trial of the two arrested suspects became a prime time showcase , featuring gruesome pictures of the teenagers ' corpses , preceded by standard warnings to the audiences . 
  is that sentence meant to be second degree or was the trial seriously aired at prime time ? 
  that seems surreal o_o, 
  i was also expecting trilly rs but the lady in the video speaks really good french and her rs are almost perfect . 
  ( i , on the other hand , can not trill a r to save my life , it 's pathetic ) . 
  the nasal vowels are her weak points . 
  for example , when she says the word ` important ' ( the final sound in french being ' \u0251\u0303 ' ) i almost hear ` importon ' ( final sound almost sounded like \u0254\u0303 ) . 
  she gets the sounds right most of the time except when it 's at the end of a word , i wonder if there 's a specific reason for that . 
  also , the obligatory occasional mix up between the sounds \u025b and e . then there 's one thing i could n't quite put my finger on . 
  so i went to check and indeed !, 
  the stress seems to be put on the first syllable of a word in czech when in french , the only the end of a syntagma will be accentuated . 
  so it results in funky accentuation sometimes, 
  ` r ' sounds of any kinds have become my nemesis lately but indeed , after listening to videos about the russian ` r ' sound and the \u0159 sound and then listening to the music videos i can spot something lacking in the russian * r * . 
  it would take more practice to spot the differences in the vowels i think . 
  then again , it 's likely i 'll listen to more songs from both bands you linked as they were pretty good . 
  maybe in a few weeks i 'll be able to tell them apart for sure :p i now have to find what a czech speaking french sounds like ... 
  i 'm thinking i 'd like that accent . 
  i have no data files on either hungarian or czech ( no , i 'm not a robot , i swear ) . 
  so , from listening , i take it hungarian is * not * a slavic language ? 
  shows you what i know , i thought both would sound similar . 
  i still could easily mistake czech for russian though . 
  also , nice song . 
  probably not . 
  but that the same thing could be said of any language i have n't studied or been familiarized with one way or another ( like i 've watched enough chinese movies to tell the difference between mandarin and cantonese ) . 
  someone could speak to me in czech , tell me it 's hungarian , i 'd have no way to tell if they 're saying the truth or not . 
  oh i know , i lived in strasbourg for a while , i 'm used to it !, 
  my particular disaster area is slowly being weirdly gentrified , it 's bizarre . 
  people working in luxembourg coming to my hometown because it 's close , there 's been lots of new construction , even a golf ffs . 
  it 's ... weird . 
  i actually prefer strasbourg to nancy or metz but ... chut !, 
  at least we can agree the vosges kick ass , be they in lorraine or alsace , 
  us poor lorrains can only dream of reaching glorious alsace , look at it from afar , see how purty it is ... more seriously though , disaster area it may be i 'm still fond of it . 
  it 's home you know . 
  i 've always been a fan of british humor . 
  i love shows like the mighty boosh , the mongrels also little britain . 
  i also enjoy old british sitcom ... like i love * keeping up appearances * and more serious things as well ( i 'm thinking of a mini series called apparitions that i enjoyed a lot ) . 
  there 's always been plenty of american shows on french tv though my favorite ones were n't necessarily the more popular in france ( i 'm thinking frasier and the west wing ) . 
  it 's become way easier to watch japanese dramas as well ( my all time favorite being liar game ) . 
  because i 've started studying spanish i 've been looking into tv shows in spanish and besides the obvious telenovelas ( not to be discarded , practice is practice ) i 've been watching s\u00e9 quien eres and will start looking for another spanish tv show once i 've finished that series .
