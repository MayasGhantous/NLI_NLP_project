  but that damn `` you ca n't watch that video in your country '' on rtve.es is starting to seriously annoy me !, 
  this is europe , damn it !, 
  let me watch !!, 
  if you want to talk about greek scientists , you * must * mention archimedes , the dude was a badass . 
  you could expand a little on aristotle if you want . 
  the man was plenty wrong on many , many things ( [ this article ] ( https://forbiddencomma.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/aristotle-wrong-about-everything/ ) compiles a few things with links to the relevant wiki articles ) . 
  the fact that the word mathematics is a greek name does not mean they were the first to do mathematics seriously . 
  i 'm thinking about some very [ ancient tablets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plimpton_322 ) that were found and show the babylonians had knowledge of the pythagorian triples as far as -1800 . 
  [ chinese mathematics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_mathematics ) should n't be discarded as well . 
  perhaps their influence was less in europe but they existed nonetheless . 
  like said in a previous comment , standing on the shoulders of giants , those giants were n't * just * the greek scientists . 
  science is a continuous and collective effort . 
  so , in the title you say `` contributed overall '' and in the main text you say `` contributed overall the foundation '' . 
  i do n't understand these two the same way . 
  greek philosophy did influence a lot once it was [ rediscovered ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recovery_of_aristotle ) so the arab 's role in the greek influence should n't be discarded ( had they not translated so many things , who knows if we would have recovered them ) . 
  yep , it 's a bit less pretty [ in the east ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@49.5194675,5.7854295,3a,89.9y,43.79h,100.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scmcai60nrxmh9eevpi2ohq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  note that i purposely chose a very depressing looking view but that 's a typical street with houses initially built for the many factory workers decades ago . 
  that 's great , thanks . 
  it 'll be a nice change from my daily el pais articulos :p, 
  yeah , they usually play on lines that serve tourist sites ( like the line 6 ) . 
  i never see them on the lines i use for my daily commute ( it 's one of the small things in life you can be thankful for , you know ? 
  contactless payment is fairly common in paris now as well . 
  love it . 
  right , i had a hunch but i mean , you could have been running with a marx t-shirt or something ... hum . 
  did that happen in spain ? 
  or in america ? 
  ( i was going to write us then remembered there are native americans in southern america too ) . 
  what 's the american meaning of the word ? 
  i originally thought it only meant indian but then saw it could also mean communist so now i 'm confused . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xshjf50mm6s&amp; ) is what it 's mostly associated with in france ( at least with me ) ... 
   what 's with the obsession for mandolin-based soundtracks ? 
  haha , i get a similar reaction with the accordion based soundtracks . 
  incidentally , hearing accordion always reminds me of this [ lovely french player ] ( https://img3.telestar.fr/var/telestar/storage/images/media/images/2014/photos/2014-11-03-yvette-horner-a-92-ans-la-star-de-l-accordeon-emue-par-l-hommage-de-sa-ville-diaporama/yvette-horner5/570179-1-fre-fr/yvette-horner_width1024.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know if there are any near where i live . 
  i 'll check though , it 's a good idea . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for the insight . 
  i really had no clue , i thought the whole protestant/catholic thing was limited to northern ireland . 
  til . 
  there is no official rule , only recommendations . 
  there should be though , the weight of the bag of a typical 6th grader is ridiculous as you have to bring all the books for the day everyday ( school lockers were n't a thing in my time , perhaps they 're more frequent now ... 
  i hope ) . 
  the [ official recommendation page ] ( http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid22481/les-bonnes-postures-et-le-poids-du-cartable.html ) just wo n't load ... 
  the issue is often discussed ( about every year when school starts again and news is slow ) but nothing concrete has been done about it ( as far as i know , i may be wrong ) . 
  oh yeah i just did some reading on it , found out one there 's one club more generally supported by the catholics , another by the protestants . 
  had no idea . 
  also did n't expect the catholic/protestant divide to be that big a deal ( to be honest though , there 's not that many protestants in france anymore - except in alsace ), 
  rangers as in the glasgow rangers ? 
  how would one assume someone is protestant rather than catholic ? 
  this is so brilliantly spot on . 
  i 'm passed the plastic bag of plastic bags and have moved on to a full carton of plastic bags , it 's really getting out of hands ; i need help . 
  victim as in physically / mentally hurt or just on the opposite side of bigotry ? 
  if you meant the first then no . 
  otherwise ... well , i was baptized and made to go to catechism class ( you 'd call it sunday school i guess ) * and * was an altar child . 
  ( the word * bigoterie * in french tends to have a religious connotation ), 
  i do n't know about my fellow countrymen but mine is a little like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwalxfivx1s ), 
  there 's this belgian town very near my hometown ( like 10 minutes ) and when one says * we 're going there * it means * we 're having delicious fricadelle and fries for dinner * . 
  i disagree with him mostly . 
  i also disagree with those who want to keep him from speaking whenever he 's invited to speak somewhere . 
  was n't near paris 10 years ago and it was difficult for me then . 
  still is in my hometown actually ( ... make than impossible ) . 
  the last movie i saw in french was django unchained ... could n't believe it but the screening in vostfr was full before the dubbed one ( had to see the dubbed version because my friends did n't want to come back another day ) . 
  it 's probably easier to watch films in vo now than 10 years ago but they still show a lot of dubbed movies at the ugc la d\u00e9fense for exemple . 
   tros d'ase so i took a wild guess before googling ... google suggestions were weird though : * trop d'amour tue l'amour * ( too much love kills love ) ; * trop d'amour pour mon fils * ( too much love for my son ) and * amour pour son fils citation * ( love for one 's son quotes ) . 
  i was n't too far off . 
  google translate eventually suggested `` piece of ass '' ... 
  i had thought * tros * might mean hole ( it looks like the french noun * trou * ) . 
  that 's a shame . 
  oh well , maybe i 'll get lucky with youtube suggestions !, 
  oh i 'm sorry , i got confused , it was probably in a dragon age 2 dlc and it was the ham that tasted of despair !, 
  ( mark of the assassin that takes place in an orlesian estate ) . 
  the quebec accent is too different from standard french . 
  they accentuate words weirdly , we 'd recognize it right away as being canadian ( we make fun of it often ) . 
  i guess you would n't expect someone with that level of fluency to pronounce the `` r '' that way unless it 's on purpose ( which maybe was the point after all ) . 
  that would be my guess too but i ca n't say for sure . 
  i was n't able to find who 's the voice actor for mother giselle . 
  i found a couple ( as in 2 ) voice actors that are french ( both males ) listed in the additional voices and that 's it . 
  oh well , i disliked the accent but i loved what they did with the cheese ( i mean , cheese that taste of despair ? 
  brilliant ! ), 
  if you like history channels you may like [ confessions d'histoire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uczj9-zfpj74vyv1rzzawtvg ) if you do n't know them already . 
  finding the combo vostfr + non 3d + right time can sometimes be tricky xd, 
  on top of being good , the 98 team was very likable . 
  i did n't get that same ( or similar ) vibe from the current team , but maybe i 'm just getting old ; also , i 've stopped following clubs championships so i do n't know the players very well . 
  i 've been listening to mother giselle , trying to pinpoint exactly what bothered me with her accent . 
  i think it 's the `` r '' . 
  half the time i was like `` oh come on !, 
  even my `` r '' are n't that guttural '' ( and i come from a place where they 're usually more * harshly * pronounced that standard french ) . 
  i found the orlesian accent very annoying but i loved the one from antiva ( loved josephine and zevran \\ ^ \\ ^ ), 
  god , that looks delicious and feasible at home . 
  i ca n't tell you how triggered i am when during mirabelles seasons i go to the supermarket and find mirabelles that are not from lorraine !!, 
  ( the mirabelle is a type of plum which is only good if it comes from lorraine !, 
  or eventually alsace ... but no farther ) . 
  ^ yes , ^ this ^ absolutely ^ is ^ regional ^ chauvinism . 
  ^ j'assume . 
  like any pie , it is n't something you buy though . 
  you go to your gramma 's during mirabelle season ( mid-august to mid-septembre ) , she feeds you tons of mirabelles ( they tend to be a tad expensive ) and eventually she bakes a pie and that 's happiness right there . 
  that 's the one i started watching too , thanks for posting it !, 
   [ this french tv program ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/faites_entrer_l%27accus%c3%a9 ) ( more than 200 episodes ) talks about criminal cases in a very non dramatic , serious manner ( usually ) . 
  is there a spanish equivalent to that show ? 
  thanks for taking the time to compile that list of facts , it actually helped !,
