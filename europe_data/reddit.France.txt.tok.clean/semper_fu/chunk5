   even though when in class we say p in k [ x ] ( with k = c or k = r ) , we never really properly introduced complex polynomials and i actually thought that pairs of complex conjugate numbers would also be roots of complex polynomials as well . 
  but then it makes sense . 
  i remember drawing some figures where it seemed like the roots could n't possibly be conjugate but had decided it was probably due to my poor drawing skills ( they 're abysmal ) . 
  i became aware of the last two points very recently when looking for more data on that problem . 
  i am patiently waiting for my algebra professor to check his emails ( he too is on vacation so , i 'm not holding my breath :p ), 
  i actually went back to college recently and am studying mathematics now ( starting the 2nd year in september ) . 
  i 've been reading on galois theory which seems like it could eventually answer my questions ... but really , why the roots of x ^ 4 -1 form a square and that of x ^ 4 - x ^ 2 + 1 a rectangle is really bugging me . 
  more specifically trying to find if there is a way to link changes to the coefficients of a polynomial to whatever geometric transformation will occur ... anyway !, 
  i hate vacations , i need my professors !, 
  t __ t, 
  i remember having a long and fascinating conversation with a german friend about these translations during which i eventually questioned the pertinence of the french name of mcduck ( picsou ) before eventually finding a way to make peace with it . 
  unrelated : so glad i decided to check out what your username meant , i 've been obsessed with geometry these past weeks and found some interesting things while looking for the theorema egregium , 
  i remember the 98 world cup pretty well . 
  i even surprised myself being glad we 'd won !, 
  ( context : i hate french sport commentators , they 're way too chauvinistic for my taste and as a result tend to not be disappointed when france loses , at least the commentators leave us in peace . 
  actually , back home we used to watch sports events on belgian channels . 
  i hate not being able to do that anymore . ), 
  thanks for that detailed list !, 
  i was waiting for a spanish contribution . 
  now i 'll be able to look for documentaries and work on my spanish a little ( here 's hoping for auto generated subtitles !, 
  ah , that makes sense . 
  that sentence ' * in 1985 , a campaign to pardon and release unterweger from prison began * ' was a little confusing because of the word pardon . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  it 's still recent ( compared to other flavors ) . 
  i did because i had liked the actor in the guard so much . 
  it was a great movie ( if a little depressing ) . 
  i must confess i may have secretly enjoyed one episode of derrick or two as a kid . 
  trying to find more info on the second girl eventually led me to a thesis on photography and painting ( of which i understood nothing ) ... that was weird \\ ^ \\ ^ '', 
  so that 's where the expression comes from . 
  ca n't believe i never looked it up before . 
  til !, 
  there was case where a gendarme was the culprit . 
  some people investigating had started to believe he was either a cop or a gendarme due to the very specific way of phrasing things in the letters he 'd send to gloat about his acts ( assaults , thefts ) . 
  neither the police nor the gendarmerie wanted to believe the culprit was in their own ranks so proper verification of alibis came very late . 
  the guy , alain lamare , was declared criminally irresponsible ( because he was insane ) and was , therefore , never judged though he killed one person and assaulted / hurt many more ( especially two colleges by booby trapping a car ) . 
  the fact that that acronym even exists is pretty awesome . 
  quite the weird case . 
  fits well with the image given by the movie [ the guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_guard_ ( 2011_film ) xd . 
  loved that film , btw, 
  i 've always loved opera in german ( better than in french actually ) . 
  i had never heard of blood libel before . 
  i see from the caricature in the article that a parallel was made with the dreyfus affair . 
  this reminds me more of [ l'affaire calas ] ( https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/the-calas-affair/ ) which was publicized by voltaire 's defense of the accused : a protestant accused of the murder of his son . 
  calas was sentenced to death in 1762 . 
  he was tortured , put on [ the breaking wheel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breaking_wheel ) , strangled then burned . 
  voltaire 's involvement started after calas ' death . 
  calas was posthumously rehabilitated though . 
  whenever minors are judged in france , the trials usually take place '' * \u00e0 huis clos * '' ( like sartre 's play , meaning to public , no press ) if someone involved in the case who was a minor when the facts took place asks it ... which is often the case . 
  that 's all i meant . 
  damnit but that second article was hard to read . 
  i 'm surprised at how this was handled though , especially the fact that they were judged in public . 
  nasty case . 
  a few cases in france have made people question the ever infallibility of confessions . 
  most famous one is the arrest of [ patrick dils ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrick_dils ) for the murder of two boys in montigny-l\u00e8s-metz . 
  he was 16 at the time of the murder . 
  he came under suspicion and eventually confessed to the murder . 
  he was convicted a first time ( the jury did n't even take his minority into account and sentenced him to life in prison ) . 
  he appealed , was convicted again . 
  what made the tides turn for him was the fact that a very famous serial killer , [ francis heaulme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_heaulme ) had semi confessed to the murders to a cop . 
  that man would usually describe being witness to the murders he committed and described the montigny-l\u00e8s-metz murder in great details ... except that he never said where that scene had taken place . 
  so it took the cops in charge a long time ( and some chance ) to figure out he may be the one who killed the two boys . 
  it turns out heaulme was in that particular town when the boys were murdered . 
  that plus his semi confession were enough to cast doubt on dils ' guilt . 
  although heaulme never actually confessed to the murders . 
  the cop who knows him best suspect it 's because heaulme fears his sister would stop visiting him if he confessed to another child murder ( because she had done so in the past ) . 
  heaulme was tried for that murder but not convicted due to lack of evidence . 
  dils was retried and declared innocent after 15 years in prison . 
  i 'm keeping the stig bergling page for later , i love a good spy story . 
  could n't remember where i 'd heard the name kurten before ... 
  the band whitehouse made an album called [ dedicated to peter k\u00fcrten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dedicated_to_peter_k%c3%bcrten ) . 
  that genre of music is as far as you can get from easy listening ... [ that particular track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83hazu5rn98 ) named after k\u00fcrten is very headache inducing for example ( the newman song you linked though is pretty nice ) . 
  had never read about that dude in detail though ... damn . 
  thanks !, 
  the automated translation is a bit hard to follow but it gives good insight nonetheless . 
  could n't help but think of [ that south park episode ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_hat ) ( in which , based on a misunderstanding , people start calling for the release of a toddler murderer ) when i read about that unterweger guy . 
  it 's unusual to see such activism for the release of someone who was found guilty . 
  there are a few instances here where intellectuals took side for a guy but usually , the cases were at least ambiguous , the evidence sketchy . 
  in other words , it was a battle for their innocence , not their release . 
  it 'd be difficult to find public support for the rehabilitation of criminals here as recidivism has been used countless times as a way to score easy political points ( most notably by sarkozy when he was minister of the interior , but not only ) . 
  holy shit , that first story !, 
  i 'm really bummed i ca n't find more sources on that crisis as the wiki article is quite short ( but then , the one in estonian looks even shorter , what gives ? 
  is estonian that concise a language ? 
  i remember watching a documentary on the cannibal of rothenburg and feeling very nauseous indeed . 
  i do n't remember hearing about those nsu killings , i probably was n't paying close attention to the news at that time . 
  i see a movie was made about that story this year . 
  have you seen it ? 
  is it worth watching ? 
  i remember coming across this case when investigating why on earth the germans would name scrooge mcduck after a 7th century french king xd, 
  i remember that case well . 
  it created a big scare in my region ( which borders belgium ) , it was everywhere in the news . 
  [ michel fourniret ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_fourniret ) is sometimes referred to as a french dutroux or as the le monstre des ardennes . 
  his wife ( monique olivier ) would help him kidnap girls ( women are n't as scary as men so they 'd easily get in the car ) which he would keep hidden , abuse and eventually kill . 
  he 's also famous because during one of his stay in prison , he gained the trust of a famous bandit who told him where his band ( [ le gang des postiches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gang_des_postiches ) ) had hidden a very big sum of money . 
  he killed the bandit 's wife and stole their treasure . 
  damn , a real life slasher movie . 
  i was n't surprised to see a movie had been made about it . 
  how was the movie received in finland ? 
  ca n't believe i forgot to mention jack the ripper . 
  last theory i heard about was some german sailor committing the murders in london and then migrating to new-york or something . 
  not sure how serious that theory is , i did n't find the evidences really compelling .
