  the second case you mention reminded me of the french case [ les disparus de mourmelon / pierre chanal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_chanal ) . 
  for years young men doing their military service in mourmelon ( and a few others ) disappeared during their leave in the 80 's . 
  the military just considered them deserters and never investigated any of the disappearances . 
  some families eventually got together , trying to get answers but the police failed to find the culprit . 
  that 's until one day , totally by chance , two gendarmes find a weird looking van and go investigate . 
  pierre chanal almost managed to shake them off but one of the gendarmes saw movement in the van where they eventually found a young hungarian hitch hiker bound in chains pleading them to help him . 
  chanal never admitted to the murders and eventually killed himself before being judged in 2003, 
  politicians ' deaths are always shrouded in mystery . 
  [ robert boulin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_boulin ) in 1979 supposedly drowned himself in 60cm of water after taking too much valium . 
  said valium was n't found in his stomach but in his blood ( hinting to someone could have injected him the drug ) . 
  no analysis was made to see if there was water in his lung . 
  when the family asked for that analysis to be done on some samples that had been taken then buried , the request was denied due to some monument having been erected on top of where the samples were buried ... other samples just disappeared . 
  it 's a weird case . 
  i follow karadoc 's teachings : [ le gras , c'est la vie !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2qbdqxn3iu ), 
  i 've grown to hate that song with every fiber of my being though . 
  heard it too many times . 
  i spent so many hours on cod2 's multiplayer back in the days !, 
  i miss it . 
  back then , the old dudes were still clinging to medal of honor !, 
  the general ambiance on french servers was really laid back , relaxed and overall very enjoyable . 
  hahahahahaha ... * la commune de condom est situ\u00e9e sur la ba\u00efse * ( the river that flows in the town of condom is named la ba\u00efse ... or the fuck and one of it 's principal affluent is la petite ba\u00efse ( the little fuck ) ... that 's perfect, 
  the moselle department has a couple of nice ones : [ bitche ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitche ) no obvious silly meaning in french , just ... bitch ... [ boucheporn ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/boucheporn ) , bouche meaning mouth . 
  heard it 's a very friendly village . 
  supposedly , the final ` q ' is pronounced ... but nobody pronounces it , because when you do n't it gives ` moncu ... mon cul ... my ass ' . 
  [ famous sketch of a humorist visiting said town ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fvadsy7fai ) . 
  sketch starts with `` today , for the first time , i 'm happy to show you my ass ... ( moncuq ) '' . 
  there are probably many more , those are the ones i remember . 
  i would n't mind but i do n't see that happening in the near future . 
  whenever there is the slightest change in the official spelling of a word it never fails to create an uproar . 
  changing the numbers would likely provoke a revolution . 
  yes . 
  the border region of france , belgium and luxembourg actually , 
  the word that came to mind is n't even in the french dictionary ( i just checked on larousse.fr ) , it 's a word that is vastly used in my home region though , especially by kids . 
  one is * nareux/nareuse * when one dislikes drinking from a bottle someone has already taken a drink from . 
  so , first thing you ask when asking to drink from someone 's bottle in my region is `` t ` es nareux/nareuse ? '', 
  then you proceed to asking if you can have a drink . 
  essential information when as a kid in camp your canteen bottle is empty . 
  that 's one sure way of knowing someone comes from my region . 
  that and they may pronounce the number 20 ( vingt ) as vinte instead of vin . 
  some groups that are considered religious in the u.s are classified as cults ( sectes ) in france , that 's the case for scientology . 
  jehovah 's witnesses are n't classified as a sect but are closely watched by the government agency that deals with cult deviance . 
  you can also find some pentecostalism churches ( i 'm mentioning them because their modern form seems to date back to the early 20th century ) but there are n't many i do n't know if you 'd classify catholics who disagreed with the second vatican council are religious group less than a hundred years old ( though , technically ... ) but they exist . 
  i do n't know much about them though . 
  my sister in law works as an elementary school teacher and told us how at the beginning of the year , they had a whole afternoon devoted to `` the right behavior to have when someone unknown/menacing '' has entered school grounds . 
  they taught the kids to hide under their desk , remain as quiet as possible . 
  sounded very frightening . 
  a friend whose mom is also an elementary school teacher told me of similar drills where she works so it does n't seem to be just one odd school doing something weird but something that 's probably been done everywhere . 
  i ca n't say for sure though . 
   i 'm pretty sure reddit does n't allow the \u00e7 character . 
  yours and mine appear perfectly on my screen though . 
  in your post you ask how we 'd react to someone we did n't expect would speak our language speaking it ? 
  honestly , if they 're in france they 're pretty much expected to so it 's very likely people would n't comment on it . 
  there 'd be no credit for partial answers either . 
  it 's unlikely people would compliment you unless your french is * reaaally * good . 
  i would n't , but maybe that 's just a stereotype i happen to match and most french people are n't as rude as you 'd think ... ^ lol i hang out with a chinese girl in class . 
  i show her no mercy !, 
  all year i spoke to her the french i speak with everyone . 
  at the end of the year , the gap between her french and the other chinese students who remained among themselves was astonishing . 
  i did compliment her then . 
  but no teacher went easy on her because she was foreign . 
  on oral exam she was expected to perform like anyone else . 
  first of all , i have to mention your username . 
  i 'm sure it 's a form of play on word `` sais / \u00e7ais '' ... 
  it still makes me cry a little inside . 
  ^ / s. . . but ^ strill . 
  i 'm curious as to what made you ask the question though . 
  how do you expect people would react ? 
  right ? 
  most people in japan do n't . 
  it 's infuriating . 
  even after you 've specifically told them not to worry about it they never do . 
  they 'll nod as if they understood what you said when in reality , it 's possible they understood nothing at all and are too polite to say it . 
  how * did * you know ? 
  it depends . 
  a tourist making an effort to ask directions in french is nice but if they 're struggling and i speak their language then i 'll switch to their language instead ( or english if they speak it better than french ) . 
  if they 're not struggling i 'll give the best directions i can ( in french ) , hoping i did n't mislead them  & nbsp ; while abroad i met this girl at our student housing , she knew i was french and so came up to talk to me . 
  we talked a bit then i asked her where she was from ... and i meant `` what part of france are you from , dear sweet lady ? '' ... 
  `` wroclaw '' she replied ( that 's in poland , the lady was polish ) . 
  my jaw dropped to the floor , especially after finding out she 'd been in france only once for like a week . 
  she has my never ending respect because french feels like it 'd be such an annoying language to master . 
  and she did , well enough for me to believe she was native . 
  & nbsp ; last semester one of my professor was foreign . 
  he 's got an accent ... there 's ... no mistaking where he comes from . 
  it 's not an accent that makes it difficult to understand though , it 's actually quite cute . 
  anyway , he had some troubles with one word in particular he kept using instead of the correct one . 
  troubling seeing as he 'd sometimes need to use that word multiple times in a lesson . 
  it 'd go `` blah blah ... [ incorrect word ] blah '' and inevitably i 'd speak out '' [ correct word ] '' . 
  he 'd use the right one a couple of times then get confused again . 
  it was actually quite funny . 
  i would also correct his bad spelling on the black board . 
  i did n't speak out to be annoying . 
  i 've been abroad and trying to learn a language , it 's better when people point out your mistakes . 
  some do n't do it for fear of seeming rude but really , it 's better to correct people ... once you 're done giggling . 
  he too gets my never ending respect . 
  i mean teaching in a foreign language has got to be hard . 
  that 's the kommissar guy !, 
  xd that track is vital to any good 80 's music playlist !, 
  there are many songs about paris . 
  these are my two favorites : [ il est cinq heures , paris s ' \u00e9veille ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrd2dxknyua ) [ paris sous les bombes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzyfjpj7-ps ),
