  sure . 
  among other things : bits of history from neighboring countries , tons of trivia , how to effectively swear in spanish ( it 's mostly all about taking a dump on whatever the person holds dear ) . 
  i 'd go as far as saying it 's almost a \\* ~ ~ right ~ ~ of passage for high school students , taking to the streets against whatever school ( or not even school actually ) reform is being prepared , no ? 
  mine was during claude all\u00e8gre 's reform ( il faut d\u00e9graisser le mammouth ! ) . 
  i actually have good memories of it . 
  xd my boyfriend has the worst story . 
  i do n't recall what reform was at play when high schoolers went `` on strike '' that year but his dad was having none of it and drove the car in front of the high school , demanding they let him pass ( my boyfriend in the car , trying to make himself very small but it was a small town and everybody knew his dad ) . 
  part of me feels bad for him , the other just finds that story hilarious . 
  edit : ** talk about cultural freudian slip . 
  i , of course , meant `` rite of passage '' *, 
   estancos they 're called `` bureaux de tabac '' en france . 
  usually , you can buy newspapers , magazines , sometimes stationary in those shops as well . 
  they 're easily recognizable thanks to [ that sign ] ( https://static.actu.fr/uploads/2017/01/carotte-bureau-de-tabac-genay.jpg ) . 
  why did you capitalize universal ? 
  i sort of kind of ... 
  i actually really wish latin would become science 's international language again . 
  i * hate * reading about mathematics in english . 
  twice , each time for a whole afternoon !, 
  the first time i accompanied a friend who was visiting a college not too far from the canadian border ( not far from lake placid ) . 
  we spent the afternoon in a canadian border town ( i forgot the name ) . 
  i do n't know how they managed but most locals could tell i was french instantly . 
  the second time i was visiting a friend in buffalo so we made the obligatory niagara falls trip and went on the canadian side as well . 
  i forgot which side has the coolest view . 
  i 'd really like to go for more than one afternoon though . 
  especially the coastal regions . 
  got me there . 
  point being it frustrates her a lot to have to prove her germanness on such a regular basis :p, 
  german for 7 years ( starting at the beginning of junior high ) english for 5 years and a couple of years of latin . 
  in france ( in my time anyway , pretty sure it has n't changed ) when you enter junior high school ( coll\u00e8ge ) you have to chose a mandatory foreign language which will from then on be referred to as your `` premi\u00e8re langue '' ( first language ) . 
  the vast majority of people chose english as their first language however , where i come from being close to luxembourg and germany , it 's also not uncommon to have german as your first language ( which was my case ) . 
  two years later if you 're still in the general section you have to chose a second language ( or deuxi\u00e8me langue ) . 
  the choice varies a lot according to the region people come from , it 's amusing . 
  for instance , in my high school , very few people had taken spanish . 
  the reason being that almost no local coll\u00e8ges ( junior high school ) offered spanish class . 
  in my coll\u00e8ge you could chose between english , german and italian . 
  in most coll\u00e8ges you can find spanish though ... just not so much where i 'm from xd small town , eastern border , who gives a crap about spanish ... right ? 
  but then you 'll ask why italian and not spanish ? 
  good question . 
  well , lots and lots of italian immigrants came to my hometown making italy kind of our honorary culture if you will . 
  as for the quality of the teacher , my german teachers were generally good . 
  depressing sometimes but good . 
  the english teachers ... well , the quality varied more . 
  generally very little emphasis being made on being able to speak ( which is a problem when the final exam is an oral exam as is the case for the second language ) . 
  now that 's intriguing . 
  [ the french wiki article ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/barretina ) shows a photo with the caption `` groupe de rock catalan '' without giving the name of said group ( i 'm curious now ) . 
  also , mind blown , the smurfs wear catalan hats !, 
  now why would you wear a sock on your head ? 
  that makes no sense !, 
  ^ / s i 'll go google what that is this instant ... , 
  true dat . 
  a friend from bavaria keeps being asked where she 's from ( assuming not germany ) because she 's really tiny and has brownish hair . 
  she 's got to have the most german surname possible too . 
  she always makes a note of it , she finds it very annoying . 
  we had no choice but to take it when we subscribed . 
  we could send it back if we could find the damn thing . 
  it 's lost somewhere either in the basement or the black hole that is the hallway closet  _ < i really should look for it though . 
  it pisses me off to pay nagui 's salary very much ( or that of the cast of plus belle la life , or laurent ruquier ... well , you catch my drift ) . 
  if only i could be assured my money was only used for the radio ... or arte ... ( edit : yes , i realize nagui is on france inter ... or was , i lost track :p ), 
  actually now you do n't even have to own a tv to be eligible to pay that tax . 
  just having the tv box thing from your isp is enough to be eligible for the tax , with or without a tv . 
  got a letter from les imp\u00f4ts not too long ago telling me `` well hello there , we get it , you do n't have a tv but we went and check your internet subscription and your isp told us you got the tv box so ... hand over the tax monay please '' ( never even asked for the damned box in the first place . ), 
  tell me your secrets !, 
  i did n't even know what catalonia was then , so no i did n't and i knew valls was spanish , no clue where he was from ( nor did i particularly care to be honest ) . 
  i 've been doing some reading since then though ( on spain in general , not catalonia specifically ) . 
  i 'm a bit less ignorant now than i was then . 
  no , i did n't know them . 
  i 'm in the process of checking it out . 
  sounds interesting . 
  originally was planning to go to barcelona in december for a concert but ca n't clear my schedule ; so ... another time , 
  which literally meant nothing to me until like two months ago when i actually bothered to look up what the ` catalunya ' in [ `` la capella reial de catalunya '' ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_capella_reial_de_catalunya ) was for . 
  why did you assume i was judging them though ? 
  what they did bored me there 's nothing more to it than that . 
  spain . 
  i was 15 and went with a friend and her parents so i was n't in charge of anything and could just tag along . 
  worst vacation of my life . 
  her parents spent their days doing nothing either at the beach or at the pool in that horrible tourist houses neighborhood we were at . 
  i spent my days looking for some shelter from the heat and i remember i was reading firestarter by stephen king that summer . 
  how very appropriate , right ? 
  i 'm not too sure where we were , somewhere around benidorm if i recall correctly . 
  arg , and my friend was obsessed by the fact we could get more boys in spain than in france due to pale skin being rare over there or whatever ... 
  i just wanted to see a museum or a castle ffs . 
  [ jordi savall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jordi_savall ) will never know how much he helped restore spain 's image for me xd, 
  some phrases with incorrect grammar became part of the common language . 
  [ like this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vromqtc7cgg ) which just throws sequence of tenses in the gutter but that pretty much everyone knows ( from the movie [ war of the buttons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_buttons_ ( 1962_film \\ ) ) ) . 
  they can be enjoyable as long as you do n't expect them to be as good as the originals . 
  but the quality keeps going down with each book . 
  that 's why i took a `` break '' from the corrino and am reading something else for the moment . 
  there are some good moments and others that made me facepalm because it felt like i was reading some very dumbed down version of what it could have been had it been written by herbert . 
  i also got the sisterhood of dune a while back ( second hand book shops will be the death of me ) . 
  i 'll read it some day . 
  this winter i particularly liked coming home early , make myself some tea , put on eve online 's soundtrack and read the dune prequels . 
  that was perfection right there  i read dune ( all 5 books ) such a long time ago , it was really nice getting back in that universe ... even if it was n't as awesome as the original books . 
  the ones from god emperor of dune . 
  though i have to say , i 'm almost done reading the prequels ( about half of house corrino ) and duncan 's youth was very enjoyable to read . 
  i like kid duncan a lot too . 
  how about you ?

  for more on nasty french universities , cf [ universit\u00e9s en ruines ] ( https://universiteenruines.tumblr.com/ ), 
  * leto atreides ii ( the dune saga by herbert ) - would make his own party . 
  he would probably take `` les r\u00e9publicains '' over , lure the green party sympathizers with promises of making france a green lush land paradise and win some left wing sympathizers by promising to make spice legal everywhere .
