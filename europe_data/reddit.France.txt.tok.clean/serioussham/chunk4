  however , there 's a very distinct style of [ red bricks and slate roof ] ( http://a142.idata.over-blog.com/3/15/71/03/maison--2-.jpg ) that new buildings must adhere to , or can not deviate much from . 
  that said it 's a local regulation thing , as most of those building codes are . 
  [ is that so ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/nicolas-sarkozy-says-climate-change-not-caused-by-man-cop-21/ ) ? 
  alright , a few clarifications needed . 
  while there 's a massive clash of ideology between father and daughter , saying that the fn is held by the same family simply is n't true . 
  jmlp has been all but ostracized from the party , publicly spoke against his daughter , who ** [ banned him from the party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-marie_le_pen#front_national ) ** . 
  i do n't know much about the youngest 's political stance , but from what i 've seen , she 's adapting her line to whatever the racists in the south-east want to her . 
  -- in terms of ** strategy ** , now , the similarities between trump and the fn are pretty clear . 
  their core base is a strange mix of the ultra-conservative , clearly older crowd , the very religious ( which are pretty rare in france ) , and the post-industrial working class that 's been left to rot since the factories closed down in the 70s . 
  the region where i grew up is now a stronghold of the front national - it used to be a communist bastion . 
  the same dynamics are at play : a disenfranchised , under-connected , poor crowd looking for a scapegoat , and convinced that no politician can help them - therefore looking at `` anti-establishment '' types . 
  another similarity between trump and the fn is that mainstream media and a large part of the population ostracizes them and refuses to engage in actual debate , labeling them as fascists and the like . 
  this , ironically , reinforces the `` us versus them '' mentality and the chasm between the paris elite and the poorer peripheries . 
  -- outside of the far-right , i think trump 's victory is a landmark of populist success . 
  europe and , indeed , france have had their share of it - after all , sarkozy was elected by turning it up to 11 . 
  and he 's back , using the same tricks and the same attitude as trump - he just recently realized he 's a climate change denier , which was pretty rare in france . 
  frenchman living in nl here , i have a very basic level of dutch though . 
  before moving here , i could n't . 
  it was all the same garbled mess to my ears . 
  now , whenever i 'm in flanders , i could almost say that i enjoy hearing it - the most obvious difference being the g , but i also notice some difference in vowels . 
  it 's shaping up to be a bloody mess , even though i do n't see how trump 's victory would change much - besides , perhaps , emboldening the front national . 
  we 're having a left in tatters with the forerunners being the reviled incumbent , a much-hated , heavy handed interior minister , and an isolationist without much mainstream appeal . 
  on the right , there 's grand wizard jupp\u00e9 who 's the literal embodiment of the concept of political establishment , and sarkozy the bogeyman who 's losing his pr war this time , plus a bunch of closet fascists . 
  so the stage is set for people who 're `` sick of it all '' , are tired of the politically correct and so on . 
  most importantly , the same treatment is given to trump 's supporters and le pen 's ; they 're mocked and vilified in the media , and their candidates are rarely engaged on their actual ideas . 
  instead , the candidate and their fanbase are branded as fascists , sexists , and all kinds of epithets which does nothing but generate pageviews and facebook shares , and reinforced the `` us versus them '' mentality that shields those voters from reality . 
  my hope is that this failure to take those people into account and engage their candidate 's ideology will be understood and corrected by european media by the time elections roll in . 
  if they do n't , we 're likely to repeat america 's mistake . 
  things got better , but when i was younger in france , the maestro ( pinpas ) was frequently not accepted , especially in places that dont have a direct connection to the bank . 
  gas stations , trains , that sort of things . 
  and of course , online payments . 
  dutch websites have ideal , but i still have to use a mastercard pretty often . 
  interesting . 
  i actually looked further , and there 's a bunch of exceptions to the rule - teddy himself swore on the bible the second time round , after actually winning the election . 
  still , i believe my original point still stands - perhaps even more so knowing that it 's done willingly , and not to obey some rule . 
  honest question : who was the last president not to do so ? 
   religion is not that pervasive in our national culture . 
  * your president swears on the bible when taking office * . 
  being a declared atheist is political suicide at any semi-serious level . 
  there are schools teaching creationism that are , in some areas , state-funded . 
  even if it 's not always militant religious zeal , there 's a lot of religiosity in the us society - at least , as seen through the eyes of a decently well-informed european . 
  this is probably what i hate most about italy . 
  you ca n't have a fraking dinner , and sometimes even a beer , without some cunt asking you five times if your girlfriend would like a rose or a polaroid picture . 
  is n't the last consonant pronounced as in german `` bach '' ( / x / ) instead of / k / ? 
  i 've taken irish at university but i 've always been confused by that word . 
  never seen it once in my life in europe ( fr/ie/mt / nl/be ) , but i 've heard about it online . 
  it still strikes me as inefficient ( you need an extra container to pour it ) and unpractical to store . 
  the intro is a celtic ( more precisely breton ) melody called [ tri martelod ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tri_martolod ) ( three sailors ) . 
  it 's a pretty popular , traditional celtic tune thanks to [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqeddvus0ku ) , but it 's also been made famous thanks to various covers , including a [ folk metal band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijklhcqw5o ) . 
  the lyrics of that song deal about a young breton warrior from the tribe of [ danu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danu_ ( irish_goddess \\ ) ) , who has to fight the cimmerians and eventually becomes king of his corner of brittany . 
  highly fictional mash-up of mythologies , but fun nonetheless . 
  i 'd advise against it , actually . 
  neither of those can be experienced properly in 2 days , so i 'd suggest smaller cities . 
  they actually have it in [ sardegna ] ( http://www.agugliastra.it/enogastronomia-ogliastra/secondi/item/3697-sa-corda-la-treccia.html ) , where it 's called `` sa corda '' . 
  it 's fucking foul , but my gf ( who 's from there ) loves andouillette . 
  yeah and it can be a pain to find the buckwheat flour . 
  i 'm grateful for those hippie organic food addicts everywhere that allow me to cook galettes all around the world . 
   neger kusjes those can be found in several places , france for starters . 
  ajvar is actually surprisingly easy to find . 
  i discovered it while on holidays in slovenia , and i was able to buy it back home in france , ireland , and the netherlands . 
  cevapi are the shit though . 
   a bottle of bordeaux wine i feel this is a much better answer that it seems , at first glance . 
  it embodies the agricultural past ( and present ) of france , which was/is an important part of the country . 
  it also highlight the respect and care for the land , as well as the skill and knowledge required to transform raw ingredients into an extremely refined product . 
  france has a strong connection to its geography , and is home to top-notch industries . 
  the trade of wine was also a hallmark of french commercial strength throughout the middle ages and the renaissance , so that aspect of history is covered . 
  it being a food item also seems relevant to our epicurean reputation . 
  it 's also something that , for once , is n't tied to paris and reminds people that france exists outside of the `` p\u00e9riph '' . 
  and it being alcohol somehow fits with our propensity for enjoying life and not taking it * too * seriously . 
  haha , well technically i think the barracks are part of the nmi , along with the one on merrion square and some forsaken place in mayo . 
  i really love the archeology one though , the setting is fantastic , the exhibits are plenty and interesting , and it 's free to boot . 
  for modern military history , the [ collins barracks ] ( http://www.museum.ie/decorative-arts-history ) is where it 's at . 
  language : french moon : europe continent : europe, 
  re : food , i 'll echo my fellow frenchman and cast some garlic butter doubt on that claim . 
  that being said , as a resident of the netherlands , i can attest that worse exists . 
  re : welsh , it 's not klingon but it 's certainly more alien than many western european languages . 
  the vowel clusters are one thing , but the existence of consonant clusters that are exceedingly rare ( dd/ll ) and the vso word order makes it plain weird to a lot of people . 
  the border posts were mostly kept , either abandoned or repurposed . 
  i grew up [ next to the fr/be border ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/@50.0288951,4.1455972,3a,75y,142.06h,97.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sy3magjhvgb6pwpjunaud4g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , and the old buildings have been turned into a bar and a fries shack . 
  yum . 
  [ this is what the border looks like ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zr5vt ) . 
  if you mean us as redditors , sure , but as / u/prostynick says , most people wo n't . 
  they might identify florida , california , possibly texas ... but the rest is less commonly known . 
  `` which of those 20 rectangles is iowa again ? '', 
  sadly i never got to do the glasnevin tour . 
  but yeah it could be the perfect follow-up to kilmainham if op 's into recent history . 
  i feel that the same disclaimer you got for amsterdam also applies here . 
  the book of kells is one of the major tourist attractions but unless you 're actually into medieval manuscripts , the history of copist monks or early medieval christian art , i 'd say skip it and avoid the massive queue . 
  if anything , the national museum of archeology is a much better bet . 
  you 'll get early celtic pieces , you 'll get romano-british artifacts , you 'll get viking stuff , christian relics , and all sorts of things for free . 
  it 's also centrally located , right next to the parliament and not far from the beautiful park of st stephen 's green . 
  what do you think , / u/eireannsian ? 
  the guinness storehouse is pretty cool , much better than your average big brewery tour ( and certainly than the heineken experience in a'dam ) . 
  assuming you mean zaventem and not charleroi , yeah its a great airport . 
  there 's plenty of non-beer things to do in brussels or around - depends on what you 're into , and how long you have . 
  declare their unrelentic love in the most original and romantic way possible by attaching a lock on a bridge and engraving/writing down their names on said lock . 
  it 's vandalism , and most importantly , it 's lame and has been done to death . 
  if you want to be romantic and were thinking about that lock thing , i suggest another beautiful gesture straight out of the most romantic play ever , romeo and juliet . 
  sometimes yeah , and not without reason . 
  american politics can have a huge impact on some countries that have strong ties to the us ( uk , ireland ) or that can be affected by us foreign policy ( baltics ) .
