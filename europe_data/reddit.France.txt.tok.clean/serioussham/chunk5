   are they really spoken by all generations though ? 
  no , not by a majority of the population in those regions - that does n't invalidate their status as a dialect though , 
  sorry but that 's really not correct . 
  consider this : what we think of as `` accents '' because words are pronounced differently can be different dialects without a ( well-defined ) spelling . 
  in the nord , they 'll call a dog `` kien '' but will most often write `` chien '' because there 's no standard spelling of picard . 
  besides this , french dialects do exist , although few people speak them . 
  for better or for worse , [ ethnologue ] ( https://www.ethnologue.com/language/fra/19 ) is often quoted as the reference for classification and lists the following dialects of french ( many being extinct ) :  standard french , norman ( normand ) , angevin , berrichon , bourbonnais , bourguignon , franc-comtois , gallo , poitevin , lorraine , saintongeais out of those , normand is probably the most solid candidate for the flagship dialect of northern french , since no one is gon na deny its existence . 
  they even classify [ picard ] ( https://www.ethnologue.com/language/pcd/19 ) ( aka chti ) as a different language , due to the strong flemish influence on vocabulary and pronunciation . 
  i 'd personally disagree and make a distinction between real picard , which is spoken only in picardie ( duh ) and in the very south of the nord , and what 's often referred to as `` chti '' , or just `` northern accent '' . 
  picard is pretty rare , and i 'm not sure many people still qualify as natives . 
  it 's quite different from french and most people would have trouble understanding it , just like real walloon ( and not wallonia french ) . 
  `` chti '' is however the native dialect of most people living in that region , and comes with significant phonetic changes . 
  most regular vowels are much more closed than standard french , while nasals are more open and accentuated . 
  initial / \u0283 / becomes / k / , `` pas '' becomes `` nin '' , and so on . 
  this dialect is reasonably intelligible by most native french speakers . 
  meridional french is another clear dialect . 
  there are very few ( if any ) grammatical/syntax changes , but massive pronunciation changes and tons of lexical leftovers from occitan . 
  besides that , i 'd argue that `` banlieue french '' ( making copious use of [ verlan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verlan ) ) would also qualify as an emergent dialect , of which many people are native . 
  edit : also since the question refers to the language and not the country , let 's not forget the various dialects of french outside of france ( belgian , qu\u00e9becois , ivorian , moroccan and so on ) , or even the dialects spoken in french overseas territories !, 
  yeah in hotels it 's understanding , if annoying . 
  but i know couples who do that at home . 
  that 's not a thing everywhere . 
  the dutch are very fond of it , but i 've never seen it in france ( as it goes against our deepest convictions ) . 
  people tend to be unhappy about it , and certain groups that are doing it more often than others do get some flak on a regular basis - railway workers being the prime target . 
  that said , there 's a strong sense that those strikes are what gave france its labour laws and that in the long run , they 're beneficial to get better working conditions ( or keep capitalism in check ) . 
  if anything , i 'd say a'dam is underrated , as it has much more to offer than what it 's known for . 
  star trek was never broadcast in french tv , afaik . 
  because of that , it has very little following , unlike germany where it 's practically a cultural cornerstone . 
  source : work with star trek licensed products . 
  lille is great . 
  it has a vibrant cultural life , lots of younger people , a nice `` local flavour '' , cool architecture , and very friendly locals . 
  you 're also super well connected - paris is 1h away , london , bruxelles and amsterdam are n't far either . 
  i have n't been there in forever but you 'll surely get more info on / r/france ( you can post in english ) . 
  i 'm from the area and as much as it pains me to agree with / u/goeie-ouwe-henk , he 's right . 
  lille is a fantastic city , but the nord in general is pretty crap . 
  you 'll find some nice green areas if you 're into forest trekking or whatever , but it 's mostly poor/unemployed/isolated . 
  it 's even worse in the other `` cities '' , like maubeuge or douai . 
  even the suburbs of lille ( roubaix , tourcoing ) are shit , and potentially dangerous . 
  bad food because english staples and `` typical '' dishes are often perceived as uninspired , insipid or tasteless . 
  i 'd like to point out , however , that the netherlands is worse . 
  you mean for the `` crusader state '' label ? 
  as i understand it , they begrudge states that are involved in the current war against is , not necessarily in the previous conflicts . 
  as [ this chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_intervention_against_isil#involvement_by_country ) points out , there 's been direct military intervention by germany , while italy and greece `` only '' provided support . 
  two reasons , mostly . 
  1 / terrorism has little to do with refugee flows , and much more with the existing demography . 
  due to the post-war rebuilding efforts and decolonization happening around the same time , large numbers of people moved from the maghreb and other french ( ex ) colonies to france . 
  this evolved , two generations down , into ghettos of predominantly muslim , predominantly poor people who are n't well integrated within french society - although they 're french themselves . 
  they 're angry and disenfranchised , and jihad is the perfect cause for them to espouse . 
  2 / france , germany and the uk are seen as being `` crusader states '' because of their perceived greater involvement in anti-is military operations . 
  italy and greece do n't fall under that category , at least so far . 
  however , we 've seen that it 's a flexible justification because belgium is n't playing a very large role in the coalition , but has been attacked and branded `` crusader '' all the same . 
  champ is a field ( both literally and figuratively , i.e potato field and lexical field ) . 
  camp is a camp , as in `` encampment '' . 
  it 's also used as `` side '' as in `` taking sides '' - you choose the encampment of the army you support , so to speak . 
  and i 've been taught that if you 're an insufferable pedant , you can keep it going by adding saints , i.e dia , muire agus padraig duit . 
  ( may god , mary * and * st patrick be with you ), 
  that big hypocritical smile . 
  if you 're based in the uk , farsons delivers it via amazon ( as well as cisk ) . 
  you 'll have better luck in / r/irishhistory . 
  my understanding , however , is that cira and rira got at least part of their funding through racket and drug-related operations both in the north and in the republic . 
  weapons , if i 'm not mistaken , were sourced from eastern/central europe . 
  it 's a german thing , they consider it cleaner and less messy . 
   republicans is also a political party in france they do n't have ( much ) in common with the gop though , it 's really a name change without much ideological variation compared to its previous incarnation ( the ump ) . 
  there * is * a certain americanization of a part of the french right-wing establishment , but it 's still a far cry from the shitshow that was put on display during the primary . 
  eh , i think it 's not even that bad - it 's certainly a boon for tourism . 
  the only major downside i see in my daily life is the amount of high people clogging up the bike lanes , but i agree it 's an excellent system . 
  i 'm confused - you 're talking about weed , right ? 
  it 's totally legal to buy weed at the coffee shop and go home with it . 
  what 's not ( technically ) allowed is to smoke it in the streets , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  but yeah , anyone who 's lived in the center of amsterdam can tell you that most of the debauchery comes from drunken brits on a stag party who ca n't handle the sight of women in lingerie and/or fall off in the canals while taking a leak . 
  and i 'll also point out that both drugs and prostitution exist everywhere since the dawn of time , and that the amount of high tourists in amsterdam is certainly lower the number of meth addicts in missouri . 
   amsterdam for the sin city ... have you ever been to amsterdam ? 
  yeah , there are n't any 2 floors , semi-detached houses anywhere near the center of a'dam . 
  amsterdammer here . 
  the city center looks pretty much [ like the postcards ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/13999572.jpg ) , while the more residential parts of town [ adopt a modernized version ] ( http://cloud.funda.nl/valentina_media/066/228/038_2160x1440.jpg ) of the same style . 
  sometimes , the dutch love for copy/paste [ goes a bit too far ] ( http://hollandroute.media.jimbo-platform.nl/dmedia/media/user-images/38203/bad5d/8f283/39cbe/42693/amsterdam%20hoofdweg.jpg ) . 
  for that price , you 'll get a 50m \u00b2 flat in a decent part of amsterdam . 
  i miss them in the numismatic sense , especially the notes that had cool people on them . 
  the last note to be introduced featured [ painter paul c\u00e9zanne ] ( http://www.joksankolikot.net/setelit/ranska/100-francs-1997-etu.jpg ) , and the highest commonly-used banknote when the euro arrived honoured [ pierre & marie curie ] ( http://maisonplatt.com/upload/photos/296a.jpg ) . 
  i also enjoy ( ed ) visiting other countries and reflecting about what the choice of illustration on banknotes tells about that country . 
  that being said , i freaking love the euro and the amazing convenience it brings , especially since i was born along a border and had to keep stashes of two currencies to buy my candy . 
   or maybe i 'm getting old and nostalgic ... 
  i think you are , because all i could think was `` damn those look like the ugly 80s '' :d, 
   unlike every other country that switched . 
  maltese money was also worth more ( 1 lira = 2 euros something ), 
  there * used * to be , though , especially in the north-east . 
  tons of poles were `` imported '' as labour for the coal mines in the first 3 decades of the 20th century , and you 'd often have polish districts in the mining towns of the north . 
  i have n't experienced it first hand , obviously , but my grandparents told me about widespread racism at school and a strong community pressure - both from the french to keep the poles out , and from the poles to intermarry and generally keep to themselves . 
  clashes were frequent , as were beatings . 
  monster.ie , linkedin as well . 
  it 's been a while since i was there and i was focusing on specialized sites for my industry , but i 'm sure some googling around will help . 
  also / r/dublin . 
  expat living in amsterdam here . 
  unsurprisingly , linkedin is the most useful single site here . 
  job postings are up there and , most importantly , recruiting agencies are active there . 
  the thing , however , is that in my experience dutch ( or nl-based ) companies are very reluctant to hire someone who 's not already in amsterdam , unless you have a very specific skillset ( for instance , a regional manager for romania might be recruited directly from romania ) . 
  amsterdam is a great place to live , frankly . 
  rents are insanely high and the weather is shit , but that 's all the negative - everything else is enjoyable . 
  you can totally function in english , although you 'll be more or less forced to pick up some dutch along the way for administrative purposes , and other daily life aspects . 
  it 's not overly hard to learn , although pretty ugly and useless outside of nl .
