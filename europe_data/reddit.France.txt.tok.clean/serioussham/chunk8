  france - i ca n't really comment on radio/tv , but in print they 're prety much always referred to as '' \u00c9tat islamique '' ( abbreviated ei ) , the direct translation of islamic state . 
  the french government suggested , early on , [ that they be called daesh ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20140917-france-switches-arabic-daesh-acronym-islamic-state ) , and some media followed suit for a while , but it 's not really used anymore , except when quoting arabic speakers . 
  no , the fees apply to payments in another currency . 
  ah , yes , my terminology could i have been better !, 
  i suppose anything outside of the major towns would qualify as countryside , although i 'll admit that it 's a bit subjective . 
  [ on this map , for instance ] ( https://www.google.nl/maps/place/montpellier,+france/@43.6744491,4.046091,10z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x12b6af0725dd9db1:0xad8756742894e802?hl=en ) , you can see b\u00e9ziers , montpellier and nimes - those are towns , and the rest is pretty much countryside , as in small villages with a mostly agricultural landscape . 
  if you move into the green area on the map , you 'll get the savage , uncultivated nature that 's certainly worth seeing . 
  the thing is , public transport in those somewhat remote areas is going to be terrible . 
  like , twice a day to no service at all terrible . 
  so it really depends of what you 'll have access to , what style of stay you 're looking for , and what you want to see . 
   how important is it to book this ahead of time ? 
  assuming you 're doing there this summer , i 'd say `` quite '' . 
  i honestly do n't have much experience about booking hostels in that region , but consider that summer is the height of the tourist season in a very touristy region . 
  if you 're planning to get a hostel in the cities ( as opposed to the countryside , or to campsites ) , i 'd highly recommend booking in advance . 
  if you 're less concerned about being in the center of things ( and/or are going around in a car ) , i 'd suggest looking at the [ gites ruraux ] ( http://www.gites-de-france.com/ ) . 
  they 're a mixture of b&b and inn , and they usually consist of a vast farmhouse or similarly old building divided into several rooms , and are run by the owners who live there . 
  it 's a pretty cool way to experience the region since the hosts are often locals who are eager to point you towards the best local attractions or secret spots . 
  bonus points : a fair few of them are run by expats who decided to settle in france , and therefore would speak english . 
   many , perhaps even most of the people you encounter will speak english , particularly in cities , tourist areas and in hotels and train stations i mostly agree with your post , but i do n't think this is very accurate . 
  i know for a fact that most people in france and italy will struggle to speak english , and i 'm pretty sure that spain is in the same boat . 
  obviously , you 'll have a higher chance of success with the staff in hotels , tourist attractions , and other popular hotspots , but one should not expect to get by just in english . 
  / u/biostrike : i could n't find a centralized french portal for deaf-friendly tourism , but you can easily search for that sort of information on the cities ' or regions ' websites . 
  look out for the words `` handicap '' or `` accessibilit\u00e9 '' . 
  and since you said you can read french , here 's the [ french railway guide ] ( http://www.voyages-sncf.com/guide/voyageurs-handicapes ) for handicapped travellers . 
  i believe that most tourist attractions and large train stations will provide you with everything you 'd need , and they 'll likely have sign language speakers in the larger stations during office hours . 
  aside from yelp , i suggest tripadvisor and ( for some some cities ) [ spottedbylocals ] ( http://www.spottedbylocals.com/ ) . 
  you 'll get free wifi often enough in france , not so much in italy , but again the city centers will provide more than adequate coverage . 
  and +1 to using the text-to-speech featuee in googletranslate , for big languages like french , italian or spanish , it 's extremely reliable . 
  feel free to pm me if i can be of any assistance with france or italy-related things !, 
  do you have a reasonable level of french ? 
  most universities only offer classes in french , and you generally wo n't have fun if you do n't speak the language . 
  i had some italian friends who had a decent level and went to study some more technical things like medicine or engineering , and had a really rough time . 
  and their mother tongue is much closer to french than yours is . 
  the locals do n't really care if you 're ambling along the canals in the centre while being high . 
  it gets annoying when you 're making a mess or , worse , when you just stand/walk slowly in the middle of the road , obstructing the way for cars or bikes . 
  it 's generally frowned upon to smoke in the street , and some bars/pubs are pretty strict about not allowing joints in their smoking areas for legal reasons . 
  it gets considerably more lax in the city parks , and you can do whatever you want on your own balcony . 
  i 'm in amsterdam , btw . 
  my flag needs some straightening it seems !, 
  smoking joints in the street and standing in the way of my bike . 
  amsterdam checking in - for starters , check / r/amsterdam and , most importantly , our [ awesome wiki ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/amsterdam/wiki/index ) ( you 'll be lynched by the crowd if you ask something without checking it ) on the topic of travel : amsterdam ( and nl in general ) has an awesome public transport service , and you can get to schiphol [ during the night ] ( http://9292.nl/reisadvies/station-amsterdam-centraal/station-schiphol/vertrek/2015-04-22t0317 ) . 
  btw , this site/app is called 9292 and will be your best friend for any itinerary anywhere in the country . 
  it 's hard to give recommendations for food or else without knowing your taste , but in my opinion there are two `` bars '' you should not miss : the [ ij brewery ] ( http://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/splash-page-nl/ ) and the [ wynand focking distillery ] ( http://www.wynand-fockink.nl/en/menu1-en/proeflokaal-en ) or , more precisely , its tasting room . 
  both offer very dutch ( imo ) atmospheres with local products that are typical of the netherlands ( beer and jenever , a sort of gin ) , in a pretty unique location . 
  if you 're in for culture , you have the [ rijksmuseum ] ( https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en ) which has the most impressive collection , includes history as well as art , and is just generally awesome ( and a tiny bit intimidating ) . 
  alternatively , the [ nieuwe kerk ] ( http://www.nieuwekerk.nl/nl/ ) offers the world press photo exhibition , which - as the name implies - showcases the best press photos of the year , sorted by category . 
  it 's not exactly an uplifting sight , but i think it 's certainly worth the while - and it 's dead in the center of amsterdam . 
  on the topic of food : it will probably be the least inspiring destination of all , but i suggest you take some fries from a street vendor after your first joint , and bitterballen as a bar snack somewhere . 
  and if you do go to the ij brewery , take the cheese and sprinkle it with celery salt ( provided ) , it 's quite unique and extremely good , 
  +1 for haarlem . 
  for paris , depending on your timeframe , i 'd actually suggest taking a train somewhere . 
  lille is one hour away , rennes two hours , and normandy is also close by . 
  they 're all pretty amazing and will give you , i think , a more authentic taste of france than paris . 
  that 's probably valid all year round tbh . 
  as much as i hate the southeast , it 's probably the best option to drive around in a lambo , because of the awesome countryside . 
  the southwest might also be nice , landscape-wise , though i 'm not sure how common luxury rentals are . 
   train to paris from amsterdam which again is cheaper if you are lucky and book long in advance . 
  otherwise it 's still a solid 80 $ , which can be more expensive than some airlines . 
  this is correct . 
  i 'd suggest checking on the site of each train operator ( so deutsche bahn for hamburg ) to look for information about their opening times . 
  many stations will not allow it to avoid homeless people sleeping in . 
  on the other hand , i know from personal experience that you wo n't have any issues spending the night in hamburg ... as long as you manage to stay awake ;p, 
  start by reading wikipedia for each of those , and them look up your prospective university 's reputation . 
  how 's your command of those languages ? 
  you 'll miss out quite a lot in paris and madrid without spanish and french . 
  eurolines is almost always the cheapest option , but it 's often too long for weekend trips . 
  besides ezjet and ryanair , do n't forget to check skyscanner as national companies sometimes have very decent deals . 
  it 's indeed quite unlikely that europeans would have extensive knowledge of immigration laws in every eu country . 
  are you sure it was n't home-made ? 
  i ca n't think of any big-name liquor brand that uses a flip top . 
  it could likely be one of the million of varieties of chartreuse made by a local producer . . maybe start [ on this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:herbal_liqueurs ) ? 
  i 'll second / u/a4b here , tbh . 
  there are many coach transfer services to both airports in rome , and i 'm betting that 100 % of them will speak english on account of it being rome . 
  if she 's staying in a hotel , there might even be a pick-up point at the hotel , so it 'll be as good as a taxi . 
  the only thing you have to make sure is which terminal the flight leaves from . 
  besides that , if your mom has ever flown , she 'll be ok . of course you can do whatever you want , but i assume you 're not staying too long in europe and spending an entire day just to go to rome and back is a bit of a shame . 
  i 'll play the devil 's advocate for a bit - i see where they 're coming from . 
  some specific urban developments ( `` cit\u00e9s '' ) in the parisian suburbs ( `` banlieues '' ) have a higher than average amount of poverty and criminality , and they have a very rocky relationship with the police . 
  as a result , some of the inhabitants of those * cit\u00e9s * are very hostile towards any envoy of the state : here 's a [ random article from 2007 ] ( http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2007/10/05/violences-les-pompiers-en-ont-ras-le-casque ) describing how ** firefighters ** were lynched after they arrived to quench a car fire started by the same crowd . 
  as a result , civil servants are somewhat reluctant to go there . 
  as you 'd expect from ghettoes , tourists and `` non street-wise '' people are also advised not to take a stroll through those concrete jungles . 
  and because of the extreme reactions caused by their presence , it 's likely that the police wo n't come if you call them for a petty crime ( `` someone stole your sweetroll ? 
  '' ) , which therefore can go unpunished . 
  that 's why sensationalist media sometimes dub them '' * zones de non-droit * '' , or `` lawless zones '' . 
  -- as you 'll notice , this has fuck all to do with sharia , or muslims , or arabs . 
  i 'm guessing the glorious fox reporter confused those rough areas of suburbian paris with the [ sharia zones ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/29/article-2020382-0d310e3000000578-763_468x289.jpg ) stickers plastered by that retarded brit some time ago . 
   so maybe i 'm more `` patriotic '' by default that 's probably the difference . 
  americans are patriotic , while many european countries frown on overt displays of patriotism . 
  also , from what i 've seen , the unique relationship between lobby groups , the media , and the strongly bi-partisan system that you have over there creates an atmosphere that 's more akin to the superbowl than political debates as you 'd expect them . 
  political campaigns take their cues from the entertainment and advertising business ( like , tv ads for politicians ? 
  wtf ? ), 
  and people support team red or team blue the way they 'd cheer for the sox or the yanks . 
  finally , you 've probably heard about france being on strike all the time . 
  some of it is pure corporatism , but a good number of them happen as a reaction to political decisions/announcements . 
  how is that not caring about politics ? 
   how is this socially different across europe ? 
  well , for starters , it varies vastly from country to country . 
  the netherlands have a much more open approach to political discussion in informal contexts than , say , italy ( i 'm not talking about family dinners here ) . 
  it 's pretty hard to summarize such a major and influential party , but let 's give it a go . . - the fn is a ** populist ** party , meaning that they will say whatever crap resonates well with a lot of people while fanning their hate and fear to induce an emotional response . 
  common targets for fear and hate include government and other `` big '' institutions like banks , and foreigners .
