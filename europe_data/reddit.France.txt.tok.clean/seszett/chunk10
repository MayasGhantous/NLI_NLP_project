  france ? ), 
  too , and so on ? 
  since immigration like most other `` natural '' things usually are n't linearly correlated to whatever criterion you choose but most likely exponentially . 
  of course you can strictly limit immigration from each country to the same percent that represent compared to the eu population ( or the world population ? ), 
  but does that actually make sense ? 
  disproportionate , though ? 
  is n't that like less than 10 % of yearly immigration to the uk ? 
  it sounds like such a small number that i do n't see how it means anything . 
  not really citizens though , but rather inhabitants . 
   hermione is an animal hermine is ( and it 's also a given name ) but the two names are actually unrelated . 
  hermione is a character from greek mythology . 
  pistachio is best , not chocolate !, 
  i understand what you mean , but regarding  in fact , it 's impossible to read `` tsch '' or `` sch '' in turkish . 
  how would you pronounce `` t\u015f '' though , if it was written ? 
  i do n't know turkish at all , but i have a hard time imagining the difference it would make with '' \u00e7 '' . 
  and if it does make a different sound , then either '' \u015f '' is not really the same as `` sch '' , or '' \u00e7 '' is not really the same as `` tsch '' . 
   `` tsch '' is one . 
  because you 're used to writing it with one letter . 
  for french and german speakers i can assure you that `` tsch '' / `` tch '' are very much two sounds . 
   how does tsch or ch make the sound they represent ? 
  it is a different sound well , to me `` tsch '' is just the sound for `` t '' followed by the sound for `` sch '' . 
  in french , where the german `` sch '' equivalent is `` ch '' , the `` tsch '' equivalent is also just `` tch '' . 
  having a single letter for `` sch '' might make sense , but one for `` tsch '' ? 
  that 's completely useless and overkill in my opinion . 
  if turkish `` sh '' makes another sound , then this does n't apply for turkish obviously , which is fine since different languages are different . 
  but reading it again ... it seems from this latest post that you 're actually arguing for having one letter for `` sch '' , not for `` tsch '' ? 
  well , in french the `` ch '' sound actually derives from the `` c '' sound ( like canis -  chien , or marka -  marche ) . 
  if you pronounce a `` h '' sound after a `` k '' , it does resemble `` ch '' kinda and that 's the way `` ch '' appeared in french ( some dialects still pronounce `` ch '' as a hard `` k '' ) . 
  it was the same broad process with the many variations of the `` sh '' , `` ch '' and `` sch '' sounds at least in english , dutch and german . 
  these letters combinations are not as arbitrary as you might think . 
  it 's also not just by chance that `` s '' and `` c '' were chosen as the basis for \u0161 / \u015f and \u010d / \u00e7 both in turkish and croatian . 
  the main difference with turkish is probably that your alphabet was `` intelligently designed '' relatively recently , while ours just mostly evolved `` naturally '' over the last two thousand years . 
  nobody 's going to create a whole new letter or accent just to write some sound we can already write right now . 
  not sure i 'd call that a simplification though ? 
  it 's replacing a set of letters that naturally make some sound with a specific letter just for it ? 
  why not use a single character for ... tr as well ? 
  that 's a very common sound !, 
  what about one for ing , and another one for tion ? 
  what a mess that would be . 
  in france ( and wallonia ) we call the same thing a `` fricadelle '' or `` frica ** n ** delle '' ( with no clear pattern it seems , at least in france ) . 
  it 's funny that in between france , wallonia and the netherlands , flanders call `` frikandel '' something different, 
   i have yet to see far right politicians properly put into their place in debates , even though that 's an incredibly easy thing to do . 
  in france at least , they go to great lengths to avoid debates . 
  there are even instances of marine le pen purposely reading a newspaper during a `` debate '' between her and the left-wing candidate , without saying a word during the whole thing basically . 
  they are basically unable to have a debate against a rational person . 
   how about compared to 1997 france ? 
  the one just after this series of bombings in the paris metro by islamist terrorists ? 
  no thanks . 
  though terrorist attacks have maybe become [ less frequent ] ( http://ssz.fr/attentats/ ) since this era . 
  i 'm pretty sure nobody has ever stopped trying to `` right the ship '' , the problem is nobody knows how to do it . 
  the only thing that seems obvious from the fact that attacks still take place today , is that militarising society , increasing surveillance , and leading wars does n't seem to work that well , though there are so many factors into play that even that might actually be working to some point , with other parallel , uncontrollable factors driving the fluctuations of the constant terrorism threat that has been there since the 70s . 
  leaving is the fallback plan , and he 's supposed to be prepared to it if needed ( edit : and then try build a new , parallel , union , not stay alone at the margin of the eu -- i think the idea at one point was for it to be more centered around the mediterranean , but i guess this option does n't look as good these days ) . 
  his main argument is that france has a lot more weight than greece to bring deep changes to the eu institutions , and that other countries might side with him as well , while greece was kinda alone . 
   anti-eu that 's where the big difference with le pen is though , on the european matter ( because there are a lot of other differences on other topics obviously ) . 
  he 's actually for _ some _ eu , although under different terms because he sees the current ones as giving to much power to lobbyists and multinationals compared to the countries ' citizens . 
  the first step in his program is not to leave the eu , but to renegociate treaties while hoping that the weight of france would be enough to make the rest of the eu yield to his demands . 
  which is not a given , but is a very far cry from what le pen wants . 
  le pen is mostly against the eu because she 's isolationist and does n't want to have to cooperate with other countries . 
   jupp\u00e9 head of the party ? 
  not at all . 
  in fact because of its judgment alain jupp\u00e9 left the party to nicolas sarkosy in 2002 whereas he was the heir of chirac . 
  but , but ... you 're plain wrong . 
  jupp\u00e9 was head of ump from 2002 to 2004 . 
  jupp\u00e9 exiled himself as the mayor of a major city . 
  before running for president . 
  yep , looks like someone who did n't have a career within the party anymore ( hint : you should have picked the moment when he exiled to qu\u00e9bec instead , that was the real `` exile '' from his party ) . 
  you 're going to have a hard time convincing me that any of those guys , condemned or not , are just honest ump politicians , mate . 
  if you actually think they are , you are just burying your head in the sand . 
  the last five years have clearly shown that the ps is not more lenient ( anymore ? ), 
  than the ump regarding its politicians . 
  not sure about ukraine , but i think a reasonable percentage of french people mostly see nato as a us-dominated organisation that gives us obligations but no benefits . 
  is that wrong ? 
  what does france gain from nato ? 
  as i understand it , if you 're isolationist if makes sense not to be part of nato , and if you 're federalist you should also prefer an integrated european force rather than a us-dominated one . 
  then if you 're more some kind of generic liberal , you 're probably willing to be closer to the us . 
  it 's quite funny to be accused of downvoting you once i eventually reach the end of your post . 
  but i did n't say that left-wing parties are clean as snow . 
  actually , i said right-wing parties are * more * guilty of these things , which implies that left-wing parties are also guilty to some point . 
  you do n't have to prove it with a few random names including 20 year old cases , as hand picking your examples would have served you better . 
  i 'm also one of those guys who do n't think that most of the ps is really left-wing anymore , but i do n't really mind , it 's just a way of classifying things , it 's ok . a couple years ago maybe , there was this long-ass list of condemned politicians . 
  i 'm pretty sure the right-wing side of the list was quite a bit longer than the left-wing one , although both were pretty long . 
  was it [ this one ] ( http://lesmoutonsenrages.fr/2013/04/05/liste-non-exhaustive-des-condamnations-et-mises-en-examen-du-ps-de-lump-et-du-fn/ ) ? 
  i remembered it being longer than that . 
   at least , for the right , the guilties do n't stay at the head of the party . 
  the problem is that there is no amnesty for the right . 
  not sure if you 're talking about chirac , president , sarkozy , president and head of the party , fillon , official candidate for the party , cop\u00e9 , head of the party , or jupp\u00e9 , head of the party , here . 
  all these guys have been implied in some corruption or theft cases as you might know . 
  few of them have actually been condemned to hard sentences , which you might either take as `` there are actually amnisties for the right '' or `` they are innocent as a newborn lamb '' , depending on the bias you choose to have . 
  well , maybe not `` all '' . 
  after all , fillon , jupp\u00e9 and chirac , tib\u00e9ri as well , are all from the same party . 
  le pen is from another party . 
  when a left-wing minister had a similar affair a few years ago , cahuzac , he was rather swiftly ousted from his party , judged and condemned to prison , without his party accusing justice of being partial or doing a bad job . 
  so for now , until further proof , i 'd still say that the two right-wing parties are more guilty of these things than the others . 
  not arch-enemies maybe , but france * did * spend the next thousand years slowly conquering was used to be lotharingia . 
   haiti still owes them a 200 year old debt . 
  huh , no . 
  haiti had paid the sum in full by 1883 . 
  they themselves contracted a debt to be able to pay this sum . 
  this debt was paid by 1972 . 
  six of them , those that were destroyed during the battle of verdun .
