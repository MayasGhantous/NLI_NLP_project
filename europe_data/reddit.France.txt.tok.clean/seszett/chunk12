  the `` paper '' that says it is wrong is the fundamental list of our nation 's values , agreed upon time and again , for several centuries , so you can not go against it . 
   i would say it very immoral to make it illegal for women to drive . 
  whatever the consition say or how big of a majority vote for it . 
  if 99.99 % of the people of france vote for it and there 's nothing in the consitution about it ... it 's still wrong . 
  morality exists for religious people , it means nothing for a secular state . 
  instead of a morality , we have fundamental values which we laid out in a few papers . 
  among them , the most important one is acting for the common good , and we 're doing what we can for that . 
  your whataboutism is leading nowhere . 
  free soda refills are n't a fundamental right , banning them is n't immoral , and this whole `` discussion '' is getting absurd by the minute . 
  let 's stop here . 
   fine , the right to drive is n't in the constitution i assume . 
  how about all the men vote for making it illegal for women to drive ? 
  everyone happy ? 
   or how about straight people vote to make acts of homosexuallity illegal again ? 
  everyone happy ? 
  that falls under discrimination ( according to sex or sexual orientation ) . 
   and is the consitution really the only thing that should be there to stop the majority from taking away the right to vote for majorities ? 
  consitutions can change ... see my point ? 
  for a fundamental thing like right to vote , it 's actually not protected by the constitution itself but by the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , which is above the constitution . 
  constitutions also need far more than a simple majority to change , at least ours . 
  i see your point , but you 're not seeing mine . 
   yes , i realize you are fond of making decisions for other adults . 
  i 'm pointing out that it 's immoral . 
  what 's immoral in my opinion , is to tell other people how to run their own countries , especially when they 're doing fine without your input . 
  trust me , we have had a few centuries to think about our forms of government , being at the fifth one only counting republics , we have not had any dictatorship for much longer than most of our neighbours , and are among the most socially liberal countries . 
  so i think we 're fine . 
  but thanks for thinking about our freedoms . 
  the things you ca n't take from people through voting are laid out in the constitution . 
  voting is among those , as are striking , practicing a religion , etc , but for some reason , free soda refills are n't there . 
  and i 'll feel free to take part in the governing of my country however i want according to the base principles of our republic and the current constitution , thanks . 
  can you tell me why seemingly everyone outside france wants to see macron president ? 
  he 's certainly better than fillon , but so are hamon and m\u00e9lenchon , and at least these guys have a _ programme _ already . 
  i voted for a parliament which in turn voted for this law . 
  for one , that 's the kind of policy i actually want them to pursue , so it 's quite good . 
  so i get to decide what laws apply to me and my fellow citizens , and everyone 's happy . 
  except some foreigners on the internet , for some weird reason . 
   gb 's smaller , yes , but not tiny in comparison well , going by [ these numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) ) the eu has a gdp of 17 billion $ and the uk 2.6 billion $ . 
  so about 15 % . 
  maybe my understanding of the word `` tiny '' is n't exact , but in any case that 's rather small . 
  like , `` losing '' the uk does n't even change the eu 's global rank . 
  all economies are tiny in comparison to the us , the eu and china . 
   so that rich people can watch live concerts ? 
  concerts are n't reserved to rich people . 
  you might call that subsidies and oppose them i guess , but here ( in lille , france ) concerts , opera , theatre are quite affordable to anyone , usually under 30 $ and down to 10 $ , 5 $ or less for the young and jobseekers . 
  if going to such events is a rich people 's thing , it 's mostly just because the others think it 's a rich people 's thing . 
  which is a shame , because culture benefits everyone . 
  but the french system is n't first-past-the-pole and does n't favor extremes . 
  it actually disfavors them a lot , since the second turn always gives a reasonable opponent to the extreme one .

  [ hello ] ( https://inconvenantes.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/ronds-points-a-nantes/ ) from the capital of roundabounts in the country of roundabouts . 
  in nantes we have [ square roundabouts ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rc1hrajnc7a/ubg4rhd6kwi/aaaaaaaabck/t-1ix12ivme/s1600/rp_rez%c3%a9.jpg ) , [ double roundabouts ] ( http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/04/1453806288-1.jpg ) , triple roundabouts ( i think ? 
  maybe i was just thinking of [ this ... thing ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/place/nantes/@47.2211515,-1.5561865,87m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4805ee81f0a8aead:0x40d37521e0ded30!8m2!3d47.218371!4d-1.553621!5m1!1e2 ) ) , [ quadruple roundabouts ] ( http://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/1/84/23/42/20150920/ob_f73f80_quadruple.png ) , [ wtf roundabouts ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0w0p2tnlwqu/uijemzpfzwi/aaaaaaaaai4/gkad-x4z-oo/s1600/tridecuple+rond+point.jpg ) , [ sinkhole roundabouts ] ( https://inconvenantes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/rond-point-bouche-dc3a9vier.jpg ) , [ roundabouts with tramways ] ( http://s.minutebuzz.com/i/2015/07/tam-nantes-l.jpg.jpg ) and even roundabouts in the [ cemeteries ] ( https://inconvenantes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/rond-point-misericorde.jpg ) .

   why outlawing foreign radio . 
  i 'm going to guess that you 're talking about the law requiring more than 50 % french languages songs on radio ? 
  it helps french artists and french-speaking artists , thus encouraging the national scene as well as foreign artists who sing in french , while making us slightly less part of the uniform global western culture . 
  i think there is no disadvantage in this . 
  no , it 's just that the way the map has been coloured gives a bad idea of borders between regions . 
  i 'm pretty sure the limit between charente-maritime and vend\u00e9e is very clear in this instance in reality . 
  i 'm from the very south of vend\u00e9e in the light blue area , and never heard `` chocolatine '' until i met people from toulouse . 
  `` a '' is a bit different from the usual `` a '' but i do n't know how to explain it , `` e '' is sometimes pronounced as '' \u00e9 '' instead of the schwa , and in the other cases it 's more often silent than usual ( it 's easy to see in city names , like saint-renan which is just `` sain-rnan '' or gu\u00e9men\u00e9 which is gu\u00e9mn\u00e9 , when most people would say r_eu_nan and g\u00e9m_\u00e9_n\u00e9 ) . 
  that 's why the most usual remark is that bretons speak fast . 
  but it 's not so different that you would notice it if you do n't really care . 
  hmm , also yeah , the `` os '' thing i guess . 
  i still ca n't get myself to say just `` o '' , it feels so wrong ( and i never know which one should be plural and which one should be singular ) . 
  i 'm not really breton though , but a bit influenced . 
  we usually say that around angers has no accent . 
  i think it would be accurate enough to say that it 's basically the pays-de-la-loire region which does n't have an accent ( or at least , has the reference accent for france ) . 
  i think the nicest accent is in the south-west , it 's less in-your-face than the south but still quite ... 
  i do n't know how to describe it , but it 's just nice to hear . 
  the worst is undoubtedly in the north ( where i live ) . 
  i do n't like to criticise something that 's not really the fault of people who speak it , but it does sound ... retarded . 
  honestly , when i first arrived here and i met someone who spoke to me in some chti/french mix , i thought he was a bit retarded . 
  turns out he 's just a normal guy and it 's the local accent . 
  most other accents ( like in brittany , paris , lyon ) are actually very slight and you probably would n't notice them at all without being a native and living long enough near the place . 
  to be honest though , cities do n't have a lot of power in france . 
  they do have the power to fund mosques using some clever tricks , but then , right-wing cities have done it at least as often as left-wing ones . 
  the three largest projects have been marseille , bordeaux and mulhouse and of these three , the last two are right-wing . 
  also , the website you 're quoting is far right and every single article is trying to bash the socialists in one way or another . 
   denmark is not yet multi cultural like the french france is n't really multicultural anymore though ( i 'd say the final nail in the regional identities coffin was wwi ) even if it 's still multiracial of course . 
  only at the last stage though , i think it 's obvious she was really nervous at that point . 
  the first presentation of herself she did a bit earlier was quite nice . 
  she does fencing and is studying to be a lawyer , so i think her intelligence is probably ok enough for me at least . 
  we all know how europe and eu are mostly interchangeable terms today . 
  the eu has appropriated the term `` europe '' in the same way the usa are now `` america '' . 
  this sub is the best example of that , it is called r/europe and has the eu flag on its header . 
  as much a colony as brittany or nizza , though . 
  well , it 's actually been french for much longer than nizza . 
  in the same way that locking up children would prevent child abuse , yeah i guess ? 
   fool play not to sound pedantic but i just want to help : it 's `` foul play '' , and not pronounced really the same . 
  fool is pronounced like `` foule '' and means `` idiot '' , foul is pronounced ... something different , with the o and u somewhat separate , and means `` mauvais/malhon \u00eate '' . 
  completely agree on your post , though !, 
  stop it with your numbers and statistics !, 
  the people are tired of those , listen to your gut feeling instead !, 
  everything was better before , was n't it ? 
  that people deliberately forbid their government from collecting such statistics , you mean . 
  at least for france . 
  the government itself would be most happy to collect them .
