  i 'd just like to say that `` over the border '' from antwerp is the netherlands , not france . 
  france would be `` over the border on the opposite side of belgium '' , which is n't that far really , but still not exactly what the guy who wrote that intended to say . 
  pollution in france does n't come from electricity production , it comes from the fine particles emitted by diesel engines in cities . 
  in germany or poland , there will be a lot more co2 emissions but this is n't dangerous for health , as well as some soot probably , but it 's also not as dangerous as the particles are not as fine , and modern coal plants should be able to filter them quite well actually . 
  these emissions are also probably generated outside city centers and more spread out over the countries . 
  well , i 'm from western france and now in the north i really hate how the sun sets even earlier than it should . 
  i do n't need sun in the morning , i 'd prefer having more of it after work . 
   what i do n't get in millenials who rediscover christian values is their incessant need to push them onto others . 
  it 's basically the same reaction as pc culture , only pushing in a different direction . 
  at least in france , the general position of the republic has shifted from universalism to relativism , from considering that one set of values ( basically , the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , and the subsequent interpretations that led to the separation of state and church , etc ) was just universally better than any conflicting opinion , to accepting that some people have different values and not rejecting them altogether . 
  so , other universalist groups like the monotheist religions , that used to be kept in check by a state that was legally and morally above them , are now more and more free to preach their own values , even when they are not compatible with the original values of our republic , and occupy the moral space left vacant by the state . 
  my personal opinion is that this is only happening because people have forgotten how some powerful groups ( mostly the various branches of islam and christianity because that 's their nature , but it could be anything else ) will always try hard to push their ideas , and how our state has very effectively kept them at bay for a bit more than a century . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm saying * gone * correctly , now i have to find how * cone * is supposed to be pronounced . 
  * edit * okay , i was wrong . 
  damn you , english language . 
  it would be easier if you did n't use the latin alphabet at all , instead of misleading us into thinking pronunciation has anything to do with orthography . 
  the usual saying is :  better be on the right than on the left , because you know that the right-wing ones will try to fuck you in the ass , so you 're prepared for it . 
  the left-wing will fuck you in the ass as well , but you do n't expect them to , so in the end they fuck you deeper . 
  not when their target is your country . 
  not modern french in any case . 
  i loved how the lira had braille on it . 
  i wonder why the euro does n't , it does n't take that much space really ... 
  why though ? 
  possibly eliminating the ps altogether would be nice , sure , but what if he loses the primary ? 
  he represents something completely different from the ps , it would be not just a shame , but plain antidemocratic , if he had to just abstain from being a candidate to the presidential election at all . 
   what 's most interesting to me about this chart is that countries which fare better are way more pessimistic than the poorer , less developed ones . 
  objectively speaking this chart should be upside down , since life for the average french citizen is going to be much better than life for the average chinese for the foreseeable future at least . 
  you 're not seeing it the right way . 
  the countries which fare better are the ones where citizens are n't content with what they have . 
  the indians and chinese will not actively fight for better living conditions if they feel theirs are good enough . 
  the french will , even if objectively it 's not that bad , because nothing is ever good enough . 
   secularism must guarantee that the political power is independent from religion . 
  it much guarantee that the law is for everyone and free from bigotry . 
  but it does n't have to stop people to express their religion . 
  so you 're basically saying you agree with the decision in this article ? 
  that a city should not use its administrative power and its citizens ' money to build a statue to some religion watching over the residents of the city , who should be free from bigotry ? 
  i find interesting that the dutch name `` roeselare '' actually sounds and looks closer to the french meaning `` roseli\u00e8re '' than its french name `` roulers '' does . 
   also the standard 90 speed limit in france , even on roads where 60km/h is really pushing the limits in those narrow twisty roads it 's a game of who dares to go faster . 
  i 've had the same kind of remarks a few times , by belgians , but really ... when you 're used to these small countryside roads , 90 km/h feels just fine on them . 
  just slow down a bit and put the right-hand wheels on the grass when another car arrives in front of you . 
   first you say we have a problem with `` them '' as if you know exactly who did this , then you ask who they are ? 
  i assumed he was talking about our problems with monks and religious people in general ? 
  i 'm no expert , but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_toponymy and https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/toponymie_fran%c3%a7aise#noms_germaniques do n't seem to talk about a link between - acum and - ingen ( the french article says - ing / - ingen came after - acum ) * or * between - ange and anything else than - ingen . 
  also , which places does it miss ? 
  for france it 's using the names of communes from 2014 straight from ign , for the other countries it uses less clearly defined places from openstreetmap . 
  i 'm pretty sure the - ange in france and in the netherlands are n't related , instead - ange and - ingen are related . 
  https://ssz.fr/places/?eu#ange$/ingen$/ ( can take a while to load ) ( actually it 's a whole spectrum around [ ing/inge/ingen / ange/ang and even ain or an , but it gets muddied at some point because other words end up with the same suffixes ] ( http://ssz.fr/places/?eu#[ai]nges?$/inge?n?$/ ) ) basically meaning '' - family '' if i understand it right . 
   a pretty bad few years with integration but is n't that more a problem for the country who took refugees in ? 
  i do n't think anything has changed much in france the last few years regarding integration . 
  i also think that every from fillon to le pen is * some kind * of far right , they all are on a spectrum of the nationalistic , reactionary right . 
  though the real hard far-right is recently being replaced by this de lesquen idiot , and i would n't be surprised to hear if he was actually propped up by the fn to make themselves look more moderate . 
  but yes , i think it 's reasonable to call the nationalistic and reactionary right `` far-right '' . 
  just not the nazi or fascist far-right . 
  because sarkozy or hollande were not president at the time of iraq . 
  chirac was kinda the last responsible president we had , he knew what he was doing , the ones after him mostly look like they like playing with the country they 're in charge of like it 's their new toy . 
  huh , usually it 's more the qu\u00e9becois who insist very much that they are n't french . 
  at least when they are with french people , but i can see how they would react differently with anglos . 
  i know you are joking ( well i hope so ) but qu\u00e9bec people are not french , anymore than americans or south africans are english . 
  i say that just in case , because you know , there are people who actually do n't understand that . 
  also , both routes cross exactly five countries , with only germany common to both . 
  well , some of the neo-gothic cathedrals in france are nice and are n't going anywhere , but the truth is a lot of the smaller ones are really of no interest whatsoever and mostly all look the same . 
  they 're not a special part of history , not especially unique and not particularly well built either . 
  quite a few of them had funding problems and ended up cutting corners , or were never even finished . 
  if i read the numbers correctly , about 5 % of all churches `` might '' be demolished , and a bit less than 1 % are `` in danger '' . 
  all of those are from the late 19th or 20th century though , and none are classified as historical monuments . 
  i do n't think this is really a great loss . 
   telling french they have to `` breed with africans and arabs '' ( personally nothing against interracial relationships , but pushing it as an agenda is a different thing ) or government will have to force them . 
  ( essentially saying he wants to genocide the european-french population via love and diversity ) where the fuck are you getting your information ? 
  i 'm really interested . 
  because that 's kinda like the exact contrary to what he says . 
  his discourse is not very different from le pen 's these days . 
  i can not enter my office 's building from the back door closest to the bike park , and have to go through the main entrance on foot losing _ at least _ five minutes or so . 
  yeah ok , that 's not that bad . 
  but it 's still a lot of small bothering things in everyday life , even when not having your house searched or your calls listened to ( well , they probably are anyway ) . 
  no , the french state of emergency is n't constitutionally defined . 
  it comes from a 1955 law , which has been deemed compliant with the constitution . 
  the president can declare it for 12 days , but beyond that it has to be a law voted by the parliament . 
  yes , and there is clearly no correlation between state-managed highways and good quality highways : belgian and german highways are state-managed and not very good , dutch highways are state-managed and very good , french highways are private-managed and about as good . 
  sounds like shit americans say . 
  i take it you never drove in france or the netherlands to say that . 
  do you really want france to start invading europe again thoug ? 
  also , in french there a several different ways to ask a question like this , and i do n't know how you would rank the different results . 
  though i just tried , and both `` comment je ... '' and `` comment est-ce que je ... '' bring out `` how do i call myself ? '', 
  first . 
  just `` comment ... '' brings out `` how to vote blank '' and `` comment m ' ... '' gives what could mean either `` how do i put on clothes ? '', 
  or `` what do i wear ? '' . 
  no mention of drinking . 
  the thing is , these international laws are actually in a large part based on the ideas * we * the french people came up with . 
  we 're more likely to try to get other countries to uphold them , than to try to get around them ourselves . 
  not without violating international law , though . 
  it 's actually officially a `` pays '' . 
  people there say `` le pays '' when talking about polynesia , at one point its official designation relative to france was as an `` overseas country '' ( that said , in french `` pays '' can mean simply a region ) . 
  i think country is more appropriate than province here , at least regarding the meanings of these terms in france . 
  to be neutral you could call it a * territorial collectivity * . 
   really ? 
  do you mean that before 1813 , a thus pre-industrial china had single battles involving more than half a million men ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_changping for example , in 260 bc . 
  there are ancient chinese battles with a * very large * ( alleged ) number of soldiers . 
  even though of course these numbers are not reliable at all , the political structure of ancient china was very different from that of rome ( and much more authoritarian ) and made it possible to enlist far larger amounts of men in a way that did not become possible in europe until the french revolution . 
   lack of moral perception is called `` sociopathy '' afaik .
