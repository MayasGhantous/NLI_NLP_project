  going straight through the massif central would only shave a hundred kilometers and some , and link absolutely no major city , so it 's not very likely . 
  in french we have 16 individually named numbers . 
  for actual training kids get paper with larger squares though ( like [ this ] ( http://www.goodoc.net/adpe/graphisme/images/lettres2.gif ) at 6 or so ? ) . 
  this one is just the regular one used by people who already know how to write ( these students are 16 ) . 
  the guidelines just help with writing in a more regular height ... when you use it the right way , of course , not like these guys . 
  not , it 's just regular paper used in school in france . 
  they used it sideways though , which triggers me a bit . 
  that 's not what he was saying or what his supporters thought he wanted , though . 
  but maybe you just know better . 
  well , i 'd consider myself far left and i ca n't make myself hate him : / it 's a weird feeling because i do n't want to like him , but so far , it seems like i do like him somehow . 
  well , it 's actually forbidden by labour law to eat at the desk you use to work . 
  actually , it is [ forbidden to let your employees eat in the office in which they work ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do?cidtexte=legitext000006072050&amp;idarticle=legiarti000018489256&amp;datetexte=&amp;categorielien=cid ) . 
  labour inspection [ can allow an employer of a company with less than 25 employees to let them eat in their office if a separate place is provided for that ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do;jsessionid=d263bc94f9a71652db2c49aaa7a132bc.tpdila11v_1?idarticle=legiarti000033218667&amp;cidtexte=legitext000006072050&amp;datetexte=20170529 ) ( so not their desks ) . 
  i find it much more healthy than how we used to quickly eat sandwiches on our desks when i worked in canada . 
  so the rubis class has ... rubis , saphir , \u00c9meraude , am\u00e9thyste ... perle ( okay , i guess it was n't just precious stones but precious things in general ) and ... casabianca ? 
  okay : o, 
  well he 's in switzerland , so it 's expected that everything should be more expensive than latvia . 
   french fries , one of paris 's greatest gifts to the world french fries are widely recognised as a gift from * belgium * , in europe . 
  in any case they 're really not something from paris ( if they * have * to come from france , then it would be northern france ) . 
  i honestly have no idea what you mean . 
  our president is n't even a member of a party , if that 's the kind of party you mean . 
  ( edit : did i miss a joke or something ? ), 
   the stunning penthouse apartment is the epitome of elegance ... 
  * c\u00f4te * also means `` slope '' though . 
  c\u00f4te-d'or is a wine producing region , and it is covered with slopes planted with vineyards , and which turn golden in autumn . 
  actually , being a spouse is n't supposed to be a job itself . 
  a president 's wife does n't * have * to look cheerful if they do n't want to . 
  he probably * says * he wants the best , but at the same time insists on ridiculous things while being convinced that he knows better than the professionals who are making his suits . 
  some people just ca n't accept external advice . 
  and 2 of the 3 oldest buildings are in brittany . 
  and the other one is still in western france too . 
  that 's a bit surprising ( they 're not especially void regions , either ) . 
  coloured according to population density , too . 
  for the past ten years it has been business as usual . 
  if not willingly , then simply by negligence . 
  hmm ... maybe ( though to be honest i do n't really think so ) . 
  putting the commonwealth after `` foreign '' however sounds to me symbolically very different from putting european before `` foreign '' . 
  of course it 's no surprise , as i said . 
  the question was whether macron was gaining my confidence ( or people who voted like me ) or i was still critical of him . 
  so that was my answer : he still does n't have my confidence , and i 'm still critical of him . 
  le drian is at the european and foreign affairs now though , so his ideas of social matters are going to actually matter from now on . 
  g\u00e9rard collomb is at the interior ministry so it will also matter . 
  does anyone think they will have different policies from hollande 's government though ? 
  that seems very difficult to believe . 
  well , you know how the ps is kinda split between a socialist wing ( more to the left ) and a `` social-democrat '' wing ( less to the left , some would consider them center or even center-right , but this is of course very subjective ) . 
  so i do n't really consider these * socialists * , and i do n't consider it an overture : g\u00e9rard collomb is absolutely economically liberal , i do n't know hulot 's views on social matters , and le drian supported macron instead of his own party 's candidate beno\u00eet hamon , which is a clear indication of how socialist he is ( g\u00e9rard collomb too , anyway ) . 
  i do n't know though , maybe if some politicians i consider socialists now had actually joined this government , i would have been disappointed at them . 
  i do n't know . 
  but it did n't happen anyway . 
   what is the opinion in france , especially those who did not vote for macron in the first round ? 
  does he gain the confidence of the people with these decisions or are they criticial of him because he was not their candidate ? 
  ( i do n't pretend representing the general opinion of everyone like me in france who did n't vote for macron ) to be completely honesti 'm still not pleased of this choice of government . 
  i do n't know if there 's a way i could have been pleased , of course . 
  but i 'm seeing mostly old politicians in all the ministries that count , right-wing or economically liberal center and nobody i truly consider left-wing socialist and i 'm kinda ... meh . 
  it 's just economically liberal business as usual . 
  i 'm not especially displeased with these guys , and i did n't really expect anything else , i 'm just disappointed that there really is no overture on the left . 
  hopefully though , even if we basically keep going with the same policies we have had in the last 10 years , at least they will be conducted with a sense of general positivity and progress this time . 
  in my opinion macron and m\u00e9lenchon were the only candidates with positive arguments instead of mostly negative ones ( say , talking about how to create jobs instead of how to reduce unemployment , or more generally how their programs were good rather than how the other programs were bad ) . 
  even in france quite a lot of the cities that were destroyed by the allies were not nicely rebuilt . 
  they 're known as quite ugly concrete cities today , like le havre , saint-nazaire , royan , brest . 
  only a few of our own cities were rebuilt in style ( especially saint-malo ) so it 's really not surprising that the soviets would n't do that either for their newly occupied territories . 
  le havre is not * the decaying north * , it 's close to paris and has a relatively healthy industry and economy , with a very large harbour , refineries and car factories . 
  it 's not a symbol of anything special . 
  i do n't think anyone really knows him . 
  i do n't . 
  hearing he 's from the right-wing lr party makes me half-angry , half-resigned . 
  i did n't expect a lot to begin with , but still ... 
  yeah , non-breaking but also a bit smaller than regular space . 
   france insoumise is melenchon 's , oui ? 
  it 's just a totally friendly remark , but i 've seen or heard many times people ending their questions in `` oui ? '' . 
  but nobody says that in french , actually . 
  the proper translation for `` right ? '', 
  or `` is n't it ? '', 
  at the end of a question is instead `` non ? '' . 
  so a french-sounding question would be :  france insoumise is m\u00e9lenchon 's , non ? 
  i really hope i did n't sound too unfriendly , it 's just that * someone * has to tell you , or you will never know . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'd like the eu defense hq to be as far as possible from anything nato-related . 
   half of what he says could have been said by le pen . 
  or by a number of other persons as well . 
  what matters is n't exactly what is the same in several candidates ( you know , * even hitler was a vegan * and * stalin pooped every morning * ) . 
  what matters is that the other half ( i 'm not going to argue on whether it is a half , a quarter or two thirds ) is * fiercely opposed * to what the fn advocates . 
  anything that has to do with culture , research , education , religion , is absolutely opposed to what the fn says . 
  he also said he and his voters should and would not give a single vote to le pen ( we know a small part of them will , though ) . 
  i do n't see a problem with not `` endorsing '' another candidate with other ideas that are opposed to his values . 
  there is a very clear difference between what he thinks of macron ( '' * he asks for a vote of support , but even if i do n't support him i will still do what i have to do * '' ) and of le pen ( '' * her ideas are absolutely not compatible with the republic and should be fought everywhere and at all time * '' - he was also an advocate of banning the fn altogether back when it was a smaller party , in 1997 ) . 
  21 % is not a third . 
  it 's a fifth . 
  it 's also exactly the same amount as for the general population . 
  among < 24 year olds , 30 % , so a bit less than a third , voted for m\u00e9lenchon instead who advertised his party as in full opposition to the fn and le pen . 
   it 's discriminatory , not to mention incredibly irresponsible and dangerous to ban models deemed ` unhealthy ' because they are too thin and not also concurrently ban models who are overweight but the overweight models are theoretically banned as well , since what is banned is an `` unhealthy bmi '' . 
  though we all know that they are very few compared to the underweight ones . 
  honestly , you 're just fighting against an incomplete article title here . 
  to be honest i hear about soros from time to time on / r/europe but i have not idea who this is or what he might be doing what theories there might be about him . 
  but young people have voted * en masse * for m\u00e9lenchon and the left , and in 6 years there might be more of them . 
  i see only one explanation , the election was rigged by the establishment !, 
  http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/hauts-de-france/nord-pas-calais/pas-calais/henin-beaumont/faux-tract-marine-pen-perd-son-proces-diffamation-contre-avocat-melenchon-1011181.html for the latest case . 
  well she has a history of fabricating fake information . 
   however , what makes france different from other european countries is that the far right is popular amongst the young people , 21 % of which voted for le pen , making her the most popular candidate for voters who are less than 24 years old . 
  well actually ... that 's wrong . 
  21 % is about the national average , so it 's not especially high ( worrying , right , but not more than the general population ) and the most popular candidate for voters less than 24 years old was [ m\u00e9lenchon , at 30 % ] ( http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/presidentielle-2017-ouvriers-jeunes-ruraux-qui-a-vote-quoi-7788279034 ) .
