  so if france is different from the other european countries , it 's actually in having a * very * left-leaning youth instead of the more moderate , liberal left youth that is common elsewhere . 
   does n't this essentially spell the end of the french left ? 
  not really , i see it as the long due split between the center-left ( to en march ) and the hard left ( their voters went to france insoumise for the presidential election , it remains to be seen what will happen for the legislative ) factions that had been cohabiting uneasily for so long within the ps . 
  that flemish/walloon border in belgium though ... it 's completely wrong ( in reality it 's almost exactly `` horizontal '' and not parallel at all to the french border ) . 
  http://www.leparisien.fr/elections/presidentielle/presidentielle-emmanuel-macron-veut-gagner-sur-son-projet-24-04-2017-6883032.php i 'm not sure where i heard it myself , but i can find this . 
  which explicitly says they 're not going to take into account the ideas of those who will vote for them . 
  but i have to say , it 's not as clear cut as i thought it was . 
  yeah , i really feel like macron has said that so he can claim his future victory will actually be because people support him in order not to have to make any compromise with those parties that could n't reach 2nd turn but which will still make for a majority of his votes in the end . 
  since he got less than 25 % , and will win with more than 50 % , those extra  25 % will come mostly from the left and also significantly from the right . 
  but saying that , he ensures he can just do his own politics and claim a large legitimacy at the same time , and i kinda despise this attitude . 
  it really does n't make me want to vote for him * more * . 
   because they hate macron and le pen just as much and `` capitalism is a form of fascism '' well , i 've heard what you say a lot of times , but i 've exactly never heard anyone actually say they hated macron and le pen * just as much * , or that * they are the same * . 
  instead , i 've heard very nuanced opinions saying that they hate le pen very much and would never ever vote for her , but they also really dislike macron and do not want to vote for him . 
  you will argue that the result is the same : no vote for macron and no vote for le pen , but there is a very clear order of preference between macron and le pen . 
  it 's just that for people who think le pen will not win anyway , and dislike macron a lot , well they do n't want to vote for him , and they think they do n't need to . 
  well , i 'll start with a disclaimer that i 'm never going to vote le pen in my life , but most comments in this discussion are doing exactly the same for her , trying to imagine what 's in her mind despite what she said . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm pretty sure she 's not honest and she 's not saying what she thinks . 
  but macron is most likely doing the same , as are most politicians around the world . 
  luckily , his ideas are in any case nowhere as bad as le pen 's . 
  ten times now !, 
  it 's a bit annoying for me to get all these notifications to be honest . 
  i 'm not denying that , but local senators or european deputies do n't have `` historic voters '' in the context of a presidential election . 
  m\u00e9lenchon has never had high percentages of votes in national elections before now , so it does n't make sense to think that his `` historic voters '' have already defected to le pen ... who , the 6 % who voted for him in 2014 ? 
  it 's obviously the contrary , and those who have defected from le pen to m\u00e9lenchon for the first turn , are most probably going to go back to le pen for the second turn . 
  that is just logic , mate , a party does n't go from 6 % to 20 % over three years by losing historic voters . 
  it 's a bit weird to talk about `` historic voters '' for m\u00e9lenchon since it 's only the second time he runs for presidency . 
  the fact is there are no historic voters for m\u00e9lenchon / france insoumise . 
  instead , these 12 % are actually most probably people who would have voted le pen in the first place if m\u00e9lenchon had not been a candidate , because they might not be fundamentally far-right , but they are against economical liberalism . 
  well we do n't work on sundays anyway , so it does n't matter , but 350 million euros every five years is really a negligible amount . 
  polling stations open at 08:00 and close at 19:00 in most places , and at 20:00 in the large cities . 
  i 'm not sure how it works in the embassies , but in france there are usually about 1000 people to vote in each polling station , so there 's no question that everyone has time to vote . 
  we do n't do fancy things like opening or closing at midnight , weird voting places or whatever . 
  yes , this part is definitely not perfect and not impervious to fraud . 
  it is somewhat mitigated by the fact that anyone can only hold one delegated vote and they have to be in the same station , so it makes it difficult to organise fraud on a large scale . 
  but yes , one person can definitely force the vote of one another if the conditions are right . 
  i 'm not sure if there is any solution to this though , since as long as the vote is n't cast secretly and in public , this will be a problem . 
  no it 's not . 
  you get one day to vote , and only one ( saturday for the western hemisphere , sunday for mainland and rest of the world ) . 
  https://www.rtbf.be/info/monde/detail_presidentielle-francaise-macron-et-melenchon-arrivent-en-tete-en-outremer?id=9587638 ( it 's not actually a direct link , you will have to scroll down ) :  r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9finitifs en guyane :  m\u00e9lenchon ** 24,72 **  le pen ** 24,29 **  macron 18,75  fillon 14,66  hamon 5,69 you win !, 
  i 'm surprised le pen is so high , but knowing a few metropolitan people who have lived for a while in guyane ... maybe i should n't be surprised . 
  because it works and is very effective at preventing fraud , since all votes are cast , opened , counted and reported in public . 
  as long as participation is high and does n't decrease , and citizens seem okay with this , it seems unnecessary to change the process . 
  there are only two ways to vote on french elections . 
  either you go in person to your designated station ( which is either the nearest embassy or consulate if you live abroad ) or you can designate someone ( which has the same station as you ) to vote for you . 
  there not other means of voting , which can be a bit complicated in places with few consulates and long distances , like english canada . 
  not really though , maybe you somehow got a very difference experience of the french social media , but it 's a fact that has been widely acknowledged . 
  with this kind of thinking , only satellite pictures could be `` photos of paris '' for you though , since any other one would be just a photo of some neighbourhood or other, 
  since he 's american i could suggest starmania . 
  the musical in which a real estate tycoon who lives in a golden tower gets elected president of the occident by playing on fear of terrorism and racism ( but it 's from 1976 and it 's not running anymore , which is too bad ) . 
  well , the mayor of paris does n't have [ stellar english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmr0a1srcu ) either ( coincidentally , she 's spanish ) . 
  we also have quite a history of nearly fluent presidents , too . 
  our current one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2wyg8kt3fa ( it 's quite difficult to find longer parts of the speech actually , probably because it 's usuless both to french speakers and english speakers , so it was really aired ... ), 
  you forgot to mention the political side of his programme though , he intends to govern through executive order , which is quite different from merkel , and * can * be viewed as quite authoritarian . 
  well , it is standard practice to reduce sentences by about 25 % or 30 % for good behavior . 
  honestly , i do n't see a problem with this . 
  do you think he would have become a better person with five more years in prison ? 
  23 april 2017 at 23pm i 'm pretty uncertain about this to be honest , let 's see if guiana actually votes m\u00e9lenchon on sunday , 
  this poll has not released numbers for the overseas . 
  * french guiana * ( guinea is something entirely different ) votes very much moderate left usually , i 'm pretty sure they are mostly voting for macron this year . 
  i have n't * found * a single * recent * poll that says that , to be precise . 
  i do n't think a three-month old poll conducted before we even knew the candidates has that much value . 
  if you look closely , my previous post links to an elabe poll ( the same company as yours , just more recent ) . 
  with le pen at 15 % for young people . 
   that is always the same survey that is used to argue that point `` always the same survey '' really ? 
  this one was released on yesterday !, 
  http://elabe.fr/intentions-de-vote-election-presidentielle-2017-11/ this other recent poll , by another company , has the same results . 
  really , i ca n't find a single poll where young people do n't vote significantly less for the far-right than the average population . 
  essayez https://www.youpak.com/watch?v=17kdsc8viay&amp;t=2m30s, 
  are you even reading the posts you reply to ? 
  a few posts above , you can read :  thank you , irish person , for telling me , a frenchman , what values i `` should '' defend like any true frenchman ^ tm . 
  and you were answering this , saying you are not irish . 
  does this make sense now ? 
   fraternit\u00e9 was added later , because the original slogan of libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 et pain ( liberty , equality and bread ) does n't really work as well as a national motto . 
  hmm ... 
  i 'm not sure where you learnt that , but that 's not totally true . 
  `` libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 '' were the original words , at least as soon as 1790 . 
  they became * libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 , ou la mort '' ( liberty , equality , fraternity , or death ) for some time , until `` or death '' was eventually dropped again soon after . 
  wait ... what is this nonsense , now ? 
  you did n't , not did i imply you did . 
  any resident of the island of ireland should identify as irish . 
  see , i too can tell you what you should think . 
  he says the sanctions have been imposed on russia at the demand of germany ( and against the opinion of many other eu countries , he lists greece , italy , cyprus , spain , austria and a few others ) . 
  he implies that the current members of ukrainian government ( at the time , in 2015 , to be honest i do n't know much about ukrainian politics ) are far-right and used the maidan events , which he says were of more left-wing values , to rob the movement 's momentum and get into power , by bringing up ethnic questions that were not there in the original protestations . 
  he then goes on to say that these far-right members of the government have neoliberal economical ideas , ties with the industry and economy , and therefore interests in not improving the actual situation of the people while diverting their attention to other matters , with russia being the main , easiest target . 
  [ that 's a very common left-wing idea , that the liberal right , or far-right , actually have interests in making or keeping people poor while diverting their attention to other things ] . 
  in the end , the point seems to be that the ukrainian government , corrupted by neoliberalism , in accord with germany , actively tried ( tries ? ), 
  to play up the antagonism with russia so they can pursue their own personal goals of enrichment . 
  the article here says that ukrainian economy is very dependent on russia and that cutting ukraine off from russia without building sustainable relations with the eu first is bad for ukraine . 
  he then says that the end goal of the whole operation ( of distancing ukraine from russia ) is to make ukraine a place suitable for outsourcing cheap work from the economical powers of the eu under neoliberal policies , and that in the end this will not benefit ukrainian citizens . 
  i 'm not commenting on this analysis , just explaining it in more factual terms than `` he wants to remove sanctions to help the ukrainians '' . 
  keep in mind the original is 15 paragraphs long too , it 's a lot more developed than my comment or the previous one . 
  they have been linked to in this thread : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 but that 's not the question you were asking . 
   maybe germany fancies alsace lorraine again , will melanchon be `` fair '' with them ? 
  we could conduct self-determination referendums there , but there is no pro-german sentiment ( some independentist sentiment at most ) . 
  if a referendum there was for joining germany , who would have a right to tell them no to ? 
  in 1958 we did have such a referendum in saarland , which decided on joining germany . 
  and it did join germany alright ( it had been switching between france and germany for three centuries or so by then ) . 
  i really do n't think you can accuse france of not being fair on the question of self-determination . 
  but * you * , as well as most politicians , are the ones talking about a `` stern '' stance . 
  jlm is talking about a * fair * one .
