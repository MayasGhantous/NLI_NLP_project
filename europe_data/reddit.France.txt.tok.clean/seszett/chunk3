  even though the us and the uk are indeed quite close today , i think you might want to add some nuance to your statement . 
  like , when england was invaded and basically ruled by french guys for a few centuries , i 'm pretty sure it was closer culturally and politically to france than it is to the us now , for example . 
   no government should actively hide information from its own citizens , regardless of the intentions behind it . 
  that 's not how a constitution works . 
  the citizens have banned the government , as one of the fundamental values of our nation , from collecting data on our ethnicity and religion . 
  nobody prevents a private organisation from doing so though , all that matters is that the government has no right to do it . 
   if only the french government were n't too cowardly to tell us how much of saint-denis is muslim !, 
  i really hate this kind of remark because it makes people think the government is hiding things on purpose , when it 's a constitutional safeguard against prejudice towards minorities that prevents them from doing that . 
  it 's been judged as a constitutional requirement last time in 2007 , it 's not going to change anytime soon . 
  you would n't accuse the us government of being `` too coward to ban free speech '' would you ? 
  do n't blame the french government for following our constitution . 
  so a 14 year old kid killed himself because bureaucracy made his life a misery even though he had all the legal rights to travel to the uk , and all the comments i 'm reading here are `` how stupid he was ! '', 
  and making fun of it or saying you just do n't care ? 
  maybe [ / r/europe ] ( / r/europe ) ans could use a little bit more empathy . 
  sounds like the word for `` dickhead '' in french , i 'm ok with it . 
  i 'm afraid you 're not answering my comments but instead answering what your own prejudice makes you imagine i am saying . 
  i usually quote the points i 'm answering so it is clear ( even to myself ) that i 'm answering actual words . 
  i think you should try doing this exercise next time you get offended by a comment as innocuous as mine was . 
   belgians do n't charge us , so we should n't charge them . 
  well yeah , but they also do n't use your roads while you use theirs every summer , see what i mean ? 
  i was just saying that because finding a way to make the dutch pay for belgian roads is an actual topic in belgium , showing how just making a difference between countries with and without tolls is n't an answer to anything . 
  also , i do n't really think you could actually charge citizens from countries which just happen to have private companies in charge of some of their roads . 
  if you do n't like the tolls , just take the free roads , they exist in every country . 
   so in the east a woman who is raped for not covering herself is at fault no , you are actually being insulting now . 
   we should point out how dangerous it is for not doing so yes , because it is dangerous . 
   advertise ` you just have to cover yourself than its fine and you are safe '' obiviously not , because `` you * just * have to cover '' implies that it 's no big deal when it actually is , and `` you are safe '' implies that covering up is enough to be safe when it actually is n't . 
   you actually think you can advertise such a thing and in the same time try to make society evolve ? 
  no , you are putting words in my ~ ~ mouth ~ ~ post that i did n't write and would never have written . 
   instead of doing what should obviously be common semse , puniching and blaming criminals ? 
  we should be doing that as well as advising people to pay attention to how the society they live in currently works . 
  you just sound like americans who think abstinence is the answer to birth control and std prevention . 
  what you are advocating is not grounded on reality , it 's completely idealistic and ignores reality . 
   in my opinion all people from countries who charge toll and vignets for their roads should 've to pay for using our roads . 
  yeah , i 'm sure belgians would like to have a word with you about that . 
   so ** instead of ** teaching people that there is nothing wrong with nudity , you are teaching them ` oh no that is like the worst thing in the world ' no , actually he 's not teaching one thing * instead of * the other , it 's perfectly reasonable to advise people not to send naked pics today because it ** is ** a risk today whether you like it or not , and * at the same time * to try to make society evolve towards more acceptance of nudity . 
  except for intransigent idealists like you blaming those who suggest solutions that actually work in the real world of today . 
  next time , try to make the effort to read the whole fucking sentence before writing something stupid . 
   obviously you ca n't jail a corpse seriously , that was ** two fucking words ** after the part you quoted . 
   it does not mean they need to do anything in their power to prevent you from dying a natural death . 
  well in france at least there is the * failure to assist a person in danger * offense , which can get you to prison . 
  if you could have helped a person live without endangering your life and chose not to do so , you could go to prison . 
  giving your organs when you are dead does not endanger your life ( obviously ) and can save someone , so i think it * could * be covered by this law , though obviously you ca n't jail a corpse either so it has to be adapted a bit . 
  but a corpse does n't have legal rights . 
  well i can cite articles that say otherwise too . 
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235057 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21568886 http://www.academie-medecine.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/adjuvants-vaccinaux-rapport-anm1.pdf ( this one just says no proof exists in one way or another , but concludes with `` whatever adjuvent is used , autoimmunity response always has to be taken into account '' , which is obvious ) . 
  reality is n't that vaccines are absolutely always safe , because nothing is always safe . 
  even water and oxygen kill . 
  you just have to try to know the risks as precisely as possible , and weigh them against the advantages . 
  in the case of vaccines , advantages largely win and that 's why anti-vaccine sentiment is rather low in france . 
  but the 41 % in france are not against vaccines , as the sentence in the article shows :  the findings show that many countries ( particularly france , bosnia & herzegovina , japan , iran , mongolia and vietnam ) , display much greater confidence in the importance of vaccines than in their safety . 
  this suggests that people do not necessarily dismiss the value of vaccination even if they have doubts about how safe vaccines are . 
  they 're just conscious that nothing is absolutely safe . 
  we do n't even know what the question was , it might have been something like `` do you think vaccines are always safe ? '', 
  to which it is very reasonable to answer `` no '' . 
   they were wearing sport shorts they were not wearing shorts . 
  not sport shorts , not casual shorts , not beach shorts , not shorts . 
  that you keep saying they were in fact wearing shorts when the victims themselves say they were not is a clear sign that you are not paying attention to facts at all . 
  they were not even wearing shorts contrary to media reports . 
  just another fake `` affair '' created by medias in order to sell , if you ask me . 
   it also looks like their material capabilities are minimum it looks like their mental capabilities are n't maximum either . 
  german verb would be * schneien * , spanish would be * nevar * , italian would be * nevicare * , dutch * sneeuwen * , breton * erc ` han * . 
  i think that 's enough to deduce that using the verb for french was a mistake . 
  as was * niver * for walloon . 
  it made me realise how french `` canif '' ( pocketknife ) has the same origin as `` knife '' too . 
  which should have been obvious all along i guess . 
   the international date line 's only useful for timezones , though . 
  theres not some magical property that separates water on one side and the other you 'll notice that this map is n't actually using the international date line itself as a reference ( both islands are on the same side of the line ) but the 180 \u00b0 meridian , which is conveniently situated 180 \u00b0 away from france , and therefore seems perfectly suitable to divide earth into west and east relative to france . 
  indeed , you could do better by taking the centroid of the total territory of france , which is probably very close to 0 \u00b0 , maybe one degree east or so . 
  so this would be two different islands , and change basically nothing at all to the map . 
   also , im still not sure i agree the comparison between scotland and french polynesia , but i canr really think why right now . 
  there are probably a lot of differences , but from what i understand of uk politics , the creation of the government of polynesia actually closely matches the process of devolution in the uk . 
  new caledonia might , [ somewhere before 2018 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noum%c3%a9a_accord ) . 
  french polynesia does n't seem to be willing to move towards independence anymore , and wallis-et-futuna are very much opposed to leaving . 
  mainland france is at about 0 \u00b0 though , so this arbitrary line in the ocean that is usually called the international date line also divides neatly the world into east and west relative to mainland . 
  and since polynesia , wallis-et-futuna and new caledonia are so spread out around this area , even if this line is n't * exactly * the right one the result would be almost the same but with different islands , if you take say 178 \u00b0 or 182 \u00b0 as the exact opposite of mainland france . 
  also , they are indeed part of france , french territories have some autonomy , but they 're still entirely part of france and subject to the same national laws , they 're basically as much part of france as scotland and northern ireland are part of the uk . 
   france ca n't control it 's immigrant problem why should the british suffer for their poor border controls . 
  i keep reading this here , but you do realise that schengen means border control has not been up to france for decades , now ? 
  you should be whining at spain , italy , slovenia or hungary really , because only a very small fraction of these immigrants have actually entered schengen from france , and border control is up to the external borders of schengen . 
  and before you start with the usual `` but our neighbour is france and we are n't part of schengen so it 's not our problem '' , yes , * yes * it is your problem , because it 's been long enough that your government should have taken schengen into account and acted accordingly , the touquet agreements came once schengen was already there as well . 
  whining about french border control wil just not achieve anything and everyone knows it . 
  border control is probably even more absent in the netherlands , too . 
  the idea of public service is n't pressuring citizens into moving to places where it 's easier to provide them public service , though , it 's to provide them service wherever they are . 
  sure it would be easier to get everyone to just live in one big city and not have to provide electricity or water anywhere else , but that would be the exact opposite of public service . 
  and i think train 's strength is rather linking distant dense areas , while inside high-density areas it can never get to high speed because the distances are too short . 
  there are other kind of rail systems adapted to this like tramway or metro , but they 're not the ones we are talking about in this topic though . 
   the leader of the center right would n't that be hollande ? 
  you never heard anyone say they disliked the germans or the english ? 
  i have , a lot of times . 
  but i think they 're the only ones that are sometimes disliked . 
  well at the time of the roman empire trans/cis were relative to rome , but we are a free nation now , so we use our own country as our reference  in france , and in french-speaking switzerland as well as far as i know , * transalpin * really means italian , and for our other neighbours we mostly use `` outre - '' ( which is just the native french version of latin trans - , really ) like * outre-manche * for england , * outre-rhin * for germany , * outre-atlantique * for the us , and even * outre-qui\u00e9vrain * for belgium , though only humouristically . 
  for some reason , * outre-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es * or * transpyr\u00e9n\u00e9es * are n't used for spain . 
  it would have been more correctly translated as `` from across the alps '' though . 
  * transalpin * in france usually refers to italy as well , by the way , 
  their laptops are rather good , except for the power cords ;, 
  i know little about moldova but i have to wonder , do moldovans feel very different from romanians , like a different * nation * ? 
  is there any unionist sentiment ? 
  i 'm just wondering if moldova is more in the same situation as belgium , just speaking the same language as a neighbour ( or two ) but with little cultural connection to them , or if it exists separately more because of an accident of the ussr . 
   imagine if it were the other way round , the outrage french people would have , bloody roast beefs allowing migrants to pass into our country i do n't think people are really very outraged at the italians and spanish for `` letting '' migrants come to france , though . 
   you wo n't board the train or ship without a passport just as it is now .
