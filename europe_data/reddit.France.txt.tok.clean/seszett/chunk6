  i would have had the same hesitation before clicking on bloom.se or bloom.be . 
  just `` bloom '' is n't something that seems to have a link with economy , not well-known like bloomberg , and '' . bg '' ( or '' . se '' or '' . be '' ) did n't seem to have a lot of reasons to talk about the french economy . 
  hence , * random * . 
  i like domain hacks like any other web developer , but i 'm just not very fond of them being used for no special reason other than just shortening a url by a few characters , making them less obvious , and muddying the purpose of national tlds . 
  yep i know , but i think was the gp refers to as `` the dole '' is rsa , and not unemployment welfare . 
  the fact is a lot of people are on rsa and not counted as unemployed as you said above , and that 's completely absurd . 
   what tools does the french state have to use with regards to those people ? 
  what are the next steps ? 
  nothing special , they get welfare because we 're a socialist country and we do n't believe people should just disappear or become beggars because they do n't have a job . 
  but this has nothing to do with being counted as jobless , which is the problem here . 
  what do you think the next steps should be ? 
  usually the answer will be `` force them to work '' ( hence taking jobs that would have been paid otherwise ) or `` give them nothing '' ( leading to little more than increasing crime ) . 
  you might not struggle with high wealth inequality , but your poverty rate is higher than the french one . 
  i 'm not sure that sounds a lot better . 
  * bloom.bg * ? 
  am i the only only who hesitated before following this link because it looked like some random bulgarian website ? 
  nope , since that 's a protest that happened in 2014 when israel invaded gaza . 
  in sarcelles , not paris . 
  we have one in france , but it 's not standardized and part of it is more an interview than a regular test . 
  but i do n't even know why you 're telling me that . 
  i 'm just saying you should use nuances , and then you answer with the same kind of baseless absolutes we keep hearing everywhere . 
  that never helped anyone think correctly about the current situation . 
  to me , people like you advocating more liberalism and flexibility and less protection and less constraints like everywhere else `` because our neighbours are doing better '' are the stereotypical guys in movies running straight trying to outrun a rolling boulder , instead of taking a few moments to think coolly about the situation and stepping aside . 
  maybe there 's some kind of intermediate state between `` perfect '' and `` impossible '' , do n't you think ? 
  maybe there are even an infinity of states ranging from `` very bad '' to `` pretty good '' , and we 're obviously nowhere near either perfect or impossible . 
  i think most people would say we somewhere around the `` quite bad , but not critical yet '' mark . 
  this is moving away from `` 35 hours is the regular work week and hours beyond that should be paid more '' . 
  but average working time is already higher than 35 hours a week ( the average seems to be [ 39 hours ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/34667552 ) ) . 
   btw english is supposed to be the language here j'ai corrig\u00e9 \u00e7a d'une fa\u00e7on qui va plaire \u00e0 tous les connards d'anglophones de / r/europe !, 
  * i fixed that in a way that will please all our english-speaking friends on / r/europe !, 
  * nope , unless i missed something they did n't even vote for their own impeachment motion , and it did n't get enough votes to be proposed at all !, 
  * * to me it 's even worse , i think they had neither the testicles to vote for their own impeachment motion , or to vote for the right-wing motion . 
  a beautiful skewer of assholes in any case . 
  i think you 're missing something , because unlike what you can hear about how flexibility ( read : firing people at will ) is absolutely crucial and other common liberal brainwashing , it looks like france has managed quite fine to run businesses in the last century or so , and it has been pretty far from liberal in all this time . 
  today , it 's still obviously ** possible ** to run a business without labor flexibility , i mean france is n't a communist country with no businesses . 
  the businesses do run , some of them are world leading . 
  i work for `` a business '' , unless startups do n't count somehow . 
  it 's just obvious that your sentence , widely repeated by most politicians and in the media , is plain wrong . 
  * the `` rebels '' of my testicles who did n't vote for the impeachment procedure . 
   feels like germany and france alone are running the whole eu the uk and italy have as much representation as france , so if they are n't running the eu that 's probably because they do n't want to . 
  stone is cooler in summer , and we rarely have ac in our houses . 
  also , stone ( or brick ) lasts centuries . 
  wooden frames less so . 
  really ? 
  i 'm living on the border between france and belgium and i have yet to find a difference between them , apart from some sauces not being available on both sides . 
  i 'm not sure french citizens want the british to say . 
  was n't there a poll saying more french people actually wanted brexit than brits ? 
  they could very well have been in northern france where fries are as popular as in belgium , actually . 
  which still does n't make fries french of course , but it would make the soldiers seem less ignorant . 
  why do you like germany more than france ? 
  :'( we dislike you slightly less than they do !, 
  ( i personally do n't know much about romania , but i like you just because you have a romance language , and i imagine transylvania as quite interesting to visit ) . 
  well it was even worse when i drove through germany last week . 
  ok maybe not worse , but about the same , i was really surprised with the amount of roadworks everywhere . 
  but at least most highways were in good enough shape ( except for this weird noisy coating that always makes me think my car is making a abnormal noise ) though belgium has improved a lot lately , especially in flanders . 
  repulsive maybe , if you 're heterosexual that seems understandable , but offensive ? 
  i have difficulty imagining how it could be * offensive * if you are n't homophobic . 
  l'express is very dishonest though . 
  there are two possible referendums . 
  one , if things go according to `` plan a '' , would be on whether or not to accept the treaties renegotiated between france and the other countries of the eu . 
  a `` no '' to this one referendum would mean m\u00e9lenchon would stand down and things would keep going as they are going now ( well , not necessarily exactly the same , as there would be a constituent assembly going on in parallel ) with no question of leaving the eu . 
  the other possible referendum would be in case of definitive failure of the negotiations ( as in , a categorical refusal by the other members of the eu to talk about modifying the structure of the eu ) . 
  that 's `` plan b '' . 
  then , there would be a referendum on leaving the union or not . 
  l'express is conflating the two options either out of dishonesty ( that 's a very , * very * economically liberal newspaper and to be frank i 'm not trusting it to be honest about any candidate other than macron ) or simply because they did n't make the effort of thinking about the programme because they have not taken him as a serious candidate until just the last few days . 
   i only know he wants a referendum that seems pretty similar to what the uk had . 
  he does n't , though . 
  he wants to renegotiate treaties with the rest of the eu , hoping france could federate at least several other countries around his core ideas , and if he absolutely fails to reach anything acceptable then he would do a referendum on leaving . 
  he has said multiple times that the `` leave referendum '' option is really only there because you ca n't weigh in negotiations if you do n't have some kind of threat , which was the problem of greece in his opinion . 
  that 's pretty different from the uk because it would n't be a straight list of demands ( and bullshit ones , really ) but more like a multi-year negotiation between 27 countries on making the eu change . 
  that 's not what the document you gave me says . 
  it says `` rupture unilat\u00e9rale '' . 
  which does n't mention article 50 or a referendum . 
  you quoted it yourself though . 
  and article 50 is absolutely unilateral . 
  it does n't need any agreement from the remaining countries . 
   yes , a referendum about what will be negotiated . 
  not a referendum about leaving . 
  yeah , that 's where i refer you to my last sentence about the useless activity of looking for loopholes in non-binding speech . 
   it does n't say what happens if the people do n't agree with the result of the negotiations . 
  thats why he said , in the other link , that he would stand down in case of a failed referendum . 
  i said it already in my previous post . 
  that is within plan a and it 's been explained in a perfectly clear way . 
  leaving the eu is plan b. 
  in case negotiations themselves fail . 
  then a referendum on leaving the eu would happen ( as is mandatory per our constitution anyway ) . 
  would this referendum fail , he would stand down ( * that * has not been stated explicitly , but that 's not what you 're arguing about and this situation is pretty pointless i think , things would obviously have to be improvised in this case ) . 
  would it `` succeed '' if you can call that success , then he would trigger article 50 . 
  i found the relevant part for you here at 21:00 ( same show i linked before , but this one does n't have youtube ads ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxkp5lowp74  ** whatever ** happens , it will end with a referendum . 
  [ ... ] if people tell me to sign , i sign , if they tell me not to , i do n't . 
  he then goes on to say that de gaulle resigned after his referendum failed and that he has a sense of responsibility , and ends with :  in front of such a failure of mine , if i show people an agreement and they do n't accept it , * obviously * i 'm standing down . 
  i tried to keep the same emphasis as him . 
  you can most probably find loopholes in what he says , but spoken words are not binding anyway so it 's kinda pointless to argue about that . 
  his attitude and intentions are pretty clear . 
  feel free not to trust him and to vote for someone else . 
   why on earth would you build a monument for such a man ? 
  because he saved france from being obliterated by the many successive coalitions of the neighbouring monarchies which tried all they could to keep french citizens from making our own political choices . 
  they did succeed at the seventh try , but by then france with napoleon had managed to fuck things up enough that a return to the old state of affairs was not possible anymore . 
  he was n't the father of modern france , but he was one of its saviours . 
  on this topic , i have to say about this part of the original article :  a first-time visitor to paris from elsewhere in europe might flinch at the monuments to napoleon .
