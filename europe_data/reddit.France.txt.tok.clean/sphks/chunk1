it is so crazy i will go with `` attempt '' . 
  the french governments tried to make such populism discriminations . 
  europe forbid it . 
  so ... you 've been there to see the architecture ? 
  because that 's my point . 
  i think people said this about the fascist architecture in roma . 
  maybe i am stupid , but i consider this as a long term investment for the country . 
  you do n't visit rome , athen , paris , bruxelles ... for their beaches . 
  obviously it would have been better to build a university or an hospital . 
  you mean disney stories are inspired from old europe , grimm stories , etc. 
  it 's all about fashion . 
  the `` ds '' sub-brand is about design and tuning . 
  when buying a ds , you can select tons of design options ( the texture of the roof , the color of the roof , the color of the rest of the car , the look of the wheels , the color of the wheels , carbon fiber inside , etc. ), 
  these are bottles to share since our typical glass of beer is ( only ) 25cl . 
  and people of the west drink anything ( cider , beer , wine , chouchen , calva ... ), 
  in france , most of the beer bottles are 25 or 33cl . 
  you can also find 75cl bottles . 
  but it 's hard to find 50cl bottles . 
  and the standard glass in bars is the `` demi '' ( 25cl ), 
  analysts say russia may end up annexing between 0 % and 100 % of ukrainian territory , which is around half of it . 
  and i 'm an alcoholic with a funny hat under the rain . 
  my bad . 
  i misplaced the `` larzac '' ... [ i have already made some corrections but i will continue later ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2f8two/france_as_seen_by_french/ck72nqc ), 
  to answer your question seriously , due to the history , the alsace-loraine people have strong cultural ties with the germans ( dialect , wooden architecture , food ... ) . 
  [ france seen by paris ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mtb6hrp6pss/tgz5u6kkoli/aaaaaaaaar4/nkj7l2al_00/s1600/screen+shot+2010-08-19+at+2.25.00+am.png ) .

  they are getting the belgian nationality to put their assets in monaco . 
  this is a loophole concerning an agreement between france and monaco , where french individuals having their assets in monaco are taxed as any french individual . 
  to get the belgian nationality , they have to have a house in belgium . 
  but they actually live in france . 
  it looks like the fate of every good scientific show is to become some crap . 
  in france , we have `` e = m6 '' since the 90 's . 
  now it 's about consumerism and why you should buy such tooth-brush brand ... 
  what is it about ? 
  compared to / r/schland ? 
  / r/pedale / for the french equivalent, 
  / r/polandball / r/britishproblems / r/shitamericanssay / r/europeanfederalists, 
  it 's just that the default / r/movies / subreddit is mostly about us blockbusters ( old or new ) , where / r/truefilm / is more about world wide films , including european ones . 
  also : http://www.reddit.com/r/truefilm/comments/2d7naa/announcement_truefilm_theater_now_for_europeans/, 
  i would love to see a tech related subreddit but more eu friendly . 
  currently , / r/gadgets is the best regarding this issue . 
  especially because it 's about the products and not about the services ( comcast and al. ), 
  nor the political concerns ( nsa ... ), 
  i would love to see the flag flair on the whole reddit website . 
  i really do n't see a boycott being realistic . 
  but it would be fun , the billions invested for ... no team comming . 
  i can see then russia organising its own cup , like what was recently said with the eurovision . 
  the `` federation '' organising such an event would need to invest cash for it to be successful ( inciting talented football players to play ) . 
  i can see the quatar to be such investor ... 
  maybe you should not be authorised to win it twice in a row . 
  why is this relevant ? 
  especially in / r/europe . 
  according to wikipedia , it has been internationalised in 2011 . 
  in france , it 's occurring since 1982 . 
  we have a recent thing in france called `` f\u00eate de la musique '' . 
  everybody is invited to play instruments and sing outside . 
  it seems stupid but it 's a great night to visit big cities . 
  that you use once and that you can recycle . 
  estimated to 200 years at the current rate of consumption with current technology and being economically viable . 
  it 's not that much . 
  we need to develop new kinds of reactors . 
  and it is probable that the consumption will grow fast , for example if china develop nuclear power plants in the next century . 
  uranium is a finite ressource, 
  on another thread , someone explained that it could be aluminium since geothermal power is everywhere there , free , and that aluminium only needs energy ( and dirt with al ), 
  and what does the machine to make the clown face looks like ? 
  is it real ? 
  if so , how is it done ? 
  there are special machines to extrude wurst with any picture ? 
  it 's a shame that the rule about singing in our native language has disappeared . 
  eurovision is about cultural variety , not about winning a game ( in my opinion ) . 
  pro tip : you can click no ( not install anything ) and still see the video, 
  [ we have lots of local ciders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cider#national_variations ), 
  there is a small language war to name a traditionnal pastry `` pain au chocolat '' or `` chocolatine '' . 
  it 's the same thing but what is fun is that before the internet , most of french people just did n't know that it was called differently between the south east of france and the rest . 
  so , if a parisian on vacation asked for a `` pain-au-chocolat '' in the south-east , he will not be understood . 
  and a toulousain in the north , asking for a `` chocolatine '' would be asked `` whut ? '', 
  i doubt that foreigners will understand this one :-), 
  i find the french wikipedia awful for science related articles ( computer , biology ... ) . 
  a lot of french article are biased or is full of pseudo-science . 
  i try to correct them but it 's a tough work . 
  just an example : [ aneth ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/aneth ), 
   '' * as a general clarification , ounce for ounce , coal ash released from a power plant delivers more radiation than nuclear waste shielded via water or dry cask storage . 
  * '' now i would be curious about the total weight of flying radioactive coal ash that is released . 
  i agree with you , the worse part is that it ends up in the air , but this is over-sensationalised . 
  for example , france produces more energy than it consumes . 
  it sells ( mostly ) nuclear energy to adjacent countries . 
  i would not say `` more '' . 
  to be fair , i suspect that in this current chart , a small amount of renewable energy for france is nuclear energy converted into hydro . 
  during low power consumption hours , we pump water into dams , to store over-production . 
  thus , during peak cosumption hours , we can use this water instead of starting new power plants . 
  but you already have the material . 
  if you can recycle it , you do n't need more material . 
  it 's not only a current issue in paris ; it 's an issue for a large part of france and europe . 
  why do we hear about paris ? 
  i think because of the election of the mayors ( next week ) and because last week an ong complained about public authorities doing nothing about the pollution . 
  i have bought a `` charger '' for my car , a `` charger '' for my work and a `` charger '' for my wife 's work ( when i say charger , i mean a usb cable ) . 
  i am glad i do n't need to buy new chargers whenever i change my phone . 
  my provider makes me pay to receive each sms abroad . 
  i fucking have to pay to receive spam . 
  even if it 's no more than one or two , this infuriates me .
