  in your reasoning , you do n't take into account the mediatisation of the issue : elephants become endangered , if you buy costly ivory stuff we may take it and destroy it . 
  this communication stunt may dissuade potential buyer from being interested in ivory artefacts . 
  less potential buyers = lower prices . 
  of course it 's not your theory or my theory , but a mix . 
  the number of ivory stuff will decrease a little , but the number of potential buyers may decrease a lot ... in france ... for some time .

  take that galaxy !, 
  here is the scientific explanation : `` risks related to blue light the photochemical risk is associated with blue light , and depends on the accumulated dose to which the person has been exposed , which is generally the result of low intensity exposure repeated over long periods . 
  there is a high level of proof of such a risk . 
  evidence from human observation and experimental studies on cell cultures and various animal species has converged to demonstrate the specific toxicity of shortwave ( blue ) light to the retina . 
  blue light is therefore recognised as being harmful and dangerous to the retina , as a result of cellular oxidative stress . 
  there is a strong suspicion that blue light aggravates age-related macular degeneration ( armd ) , based on converging observations on experimental models . 
  epidemiological studies carried out up to now have proved inconclusive as a result of their lack of precision in assessing exposure and the data concerning individual predisposition . 
  three population groups have been identified as being either especially sensitive to the risk or highly exposed to blue light : \u2022 children ( because of the transparency of their crystalline lens ) and both aphakics ( with no crystalline lens ) and pseudophakics ( with artificial crystalline lenses ) who consequently either can not or can only insufficiently filter short wavelengths ( particularly blue light ) ; \u2022 population groups which are already light-sensitive : patients suffering from certain eye ( e.g. 
  armd ) and skin diseases , patients taking photosensitising substances , etc. , for whom blue light may aggravate their condition ; \u2022 population groups highly exposed to leds ( certain categories of workers : those installing lighting systems , theatre and film industry professionals , etc. ), 
  which are subjected to high-intensity lighting , and are therefore likely to be exposed to large quantities of blue light . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://www.anses.fr/documents/ap2008sa0408en.pdf ), 
  there is a controversy with led back light . 
  the light is too blue or something . 
  i do n't know how it 's scientifically correct . 
  thanks . 
  that was informative . 
  then , maybe , the police should protest against this new law . 
  yes . 
  then they learn english as a third language . 
  then they do n't use german anymore and then they have more issues with english than less rich kids .

  we do n't show many french flags . 
  the only places you could find french flags are military and administrative buildings . 
  or during football world cups . 
  this is true , pretty everything is dubbed . 
  recently , we are able to view films in `` vo '' ( version originale ) cinemas and more recently on tv channels . 
  this is due to the new generation , used to piracy , and thus used to not dubbed series and films, 
  i can confirm this . 
   people have to pay you money in order to label products like : champagne , cognac is it even possible to label something `` cognac '' for a brandy that is not produced in the city of cognac ? 
  and `` champagne '' for something that is n't produced near the region champagne ? 
  if possible , does it make sense ? 
   after a negative experience in the coast of france which coast ? 
  i would say that the culture is really different from one coast to another one .

  it 's easy really : the french teachers love to cancel classes . 
  when i was a student , during such demonstrations , i remember that we were waiting for the headmaster to know which classes were canceled . 
  really , you only need 2 or 3 students to have clear political demands , a small critical mass of student ( something like 20 % ) not going to classes , and teachers will cancel classes .

  let 's wait for the play-off first ...

  it ca n't be french . 
  the napoleon 's hat is called a ` bicorne ' ( `` two horns '' in french ) .

  this should be called a jacksparrowshat ( or a `` tricorne '' ) .

  i discovered salted licorice when being in vacation in norway . 
  this . 
  delicious . 
  i regret not having bought more of them to bring back at home , because you ca n't find them here . 
  and the salted chocolate too ... ( at least you can find toblerone , which is comparable ), 
  the best beers in france are from local micro-breweries . 
  a good big brand is `` ch ` ti '' in my opinion .

  the best way would be to rent your own ( european ) email server . 
  you can have one for less than 3 $ / month ( 10 emails with 2go of storage each ; and 25go of file storage , to cover your cloud requirement . 
  this is an example , you can find a plan that suits your needs better ) . 
  you may face usability issues , like having to use an ftp client , having a less efficient spam filter , etc. 
  also , if all your friends are using gmail , there is no point to having a more secured email provider .

  correct me if i 'm wrong but the roman polanski story has not shown that france does not extradite people to the us ? 
  edit '' * polanski was born in paris to polish parents and has french citizenship * '' i think it 's because he is french actually . 
  it 's the best dessert in my list , but it costs less than 1 euro at home and is really easy to make . 
  you do n't need to go to the restaurant for that .
