  ( of course , the `` coulis '' is frozen ) . 
  i wanted to write `` fromage blanc '' . 
  [ wordreference translates it with cottage cheese ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/fren/fromage%20blanc ) . 
  [ wikipedia does n't translates it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fromage_frais ) . 
  you will often find `` fromage blanc au coulis de fruits rouges '' as a typical dessert in frozen food restaurants . 
  pro-tip : if the desserts are `` cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e '' , `` chocolate cake '' and `` cottage cheese '' , it is a shitty restaurant . 
  as the author of a blog , i want to get a part of this tax . 
  because what i produce could be printed so many times . 
  thanks . 
  oh and this comment too ; someone could print it . 
  ** nsfw **, 
  that was exactly the same thing in france some years ago . 
  these young hooligans just want to break things , there is no other reason . 
  thanks . 
  my opinion is that he glorified past and he is n't individualistic enough . 
  this explains a lot . 
  he was morally unstable because he was considering his civilization as one big thing . 
  that 's why the gay mariage affected him so much . 
  but civilisation is just an artificial clustering of the mind . 
  each person is an individual , with all his complexity . 
  i do n't think he was stupid . 
  he was mentally unstable . 
  homosexuality was a part of greek civilization , and what a great civilization !, 
  can a psychologist explain me what can lead a man to do this for reasons that are n't directly impacting him ? 
  i just ca n't understand all these french people being against gay mariage and being active ( protestations everywhere , this ... ) my theory is that there are talk groups somewhere where a synergy leads people to be this active against gay rights . 
  maybe churches ? 
  google uses the same strategy . 
  to be fair , this could be done in ireland or in any other european country . 
  and your point and the point of plecboy are both valid . 
  the thing is that these ghost corporations are n't producing much value for europe compared to the quantity of money funneled through them . 
  to be fair , i would prefer that each celebrity spoke in their own language ( with subtitles ) . 
  and the swiss one . 
  they do n't even pretend to play their instrument . 
  to be honest , the singer is talented . 
  so are the dancers . 
  that 's a real performance . 
  [ moskau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqakrw6mtoa ) . 
  i like how the blue power ranger synchronizes back his moves at 3:16 . 
  it was [ malta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wmjxir9xtw ) . 
  it was my favourite . 
  i agree, 
  because they were late . 
  maybe some channels in europe had to cut the show because they planned something else after it . 
  british sketch . 
  i 'm surprised . 
  is it the official reason ? 
  no love for malta ? 
  the guy smiling and the ukulele . 
  i really like the shadow man thing, 
  too shakira-like, 
  it 's written on the loggin popup : reddit is blocking reddit-stream connexions because there are too frequent ( due to this thread actually ) . 
  you just have to wait and retry . 
  barcelona , montpellier , berlin , saint-denis de la r\u00e9union , countryside of palermo but not palermo . 
  because it does n't cost 500 $ to produce a 500 $ note ? 
   english as the official second language why not the first ( and only ) one ? 
   that also means that we are using european tax payers money to save russian mob money devil 's advocate opinion : but we ( if we can personify eu ) first accepted to receive money from them , allowing us to invest . 
  why should we blindly receive money from russia , but do n't give them back their money because this was `` criminal money '' after all ? 
  can someone make a polandball out of this ? 
  like hackers are hired for it security . 
  actually that 's a pretty good idea . 
  sitges ( south of barcelona ) and barcelona . 
  `` rillettes '' is made from fat and meaty parts . 
  the meat is n't mixed so you have a strippy texture . 
  you can find `` rillettes '' of duck meat . 
  `` p\u00e2t\u00e9 '' is made of any meat , livers , etc. 
  yes , we do . 
  :-) any kind of meat , mostly pork . 
  we can buy slices of `` terrines '' , which is the same but big . 
  why not solar ? 
  i do n't think that it will be a `` scandal '' in france . 
  horsemeat is great . 
  i do n't know . 
  the fun thing is that you still find blue cheese , but because of the high price it 's seen as a luxury delicacy . 
  the us government hates blue cheese , the us people i know love blue cheese . 
  the us government hurts its people . 
  i think they mean they will raise the tax on blue-cheese . 
  that 's what they do when they 're upset with french trade legislations . 
  / r/europecirclejerk /, 
  do you want to be a mod of europecirclejerk ? 
  i bet that 80 % of french people ignore what the cap is . 
  i really do n't think that this is the reason behind the results of the poll . 
  i really think that it 's more about a `` nationalist '' opinion but at the european level . 
  something like `` you like our community or you quit our community but stop bitching about it '' opinion . 
  if your question is : `` are the names of the pokemons the same everywhere ? 
  '' , the answer is no , each country has a different set of names . 
  for example , charmander ( eng ) = hitokage ( jp ) = salam\u00e8che ( fr ) . 
  i do n't say puttin ca n't do it . 
  and belgium has a king . 
  puttin is trolling , it 's not a request from depardieu . 
  and depardieu has already moved to belgium but you just do n't get an instant citizenship . 
  actually , every official paper ( forms but also official reports ) must use the french terms from the acad\u00e9mie . 
  contrary to what outsiders think , french rarely eat frog legs . 
  it 's too expensive . 
  we sometimes eat snails , but then again , it 's an expensive meal . 
  is [ welsh ] ( http://quelquejeu.pagesperso-orange.fr/chti/welsch.htm ) strange enough ? 
  it 's bread , beer and chedar in the oven . 
  or [ cazu marsu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7s95d_cct0&amp;noredirect=1 ) ... a cheese with worms . 
  because '' [ calimutcho ] ( http://www.1001cocktails.com/cocktails/1660/recette-cocktail-calimutcho-calimucho.html ) '' or '' [ tra\u00e7adinho ] ( http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/tra%c3%a7adinho ) '' or `` catembe '' . 
  europe already has surveyor drones . 
  these are armed drones .
