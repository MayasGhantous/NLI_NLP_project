  there are no toilets or you must pay for it . 
  the usual way is to go to a bar , pay for a drink , and use the restrooms . 
  ** france ** we hate paris . 
  people living in paris also love it , but dream of living out of paris . 
  i agree with the `` pity , tears and all of that '' . 
  our guide was faking tears . 
  it 's a performance ; he was faking tears 30 times a day . 
  there are tons of tourists and you queue like disneyland . 
  it was an awfull experience . 
  that was the penny drops to change how i plan a trip , and what i visit now . 
  it 's not . 
  `` putain '' is used as `` fuck '' in english . 
  `` oh crap it 's funny '' or `` oh it 's fucking funny '' would be the right translation . 
  to be fair , no military action is from one country alone now . 
  many european countries are helping . 
  transportation , drones , military satelites , evacuation ... 
  i eat snails something like twice a year . 
  i love snails but it 's an expensive meal and it 's not healthy . 
  my bet is that it 's not only france , but all countries that can export and be a threat for the exportations of the us . 
  i am french we have half of the things on this map . 
  without the baby boom ? 
  for example , look at the population in france before and after the wars : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_france#/media/file:population2centuries.jpg, 
  it sucks , but i do n't understand how these `` social workspots '' are the cause of people with phds folding boxes . 
  an american girl was working in my company for holidays . 
  she said that all europeans were looking gay ... 
  thanks texan girl ... edit : we know ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metrosexual, 
  what ?!, 
  `` monster raving looning party '' ? 
  it used to be the same in france until 1946 . 
  easy , the answer is then true, 
  his flag tell us he is an expert in rainology . 
  we can trust him . 
  because it 's fun with reddit : to talk shit about the songs , about the singers , about the french host speaking french , about the countries sending competitors to lose , about australia being european , about the hashtag syndrome , about the shitty comedic short movies ... 
  this article is quite interesting . 
  not about this particular case , but how drugs are tested . 
  '' * other laboratories had already abandoned efforts to develop this family of molecules ` due to ineffectiveness , ' * '' it 's not the first time i see stories about new inefficient drugs developped for business reasons only . 
  some well known drugs are efficient , but ca n't be sold with a high margin . 
  the drug makers need to invent new drugs to being able to increase their profits . 
  and water is wet . 
  canadian french sounds silly to us french people . 
  they have silly idioms . 
  we ca n't take them serioulsy , especially when they are angry and use silly words . 
  tell that to a qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois tabarnak . 
  france : soixante-dix , quatre-vingts , quatre-vingt-dix belgium : septante , quatre-vingts , nonante swiss : septante , huitante ( or octante ) , nonante, 
  they are better for lots of things . 
  beer . 
  chocolate . 
  `` french '' fries . 
  comic books . 
  being stupid . 
  then learn belgium french . 
  this is not how it works . 
  the way it works is that if the citizen has two nationalities , french and another one , the french one can be stripped . 
  i still think that this is a pretty useless law . 
  there are bomb alerts every month or week in france since september the 11th . 
  we will eat from 18pm to 1am . 
  we do n't eat `` tourti\u00e8res '' . 
  it 's a canadian recipe . 
  ( there is also a french desert but it 's not a well known one ), 
  my menu for christmas ( typical for a french ) : * snails ( that 's the only time of year we actually eat snails ) * oysters * duck liver ( foie gras ) * capon , stuffed with foie gras * cheeses , with salad * we will avoid the traditionnal '' [ b\u00fbche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yule_log_\\ ( cake \\ ) ) '' and have a `` soupe de fruits '' ( fruits in champagne ) * wines and champagne ( or similar to champagne but less expensive for the same result but without the name ), 
  yes , `` cl '' is frequently used when we speak about beverage . 
  25cl of beer , a soda can of 33cl , a bottle of wine of 75cl , 3cl of wisky ... these are standards ... ( we also have dedicated names for them , like a `` demi '' ), 
  you can buy good wine in france starting at 6 $ the 75cl bottle . 
  hmm ... netherlands ... netherlands ... which group ... 
  netherlands ? ... 
  the targets were `` sport , music and drinking '' . 
  we 'll never stop partying . 
  [ april ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/paris-student-planned-attack-church-france ) [ july ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/four-arrested-france-planning-terrorism-attacks ) [ september ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20150918-france-jihadist-arrested-terrorist-attack-plot-concert ) [ days ago ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20151110-france-foils-terrorism-attack-toulon-naval-base-jihad ) it 's just a very quick search , there may be other ones . 
  it 's a famous cartoon blog in france, 
  ladybugs maybe ? 
  are there tasty cute useful animals ? 
  whut ? 
  is n't it what we are doing already ? 
  i agree . 
  the problem is that we are used to get free news from the internet . 
  in my opinion , you ca n't get good journalistic work for free . 
  the corresponding french idiom seems to be '' * ce n'est plus ce que c ' \u00e9tait !, 
  * '' ( `` it is n't what it used to be ! '' ), 
  french like to say that french cars are n't reliable ( even if the statistics do n't agree ) . 
  what about a ds3 or a ds5 ? 
   why should the eu have to pay for it ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but the europe forbids countries to subsidize their own industries , to let all european industries to be competitive at the european level . 
  this could be the main reason why france has to push the subsidizes of farming at the european level . 
  [ here is an example ] ( http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=fr&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.euractiv.fr%2fagriculture%2ffruits-legumes-france-condamnee-16627.html ), 
  calm down everybody !, 
  :-) i think that this is just a cultural difference . 
  in france , you usually do n't go to a pub/bar to drink wine . 
  you usually drink beer or cocktails or soft drinks . 
  in france , if you go to a bar and ask for wine , you know that you risk to get low quality wine . 
  asking for a beer , you know what you 'll get . 
  there are special bars where there is wine only , and where you can taste pretty good wine with a plancha ( cheese and ham ) . 
  in other countries , it 's easier to get wine in bars . 
  it 's just a cultural difference and i must admit that i agree with cestcaquestbon : in france and in bars , wine is not a direct competitor with beer . 
  i 'm sure that the rise of the price of beer is not the main reason for this cultural change . 
  lots of things have changed in ten years . 
  mobile phones . 
  internet . 
  facebook . 
  let 's face it : we do n't need a meeting point any more , we can contact everybody at any time now , and planning a date has never been so easy . 
   the change will push up the price of a beer by about 20 % in bars and supermarkets this makes no sense .
