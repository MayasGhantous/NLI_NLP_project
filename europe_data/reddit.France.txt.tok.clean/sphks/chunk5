  the price of beer will rise of something like 13 cents per litre ( [ source ] ( http://www.toutsurlesimpots.com/taxe-sur-la-biere-le-mauvais-calcul-des-cafetiers.html ) ) . 
  the supermarkets will just add this tax to the price of the beer ( not 20 % ) . 
  but the bars will surely add 20 % ... 
  anyway , everything is already outrageously expensive in bars , from the 3-5 $ glass of mineral water to the 8-10 $ cocktail . 
  but you do n't pay for the beverage , you pay for the place and the service . 
  common ... 13 cents more per pint ( [ source ] ( http://www.toutsurlesimpots.com/taxe-sur-la-biere-le-mauvais-calcul-des-cafetiers.html ) ) it wo n't kill any business . 
  and because the tax is partially based on alcohol % , the main target is n't uk beer but belgium beer .

  the last sentence could be : `` impossible , we can afford it . '', 
   i know of plenty of erasmus students who failed courses at my university . 
  this says a lot about greek university and erasmus :-), 
  this is an interesting point . 
  you should propose to extend the study . 
  do we have this problem now ? 
  a lot of ancient text exist but we just do n't care or we already have the interesting pieces of information transcribed in another language we understand . 
  imho , it 's more interesting for everyone to understand everything now . 
  some of my friends ca n't read english ; they can only use 5 % of the internet . 
  on the other side ... cats . 
  cats . 
  animated gifs ... 
  how about invading monaco ? 
  it 's not about living in monaco . 
  it 's about having a house in monaco . 
  monaco . 
  i 'm french and i 'm so jealous . 
  i have n't been taught to drink fresh milk . 
  i 'll try it tomorrow . 
  the carlsberg museum ... free beers ...

  in guest star this year :-),

  to be fair , even merkel was confused, 
  [ sarkozy asked for it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=buy6exsnody#t=6s ) :-), 
  i agree . 
  it 's not a good thing ... 
  they plan not to : -10 % per minister . 
  they are adviced to use train and not plane . 
  is n't it how the 1929 crisis ended in the us ? 
  what is this spray ? 
  it 's worse than that !, 
  because the physical appearance is all what you should base your vote on . 
  as an example : she wants death penalty back . 
  i really like your vision . 
  it 's conceivable . 
  however , i ca n't see the current humans in this kind of society . 
  we are too selfish ... 
  if you consume less , wo n't you lower the average salary ? 
  and the variety of jobs ? 
  for example , would you value/pay for art or would it be your first financial cut ? 
  it 's a shame that most of people tend to choose the president on his charisma . 
  i 'm between bayrou and holland for their program . 
  i agree . 
  and his official twitter account is so funny it 's hard to tell which one is the parody . 
  i think esa is able to launch soyouz rockets from kourou . 
  and soyouz can take passengers onboard . 
  edit : sorry , i did n't read your question fully ... `` to the moon '' , not `` in space '' ... 
  i have no idea . 
  an option is [ eurolines ] ( http://www.eurolines.fr/en/ ) . 
  it 's a bus company between big cities in europe . 
  it 's very cheap . 
  the bus stops are usually in the centres of the cities , so you do n't have to worry about the `` final '' transport . 
  of course , it is not as fast and as comfortable than flying :-) you also can buy a [ pass ] ( http://www.eurolines.fr/en/other-products/eurolines-pass_1/ ) `` all you can travel '' for 15 or 30 days . 
  if you want something more comfortable and if you plan to travel a lot , you also have [ interrail ] ( http://www.interrailnet.com/ ) , a pass to take the train through europe . 
  i confirm . 
  brussels seems to match your profile and it is a great city . 
  do you think that this quote ca n't concern the country you are living in ? 
  the money can loose value compared to what you can buy with it . 
  imagine that you can buy one sandwich for 1 euro now , but in 5 years , the same sandwich costs 0,50 euros . 
  1.000.000 now < 990.000 in five years . 
  of course , it 's a bet , and you can loose . 
  driving to the workplace could be an issue at 70 ... 
  i ca n't see myself working 8 hours a day at 70 for any job . 
  just driving to the workplace could be an issue !, 
  i remember an idea ( not sure if already existing in some countries ) : having half time jobs for elderly people . 
  this maximum age is mostly for people not having worked enough ( or having worked abroad ) . 
  with this max , they can still have a decent live , without the necessity to do small jobs . 
  you still may work after , but you should have enough money not to have to . 
  currently in france , the tendancy is to reduce the public sector employee numbers . 
  you could find jobs within private school , especially `` cours du soir '' ( night lessons ? 
  ) , for older people wanting to improve their english after work . 
  you could also look for `` cours de soutient '' where students can improve their skill . 
  unless the goverment creates new rules to evaluate the unemployment rating , leading to smaller numbers ... like a few years ago . 
  can you explain ? 
  the french or the french government ? 
  latex is easy ... until you want to add figures and tables ( and tables with figures in it ! ) . 
  there is a step to understand how to manage them without being infuriated . 
  you ca n't really work with other people on one document with latex ( comments , history , etc. ) . 
  i know that you will say that you can , but most of people ca n't . 
  my personal experience is that when you open and save a . doc , it 's a total mess concerning the styles and the figures . 
  maybe , if you work only with . ods files , it 's ok . 
  i would watch this movie . 
  if he runs as an independant , he runs against his party by fragmenting it . 
  the winner of this operation would be the `` third man '' , like right extremists or centrists . 
  it 's just my opinion but i doubt that he will do such a thing . 
  his best option is to hope for the left to win , and to try to obtain a good job , like prime minister , in two or three years . 
  are you talking about dsk ? 
  because he will not run against his party ( left wing ) ; and the runner for this party has already been elected ( fran\u00e7ois hollande ) . 
  as a counter example , the idea of having easily available ( free ? 
  as in `` paid with taxes '' ? ),
