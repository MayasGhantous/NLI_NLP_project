  electricity and have referundums for everything ca n't work together in most of countries . 
  lots of people would vote against it . 
  there is no hatress in xenophobia . 
  xenophobia is the fear of foreigners ( fear of other cultures ) . 
  this fear is present in what you call `` ethnic nationalism '' : you fear that your culture may disappear/lose its purity/lose its territorial suppremacy if foreigners come in mass . 
  so , in my opinion , this is not `` completly different '' as you wrote . 
  it is subtely different . 
  ethnic nationalism could not exist without xenophobia . 
  i am interested in your words . 
  what is the difference between ethnic nationalism and xenophobia ? 
  you say they are completly different . 
  i really love the sea maps with trails of deep measurements ( like in the harbour of genoa in this map ) . 
  you can imagine a small boat , a sinker and a string ... 
  most of the old questions where on life , universe , creation . 
  two thirds of the new questions are on masturbation , weapons , destruction . 
  it 's like having my 12yo bully asking questions . 
  i am a bit disappointed with the new kind of questions on r/askscience . 
  it is a subjective opinion . 
  unless this is [ this kind of question ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lytha/how_come_we_cant_tickle_ourselves_but_we_can/ ) . 
  please do n't . 
  can we joke on disabled people ? 
  you can joke on everything but not with anybody . 
  their ideas are fine , their acts are not, 
  ( and maybe nigeria do n't want them either ), 
  if you are a fanatic , you ca n't `` think twice '' . 
  if you give your life to kill others ( not in this event but you got the idea ) , the punishement of being deported is laughable . 
  what you could have is a psychology support . 
  not a law enforcement support . 
  maybe because they are born in france ? 
  maybe they are born in france . 
  this would be a tough work . 
  you ca n't brainwash a fanatic in one week .

  the `` futuroscope '' is retro-futurism on video ( 80 's 90 's ) . 
  it used to be really impressive video and sound systems but it is now `` retro '' compared to current systems . 
  imagine toys story 1 3d imaging , cathodic screens , etc. 
  expect to have retro-futurism things and you can have a great geeky time . 
  in paris ( north-est ) you have the `` cit\u00e9e de la science '' . 
  this is a quite big museum on science . 
  it 's more a state of the art of the 1900 's - 1950 's technologies ( mecanisms , motors , gears , etc. ), 
  a solution is : 1 . 
  working in a company targetting cheap products . 
  after a few years , trying to be employed by a concurrent , targetting goog quality, 
  very interesting . 
  i already saw this situation in france too . 
  the ironic issue is that the education is too good and the technologies/methods are renewed quite fast . 
  if the quality of the product is not your priority , unexperienced students can replace experienced people for lots of tasks .

  strikes as a usual thing . 
  here is a website with an agenda of [ the current strikes in france ] ( http://www.cestlagreve.fr/ ) . 
   let them live with us in our bathtubs i so want it to be a thing !, 
  in france it 's the volume of own consumption : - 10 liters of spirit ( rhum ... ) - 20 liters of vermout ans similar - 90 liters of wine - 110 liters of beer per person . 
  it means that you can have 120 liters of wine in your car if you are two adults . 
  it 's quite common in burgundy . 
  mostly because tourists ask for it ( foreign tourists , but also french tourists visiting burgundy ), 
  maybe the charles-de-gaulle carrier .

  we have them in france . 
  there 's barely only one brand making them . 
  so we call them from this brand ( twinuts ), 
  an american texan girl staying for 6 months in my company for a work experience . 
  she was criticizing e-ve-ry-thing . 
  france and europe in general . 
  '' - the food is disgusting '' '' - what ? 
  vegetables ? 
  you mean green things ? 
  how are you supposed to eat that ? '', 
  '' - europeans with messenger bags are all homosexuals . 
  it 's a true fact . '', 
  '' - homosexuality is not natural . 
  it 's like this you ca n't debate . '', 
  '' - you are dumb with your ecology rules . '', 
  '' - i used the washing machine for one pair of jeans and my host has made a remark about it . 
  what a dumb ecological bitch . '', 
  '' - people here are so dumb with their bicycle . '', 
  for 6 months .

  a speach under a really heavy rain :  '' * gouverner c'est pleuvoir . 
   `` to govern is to rain . 
  from this point of view , we are reaching our goal better than we could have wished '' . 
  the original quote is '' * gouverner c'est pr\u00e9voir * '' / `` to govern is to anticipate '' ( emile de girardin , journalist and politician from the xixe ) . 
  there is a pun '' * pleuvoir/pr \u00e9voir * '' , `` to rain/to anticipate '' . 
  there is a pun , but you need to be knowledgeable to understand it . 
  it 's a wit . 
  highjacking the first comment to `` promote '' a related ( dead ) subreddit : / r/strangehumans /, 
  i think that this situation comes from the `` primaires '' ( unofficial primary open elections organised by moderate parties ) . 
  this leads to a far right leader ( fillon ) for the moderate right party and a far left leader ( hamon ) for the moderate left party . 
  the right leader ( fillon ) has been caught paying his family with fake jobs . 
  the left leader ( hamon ) has no charisma . 
  as a result the polls are now keeping : - `` announced '' far right ( le pen ) . 
  anti-migrants . 
  anti-euro . 
  - centrist/social liberal ( macron ) . 
  like the current government . 
  - `` announced '' far left ( m\u00e9lenchon ) that has a really big charisma .
