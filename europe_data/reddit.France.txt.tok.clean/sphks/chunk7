  note : moderate right ( fillon ) has still the same score as m\u00e9lenchon . 
  his line is `` reducing the debt , by firing 500000 public workers , and privatizing healthcare system '' . 
  note 2 : the polls ca n't be trusted . 
  in french , other specific subreddits are starting to merge . 
  like / r/besoindeparler , / r/pasdequestionidiote , etc. 
  once , i ate a pizza with snails on it . 
  ( france of course ) . 
  `` cordon bleu '' in france is a milanese scallop ... but it 's a lowcost industrial thing . 
  it 's like a giant nugget filled with lowcost cheese .

  it 's splendid to go for tourism , but it 's often boring and expensive to stay there to live . 
  i went on l'\u00eele de la r\u00e9union once . 
  it was my best trip ever . 
  it 's perfect if you like hiking . 
  scuba diving , roller skating , skimboarding , bicycle , walking ( in france , we love to just walk outside . 
  every weekend it 's usual to just go for a walk with another family , with the kids , in a forest , in a small town , along a river , between fields ... ) . 
  next summer i would like to try to ride a stand up paddle . 
  scuba diving is a good compromise between being on your own and interacting with people . 
  it 's one of the rare sports that you play on cooperative . 
  yes of course . 
  thanks, 
  oysters , foie gras ( duck liver ) , good wine .

  [ pizza ] ( http://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2016/03/09/the-french-are-worlds-biggest-pizza-consumers/ ), 
  in france it 's served with mashed potatoes , onions and sauted apples . 
  it 's grilled cheese poored on potatoes with ham , and what you want : dry sausage , cured ham , pickles , salad , fresh mushrooms , and other shits .

  french people have the [ galette des rois ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_cake ) . 
  it 's still a really really big tradition . 
  now that i think about it , it 's funny that it 's just mostly a french thing . 
  you should ask * how often do strikes not occur in your country * . 
  there are currently at least ~ ~ three ~ ~ ~ ~ four ~ ~ many strikes right now [ one concerning a private tv channel ] ( https://www.franceculture.fr/medias/la-greve-itele-est-inedite-dans-lhistoire-de-laudiovisuel-francais ) , [ one from the security workers ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/greve/greve-les-vigiles-denoncent-leurs-conditions-de-travail_1901387.html ) , [ one from maids ] ( http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/provence-alpes/bouches-du-rhone/metropole-aix-marseille/marseille/marseille-greve-femmes-menage-hotel-luxe-1120037.html ) , [ one concerning regional trains ] ( http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/auvergne/puy-de-dome/artense/clermont-ferrand/auvergne-trafic-ter-perturbe-greve-1121157.html ) ...

  `` croque-monsieur '' ( also called `` croque '' ) is simpler that `` toasted sandwich with ham and cheese '' to me, 
  the complete recipe includes b\u00e9chamel sauce . 
  i need pumpkin seed oil now ... edit : it looks like it 's nearly impossible to buy that in france . 
  a `` galette '' is a basically a buckwheat `` cr\u00eape '' . 
  you can put any ingredient in it . 
  the picture here is the most well known composition : a `` galette compl\u00eate '' ( full ) - ham , egg and emmental . 
  [ here is a random recipe ] ( http://www.foodnetwork.ca/recipe/galette-bretonne-au-sarrasin/6258/ ) but do n't use oil - ever . 
  use salted butter . 
  tons of salted butter . 
  that 's how it is crispy and flavorful . 
  `` sorry , no cash , no cards .

  bus in italy, 
  * engrenages * . 
  it 's about the work of police officers , judges , lawyers ... 
  it 's pretty realistic . 
  it 's a comedy . 
  it 's about the life of two really different caricatural families . 
  one is the caricatural family from the right political party ( rich , religious ... ) and the other is the caricatural family from the left political party ( difficulties to find a job , ecology ... ), 
  [ mouk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwjygrwacey ) it 's a little bear ( mouk ) and his cat friend ( chavapa ) that are going around the world with their bike . 
  the drawings are beautiful . 
  the music is great . 
  the stories are great - it 's not about fighting each other . 
  the pace is normal - it 's not ultra-speed . 
  and it makes the kids discover about living in the countries all around the world . 
  it was 118 in swiss too . 
  it looks like it 's a european wide flop . 
  in france , the `` 118 xxx '' . 
  prior to 2006 , there was a public service , the number `` 12 '' . 
  you could call them and ask for the phone number of someone . 
  it was like a phone book . 
  in 2006 , this public service has been replaced by private companies , using a number starting with 118 . 
  118000 , 118218 , etc. 
  it looks like there was a dream from these private companies to be the successor of the 12 . 
  and there was 33 of them . 
  33 companies with the same service . 
  this is insane . 
  so they all made tons of advertisement everwhere , on the tv , on bus , on the radio , every-fucking-where for a year . 
  the thing is , with internet providing such service for free , mobile phones becoming a personnal phone book , and mobile phones ' numbers not being in phone-books anymore , nobody were using this service anymore . 
  this was a really big flop . 
  also : a little too paris-centered . 
  but that 's like anything in france . 
  weather , pollution , tv-info , tv-series , fiction-films ... everything is a little too paris-centered . 
  `` melun '' is the stereotypical bad city in france . 
  this is due to famous french humorists making jokes about it : fernand raynaud , pierre palmade , chevallier et laspal\u00e8s , franck dubosc ... 
  in 2008 there was [ a meme on facebook about melun being a boring city ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/seine-et-marne/melun-ville-la-moins-sexy-de-france-15-01-2008-3295976604.php ) more recently , bergues in the north of france is also known as the stereotypical bad place to live because of the film `` bienvenue chez les ch ` tits '' . 
  ( also `` bergues '' sounds like `` berk '' which is the sound you make when you do n't like something ), 
  it 's salty liquorice from nordic countries and it 's forbidden to sell it in france . 
  :-( it 's actually quite dangerous for the blood pressure and for the heart and that 's why it 's forbidden . 
  what 's in it ? 
  and snails . 
  duck liver . 
  frog legs are pretty easy to buy anywhere . 
  just look for a `` picard '' shop ( frozen food ) . 
  you can find frogs legs in some in fancy expensive parisian restaurants . 
  about the region , it 's from around lyon . 
  ( where snails are obviously from burgundy ), 
  accurate : - we buy our baguette every day or so - we drink wine , we eat moldy cheese , dry sausage ... - always on strike inaccurate : - mimes : it 's because the most famous mime is french , but we do n't like mimes . 
  i 've never ever seen a mime in my life . 
  - not clean : common ... it comes from kings ' era ... - eating snails and frogs : snails : maybe once a year . 
  frogs : never . 
  - rude people : i do n't think it 's true . 
  rude waiters in paris : that 's accurate , especially compared to american waiters where they are paid with tips . 
  since england was playing against iceland days after the referendum for the euro 2016 football competition , the joke was `` who will play against iceland ? '',
