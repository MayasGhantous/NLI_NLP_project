  1st law of thermodynamics . 
  for the past 5 or 10 years , there have been changes concerning the parks in france . 
  the municipalities tends to be more ecological : no more pesticides , less mowing , less triming , avoid watering ... 
  the idea is to spend less resources ( work or natural resources ) . 
  this leads to parks being `` rougher '' , more `` natural '' . 
  if you want to see beautiful law , go see `` jardins '' . 
  usually , you need to pay to see them . 
  what you call `` cheese '' but is not cheese for us . 
  just coagulated milk . 
  what we call cheese is a complex process of drying and fermentation . 
  in france : `` free '' but it 's limited to 35 days of free roaming from lots of european countries . 
  16 $ / month ( or 20 $ if no adsl with them ) , unlimited calls , unlimited sms , 50go of data ... 
  i do n't 100 % agree . 
  i subscribed to this subreddit to get interesting questions about european countries , to learn about europe . 
  this is an interesting question and i would love to read answers . 
  not really . 
  we are still allowed to protest . 
  some people are just pillaging in my city and i do n't mind if they are obligated to stay at home . 
  there is no torture nor unexpected jail time . 
  the police is doing a good job and they have a big pressure on them . 
  they are currently on strike because of this pressure . 
  in france , marmiton is the most famous , but i prefer `` chef simon '' for the quality of the recipies . 
  it 's available everywhere in france . 
  you just have to go in a darty/boulanger to know the brand http://www.darty.com/nav/recherche?text=de+dietrich&amp;srctype=auto, 
  it 's a french company !? 
  til . 
  ( of course it 's well known in france ), 
  kellogg 's is well known in europe . 
  unreliable source : 7700 employes in europe , amongst 32000 total . 
  there are now two parks . 
  disneyland and walt disney studios . 
  you definitely need two days , one for each . 
  you need two entrances , one for each park . 
  if you plan to go out , the nearby city is not that great ( marne la vall\u00e9e ) . 
  you can take the rer ( train ) to go to paris . 
  it 's 7 $ 50 for a 45min ride to the center of paris . 
  there 's one train every 15 minutes . 
  where in france ? 
  there are tons of micro breweries with good beer in france . 
  most of [ houses in europe are made of rock/concrete blocks/mud , compared to wood in the usa ] ( http://masonrydesign.blogspot.fr/2014/01/european-construction-versus-north.html ) . 
  the thermal inertia of concrete/rock/mud is really high . 
  also , they are designed with small windows . 
  european houses tend to be dark and fresh during summer . 
  note 1 : in the nordic countries , they use wood but summer is never hot . 
  note 2 : new european houses tend to use wood and big windows . 
  note 3 : in the south of europe ( italy , greece ... ) where it 's really hot in summer , we use ac , especially in `` modern '' buildings (  1950 ) that are not designed to be fresh . 
  do n't be silly . 
  in france we all have a really big kitchen with apprentice chefs like in ratatouille and we only eat complex recipes . 
  malabar . 
  a french origin bubblegum with a muscular man as an icon . 
  there were comic strips around each gum . 
  then tatoos . 
  they were famous . 
  but the brand has been bought and the muscular man has been replaced by an infamous cat . 
  hollywood chewingum . 
  a post ww2 brand . 
  made by an american fighter in france . 
  paris, 
  no , we do n't , it 's just a joke . 
  we see it as a part of france . 
  it 's a joke related to a recent event . 
  in the begining of 2016 , there were elections for the presidents of regions . 
  the new president of region corsica is a separatist . 
  the first thing he said was trolling the gouvernement , saying that [ france is a friendly country to corsica . 
  ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1768247-20160118-corse-talamoni-france-pays-ami ) it may be stupid but most people see it as a full part of france only because when there is a map of the weather , corsica is on it . 
  on the other side , dom/tom are not on this map and are often forgotten by people . 
  i was on vacation on one of these islands and people from the `` main '' part of france were saying `` in france '' when speaking about were they live , even if they were actually in france . 
  outdoor markets are unusual for an american . 
  once or twice a week , in cities , mobile shops are all going on a place . 
  the day of the week depends of the city . 
  you can found really good food there , but it 's expensive . 
  you can go there just to take some pictures and for the smell . 
  country-side markets are the best because you can find local food producers . 
  nice try salah abdeslam . 
  there are tasty food that you will never find in the us : old cheese that stinks ( blue cheese , raw milk camembert , mimolette extra vieille ... ) . 
  be careful where to buy it . 
  in supermarkets , there are tons of tasteless cheese . 
  in some big supermarkets , there are good cheeses . 
  blue cheese should be `` roquefort '' and can be eaten with butter or pear , because the taste is very strong . 
  camembert should be `` camembert de normandie '' and not `` camembert fabriqu\u00e9 en normandie '' . 
  mimolette should be `` extra vieille '' . 
  comt\u00e9 should be old , ex 24 months old . 
  of course you need baguette ( `` tradition '' ) and wine to go with it . 
  i have seen a french flag tis week , it was half mast all the week . 
  these restaurants may be in touristic places so they can be jerks . 
  they ca n't refuse you free water and bread . 
  sometimes they try to trick you , especially if you are a foreigner , or in expensive restaurants . 
  they ask you if you want still of flat water , if you do n't say `` no bottle , tap water '' they bring you a bottle . 
  select any three places and stay there for 1 week and a half . 
  do some activities like hiking , kayak , geocaching , meet the people , go to the supermarket , buy quality food , invite your neighbours for a brunch/ap \u00e9ro / tea time ... people always want to see too much in europe and as a result they see nothing of the actual europe . 
  they see relics like the chateau de versailles or the parthenon , but that 's not how we live . 
  europe is `` buraczki z chrzanem '' , `` turkish coffee in greece '' , `` kayak in the verdon gorge '' , `` a quizz game in a pub in england '' , `` fireworks in copenhagen december the 31th '' , etc. 
  beautiful scenery + historical site = dordogne ( france ) . 
  it 's a well known place for prehistoric relics . 
  sarlat is a medieval city . 
  also : foie-gras , montbazillac wine ... 
  it 's also a great place for hitchhiking and kayak . 
  nestl\u00e9 products ? 
  just avoid the `` diagonale du vide '' http://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/diagonale_du_vide, 
  from paris , you basically can go in every big city ( in france or elsewhere ) by train or by plane .
