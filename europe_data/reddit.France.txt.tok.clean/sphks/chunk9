  it is really hard to reach any great beach if you do n't rent a car . 
  an idea amongst others : get the plane from paris to palermo , then the bus to mondello ( north of palermo ) . 
  you may look for an island instead of a city . 
  what about `` l'\u00eele d'ol\u00e9ron '' ? 
  both have a bridge to join them . 
  you just need to rent a bike once there . 
  [ also , small villages are pretty ] ( http://www.les-plus-beaux-villages-de-france.org/fr/carte-des-plus-beaux-villages-de-france ) . 
  but there is not much to do but hiking , city-wandering and eating . 
  concerning cities with an history and plenty of things to do , basically any big city after paris ... lyon , lille , rennes , strasbourg , bordeaux , toulouse , lyon , marseilles , laval , nice , lyon ... 
  concerning `` english-friendly '' , i think that you can go anywhere and do n't be afraid about it . 
  of course there may be small villages where you will be lost , but most of the french people will try to help you . 
  where are you ? 
  where are you from ? 
  the bank-specific atm is what i would go for . 
  across europe , you can use any atm of any bank ( there may be exceptions ) . 
  also , with many atm , you start by choosing the language , and you can choose english , so it 's easy to use . 
  the fee depends on your bank , not on the bank of the atm . 
  so , you can use any atm of any bank . 
  sometimes it 's better to withdraw a lot of money because you can have a fixed fee ( + a percentage fee ) . 
  the `` foreign currency atm '' in an airport seems fishy :-) i do n't know what it is . 
  maybe it 's to get money in another currency than the one of the country you are in ( with a crazy fee ) . 
  bread really ? 
  we also think that our bread is the best . 
  how many are you ? 
  is it imaginable to rent a car ? 
  it 's the best way to discover the country side . 
  also , it is not necessary more expensive than train because you could eat and sleep in small cities , where it 's way cheaper . 
  also , you have to avoid `` autoroutes '' , that are expensive , it 's better to go accross the small cities . 
  are you students ? 
  concerning the hotels , you can look for cheap ones like `` formule 1 '' or equivalent . 
  they are usually on the outside of big to medium cities ( accessible by car only ) . 
  it can be like 30 $ per night for 3 persons . 
  you will spend more time in transportation that actually spending time is cities . 
  rome is big . 
  you can find lots of pizzerias , good or bad . 
  you can easily find the good ones : the restaurant is full and there is a one hour long queue in front of it :-) if you want to see the country-side , you can take the subway to a big bus-station near a terminus . 
  there are lots of buses that goes to the nearby cities for a dirt cheap price . 
  for the buses inside rome , you ca n't buy bus-tickets in the buses . 
  be sure to buy tickets in the big red machines before !, 
  ( a one-week pass or equivalent ), 
  the issue is that the great cities for shopping do n't have the best beaches . 
  the best beaches are usually 10-20 km from the big cities . 
  do you plan to rent a car ? 
  in the french alps , there are two kinds of wild camping : `` bivouac '' and `` camping '' . 
  to simplify , `` bivouac '' ( camping one night on the same spot ) is authorised and `` camping '' ( multiple nights on the same spot and during the days ) is forbidden . 
  strasbourg ( france ), 
  cheap food . 
  cheap good vodka . 
  butter spray, 
  yes it works properly , there are very few injured people . 
  we do n't complain because we do n't know `` better '' ( if we can say that anarchy is better :-) ) . 
  also cities have plenty of money compared to individual people , so we have [ big fireworks for 15-30minutes synchronised with music and lights ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=veopu7mu8i0#t=2016 ) edit : [ this one is great ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5hqput353o ), 
  like kelim said : everything is pretty expensive in denmark . 
  i was surprised by the price of food and booze ( more expensive than france ) . 
  there are official fireworks , organised by the cities , with the fire departement ready . 
  but you ca n't easily buy a lot of fireworks and play with them . 
  first they are pretty expensive compared to denmark ( smaller production ) . 
  then you just ca n't buy big fireworks , only small things not too dangerous . 
  this has not always been the case . 
  i remember , about 30 years ago , that was crazy ( but maybe not as crazy as in nordic countries ) . 
  [ for the crazy newyear 's fireworks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3eqoxmk85c ), 
  - we are rude with strangers when abroad ( `` everything is better in france '' , etc. ) . 
  but i think that this disapear with then new generation , being more pro-european and open-minded . 
  - the public institutions are frequently on strike , sometimes for good reasons , sometimes they do n't know why . 
  i ca n't generalise for all french but : - i usually find / r/foodporn / and / r/cakewin / disgusting . 
  i love fruits and vegetables , not grease and sugar . 
  i love stinky cheese with moisture , meat that is off , organic chicken , something that you will not find in a us kitchen . 
  actually , i do n't mind spending a lot on these things and less on electronic gadgets , fuel , having a big house ... we eat wayyyy less peanuts . 
  if we go the the restaurant , we expect to eat well . 
  - wooden houses is quite new to us . 
  we have smaller houses but made in concrete or rocks . 
  - we are less `` all black or all white '' than the americans . 
  it 's okay for us not to have a strong opinion on everything . 
  - religion is marginalised . 
  sometimes it resurrects like for the gay marriage . 
  - we avoid to take the car if possible , because in big cities it 's usually a mess . 
  - we have strong consummer protections - we do n't have a lawyer - we produce a lot of films , there are incentives for it . 
  our films are more about actual people , and less about heroes . 
  because [ listening to metal music and being smart is correlated ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/mar/21/whymetalfansarebrainier ) . 
  ( i hate metal music , i 'm not in the smartest . ), 
  i do n't know about venice , but the `` romantic '' places in paris and florence are overcrowded . 
  it 's just my personnal opinion , but i would say a small city near the mediteranean sea . 
  avoid the biggest ones . 
  it 's just a personal opinion , but the travel that you planed accross europe seems really long . 
  you will mostly travel ( by train ) and you will see barely nothing from europe . 
  also , because you will use trains , you will go from big touristic cities to other big touristic cities . 
  you definitely need to dedicate some days to try to go out of these big cities ( by bus , or with really small trains , or by hitchhiking ) . 
  it 's difficult , but this is how you could discover cultures . 
  being lost is great . 
  this is the way to go . 
  however , it can be hard to see the country side . 
  you will only visit expensive cities concerning food and hotels . 
  you should look for [ hostels ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hostel ) , it 's very cheap and are in big cities ( the ones with train stations ) . 
  there is no miracle , it 's hard to see the country side without a car . 
  i just tried it , it seems that the price is a little more expensive via this website ( ~ 4 dollars per train ticket ) than using the companies ' websites . 
  the german train company ( [ deutsche bahn ] ( http://www.bahn.com/i/view/gbr/en/ ) ) allows you to plan your trip from any country to any country . 
  actually , you always pay for the plastic bags a way or the other . 
  in your case , in the price of your groceries . 
  this is just an incentive to use less one-use plastic bags and more reusable ones . 
  i wanted to post this .
