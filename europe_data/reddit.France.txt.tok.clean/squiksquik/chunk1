** france ** ** politics ** * ^ someone ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ sarkozy ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shut ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ up ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ please * french hostage herv\u00e9 gourdel was beheaded in algeria by jihadists from daech . 
  events are and have been organized to honour the victim 's memory and denounce the terrorist organization 's actions , some of them by french muslims decided to show that they absolutely do n't support daech 's actions . 
  * half the senate was to be renewed today . 
  it appears that the left have lost their majority ( but the fact that they had in the first place was already nothing short of a miracle ) . 
  the fn also gained his first 2 senators , one of them the youngest senator of the ve republic at 26 years old . 
  * a new political party appears !, 
  it 's the front d\u00e9mocrate , a center-left splinter from the centrist mouvement d\u00e9mocrate ( modem ) . 
  ** economy ** * air france 's biggest pilots union announced today that they would stop their strike . 
  negociations are still in progress . 
  * unemployment dropped a little this month , but many think that it 's more of case of + radiations and seasonal work than anything else . 
   the new minister of the economy described workers at a certain factory as `` illiterate '' [ 10 ] . 
  people are already suspicious of his `` finance '' background . 
  not exactly a great way to start winning them back ... well , it was true . 
  he certainly could have said it better though . 
  i know a lot of people who do n't want him back either . 
  many are also very afraid of ending up with a sarkozy/le pen duel for the second turn in 2017 :( as for your question , well , it would seems so . 
  the right tends to be `` all behind one man '' , too , which certainly does n't help competition . 
  politicians from the ump are already turning their backs on the people they supported after sarkozy 's failure and departure , like fran\u00e7ois fillon ( arguably one of the less worse choices if we 're talking about honesty ) . 
  personnally , i hope that sarkozy will end up in jail or deprived of his civic rights before the election because of one of his numerous affairs . 
  it 's kind of a race against the clock . 
  ah , well . 
  there are still 2-3 years to go , many things can still happen until then . 
  ** economy ** * michel sapin ( finance minister ) announced that france was going to [ miss its deficit target ; also lowered growth projections ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29141416 ) . 
  in other news , nobody is really surprised . 
  ** politics ** * [ nicolas sarkozy has announced that he will be candidate to become the new president of the ump ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/nicolas-sarkozy-les-coulisses-de-son-retour-12-09-2014-4128477.php ) , which he wants to `` change '' ( change the name , change the bureau , change the image ... change everything , who said like they did with the rpr that became ump ? ) . 
  nobody is doubting that he also wants to be a candidate in the next presidential elections . 
  some are comparing him to berlusconi in a `` he needs to win if he does n't want to go to jail '' way . 
  she has repeatedly said that she wanted to offer her ideas to the prime minister , and criticized the government 's chosen way ( too much to the right for her , and , admittedly , many socialist sympathizers ) . 
  she has been minister of labor and minister of labor and solidarity in the past , notably one of the architects of the 35h workweek , and is more on the left of the socialist party . 
  at least one socialist deputy has already said that he wo n't vote `` yes '' , while the `` frondeurs '' ( deputies who are not satisfied with the government politics , which they find to be too much to the right ) will probably abstain . 
  the trust is a matter of tradition rather than obligation , but the consequences of a failure on the 16th are still unclear . 
  * pierre moscovici , the previous finance minister , [ has been nominated to a key portfolio ( eu economics policy ) of the european commission ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29139503 ) . 
  reactions have been mixed .

  * thomas thevenoud , secretary of external trade , has been resigned from his post in the governement after the fact that he had n't been paying his taxes for the last three years was discovered by the ( all new and apparently useful ) high autority for transparency in public life ( who would have thought ) . 
  since , we also learnt that he did n't like to pay his rent either , among several other things . 
  another issue : [ people who have resigned from the governement may eventually return to their post of deputy , which he has done , when pretty much everyone wants him gone ] ( http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/pour-cambadelis-thomas-thevenoud-demissionnera-de-son-siege-de-depute-12-09-2014-4129761.php ) .

  it 's an issue of image for the `` we 're not corrupted like the others '' front national , which had the same problems with its mayors in 1995 . 
  * new reports and investigations seem to accredit the fact that the settlement of 405m $ granted in june 2008 to bernard tapie was the result of , basically , [ cooked books and * understandings * between friends ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/09/11/tapie-n-a-pas-ete-lese-dans-la-vente-d-adidas-en-1993_4485812_3224.html ) .

   defending yourself against black people in detroit should never give you any prison time . 
   well black people can \u00b4 t. 
  tell me one place on earth where blacks are in a majority that are a good place . 
  it doesn \u00b4 t exist . 
  if thats racist then so be it , its simple facts . 
   correction : muslims can never be thought of as human beings . 
  they are a cancer on humanity . 
  thank you for the gold . 
  given its content , i do n't think / r/european should be in that selection . 
  if you thought you were going to read anything else than xenophobic shit in the comments , you thought wrong ; the stormfront & friends brigading is strong in this one .
