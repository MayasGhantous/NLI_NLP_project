  when brown , let the cubes cool before adding the cream . 
  break the eggs in a bowl then beat them . 
  add salt and pepper as you see fit . 
  pour the beaten eggs in a buttered pan . 
  when the omelet is done , drop it off on an long plate . 
  garnish the center of the omelet with the apple cubes . 
  fold the edges . 
  sprinkle icing sugar . 
  flame the omelet with the calvados . 
  serve immediately . 
  i 'm not familiar * at all * with the english cooking vocabulary . 
  i hope it 's still understandable . 
  [ original recipe ( french ) ] ( http://www.normandie-heritage.com/spip.php?article358 ), 
  hollande is doing many things . 
  are people happy with what he 's doing ? 
  that 's another thing entirely , but he 's doing things . 
  and clearly an improvement from sarkozy and his clique , though that was n't really hard , eh . 
  hollande , a left-wing * fanatic * ? 
  i need the number of your drug dealer , his stuff is clearly awesome . 
  it 's different , i 'd say . 
  as for the variety , i 'm not that well versed in german bread , so i 've no idea . 
  all i know is that bread is probably * the * thing pretty much all french eat on a regular basis :p, 
  ` nuff said . 
  yep ; many also think that we should n't have to fund the `` first something '' pet projects at all . 
  the downvotes in this thread make me wonder if / r/europe is being raided ( it 's not paranoia if it 's true !, 
  if i remember correctly , it was a friend 's web agency or something like that . 
  and yes , [ how the fuck ] ( http://www.carlabrunisarkozy.org/ ) indeed . 
  ** france ** * nothing to see here , let us die in peace , be it crushed by the heat or thunderstruck during a storm . 
  * well , almost . 
  our national swim team apparently went totally under during the world championship . 
  * and our embassy is yemen is going to be closed some time in august because of terrorist threats . 
  * and three men were freed because there were n't enough room in jail . 
  cue heavy critics from the right on the `` laxist left '' . 
  * a new important element in the karachi scandal appears !, 
  our judges do n't seem too keen on taking vacations , it seems . 
  * carla bruni-sarkozy 's website costed the taxpayers around 400.000 $ . 
  people are angry . 
  * the ump ( the big right party ) is still asking for donations after the rejection of sarkozy 's presidential campaign accounts by the constitutional council some time ago . 
  * the members of the far-right movement `` g\u00e9n\u00e9ration identitaire '' who got on the roof of the socialist party 's hq to display a banner said to the judge that they went there `` by chance '' . 
  he was n't impressed . 
  * dsk is going to work in eastern europe . 
  maybe . 
  on another note , much news about foreign countries were had . 
  france * dominique strauss-khan is not out of the woods yet . 
  * the senate has voted the transparency law ... this time ; and even added a few nice changes . 
  we 'll have to see what the assembly makes of that . 
  * it 's freaking * hot * , and when it is n't , there 're storms . 
  * all in all , i think it was a pretty slow week for us . 
  news were more focused on what 's happening abroad . 
  damn it , politicians !, 
  they 're insufferable . 
  this tradition seems really , really nice . 
  i wish we had it in france , maybe our politicians would be less prone to systematic opposition , 
  do n't forget all the drama around the election of our newly chosen assembly member !, 
  ( socialist candidate kicked out in the first round with a second round taking place between a right ( ump ) and , more importantly , a far-right ( fn ) candidate ) . 
  brazil was also talked about quite a bit , i think . 
  i agree , it 's also worth all the nom nom with cheese . 
  :d you should check out [ gratin savoyard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gratin_savoyard#gratin_savoyard ) for more potatoes + cheese goodness !, 
  basically potatoes + cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche . 
  om nom nom nom . 
  i had to do a double-take on your first two . 
  what the hell o_o, 
  i guessed that you were still studying french , since you used `` depuis '' ; if it 's indeed the case , you ca n't use pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 here because it 's for past actions , and only actions which have been `` finished '' . 
  there are some tricky occurences , but it 's mostly that : * `` j'ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le fran\u00e7ais pendant deux ans '' ( i 've studied french for two years ) =  you 're not studying french anymore , but you did for two years at a point in the past =  pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 * `` j'\u00e9tudie le fran\u00e7ais depuis deux ans '' ( i 've been studying french for two years ) =  you 're studying french now =  pr\u00e9sent it may also be used like this : * `` j'ai toujours aim\u00e9 le chocolat '' ( i 've always loved chocolate ) =  the action is not finished per se , because , for all we know , you 're still going to love chocolate tomorrow , but pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used here because the action is framed in a finished timespace ( `` always '' ( before ) to `` now '' ) . 
  * `` longtemps , j' ai aim\u00e9 l'odeur du pain frais '' ( i loved the smell of fresh bread for a long time ) =  you loved the smell for a long time of your life =  finished timespace . 
  i hope it helps . 
  if i may help you : `` qu'il est une jolie langue '' would actually be `` que c'est [ une jolie langue ] '' . 
  damn , it 's actually pretty hard to explain . 
  basically , when to choose * ce * / * c ' * or * il/elle * : * * il/elle * refer to a specific person/it 's direct . 
  * * c/ce * do n't / it 's indirect . 
  ( it 's unbelievable !, 
  ) ; `` ce sont de jolies chaussures '' ( these are pretty shoes ) . 
  it can be very tricky . 
  i hope i 've remembered well !, 
  and beware , pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 hijacked your first verb !, 
  when i see the assembly ( france ) , i sometimes want to kick them in the back of the head ; when they `` boooo '' the person currently talking ( almost always someone of another party , of course ) , for example . 
  i really find this kind of behavior childish , and unbecoming of an elected official . 
  merci beaucoup !, 
  france ( currently ) : * unemployment , financial/social issues , economy * baccalaur\u00e9at ( end of high school exam , always a big deal ) * political scandals : cahuzac , sarkozy , gu\u00e9ant , lagarde , i 'm sure i 've forgotten some ... it seems justice has kicked it up a notch since a year ago ( it 's nice ! ), 
  * people stabbing each other in the back : barroso for the country , ump boys and girls for sarkozy , eelv ( greens ) for the socialist party * law about `` the moralization of public life '' in the assembly ( officials , their assets , etc. ), 
  * international politics : g8 , turkey , we 're starting to hear about brazil too . 
  yup , lot of stabbing these days . 
  as for the rest -- there have been very polarizing issues and rhetoric used these last few years ( during the gay marriage thing , for example ) , so i think shouting and losing friends could , sadly , happen these days . 
  so it 's gotten to the point where you make memes of dead children . 
  what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  no , they still are firmly far right , even if they try to present themselves better to be more palatable . 
   sedevacantists why the s\u00e9d\u00e9vacantistes in particular ? 
  that 's oddly specific . 
  remember the fn 's reaction to breivik ? 
  because i do , and it was n't pretty . 
   and very secularism oriented the front national only uses the la\u00efcit\u00e9 ( `` secularism '' ) excuse to be able to shit on arabs/muslims . 
  you wo n't see them do the same when it 's the christians causing issues . 
  a bit , yeah . 
  maybe i 'm not hanging out in the right places !, 
  : o not everyday you see a reference to snatch . 
   the previous version of the article , which has since been edited , said that the man was one of the gens du voyage . 
  yes , it must have been a previous version -- i saw two of them myself while i translated it . 
  i was surprised because nowhere in these two versions did they say anything about the shooter being roma . 
  well , we 'll see soon enough anyway . 
   shooting between a roma man and two policemen ( gendarmes ) , with a roma woman and child among the wounded nowhere in the article does it say that the shooter was roma .
