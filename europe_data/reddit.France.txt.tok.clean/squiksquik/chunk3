  rough translation : ( version of 21h10 , le monde often updates its articles )  according to the * pr\u00e9fecture * , at least four people , among them a few months-old baby , have been killed during a shooting at roye , in the somme , in an area occupied by a community of * gens du voyage * . 
   three of the victims - a man , a woman and a 6 months-old baby - have been coldly executed by an armed man . 
  a * gendarme * ( policeman ) , who tried to come between , has also died from his wounds . 
   the three seriously injured are the shooter , another young child and a * gendarme * . 
  the seriously injured child was in cardiac arrest and has been put under respiratory assistance . 
   according to the minister of the interior , bernard cazeneuve , the shooter , `` somewhat drunk '' , entered the camp and `` coldly killed a 6 months old baby ( ... ) a man around forty years old [ and ] his daughter-in-law '' before the gendarmes arrived , the gendarmerie ( police station ) being close to the camp . 
   `` the * gendarmes * had no other choice to overpower the shooter than to shoot him in the legs '' , stressed the minister . 
   `` it 's an extremely dramatic affair that sparks very strong feelings '' , said the minister to the press . 
  important law enforcement measures have been deployed around the area of the shooting , close to an intermarch\u00e9 ( supermarket ) outside the town of roye . 
   incidents have taken place between some residents and the numerous journalists who have gone there . 
  to try and calm things down , the local * gens du voyage * community will be received on site by the * procureur de la r\u00e9publique * ( prosecutor of the republic ) , bernard farret , who traveled there . 
  the article says * gens du voyage * -- so it 's probably gypsies from france , not eastern europe . 
   christian continent it would be hilarious if it was n't that depressing . 
  it 's a [ saucisson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saucisson ) !, 
   was it a pedophile ring like in most of the others conspiracy theory i read in this thread ? 
  gods , no . 
  it would have been more about corruption cases , this kind of things . 
  yeah , most people focus on b\u00e9r\u00e9govoy but if anyone knew things , it 's clearly [ fran\u00e7ois de grossouvre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fran%c3%a7ois_de_grossouvre ) , who really was close to mitterrand . 
  he was , after all , mazarine 's godfather , the one who took care of campaign financing ... and that 's not even touching on his international work , his work in arms trade , etc. 
  the things this man must have known . 
  probably the suicide of [ pierre b\u00e9r\u00e9govoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_b%c3%a9r%c3%a9govoy ) , who was prime minister under fran\u00e7ois mitterrand for a time . 
  a lot of people think he was `` helped '' by our internal intelligence agency , the * renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux * ( rg ) ( `` general intelligence '' ) , because he was going to reveal information that could possibly trouble a lot of people . 
  there are a lot of things partly or completely unexplained , witnesses who do n't want to talk , witness accounts that do n't hold up , etc. 
  also the death of the humorist and actor [ coluche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coluche ) , who died in a motorcycle accident . 
  he was very politically engaged ( he also created what is now one of the biggest french charities , les [ restos du coeur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/restaurants_du_c%c5%93ur ) ) , not afraid of taking shots at anyone . 
  he also did a presidential stunt at some point ( and got 16 % in polls ! ) . 
  he is probably one of the most loved and respected people in france , even now . 
  a lot of people think he could have been killed by someone in power ( maybe the rg , like for b\u00e9r\u00e9govoy ) because he was too `` dangerous '' . 
  i have him tagged as an user of the late coontown , too . 
  i certainly do n't share the view , but i can think of the following reasons : * it 's `` the woman 's job '' ( basically , sexism ) . 
  i can picture it perfectly . 
  * if said pill is anything like the one for women , i.e. 
  hormonal , selfish men could refuse to take it for fear of side effects . 
  * `` but she 's already taking one ! '' . 
  i mean , in case of pregnancy the consequences are much more dire for the woman , so it 's not really a stretch to think that men would take it less seriously . 
  you just have to know some of these fucking idiots who do n't want to put a condom because it 's `` not as good '' to understand . 
  here 's to hoping we get rid of it someday . 
   [ -- ] gdre21111 il y a 3 heures  nazis did alot of bad shit but eradicating gypsies was not one of them . 
  just sad that they didnt get all of them . 
  `` druids '' and `` knights '' . 
  that 's kind of cute . 
   also , escargots are life !, 
  is n't it ? 
  for the terrorists to `` win '' , someone has to `` lose '' . 
  or `` wave a white flag stained with the blood of his comrades '' ( paraphrased ) , as the author of this article put it ( what in the everlasting hell , while i 'm on that ) . 
  but that 's not what i was saying , anyway . 
  what i 'm saying is that interpreting sourisseau 's words as an admission of fear , as an `` we are afraid of the big bad terrorists so we 're stopping '' is completely and utterly idiotic . 
  why the hell would they be afraid ** now ** when they were n't afraid a week after nine of their friends were killed ? 
  these people are saying that sourisseau is more afraid ** now ** than in the days after he saw his friends getting murdered ? 
  it 's sheer idiocy , yes , insulting to boot , and coming from someone who certainly did much less in his life than those he patronizes . 
  i 'll repeat what i 've already said on the subject :  they drew mohamed . 
   they drew mohamed after they were threatened . 
   they drew mohamed after they were firebombed . 
   they drew mohamed after nine of their own were killed . 
   what the fuck more do you want ? 
  `` terrorists win '' ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  so they fucking release a charlie hebdo with a mohamed on the cover ** a week ** after the shooting , but that 's not enough balls ? 
  what , did they somehow become afraid months after the fact ? 
  sourisseau realized he was afraid months after surviving by miracle the massacre of his friends in the office next door ? 
  enough of this fucking shit from people who do n't have a fucking clue , and certainly not a tenth of the spine displayed by charlie hebdo 's staff . 
  if by `` interesting '' you mean `` championship of shit-flinging '' . 
  yeah , they gave in so much that they released a charlie hebdo a week after the shooting with mohamed on the cover . 
  `` a little violence . '', 
  these fucking comments . 
  they drew mohamed . 
  they drew mohamed after they were threatened . 
  they drew mohamed after they were firebombed . 
  they drew mohamed after nine of their own were killed . 
  what the fuck more do you want ? 
  `` terrorists win '' ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  i am merely drawing a parallel between the nature of the * separate but equal * doctrine and the nature of * the same but with another name * argument . 
  anything else is at best a misinterpretation of my words . 
  it does n't matter how the doctrine was applied , it 's the principle behind that matters . 
  * arguing for another civil union that is just the same as the one that already exists * =  `` equal '' * ... but with another name . 
  * =  `` separate '' i 'll also add that technically , marriage as a contract provided and enforced by the state of germany * is * a civil union , as opposed to a religious one . 
  again , i agree with you . 
  on this :  also , there is no need to be sad about things . 
  there is no point being in a relationship if it is n't working out for you any more . 
  for france , i see that it is going to stop working out . 
  of course , there is no need -- but it is understandable , yes ? 
  leaving a relationship does n't erase the good things that came of it , or the feeling of disappointment if you think that it had a potential that has been wasted . 
  as long as you do n't dwell too much and move forward . 
  he 's not in the opposition now , and has n't been since 2009 . 
  coincidentally , germany 's trade surplus is  6 % for the fifth consecutive year this year , in clear violation of the ez stability rules , but we do n't hear much of `` lawyer scha\u00fcble '' on the subject . 
   as unemployment rates , growth rates and demographics of germany and france diverge , their interests start to diverge and inevitably the relationship deteriorates . 
  i 'm not buying the inevitability . 
  do n't get me wrong , i agree with what you 're saying , but `` inevitably '' ? 
  is there really * nothing * that could be done ? 
  ah , well . 
   so what ? 
  is there really a need for a good relationship with hollande who will be gone after the next election anyway ? 
  not until 2017 . 
  that 's almost two years -- a lot can happen in two years . 
  that 's also not accounting for the fact that our next president may very well share his views . 
  and there is , of course , the french people itself , which may not react well if it feels that the government is being strong-armed into something . 
  if the `` special relationship '' and its image were to deteriorate , a lot could change . 
  some would even say that it has already started . 
   so he is searching for new way to let the law stay intact and give greece the relief it needs .
