  a lot more police here than in the us , but you seldom notice them until needed . 
  does n't even count the rescue people , mostly volunteers . 
  not a country , but corsica is 5.16 / 100 000 http://www.dw.de/corsica-sets-sights-on-tackling-high-murder-rate/a-6345635, 
  it 's a great short-cut traveling from grenoble to munich !, 
  ( apple pie ), 
  super-u , leclerc , auchan , and carrefoure are better and less expensive . 
  the farmers ' markets are even better . 
  any deli . 
  tell us more ? 
  the best german bread is in new york city . 
  edeka has better selection and quality . 
  aldi is less expensive . 
  there is enormous diversity , but in france both partners have to work . 
  between us , we tend to visit weekly , * a huge chain , like carrefour , g\u00e9ant , or auchan * a frozens chain , like picard ( for urbans ) . 
  * the local farmer 's market * possibly a small shop ( butcher , baker , chocolate , or wine ), 
  a baguette is only good fresh-baked . 
  daily local shopping is a thing of the past ; we only shop once or twice a week now . 
  you are fine outside of work , after the first liter . 
  you are fine outside of work . 
  science can be art http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/physics.php, 
  germany , france , uk , italy , russia , spain , netherlands , turkey , switzerland , and then sweden are the top ten in order . 
  some of the individuals we are getting from the new countries are astonishing , talented people with fresh ideas . 
  scientific/industrial europe has a lot of incredible stuff going on , does n't it ? 
  we actually have very few accidents , considering the enormous traffic . 
  here is the list , sorry for the french , use google to translate . 
  have to admit , pasteur was french and the pharmaceutical industry is * very * influential in france . 
  still , that does not affect our culture , be it food , fashion , humanities , or cinema . 
  much . 
  i hope . 
  hmm ? 
  dead cheese for the american market . 
  dead enough to come on a boat . 
  it 's dead cheese , not * our * cheese . 
  if the us can exclude french cheese , we can exclude cheesy american tv . 
  like belgians , but less confident . 
  france wants its citizens critical and independent . 
  * they are !, 
  [ narega ] ( http://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/111428-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-narega.aspx ) is actually * doing * something about poverty . 
  it 's a good program . 
  ' i do n't speak french ' will certainly work . 
  [ do n't speak french ] ( http://www.parisdoparisdont.com/post/6173639047/3-dont-speak-french ), 
  never mind all that shite , uk are welcome in france , good chaps all around , cheers !, 
  sucks for american kids in europe . 
  sucks for english kids in american schools , too .

  go to florence and see how it all began !, 
  but not german bankers , who must be paid .

  truthfully , we kill people with * cars * much more than the usa . 
  i think its 2x in uk , 4x in france . 
  not proud of that part , sorry . 
  of course you are right . 
  europeans have different values than americans . 
  it 's the same as guns . 
  europeans do n't need substitutes because they have real sex . 
  where i live , when the conversation turns to culture , we show them our tractor . 
  nggh , ok if you call those * things * lobsters . 
  clams ? 
  cranberries ?

  lobsters !, 
  they pack them for you at airports in the northeast . 
  great engineers . 
  socially hopeless until after work , then it 's ok . 
  blessed be the eurii . 
  the comments section of the article is juicy . 
  stupidity rubbish guesswork ... 
  firefox is for porn . 
  i was a little suspicious that bureaucrats would do this right , so i tried to validate the data . 
  http://www.uis.unesco.org/pages/default.aspx that only deepened my doubts ; it 's all boilerplate and no science . 
  wow . 
  true . 
  how about a hot russian olympic athlete with a rock version of the national anthem ? 
  they can be obnoxious at the border , making up laws and stuff , but if you pay the sticker and go under ( not at ) the limit , it 's ok . 
  top winners are already marinated , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1nql1la_iw, 
  thanks . 
  do you know how the irs handles no-tip income tax ? 
  which says '' tipped labor must be paid a minimum of $ 2.13 per hour , as long as the hourly wage plus tipped income result in a minimum of $ 7.25 per hour . '', 
  not sure what happens in a no-tip situation . 
  anybody ? 
  do they even * have * spelling bees in other languages ? 
  or , maybe people who had the means to learn two languages are sharper to begin with . 
  for me , having to use another language just added to the confusion . 
  it 's true . 
  our 16yo daughter spent a year in germany . 
  she spent every weekend past midnight in night clubs . 
  on the other hand , she is impressively street-wise now . 
  switzerland * needs * people like tina turner . 
  was it your fault ? 
  the church rang its bells , so i think somebody must have gone . 
  not sure . 
  you * like * it like that . 
  woolies and rubbing your tummies together . 
  with what else ?
