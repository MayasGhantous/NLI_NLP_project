   the front national is n't a `` fascist '' party and it 's ridiculous to say it is it is debatable . 
  a lot of people believe the fn * is * fascist . 
  http://www.academie-francaise.fr a majority of men , a majority of older people , highly respected by those who cherish the language . 
  street talk is something else . 
  oh , really ? 
  maintenant , on se tutoie , apparamante . 
  does n't matter . 
  that was then and now is now . 
  the living french today define their own language . 
  for the french today , it refers to the sunburned british skin on the medeterranean beaches . 
  french skin is more resistant to the sun , and the climate is much sunnier than great britain 's . 
   it seems like the only unforgivable sin is intolerance , or someone telling someone else that what they 're doing is wrong . 
  that right there is the differance . 
  other than that , americans and europeans are more alike than different . 
  ok you have to start there and learn social engineering . 
  i only know italy from visits , but maybe the church or some other organisation like a workers union has travel connections you could use . 
  ask around . 
  for you , germany . 
  the culture is distinct from italy , and they are experts at having fun . 
  from dusseldorf , amsterdam and brussels are not far . 
  if you wrote this yourself , your english will get you around fine . 
  if you are a normal italian , your social engineering skills will get you cheap places to stay . 
  the constitution is a kind of living social contract , so of course there is a lot of debate about what it means and how it should evolve . 
  ya , a few really creepy ultra-rich people are plotting a hijack . 
  are n't those gi ? 
  it 's ok for muslim men , even diplomats . 
  you see it a lot . 
  `` kissing '' in france means pressing your cheeks together and making a kissy noise in the air . 
  anglo saxon kisses are smack on the lips , so it happens less often . 
  the tgv makes a good profit .

  well , not * mad * exactly , but * concerned * . 
  we switch language when we cross a border , for fun and culture . 
  we go there every summer for vacation , and they have the same adsl internet as all france . 
  the road signs are dual french/catalan . 
  the locals speak catalan to each other . 
  we switch our gps to catalan when we are there . 
  thanks !, 
  getting downvoted is worth it if i learn something . 
  good job !, 
  i think this answers my question , because it seems they speak hochdeutch in the flat protestant north , and not in catholic bavaria . 
  or what ? 
  the language of international business is english instead of french , japanese , german , russian , or chinese because globalism took off in the 1960 's when us business was tops everywhere . 
  maybe your own bank is more transparant and reliable , if something goes wrong ?

  `` we were together on the patio when the police arrived . 
  they were everywhere , but we ignored them . 
  they stopped a young man driving against a one-way street . 
  they were very agressive .

  it degenerated and they gassed us . '',

  one guy calls `` all the shots ! '', 
   public spending at approximately 55 percent of gdp so the public sector is more productive than the private sector ? 
  or is this whole article nonsense ? 
  some say the austrians are too emotional , some say they are too rigid . 
  it seems you are both at the same time .

  how is austrian gem\u00fctlichkeit different from the bavarian ?? 
  this is crucial !, 
  so , how is does austria differ from bavaria ? 
  this could be interesting . 
  the french are happy because the men have big dicks and the women learn sex in kindergarten .

  we visit him every year on the way back from vacation on the mediterranean beaches of languedoc-roussillon - the cheapest , least-crowded beaches in france . 
  i thought i knew montpellier at least a little , and it seems to be a good place to live and work .

  german banks gambled and they lost . 
  do n't be a sore loser , you won other times so pocket your winnings and go home . 
  the massive transfer of resources from the well-performing progressive states to the under-performing regressive states ? 
  they pretend markets are the voice of reason , the sword of justice . 
  they are not - the concentration of power is beyond all decency and absolutely not in any way of public benefit .
