i 'm pretty sure most of those supporting melenchon do n't want to leave the eu . 
   the eu has and is still making attempts at improving fiscal harmonisation . 
  nothing even happens suddenly . 
  nothing ever happens at all when the official policy is to support the rich and fuck over the poor . 
  in the 80s , soc dem , when asked why they were n't changing shit , promised things would change when they are enough in power and actually get a majority . 
  during the 90s , they got their majority and nothing changed . 
  we are getting a bit tired of asking for change for it to never , ever happen . 
  i do n't want to leave the europe , but there 's something i dislike more : being forced to apply neoliberal reforms all the time , cutting our rights ( el khomry law ) , our public services ( our postal service was gutted outside cities , the energy sector was open and areva is costing us billions and billions , and so on ) and cutting key-state jobs ( teachers , firefighters , policemen ) to get to the 3 % spending rule . 
  our quality of life is quickly decreasing and who really benefits from it except for big companies ? 
   others think that spending recklessly ( i.e. 
  more than 3 % gdp more than revenues , seriously , you guys give 0 fuck about budget management and long-term consequences ) is damaging for the economy and the poors at the end . 
  so better trust private companies and force countries to liberalise their economies . 
  we know private businesses with their wonderful ability to plan ahead and make long term investments are much better for the poor than nonprofit public services . 
   it 's more productive to work with others than saying `` do as i think it 's good or fuck off '' . 
  i 'd like to . 
  i believe in the possibility than we can compromise , and that other countries , and even different parties than leftist ones could side with us . 
  but i would n't support a european union were we are still forced to liberalise our economy to please brussel and the richest . 
  the fiscal policy of the eu allow companies like mcdonald ( which i have already used as an exemple somewhere else on the thread ) to make huge benefits in france ( 2nd country in europe for them ) and still pay all their taxes in ireland thanks to patent scams and other bullshit tax evasions . 
  if we ca n't agree on solving this , then why should we even stay ? 
  we ca n't spend as much as we want to boost our economy and help our poors because of the 3 % rule . 
  that effectively prevents us from doing socialist policies . 
  so what you 're saying is : you 're doomed with liberal fiscal policies and will have to keep destroying your workers rights . 
  see the el khomry law that the parliament had to force down our throat though a special article of the constitution ( 49.3 ) to answer an european directive . 
  so we have yet to vote , but as much as i support the idea of the union , if it prevents us from having the economic agenda we want , we ca n't stay in it if there is no change . 
  the ps is near 10 % and fillon is polled 3rd or 4th . 
  en marche is recent , le pen considers herself an outsider and so do jlm . 
  so his comment was right : our typical major parties are being destroyed by outsiders . 
  unless you want to tell me that en marche is a traditionnal party or that fillon is n't really 3rd/4th but 1st ? 
  what is the point that you 're trying to make ? 
  even if it were true ( and i doubt that every single european representative of each country + every head of government is against him ) , we should n't be able to have socialist policies because of the eu ? 
  because of a treaty ** we specifically voted against and that was passed against our will ** ? 
  that 's not only fraud , that 's blatantly incompetent fraud . 
  a huge part of it linked to the 2008 economic crisis . 
  not that i know of : / . 
  a quick search on google ( in french and in english ) did n't bring me anything . 
  that 's very unfortunate , because this very debate ( and the one with picketty and g\u00e9n\u00e9reux , another melenchon support ) is very interesting when it comes to their european vision . 
  hamon wants to build a parliament of the euro zone , partially composed of national representative ( who would compose 80 % of it ) . 
  but as he said , this is just a draft to debate upon , not a definitive idea . 
  and anyway , it would have to be debated in all the parliaments of the euro zone . 
  the policies melenchon specifically talks about are blocked by european treaties ( spending rule , budget rule , making companies pay taxes in every country according to the benefits it realizes in it , to counteract , for exemple , macdonalds which pays all its taxes in europe in ireland , and so on ) . 
  edit : i 'll quote coquerel in a mediapart debate with thomas piketty ( coquerel supports melenchon , piketty supports hamon ) . 
  `` if we want to build europe - we want to - it can only be if it is a human progress for every people * ( in the sense `` populace '' , for every nationalities if you wish ) * within it . 
  it can not only be for it is supposed to be , as something we ca n't do without that would justify , like we have done for thirty years , to break social rights , democratic rights , in the name of the europe . 
  melenchon is rising , but as it stands , macron is the favorite . 
   that would be the end of private companies , the end of biotechs , start-ups , ... 
  it would mean the end of the eu . 
  that 's pretty unfortunate that the poor who keep getting poorer with each socialist and republican candidate do n't want to keep going in a path that only really benefits the richest . 
   that were co-shaped by liberal french politicans for the last ~ 20 years . 
  including a treaty we * refused to sign * that our parliament still passed two years later , and two majority leaders ( nicolas sarkozy and fran\u00e7ois hollande ) whose five years in powers were enough to make people hate them both with quite a passion . 
  we want to be progressive . 
  right now , we ca n't . 
  right now , mc donald 's is paying nothing in europe thanks to the irish tax system . 
  it 's unfair of us to the irish or the luxembourg to change their tax system , they do what they see fit . 
  but we ca n't keep getting stole by big companies because of them . 
  our politicians are always talking about lazy people receiving public money . 
  abuse on this are estimated around 200 million euros . 
  tax fraud represents 60 billions in france alone . 
  like many melenchon voters , i love the eu . 
  i love many things it has given us , including the soft end of borders , the proximity between nations , the fact that we have a common goal , and that we make sacrifices for each other . 
  but we ca n't do the policies we want to do to help our people . 
  the treaties prevent us from doing so . 
  what are we supposed to do ? 
  be resigned to only have social liberal policies ? 
  see the rise of the national front because of these policies that destroy the lives of the poorest , without being able to change anything about their situations because the ones in power right now have no interest in fixing job security or the fact that so many people live on the edge of poverty ? 
  the far right still kill people nowadays . 
  cl\u00e9ment meric would disagree with you , for exemple . 
   we 've seen how `` mohammedans '' get political these days , beating gays in the streets of paris . 
  ref . 
  necessary, 
  `` fall to islam '' what the hell are you talking about ? 
  other difference between the two : in the french system , you can either adopt a child alone ( as a single parent ) or as a married couple . 
  you ca n't adopt a kid as a pacsed couple , which means that if a gay couple wants to have a child , only one of them can be the legal parent . 
  the other has no right and would be separated from the child if his legal parent dies . 
  that 's one of the big reasons why gay marriage was an important issue . 
  because poor people do n't always have a choice ? 
  working for uber is easy , and you can do something else . 
  i do n't know if you have noticed , but the job market for the unemployed is heavily , ** heavily ** in favors of employers . 
  if taxis were n't so scummy , i 'd gladly pay more than for uber , which abuses its workers . 
  but taxis are n't only expensive , they 're also absolute assholes . 
  i 've had fun discussions with uber drivers , and only dead silence or arguing with my taxi drivers because they were trying to rip me off or something . 
   why is there never any introspection from the left ? 
  why do you try to turn this into a left vs right issue ? 
  taxis are scummy abusers who locked the sector for their own benefits , while uber abuses its workers by refusing to call them what they are : employees . 
  they do n't get representant in the parliament if you '' re talking about poutou and arthaud 's party, 
  first , m\u00e9lenchon is n't a trotskist . 
  he was when he was younger , but so were former pm lionel jospin or even some of sarkozy 's closest . 
  the main difference between poutou ( new anticapitalist party ) and arthaud ( lutte ouvri\u00e8re ) is that arthaud is very old school , considers that every discrimination is caused by capitalism and so on . 
  the npa is n't comprised only of trotskists , but of many shards of the radical left . 
  with the maastricht treaty ? 
  with the amsterdam treaty ? 
  with the treaty of nice ? 
  i do n't know if your representative chose for you or if you had referendum , but the uk was in fact involved in a political affair , not just an economic one . 
   but mlp will most likely be the main opposition party . 
  she is here for a very long time . 
  probably not . 
  the southern fn is very displeased with the line of the party and marine 's purges . 
  it has been said multiple time that philippot 's influence is under attack , for being too leftist on politics . 
  without philippot , the fn is dead . 
  he 's the reason the party 's doing so well , taking in people disappointed in other parties . 
  if mar\u00e9chal-le pen win her fight against him , the old guard will come back and the party will shift towards its old tendencies .
