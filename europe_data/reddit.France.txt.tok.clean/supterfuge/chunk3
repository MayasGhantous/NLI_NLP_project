  this also lead to a contested `` strategy '' which is called the * d\u00e9sistement r\u00e9publicain * . 
  since more than two parties can go to the second round in the legislative elections , you often have two parties facing the front national . 
  the tradition is for the candidate who had the less voices in the second round to withdraw and let the other non-fn candidate win uncontested . 
  the `` parti radical de gauche '' is one of our oldest party ( it was jules ferry and i think cl\u00e9menceau 's ) . 
  so its position has changed over the years . 
  it 's also quite a small party that has survived nowadays by being influent in the political sphere and getting an alliance with the socialist party to get mps in . 
  but they are n't talked about much and i do n't think many people would consider themselves closer to the radical left party than to others . 
  but one of the very point of the eu is that access to the single market is only possible if you concedes to the four liberties . 
  if you successfully get one without the other , the eu is dead . 
  it ca n't let that happen . 
  as a young dude , i still do n't know why the rainbow warrior was n't a much larger scandal than it was . 
  shit is fucked . 
  many on the left are accusing melenchon of building everything around him . 
  while the french communist party ( pcf ) rolled with it for the presidential election , they are wary of him since he went in the election without talking with them . 
  also , a big chunk of the ps is about to leave or is pushing to build a new movement . 
  finally , you have lots of young people who [ refuse to be governed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coxsdkb-rwu&amp;t=1s ) and may help shape the political spectrum because the institutionnal left ( both radical and center ) will have to position itself against them . 
  it depends of the language . 
  i do n't know for gaelic names , but in english you either have , as it has been mentionned , both part glued together ( johnson for son of john ) , or the first part dropped . 
  for exemple french surname lefevbre becomes smith ; dubois becomes wood , and so on . 
  she 's marine 's niece , not her daughter, 
  fun fact about the word * oignon * ( that will now be * ognon * ) . 
  many people are angry that the * i * will disappear , thinking it used to be pronounced and should be kept in the word . 
  well , first of all , that would be a mistake because languages evolve , we are n't speaking latin anymore , why would we write in latin ? 
  but the most important thing is that it never was meant to be oi-gn-on . 
  the `` i '' was used with the `` gn '' to make the sound '' / \u0272 / '' . 
  it was actually o-ign-on , and pronounced the same as today . 
  we can see another exemple like this one from one of our most famous philosophers - montaigne . 
  his name was pronounced `` montagne '' when he was alive . 
  yay for chirac, 
   the french revolution began in 1789 , and lasted about 10 yrs . 
  14 july 1789 was the date of the storming of the bastille , and now 14 july is known as bastille day and is france 's national holiday . 
  actually , officially , we are also celebrating on the 14th of july the * f\u00eate de la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration * that happened in 1790 . 
  it was a party held to commemorate the 14th of july 1789 , during which the king pledged to the nation and the law . 
  it 's important because what is celebrated is n't so much the revolution only , but also the nation uniting after the revolution . 
  well , it turned out that things did n't go very well later , but still , 14th of july is the * f\u00eate de la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration * . 
  the choice was made in 1880 to solidify the iiith republic , and its double meaning was very important to get it through and really get the republic idea definitely in people 's heads . 
   something else i 'd like to add about language : france rather infamously eliminated most of their minority languages . 
  :( and many politicians still refuse any kind of support for regional languages . 
  i do n't even have one since i 'm from paris , but damn if we are n't a crazy bunch when it comes to that . 
  i think you 're making quite a fuss about an uneducated comment . 
  i do n't think the eu leaders are so reckless and careless in their diplomacy that they would do such a mistake . 
  they could , possibly , decide to drop juncker to change how the negociations are going , in a sign of good faith . 
  but i do n't think they would ever consider asking may to resign ... 
  yes , [ louis xx ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_de_bourbon_\\ ( 1974 \\ ) ) , although he obviously is n't reigning . 
  what about the fact that the emergency state has allowed the french state to go after [ climate activists ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/paris-climate-activists-put-under-house-arrest-using-emergency-laws ) or even drug dealers ? 
  it 's not about supporting drug deals , but we have laws in place for a reason , and this emergency state is a fraud used to prevent the judges from assuming their role . 
  what about r\u00e9mi fraisse who was shot by a cop from meters away while being pacifist , what about th\u00e9o luhaka or adama traor\u00e9 ? 
  the system is oppressive and they keep going after the poors , the non-whites and political activists . 
  but hey , in the name of property , fuck police accountability , fuck the poor , and all of those who resist . 
  you value private property more than human decency and solidarity . 
  a shame . 
  yeah , that 's why the unions are so strong in these movement . 
  obviously , they are unions of teenagers . 
  oh wait , no it does n't exist . 
  these are worker unions , and workers , unemployed and students protesting . 
  people who wo n't vote for her already hate her . 
  thanks . 
  corrected . 
  i do n't think you understand very well how politics work . 
  while macron is n't liked by many outside of his party , le pen is absolutely hated by everyone . 
  nicolas dupont-aignan 's party crumbled when he announced that he was rallying her and there have been protests in the town of which he is mayor asking for his resign . 
  three of his four vice-president have resigned , and so his right arm olivier clodong . 
  le pen is n't `` right-wing '' . 
  it 's not the right against the left . 
  a candidate that is the closest you can get to anticapitalist without being one said that it was no mystery what he was going for , and called for no one to vote for le pen ; hamon , candidate of the socialist party , said that while macron was a political opponent , le pen was an enemy of the republic , and that he would vote for him . 
  more recently , he said about voting for macron `` a difficult act but an obvious choice '' . 
  even fran\u00e7ois fillon , candidate of the right wing , called to support macron . 
  since it 's obvious that there will be no massive support for her , the only thing that could bring her to the elys\u00e9e is apathy , but i would n't count on that either . 
  many think the danger is real and will go out and vote , and many have probably been remembered tonight how impossible it was to discuss with the far right . 
  a bit of fillon and melenchon 's voters , and a huge part of their base that does n't plan to vote . 
  honestly , i would n't be surprised if the score end way better than this 60/40 we have seen there . 
  a few months ago , she was polled at 30 % . 
  she ended up doing just a bit more than 20 % , and developped absolutely no point of her plan tonight . 
  [ even le pen 's supporters discord admitted it . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/jacques_pezet/status/859851110399586306 ) [ another exemple . 
  ] ( https://t.co/51mkhe7vuf ), 
  mlp 's defeat could bring mmlp to the spotlight . 
  the fn is going to murder philippot if they lose , the man behind their surge . 
  mmlp is his direct competitor . 
  i 'm shit at politics , but i 've heard two french economist talk about it recently , and they basically agreed that it could be a good solution , but on a very short term . 
  it 's not a new system built to last , but allows transitions and crisis situations . 
  many are n't voting ; does n't mean they would like le pen over macron . 
  many left voters are sending the message `` you are the reason the fn is rising '' ; and many right wing voters wo n't vote for macron ( they hate hollande too much for that ) , but still despite the fn . 
  i do n't see myself advocating for communism here . 
  just said that it 's baseless to say that communism hurts people . 
  the stalinist model we see , the state capitalism of the chinese state , the political paranoia of latin america are n't representation of what the communism is supposed to be . 
  and while i find a thousand problems with capitalism , again , i 'm not advocating for communism . 
  do n't think it would work . 
  french people here . 
  i 've been to a few protests these last years . 
  basically , relationship between cops and protesters have deteriorated in the last years . 
  there were a few protests under sarkozy ( especially for the retirement pension reform ) , but not that much . 
  since the terrorist attacks though , the police has been particularly violent - and so were the protesters . 
  the government - supposed to be left wing - passed a few laws that many leftists opposed , and the government 's reaction was repression . 
  they sent the cops [ against students ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrprc67eh2i ) . 
  they pressure [ journalists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4llivkvqgq ) and let 's say that [ the police is n't pacifist either . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phkj0bnuvsc ) so the police has been particularly violent these last years , and the protesters particularly angry . 
  government is [ accused by some of its cops ] ( http://www.konbini.com/fr/tendances-2/loi-travail-police-manifestant-syndicat/ ) of letting protests explode this way to undermine the protesting movements . 
  also , during the cop 21 ( paris agreement ) , many green militants were issued bans on certain areas or house arrests ( via a procedure that is part of the emergency state and usually used for terrorists ) [ without judges agreemen ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/11/28/01016-20151128artfig00042-des-militants-ecologistes-assignes-a-residence-le-temps-de-la-cop21.php ) t. ie the government treated nonviolent political opponents like terrorists, 
  when i met with nanterre 's cnt and antifas , i remember seeing mostly students with a few manual workers ( often friends of other antifas who joined them to fight ) .
