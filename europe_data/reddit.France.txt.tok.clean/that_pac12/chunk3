  it 's ridiculous , but not that surprising . 
  it is subject to change , i 'm just sitting here waiting for the green party to win more than one seat . 
  saw the map and thought that czechia wanted to annex them . 
  it 's in the * constitution * ? 
  that 's such bullshit . 
  yaaaaaasss !, 
  i wish it was still red , but [ japan kindof stole that from us ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/tarotokyo-20110314-tokyotower-01.jpg ) . 
  ( minus the two-time interim president poher . ), 
  france 's fifth republic looks very similar to germany 's . 
  making up for lost time , are we ? 
  honestly , why does n't everybody annex portugal ? 
  fair enough then . 
  i live in america atm . 
  yea , that would make the most sense . 
  lmao , good luck calling 96 meps if you live in germany . 
  that 's a double-ouchey for britain . 
  my history teacher had the same gripe , he wants belgium to be partitioned because everything was closed on sunday ( when he arrived by boat from the uk ) . 
  lmao, 
  lmao andorra and belgium . 
  this whole situation can be summed up in one word : covfefe, 
  covfefe . 
  i would n't worry about canada . 
  india , maybe . 
  but china is the one to watch out for , though china has little choice at this point . 
  china is destroyed , you ca n't drink the water and you ca n't breathe the air . 
  america is at that perfect balance of incredible ignorance and not being as fucked as china , atleast atm . 
  europe needs to be ready for world leadership , us power is waiting faster and faster under trump as countries seek to distance themselves and make themselves independent of from america and her scandal-plagued , nearly six-month-old government . 
  the end of american relyability is the end of american world dominance , it will take alot to recover from this by the end of his term , whenever that may be , america will have a serious mess to clean up . 
  that is definitely why . 
  really ? 
  that 's wacky . 
  interesting , i always think of red when it comes the old soviet union as a whole , ( for obvious communist reasons ) but the russian federation has never been red for me , always purple . 
  always interesting to hear about weird stuff like this . 
  lmao , no idea . 
  national geographic uses pink and may have influenced me in my early years , maybe my brain also mixes in some blue from the flag too . 
  anyway , what colour do you think russia is ? 
  let me know if you have a violently different view of some of these colours . 
  ( and , sidenote : i only used basic colour groups , some countries that i labeled orange/brown ( luxembourg for example . ), 
  i actually think of it as sort of a peachy colour , this is also true for most countries , most of them have a particular shade to them ( i.e. 
  : greece is very light blue . ), 
  i think some of the influence comes from the flag of the country ( like aforementioned greece ) , and some comes from national geographic 's map colour scheme ( i.e. 
  : belarus ) . ), 
  i love this . 
  any french preident has pretty minimal backing , noone wins in the first round afterall . 
  true true . 
  this map is not the full story . 
  ugh , even worse is that they got fucking * labour * floundering aswell . 
  decline likely began when they looked at america and the uk and went : lolnope . 
  in france it also has to do with the fact that the president 's party often has a majority in parliament , so the socialists will be crushed and the centrists ( perhaps just en marche ! ), 
  will be able to govern on their own . 
  not even trump himself was this bad . 
  he actually ** congratulated ** macron in a surprise mature move . 
  yea , on the english wikipedia page , definitely t_d . 
  they should n't know about or talk about politics in other countries ? 
  that 's completely ridiculous !, 
  it is some beautiful symbolism behind our flag it is . 
  well yea , by region it was a unanimous macron victory , but the us system still fucking sucks either way . 
  also really easy to rant about to release some frustration . 
  what a fucking sespool . 
  to be fair it 's not like they ca n't . 
  then why ? 
  there is no reason that is shouldnt be considered credible , it does n't spread conspiracy theories and fake news . 
  cnn is perfectly credible . 
  just ... no . 
  an economic collapse would follow an eu collapse . 
  perfect breeding ground for the public to elect nationalists who make impossible promises , war would likely ensue within only a few decades . 
  ( depending on how well nato holds up ofcourse . ), 
  it seems like a worst-case scenario , but it 's happened before . 
   and why are you so afraid of russia ? 
  its not that they have done anything in a very long time . . [ boi ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation_of_crimea_by_the_russian_federation ), 
  well ... it would . 
  le pen would take a softer stance on russia . 
  and besides that , do you honestly believe for a second that the collapse of the european union would n't benefit russia ? 
  coal miners . 
  honestly i 'm surprised she did n't win in paca or grand est. 
  paca is rich and very conservative , they would have preferred fillon . 
  and grand est is large , mostly flat , and mostly rural , so yea . 
  she did n't surge as hard as anticipated , thank fuck . 
  so close to that yellow domination . 
  :p damn . 
  lmao , u thought, 
  your fear is irrational . 
  i fear no attack because it is not only statistically unlikely , but exactly what terrorists want , they want me to fear , to rely on my basic instincts and make decisions out of fear . 
  i will not i will do what i believe is best for france , for ** europe ** , and for future generations . 
  to be fair , who does n't want to be more like sweden ? 
  talk about perfection . 
  such is the life of finland . 
  luckily very true , such a perfect storm is unlikely to come again for le pen and the national front , hopefully this is the only bullet we have to dodge . 
  vive la france !, 
  et vive l'europe !!!, 
  \u2764 \u2764 love to all from france !, 
  i 've never even so proud !, 
  here 's to european unity , now and forever !, 
  oh shit , that 's actually insane . 
  i love everything about this photo . 
  who can resist that iron puss ? 
  even in the face of terror france will not vote for fear , say what you will about the security measures , today france has made it clear that we will not be deterred . 
  a victorious day for france !, 
  france will not bow to fear , terror attacks , or extremism . 
  france , and europe , will persevere , together .
