  vive la france , vive la r\u00e9publique , et vive l'europe . 
  victory for france !, 
  victory for the republic !, 
  yea , poor wording i 'd say , but the endorsement is a huge help regardless . 
  t h e p e r f e c t p l a n, 
  that 's because he is a centre-right cantidate . 
  i mean , i 'm sure serbia hates him ... like they hate everyone else ... r/serbia is an angry place , man . 
  like , buzzfeed ? 
   some lessons were learned a little too late . 
  : / as usual i 'm afraid . 
  ugh , still ca n't believe blair 14 years on . 
  obama himself won twice soooo ... ( you 're confusing correlation with causation . ), 
  he honestly would have been better off if hollande just stayed quiet , ah well , too late for that now . 
  i 'm *** shocked *** . 
  -_- did anyone not expect this ? 
  i absolutely adore this . 
  what is it with royalty and silly hats ? 
  yea they 're bad , ( kind of , i mean atheism is n't bad and it 's in there , but i digress ) but only war , lies , and apathy are the only ones that pose even a minute threat to europe . 
  ( crime too , i guess , but it 's really uncommon compared to the rest of the world , so , meh . ), 
  religion is a greater and more prevalent threat , afterall religious extremism ( particularly islamic via daesh atm ) is a pretty big concern , and christianity has n't been any help either , especially in the past , not that it 's any more helpful right now . 
  * officaly * i know this happened , but officially he has n't endorsed , only called him , though that is the next best thing to endorsement . 
  not if its dictatorial . 
  i 'm just pointing out that a lot of people say this and it 's absolutely mind-numbing . 
  rip rip no lucid dreams for / u/pm _ me_lucid_dreams, 
  gah , i wish . 
  fptp is so fucking shit . 
  she definitely was going to raqqa . 
  if obama officially backed marcon , he would s u r g e. france loves obama . 
  why do people give putin credit for being a `` strong '' leader ? 
  like : `` i do n't like putin because he 's a dictator , but you got ta hand it to him he certainly have an iron-fisted grip on russia . '', 
  # ... what the fuck ? 
  apparently the electorate is just as gullible . 
  and really good democracy . 
  ugh , same in new england this weekend , actually 25 , but whatevs ) disgustingly hot . 
  yes , it 's a magical land known as : * mississippi * :o, 
  oh fuck , i want to be pmed lucid dreams too . 
  you are probably the only person in the uk who knew that . 
  yes pls, 
  why u crush my dreams like that ? 
  let 's eat grandma !, 
  let 's eat , grandma !, 
   that , in correct place is important . 
  indeed, 
  police police police police police police police police . 
  ouch, 
  welsh ? 
  we are doomed to repeat our mistakes because so few live long enough to see them repeated . 
  always the ideal situation . 
  god , i fucking love eurovision . 
  cute try at growth , russie . 
   one can not deny the # `` fact ''  that it 's abnormal watch me, 
  wow , i 'm *** s h o c k e d *** !, 
   stability is king in germany . 
  and thank fuck for that . 
  there are [ some absolutely gorgeous ones tho ] ( https://m.imgur.com/a/rpzhc ) . 
  i had no idea until to today that lithuania was so adamantly pro-eu . 
  if only france thought so highly of our creation . 
  thanks for the article , very informative . 
  unless you 're a liver . 
  can we please have your sensible people , i wish more people were like germans today , often so rational and collected . 
  well , yea , there is no official `` west '' that a country can be admitted to afterall . 
  but as an eu & nato member i consider poland `` pretty western '' . 
  ( my official poland status . ), 
  eu & nato member , pretty western . 
  also slavic not antonymic to western , one can be both . 
  i mean , the eu already de jure considers northern cyprus part of the eu anyway . 
  so the tea party can take over the gop , but that would n't happen if they were an actual party that ran on a far-right platform , then everyday republicans would n't be voting for a maniac just to avoid a democratic president . 
  if they had choice donald trump would have lost , because in a second round there are no third-party spoiler votes , this flips states to hillary . 
  so under a two-round system the us would have elected hillary clinton , electoral college or not . 
  poland is western ... 
   they just want to have a good government . 
  a fair goal . 
  what is the appeal of the ruling party then , outside of its eu politics ? 
  i honestly have no idea if that particular woman was widely reported , i have no specific memory of it , but it 's entirely possible considering the huge number of news stories that came out of calais and the migrant camp . 
  as for if i believe if french press is free , well , ofcourse , all eu nations have pretty good records in general when it comes to general freedoms , press , economic , etc. . 
  i was under the impression that the pis had attempted to implement some dodgy laws however , as far as i know they were prevented from doing much damage . 
  well , yea , it goes without saying that poand is no north korea , as i said i know next-to-nothing about polish politics , i appreciate the insight . 
  ew , religion . 
  the us system is quite possibly the worst of any western democracy . 
  there is no real choice . 
  other parties do n't stand a chance . 
  there were allegations that the party in power had tried to restrict freedom of the press , expression , and speech . 
  i 'm honestly not well versed on the situation , however . 
  poland 's social goals ? 
  what exactly are those ? 
  they ca n't be that great . 
  then wtf is the composition of your parliament , orb\u00e1n 's eurosceptic party can govern with the kdnp but hungary is n't eurosceptic ? 
  as much as i 'd like to think that hungarians are still pro-eu their choices do n't exactly highlight the populous 's europhillia . 
  yes , can never be too sure . 
  but in neither of these cases in 20 % or 24 % of the electorate choosing who wins , that is the beauty of the french presidential system , vote for who you like , then vote for the one you have the most in common with . 
  initial support is smaller , but a president could never be electected this way , otherwise we would n't ever have one . 
   there are actually a lot of left-wing voters who are claiming they wo n't vote at all they 're true idiots . 
  shoutout to germany for having its shit together as usual . 
  meh , he was n't my first choice , hamon was my first choice , but after seeing him at 8 % i went for m\u00e9lenchon for that sweet , sweet parliamentary system . 
  needless to say , it did n't happen . 
  i 'm not * entirely * opposed to macron , i do n't like his economic policies , but i think we need a strong pro-eu and pro-globalisation leader in times like these , and i think he needs to kick ass to show that the far-right is not the go-to for improvelent and change . 
  i prefer le pen 's more socialist-leaning economic policy to macron 's near-neoliberalism , but social policy is more important to me . 
  yea , should be about 100-0 . 
  that 's ideal . 
  i hope so , i 'm so scared .
