  if there is there better be a poll of polls for polls of polls . 
  over le pen , i guess , but over anyone sane , not a chance . 
  good , 20 % of the electorate should n't be able to decide who wins , and 20 % is actually pretty close to the worst-case-scenario us election , so there 's that . 
  that is alarming . 
  you obviously have no idea what the eu is if you think it is socialist . 
  american , i take it ? 
  shhhh , it 's a secret, 
  he 's pretty far out there . 
  he is literally neoliberal , it 's just a fact , you ca n't argue with that fact . 
  he 's not being called that because he works for a bank , that 's just what he is . 
  bulgaria get your shit together !, 
  not happy , just sane enough to not vote for le pen . 
  oh thank fuck . 
  yay portugal !, 
  yea , always cool when this stuff happens, 
  idk , sorry about that , i 'm using safari, 
  that does n't make it right , intelligent , or `` the future '' . 
  the best part is that le pen is the one who embodies the past , threatening to bring back the violent nationalism that destroyed europe twice before . 
  because of ignorant people like you we will repeat the mistakes of those before us , she is nothing new . 
  le pen is old news . 
  yet for some reason this map lacks french polynesia ... 
  it 's also important to keep in mind that this is n't the full story , le pen may have won those departments , but she by no means has a majority . 
  that sucks . 
  shoutout to latvia and bulgaria for being boring . 
  xd \u2764 u guys anyway, 
  fucking people do n't know what they have until it 's gone , are we doomed to repeat the same mistakes because we ca n't live long enough to see them repeated ? 
  nice notably voted for fillon an not le pen . 
  xd ( while she did get 25 % of the vote , fillon got 26 % , macron 20 % , m\u00e9lenchon 17 % , and hamon 4 % . ), 
  lol , no it 's does n't . 
  it counts . 
  damn , she looks three decades younger tho . 
  is n't bernie sanders 's wife like 3 decades younger than him though ? 
  i do n't think it mattered to america , which is saying something . 
  atleast you spelled your bad joke correctly . 
  :p it would probably work out somehow . 
  but montenegro borders croatia . 
  looks like it , i mean , unless you wanted to put kosovo in , you 'd have to change some stuff up for that too ... 
  rip rip, 
  yaaassss, 
  that 's actually pretty convenient for neighbor-counting purposes . 
  nice try boyo , but france and the netherlands are both blue , and they border [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_martin ) . 
  you 're right , in fact greece + armenia = 2 countries . 
  and 2 is less than 3 !, 
  well , yea , free world \u2260 perfect world . 
  * w\u00f6rk, 
  makes sense , i guess it was kindof obvious , though i suppose i just thought it a coincidence . 
  that 's alright , btw , that 's not a catal\u00e1n-cuban flag , it 's just an alternative catal\u00e1n flag . 
  i 'm not a seperatist , to my understanding catalu\u00f1a could quite possibly try to leave spain . 
  she definitely is now , and i do n't really have a problem with it . 
  to be fair , europe in general is a beautiful * state * . 
  i 'm *** shocked *** . 
  yea , luxembourg is super rich , but is n't their external debt like ~ ~ 3 600 % ~ ~ ** 6 200 % ** of their gdp ... that 's a pretty hollow victory . 
  edit : [ my bad , it 's alot worse than 3 600 % . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_external_debt ), 
   and their cuisine totally sucks that 's denial in its purest form . 
  lmao , nice username . 
  oh , interesting . 
  but what if catalu\u00f1a leaves spain soon ? 
  i mean , i guess it could be their headquarters for , like , a few months . 
  xenophobes at it again , tisk , tisk . 
  because they 've been there and done that , like the comic depicts , and germany will never do it again . 
  but the populace and easily be tricked , afterall the us elected donald trump , this stuff has real effects . 
  preferably the first decade or so . 
  ireland actively striving for that sweet , sweet pre-famine population . 
  says , half the population , that 's who . 
  and you can be european and right-wing , just look at the european parliament . 
  solid choice . 
  yea , that 's true . 
  atleast we have canada , and likely fance wo n't fall , i think we can ward her off . 
  it 's not to prove anything , it 's just interesting . 
  you 're right , how could we have been so out of line ? 
  tisk tisk , we here just asking for brexit . 
  no , i think we know , russia already beat america , but the netherlands survived , and hopefully framce and the rest of europe will too . 
  ok , that does n't mean kick the piss out of anyone who thinks that we should n't be constantly shitting on obese people . 
  do you mean jobbik or something else , that 's not very surprising to me . 
  emperortigerstar always comes through . 
  that 's now , but without the eu a sizeable degree of stability is lost , things could change , it 's not certain , but it 's a much greater possibility . 
  that 's keeping europe left-wing , which would be nice , but you ca n't keep people from coming in because they have a different political opinion than you . 
  if you put the welsh dragon on there it 's looks pretty nice tho . 
  #why is this even allowed ? 
  agreed , circumcision should be banned , it is unethical and wrong . 
  \u2022 - \u2022 i ca n't believe i never even heard about this ... 
  #paris commune intensifies, 
  i was thinking hamon , but he 's doing really bad so , idk ... 
  good idea m9 . 
  yes , as is often the case . 
   lindsay kantha souvannarath was obsessed by school shootings and nazism lmao , i think i 've read enough . 
  that brings our tally up to 1 . 
  lolol , soon to not an eu citizen anymore . 
  so ... you want to replace the `` elitist visa system '' with an elitist irreligious system ? 
  what exactly keeps these people from lying anyway ? 
  those with `` progressive values '' would oppose your plan , it 's discriminatory , it 's not like you 're turning people away because they 're violent . 
  lol , does he even care about montenegro ? 
  i mean , they 've been in the process for a little while so if he has any objections he probably would have made them clear by now . 
  :p and even if he does n't like it , oh well . 
  yea , most people consider healthy pretty , and for good reason , it 's healthy . 
  i just do n't understand that the second the conversation turns to obese people everyone becomes an asshole . 
  why 's that ? 
  lol , fun times . 
  that 's alright , i have a working one now , sorry about that , idk why it was n't working .
