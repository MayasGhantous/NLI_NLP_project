  that 's good , i hope montenegro will join soon , but it will sadly be a few more years . 
  idk , but i got schulz too !, 
  her dad right ? 
  *** that *** will keep you safe . 
  i got schulz , i 'm pumped . 
  really , because you sound more like a trump to me , you know , discriminating refugees by religion and all . 
  that 's exactly what it is . 
  i 'm assuming you say that in full knowledge that he married his teacher . 
  me too !, 
  pumped for schulz !, 
  that moment when you forget that beauty is subjective . 
  interesting note : for the first 30 minutes this survey was up the only groups with any votes were ecr , efdd , & enf ( + a few non-inscrits & my s&d vote ) . 
  it took an abrupt left-wing turn after that though . 
  lol , i was just saying that it 's alot of information . 
  this ... this is what we 've come to ? 
  hamon was the goal orginially , but he has no chance now , m\u00e9lenchon is my second choice , he 's left-wing and wants to bring more power to parliament , both in france ( via the sixth republic ) and the eu ( via reform , likely through amendments and re-negotiated treaties . ), 
  i have hope , the way i see it , there are three very likely possibilities , le pen vs. m\u00e9lenchon , le pen vs. macron , & macron vs. m\u00e9lenchon . 
  le pen is likely to loose regardless , leaving m\u00e9lenchon winner of one and macron winner of two of these scenarios , either way the eu either changes and may have more of a chance as a more democratic institution or macron keeps the status quo and if he does a good job with the economy we can ride out this wave of far-right populism , perhaps if he does well enough and secures himself a second term we might be in the clear . 
  i 'm just hoping we can keep the eu together at this point , i think it 's vital and the eu will collapse without france . 
  so m\u00e9lenchon , because i think if he can make europe more democratic , the eurosceptics will have less of an argument , but macron is appealing because i know that he will fight for the eu the way it is now , despite its flaws . 
  macron 's encryption comments also threw me off , i do n't think governments have a right to unlock that , then they can see * everything * ... but yea , it 's kindof loaded , but that 's my general stance . 
  fair point , i do n't like how belarus is so subservient to russia , even if lukashenko may be changing his allegiance slightly . 
  yea , i know , but they 're soft-eurosceptic , i prefer the centre-left europhillic party instead . 
  idk if strawpoll.me is up for that , i mean ... one * could * make 27-28 polls using national parties on their respective subreddits and tally up the results by parliament group , that would be cool ... and very time-consuming . 
  edit : it was r/europeanparliament not r/eu ( fyi ) . 
  all i 'm saying is that they 're both poor nations compared to the resy of euorpe , therefore my opinion is that i would rather live in ukraine than belarus , and i say that the gdp per capita of belarus is about 17,000 int $ vs. ukraine 's 8,000 . 
  this is a fraction of richer countries like sweden at around 48,000 int $ . 
  ukraine atleast tries to run a democracy , so that 's where i 'd want to be . 
  only a couple hundred . 
  when your talking on the scale of ukraine and belarus it 's not that big a difference . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're joking or not ... 
  lolol , typical dutch . 
  fair point , but i 'd rather live in a poor democracy than a slightly less poor dictatorship . 
  for now nato would leave some form of unity in the continent , however that , aswell , is subject to potential change . 
  thanks , i thought so too , the alde did so well . 
  sorry about that , the table should help you approximate , they 're pretty evenly split . 
  well , not now , but things could change , turkey has been a democracy for over a hundred years , that just changed . 
  you would be far from alone in that decision it seems . 
  i have no idea ... \u2022 - \u2022, 
  unless the eu changes , it will fail , it must adapt to survive , i think a european union is inevitable , even if this one fails , a new , better one , will eventually rise in its place , even if it takes a couple generations to happen again , the world simply can not go on the way it had for the past 300 years , the fighting has to end , we ca n't do it forever . 
  xd come any time , i do n't think anyone will mind . 
  new one [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66j34w/this_is_what_european_parliament_would_look_like/ ) , should explain everything . 
  fair . 
  i 've fixed it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66j34w/this_is_what_european_parliament_would_look_like/ ) . 
  sorry about that , it works for a minute and then just flops . 
  yea , let 's hope not , that 'll actually be the end of the eu ...

  if we elect le pen on sunday i 'm moving to sweden , straight up . 
  it 's true , out of any member the uk was in the best position as far as their national independence goes , they were able to dodge so much eu legislation that it 's honestly surprising that ukip had a case at all , i guess that 's why they made up figures . 
  love to see it , even if nothing happens this symbolic gesture means everything , knowing that someone out there cares is so meaningful . 
  if i were in chechnya , just knowing that anyone cared , no matter how far away , would mean the world to me , hell , i live in the us rn and it means alot to me to see people who care so much that they 'll go out in the streets and protest , i appreciate what they 're doing regardless of any subsequent action , or lack thereof , by the dutch and russian governments . 
  it 's a huge symbolic gesture that can not be understated . 
  but ukraine and moldova have actual democracies , even if they are n't the best . 
  ayyyy !, 
  the uk avoided nearly every major binding catch , the uk was already in a position of enormous power and freedom , and the uk just gave it up . 
  xd to be fair the heart was never really there , and besides , you threw yourself out , everyone wanted you to stay . 
  [ socialists and democrats babyyyyy ! ], 
  ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-5.63&amp;soc=-8.31 ) also , i absolutely adore votewatch.eu , i will be browsing it for hours now . 
  ~ ~ edit : now i can make cool shit to better visualise how parliament collectively thinks : [ how parliament voted on the `` equality between women and men in the eu in 2014-2015 '' resolution ] ( https://tools.wmflabs.org/parliamentdiagram/svgfiles/2017-04-20-14-30-22-293067-1511312864391323684.svg ) red-no , yellow-abstain , green-yes , grey-didn ' t vote , and black-absent . ~ ~, 
  gah , why is ireland so awesome most of the time . 
  hey , the pessimists are less than half even today , that 's something to smile about . 
  shoutout to poland for being jarringly far right and still loving the eu . 
  it might take longer though , i 've heard that it may take until 2022 to be completed . 
  the second one will be the uk 's exit from existence when it inevitably falls apart . 
  it 's charts like these that make me think that we need some sort of fact-based test of political knowledge before anyone can vote , but i do n't even know who would write it . 
  well duh , you would n't be *** great *** britain if you were to , oh , i do n't know , leave the single largest free trade area in the world , could never happen . 
  should we tell them ? 
  russia would never do that , putin is heartless and cruel , he has no regard for any russian citizen , only the oligarchs to whom he answers . 
  he would be overthrown if he did n't have such a tight grip on the media , he has a choke-hold over the popular opinion and its sickening . 
   i 'm doing my bit to help that end in june . 
  ~_~ what does that mean ? 
  ok ... it 's still cute ~ ~ and means nothing to me ~ ~ . 
  xd edit : scratch that , it means [ nothing different than a regular salute . ], 
   the men are held in secret prisons and tortured into giving up the names and contact information of other gays living in the area . 
  russia , or *** someone *** needs to occupy chechnya and find these camps now before more than three people die , this is barbaric , i 'm a paragraph in and i could cry . 
  perhaps armenia invades a hypothetical civil warring turkey to take back that sweet sweet ararat . 
  careful , do n't cut yourself on your edge . 
   plus that whole rrg thing seems scary . 
  bruh . 
  that 's what wet dreams are ... a left wing coalition in the bundestag ... 
  ew , get out of me . 
  yea , i 'm just hoping that macron gets in and kicks some ass somehow . 
  noone does that ... 
  not gon na lie , i am so happy that people actually use those words . 
  mali = world power, 
  that moment when you compare the eu to hitler . 
  that sounds like a fun job tbh . 
  it is reigns true for anyone really , but macron is no outsider populist , he 's a banker , centrist , nothing to special , if m\u00e9lenchon wins and flops , the electorate will be inclined to associate his failures with a relatively extreme and populist candidate , and some will associate it with his far-leftedness , though this probably wo n't be much of a boost for her , most likely that would propel les r\u00e9publicains to the presidency , but i digress : le pen this looses her appeal as an extreme populist candidate . 
  so if macron ca n't be a truly spectacular president then all of a sudden the extremes start to look like they are the only way to generate real change , and the nightmare scenario of m\u00e9lenchon v. le pen is now much more likely . 
  \u00bf partido popular es neoliberal ? 
  : / not sure how i feel about this . 
  that is true , his effectiveness will depend pretty heavily on the legislature , but i 'm just saying that if he ca n't knock this out of the park , le pen could come back even stronger next time , and then it 's the end of europe as we know it ... no pressure tho . 
  is that a person saluting , that 's so fucking cute , oml . 
  sino = chinese they have the same meaning , for example : the [ sino-soviet split ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sino-soviet_split ) was the deterioration of chinese and russian ( soviet ) relations beginning in the 60s .
