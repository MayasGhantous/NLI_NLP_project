  [ this article is very informative . ], 
  ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/jean-luc-melenchon-for-a-european-revolution/ ) he wants to give parliament more power and will refuse giving bussles any more power , and i 'm quoting m\u00e9lenchon here , `` so long as the power does not reside in the hands of the european parliament . '', 
  so that 's his biggest thing , which is good , if i 'm not mistaken , that is prettymuch the # 1 complaint ever . 
  to be perfectly honest he might be better off drafting a whole new treaty rather than amending the current ones . 
  and i guess his little book is online , however the link to the book in the article to the party of the left 's website does n't work , just a 404 error . 
  [ perhaps this was the book they were referring to . 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/programme-insoumise-candidat-jean-luc-m\u00e9lenchon-ebook/dp/b01mxuy4wm/ref=asap_bc?ie=utf8 ) it has a little over the number of pages stated in the article , but i doubt the books are all uniform . 
  unfortunately for you though , this book is in french , i suppose you could look for the version somewhere online . 
  mmmmm , kindof , he plans to use a potential frexit to push reform , and he 's just crazy enough to do it too . 
  xd he wants to re-negotiate several eu treaties . 
  :p good idea . 
  noted . 
  meh , i see what you mean . 
  edit : i got rid of it . 
  no shit . 
  coming from the country that orgasms at the mere mention of the word : `` la\u00efcit\u00e9 '' . 
  point being : atleast france has done enough , it 's time to help others . 
  the ** ` murican ** kind, 
  ... wait , you 're bulgarian , how is the current condition worse than before ? 
  when were you born ? 
  f ^ e ^ e ^ l ^ s ^ g ^ o ^ o ^ d ^ m ^ a ^ n, 
  that 's ... too cute . 
  crimea is so democratic that it makes me wet . 
  no , a parliamentary republic ( similar to germany mind you ) is my dream , and that 's what he 's campaigning for , he also wants to lower the voting age to 16 ( another dream policy of mine ) , and enshrine abortion rights into the constitution among other things , i do n't want a new republic for the sake of a new republic . 
  ah , yes , beautiful nethermarklanden . 
  idk , there 's this croatian kid in my spanish class and he 's astonished at how mush croatian i know , little does he know that i 'm really good at polish , russian , and ukrainian . 
  are you serious ? 
  there is no way they tied a giant tie around a fucking colosseum . 
  lmao , the downsides of being far-right and gay . 
  or ... m\u00e9lenchon v. le pen ? 
  that 'd be wacky . 
  i was hamon until the first debate , then m\u00e9lenchon 's proposed sixth republic completely swayed me to him , and from the polls it appears that i am not the only one . 
  lol , i know . 
  well , i wouldnt be so fast to criticise him , if he wins somehow and then is unable to fulfill , that 's when he deserves criticism . 
  yea , you should see him in the debates , he 's really good . 
  i 've been waiting for this . 
  edit : he should have eloborated on m\u00e9lenchon , `` anti-eu '' is a huge generalisation and is only half-accurate at that . 
  shoutout to me for learning portuguese for the sole purpose of being prepared in these situations : \u00f5l\u00e3 , \u00bf c\u00f5m\u00f5 v\u00e3i \u00bf ( but i really do know portuguese ), 
  that 's the sickest burn of all time . 
  true , were *** famous *** . 
  atleast i 'm invested in politics , not everyone is , and that 's fine , but those who are n't need to do some serious research before voting . 
  well , yea , but now erdo\u011fan will be able to do it legally . 
  i dunno , a parliamentary republic sounds bad-ass , i 'm not the biggest fan of a strong executive branch . 
  why you got ta break my heart @turkey ? 
  m\u00e9lenchon definitely pays them . 
  currently in the us , in new england it 's a miserably warm 24 ^ ( \u00b0 c ) . 
  ( i like it cold . ), 
  the us will soon be finding itself short one military ally , so i doubt they 'll have objections . 
  ... imma be honest ... 
  i think about the netherlands ** way ** more than i think about spain ... and italy too . 
  i find myself occupied with france ( duh , i 'm french ) , germany , the netherlands , and sweden . 
  edit : polish and hungarian politics give me anxiety , but i find myself sucked into reading about them anyway . 
  you have that backwards , like trump she attracts the less educated part of the population and exploits their igorace to contrary evidence , their fear , and their vulnerability . 
  ah , i guess that should have been obvious . 
  relax , he just wants to be more like america , after all , nothing says freedom like government-sanctioned killing !, 
  ( and a powerful executive branch does n't hurt . ), 
  kid just shit his pants . 
  vive ... uh ... * le * france ? 
  ^ ( do n't think i did n't notice the misgendering of france , you heathens . ), 
  i 'm * shocked * ** shocked ** i tell you !!, 
  let 's just take a moment to admire this vexillological masterpiece . 
  *** death penalty auto-legalises ***, 
  your username is questionable at best . 
  why 'd you drop the `` a '' then ? 
  u mean west ? 
  lol or east greece . 
  bois , come to france . 
  th\u00f8se \u00e5re the h\u00e5rshest words i 've ever h\u00e6rd from \u00e5 d\u00e6ne . 
  pollution poinsons water  chiese govt receives blame for toxic water  china implodes, 
  i could only have 30 options and the wikipedia page i used for the number of speakers set the limit at 50 million , a surprisingly close-to-thirty number . 
  i 'd go so far as to say that given the current number of transports we could do it right now , the us only used five , so the eu could easily replicate or exceed the rate at which the us shuttled troops to mali . 
  what says that the eu does n't have the ability , in theory , to do what the us did ? 
  just because in one conflict france relied on the us to move most of their troops does n't mean that it 's not possible for the eu to do the same thing . 
  because a majority were european , if the eu had to do it by itself it could , it just did n't in this case . 
  i mean , i have to agree , by 2040 china is likely to have poisoned all of its water , meaning that the chinese government will be taking the blame for it , inevitably causing unrest at the very least . 
  it would appear that [ the us in particular provided a remarkably large amount of help in transporting troops and equipment . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval#allied_nations ) ( this does n't mean that the eu is n't capable of transporting their own troops , however . ), 
   you need to measure sorties though , huh ? 
  i 'd be hesitant in joking any sort of union/bloc with china ... unless you meant the republic . 
  according to stratfor [ 16 out of the 26 transports came from eu nations ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/styles/stratfor_full/public/main/images/world_mali_airlift_support.jpg?itok=uzjmmege ) ( excluding the uk ) . 
  [ here 's the full article too . ], 
  ( https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/geopolitics-airlift-support-africa ), 
  that 's not even true , [ france has the most powerful military in the eu regardless of weather you count the uk or not ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) , but germany is also very powerful , plus ontop of france and germany there are ** 25 ** other militaries of varying strength . 
  well duh , even without the uk the eu has a gargantuan military , economy , and population . 
  leave it to finland to be fucking awesome !, 
  yay !, 
  germany loves us !, 
  thanks , i know this website already , i love it . 
  this poll only includes languages with 50 million or more speakers, 
  yea , the muslim thing is n't a hit with alot of the citizens . 
  and while it may be easier to stop migrants in turkey , it 's also mere kilometres away from daesh , and bordering a country in civil war , meaning that the eu would have to take stronger action , pulling it ** deep ** into a conflict with no end in sight . 
  also , another caveat is the pkk , and kurds in general , the eu probably does n't want to have to legislate on that either . 
  yea , the eu situation will likely get worse then . 
  honestly , yukey would be a cool member to have . 
  another problem for turkey is even if it were the freest country in the world , it 's so close to so many conflict zones that the eu might be weary of bordering iraq and syria in particular . 
  there 's also the armenian genocide issue and the potential for a greek veto . 
  i see that , hopefully the referendum is rejected , that would alleviate some of the worry in the eu . 
  as for the past i really do n't know enough to have an explanation for that . 
  well that 's my concern , presidents do n't * usually * last forever , but erdo\u011fan probably plans to stay in office for a looong time . 
  never , i was just just think about portuguese colonies across all time periods .
