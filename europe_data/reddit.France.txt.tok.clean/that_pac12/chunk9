  i just thought i 'd throw it in there for anyone who did n't know . 
  i would gladly , europe is a continent ripe for federation , and as the rest of the world becomes more democratic and modernised more nations can join , eventually the world will become so inerconnected that we can finally unite , this is no short-term project ofcourse . 
  now just put brazil on there and you 're all set . 
  but again , why ? 
  what future does that hold ? 
  humanity ca n't live divided into arbitrary countries forever , it 's time for us to grow up . 
  that is decisive and wrong , what do you propose the future looks like for europe then ? 
  hmm ? 
  you think europe just just going to perpetually sit in isolation from itself forever ? 
  well , given the current situation in turkey , my `` widespread opinion '' is not the main thing keeping turkey out of the west . 
  yea , idk bru . 
  i know it 's my own personal view , this has even established , i do n't understand then why my personal view is such a problem . 
  i know armenia is in asia , and i know turkey has land in europe , but i can think whatever i want because the term continent is so vague ( especially in europe 's case ) . 
  edit : have i mentioned that despite being mostly in asia i consider a turkey european ( politically ) , because at do , and i want to make that clear . 
  well it 's not my fault that turkey just seems `` asian '' . 
  i never said it was fact , just how i think of it . 
  me too . 
  alright , fair enough . 
  the way you said that previous thing was very ominous , i get worried for a second . 
  wait who do you think i am , and who are you ? 
  will be sure to do that . 
  ah yes , good ol' ` murican freedom \u2122, 
  rip spanish empre , us killed it . 
  yea , the pero at the beginning threw me off , at first i thought it was a language spoken in europe . 
  exactly . 
  likely there are , i 'd imagine that polyglots are highly valued in the european union . 
  i 'm super into european languages , i have a few years experience in spanish , portuguese , italian , german , swedish , norwegian , polish , ukrainian , russian , greek and some kazakh . 
  i know japanese ( albeit poorly ) and i really want to speak cantonese but ca n't find any programs to learn it with , and i do n't live near any cantonese-speaking area . 
  i also really want to learn afrikaans . 
  yea , i do n't know filipino . 
  xd it 's cool though . 
  i can speak japanese , but i 'm so bad it 's not even funny . 
  lol , np , 
  muah, 
  alright . 
  ... but you know english . 
  this is only for languages with over 50 million speakers . 
  sorry for not clarifying . 
  no , i 'm going to say no . 
  this is only for languages with over 50 million speakers . 
  sorry for not clarifying . 
  this poll is only for languages with over 50 million speakers . 
  new and improved , much better than the last . 
  yea , i wish that there was a way to see the overlap , i could n't just make this a one-answer poll . 
  yea , i know . 
  :p sorry about that, 
  shit . 
  should i start a second poll with polish , and an `` other '' option ? 
  ( along with fixing other various typos and mistakes ? 
  ... do you mean like r/italy for italian , etc. ? 
  i was referring to physical environments , but that works just as well i suppose . 
  latin is used to identify species across languages and such , however most are n't fluent in latin , english and french are the main languages today . 
  latin is prettymuch dead as a lingua franca or otherwise outside of vatican city . 
  it does n't have over 50 million speakers . 
  lol, 
  lol , rip denamrk, 
  he 's the best remaining option , as i said macron is no longer an option for me , hamon wo n't win , even if i think he ' she best option , fillon wo n't win , and i do n't like kids politics anyway , and i definitely do n't like marine le pen . 
  all the other minor candidates not win either . 
  it does n't have over 50 million speakers . 
  god . 
  i knew that too , i do n't know what possessed me to do that . 
  yea , i wish i could go back and edit . 
  that is true , i wish i could go back and edit , there are a few typos and formatting issues i would like to change . 
  yea , i probably should have clarified , i toyed with combining all languages in china into one , but decided against it ( for good reason ) . 
  and you 're completely correct both of you 're examples are far more recognisable than what i used , and all of my very limited knowledge of mandarin comes from cantonese . 
  it 's not just your average intelligence probe when it comes to encryption , once a government has the right to break encrytion locks , they can see ** anything ** and ** everything ** they want to see , encryption is so much more than skimming through a general rundown of the e-mails you send and receive . 
  breaking encryption means that you have no form of protection . 
  recently the us government had tried to break into a terrorist 's iphone and apple would n't give up the data . 
  it 's just so alarming to me because while it would be bad enough to give any government this power , what happens when a government is hacked , as is commonplace ? 
  if the government was storing extensive information about any of its citizens , now every facet those citizens is known to whoever hacked the government . 
  maybe it 's a worst-case scenario , but i 'd rather have it not even be a possibility . 
  yea . 
  i only know if one person who 's taking one , they 're taking mandarin , so good for them , but they 're not very accessible or well-known either . 
  the problem is that you really have to want to learn the language rather than having it be required . 
  edit : which i guess is n't always a problem , but america would be much better off with more extensive foreign language education . 
  that 's a little odd , i thought about it for a second and decided that if you really do n't know it , you can just google it . 
  what is the language in question here ? 
  well atleast you do n't deny that evolution is real . 
  no , some schools do latin , but that 's about it , and i live in massachusetts , so it 's one of the better states when it comes to language education ( and education in general ) . 
  it is possible for you to take an online class for other languages i think , but i 'm not sure how that works or how effective it even is . 
  lucky , currently living in anerica , in high school you only need two years of either french or spanish to graduate . 
  damn , always one typo . 
  sorry about that , that 's really bothersome . 
  lmao , i wish i had germa in school , i only take french and spanish . 
  ( i already know french , so easy a babyyyyyy . ), 
  ayyyyy , shoutout to the swahili speaker . 
  i suppose it 's you 're call , if you can understand the german and they can understand you , then i guess . 
  but , fundamentally you ca n't speak german , because , well , you 're speaking dutch not german . 
  i 'd say a general rule of thumb is : if you were dropped in an environment right now where only that language was spoken , could you affectively communicate with those around you . 
  so , not necessarily fluent , but good enough to be able to gather and share a significant amount of information . 
  then why am i here ? 
  :o i just blew your mind, 
  well , the us could also remain a strong ally aswell , two superpowers of that stature alligned could have almost unchecked power . 
  and , while , sure , the eu is to keep france and germany form going to war , it also keeps the rest of europe at peace too . 
  while france and germany are by far the biggest offenders , all european nations outside the eu have the capacity to go to war with eachother , ideally they could n't , even if they wanted too . 
  `` pseudo-culture '' so ... combining several cultures makes the resulting culture fake ? 
  are you aware that cultures have been influencing eachother for the entirety of human history ? 
  by your logic the only true cultures that exist are tribes in the amazon rainforest . 
  yea , but said if it 's christian , it 's european . 
  ideally hamon would win , but since that wo n't happen i 'm kindof hoping for a m\u00e9lenchon win , even if i only half-agree with him .
