and then complain about big eu who impose laws on european countries ... 
  it 's the same in france and it 's quite sad ... 
  wait what ? 
  since when is norway on the coins ? 
   if germany were to reign the pacifist outlook that 's one of the reason . 
  i 'm not sure germnay is ready to do that . 
  the second one is that projection of military power is the highest power a country has . 
  to have 2 different countries joining in a sort of single army would mean a huge level of integration from this 2 countries . 
  which is not something germany and france have at the moment , and i 'm not seing it happening in the near futur either ;, 
  to be fair , ch\u00e8ques are still a big thing in france . 
  according to wikipedia , it was first named cordoa , as an hommage to cordoba . 
  during the revolution the name was changed to cordes la montagne . 
  and in 1993 the name was again changed to cordes sur ciel following a 1947 novel about the `` sea of clouds '' that surrounds the village . 
  it sounds like most of the scenes will happen on the surface of mars , so less opportunities to fuck up the physics parts . 
  you 'll just have to wait until the strikes are over though :p, 
  no , they do n't just need a small office in the eu . 
  in order to be able to sell insurances in the eu , the eu company will have to comply with [ the eu regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solvency_ii_directive_2009 ) . 
  so the lloyd 's will have to comply with uk regulations in the uk but also divert funds in the eu company to comply there too . 
  in the case of a total loss of the eu passport ( depending on the brexit negotiations ) they 'll have to hold on to funds both in the uk and in eu . 
  so is every welfare system . 
  sorry , i was using the french meaning for liberal . 
  for us liberal is used in the economical meaning : people who want fewer intervention from the state in the economy , less welfare state etc. . . 
  he is against the free market side of the current eu . 
  he is anti-current-eu : ultra liberal . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.bienici.com/annonce/vente/najac/maison/7pieces/ag390109-97002493?camera=15_1.9722782_44.220431&amp;q=%2frecherche%2fachat%2fparis-75000%2f2-pieces-et-plus%3fprix-max%3d300000%26surface-min%3d40%26tri%3dpertinence-desc%26camera%3d15_1.9726842_44.2192717 ) is the only one i could find online . 
  it 's 170m \u00b2 ( so a bit more than 1 800sq ft ) with a garden and some woods ( 5 200m \u00b2 ) for 85 000 $ . 
  i do n't know if it has a view on the castle though . 
  edit : more here : https://www.leboncoin.fr/ventes_immobilieres/offres/ile_de_france/occasions/?th=1&amp;location=najac%2012270&amp;parrot=0, 
   if that 's the way it is going to be used , then why not completely replace it with mrls ? 
  the cost i guess . 
  one rocket must be at least as expensive as the whole load-out of a caesar . 
  well , a loan is supposed to be repaid so whom it comes from is not really a problem , as long as its a real one . 
  you just have to make sure that it is repaid in full and not a donation in disguise . 
  wait , tsa is a private organisation ? 
  a lot of farmland and forests . 
  but it 's only true for the president . 
  for all other elections , including les legislatives which are at least as important , more parties are represented . 
  sadly yes . 
  a lot of people who used to vote for the ps or the communists now vote fn because she is promising everything and it 's opposite , including better welfare and jobs . 
  that 's what they want you to believe !, 
  yeah , it was a very popular way to get money for your political party : you pay people from your elected position ( mayor of paris for exemple ) but instead of working for you , they work pour your party . 
  will they still continue to brew beer under shakira law ? 
  i mean , we are seeing american conservatives willing to work with russia !, 
  it 's a new day and age my friends !, 
  for * 1 $ symbolique * !, 
  attention is given to it because it could be case study on how this kind of attack is set up and how it can work . 
  i would guess their ability to weight on the political decisions concerning their area of work . 
  they might have to start anew on the lobbying side . 
  yeah !, 
  esn sea battle is just that : 2/3000 students and erasmus students on a booze cruise from stockholm to tallinn !, 
  that was so awesome !, 
   she will likely face macron in the second round . 
  it 's really too early to say . 
  macron support is really volatile . 
  and ( in my opinion ) he is still trying too much to balance between the right and the left which makes his project unreadable for the moment . 
  honestly this is a really weird election : - 6 month ago jupp\u00e9 was the likely candidate for the right . 
  - 4 month ago hollande was still a likely candidate for the left . 
  - 2 month ago fillon was the next president and he 's now the third man in the race . 
  - 1 month ago valls was the likely candidate for the left . 
  there is no saying what 's gon na happen next . 
  in paris it ` es really good . 
  - there are more than 300 000 yearly subscribers . 
  - it still is used by a lot of people , much more than anticipated so they had to work on the logistics to keep all stations supplied and all bikes workable . 
  - the system is pretty reliable . 
  but the geography of the city makes it so some sector lack bikes at key hours : it 's damn near impossible to find a bike around 2am in the pubs locations . 
  - the yearly subscription is 30 $ . 
  afterwards every time you take a bike you have 30 minutes for free , then it 's 0,50 $ for 30 minutes . 
  but you can just use your bike for 30 minutes , put it back , wait 5 minutes and take another one for another free 30 minutes . 
  all in all it 's pretty great , we are starting to have more and more bicycle lane , it 's cheap , it 's reliable and it 's awesome to bike by the seine in the summer :d, 
  do n't listen these thieving swiss , raclette is rightful french cheese !, 
  i guess so  it also has to be noted that the canard encha\u00eene was founded in 1915 and does n't have any adds in it and never had any . 
  le canard encha\u00een\u00e9 is nothing like the onion ... 
  it 's a real newspaper , printing real articles . 
  they just joke about what they write , but it is not satire . 
  73 $ a month or [ 803 $ a year ] ( http://www.navigo.fr/titres/le-forfait-navigo-annuel-presentation/ ) for the whole of [ ile de france ] ( http://www.ratp.fr/plan-interactif/ ) . 
  pretty good price i 'd say . 
  from this website : http://vision-macron.fr/la-transition-energetique/ ( in french , sorry ) , he says he sees the energetic transition ( going from fossil fuel and nuclear power to more renewable energies ) as an economical opportunity . 
  he firmly believes global warming is a thing ( i do n't know of any french mainstream politician denying it though ) . 
  no , hamon has said the he would repeal parts of the law , not all of it . 
  he is very much from the establishment : science po paris then l'ena then inspecteur des finances and finally banker . 
  you ca n't get much more establishment . 
  he 's very much a product of the french system what he is not is a product of the french political system . 
  he started being really invested in politics at a national level in 2010 . 
  most of the other candidates have been part of it for at least a few decades . 
  also he defines himself as being free from the dogmas of the established political parties : he 's supposedly open to what he sees as good ideas from the right or the left side of the political spectrum . 
  he 's not anti-establishment , he does n't want to destroy l'ena or create a 6th republic , but he 's also not a real part of the political establishment either . 
  he seems to be something in between . 
  we never left nato . 
  we left it 's integrated command . 
  but they have to chamber the round first . 
  about watches and cigars ? 
  if that 's the one , how does it even compare to sarkozy or balkany ? 
  cahusac : was ostracized and condemned . 
  mitterand : no idea . 
  d\u00e9sir : no idea . 
  royal : no idea . 
  it 's because only approved personnel are allowed inside the camp . 
  i mean , you ca n't enter a prison or any government building unannounced just like that , it 's the same here . 
  shhhhhhh , clean public transportation is communism !, 
  hips be upon her !,
