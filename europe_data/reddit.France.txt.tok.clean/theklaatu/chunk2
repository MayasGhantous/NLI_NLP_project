  yeah , i mean everyone knows it 's a satellite of the ottoman empire !, 
  did n't work at first ? 
  and then they stopped enforcing the rules and it did n't work anymore ? 
  at the time , the [ jewish agency for palestine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_agency_for_israel#jewish_agency_for_palestine_1929.e2.80.931948 ), 
   why should the baltics believe that france will send troops in case of a russian agression ? 
  that 's why we have troops on the ground there . 
  even if it 's just a regiment . 
  in case of an attack there will be french casualties and i do n't see the opinion saying `` meh , let 's not retaliate it was just a few dozen men '' after the shitstorm that happened after uzbin . 
   french navy to shrink by two major combatants in coming years due to replacements not on a 1:1 scale ( from 17 frigates and destroyers today , to 15 in future years ) that is sadly true . 
  but on the other hand , our aircraft carrier is catobar , which beside allowing for other planes that the f35b , allows us to launch [ hawkeyes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_e-2_hawkeye ) . 
   french air force lacks any kind of istar you mean appart from any fighter equipped with a [ pod reco ng ( link in french ) ] ( http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/pod-reco-ng ) or one of the [ reapers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_atomics_mq-9_reaper ) or any spy satellite ? 
   and sigint aircraft in its inventory the [ c-160 gabriel ( in french ) ] ( http://www.avionslegendaires.net/avion-militaire/transall-c-160g-gabriel/ ) would like a word with you  i 'm not saying the french armed forces are without any problems , but it 's looking better , 
  you are confusing censoring views , and outlawing outright lies . 
  one of the best movie in history : [ dikkenek !, 
  he is euphoric , not because of a phony god 's blessing , but because of his own he is enlightened by his own intelligence :d, 
   also ; guyane please . 
  what 's going on ? 
  lower standards of living , huge problems with illegal gold prospectors from surroundings countries . 
  nope abroad : afghanistan , djibouti saoudi arabia , somalian waters , mali , car etc. . . 
  gas freezes around minus 60 ( i think ) so it could just be the frozen gas inside the tube itself . 
   sorry for another question but i always thought gign were comparable to the sas , navy seals etc but do they only operate internally in france or do they also act as french special forces abroad ? 
  gign is the gendarmerie 's special unit . 
  they can operate in france ( mostly ) but can and will be called abroad if necessary . 
  their main job is hostage rescue ( out of heavy war zones which is handled by other special forces team ) . 
  our equivalent to the sas is the [ 1er rpima ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_marine_infantry_parachute_regiment ) . 
  they even have the same moto . 
  our equivalent to the navy seals are the [ commando de marine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commandos_marine ) . 
  gign operates abroad ... 
  they do not have the same training and thus role as the sas tough . 
  the french equivalent to the sas is the 1er rpima . 
   the gign is the elite unit of the gendarmerie so they only operate in france . 
  gign operates abroad . 
  not as much as usual french army units , but they do . 
  gign is a military force . 
  yeah , i prefer my trusted sources , russia today and sputnik news !, 
  it 's surprising how many people in the thread are repeating the exact same sentence about the un having no verified sources . 
  like almost word for word from 3/5 users . 
  i think it has better positioning in northern territories ( norway , sweden and finland ) and cities with taller buildings . 
  it is also the only positioning system independent from military organisations and from foreign powers who could jam or degrade service in certain areas for whatever reasons . 
  well , most of the banking heads of the word are anglos . 
  i mean , i 'm not racist of anything , but it 's weird that most of the most powerfull men of the word are anglo is n't it ? 
  we maybe should have a sign to distinguish them from other people , like '' '' `` anglo '' '' '' or something like that no ? 
  they were really big big buses . 
  you mean paying for it themselves via the taxes they pay living and working in the country ? 
  because you pay taxes for this access to education , whatever nationality you are . 
   the muslims living in france right now are not exactly trying their best to integrate . 
  he did say that all of them were not trying to integrate . 
  honestly with so much bullshit going around lately about refugees , muslims etc. . . when reading about something that crazy that i 've never heard about , i 'm all for asking for sources . 
  so thank you for providing them , and holy shit , i had now idea that could be a thing ... 
   makes me wonder if cut even really enjoy sex yes i do very much thank you . 
  your whole paragraph was quite a bunch of nonsense though . 
  and he said he would go away from politics after this mandate . 
  so he 's either paving his way to the private sector , or doing his job until the end and retiring peacefully !, 
  hips be upon her !, 
  sounds fun :d, 
   and considering hollande as a god ... hahaha !, 
  well , looking as he does and being with [ julie gayet ] ( https://www.google.fr/search?q=julie+gayet&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjyvaau7tzqahuhqxokhd7jd_kq_auicsgc&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=770 ) , for me he is indeed a god !, 
  what would have been the choice of the court had the previous life not been in a religious sect but a secular one ( if that makes any sens ) ? 
  well you still need male and female gametes so somewhere there is still a dad and a mum . 
   to the nearest starbucks on saturdays so she can get a hot cup of coffee but , handling money on shabbat is also forbidden ... 
  soon . 
  it 's really not that clear cut . 
  fillon has an extremely dividing social program which cuts him completely from center voters and some center right voters . 
  this opens quite a spot for macron and depending on what happens during this primary we 'll see how much of an impact can melanchon have . 
   what is happy childhood ? 
  in this context i would say :  childcare , paid parental leave and education, 
  no , they were targeted because they were jews . 
  it happened at a school , but the primary reason was because they were jews . 
  objective media is not possible . 
  you chose to cover a subject before another ? 
  not objective . 
  you use a certain type of worlds instead of others ? 
  not objective . 
  you chose which facts to put on top of your article and which to leave at the bottom ? 
  not objective . 
  you analyse an event ? 
  completely not objective . 
  you chose ? 
  not objective . 
  alaska might disagree . 
  yeah , with the objective of tracking who in iraq was watching said videos . 
  those videos were intended for iraq only and never had any propaganda objectives . 
  but yeah , the cia and soros control all the media , let 's watch rt !, 
  well , it 's a french base , in french territory . 
  it used to be a french military base and is still protected by the french military . 
  so yeah , in french . 
  he 's from the right , ex-ump , now les r\u00e9publicains . 
  jupp\u00e9 being more center right than sarkozy . 
  which is not that much center . 
  i have a group of friends from my erasmus with a swedish , a turkish , a czech , a german and i , a french guy . 
  we are often told that we sound like the beginning of a joke . 
  they 're not bad neighborhoods , but pretty dead for a tourist , and with bad service for public transportation ( especially the 15th ) . 
   it looks like a straight up nice vs bad neighborhood map . 
  for paris it clearly is . 
   lasting up to several seconds after the results of an election that 's being quite optimistic !, 
   maybe france should n't take millions of undocumented migrants then . 
  yeah , fucking tourists ... 
  yeah , i also heard about it . 
  people were going crazy on facebook about the eu wanting to ban frites and chips ... from the article it says that acrylamide is created when food is heated above 248 \u00b0 c. 
  i never cook my fries that high .
