a hardcore ** christ ** ian would follow the teachings of * christ * : love ( love thy neighbor ) , tolerance ( judge not , that ye be not judged ) and personal accountability ( thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ) . 
  what these people pratice is a reformed judaic fundamentalism . 
  all the nasty shit in the bible is in the old testament ( ie . 
  the torah plus a few books ) , and guess where those fundies get their lovely ideas ? 
  as gandhi put it : `` i like your christ . 
  i do not like your christians . 
  your christians are so unlike your christ . '', 
  before and after sanity . 
  nope , i 'm making the argument that pro-israeli elements are influencing immigration policies abroad to scare european jews into making their aliyah ... 
  subtle difference , but there it is . 
  and i think the israel government is more scared of a demographic change favoring arabs in israel than its relationships with european countries . 
  plus , i do n't see how massive immigration would hurt those relationships , unless we 're talking complete population replacement , which is an unlikely scenario in the near future . 
  the most likely scenario in case of a massive immigration catastrophy would be civil war and eventual partition along ethnic lines , as we 're seeing in ukraine . 
  that would take at least another two generations , and would hardly hurt israel at all . 
  who contrarily to you knows that ad hominem is n't a valid argument . 
  well , if we could stop massive immigration in europe i 'd say jewish people would be pretty safe . 
  problem is , no political party is willing to actually do any of that except for far right parties , and the most pro-israel politicians are also the most vocal pro-immigration ones . 
  you 'd almost think the israeli lobby * wants * jews to feel unsafe in europe ... got ta keep them in the ghetto * somehow * . 
  listening to some great jazz at my favorite parisian bar right now . 
  life is good . 
  most of what i 've read about the subject ( climate studies ) is very subjective , and what it really shows is how inadequate our current methods are to grasp the mechanics of a complex system like the climate where many processes are in a constant state of combined retroaction . 
  to clarify my position , i believe it is possible that human activities do have a clear impact on climate changes , especially in our modern age , but that it is far from being undisputably proven . 
  the quasi-religious fervor of climate change proponents , most of whom have very little scientific background , and even less critical skills , seems to be to be another expression of our all-too-human tendency for uncritical belief in a higher cause , and all-too-western self-mortification instincts . 
  please , historically it 's not that uncommon . 
  google the `` little ice age '' to see that it 's hardly the first time the climate varied by 1 \u00b0 c. 
  marseille is under water , while paris is left untouched . 
  consider me sold . 
  you 're showing me a variation that barely grazes +1 \u00b0 c over 150 years . 
  not that impressive . 
  it 's been saying that for 15 years now , and it 's always a few more years away . 
  you sound like the loons waiting for the rapture . 
  me too . 
  too bad none of the examples above apply . 
  according to ecologists , the floods are a result of the ever-elusive global warming punishing manking for using fossil fuels . 
  to each his religion . 
  i 'm surprised to see iceland lower than norway . 
  a country that can force its politicians to say `` fuck you ! '', 
  to international bankers and let the local ones fail without a bailout should be ** democracy number one for ever and ever , and can i get an a-men !!!, 
   as far as i 'm concerned , culture is best when reduced to a purely cosmetic feature . 
  culture is all-encompassing . 
  which is why you just ca n't see yours ( globalism ) , and why you 're willing to destroy everyone else 's . 
  a fish does n't see the sea . 
   it 's strange that you think we 'll be subject to anglo-saxon economic liberalism , when in fact the actual anglo-saxon component is the most unwilling the uk is n't leading globalism : the usa are . 
  is n't it `` strange '' that eu 's * lingua franca * is actually english ? 
  hint : no , it is n't . 
   because they are insignificant , hold no real power , and do not have the capacity to maintain their sovereignty on their own . 
  which is why to want to rip it from them ? 
  you remind me of something i read about taking 's people 's voice away , and then accusing them of having nothing to say . 
  there are other ways than this violence you 're advocating : alliances , * con * federations , defense treaties * \u00e0 la * nato . 
  a federal eu is just introducing a single point of failure through which we can be manipulated . 
   if there was no eu at all , there would be some sort of an us-dominated atlantic trade union the ironic thing is that this us-dominated atlantic trade union [ is about to be brought to us wholesale ] ( https://www.laquadrature.net/en/tafta ) by the very eu which , according to you , is supposed to be defending us from it . 
  you really are naive . 
   globalization is not a process that can be halted by ** being stubborn ** , and political integration closely follows in the footsteps economic globalization being stubborn ? 
  maintaining our sovereign rights , our culture and our independence is n't stubbornness , it 's called freedom . 
  economic globalization does not imply ideological lockstep , except when one country uses violence to impose an asymetric relationship on another . 
  the federal eu is the us 's trojan horse to impose its norms , legislation , and economic power on us . 
  norms and laws which * they * control . 
  the eu * could * , maybe , one day be made into a counterpower , but its current reality is the exact opposite . 
  wake up . 
   you do realize that all of these countries had to adapt their legislation to allow for freedom of movement and integration in the eea ? 
  yes , and this cooperation has benefited them because they could enter it * on their own terms * . 
  because they still have sovereignty . 
   hypothetically , do you really think switzerland would be allowed to become a theocratic dictatorship if the swiss wanted so ? 
  absurd hypotheses do not reinforce your point , they just make you look desperate . 
  as a more realistic possibility : if tomorrow the uk decided to reintroduce barriers to immigration and withdraw from the schengen area , do you think we could do anything to stop it ? 
  would we stop cooperating with them economically ? 
  of course not . 
  that 's the power of sovereignty . 
   you ca n't freeze time in the ( end of ) 20th century , and expect that kind of world order to persist forever . 
  you seem so sure that super-states are the way of the future . 
  but what if you were wrong ? 
  what if smaller , more efficient and interconnected polities were the real future of humanity ? 
  what if the state , in its current form , was really a relic of the past already being made obsolete by virtual networks , electronic currencies , free flow of information and direct local democracies ? 
  your super-states look like empires , and empires have short lifespans . 
  in an age of bio-engineering , robotics , computerization and local-manufacturing through 3d-printing , your future already looks obsolete . 
   it 's also a matter as to how you frame the question actually , it 's * predominantly * a matter of how you frame the question . 
  opinion polls are a mass-manipulation technique , nothing else . 
  beg the question , offer limited choices , frame things you want people to agree to in a positive light , do the opposite for things you want them to reject , ask simplified questions on complex matters ... the ways to tweak an opinion poll are as numerous as they are varied . 
  there are probably courses in communication schools on polling manipulation techniques , and even i use a few in the course of my work ( it ) to create a consensus on solutions i want to see implemented . 
  once you 've herded people in the direction you want to take them , publish the poll results , present it as `` the will of the people '' and * voil\u00e0 !, 
  * a happily pro-europe ( they never mention the `` federal '' part ) population . 
   i do n't think anyone is really pushing for imposing an `` european culture '' . 
  what exactly do you think `` multiculturalism '' is ? 
  it 's culture reduced to a tourist trifecta of food/costumes/architecture while everything else is global anglo-saxon social and economical liberalism . 
   the notion that a small country can somehow be truly sovereign and go its own way in the twenty-first century is a myth . 
  why ? 
  what is this strange notion that nations are obsolete ? 
  it is repeated * ad nauseam * , but what reason do we have to believe so ? 
  some of the countries that fare the best nowadays are some of the less integrated into the european super-state : uk , switzerland , norway , iceland . 
  apart from germany , which has always been able to dictate it ways to the european union as the biggest payer , everyone else is suffering from a depressed economy , crashing birth rates and lackluster dynamism . 
  smaller has often meant better , more agile , more responsive , more productive , more able to adapt and change to local problems . 
  bigger is cumbersome , more prone to corruption , resistant to change , paralyzed by competing interests . 
  cooperation between sovereign states might be a better option , but it is refused from the get-go by the `` eurol\u00e2tres '' , bent as they are on their religious conviction that the fractious ways of the past will be superceded by the glorious future of the european leviathan !, 
  they should remember that the giant goliath was felled by little david with a mere stone . 
    social democratic society would never work in a huge multicultural society like us . 
   there 's really no conclusive evidence to support that claim . 
  there 's actually plenty of evidence that people with different cultures feel no kinship to each other , that multicultural societies are less trusting than homogeneous ones , and that people vote predominantly according to ethnic affiliation . 
  there 's a reason why most multicultural states born from colonialism are run by barely-disguised dictatorships . 
  the human instinct is to cleave to the tribe . 
  nation-states are the most successful , time-proven way of getting large populations to work under a common leadership , and even those are most successful at improving their people 's happiness when limited to under 20 millions people .
