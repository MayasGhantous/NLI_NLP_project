  i see no upsides of your eu super-state except the military power necessary to bully smaller countries , at the expense of social and infrastructure spending , like the usa . 
  and even that could be made obsolete by nuclear power , smart drones and advanced robotics . 
  i say : smaller , leaner , more efficient is better . 
  it 's sad that this simple sentiment , still shared among most of the people in europe , is only ranked 7th as expressed on / r/europe . 
  it shows how unrepresentative most of the reddit userbase is , and how out of touch we are with the people , the reality of geopolitics , and the utter betrayal of our political , economical and media elite . 
  hell , no . 
  enfin , bon courage !, 
  no use , you 're transparent enough as it is . 
  and returning the `` no argument '' argument instead of answering it , nice !, 
  what 's for your next trick ? 
  perform for me , little monkey !, 
  and it 's admirable that a 7 months account , which only had 1 comment until 21 days ago expects me to think it is n't a nato troll . 
  especially when it 's been so rabidly defending the nato narrative for all that time , uses [ every dishonest rhetoric tactic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_art_of_being_right ) ever dreamed up by shopenhauer , and basically ressorts to shit-flinging when it ca n't back up its rhetoric . 
  so what now , flame war ? 
  sarcastic putdown ? 
  what do they teach you in cyber warfare , exactly ? 
  please demonstrate . 
  and truthdig , ron paul institute , globalresearch.ca , antiwar.com , humanrightsinvestigations.org , techdirt.com ... 
  i keep my sources diverse and listen to all sides . 
  what about you , do you ever read something other than the nyt , bbc and wsj ? 
  any alternative media ? 
  at all ? 
  good sheep , keep bleating . 
   please tell me which countries in your list eu or nato installed `` client states and regimes '' my list described the states under past or current attack for their link to russia , so your question is invalid . 
  but if you want to know about nato ( really us ) client regimes , where do i start ? 
  serbia-herzegovina , kosovo , montenegro , afghanistan , iraq , and this in just the last 25 years . 
  i 'd add lybia , but the destruction was so total there that what 's left is n't even worth installing a regime for . 
  going back even further , every country in central and south america except venezuela , the whole fucking eu now that france has joined nato under the traitor sarkozy , and last but not least , the whole arabian peninsula , where we are currently helping the saudis massacre the paltry shia opposition to their puppet regime in yemen . 
  and i 'm not even talking about indonesia , japan , taiwan , or the myriad of pacific mini-states which made the bulk of the risible `` coalition of the willing '' during the last iraq war . 
   provide example of nato/eu weapon sales to ukraine . 
  ue : http://rt.com/news/240705-ukraine-poroshenko-weapons-europe/ and our uae allies : http://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-president-meets-u-a-e-officials-to-secure-weapons-purchase-1424788248  so each and every russian in ukraine is it war with kiev ? 
  the kiev army is shelling civilians , so it would appear so , at least from kiev 's point of view . 
  [ this ] ( http://rt.com/news/tymoshenko-calls-destroy-russia-917/ ) probably also explains it . 
  and this not even mentioning [ the activities of the regime against its opposants behind the war zone ] ( http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2015/04/16/the-murderers-of-kiev/ ) .

  that last link was for you , btw . 
  i 've been on reddit for 9 years , bozzo . 
  i think i know where i come from , and my posting history is there to confirm it . 
  idiot . 
  and if you think nato 's anything else but the usa 's tool , or that the kiev regime gives a shit about those `` restrictions '' on eu grants , or that the eu is in any way enforcing them , or that weapon sales are transparent ... 
  i have a nice parisian beachfront property too sell to you ... cheap !, 
  eu is pro-nato , which by definition and by historical account makes it pro-war , pro-installment of client states and regimes , and anti-russia ( south ossetia , serbia , syria , ukraine ) . 
  and the war in ukraine is backed by nato/eu to the hilt , with financial grants , military advisers , weapon sales , etc. 
  and let 's not forget that it 's a war instigated by kiev against the russian minority of ukraine , when they rebelled against the coup d'\u00e9tat and anti-russian rhetoric of the current regime . 
  so literally everything you 've said is false . 
  we 're at * war * , or so close it does n't make a difference . 
  what else could it be ? 
  the whole thing is about controlling the narrative : popular rebellion against the kremlin thugs , or nato-controlled * coup d'\u00e9tat * supported by neo-nazis . 
  the truth , if there is any chance to ever get to it , is probably some of the worst of both : geopolitics are n't for the faint of heart . 
  but / r/europe is populated by such cheerleaders for nato , i just ca n't help pricking your circlejerk-balloon with the needle of reality , sometime . 
  because russian `` propaganda '' , like ours , and like all good lies , is made of half-truths : yes , we ( nato ) interfered with the maidan protests ; yes , we gave support to the far-right extremists ; yes , the whole process was highjacked by adventurers and war-profiteers who are now running ukraine into the ground , with our blessing . 
  and yes , the former president was a russian puppet ; yes , he was corrupt ; yes , the maidan protests , at least in the beginnings , were an honest pro-europe political movement . 
  but it 's all water under the bridge now . 
  all that 's left are lies , war and death . 
  enjoy applauding it from the stands , and cheering on `` your '' team . 
   debunking most russian propaganda is that what we call `` putting out our own propaganda '' , now ? 
  fived . 
  actually , it 's history you ca n't isolate from politics . 
  history has always been used to justify the status quo , and is therefore the viewpoint of the current elite . 
  change the elite , change history . 
  i only take gold . 
  ca n't trust those banks . 
  when all western media is parroting nato propaganda , i really have a hard time seeing the qualitative difference between a kremlin-backed source and a washington-backed one . 
  i read * all * propaganda and make up my own mind . 
  otoh , the links showing nato engages in cyber-trolling are techdirt.com and the guardian . 
  am i supposed to believe the kremlin controls these , too ? 
  you read that wrong : if other countries have started to use internet `` trolls '' , it is because the usa * initiated the practice * ( all documented in the article , too ) . 
  counter-psyops is just common sense when you are daily defamed by thousands of nato agents . 
  all wars are information wars , nowadays . 
  he has been pushing for war on every front for the past 25 years , but yeah , what a swell guy : bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , south ossetia , the gaza war , lybia , syria , now ukraine and iran ... what a humanitarian !, 
  add to this his unconditional support of polanski and strauss-kahn in their judicial `` persecution '' , and we have a candidate for sainthood right there !, 
  france : [ marcia baila - les rita mitsouko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6fvlfogto8 ), 
  [ sure the kremlin employs trolls , but uncle sam has 50x more ] ( http://russia-insider.com/en/western-hypocrisy-shaping-public-opinion-through-social-media-manipulation/5235 ), 
  that logic is yours . 
  it even has a name . 
  it 's called the strawman fallacy . 
  [ ahem ... ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6qxnso6fbus/vhcodfzciai/aaaaaaaaye8/28i1snymntm/s1600/oyspocyhtb0.jpg ), 
  honestly , i 'm not sure it will make much of a difference . 
  most french people care nothing for geopolitics , and fn supporters , being nationalists , actually respect and admire putin for `` sticking it to the us '' and defending his country 's interests . 
  this is n't the cold war era anymore , when anti-communism made everyone hate soviet russia . 
  in today 's world , russia looks more and more like an ally for all european nationalists who see the ue as the tool of us hegemony . 
   join or die . 
  and people wonder why anti-european parties are on the rise . 
  smh, 
   national is nazism right there with you . 
  [ look at those disgusting nationalists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpxv4aff3ia ) . 
  turns the stomach , does n't it ? 
  all hail putin , shitlord extraordinaire and divine tzar of mother russia , ally supreme of american god-emperor trump , may his wall rise ever higher and his golden haircrown never fail !!!, 
  down with leftist scum !, 
  yeah , europeans who want to stay europeans , who wants * that * ? 
  let us all disappear in a mass of third world immigrants , to whom we 'll teach our wonderful civic duties before quietly committing ethnic suicide . 
  i mean , how could they * not * be enthralled about keeping alive a civilization they feel no kinship to ? 
  of * course * they 'll become like europeans and keep alive our values and customs !, 
  what a * fan-tas-tic * idea !, 
  [ well , that escaladed quickly . 
  i 'm still awaiting excuses for j.k.rowling , but wodehouse is certainly praiseworthy . 
  same thing with a moroccan colleague . 
  their family pool their money to send them to turkey . 
  from there , it 's either isis or europe . 
  or both .
