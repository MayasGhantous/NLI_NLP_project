  even if some daesh soldiers were drafted , they were so in iraq/syria . 
  this discussion therefore does n't apply to them . 
  europeans , by blood or paper , who joined daesh did so voluntarily . 
  when they come back , we should arrest them , try them in a military tribunal , bring them to the prison yard , and hang them for treason . 
  simple , effective , and legal in france once we reinstitute the death penalty for treason , recently abrogated by sarkozy ( but let 's not go there ) . 
   you do know there were several thousands fsa fighters helping the ypg-led coalition against daesh try [ 300 ] ( https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/reportsfeatures/564212-fsa-fighting-alongside-kobane-kurds ) . 
   they bled and died like everyone else against the daesh nazis . 
  [ yet most of the help we 've sent them for years now end up in jihadi hands ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/middleeast/jihadists-receiving-most-arms-sent-to-syrian-rebels.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp; ) . 
   as for the turks , they do their own thing , independantly [ yeah , you can say that again ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/turkey-saudi-arabia-syria-rebels-pact_n_7232750.html ) . 
  very bad analogy . 
  autria-hungary troops were drafted . 
  daesh troops are mostly volunteers . 
  i agree , and i really put this to the credit of the french people , whatever their origins . 
  but it does n't change the fact that a fringe of young men are getting radicalized , and that a rising percentage of french autochtones are getting more and more incensed by islamist attacks . 
  racial tensions are rising , and adding hundreds of thousands of migrants to the situation is like pouring oil onto the fire . 
  muslims can , and do integrate , when two sets of conditions are present : 1 . their host country can offer jobs , social elevation perspectives and a better life . 
  young men languishing in the `` cit\u00e9s '' with no hope of escaping poverty are prime fodder for recruiters into the takfiri sectarian ideology . 
  2 . the immigrants ' numbers are not so extreme that the original inhabitants suffer from cultural shock and a feeling of dispossession , making them amenable to accepting the foreigners into their social and economic circles . 
  lack one or the other , and you create ethnic ghettos which are hostile to their host country , and a perfect breeding ground for civil unrest and worse . 
  be honest , which situation looks more like france in the last 10 years ? 
  both communities are reaching the end of their rope , because neither economic opportunities nor manageable numbers are present . 
  i know an increasing number of people determined to vote fn in the next elections , and i really ca n't blame them when i see the direction our country is taking . 
  i do not think it will solve anything ( i do n't trust mlp further than i could kick her flabby ass ) , but the lack of political vision from our `` elites '' is a one-way street to civil war . 
   are all the people who fought for daesh evil ? 
  who cares ? 
  they fight for the enemy , therefore they 're traitors , and traitors get shot . 
   or let the entire muslim community be scapegoated , then le pen is pretty much guaranteed to win . 
  then it 's pretty much a given . 
  the media have done nothing but scapegoat muslims in the last few years . 
  sad thing is , the only people i know of who have died in the attacks are muslims . 
  i 'm anti mass immigration , because i 'm anti civil war . 
  but our government has done nothing but stigmatize muslims while letting in illegals and refugees . 
  it 's like they * want * shit to happen . 
  oh , please , the fsa is the red nose daesh puts on when it 's time to receive the ammunition drops . 
  make up new lies , those are getting old . 
  and given how the ypg have been fucked over and over by the turks , despite being one of the only forces to seriously fight daesh apart from the syrian army and the russians , allow me to doubt that fairy tale , whatever the source . 
  did i stutter ? 
  yes , that makes total sense with the policies that putin has been engaged in in the last years . 
  * : : facepalm : : * nato lies do n't even bother with credibility , these days . 
  it 's not a conspiracy theory , moron , it 's the fucking truth . 
  the `` moderate rebels '' we support , and were so encensed the russians had bombed four weeks ago , are the exact same guys who sell christian women into sexual bondage , and were throwing homosexuals off towers just a week before that . 
  and if you 've missed out how nato trained 5000 guys to prop up the `` moderate opposition '' just to graduate 50 and `` lose '' all but five to daesh with arms and ammunitions , you were just not paying attention . 
  so stop bleating about `` conspiracy '' anytime something or someone contradicts the nato-controlled narrative , it 's become so pavlovian it 's ridiculous . 
  do some independent fact-checking before opening your big mouth . 
  this assuming you 're not a nato troll with a mandate to spread their lies , of course . 
  your six months old account with nothing but / r/europe and / r/syriancivilwar comments does n't exactly plead in your favor . 
  you realize these people exist for only as long as it takes for us to deliver weapons to them , and then switch back to being al-nosra and daesh , do you ? 
  the guy is also an ex-member of [ a fair russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_just_russia ) , a socialist party utterly opposed to putin 's regime , and [ is about to launch a new party with gorbatchev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_democratic_party_of_russia ) . 
  his retelling of [ the old communist lie ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3szr1n/fridays_attacks_were_not_the_worst_acts_of/cx23bfc?context=3 ) about the events of the 17 & 18 october 1961 is certainly par for the course . 
  once a communist , always a communist . 
  that does n't make him wrong about who really finances daesh , or the hypocritical support they receive from the nato coalition in their effort to remove al-assad from power . 
  once again , western powers are playing with fire by stoking islamic radicalism against their enemies , and getting burned in the process . 
   to my mind , bashar al-assad is the priority . 
  the syrian president is responsible for the rise of isis in syria , and so long as his regime is in place , isis can not be eradicated . 
  more nato propaganda : isis is the child of the gulf petromonarchies , not al-assad , iran or hezbollah . 
  the blatant and relentless lies about it only fool the ignorants . 
  the whole article is a sham . 
  alain soral has it right : journalists are either prostitutes , or unemployed . 
  perhaps even less . 
  the whole thing smacks of communist propaganda . 
  quite right , the lack of cooperation and assistance in the matter , in complete violation of schengen agreement , shows that individual countries are only protecting their own selfish interests . 
  italy , greece and spain should 've been helped by all european states and navies to stem the tide of illegal immigration landing on their shores . 
  instead , we let them handle the problem , which they finally solved by letting the illegals cross their borders for richer countries . 
  the whole thing was a sham , and a shame . 
  what interest have the `` border countries '' in securing their own borders , if the `` destination countries '' wo n't lift a finger to help them ? 
  basically , all estimations of death were compiled/reported by a communist historian ( jean-luc einaudi ) who went on to deny pol pot 's and mao 's genocidal activities , and are highly suspect . 
   in 2006 , british historians house & macmaster [ ref . 
  needed ] note that in einaudi 's list of 246 victims for whom the date of death is known , 141 deaths were recorded * before * the 17th of october . 
  in this list one finds : several unidentified bodies ; algerians suicides or accidents ; at least 8 victims mentioned twice . 
  jean-paul brunet also finds a harki [ * algerians loyal to france who were often hunted down and murdered by fln members during and after the war . 
  jean-paul brunet notes that in jean-luc einaudi 's list of 393 victims , 57 only died between the 17 & 18 of october , `` police repression would therefore only be responsible for a minority of algerian deaths '' . 
  edit : proper ( - er ) english . 
   \\ #parisattacks change everything . 
  we must let no immigration be illegal and uncontrolled . 
  in what strange world is that `` absolutely disgusting '' ? 
  it 's just common sense . 
   this results in information from highly questionable sources often consisting of half-truths being disguised as `` news '' and shoved down the throats of an audience which ca n't be bothered to check its authenticity and the journalistic integrity of its authors . 
  every town has a sewer . 
  that 's were gawker media and its ilk live . 
  does n't mean the town is bad . 
   say what you will about the mainstream media but at the very least it tries to give the semblance of objective reporting . 
  that 's kind of my beef with them . 
  at least you * know * that salon or breibart are biased . 
  look at cnn , and its respectable facade makes it easy to sell the * really * big lies . 
  you know , those which start wars in the me and such . 
  in my country , i 've seen a so-called * expert * on the middle east linking isil and iran on the fricking 8 o'clock news , despite the absurdity of a shia theocracy supporting sunni takfiris at its border . 
  not * one * journalist there made a peep , despite one of them being of lebanese origins , and well-acquainted in these regional politics . 
  '' * semblance * of objective reporting '' ? 
  yeah , i 'd say your words were well-chosen . 
   that much can not be said about internet media where we have sites which not only make no effort to hide their political affiliation but actually pride themselves at being at the very end of the political extremist spectrum as i said , i 'd rather know the agenda of a journalist before listening to him . 
  when breibart writes an article on hispanic crimes , at least i know why they are writing it . 
  when the mainstream media chooses which crimes to publicize and which ones to ignore , only learning about the true crime statistics gives away their agenda . 
  the information is there if you look for it , though . 
  before , unless you were a specialist working the field , most of it would 've been hidden behind the media narrative . 
  the point is n't to make us all well-rounded , people are sheep and that will never change . 
  the point is that the barriers to access real information are lower . 
   that 's not democracy , especially if compared to the european one . 
  surely you 're joking . 
  the european union is a technocratic entity devoid of any hint of democracy , apart from a largely ineffective parliament with no power . 
  and since most national sovereign powers ( money , law , justice ) have been remanded to the bce , european council and european courts , unelected institutions answerable to no one , its nations are now largely non-democratic too .
