  goldman sachs [ bet against ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-04-13/goldman-sachs-cdos-bet-against-clients-misled-congress-senate-panel-says ) its own clients a few years ago ... 
  this is `` hilarious '' in 2015 because of the post-world war ii franco-german cooperation and the re-integration of west germany into western europe . 
  in 1946 , churchill [ declared ] ( http://archive.is/hsyzv ) that : `` we must build a kind of united states of europe . 
  in this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living . '', 
  in 1950 , schuman [ explained ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm ) in a more practical way how to build such a plan . 
  in 1952 , the european coal and steel community was formed to force european countries to have an interdependent heavy industry , mainly between france and germany . 
  the main aim was n't economical growth but peace . 
  the eu is just the heir of the ecsc . 
  the uchronic hypothesis of a tense relationship between france and germany since ww2 without the european movement or the forced interdependence of european economies is n't bollocks . 
  even japan and china who are economically interdependent in many ways are facing tension . 
   do you really believe the eu is keeping germany and france from war ? 
  today , even without the eu , germany and france may not risk war considering that such a war would cause both countries total destruction . 
  but thanks to the eu , the situation in europe is not just peaceful , but extremely peaceful , and our military spendings are at an all time low . 
  without the eu , it would be easy to imagine the same kind of relationship as india with pakistan , greece with turkey or iran with irak in a few decades . 
  germany would probably get nuclear weapons for example . 
  it 's only a possibility , but imo taking the risk is n't worth it . 
   why would he think we 'd actually want that back ? 
  the fear of a nuclear apocalypse was fun though . 
   if anything , people in this country tend to underestimate the importance of the uk in the 21st century . 
  we are all overestimating the importance of european countries in the 21st century . 
  * the uk has currently less than 3.75 % of the global gdp and less than 0.9 % of the world population . 
  * even germany only has around 5 % of the global gdp and 1.12 % of the world population . 
  furthermore , those shares are going down and will probably be much lower at the end of the 21st century . 
  this is n't anglophobia , this is pragmatism : our countries are becoming irrelevant . 
   that 's a direct effect of not having a real central government . 
   the eu is ruled by memberstates , obviously the stronger memberstates have more to say , and use that . 
  definitely true , and there is a contradiction in the argumentation of some opponents to federalization . 
  if the eu itself becomes stronger and does n't relies on the countries themselves , then the inhabitants of the weaker countries will become more powerful . 
  germany is the biggest and richest country in europe , with 20 % of the eu 's gdp and 16 % of its population ; california holds by far the first rank in the usa , with 14 % of the usa 's gdp and 10 % of its population . 
  their positions are roughly the same according to those stats , but the state of california has a very limited power over the other smaller and poorer states in comparison to the power that germany can have over greece for example . 
   in other words , they 're more in touch with the reality of such issues than the average voter is . 
  policemen have a direct access to the darkest aspect of an issue like this , but their perception is also skewed , because they do n't have access to its brightest aspect . 
  they have to deal with the boy coming from a bad neighbourhood who left school and became a criminal , but they never have to deal with the one who worked hard in school and became a nurse or a doctor . 
   fn is quite old of a party compared to ukip is n't it ? 
  ukip was formed in 1992 iirc you are right , the fn was formed in 1972 . 
  also , marine le pen tries hard to normalize the party since several years to gain legitimacy . 
  the fact that old britons are usually advocates of the brexit does n't mean that the old britons living in france also want to leave the eu . 
  the [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/17/brexit-british-seeking-second-passport-europe-eu-referendum ) made interviews about this , and the situation is the same for the british people living in [ spain ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-spain-idusl5n1210zt20151012 ) . 
  the people who want to leave the eu are probably not the same people who spend their retirement in france . 
  this is a very noticeable phenomenon in the south west of france , from bordeaux to the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es . 
  they tend to be retirees or vacationers and gather mainly in rural areas . 
  main reasons are probably that you can live in the same way as in the [ english countryside ] ( http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article116403.ece/alternates/s615/midsomer-murders-pic-itv-419020918.jpg ) , with the advantages of cheaper housing , a better weather , and fine food and wine . 
   as a german , i 'd also like to have the french national anthem banned . 
  it hurts my feelings when they insult my impure blood that will water their fields . 
  do n't worry , the anthem is n't against the germans !, 
  the `` impure blood '' is the austrian blood . 
  blaming the ecb for an irish bubble is slightly misled , to say the least . 
  you should look at [ gdp ( ppp ) per capita ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2015&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=65&amp;pr1.y=15&amp;c=132%2c112&amp;s=ppppc&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) , sir . 
  the colours changed between both maps . 
  in 1938 , there is a difference of 20 % between france and germany . 
  in 2016 , the difference is only of 10 % , but the difference seems bigger because of the colour selection . 
  ( even worse , look at italy vs greece ), 
  it was the capital of a major empire during centuries , which centralized wealth and cultural life . 
  uk 's wealth is n't mainly based on exporting goods . 
  and some real tax cooperation would be great . 
  if you look at the average writing or math capabilities of a 50-something college graduate , those capabilities are likely to be at least on par with those of a current college graduate . 
  the difference in the workplace exists because the old guy who is working as a current college graduate with a bachelor may just have finished high school . 
  most criminals , especially the violent ones , are young men . 
  it 's not intolerant to deduct that young men are more likely to be violent criminals than the rest of the population . 
  it does n't mean that being a young man is an legitimate excuse , nor that only young men are violent criminals , nor that young men are necessarily violent criminals . 
  about the laziness , i was talking about studying . 
  boys spend on average [ less time ] ( http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/11/04/homework-time.html ) than girls doing their homework . 
  it 's not absurd to say so , there are data to back this claim . 
  about the second point , it was about a clich\u00e9 for anyone who knows teenagers of that age . 
  of course it is absurd !, 
  still , teachers and parents can tell you that around that age , the kids are usually the most annoying , and it 's even worse for boys who are facing puberty at this very moment . 
  you just need tu put a disclamer or something like safesearch . 
  the solution can seem hypocritical , but it 's just a tradeoff , which is much more complicated because of the internet . 
  on the one hand , you do n't want to allow people to show pornography to children ; on the other hand , you do n't want to forbid pornography because it 's not hurting anyone if you allow adult to watch it . 
  women were discriminated because discrimination was allowed and there was n't formal equality . 
  the current situation of the gender gap in university is different , as it is n't the result of a discriminating policy nor a formal inequality . 
  i was dumb , and i was responsible for it , not my gender and having testosterone is n't a legitimate excuse . 
  i also have witnessed the same kind of stupidity among many boys , not as much among girls . 
  one can accept the fact that he was dumb or aggressive as a teenager and still be able to see that teenagers generally tend to be dumber and more aggressive than the rest of the population . 
  it is illegal if those images ** can be seen by a a minor ** ( cf. 
  [ art . 
  227-24 * code p\u00e9nal * ] ( http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do?cidtexte=legitext000006070719&amp;idarticle=legiarti000006418096&amp;datetexte=&amp;categorielien=cid ) ) . 
  the same law also applies to pornography , which does n't mean that pornography is illegal in france . 
  it becomes illegal when it is shown to a minor . 
  about laziness , i was talking about doing the homework , and i gave you a study showing exactly that . 
  about the stupidity , that 's just a funny clich\u00e9 , which you would know about if you have been a young boy , playing stupid games to determine who can punch the harder or endure the pain , and thinking about sex all the time . 
  that 's why i talked about `` 13 to 15 '' years old . 
  if you want scientific search , then you 'll find that young men ( and not only around 13 to 15 yo ) are more likely to act stupidly . 
  young men are [ more likely ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1571891305001706 ) to die in dangerous `` gendered behaviour '' that are usually considered as stupid like fighting , drinking too much or driving carelessly . 
  `` between 15 and 29 years , the ratio between male and female death is of 2.6 for 1 . '', 
  this is partly a result of a tendency to act stupidly among young men . 
   what changed ? 
  men were doing fine when they had even more memorization and homework to do at a time where they did n't suffer from the competition of women though . 
  for example in france , women could n't go to the * ecole polytechnique * ( which is the best and most elitist school of the country ) before 1970 because of the law . 
   extreme lowering of standards since the 60s . 
  that can have an impact , considering that women are closer to the [ average iq ] ( http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/paid2011.pdf ) , whereas men are more often above or below average . 
  a quote from the article that i gave you :  it may also be of interest to note that boys had larger standard deviations than girls at all three ages [ 7 , 11 , 16 yo ] , confirming the frequent contention advanced by havelock ellis ( 1904 ) and many others that the variance of intelligence is greater in males than in females . 
  now if the required level to go to college or to succeed in secondary school is around the average iq , but the level needed to be successful in graduate school is above the average iq , you 'll have more women than men in college , but more men in graduate school . 
  of course , iq is just a factor among many others . 
  true and sad . 
  an example showing that boys do less homework than girls published 2 months ago : [ gender gaps in high school students ' homework time ] ( http://edr.sagepub.com/content/44/8/432.abstract?rss=1 ) is a study made about the usa , but i 'm sure that the trend is similar in europe . 
   [ the study found ] ( http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/11/04/homework-time.html ) a gender gap of about 1.2 hours of nonschool study time per week . 
  boys on average spent a total of 4.33 hours a week on homework , while girls worked 6.33 hours . 
  researchers also noted additional gender gaps in both `` during school '' and `` total '' work time outside of classes , suggesting that boys tend not to compensate for missed homework during study halls . 
  the problem is less about `` sit down and shut up '' than about being asked about something interesting or at the very least useful and challenging for everyone .
