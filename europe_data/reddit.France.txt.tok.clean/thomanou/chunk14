  watching * fox news * can make you believe that obama might be a [ muslim ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/07/photo-obama-in-muslim-garb-shows-deep-ties-to-faith-oreilly-says.html ) , and that it was an essential issue . 
  they seem to be obsessed by this specific issue , like the daily mail is obsessed by benefit fraud or immigrants . 
  at some point , if you read at least one article every day about benefit fraud , you 'll start to have a distorted view and believe that this issue is the most important current issue . 
  actually , benefit fraud amounted to # 1.2 billion a year in 2012 according to the british government , whereas total fraud amounted to # 73 billion . 
  it works as an echo chamber , which is pushing an agenda . 
  the same goes with reading a disproportionate number of articles about inequality affecting women and minorities . 
  thanks to these echo chambers , you end up with people reading the world through the lens of their distorted views , such as jessica valenti believing that hillary clinton is n't trusted because she 's a woman , or angry daily mail readers believing that benefit fraud and immigrants are responsible for every problem . 
  maybe it 's not significant in their printed edition as i 'm mostly aware of their online edition . 
  also , articles such as what you mentioned can be informative and can definitely be worthy of coverage . 
  for a quantitative approach , you can just type words like `` diversity '' , or `` gender '' , or `` racial '' in the search bar to look at how common articles on those issues are in the guardian : several articles per day . 
  even more impressive is a search about `` equality '' . 
  this word used to be about liberalism and socialism . 
  one could argue that at least theorically , people are equal in front of the law today , which means that discussing legal equality is less important . 
  but the debate about wealth or income equality is definitely not over . 
  in the guardian , most results for `` equality '' are exclusively related to identity politics : women in comparison to men , or cultural and ethnic minorities in comparison to the majority . 
  and again , we are talking about several articles per day . 
  or for a more qualitative approach , look at articles like this [ one ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/hillary-clinton-women-trust#comments ) . 
  these 27 countries also managed to agree on a common line on many things like trade , higher education , free movement of people , peaceful diplomacy and a real international judicial order . 
  remember that the eu is the most successful attempt at building such a wide international cooperation through peaceful methods since ... ever . 
  the media is n't playing for the house . 
  many media are , but a decent number are n't . 
  there are several media that support different factions . 
  there 's not just a single monolithic establishment that is allowed to speak through them . 
  they can be used by different actors as propaganda tools deliberately or merely because it works well to appeal to their consumers ' guts . 
  that 's even more acute thanks to politically oriented tv channels , internet and the decline of newspapers . 
  during years , some media were advocating things trump said , like fox news , despite the fact that they did n't really support him as a person directly . 
  in the case of brexit , popular british tabloids spat on the eu during decades . 
  a significant share of the `` facts '' given by those tabloids or fox news are outright lies . 
  the same kind of lies are happening on the other side of the political spectrum . 
  for example , just look at identity politics that are being shoved down the public throat in respected news outlets like the guardian or the nyt . 
  the consequence is that voters do n't try to think , they are certain with merely feeling . 
  it becomes impossible to have a real dialogue between different sides on political issues . 
   so by your logic is france a tax-haven for its own large companies ? 
  by `` my logic '' , what are you refering to ? 
  because there 's nothing related to that in the comment you replied to . 
  each time there 's a discussion about ireland 's tax policy on this sub , someone , usually an irishman , comes up with the 8 % effective tax rate on profits in france for largest companies . 
  that 's whataboutism and it is also misguided . 
  why is it misguided to believe that france is a tax haven ? 
  because you just have to look at the number of corporations coming to france in order to pay less taxes : 0 . 
  if france is a tax haven , then it is probably the worse tax haven ever conceived . 
  now try to look for the same behaviour in ireland or in luxembourg , and you 'll find a significant share of the largest european and us corporations doing so . 
  ireland can get a lot in return because the bigger economies carry on with their system . 
  if france sets corporate tax to 0 % tomorrow , then the other countries of the eu would have to also set corporate tax to 0 % the day after tomorrow . 
  and when the eu would have done that , the us would have to do so too . 
  in the end , not a single country , not even france , would get anything in return for lowering their tax revenues in this race to the bottom . 
  corporations would be happy though . 
  also , ireland only gets the leftovers of the taxes that google , apple and others should be paying in europe , africa and the middle-east , and a few thousand jobs . 
  as ireland is a small country of 4.5 millions inhabitants , these leftovers appears significant . 
  it 's even more significant for pure tax havens that are micro-states like monaco ( 37 000 inhabitants ) , bermuda ( 65 000 inhabitants ) or cayman ( 57 000 inhabitants ) . 
  these leftovers would n't make up for the loss of tax revenues in france , germany , italy or the uk that are a thousand times bigger than those micro-states , or 15 times bigger than ireland . 
  being a tax haven is n't a `` sane taxation policy '' available for most countries . 
  it can work for bermuda , ireland , luxembourg , monaco or panama . 
  it could n't work for italy or germany even if they tried , because they are too big to be a parasite of a bigger economy that would be their host . 
  london 's r&d is quite low considering its size and its gdp , for example with patents [ in comparison to other european cities ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1c/top_30_metropolitan_areas_in_terms_of_total_patent_applications_to_the_epo%2c_2012_%28\u00b9%29_%28number%29_yb16.png ) . 
  ( high techs patents are missing for london , but those are n't [ extremely high in the uk anyway ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/ff/patent_applications_to_the_epo_-_high-technology%2c_2012_%28\u00b9%29_%28number%29_yb16.png ) and are usually more common in cambridge than london ) . 
  let charities and the private sector build roads , trains , flood barriers , prisons , snow-removal vehicles , running-water network and pay to clean the streets , fund the police , the judicial system , regulatory authorities or the army !, 
  people should also pay for their personal use of schools and hospitals . 
  if parents do n't have enough money to pay for their child 's chemotherapy , then so be it . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  they 'll say as usual that the eu is punishing ireland for its `` competitive tax rate '' . 
  they 'll also say that the eu never had power over tax , and that this plan is an overextension . 
  thanks !, 
  yes sometimes . 
  i do n't know the irish case with the lisbon treaty tbh so i 'll trust you !, 
  they can also be added in the treaty as preamble . 
  for example , the [ european regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/pdf/?uri=celex:32008r0593&amp;from=fr ) works like that : pages 1 to 4 are the preamble , and the real treaty starts with the 5th page . 
  it does n't look like that to the public opinion , but the preamble is n't legally binding . 
  it is mostly declarative . 
  i would n't be surprised if guarentees given to wallonia end up in the preamble to ceta ... 
  do you mean the icc ( international chamber of commerce ) in paris or is it something else ? 
  be wary of the fact that those kinds of guarantees are often stated legally , but are not necessarily legally binding . 
  it can be used in order to appease the public opinion or to help a government avoiding to lose its face during the negotiations ... 
  then we 'll need to steadily funnel tens of billions of euros on defense r&d during decades in a specific area to a specific university and the companies around it . 
  we wo n't have our own silicon valley by throwing money at startups through risk capital operations . 
  the definition is broader than that in economics and had no links with the far right or racial minorities when it has been invented . 
  it 's the fact of abusing the economic , social or political environments in order to get or secure an economic activity , bypassing the market . 
  it usually refers to companies and actors lobbying for subsidies or legal protections . 
  the perfect example are guilds enjoying privileges . 
  i do n't think that minorities activists are really rent seekers as their drive is n't the profit itself , even if they may achieve the same results sometimes . 
  canada is n't subject to eu law and has no oversight over eu law . 
  that 's why i talk about the long term . 
  do you remember the `` no '' in france and the netherlands to the european constitutional treaty ? 
  well , years later , it happened under a different name . 
  furthermore , there were talks a few months ago about a two speed eu . 
  if ireland sticks to its veto regardless of any pressure , common tax rules may also happen within the faster eu . 
  ireland or luxembourg ca n't block policies like this with the same strengh as the uk . 
  it 's not just about the right of veto . 
  the uk always had a strong voice in the eu because of the size of its population and of its economy . 
  ireland is way less powerful . 
  ireland or luxembourg are more guilty of facilitating tax avoidance than the uk . 
  but in the long term , they are much smaller hurdles to overcome for the eu in order to fight tax avoidance . 
   overall cops are n't seen very positively by the general population who tends to think of them more as enforcers/punishers than protectors . 
  an overwhelming part of the population has a positive opinion of the police . 
  the last big poll on this issue in may showed that 8 out of 10 members of the french population shared a positive opinion of the police . 
  only professional groups that enjoy an even more positive view are health workers and teachers . 
  after the charlie hebdo attack , during the massive rallies that happened around the country , the population [ applauded the police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqnlcgq4xgc ) to show solidarity with them . 
  elected officials keep on praising them in speeches . 
  only the far-left and a minority of street-criminals in ghettos really dislike and even hate the police . 
  they mention a study published by the `` oecd '' . 
  the oecd publishes two studies about skills and education : * pisa , about 15 yo students * piaac , about adults , including graduates .
