  on the one hand , the greek government see poor children living on its soil , so they want to give them a proper education . 
  other countries are doing the same thing , either in europe or in jordan for example . 
  on the other hand , the parents of those children just want to improve the life of their children , which is why they would like them to receive an education . 
  you would probably do the same thing in the same situation . 
  they ca n't give this education to their children themselves , so they try to get it from the power that could . 
  yes , the article talks a lot about those children 's health , but does n't say much about whether they speak greek or not , which should be the main concern before going to school in a typical local greek school . 
  even if they stay in europe , they are obviously not planning to stay in greece . 
  as stated in the article :  the lessons will be in greek , math and english , or another language , depending on where the refugees plan to travel on to . 
  it 's easy to understand `` german '' instead of `` another language '' . 
   why ca n't asylum seeker parents be given supplies so they can home school their kids or organise into small groups to do so ? 
  because you have to be educated yourself in the first place to be able to school your own kids . 
  it 's not a problem of supplies . 
  education levels were already not that high on average in syria , albeit improving before the war , are worse in iraq and abysmal in the likes of afghanistan or somalia . 
  also , the highly educated people from those countries that fled are n't in those refugee camps usually , because they fled before the rest or had higher means . 
   they are now hitting the middle income trap , and so far they have done a bad job getting around it . 
  china is an outlier though because of its size and recent history . 
  even if the country as a whole looks middle income , there are municipalities that have reached high level income ( municipalities that are bigger than most european countries ) , thus avoiding the middle income trap , and provinces that are still very poor , well below the middle income level . 
  they also have companies that are managing pretty well the transition between cheap and counterfeited goods to real innovation , like huawei . 
  countries stucked in the middle income trap ( brazil , south africa , argentina , indonesia ... ) do n't know this phenomenon , whereas the countries that did avoid the trap ( like south korea ) did . 
  but i do n't think that you could define democratic socialism like that anyway because you would have a hard time distinguishing this with a practice like using a public service delegation contract , which can be used by many kinds of government . 
  `` democratic socialism '' used to be about wanting to establish socialism through democratic means , by winning elections and making progressive reforms toward socialism , including mainly the social ownership of the means of production . 
  it was opposed to reaching socialism through revolution and violent means , but the end goal was the same . 
  nowadays , even if many newspapers try to describe corbyn like this , which he is n't , this view is basically dead or powerless in europe . 
  `` social democracy '' on the other hand is different , because it is n't about establishing socialism , but softening capitalism by promoting social and economic interventions by the state to improve social justice and efficiency in the economy . 
  of course , social democracy also requires democratic institutions . 
  european countries with their welfare states can be considered as social democracies . 
  sometimes they can act by doing what you said , but it 's not the only way to operate . 
  for example , the social democratic state can , in order to heal poor people or everybody , subsidize private hospitals ( as you said ) . 
  it can also operate public hospitals itself ( like the uk with the nhs ) , or even do both things at the same time . 
  according to your definition , the [ bush government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_economic_stabilization_act_of_2008 ) was democratic socialist . 
  exactly , he did n't do a bad job . 
  but a former bodybuilder and action movie hero should be the kind of strange candidate in his party , not the most reasonable one . 
  immigrants are inflating london property prices so much that hungarians should n't go there . 
  he 's not a reporter though . 
  that 's a satirical show . 
  they usually try to get interviews with politicians but ask stupid questions in order to mock them . 
  they lost their press cards 4 years ago because they obviously were n't reporting news . 
  i do n't know if they managed to get them back . 
  the two-party system does n't go along well with such a huge and [ growing polarization ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/ ) . 
  trump is n't the first fringe one , he 's just the most successful fringe one so far , but someone like sarah palin for example would n't have been better at all . 
  when you think that it 's annoying that , for the sanity and reasonableness of your political system and institutions , [ this guy ] ( http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4168/92/16x9/960.jpg ) was n't born in the us , you have a huge problem . 
  the problem is bigger than just the number of people that believe in creationism . 
  even among the majority of people , in our countries , that reject bullshit like creationism , most of them merely `` believe '' in evolution . 
  instead of believing , they should understand , at least basically , how evolution works . 
  but ask around yourself , in school or at work or in family , and you 'll see that most people do n't even have a basic grasp on how it works . 
  even a decent part of the people that received higher education ( not in biology of course ) do n't have a decent grasp on evolution . 
  they just `` believe '' in evolution because they were taught evolution in school , did n't learn much about it except the name and its importance , but that 's what smart people and specialists also seem to believe , and you are classified as an idiot if you do n't , so they follow the trend . 
  it 's a shame that people do n't get such kind of basic knowledge after spending at least 15 years in school . 
  the same thing could be said about global warming . 
  actually , europeans mostly use cars to go downhill . 
  i ca n't find a single reliable and independant source to support this claim . 
  the [ financial times ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/3e0172a0-6e1b-11e6-9ac1-1055824ca907 ) also explains , among many other sources , that :  `` at the root of political concern in washington is anxiety that profits are held abroad by us companies . 
  in theory at least , forcing apple to pay back taxes to ireland ** would reduce the pool of money ** that ** might ultimately be taxed in the us ** . '', 
  this is completely different than stating that the us taxpayer will pay apple 's taxes to the eu instead of apple . 
  the only source is the us government itself and apple , and the way it has been worded makes it obvious that it 's not the case but had just been said to cast doubt on the issue and get the support of the us citizen . 
  for example , the white house spokesman josh earnest said that : `` it 's also possible that the kinds of payments that were contemplated by the eu decision today at the end of the day are merely a transfer of revenue from u.s. taxpayers to the eu . 
  i think that is the crux of our concerns about the fairness of this kind of approach . 
  they ca n't claim money that should be paid by apple-ireland on apple-usa 's tax returns unless they bring back this offshore money into the us before paying in ireland . 
  they wo n't bring this money back unless us tax code is modified . 
  this [ article ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2016/09/13/no-u-s-taxpayers-wont-pay-apples-14-5-billion-irish-tax-bill/#73875cc513af ) explains it well :  other u.s. officials and commentators -- with the encouragement of apple ceo tim cook ( see his open letter here ) -- have also adopted the line that the $ 13 billion payment , if upheld , will fall on american taxpayers and not on apple and its shareholders . 
   is that really true ? 
   the argument that u.s. taxpayers will pay might sound legally correct , but it is misleading , since it ignores what 's really been happening and is likely to happen on the u.s. tax front . 
  ( that 's just one part of the article , it goes into details after and is worth the read . ), 
  the us wants it both ways : taxing profits made in the us by both us and foreign companies , and taxing profits made abroad by us companies . 
  you can do that if you want to , but foreign countries do n't have to accept lower taxes paid to them by us companies for profits earned on their soil because they also have to pay taxes in the us . 
  that would be a preferential treatment for us companies . 
   apple gave money in the first place for us taxes paid . 
  they did n't paid taxes on money earned abroad . 
  they kept the money in their offshore bank accounts . 
  the us government never saw that money . 
  look at this [ cnn article ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/14/news/tax-us-companies-offshore-cash/ ) about offshore cash . 
   the new oxfam report shows that apple holds the most money offshore of any major u.s. company , at $ 181 billion . 
  apple ceo tim cook said in december that he would `` love to '' repatriate apple 's foreign profits but that he ca n't because `` it would cost me 40 % . '', 
  the 40 % refers to the combined u.s. federal and state tax rate apple would likely owe . 
   at the time , forget the west in the us , it was n't under control . 
  same for canada . 
  and for the same kind of historical reasons , forget eastern europe in the eu because they were n't in the union when brussels became the capital . 
  the us and canada never had to change the location of their capitals after their expansion toward the west . 
  why should the eu change the location of its capital after its expansion toward the east ? 
  also , in terms of demography , vienna is n't much more in the center of the eu than brussels , despite the uk leaving . 
  about 3/4 of the eu 's population live westward of vienna and 1/4 live eastward . 
  sure , eastern europe is nothing like siberia in comparison to western russia , but it still has a significantly smaller population than western europe . 
  so trump would start again with the delian league . 
  he 's the new pericles . 
  they share the same statemanship . 
  the way government and politics work in belgium already almost gives de facto to brussels a situation similar to washington dc . 
  the european project was n't just about economy , even at the beginning . 
  it started out after ww2 to prevent wars between european countries , mainly germany and france , by merging industries that were needed to wage a war : coal and steel . 
  that 's why the first industries concerned were n't agricultural products or the textile industry or whatever . 
  it was in 1952 . 
  economy was used as a mean to an end , which was peace . 
  at exactly the same time was proposed the european defence community , with a plan proposed in 1950 and a treaty signed in 1952 . 
  it collapsed when it failed to obtain ratification in the french parliament in 1954 . 
  anyway , the idea is n't new and is actually much older than the current eu itself . 
  the two treaties of rome signed in 1957 established the european economic community ( eec ) and the european atomic energy community . 
  they have been ratified quickly after this time . 
  in the preamble it declares that the signatories are : `` determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of europe '' . 
  the way the eu is going is exactly the same since the beginning . 
  without the uk , it 's very probable that the eu would have much more power today . 
  the need to have a central location for the capital is a strange argument .
