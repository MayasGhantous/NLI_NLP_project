  many countries do n't have such location for their capital without any problem , including every big federal one but brazil : [ china ] ( http://images.chinahighlights.com/allpicture/2015/04/f394a00abf264c95b7f4eb89.jpg ) , [ russia ] ( http://www.rental-motorcycle.com/images/rental_maps/russia_rental_map.gif ) , [ canada ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/tkacchuk/tkacchuk1408/tkacchuk140800039/31046836-detailed-vector-map-of-canada-and-capital-city-ottawa-stock-vector.jpg ) , the [ usa ] ( http://www.ipl.org/div/images/stateknow/usmap-dc.jpg ) ... 
  there 's also the [ pyrenean mountain dog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_pyrenees ) , also called `` patou '' . 
  its primary role is to protect the flock of sheep against stray dogs , [ bears ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1b38bhiy3e ) in the pyrenees and wolves in the alps . 
  hikers should be warry of those dogs . 
  it 's unlikely that the uk agrees to follow every financial rule issued by the eu without having any input on . 
  for example , i do n't think that they 'd accept the tobin tax which is discussed currently by the main eu countries . 
  but even if the uk accepts every single eu rule , there 's still the problem of enforcing the rules . 
  european regulators wo n't be able to enforce the rules themselves as london would be out of their jurisdiction . 
  thus they would have to trust the british regulators to do this job . 
  the british government would have a compelling interest in [ not enforcing those rules too harshly ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/hsbc-us-money-laundering-george-osborne-report ) , to say the least , because enforcing those rules would only be beneficial to the eu , and not really enforcing them would be beneficial to the banks in the uk , and thus to the uk as a whole . 
  it would be a fool 's game between the british government and the eu . 
  the banks trust london 's regulators for being more accomodating than their continental europeans counterparts . 
  it 's not about the annoyance of having to force their employees to move in a eu state member . 
  it 's not about the buildings and infrastructures either . 
  it 's all about regulation and law . 
  as the nyt wrote in its article entitled '' [ london is eating new york 's lunch ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/magazine/how-london-surpassed-wall-street.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=0ea3f154190cc5c32e63a6eb598c13da&amp;gwt=pay ) '' :  `` how did london surpass wall street ? 
  in part because even in a world of electronic trading , brokers still want to know there is a human being at the other end of their 0 's and 1 's . 
  london 's working hours overlap with those in the u.s. , the middle east and asia ; new york 's do n't . 
  ** the more significant reason , however , is regulation ** . 
  in 1986 , margaret thatcher instituted what 's known as the big bang , which blew up centuries of regulations protecting britain 's old , slow-moving firms . 
  in an instant , the city of london went from a charming , ancient system of legally protected , relatively small institutions to electronic banking , enormous investment conglomerates and millionaires who made their money via speculative bets . 
  out were the oxbridge set and oak-paneled rooms . 
  in were ambitious young men with cockney accents and walls of bloomberg terminal screens . 
   more than any specific change in the law , however , the big bang signaled that the government was n't going to obstruct people from making oodles of money . 
  and so between 1986 and 2002 , this lack of regulation , often called the light touch , helped london catch up with new york . 
  then , after congress passed the sarbanes-oxley reforms in 2002 , the balance of power shifted further . 
  designed to prevent another enron , this legislation mandated , among other things , numerous reporting requirements that firms complained were expensive and bureaucratic . '', 
  global banks are happy with the current situation in london . 
  the british government was their main ally to prevent more regulation to the banking sector in the eu . 
  the rest of the eu ( at least the main countries ) always advocated for more regulation but the british veto was always there . 
  they do n't want to be forced to do a large part of their activity in a more regulated country inside the eu . 
  nobody wants to do anything to the uk out of spite . 
  what might be done would be done solely by interest . 
  having the main eu 's financial center located outside of the eu and thus outside of the eu 's regulating power in a place notorious for its tendancy for weak regulation does n't look like a wise idea , especially given this industry 's tendancy to cheat said regulation . 
  this is even without considering the jobs and the money linked to this industry that would continue to be outsourced to a foreign country if the current situation is kept unchanged . 
   nobody cares what ~ ~ the us ~ ~ us banks think in this . 
  i 'm eager to know which european commissioner or national leader fancy the idea of following barroso 's path . 
  it 's a bit complex as always with eu law . 
  it depends on the kind of act as summed up [ here ] ( https://europa.eu/european-union/law/legal-acts_en ) . 
  regarding apple 's case , the commission made a `` decision '' , which is binding but can be appealed before the european court of justice . 
  the prohibition of state-aid is also binding . 
  iirc , the interpretation of the `` arm 's length principle '' , which is important for transfer-pricing and for this case , does n't come from a binding eu law , but from the oecd , and can differ between member states . 
  if a state does n't comply , it will risk huge fines . 
  nestl\u00e9 would deserve it ^ but ^ they ^ are ^ swiss, 
  the irish government has to reassure mncs , not just apple . 
  they ca n't get on the side of the european commission , because it would send the message to mncs that the irish government is unreliable . 
  remember that the core of the case are two tax rulings issued by the irish revenue that the commission considers unlawful ( in their content , not in their form ) . 
  not joining apple 's appeal would say something like : `` ok , we [ the irish government ] were wrong with these written interpretations of tax laws we gave you , too bad . '', 
  also , joining apple 's appeal or not wo n't change the appeal 's outcome and wo n't poorly affect ireland 's relationship with the eu . 
  there 's no downsides in joining the appeal . 
  * imagine that they lose together . 
  it sends this message from the irish government : `` well we tried to fight this as hard as we could , it 's the eu 's fault . '', 
  it 's important for mncs . 
  if mncs leave ireland , it will also be important politically because many irish people will risk unemployment . 
  irish politicians will be seen as having tried to fight the imperialistic eu , but are not responsible of the consequences as they could n't do much against the eu . 
  * imagine that apple and the irish government win together : both are happy , they come back to the status quo , which means no taxes for apple and the celtic tiger is fine for ireland . 
  sure , ireland would not get $ 13 billion ( well , $ 19 billion with interests ) , but ireland 's economy main asset , which is harbouring foreign and especially us mncs , is fine . 
  * imagine that apple wins but the irish government did n't supported them by not joining their appeal : then the irish government appears unreliable ( not only to apple , but to every mnc ) . 
  apple still pays no taxes , but the trust in the irish government is still damaged for apple and other mncs . 
  they might want to find a more reliable place in europe . 
  we should make a board game . 
  * why apple would appeal even if they were extremely unlikely to win ? 
  if i had to pay 13 billion euros plus interest ( so around 19 billion overall ) , i 'd try anything to avoid or diminish the amount . 
  even if i had 1 in a million chance to win in appeal , i would appeal . 
  paying a team of lawyers a few millions is irrelevant in comparison . 
  * why ireland would appeal in this hypothesis ? 
  because they have to appear on the side of mncs . 
  mncs are irish government 's goose that lays the golden egg . 
  the irish government is afraid because the eu might kill it . 
  even if they had 1 in a million chance to win in appeal , they would appeal . 
  paying a team of lawyers a few millions is irrelevant in comparison to losing this goose . 
  do n't say it too loud , our politicians might fancy the idea of sending our pupils in your schools during their youth . 
  i have only found statistics from 2009 , but things must not have changed that much since then ( [ in french sadly , 4th chart page 4 ] ( http://cache.media.education.gouv.fr/file/2012/87/7/depp-ni-2012-29-depense-eleve-france-ocde_237877.pdf ) ) . 
  total spendings for a student from the beginning of primary school to the end of secondary school were about 100 000 $ ( ppp ) for finland , 106 000 $ for the netherlands , 107 000 $ for france and 108 000 $ for germany . 
  overall , each of those countries was spending about as much per student . 
  germany and the netherlands have a higher gdp per capita than finland and france . 
  also , germany and the netherlands have higher density than finland and france , which means bigger schools , which is overall more efficient in terms of spendings than many small schools . 
  the main cause of low german spendings in terms of percentage of gdp is the [ small youth population ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4cio ) in comparison to the overall population , because of its low fertility rate . 
  they used to use the [ same map as cnn ] ( http://vadeker.net/humanite/apercu/cnn-france-riots.jpg ) , but somebody told them to change . 
  the new one is definitely an improvement . 
  he was swiss , obviously . 
  well , it seems that nicolas sarkozy did n't hear you !, 
   tbh the fact holland lied about his stance play a role , nobody in france will want a social democrate in years because of it . 
  ca n't disagree with that , especially among the left side of the socialist party and their electorate . 
  most of those central and left wing parties accross europe are facing the same problem of an internal divide , from the spd in germany to corbyn and its labour party in the uk . 
   also macron has an habit of making comments , who are not always liked . 
  making annoying comments here and there ( such as '' the life of an entrepreneur is often harder than that of an employee '' ) is n't such a huge sin , when most of the contenders are straight up liers ( hollande ) , frauds ( jupp\u00e9 ) , crooks and populists that caused a war because of those very characteristics ( sarkozy ) , populists and obviously dangerous ( le pen ) , or so farseeing that they endorsed hugo chavez until long after his death ( m\u00e9lenchon ) . 
   is this ~ ~ great wall ~ ~ hadrian 's firewall of uk will allow to see the moons ? . . 
  macron is openly an advocate of free market economy , as he believes that it 's the best system . 
  as you can see on [ this poll ] ( http://www.globescan.com/news-and-analysis/press-releases/press-releases-2011/94-press-releases-2011/150-sharp-drop-in-american-enthusiasm-for-free-market-poll-shows.html ) ( second chart ) , only 29 % of the french population agrees with him . 
  in comparison , it is about 68 % in germany . 
  i suppose that this view is also shared by a wide majority of dutch people . 
  most french politicians among the republicans or in the socialist party , such as hollande for example , share the same view as macron . 
  but in order to be elected in 2012 , hollande lied saying stuff like `` finance is my enemy '' , because most french people do n't share this view . 
  also , macron used to be a banker . 
  which is a sin in the eyes of a huge part of the electorate . 
  climat change does n't get to vote though . 
   he was the man that managed to put gypsies in a train and got them out of the country . 
  the thing is , that the french government did n't forcefully deport them . 
  they paid them to take the train and leave the country .
