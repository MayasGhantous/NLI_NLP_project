  the real difference is that the trade balance between germany and the us is heavily in favour of germany . 
  the us did regret this decision about lehman brothers ' bankruptcy , and finally went for bailouts , for example spending $ 170 billion to save aig ( which is n't strictly speaking a bank , but a financial institution nonetheless ) . 
  the eu is n't subsidizing `` french agriculture '' . 
  it 's subsidizing agriculture accross europe . 
  france has the biggest agricultural sector because the country is the biggest in the eu , therefore it gets the biggest share of cap subsidies . 
  but those funds are n't overwhelmingly going to france , and french farmers do n't get more subsidies than farmers from other countries . 
  france gets 17 % of cap funds , spain 13 % , germany 12 % , italy 10 % and the uk 7 % . 
  it 's on line with the fact that france is the biggest producer with 18 % of the european agricultural production , and germany is second with 13 % . 
  it 's not a policy made to protect `` french traditions '' and is not a french special allowance as it 's benefitting every european farmer . 
  therefore it 's not comparable to the british rebate , which does n't benefit any other country than the uk . 
  murdoch once explained why he despised the eu : `` when i go into downing street they do what i say ; when i go to brussels they take no notice . '', 
  what you are saying about the personal connection in smaller countries applies to liechtenstein . 
  it does n't work that way with 60 millions british people . 
  they should . 
  if banks fail , the government will bail them out , which means that the taxpayer will have to pay for them , which means either tax raise or spending cuts . 
  the uk 's share of canadian imports and exports is around 2 % . 
  it 's about 10 % for the eu as a whole . 
  why would you find a canada-uk fta so important but would n't care about a trade agreement with the eu ? 
   i want a closer union not because of money me too . 
  that 's why i 'm not so sad to see the uk leaving . 
  if you look at the arguments made by the pro-remain side , it was only about money . 
  until there is nothing left to fish . 
  or the british government will have to find a way to make the fishing industry sustainable , through fishing quotas or something ... 
  french journalists tend to show more fake neutrality than british journalists , which is also why our newspapers never `` endorse '' a candidate like they do . 
  with friends like these , who needs enemies ? 
  many german-speaking swiss tend to criticize germans coming from germany , many french-speaking swiss tend to criticize frenchmen coming from france , and many italian-speaking swiss tend to criticize italians coming from italy . 
  he 's not standing up for brits by insulting the european parliament . 
  if his presence and what he said has a consequence if any , it 's only about making the negociation more difficult for his country . 
  remember that the european parliament has to approve the agreement that the uk will seek . 
  he is afraid actually . 
  be careful , such strong words could lead you to the european gulag in luxembourg . 
   in 1776 , only 17 % of the us population was religiously involved in america and by 2000 , the number of people who were religiously involved had actually increased gradually to 62 % . 
  it seems to be effectively a trend in the short term , but not that much in the long term and nothing comparable to northern or western european countries , which is what i meant by it not being purely a natural process caused by higher living standards , education and freedom , but implying that this is as much a cultural process . 
  just look at [ mormons ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2009/07/24/a-portrait-of-mormons-in-the-us/#4 ) : they are better educated than the average american population , have slightly better or equivalent income , which also means that they have better income than most europeans and higher living standards . 
  still , they are much more religious and conservative . 
   atheism on its own can only come naturally due to education , freedom and high living standards over a prolonged period of time over many generations . 
  you are overconfident about the natural aspect of this process as shown by the usa , where education , freedom and high living standards are at least on par with western and northern europe since the beginning of the industrial revolution , without achieving the same results in terms of religious beliefs . 
  for the us as a whole , but not for the different states . 
  also , there has been clearly a shift in the way this gdp per capita has been calculated between the years before 2012 , and in 2015 . 
  there are flaws in the chart , because the sources and measures used are different , even if the usa are growing faster than europe . 
  still , if you think about `` hillbilliness '' , you have to use the [ human development index ] ( http://mapscroll.blogspot.fr/2009/05/human-development-index-by-state.html ) to compare alabama to europe . 
  you are perfectly right . 
  that 's why the us improved a lot between 2012 and 2015 , when they gave up on leftism and chosed to go with free market economy . 
  that 's how massachussetts or new york managed to grow by 37 % in 3 years , while the usa as a whole grew by 24 % , outpacing china , according to * leftism against free market economy : the chart * . 
  you mixed ** gdp per capita ** for the american states , and ** gdp ( ppp ) per capita ** for europe . 
  you have to use gdp ( ppp ) per capita in both cases if you want to make a comparison . 
  during the recent years , emmanuel todd has been repeatedly clueless , despite trying to establish new spectacular ideas and concepts . 
  four years ago , he explained that hollande was going to be a new franklin roosevelt . 
  hollande would have started slowly but would have become more and more left leaning and revolutionary , following a reverse path to what mitterrand did . 
  for example , he explained that hollande was going to nationalize some banks . 
  he called this phenomenon the `` hollandisme r\u00e9volutionnaire '' . 
  now , he 's explaining that the cgt is trying to defend the constitution , while hollande and the current government are destroying it . 
  this is a trend that stems , according to him , from a new spectacular idea : the `` jemenfoutiste '' ( `` i do n't give a fuck '' ) mandate . 
  as if there was something so spectacularly new within hollande 's presidency that he 's establishing a new type of mandate , which was unknown until today ... 
  you are certainly right about savings or improvements in education , even though personnally , i would prefer to seek improvements over savings there . 
  i do n't know well the british education system , but according to international studies such as pisa , it 's exactly just as mediocre as in france on average . 
  your public schools ( i mean the private ones ) are probably significantly above that level , according to the share of their students reaching great universities . 
  if the difference is the same as in france , between our best schools and the rest , then it does n't come from higher or lower funding , but from who the students are . 
  it 's much easier to teach to selected students with parents involved in their child 's education than to other less involved population . 
  the french film [ * the class * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_class_ ( 2008_film ) ) shows a typical bad french middle-school , which could be found in poor * banlieues * . 
  it does n't get lower funding than much better middle-schools , exactly as in your example in hampshire . 
  the difference is caused by the students themselves . 
  just look at this [ high school ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9gt_nc41s4&amp;spfreload=10 ) in the us : it 's much richer than most high schools in europe ( or in france at least ) , nevertheless it 's awful . 
  let 's say that you have in the uk a high bi of about 1000 # per month since your birth until your death . 
  a fully privatized education would already cost about just as much every month , which means that your bi will only pay for your education . 
  the problem is that you still have to pay for your health care , your food , your housing , your clothes etc. . . 
  which means that you wo n't have a good standard of living , unless you have other form of revenue like a job or parental help . 
  actually , you wo n't have enough to study and live while relying on the bi alone if education is private . 
  it would also mean either higher taxes , which is not necessarily the best for small businesses . 
  small businesses and independent workers usually pay proportionally more taxes than big corporations . 
  by analogy : switzerland did n't fight during wwii and remained `` neutral '' . 
  still , the country massively helped the axis powers and profited from the war . 
  one could argue that switzerland 's help was even more significant for germany than italy 's help . 
  the british society is n't corrupted , or at least not directly like iraq as you said . 
  still , the city of london became the financial hub of worldwide corruption . 
  the uk is n't doing corruption itself , but is massively helping corruption in the world , including corruption happening in iraq , and profits from it . 
  this happens through the city 's financial institutions in conjunction with tax havens , many of them being british . 
  it 's not the main problem . 
  those cities are quite small and could be much bigger even with low or mid-rise residential buildings . 
  malmo 's metropolitan population is around 560 000 inhabitants . 
  copenhagen is three times bigger without [ high-rise buildings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_in_denmark ) . 
  even stockholm is n't that big in comparison to most of the big european cities that often do n't have high-rise residential buildings . 
  saviano is n't talking about crooked police or civil servants . 
  he 's talking about the massive laundering of ill-acquired money going on in the city of london . 
  for example , hsbc , which has its headquarters in london , [ helped ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-fine-prosecution-money-laundering ) drug cartels :  the bank processed cash for mexico 's sinaloa cartel , regarded as the most powerful and deadly drug gang in the world , among others . 
  at least $ 881m in drug trafficking money was laundered throughout hsbc accounts . 
  this case is almost certainly the tip of the iceberg . 
  crooked police in third world countries have a much more obvious impact , but is actually way less significant in absolute terms . 
  well , according to saviano 's extended definition of corruption , romania 's gdp is probably small change in comparison to `` 90 per cent of [ the world 's ] drug cash '' . 
   which eu state has the tulip as its official national flower ? 
   ~ ~ netherlands ~ ~  hungary whut ? 
  there are approximately as much inhabitants in ireland than smokers of weed in france . 
  the biggest net contributor ( outside of germany of course ) actually depends on the year because the rebate is calculated in a complex way . 
  you can find the [ net contribution ] ( http://english.eu.dk/en/faq/faq/net_contribution ) for each country and each year between 2006 and 2014 . 
  during this period , france had a higher net contribution during 6 years , and the uk during 3 years . 
  overall , during this period , france had a net contribution of 51,6 billions euro ; the uk had a net contribution of 41,2 billions euro . 
  there were several protests . 
  the two biggest protests had 22 000 and 20 000 demonstrators according to the police . 
  stangely , numbers given by organisers and those given by the police tend to be close in lyon , whereas the difference is quite ridiculous in paris or marseille . 
  outside of some cities like rennes , nantes , and marseille 's port , the protests are n't that important nor violent to be honest .
