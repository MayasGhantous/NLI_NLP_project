  even there , the violence is mainly limited to fights between a few hundred of violent protesters and the police . 
  there are also protests in paris but it 's not as big as it is usually . 
  in lyon for example , there have been 10 protests during the last 3 months . 
  one of them had more than 15 000 protesters ( 2 months ago ) . 
  the 9 other protests had less than 5 000 demonstrators . 
  to compare , after charlie hebdo 's massacre , there were 300 000 demonstrators just in lyon . 
  the situation is roughly the same in bordeaux , toulouse , strasbourg , lille , nice etc. . . 
  in the same way , strikes are fairly limited to the usual hard-liners . 
  it 's hardly a chaos . 
  actually , i 'd say that nationally , there is more chaos in the newspapers than in the streets ( outside of the misguided rush on fuel ... ) . 
  this is much smaller than the protests of 2010 ( against the law on retirement ) , the protests against gay marriage or of course the huge protests of 1995 . 
   the telegraph or the mail to name a few is just ridiculous sometimes . 
  at least , every sane reader knows that those newspapers are n't worth the paper they are printed on . 
  it 's even worse when such ridiculous criticism is coming from respected newspapers like [ * the economist * ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21553446 ) . 
  strictly speaking yes , but they are n't seen as newspapers , but as a form of entertainment , even by their buyers . 
  they do n't have any impact on politics , whereas the daily mail , the sun or bild have a great influence on public opinion . 
  well , we do n't have anything close to * bild * or * the sun * . 
  this is the union of french newspaper 's printers . 
  * they have a * de facto * monopoly of printing national newspapers * the union has the monopoly of hiring workers , which is a practice that the [ senate ] ( https://www.senat.fr/rap/r07-013/r07-0135.html ) itself considers `` abusive '' , resulting usually in political and family nepotism . 
  * it 's overstaffed and therefore excessively expensive * their retirement age is excessively early : xavier langlade , one of them and a communist leader [ retired at 49 ] ( http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2007/01/24/xavier-langlade-ancien-dirigeant-de-la-ligue-communiste-revolutionnaire_859089_3382.html ) for example . 
  * their wages start at 3500 $ per month and end around 7000 $ per month , which is n't bad for people without qualification . 
  * during the 1980 's , they smuggled papers to help cuban newspapers . 
  * in 1991 , the direction found out that the union had hidden around 5000 weapons in a warehouse after the bankruptcy of the french arms factory ( probably hidden for the `` grand soir '' , the general upheaval that will destroy capitalism ... ) . 
  * they regularly attack their opponents , for example an [ mp 's committee room ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcz81d_la-cgt-met-a-sac-le-cabinet-parleme_news ) in 2010 , who proposed a bill on newspapers circulation . 
  * they attacked a company called [ geodis ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2013/02/07/20004-20130207artfig00372-presstalis-le-conflit-qui-mine-la-presse.php ) in 2012 . 
  they were around 200 and armed with baseball bats and hammers . 
   so basically it sounds like you want to say nice things about the government in order to keep getting subsidies . 
  that 's not really how it works . 
  the government aid is well spread accross the political spectrum . 
  here 's the [ list ] ( https://www.data.gouv.fr/s/resources/montants-d-aides-pour-les-200-titres-de-presse-les-plus-aides/20150616-114235/200_titres_les_plus_aides_en_2014.ods ) of the 200 most helped newspapers with how much they get ( the yellow category is the total ) . 
  * le figaro * is a right wing newspaper which criticize the current government all the time , but still gets the most aid ( 15 millions a year ) . 
  the main criteria are readership , historical importance and the will to get every political ideas published . 
  therefore , the real criticism that can be made is that historically important newspapers such as * la croix * ( christian newspaper ) and * l'humanit\u00e9 * ( communist newspaper ) receive much more aid than their current readership should grant them . 
  it 's far from perfect , but it 's the main reason why we do n't have tabloids : newspapers have less to pander toward their readership , especially the lowest common denominator . 
   why on earth does the state subsidies private newspapers ? 
  supposedly to avoid [ this ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01944/simpsons-murdoch_1944238c.jpg ) . 
   which of the following is a fundamental principle of british life ? 
  corporations might be lying of course . 
  that being said , mobility accross europe is better than ever but still quite limited . 
  london 's housing market partly became the sewer of ill-gotten money from developing countries as implied by the article . 
  those buyers are n't investors trying to earn money , they are building a nest egg because they fear their own governments and political instability . 
  it 's not necessarily about tax like some greedy and rich european or american people or companies . 
  it is more like a dictator in a banana republic preparing his retirement for the day he might be thrown out of power . 
  the biggest elephant in the room is china though . 
  the same trend is going on in american and canadian cities on the pacific coast like san francisco or vancouver , solely because of the chinese `` investors '' . 
   so in france you pretty much need a degree to get a job ? 
  how about regular blue collar workers ? 
  it depends on the kind of blue collar job . 
  qualified blue collars such as plumbers , roofers et alii almost do n't know unemployment . 
  they are often more well-off than people with a degree such as teachers or young scientists . 
  many factories have closed during the last decades like in the uk , especially those that relied on a massive number of workers , which have been outsourced abroad . 
  on the other hand , unqualified blue collars such as cashiers or waiters are facing a specific situation . 
  if they get a job , they enjoy a better pay and situation than they would in the uk , in germany or in the us . 
  but it 's harder to get such a job . 
  it 's common for them if they are young to get a few sparse temporary jobs with periods of unemployment between them . 
  labour laws are partly responsible of this , especially the relatively high minimum wage . 
  the unequal divide in our two speed labour market is reinforced by the fact that there are a big public sector and semi-public companies which have a monopoly ( like ratp , edf or sncf ) . 
  civil servants ca n't be fired . 
  also , * de facto * , people working for semi-public companies ca n't lose their job either , and enjoy a much better situation such as a higher pay , longer vacations , fewer working hours and an earlier retirement age . 
  this is also the sectors where you 'll find strikers usually . 
  workers in nuclear plants are going on strike right now , along those working in transportation . 
   in regards to unqualified jobs , does this mean that more jobs are automated ? 
  there is n't more automation here , but there are clearly fewer cheap jobs . 
  it is more translated in slightly less economic activity overall . 
  for example , you wo n't find as many private gardeners as in the us . 
   is this issue even being discussed ? 
  in norway the youth unemployment rate has reached 11 % and there is already discussions that the government is n't doing enough to reduce it . 
  it is discussed . 
  this is even the main cause of the current labour reform according to the government . 
  still , the idea according to which the situation for those kept out of the labour market ( mainly young and unqualified people ) is so bad because the situation of those that are already in is so good and protected is n't accepted . 
  opponents of this law prefer to say that the situation is bad for young and unqualified unemployed people because of the `` globalization '' , `` neoliberalism '' , `` austerity '' or the `` capitalists '' . 
   how easy is it for young people to enter the job market in france ? 
  it depends on many factors : if you studied or not , in which sector you are trying to get , and where do you live . 
  it is quite fine for engineers and people working in the health sector . 
  for the rest , it ranges between fairly hard and extremely hard . 
  you might get lucky , or have a few internships , or get a short term contract . 
  there are a lot less unqualified jobs in france than in germany or the uk by the way . 
  overall , it 's much harder for young people to get a job . 
  here you can find some [ shiny graphs ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/series-longues.asp?indicateur=taux-chomage-ensemble ) showing how our young people are almost sacrificed . 
   today , it 's still obviously possible to run a business without labor flexibility , i mean france is n't a communist country with no businesses . 
  well , the french labour market is n't doing fine without flexibility , because it actually is flexible . 
  the lack of undetermined time employment contract 's flexibility ( cdi ) is the reason why businesses rely very extensively on short term contracts ( cdd ) . 
  instead of having the burden of flexibility shared amongst the workforce as a whole , temporary workers are bearing most of it alone . 
  big businesses are also outsourcing a lot , because the flexibility is almost absolute with external service providers . 
  actually , hollande is gerhard schr\u00f6der 's greatest fan . 
  matteo renzi would also be in the 3rd or 4th category . 
  he 's definitely at least on par with schulz . 
  he just lacks some bunga bunga to fit in the 1st or 2nd category like good old silvio . 
  eurostat made [ a map ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/82/map_1._price_level_index_for_food_and_non-alcoholic_beverages%2c_2012%2c_eu-27%3d100.jpg ) about it in 2012 . 
  germany is slightly cheaper than france and italy , and much cheaper than denmark or austria . 
  surprisingly , the netherlands ' food products are even cheaper than germany 's . 
  germany 's groceries are especially cheap for such a rich country though . 
  it is more expensive in france or italy , which are both less well off . 
  actually , having both average and median salary per country at the same time would very interesting . 
  this video is 31 years old , filmed during the cold war . 
  also , it does n't discuss at all the relevance of eastern european countries which prefer to be under the protection of the us and being part of the eu than being dominated by the russians . 
  chomsky explains in this interview how the us always made-up a soviet threat . 
  sometimes , that threat was actually made-up . 
  eastern europeans remember well that this threat was real for them though . 
  chomsky always focuses on the us point of view .
