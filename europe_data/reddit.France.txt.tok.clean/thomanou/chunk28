  for a bird , torino is merely 235 kms away , but going there as a mere human from lyon is currently as long as going to brussels . 
  a low unemployment rate is better than a high unemployment rate ** if everything else is equal ** . 
  of course , there might be problems behind that data such as people giving up on looking for work , but then it 's not a comparison made when everything else is equal . 
  a high unemployment rate means that many people are actively looking for a job but ca n't find one . 
  it 's simply better for society as a whole when people that actively look for a job can find one . 
  companies struggling to find people to work with is n't worse at all than people being stuck in unemployment . 
  civil wars , civil unrest , massive emmigration and dictatures started from very high unemployment rate . 
  historically , what is the worse thing that happened to a country because it had such a low unemployment rate that its companies struggled to fill their slots ? 
  it 's misleading if you only focus on employment as an end in itself . 
  a low unemployment rate ** is ** better than a high unemployment rate . 
  but it does n't tell you the whole story in itself . 
  it 's true for any kind of data . 
  a higher gdp is better than a lower gdp ; a lower poverty rate is better than a higher poverty rate ; higher margin are better than lower margin etc. 
  but a single stat does n't tell you the whole story . 
  by the way , while you are looking at poverty , keep in mind that those are relative and can be misleading too if you try to look too much into it without using them in context . 
  for example , czech republic has the [ third lowest poverty rate ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4nsf ) in the oecd . 
  still , someone earning the average monthly wage in czech republic can be less well off than someone just below the poverty line in norway or switzerland . 
  thus , even if norway or switzerland have a higher poverty than czech republic , being poor in norway or switzerland is not directly comparable to being poor in czech republic . 
  it 's kind of weird to divide london in several `` regions '' for example . 
  west inner london ends up with an extremely high gdp/capita mainly because there are more people working there than people living there , which is kind of misleading if you do n't keep in mind the commuting phenomenon . 
  in the same way , it looks like praha or bratislava are extremely rich cities , even richer per capita than stockholm , stuttgart , paris , wien or any city in the netherlands , which is misleading too . 
  france has to modify its constitution in order to ratify this charter . 
  president hollande tried to push for such a modification between 2014 and 2016 . 
  a constitutional modification requires at least 3/5th of the votes from the parliament . 
  right leaning senators voted against the modification , which therefore has been blocked . 
  this charter has n't been a theme at all during the presidential campaign , thus its ratification during the next years is unlikely . 
  welsh mafia . 
  hardly surprising . 
  guyane is a special matter though . 
  its problems do n't have much in common with metropolitan france 's situation . 
  a large part of it is barely developed and can only be reached by boat , planes or helicopters . 
  it is facing an explosion of its population ( from less than 70 000 inhabitants in 1980 , to 165 000 in 2000 , to more than 250 000 today ) thanks to refugees and immigrants from haiti and brazil . 
  35 % of its population is foreign . 
  there 's only half the proportion of medical practitioners in comparison to france . 
  it has a gdp per capita equivalent to portugal , amounting to half of france as a whole , despite having many well paid public jobs , huge subsidies , and a thriving spatial sector . 
  by the way , life is more expensive there than in metropolitan france . 
  crime rates are at least three or four times higher than in france . 
  protesters are currently asking for * more * police and army presence in guyane . 
  the list could go on and on ... main point is that guyane has endemic problems that are not really related to france 's situation as a whole . 
  the reason it gets little attention is that french outre-mer generally gets little attention in french media , and thus gets even less attention in foreign media . 
  when was the last time you heard something about surinam in a global media ? 
   i immediately thought about german cities . 
  like , i 'm pretty sure berlin is less expensive than paris ? 
  and what about madrid and roma ? 
  i do n't know how they chosed the world 's twenty largest cities to do business , but if they went for gdp , madrid , roma or any german city would n't be in the global top 20 . 
  if they went for population , well , even london or paris should n't be in the top 20 . 
  thus , i suppose that they went for the cities with the biggest gdp ? 
   at this point i smell propaganda to make parisians believe they live in a city that 's not that expensive lol . 
  it 's not about the cost of living , it 's about the cost of `` doing business '' , such as average wages , cost of r&d , cost of renting offices , taxation etc. . . 
  anyway , i also believe that it 's probably a kind of bs ranking used for marketing reasons , akin to the `` studies '' made by unknown think tanks or a big accounting firm about `` the most innovative cities '' , `` best cities for startups '' etc. 
  the netherlands , germany , ireland , sweden , denmark , the us or canada have a higher gdp per capita ( ppp ) than france , and thus have a higher hdi . 
  also , the netherlands and denmark have more `` expected years of schooling '' than the rest of the earth . 
  do n't read too much into it though . 
  if we look at the number of billionaires er country , or the wealth owned by billionaires in each country , the map would be completely different . 
  for example , germany or the uk have 5 times as many billionaires as spain . 
  from [ nexter 's promotional video ] ( https://youtu.be/sh_6sjiqrr4?t=5m39s ) about the former model , the caesar 6x6 . 
  denmark bought a newer version , the 8x8 , which is heavier ( 30t vs 18t ) , more robust , has more ammo and goes slightly faster on road . 
  the big difference is that the 8x8 ca n't be transported by a c130 . 
  the cannon 's caracteristics and the system 's swiftness are supposedly similar : less than a minute to deploy and 6 to 8 shots in a minute . 
  you can deploy the gun , shoot 6 times and pull out in 2 minutes and 25 seconds . 
  also , the crew being exposed while shooting does n't change anything against counter artillery , and should n't be close enough to the enemy to be shot at by anything else . 
  each time that someone says that ireland is a tax haven , you come up saying that france is worse by using that pwc report . 
  obviously , you do n't know anything about the french tax system . 
  do you know a single company that created a subsidiary in france , or moved its headquarter in france , in order to pay less corporate tax ? 
  a single one ? 
  french corporations manage to pay less tax by using subsidiaries in actual tax haven , and funneling their profits there , not by reaching a deal with the french treasury . 
  antoine deltour was working for pwc in luxembourg and his job was specifically about helping french companies funneling their profits in luxembourg to pay less tax . 
  he got found guilty by luxembourg 's justice for revealing it to the public . 
  there are thousands of people doing this job in luxembourg , in panama , monaco , switzerland , ireland for french companies . 
  there 's nobody doing that in france for foreign companies that would like to pay less tax by having their profits located in france . 
  bnp paribas has more than 200 subsidiaries in tax haven , lvmh too , kering has almost a hundred , schneider electric has around 75 , cr\u00e9dit agricole has 80 , soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale was all over the panama papers ... and that 's merely according to declarations made by these groups themselves . 
  even engie was reducing its profits in france through fake loans from luxembourg in order to pay less tax . 
  the french state itself owns a third of engie 's shares . 
  do n't you think that if a company could pay a single digit percentage of tax on its profits in france by reaching a deal with the treasury , engie would have reached such a deal ? 
  actually , these numbers are modified by the pollsters themselves . 
  usually , far right numbers are inflated by the pollsters , because thanks to their experience , they consider that many people willing to vote for the far right are not admitting to do so . 
  italy is already having a 50bn $ trade surplus . 
  3/5th of its exports go toward the rest of the eu . 
  italy has a 9bn trade deficit toward germany , but has a 10bn surplus toward france . 
  overall , its imports and exports within the eu are even . 
  leaving the single market would mean tariffs being imposed on italian products exported toward the eu . 
  italy wo n't export more unless the new currency is massively devaluated to the point of negating the tariff 's effect . 
  then they 'll have to leave the european single market as well , as it is forbidden by the european treaties ( cf. 
  art . 
  63 to 66 of the * treaty of the functioning of the european union * ) . 
  i do n't see italy doing better outside of the single market . 
  if italy is being bought piece by piece by france and germany in a quasi-colonial way , then replacing the euro by a weaker currency might help italy 's exports , but will also make italy 's assets cheaper , which means that france and germany will have an easier time buying italy piece by piece , is n't it ? 
  i do n't see how that 's a problem , as the same could be said for most countries . 
  for example , only 2 french cities ( paris and lyon ) are ranked , which leaves out 85 % of the country 's population . 
  considering the criteria , this ranking could have been called `` best major cities to raise a family if you have middle-class income and wealth '' . 
  switzerland , germany , austria and northern europe are impressive in that respect . 
  but if you do n't belong in that category of people , you might prefer to live in a different city . 
  for example , a college student will probably prefer barcelona , which is ranked 42 , over geneva ( 8 ) , basel ( 10 ) or bern ( 14 ) . 
  likewise , someone that likes to hang out often and is used to global cities and their downsides ( overcrowded transportation system , dirtiness , noise ... ) will probably prefer paris ( 38 ) , london ( 40 ) , nyc ( 44 ) or tokyo ( 47 ) over a higher ranked but much smaller norwegian , swiss or austrian city , which could be quite boring in that respect . 
  the french patent office and the french government already tried to put some pressure on him . 
  only consequence so far has been french applicants being punished by the european patent office . 
  it 's good to see the netherlands and other institutions saying that they 've had enough . 
  obviously , the most powerful country by far regarding patents in europe is germany . 
  need them putting some pressure too to get rid of him . 
  my phrasing was n't very clear .
