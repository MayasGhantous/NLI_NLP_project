  because of several reasons : * the debt itself is unsustainable . 
  greece wo n't ever be able to pay it back anyway . 
  * greece 's economy ca n't grow in this situation , which is in nobody 's interest . 
  * average greeks already got the `` hammer '' since years . 
  oligarchs are fine though . 
  we can blame average greeks for their crooked oligarchy , but considering that german , french and spanish companies among others reinforced this oligarchy during the last decades , the rest of the eu should also take some kind of blame . 
  * the eu with its population of 500 million people and more than a fifth of the world 's gdp is stuck since years thanks to an economic crisis hitting a country of 11 million people and a smaller economy than catalonia , lombardy , lower saxony or auvergne-rh\u00f4ne-alpes , which is both stupid and bullshit . 
   well modern france would n't be so rich without colonization . 
  not really . 
  jacques marseille wrote a thesis on this subject during the 1980s entitled * colonial empire and french capitalism . 
  history of a divorce * . 
  according to him , colonization costed more to france than it enriched itself . 
  this thesis still holds the historical consensus on this issue . 
  colonization might have been worth it for several private actors , but overall was a bad deal for metropolitan france . 
   the problem here was that he was using the term crime against humanity which has a very specific meaning since the internation justice court has been established if you look at legal definitions of crimes against humanity ( ex : [ article 7 ] ( https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf ) of the rome statute , or [ article 212-2 of the french penal code ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcode.do?idsectionta=legiscta000006165273&amp;cidtexte=legitext000006070719&amp;datetexte=20130725 ) , or even the [ older definition before its modification ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do;jsessionid=a63ade7440bf2aafbd8ef2de19fca30f.tpdila19v_3?idarticle=legiarti000006417535&amp;cidtexte=legitext000006070719&amp;categorielien=id&amp;datetexte=20100810 ) in 2010 ) , colonization as used by france especially in algeria is definitely a crime against humanity . 
  in lyon , there 's a lot of stations and bikes to rent considering the city 's size . 
  currently , there are 350 stations and 4000 bikes . 
  in comparison , london has 750 stations and 11500 bikes , despite being 10 times more populous and more than 20 times bigger than lyon . 
  the price is 1.5 $ for a day , 5 $ for a week , or 25 $ for a year . 
  60 000 people have the year long pass , and around 800 000 people use occasionally the system each year . 
  local authorities promote the system a lot , and increased the lengh of cycling ways by 50 % during the last 15 years . 
  the city is using the bike-sharing system as leverage in order to increase the number of any kind of bike users . 
  overall , bike users have been multiplied by 3 since the bike-sharing system started . 
  also , the city made a very good deal with the bike 's provider , that consequently could n't even make a profit . 
  we are encircling the us , like italy surrounded the papal states . 
  ^ ^ ^ soon ... 
  our only real threat is russia . 
  we should get a purely defensive nuclear arsenal given to the eu , which would be triggered automatically according to a treaty if any country of the eu is being directly invaded or bombed . 
  it would give us coercive credibility , more independence , and could be funded through the eu with a budget of something like 30 bn euros . 
  we do n't even have to develop nuclear weapons , just set up the institution , build and deploy them . 
  to quote [ * le nouvel economiste * ] ( http://www.lenouveleconomiste.fr/a-la-une/lyonmarseille-le-match-qui-na-pas-lieu-detre-14947/ ) comparing both cities :  one has the charm of a middle-aged hooker , the other has this comforting quality of the bourgeoise that a man is relieved to find still there and who will cook him delicious dishes without asking him questions . 
  i get your point . 
  it 's arrogant to say that you deserve more than you are worth . 
  for example , a mere peasant would be arrogant to say that he 'd deserve to be allowed to ride a horse and carry a sword . 
  a lord saying the same thing would n't be arrogant though , because as a lord , he 'd deserve the right to ride a horse and carry a sword . 
  sure , britain is often asking for a lot . 
  but it 's not arrogant if british people are truly superior though . 
  what have you done to deserve such advantages ? 
  put yourself to the trouble of being born -- nothing more . 
  according to the pizzeria , right [ here ] ( https://www.google.fr/maps/@43.2855536,5.3508398,3a,60y,118.24h,86.2t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skpfrdyh1lwwmf4iwcbc3pg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , rue du vallon des auffes .

  that 's pretty accurate . 
  ^ unlike ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ british ^ ^ ^ ^ stance ... 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  you are saying that if taxation gets too high , high earning professionals are going to leave their work and say `` fuck it , no babies and i 'm going into unemployment , now you sponsor me '' . 
  that 's absolutely not going to happen . 
  either they 'll go on with their highly taxed highly paid job they already have , or they might look for a job elsewhere , or maybe they 'll try to avoid taxes through illegal means , but they are not going to say `` fuck it , i 'm going unemployed '' . 
  high earning professional might decide to leave the country in order to work elsewhere , but they wo n't decide to `` go into unemployment '' ... 
  when most people , including well-off europeans , decide to have children or not , they do n't do so by thinking about the planet 's population . 
   the european union is too unwelcoming of any alternative economic and social models other than the holy trinity of productivism , consumerism and mercantilism actually , european elections did n't led to the victory of parties advocating a different economic and social model . 
  conservative parties won and central-left parties were solid second , winning the popular vote by the way , and the third party was the liberal-centrists . 
  you might not like it , but the wide majority of voters voted for parties that are in favor of this current economic and social model . 
  parties advocating clearly an alternative economic and social model won 13 % of the votes , and 15 % went to parties advocating the end of the eu . 
  it is important though . 
  that 's why when rbs is struggling , the british government goes to his bedside ; that 's why the german government cares much more than any other government about deutsche bank 's or vw 's problems in the us ; also why the french government had a quasi-symbiotic relationship with elf-aquitaine , and still watches very closely how total is doing , whereas it does n't really care about shell or bp or exxonmobil ... 
  the national component of global companies seems diluted , but it did n't disappeared , it 's just less obvious . 
  also , it goes both ways . 
  if deutsche bank needs to be bailed out , it will go to the german government , not to the american , british or chinese government . 
  another example would be if the french president goes to india , many leaders of french multinationals will come with him in order to find contracts , but you wo n't see multinationals from other countries doing so . 
  it 's definitely not just about jobs . 
  governments are doing so because having global companies from their country is an element of power , be it technical ( think about cisco , intel or amd being huge assets to the us , despite being global and private companies ) or economic . 
  amazon being an american company is an asset to the us . 
  i 'm sure that if the eu or china were going to set up a policy aimed at hitting amazon ( kind of like when the eu went after apple 's tax scheme for example ) , the us government would not stand idle . 
  for hollywood , newspapers or media and entertainment in general , language barrier 's effect is obvious , which is also why british cinema , songs , books or media are much more benefitting from globalization than their german , french , spanish or italian counterparts . 
  * harry potter * , adele or the * financial times * could n't come from italy for example , not because of a superior british talent over italian talent , but because of the language . 
  but it ca n't explain the fate of global platforms that do n't rely on language . 
  coming from an english speaking country was n't that much of an asset for google , apple , facebook or visa and mastercard . 
  you do n't really see british global platforms either . 
  so there 's probably a lack of harmonisation/federalisation at stake . 
  also , there 's a kind of trillema with `` disruptive '' actors . 
  i 've heard this idea from a conference spoken by pr . 
  jane winn about fintech , which is an area where new global platform might appear anytime soon . 
  you can : * protect the average people , which are customers/workers * allow disruptive innovation to thrive * protect well established actors . 
  you can only have 2 of the 3 elements at the same time . 
  according to her , the us decided to have both the second and third elements , whereas europe protects the first and third elements . 
  currently , europe is absolutely not able to compete with the us in the area of global platforms ( amazon , facebook , ebay , google , microsoft , apple , uber , visa , mastercard , netflix , even the way hollywood works to some extent ... ) . 
  that 's one of the perks of having a unified country , which has the size of a continent . 
  outside of these very obvious sectors , the competition is n't really one-sided though . 
  france did it 8 times throughout history . 
  the last time was in 1812 though , during napol\u00e9on 's reign , after two decades of war against the rest of the continent . 
  thus , if i 'm not mistaken , only switzerland has a longer record of paying its sovereign debt flawlessly than us , while sweden is on par with us . 
  that would be a shame to fall from the podium thanks to the fn 's lunacy , whereas several revolutions , multiple economic crisis , the franco-prussian war , two world wars and decolonization could n't push us to do so . 
   yes , that 's a very nice way to put it , but i 'm gon na stick to my blunter explanation . 
  actually , that 's the way an historian would put it , even if it 's not as useful and funny as a moral fable about `` cockiness '' . 
   they blackmailed us into the euro because they were scared . 
  now they 're scared again . 
  ahem , okay , but not our fault it 's funny how people born during a war against a country that killed a fifth of its young fellow countrymen , and then got wounded and taken prisoner fighting the very same country before escaping and fighting it again are not very fond of the perspective of seeing this country become a potentially threatening power again , and would rather make sure to have it as an ally , is n't it ? 
  obviously , germany was going to be much more powerful in the following years . 
  the point was to force germany to have a compelling interest in being the main member of a powerful european union , instead of going its own way lefting its neighbouring countries in the cold . 
  it was n't a trap set up to weaken germany 's economy in order to compete with it . 
  come on , eveybody could understand some flip-flop with that kind of [ smile ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/sites/nb.com/files/styles/w_1000/public/styles/paysage/public/cms/edito/201508/mathieu_gallet_pays_sipa.jpg?itok=gt6tlp0y ) . 
  we have got [ macron ] ( http://preprod-img.planet.fr/files/styles/diaporama_large_fixed_height/public/images/diaporama/6/5/2/843256/2031868-inline.jpg?itok=qctrkd1o ) and [ rama yade ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6z9yikz.jpg ) as candidates in the center , [ hamon ] ( http://static.directmatin.fr/sites/default/files/styles/image_880_495/public/part-dv-dv1546426-1-1-0_0.jpg?itok=arz2t2le ) on the left side , we just need [ baroin ] ( http://www.novaplanet.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/page_mea/bsn/images/capture_decran_2012-12-04_a_13.02.39.png ) to replace fillon and [ marion ] ( http://marionlepen.fr/wp-content/gallery/marion/marion_marechal_lepen_en_rendezvous23.jpg ) mar\u00e9chal-le pen to replace her aunt in order to have the best looking election of the vth republic . 
  well , our respective histories are different . 
  ireland is doing fine for example . 
  they wo n't look at the 1960s and say that things were better back then , because the current irish tiger is much better than their past situation . 
  spain and portugal experienced actual fascism . 
  you know first hand that it 's not that great , in the same way that actual communism vaccinated most of eastern europe at a time when it looked fancy in france or italy . 
  also , you are probably not feeling that your country is declining in comparison to a few decades ago . 
  a country like italy is economically closer ( and worse ) than france , but is facing a different situation because of its internal politics . 
  for example , people in the north are not blaming only the establishment or african immigrants in the same way the fn is doing in france , because they have somebody else to blame : a `` freeloading '' , `` lazy '' and `` corrupt '' south .
