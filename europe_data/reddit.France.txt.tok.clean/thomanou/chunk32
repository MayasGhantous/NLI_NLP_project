  you are actually meeting a member of one of those sects . 
  the actual person is hidden behind . 
  now imagine that those persons make up 3 % of your neighborhood or village 's population . 
  their behavior does n't really matter . 
  it wo n't have any significant consequences as they are diluted in the general population . 
  but if they are increasing in number , and make up a significant minority or even become the majority in your neighborhood or village , it will have huge consequences on the lives of the rest of the population . 
  the people that never made the individual choice of wearing that kind of outfit or any other similar behavior will have to suffer great consequences on their lives . 
  i do n't have a source in english , but if you can read in french , you should definitely read [ this article ] ( http://www.liberation.fr/france/2003/12/10/leur-voile-j-ai-envie-de-l-arracher_454783 ) published in * lib\u00e9ration * , the french equivalent to * the guardian * in 2003 . 
  it 's a best-of of women 's testimonies suffering peer and family pressure forcing them to wear a veil . 
  democracy ca n't work in a society that has significant group of people like that , that do n't behave as individuals but only as member of a group . 
  as [ lee kuan yew ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/spiegel-interview-with-singapore-s-lee-kuan-yew-it-s-stupid-to-be-afraid-a-369128.html ) put it : `` in multiracial societies , you do n't vote in accordance with your economic interests and social interests , you vote in accordance with race and religion . '', 
  for example , look at what happened to [ east rampo ] ( https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/534/transcript ) , a ny 's neighborhood , when hasids reached a significant share of the population . 
  it 's not about providing a safe space to right wingers . 
  it 's about protecting a secular society where people can act as individuals with a significant , albeit not unlimited , freedom . 
  it would be much more immersive if children had to wear that instead of grown up women . 
  i 'd be okay with jawas running around . 
  thanks , never saw this film . 
   there 's is a clear distinction between the two , great britain the island is amazing , beautiful landscapes , amazing history and great people . . 
  the political entity that is the uk is less desirable . 
  you might take it as an attack on great britain , but it 's only posturing against the political union . 
  i understand you see them as the same thing , but they 're not ... 
  it 's common for british people to insist on the distinction between europe ( the continent ) and the eu . 
  i find it way less common among people on the other side of the channel . 
  for many , despite not being a real federal state , ** the eu is europe ** outside of a few details ( norway , switzerland , a few balkan states , andorra ... ) . 
  even with the uk out , it wo n't change , especially considering that you are not in mainland europe . 
  if an american official is saying that he 'll try to destroy the eu , most of us are not going to say that `` he 's only advocating the end of a supranational institution , he has nothing against europe '' . 
  most of us are taking it as a straight attack against europe and the people living there . 
  why did he use jean dujardin 's face ? 
  he 's is n't exactly a swiss icon , despite a short [ trip to gstaad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk6toudcjeo ) . 
  he should have went with an actual swiss , like tell , rousseau , dunant or federer . 
  do n't start with that shameful peace of paper that would have limited the army to a force of merely 100 000 men . 
  it makes me want to invade poland with 1 500 000 soldiers . 
   you realize this will lead no where ? 
  exactly , which is why it 's called a * probatio diabolica * . 
  you ca n't prove that she did n't do something beyond any reasonable doubt , because ** you ca n't prove a negative fact beyond any reasonable doubt ** . 
  what you are asking for is impossible . 
  likewise , nobody can prove beyond any reasonable doubt that father christmas and his elves do n't exist . 
  ** the newspaper did prove that she very probably did n't work as a parliamentary attach\u00e9 ** though , but a small doubt remain necessarily as it is a negative fact . 
  still , proving a positive fact such as actually doing a job during 5 years is not only possible but fairly easy to do . 
  for example , they can prove that she was at these meetings , wrote those papers etc. 
  considering the gravity of the newspaper 's accusation , and fillon 's position , he has to prove that his wife actually worked as a parliamentary attach\u00e9 . 
  if she did , it will be easy to prove it . 
  i 'm sure that in such case , fillon will also be able to sue the newspaper for libel and win the case easily , coming out reinforced from this event . 
   then why was he paying her ? 
  he does n't check where 5k/month are going `` for a small literary magazine '' that sems also weird . 
  michel crepu is the magazine 's director , more precisely its editor-in-chief . 
  he is n't the magazine 's owner . 
  he 's not the one actually paying her , because it is n't his own magazine . 
  the money goes out of the owner 's pocket , indirectly , through several corporations that he owns . 
  it happens that this magazine 's owner is marc ladreit de lacharri\u00e8re , who 's simultaneously a friend of fillon , a right-winger and the 722nd richest man on the planet . 
  that kind of money would be merely pocket change for him . 
  if you are paid 5000 $ a month by a magazine during a year and a half , while the magazine 's director claims that he never saw you working there , then you probably was n't working there . 
  especially when we are talking about a small literary magazine , not a big newspaper with hundreds of employees . 
  funnily enough , here 's this [ month 's issue ] ( http://rddm.revuedesdeuxmondes.fr/prod/file/r2m//issue/bigcover/38.jpeg ) . 
  likewise , if you are a parliamentary attach\u00e9 , which means that you are part of a team which consists at most of a handful of people , these people should know that they work with you . 
  your husband wo n't claim that you are a stay at home mom if you are working hard as his own substitute 's parliamentary attach\u00e9 earning 6900-7900 $ a month . 
  they found out which job she was paid for , and people that should have known that she was doing this job ( her colleagues , her director ) did n't know that she was doing it . 
  asking for more is asking for a * probatio diabolica * . 
  not so widespread ** accross europe ** . 
  this article is n't just about romania , if you actually read it . 
  it 's about `` romaphobia '' accross europe . 
  i 'd say that this article is wrong , as `` romaphobia '' is n't that widespread accross the continent . 
  i 'm specifically talking about roma people as in this article from vice . 
  this article talks about a current wide persecution of roma communities accross europe . 
  wide persecution of roma people accross europe during the past is an historical fact , as you say . 
  current persecution is not so widespread as this article is stating . 
  if you look at their fate in western europe , mainly in germany , france , benelux and nordic countries , they are very much marginalizing themselves . 
  therefore , it 's difficult to blame eastern european countries for the current marginalization of roma people , when they also end up marginalized in western and northern europe despite our efforts to deliberately not marginalize them . 
  for example , this article talks about sarkozy targetting roma people with a `` special treatment '' similar to what the nazi did , including deportation and evictions . 
  i 'm fairly certain that sarkozy deported illegal immigrants , and evicted people that were illegally occupying property , because they were illegal immigrants and illegally occupying property , not because they were roma . 
  it so happens that the wide majority of illegally occupied sites where occupied by roma people . 
  he also said publicly that `` roma people that would come to france in order to establish themselves on legal sites are welcome '' , which is hardly a nazi-like thing to say . 
  there 's a school in my city aimed specifically at educating roma children . 
  they obviously have special needs , as they do n't speak french to begin with . 
  the school is opened during normal school hours , between 8:30 am and 17:00 pm , has teachers trained to teach to foreign students and is entirely free . 
  roma students are on average there during 1 or 2 hours a day , because their families need them to `` work '' during the rest of the day , which means begging or doing some illegal activities . 
  roma people marginalize themselves more than we do . 
  providing free education , free professional training , reduced transportation fees , often free housing and completely free and world class healthcare to a group of people that almost does n't pay any tax is n't exactly an attempt to marginalize them . 
  the label is the consequence of a policy introduced by the british government at the end of the 19th century . 
  it was aimed at fighting against cheap knockoffs made by foreign companies ( sounds a bit like china today ) , which were mainly german at the time . 
  finally , german companies managed to produce goods that were better than their british competition . 
  for the british public , `` made in germany '' did n't become a label for `` cheap counterfeited goods '' , but became a label of superior quality . 
  norway is a petro-state with a gdp per capita ( ppp ) which is roughly 60 % bigger than france . 
  without ppp , the difference is even bigger . 
  thus , comparison between both countries is kind of irrelevant . 
  it would be akin to compare japan to malaysia . 
  if you look at those numbers , france has higher government spending as a share of gdp than sweden , but slightly lower than denmark or finland . 
  but french numbers are skewed because of pensions that are almost fully funded through a public system . 
  as you can see on this [ chart ] ( https://image.webservices.ft.com/v1/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fftalphaville.ft.com%2ffiles%2f2014%2f11%2foecd-social-spending-by-type-590x571.png?source=alphaville ) , the difference is significant . 
  nordic countries have a mixed private and public pension scheme . 
  by adopting a similar system as denmark , without actually spending less on pensions , france 's government spending would be around 50 % government spending as a share of gdp , a level similar to italy or austria . 
  if you look at expenditures for specific public services as those you named , you 'll find out that switzerland does n't spend significantly less on those than france or the uk . 
  for example , [ government expenditures on education as a share of gdp ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/se.xpd.totl.gd.zs?locations=ch-fr-gb ) are roughly similar : 5 % for switzerland , 5.5 % for france and 5.6 % for the uk . 
  then , as switzerland has a much higher gdp per capita than france or the uk , even in ppp , it is able to achieve more with the same share of gdp , as it means more money . 
  for example , if they have to buy equipments for schools or public transportation , they 'll have either better equipment or more of it for the same effort . 
  they also spend less on some areas like [ military expenditures ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs?locations=ch-fr-gb ) . 
  last but not least , as noted by other contributors , they do n't have healthcare counted here , as it 's a mandatory private system , despite spending [ slightly more than france ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.xpd.totl.zs?locations=ch-fr-gb ) and significantly more than the uk on it . 
  if switzerland had a publicly funded healthcare system , it would have its government spending increased by more than 33 % . 
  during the revolution , french politicians kept making reference to ancient roman politicians . 
  that 's an improvement !,
