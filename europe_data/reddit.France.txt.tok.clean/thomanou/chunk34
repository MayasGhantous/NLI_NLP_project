  according to a government 's study , for each 100 $ given through this way , this benefit caused an increase of rents of about 60 $ . 
  in the end , for each 100 $ of public money , the government is actually spending 40 $ directly to help poor lessees , and 60 $ to help ... lessors . 
  taxpayers are worse off , poor lessees are marginally worse off , other lessees are significantly worse off , and lessors are getting wealthier . 
  as this universal income would be generalized , the inflationary effect should be even worse . 
  the only way for this to work without creating inflationary effects in tense housing markets would come from many people deciding to work in other areas than those tense areas , or many people deciding to not work anymore and go live in a rural area . 
  do n't be such a spoiled brat . 
  without this barrier , london would have bought every single sandbag in great britain , leaving the rest of the country at the floods ' mercy .

  [ ok ] ( http://conselium.com/wp-content/uploads/red-flag.jpg ) . 
   extending the anglosphere to include economies such as india and singapore ok . 
  unless someone is planning on a new british or american raj , the anglosphere would n't be very * anglo * by then though . 
   the anglosphere countries tend to spend more money on defence as a proportion of gdp . 
  recent figures for 2015 estimate defence spending was 3.3 per cent of gdp in the us , 2 per cent of gdp in the uk and 1.9 per cent of gdp in australia . 
  higher defence spending , combined with the so-called five eyes intelligence sharing alliance , could be seen as providing a basis for enhanced cooperation . 
  the author conveniently forgot to say that [ nz spends on military only about 1.2 % and canada only about 1 % ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs?locations=ca-nz-1w-gb-us ) of their respective gdp , and that even the uk is spending below the world average of 2.2 % . 
  as the uk has a significant economy , which is reinforced by its history , its military power remain significant . 
  but really , in the anglosphere , there 's only a single extraordinary military power : the us . 
  which means that a unified anglosphere would be extremely powerful , but that seems far fetched to consider that as sharing english language , higher military spendings are a typical trait of those countries . 
   france they 're pretty much hypocrites exactly as every single country on this planet , outside of maybe the vatican and new zealand ? 
  how did france screw up rwanda though ? 
  hutu and tutsi managed to do that themselves . 
  france screwed up rwanda about as much as switzerland or sweden screwed up europe during wwii . 
  genuine question : how did ireland increase its industrial output so much ( 16.3 % in a year ) ? 
  even in outcomes , there are criteria that are n't telling about that , such as `` abortion rate '' ( ireland does n't allow abortion , but it does n't mean that their hospital and their healthcare system ca n't heal patients properly ) , `` depression '' , or `` potential years of life lost '' ( which depends a lot on stuff like smoking , drinking alcohol , being too fat etc. ) . 
  in access , i do n't get how `` direct access to specialist '' is a good or a bad thing , or tells anything about healing qualities of a country 's health system . 
   warehousing patients probably does n't create health if you ask me . 
  of course , and it 's expensive , which is why the amount of bed is going down in many rich countries as a tradeoff . 
  but this index ca n't really help you to know and compare the healing qualities of those countries ' healthcare systems and their hospitals . 
  if you look at the detailed [ list of criteria ] ( http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/ehci-2013/ehci-2013-index-matrix-a3.pdf ) used by the swedish think tank , there 's no wonder why bed quantity does n't correlate with the health consumer index . 
  out of 48 criteria , there are probably around 5 criteria that could be directly or indirectly affected by bed quantity . 
  there 's a wide distrust of market in france , which is why it 's quite uncommon . 
  hollande could be in this position , as many of the central leaning socialists , but he could n't publicly admit his business-friendliness , which is why he made claims like `` finance is my enemy '' . 
  how do you get someone that 's experimented enough to appear as a legitimate statesman or stateswoman , without having him in position of power before ? 
  it 's a subtle equilibrium . 
   his party stands for absolutely nothing . 
  he is standing for a political niche that will be empty after hollande . 
  he is basically the french equivalent to the british lib dems . 
  he 's both socially liberal and business-friendly . 
  his main political support is the mayor of lyon , g\u00e9rard collomb , who 's applying exactly this kind of policy since 15 years in his city . 
  the parties on its left ( m\u00e9lenchon and maybe the socialist party , depending on the winner of the primaries ) are socially liberal and not business-friendly , and fillon on its right is socially conservative and business-friendly , while the fn is nationalist . 
  there are two belgium ( and a [ mythical third one ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/communaut\u00e9_germanophone_de_belgique#/media/file:karte_deutschsprachige_gemeinschaft.svg ) , but its existence has less witnesses than nessie ) : a first belgium that looks like lille with a slight speech impediment , and a second belgium that does n't hate us as long as we avoid being confused with inhabitants from first belgium . 
  brussels is the capital of the first belgium , and is a surprisingly nice city . 
  second belgium hates first belgium because first belgium got factories back in the days , and thus second belgium felt left over . 
  now that those factories are gone , second belgium gets to spit on first belgium . 
  surprisingly , we hear more about monaco 's prince and princesses than about your king . 
  he should get into [ bobsleigh ] ( http://www.etv-sport.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/prince+albert+s+bobsleigh+race+48zyl1wz6fcl.jpg ) in order to seek fame . 
  chocolate is nice , med school is easy and beer is great ( and so is absinthe ) . 
  also , antwerp has the nicest train station on this continent , which makes up for the ridiculously cold sea . 
  manneken-pis is also extremely impressive , much more so than versailles , chambord or milan 's duomo . 
  the first belgian i met was a waiter that felt compelled to explain why i could n't order free tap water along with my freedom fries and mussels , as it had been imposed by napoleon and thus was evil . 
  getting mad at napoleon is hiding an obvious complex . 
  get over it . 
  french people do n't dream about napoleon since more than 150 years . 
  also , drinking tap water is healthy . 
  still , i have to admit that [ poelvoorde ] ( http://static.fnac-static.com/multimedia/images_intervenants/portraits/grand/8/7/371778_poelvoorde.gif ) 's , [ brel 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9fa9awfblm ) , [ magritte ] ( http://www.renemagritte.org/images/paintings/son-of-man.jpg ) 's , [ poirot ] ( http://www.rsdoublage.com/oeuvres/series/hercule_poirot.jpg ) 's , [ tintin ] ( http://referentiel.nouvelobs.com/file/14846352-radio-tintin-sur-les-ondes-de-france-culture.jpg ) 's and [ fran\u00e7ois l'embrouille ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlgwqnc6ekw ) 's homeland might be doing something right to breed such fellows . 
  you should add * forbidden games * ( by ren\u00e9 cl\u00e9ment , released in 1952 ) to your list .

  edit : and katyn , by andrzej wajda . 
  democratic institutions ca n't work properly with tribalism . 
  the standard of living for an engineer in france and an engineer in germany are almost equal and so is the pay . 
  unemployment rate for such a position is very low in both countries . 
  for example , the median salary for a process engineer [ in germany ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/de/job=process_engineer/salary ) is $ 49 000 , and $ 45 000 [ in france ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/fr/job=process_engineer/salary ) . 
  therefore , a french engineer might want to move to germany because he likes the country , its language or its culture , but he wo n't do it because the wage is higher . 
  at the same time , the median salary for a process engineer [ in the us ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/us/job=process_engineer/salary ) is $ 71 000 , which is significantly more ( about $ 67 000 ) . 
  [ in australia ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/au/job=process_engineer/salary ) , it 's au$ 83 449 ( about $ 57 000 ) and [ in switzerland ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/ch/job=process_engineer/salary ) about chf 92 000 ( about $ 85 000 ) . 
  a french engineer might move there to get a better wage than in france . 
  it 's even more likely when you consider that a significant part of switzerland speaks french , or that knowledge of english is much more common than knowledge of german among french engineers . 
   how do these economic migrants even survive in europe i wonder ? 
  some have undeclared work . 
  you 'll also get a hint about what those that do n't have undeclared work are doing by wandering around touristy cities like [ barcelona ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfdqrrioe40 ) , milan , rome , [ paris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg_qu53rq_0 ) etc. 
  poland ca n't have the influence the uk enjoyed . 
  ireland neither . 
   the uk has always preferred cooperation with the us over cooperation with its european partners . 
  brexit is the logical conclusion . 
  being in the eu is ( was ? ), 
  a great asset for the uk , including in their cooperation with the us . 
  that 's the main reason why the us wanted the uk to remain in the eu . 
  leaving the eu seems more coherent and honest if one dislikes the eu , but it does n't seem wise regarding one 's cynical self-interest . 
  it 's not necessarily easy , even if we disregard the language barrier , and it depends on the country we are talking about . 
  a young greek or spanish engineer might want to look for a job in germany , because he might not find one in greece or spain . 
  in france , on the other hand , those that have skills that might be interesting for a german employer such as engineers , medical doctors , lawyers that are fluent in german and both french and german law , or workers and technicians in high demand fields etc. 
  are n't struggling with unemployment . 
  a french engineer or doctor will find a fine job in france . 
  outside of personal interest for a specific country or the will to see the world , switzerland and maybe the usa or australia are the only countries where a french young engineer or doctor might have an interest to move . 
  high youth unemployment is mainly hitting people that would n't be interesting for a german employer . 
  i wo n't hold my breath for * nuit debout * though , the movement seems dead and never reached the popularity of the protests that foresaw * podemos * . 
  maybe * nuit debout * might resurrect if fillon becomes president and actually act like a thatcher wannabe , but that 's just speculation . 
  when it comes to explain why the youth might want to shake the system because they feel that the system is not giving them their chance , the relative number of young people that have found employment does n't really matter though . 
  a young person is n't going to get very angry against the state of the labour market while he is studying either at university or in vocational training . 
  during this time , it 's merely a scary thought , but not something to get really angry at . 
  the reality of the labour market is tough to foresee by someone who 's currently studying ( including vocational training ) . 
  this kind of anger really comes up when one is looking for a job but ca n't find one ( exactly what the rate is about ) , or only finds jobs that are below his expectations . 
  it 's more complex than that because there are cultural differences between people that matter a lot when it comes to crime . 
  `` immigrants '' is a gigantic category , and so is crime as a whole . 
  for example in france , corsicans ( which are not immigrants , but were a kind of a culturally homogeneous group that has differences with the rest of the country ) are much more likely to be involved in organized crime than the average french person , even after correcting for age , income , wealth or social status . 
  roma people ( another kind of homogenous cultural group ) are much more likely to be involved in theft of electrical cable or pickpocketing than the general population , even after correcting for age , income , wealth or any other factor . 
  forced marriages happen among immigrant groups from turkey , africa or some parts of asia . 
  they did n't happen among portuguese immigrants that used to be just as poor . 
  listen to [ what this ] ( https://youtu.be/tb2ifikowyu?t=10m20s ) former assistant commissioner of the met police has to say about london for example .
