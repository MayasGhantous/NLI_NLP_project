  there are still significant differences in crime outside of general factors such as age , gender or income . 
  looking at youth unemployment rate might give some insight . 
  in 2015 , ** germany ** had an ** unemployment rate of about 5 % ** . 
  its ** youth unemployment rate ** was about ** 7.3 % ** . 
  ** france ** had an ** unemployment rate ** of about ** 10 % ** . 
  its ** youth unemployment rate ** was about ** 24.7 % ** . 
  things did n't improve since then . 
  basically , the burden of unemployment in the french labour market is largely beared by young people . 
  on top of those being unemployed , many more young people are employed with insecure conditions , working limited-term contracts , whereas older working people are usually working under permanent contracts . 
  here again , the burden of insecurity in the french labour market is largely beared by young people . 
  in france , the main anti-establishment force is the fn , which promises attractive simplistic solutions . 
  notice how in italy , the fate of the youth is even worse ( ** 11 % ** overall unemployment , ** 40 % youth unemployment ** ) , which also led to the same kind of anti-establishment political niche being filled , in this case by the five star movement . 
  at the same time , the far left that could be filling this niche for angry people eager to change everything . 
  it tried to organize something like * nuit debout * , but ultimately is more disorganized than the far right . 
  if they had been successful , they could have become something akin to podemos . 
  also , they are pro-immigration , whereas there 's a rejection of immigrants and refugees among many young people ( according to a poll in 2015 , around 30 % of 18-35 yo were strictly opposed to receiving syrian refugees in france , and 26 % were somewhat opposed to receiving them ) . 
  i think that among different eu countries , the most important factor has been who was the most able to quickly fill the fancy `` modern '' anti-establishment niche . 
  it does n't come from different ideologies , but from a similar will to shake things up . 
  setting up a quota of 30 % foreign students in belgian medical universities is how you end up with 30 % of french students in the french-speaking part of belgium . 
  that would be much more without the quota !, 
  anyway , belgian 's way is drying up . 
  romania , portugal and croatia are the way to go now for those that failed the first year here . 
  they even started programs in french . 
  there are fewer medical students than needed in france because the * numerus clausus * was seen by the government as a way to limit health spendings during the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s . 
  this is much older than the trend of importing foreign doctors . 
  the idea was that the less there are medical doctors , the lower health spendings would be . 
  according to the * choussat report * in 1997 , there was an excess of doctors between 20 000 and 30 000 . 
  the government limited the number of new doctors per year to around 3500 between 1977 and 1997 , and 4500 after the report . 
  then in 2003 , thousands of old people died during the heat wave . 
  the government figured out that there was a significant lack of medical doctors . 
  thus , the government decided to increase the * numerus clausus * to around 8000 per year . 
  the * numerus clausus * has never been used as a way to limit spendings on medical students , or abuse other poorer countries . 
  spendings on a medical student in france are about 10 000 $ per year during the first 6 years , which is on par with the cost of an average student in any field . 
  after that , they become residents and are costing almost nothing , as they become a form of full-time cheap labour needed by public hospitals . 
  the rate of rejection at the end of the first year is 85 % . 
  a young person that has been rejected from medical school is going to study something else anyway , likely biology . 
  granted , his studies will probably be shorter than 6 years , but not by much . 
  there are 2.5 millions students in france . 
  the state could n't care less about having 4 or 5 times more students in medical school instead of another field . 
  it 's the result of poor planning during decades , not a policy aimed at freeloading the cost of training medical students . 
  i ca n't find a direct source with national statistics . 
  but i found out an article about the us and another about the uk . 
  in [ the uk ] ( http://fet.uwe.ac.uk/conweb/house_ages/council_housing/print.htm ) `` most pre-1919 corporation housing was built cheaply taking the form of high density tenement blocks of flats with small rooms and limited facilities including ** shared ** kitchen and ** toilets ** and no running hot water . '', 
  council houses started to be built with indoor toilets during the 1920s and 1930s , which was seen as a modern feature at the time . 
  [ in the us ] ( http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2004/data/papers/ss04_panel1_paper17.pdf ) : `` in 1940 nearly half of houses lacked hot piped water , a bathtub or shower , or a flush toilet . 
  over a third of houses did n't have a flush toilet . '', 
  both of those countries were more advanced than france , germany or belgium , and also much richer , with a gdp per capita about 40 % bigger . 
  also , you can have a description of two typical tenements in berlin in 1928 [ here ] ( https://books.google.fr/books?id=9ih79u3l6xkc&amp;pg=pa272&amp;lpg=pa272&amp;dq=germany+living+1930+toilet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jou30ugcyp&amp;sig=9y2boiujwbtoquvzh9llhvvmiyw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj8xev_gozrahufwbokhbnjdrgq6aeictap#v=onepage&amp;q=toilets&amp;f=false ) , that had 1 toilet for 14 or 17 residents , which means collective toilets . 
  `` of neuk\u00f6lln 's 5,412 parcels of built-up land , only 3,912 were connected to sewers in 1928 . 
  as it was just before the crisis , things should n't have changed much until 1936 . 
  obviously , toilets were certainly less common outside of a big city like berlin . 
  that 's exactly how a movement of panic would start . 
  imagine that you are rich , or a foreigner , and learn that you are probably going to lose your assets that are kept by monte dei paschi . 
  obviously , your first reaction would be to take those assets back before the bank 's bankruptcy . 
  many people would do the same thing at the same time , which would cause a bank default , with the bank 's bankruptcy as a result . 
  many people would also do the same thing in other banks at the same time , creating a systemic panic . 
  also , banks are interconnected . 
  the whole financial industry looks like a house of cards . 
  you ca n't remove a card without risking a wide collapse of the system , which is also deeply rooted to the real economy . 
  that 's why usually , when a small bank is at risk of bankruptcy , governments try to make sure that a bigger bank swallows this small bank at risk , because the situation as a whole is too risky . 
  if a big bank is struggling , then the government itself has to get involved . 
   i 'd argue that 2016 looks far more different from 1976 than 1976 does from 1936 . 
  the internet and computers are comparable to the printing press and steam engine . 
  it depends on where you live . 
  if you are talking about the center of new york or london , then may be . 
  if you are talking about average people living in industrialized countries , you would be wrong . 
  if you walked in an average house in 1936 in france or belgium or germany for example , you would have had to go outside to go to the toilets , you would n't have had a fridge , the mother would wash the clothes by hand , you would n't have had a phone , but there would have been one or two phones in the whole village or neighbourhood , average families did n't have a single car ( there were only 700 thousand cars in germany for 65 million people in 1936 ) , if you got sick there were n't antibiotics , if you wanted to go to the us or anywhere accross the sea , you would have taken a boat and several weeks , if you had a child in france , he had a risk of death of about 7.5 % during his first year , your life expectancy would have been around 55 yo etc. 
  it was a whole different world from 1976 . 
  now , if you or me had to go back from today to 1976 in belgium , france or germany , the main differencse would be way less tv chanels , and the lack of personal computers , the internet and mobile phones . 
  but the life was kind of the same inside the home outside of those innovations . 
  the risk of death of your child during his first year was about 1 % . 
  your life expectancy would be above 72yo . 
  there would be antibiotics , cars in every home , planes for long trips etc. . . 
  i 'm not saying that the internet and computers are less important than cars or indoor plumbing . 
  i 'm saying that it and new forms of entertainment are less of a revolution than the sum of the innovations that happened before the 1970s . 
  ( it 's not my idea , it comes from this [ highly recommended book ] ( http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10544.html ) ) . 
  i was n't talking about their place in automation . 
  i was talking about their place in the modern economy . 
   ca n't the government let them declare bankrupcy , but give each citizen whatever they had directly without intermediaries ? 
  it would be way more expensive and an incredible mess , while causing panic . 
  monte dei paschi di sienna has about $ 169 billions of assets on its balance sheet . 
  see how this bank is already an incredible mess for the italian government . 
  also , you ca n't set a precedent . 
  think about bigger banks in europe . 
  deutsche bank has about $ 1.6 trillions of assets , santander has about $ 1.3 trillions , bnp has about $ 2 trillions , hsbc has $ 2.4 trillions . 
   alternatively , if a bank gets bailed out , should n't it be automatically nationalized ? 
  if not you are privatizing benefits and nationalizing losses you know the [ answer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yeccgwn5ay ) . 
  a minimum would be to at least take back the bonuses of the bank 's ceo and executives . 
  mr. fuld led lehman brothers to bankruptcy and still walked out with about $ 300 million in pay and bonuses . 
  we ca n't yet figure out which impact automation will have on people as whole . 
  we are waiting for a kind of growth that will never come back . 
  the real problem for industrialised countries comes from the fact that the new engine of growth ( mainly it and entertainment ) is n't as important as the growth they got used to before the 1970s . 
  facebook , microsoft , google , apple * et alii * may look like a revolution , but they are n't driving a revolution on par with what happened between the 19th century and the 1970s ( cars , trains , planes , oil industry , pharmaceuticals and chemistry , phones , indoor plumbing everywhere , electricity , fridges etc. ) . 
  it 's not just about the difference between the employment of gm and facebook or google , it 's also because we had many significantly growing sectors at the same times , instead of one and a half . 
  the writer of this article is bill browder . 
  he made [ a conference ] ( https://youtu.be/sie-xjlitna?t=1s ) about this subject at the institute for advanced study ( a kind of open university without diplomas , which is a renowned research center , neighbouring the princeton university ) . 
  obviously , it 's just one side of the story , but nevertheless highly recommended . 
  they do n't want the kind of help we are providing them with , which is food and shelter or healthcare during the time they are asking for asylum . 
  they want to cross the channel , which is a kind of move that we wo n't do for obvious reasons . 
  keep in mind that those people are not the majority of the migrants that came to france to seek asylum .
