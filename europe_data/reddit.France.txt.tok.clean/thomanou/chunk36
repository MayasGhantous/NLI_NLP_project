  many more have accepted to seek help in france . 
  in 2015 for example , there were 6900 migrants in calais trying to move to the uk . 
  during the same year , 80 000 migrants asked for asylum in france . 
  between 1992 and today , more than one million people asked for asylum in france . 
  free day nursery , free and high quality schools , free and high quality universities , free healthcare ( including dental care or eyeglasses if needed ) should be the way to go to help people raise their children . 
  then you have the other public policies that are indirectly related , but nonetheless needed in order to provide children with a decent quality of life : safe and clean streets , which means a well funded police and a well funded judiciary , making sure that everyone has a roof over its head and food , clean air , clean water , a great sewer system , a great transportation system , access to energy etc. 
  in the end , there should n't be money to spend anymore . 
  people do n't get that if money is given to them in the form of direct social help , that 's also money that could have been used to improve their country and society as a whole , including the lives of the poorest people or their children . 
  they just see money flowing into their bank account . 
  money given directly in a family 's budget because they have children also means money that ca n't be spent on day care or schools . 
  you are right . 
  obviously , such a case is necessarily extremely technically complex . 
  the final ruling , whatever the decision might be , will be written on hundreds or thousands of pages . 
  nobody will read it except a small number of experts , and the public debate in the media will probably be closer to a smear debate than a legal debate about justice . 
  * thus , for apple 's side or ireland , it will be easy to paint it as being purely about legal technicalities abused by the eu in order to overstep on a country 's sovereignty . 
  * according to the us government , it will be painted as legal technicalities abused by the eu in order to wage an economic war on us multinationals , in an unilateral way , instead of trying to find a multilateral international treaty ( which the us would probably try to undermine anyway , but that wo n't be said ) . 
  * according to the eu , it will be painted as a fight against evil greedy multinationals that are abusing legal technicalities in order to avoid their fair share of taxes . 
   i imagine it can arrange for their upper tax bracket do they have tax brackets on corporate tax ? 
  usually , it 's proportional ( * i.e. 
  * a flat tax on net profit ) , not progressive , unlike income tax . 
  it can be interpreted as discriminating by the commission and the court of justice of the european union even if it is n't explicitely discriminatory , and thus struck down . 
  for example , france got into troubles during the 1980s for setting up a tax system that established heavier taxes on cars with more powerful engines , as the system was obviously discriminating against imported vehicles ( mainly german cars ) and made to protect french automobile manufacturers . 
  what do you mean ? 
  a whole generation of french kevin ( or dylan , brandon , jessica , bryan , jennifer ... ) can beg to differ as much as it wants , but their parents did the exact same mistake as many recent immigrants : making life unnecessarily harder for their children . 
  such a name does n't screams `` foreign '' , but screams `` poor and uneducated background '' , because it became trendy amongst people that name their children after characters of us tv shows . 
  a resume with the forename `` kevin '' has [ 10 to 30 % less chance to land a job ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/insolite/la-malediction-des-kevin-01-04-2015-1917538_48.php ) than the same resume with the forename `` arthur '' ( a name that became trendy at the same time but does n't became famous because of us tv shows ) . 
  absolutely . 
  overall , assimilation is an extremely complex issue , and our handling has often been flawed . 
  still , there 's an essential and symptomatic trend that is often missed , but appears obvious by looking at it in a historical perspective : names . 
  for example , if you look back at the french history of first or second generation immigrants during the last 150 years , when racism and xenophobia were much more obvious than today , there 'll be a lot of famous names that are considered by french people as absolutely french . 
  i take this example because that 's the one i know the best , but the same thing happened in other countries . 
  to name a few : [ jacques offenbach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacques_offenbach ) , [ \u00c9mile zola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9mile_zola ) , [ marie curie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_curie ) , [ guillaume apollinaire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillaume_apollinaire ) , [ marc chagall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marc_chagall ) , [ robert badinter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_badinter ) , [ serge gainsbourg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serge_gainsbourg ) , [ charles aznavour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_aznavour ) , [ \u00c9douard balladur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9douard_balladur ) , [ georges charpak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georges_charpak ) and even [ nicolas sarkozy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolas_sarkozy ) , [ albert uderzo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_uderzo ) and [ ren\u00e9 goscinny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ren\u00e9_goscinny ) , [ raymond kopa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raymond_kopa ) or [ michel platini ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_platini ) etc. 
  what do they have in common ? 
  it 's not a similar culture of origin , or similar political ideas , nor a similar language of origin nor a similar religion to the host country . 
  it 's the french first name . 
  many of them even changed their name to get a french first name . 
  if you want to be considered purely as french , take a french name , not a name that screams `` foreign '' . 
  if you want to be looked at as german , take a german name . 
  that should be the first step . 
  nowadays , this step is skipped . 
  that 's the first generation . 
  most of them do n't make much noise , try hard to fit in , are happy to live in peace even with a very low pay and a tough job according to european standards , because what they left was much tougher , be it war or extreme poverty . 
  they do n't believe that anything is owed to them . 
  they often do n't even fight back against many forms of racism or xenophobia . 
  they do n't fight back when their hosts look down upon their religion or culture . 
  then they 'll have children in their new country . 
  their children wo n't share the same beliefs . 
  they wo n't accept any form of racism or xenophobia because they are n't guest , but citizens , and would like to be considered as any other citizen . 
  they wo n't accept that their religion or their parents ' culture are openly criticized . 
  many wo n't accept a low pay and a tough job , but many wo n't succeed in school and on the job market because their parents are unable to provide them a significant cultural capital . 
  many will be kind of stuck between two cultures without being able to fit well in one of them . 
  many will look back at the country their parents left with rose-tinted glasses , and despise the country where they are citizen and live . 
  hopefully , many will be fine , fit well , succeed in school and land a good job , even become involved in politics etc. 
  still , as experiences of the past decades have shown , it 's not a given . 
  it 's not just france . 
  farmers are a strong political force in most european countries , be it spain , greece , germany , italy , poland etc. 
  farmers are powerful even in japan . 
  by the way , i know that french over subsidised agriculture is a common clich\u00e9 , but french [ agricultural output ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sites/agriculture/files/statistics/factsheets/pdf/eu_en.pdf ) is more than 18 % of the eu-28 total , while receiving slightly less than 17 % of cap subsidies , which means that french agriculture is slightly below the european average . 
  for example , polish agriculture 's output is slightly below 6 % of the european total , while receiving more than 9.6 % of cap subsidies . 
  it 's the european agriculture as a whole that is over subsidised . 
  japanese are experts in earthquakes . 
  agriculture is a very hot topic , and canada has farms . 
  also , many were scared by canada as an us trojan horse . 
  i agree with you about the second point , but the first kind of lobbyism bothers me . 
  if you bring a problem to a judicial court , you might call in experts , witnesses , and attorneys on both sides will give their arguments in the court , and then the judge or the jury will take his decision . 
  lying is forbidden . 
  there 's a strict proceeding established in order to have a wise decision in the end . 
  the work of elected politicians in commissions looks a lot like that , when they have to work on the ramifications of a decision : they call in experts in the field with different views , witnesses , ask for reports made by governmental agencies or do them themselves with investigating powers , they provide different arguments themselves too and are supposed to take a wise decision in the end . 
  lying is forbidden here too . 
  in this kind of institution , there 's also a strict proceeding in order to have a wise decision in the end . 
  that 's where politicians are supposed to be convinced . 
  in the first kind of lobbyism , there 's no sound proceeding : it 's informal , you hear arguments by self-proclamed experts and what 's worse is that every lobbyist can lie and often do lie . 
  it 's not as bad as corruption , but this is n't a sound democratic process at all . 
  there 's also the problem of corruption and money in politics . 
  there 's a ton of lobbyism in europe too . 
  the us political system seems to make the trend even worse . 
  in europe , typically , a corporate lobbyist will try to influence a politician by saying that if he does x or does n't do y , people will lose their job where he is elected , that it will be terrible for the economy etc. 
  in the us , lobbyists do that too . 
  but a politician also needs them to pay for his extremely expensive and privately funded campaign . 
   it 's the media 's fault for confusing these people . 
  media have their share of responsibility , especially considering how unethical some british newspapers are . 
  that can be a british problem . 
  but let 's be honest , the real problem was n't the dailymail and the sun . 
  it was n't british politicians either . 
  in an era of incredibly easily accessible information , this should n't be an excuse . 
  every single european treaty and decision taken by the eu can be found in less than 2 minutes online , as raw material that can be hard to understand and also as popularised forms that are much more accessible . 
  the same can be said about the british government and its policies . 
  the office for national statistics and eurostat are incredible sources to get a clear idea about the issues that were bothering them . 
  none of them bothered to check that . 
  actually , in every democracy , only a mere negligible minority does , despite the fact that most people spent more than a decade in school and should be able to do so . 
  even the majority of the college educated crowd could n't bother to do so . 
  marc sangnier ( a french politician from the beginning of the xxth century , but who he was does n't really matter ) defined democracy as `` the choice of taking the citizen 's consciousness and responsibility to its highest level '' . 
  well , the highest level seems out of reach . 
  exactly , even a lack of knowledge of how many people live in europe . 
  to suspect doping happening during the biggest events of professional sports has nothing to do with `` post-truth '' or `` fascism '' . 
  if you are waiting for evidence ~ ~ s ~ ~ , you 'll have to wait a long time , because either wada 's efficiency at finding evidence ~ ~ s ~ ~ is n't very impressive , or somehow the olympic games are extraordinarily clean . 
  for example , between 1968 and 2010 , only [ 5 cases of doping in olympic cycling ] ( http://sportsanddrugs.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceid=004420 ) have been reported . 
  between 1968 and 2013 , on the * tour de france * : out of 10 000 cyclists , about 3 000 participants got caught doping during their career . 
  out of 45 winners , 38 got caught ( [ source in french ] ( http://www.lepoint.fr/dossiers/sport/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-dopage-8-000-participants-3-000-tricheurs-09-07-2013-1702258_1606.php ) ) . 
  and everyone knows that antidoping measures on the * tour * are far from being perfect .
