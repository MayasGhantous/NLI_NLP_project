  your weather is awful , your beaches are awful , your food is awful , and your highest mountain is the ben nevis , which is at most a big hill . 
  your main team also got beaten by iceland . 
  honestly , this is extremely unfair . 
  italy 's weather is nice , has nice beaches , its food is third to none and its highest mountain is the mont blanc , albeit the worst part . 
  italy got barely beaten by germany after an epic penalty shoutout . 
  france/italy rivalry seems much more fair to me . 
  your link is n't about the total number of asylum-seekers . 
  it 's about the `` emergency relocation mechanism '' . 
  most asylum-seekers are n't relocated and thus do n't appear in this document . 
  in a democracy based on equality , you are supposed to treat everyone as equal individuals before the law . 
  this idea is as old as democracy itself . 
  for example in pericless ' funeral oration as reported by thucydides :  `` if we look to the laws , they afford equal justice to all in their private differences ; if to social standing , advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity , class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit ; nor again does poverty bar the way : if a man is able to serve the state , he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition . '', 
  obviously , at the time , only men were considered as citizens . 
  still , according to the democratic ideal , they had to be treated as individuals , not as members of a group . 
  accordingly , you 'll also find that discriminations are forbidden by our texts of fundamental rights , such as article 21 from the * eu charter of fundamental rights * , article 7 from the udhr , or article 14 from the echr . 
  according to cambridge dictionary , `` discrimination '' means : '' ** treating a person or particular group of people differently ** , especially in a worse way from the way in which you treat other people , ** because of their ** skin colour , ** sex ** , sexuality , etc. '', 
  such a quota does n't treat people as individuals that are equal before the law . 
  it treats people as members of a group . 
  here , this group is defined on the ground of sex and is being treated differently on that specific ground . 
  doing so is directly opposed to one of the pillars of an ideal and just democracy . 
  some might call it `` affirmative action '' , but it is strictly speaking a form of discrimination . 
  also , there 's a second criticism because it involves a problem of method and it 's a slippery slope . 
  how do they know that there is a significant proportion of women that are barred from entering parliament due to discrimination ? 
  actually , they do n't know that . 
  they just know that in parliament , women are underrepresented in comparison to men . 
  therefore , they use quotas to promote women . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm also sure that in every single european parliament , roma people are extremely underrepresented . 
  are we going to use quotas to promote roma people in parliaments ? 
  in france , black people and arabs are severly underrepresented in parliament in comparison to their share of the population , should we set a quota for them ? 
  and what about religions ? 
  jewish people are overrepresented whereas muslims are underrepresented in the french parliament . 
  do we need a religious quota too ? 
  and what about old people vs young people too ? 
  people fighting discrimination are blind to the fact that they are themselves a source of discrimination . 
  sadly , courts such as the echr , the ecj or national supreme courts wo n't move against this , because their reasoning will be blinded by the same ideology . 
  that would be much better to stick with treating people as individuals . 
  i 'd say that the average french citizen considers putin as a dictator , and russia as a moderate threat to eastern europe . 
  a strong majority dislike putin a lot . 
  still , keep in mind that french people usually do n't mind too much when the government is dealing with dictators . 
  only some left-leaning people are strongly opposed to these kinds of deals . 
  most people were annoyed when our allies forced us to cancel the mistrals ' selling to russia . 
  there is also a small minority of far-right leaning people that believe that putin is a manly and strong leader . 
  will turkey join the eu before uk leaves ? 
  if the answer is no , then it does n't matter that the uk is still in the eu . 
  every sane person on this continent knows that turkey wo n't join any time soon , if ever . 
  let me use an analogy . 
  usually , it 's normal for a married couple to discuss about what each member is doing even in his personal life . 
  if the wife decides to quit a high paying job to become a teacher , it 's perfectly normal for the husband to say to her what he thinks about said decision before she acts . 
  it 's neither arrogant nor provocative , because this decision does n't involve just the wife 's personal life , but the couple 's life . 
  it 's not a form of interference . 
  now imagine that a husband says to his wife that he 's asking for a divorce . 
  then the wife decides to quit a high paying job to become a teacher . 
  by the way , she 'll probably leave the high paying job after the divorce . 
  legally speaking , they are still married . 
  do n't you think that if her husband , who 's going to become her ex-husband , tries to get involved in her decision 's process , she 'll find that arrogant and provocative , as a form of interference ? 
  do you think that the husband will have a solid argument by saying that `` legally speaking , we are still married , so i get a say on this '' ? 
   various german politicians up to and including the chancellor suggested that it would be best for the uk to remain in the eu , which was entirely reasonable a position to express , and the uk is entirely reasonable to express the view that is being expressed here . 
  that 's not the same thing as talking about turkey joining the eu . 
  that 's akin to the married couple discussing about the divorce , with the wife saying that the husband should n't leave her . 
  both parties are involved , it 's normal and legitimate . 
  on the other hand , when obama said that the uk should n't leave the eu , it was n't exactly well received by the british public , because he did n't have the legitimacy to interfere in such matter . 
   it is a purely arrogant provocation from johnson when he is telling us what we have to do . 
  you did n't understand what weber finds insulting as said in this sentence . 
  if a country wants to leave the eu , it 's fine . 
  but then , this country does n't get a say on which country should join the eu or not . 
  it 's not this country 's call to make , it 's the sole business of the eu . 
  boris johnson is interfering in eu 's business . 
  of course , the uk did n't leave the eu yet , but it is supposed to , at least according to their government . 
  that 's why weber uses a `` we '' for the eu minus the uk . 
  the german foreign minister does n't say that scotland should remain in the uk or become independent . 
  if he was doing so , the uk would find that insulting . 
  when de gaulle did exactly that in [ qu\u00e9bec ] ( https://youtu.be/0l1eynohy1a?t=6m2s ) in 1967 , canada took it as an insult for obvious reasons : it is a foreign interference . 
  boris johnson is interfering in eu 's business . 
   no doubt the uk will continue to push that forward outside of the eu too ( as the us does for that matter ) . 
  exactly . 
  that is foreign interference , which is perceived as provocative and arrogant by any victim of such kind of interference . 
  it 's not daft , it 's normal and legitimate . 
  boris johnson is n't a barrister defending different clients with different interests . 
  he is n't a civil servant that might have to enforce policies that contradict his own set of beliefs and ideas either . 
  he 's a politician in a democracy . 
  of course , there 's always a difference between being in campaign and being in power , which leads to numerous necessary shifts and concessions . 
  [ weber ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.vision.org/uploadedimages/home/articles/2004fall_max-weber-a-compulsion-for-work.jpg ) is aware of that . 
  still , the position of boris johnson about turkey joining the eu is n't a mere compromise , but blatant hypocrisy . 
  from the eu point of view , this is insulting . 
  weber is also aware of that . 
  about 15 % less foreign tourists came in paris during q1 and q2 , while the sector should be growing ( as it is in spain , italy or portugal currently ) . 
  between january and april , only half of the usual number of japanese came . 
  considering that tourism makes up around 7 % of french gdp , it 's not insignificant . 
  it also caused lower attendance levels at bars , restaurants or events when those were n't straight up cancelled like the [ lille flea market ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/lille-braderie-cancelled-biggest-flea-market-in-europe-cancelled-amid-security-fears-a7173456.html ) or [ lyon 's * f\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res * ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/20/lyon-cancels-fete-des-lumieres-in-wake-of-paris-attacks ) . 
  ( also , keep in mind that by `` healthy growth '' a frenchman means about 2 % a year . ), 
  it makes sense to substract eu 's spending here though , because your government will likely pick up that bill himself after brexit . 
  for example , it would be surprising if british farmers do n't receive any subsidies anymore . 
  same in france . 
  it 's called `` abuse of rights '' . 
   maybe they could try a different approach to make things fair and just lower corporate taxes . 
  then you 'll find out that low is never low enough until you reach a level so low than tax lawyers are more expensive than the taxes you are paying . 
  if germany decides to set up a mere 8 % corporate tax rate , a tax haven will legally propose even less than that . 
  multinationals would still find it worth it to go in said tax haven instead of germany . 
   collect taxes on dividends instead .
