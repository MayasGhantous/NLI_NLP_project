  * vanilla latte * [ for example ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/17/news/companies/sugar-coffee-drinks/ ) contains more than 8 teaspoons of added sugar , and one of their drink even contains the equivalent of 25 teaspoons of sugar . 
   black water it 's not only overpriced black water . 
  there 's also a ton of sugar in it . 
  average joes need to be informed and have to focus during hours or days to make good decisions on complex issues . 
  the best example is the way criminal juries work . 
  managing to do the same thing with the whole electorate as with a small selected jury is tricky . 
   i remember sleeping on the beach in a sleeping bag . 
  ca n't say for sure for the 70s and the 80s , but nowadays it 's illegal to camp on a beach even without a tent , unless the local mayor allows it , which is very uncommon . 
  you 'll risk a 38 $ fine for doing so and the police will expel you from the beach . 
   they took my pocket knife most knives were forbidden , but * de facto * people were allowed to carry knives smaller than the hand 's palm . 
  the police would seize bigger knives . 
  * de jure * , any knife 's blade which could be blocked even like an [ opinel ] ( http://www.opinel.com/sites/default/files/produit/boutique/ndeg08_olive_wood_web_0.jpg ) was forbidden during the 70s and the 80s . 
  they were maybe unpolite , but it seems that they only enforced the law . 
  if automatization leads to millions of people unemployed in spain , uk and france , it will probably lead to billions of people unemployed accross the world . 
  having slightly less or slightly more than 0.8 % of the world 's population wo n't be the main problem . 
  as everyone knows , the uk is the main exporting force of the eu , being pulled down by countries like germany . 
  the eu is the limit to british exports . 
  leave the eu , then only the sky would be the limit . 
   germany , france and other large eu nations will always be very influential , much more so than smaller members . 
  the german , the french or any other european electorate are n't homogeneous . 
  if the european parliament was truely holding the power in the eu , instead of the states themselves tweaking a technocratic structure , the opposition would n't be about countries anymore . 
  the division would be more like between a conservative european party against a social democratic party for example . 
  it is a possibility that the conservative would lean more toward northern europe and germany , whereas the socialists would be leaning toward southern europe , but they would have voters everywhere nevertheless . 
  currently , germany is strong , but a small country like luxembourg is also incredibly powerful in a union of 500 millions people . 
  to be honest , saying that the eu is hindering free trade between state members and the rest of the world is ridiculous , except for farmers from the rest of the world . 
  free trade lies at the core of the eu . 
  pensions yes , but not the local healthcare system , which people tend to use much more as they get old . 
   to be a net contributer one needs to earn # 36000 . 
  sure , if you are born in the country , raised in it and went to the countriy 's schools and universities during more than 20 years before becoming productive . 
  or if you spend your retirement there , and need to use the countriy 's public hospitals . 
  a young worker coming after his studying years and living before retirement is probably a net contributor even if he earns less than # 36000 . 
  the [ gbp/usd ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=2y# ) and the [ dkk/usd ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=dkk&amp;to=usd&amp;view=2y ) exchange rates changed a lot . 
  the value of the us dollar increased a lot in one year . 
  the `` growth ( eur ) % '' column is wrong though , it 's just euro , not a percentage . 
  it 's after taxes , same numbers as [ insee ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1565 ) . 
   many people believe that auschwitz was run by poles to kill jews who ? 
  everyone knows that auschwitz was run by nazi germany . 
  at least if we only consider the people who believe that earth is n't flat . 
  also , i 'll probably prefer britain leaves the eu if : * i am an europohile but i believe that since their entrance in the eu , the uk kept us from moving toward a deeper integration . 
  that can explain some of the low score in belgium , france or the netherlands . 
  also , a brexit wo n't probably change much for any belgian , french and dutch people working accross the channel or wanting to visit the uk . 
  what you said about the french authorities ' views on foreign policy is true , but it 's not like if germany was really helping to push such a view on the european scene . 
  thus , there wo n't be a shift in the german position considering that they were n't really helping before valls ' statement . 
  also , france has always been the main force against a real european army , which is why the hypothesis of a french government trying to transform the eu according to the french etatism is a bit far from the truth . 
  the french agriculture is the first recipient of money from the eu because it is the biggest in europe . 
  the current protest of french peasants is n't directed against people who are n't getting eu money . 
  it is mainly aimed at german slaughterhouses which use an underpaid eastern european workers , and it was aimed before at spanish orchards relying on underpaid eastern europeans and north africans . 
  social dumping coming from a poorer country is annoying , but social dumping coming from a richer country which rely on a foreign workforce can be considered as unfair competition . 
  about the world outside of the eu , there is no way for any european producer in many agricultural sectors to compete with the us or the brazilian agriculture . 
  reforms wo n't change this fact . 
  any form of low quality agricultural product in europe is condemned without the eu subsidy policy . 
  i do n't think that the german position on the eu , as a whole , is to follow and help france , or at least try a bit to please france . 
  germany is currently undeniably one of the countries benefitting the [ most from the eu ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/germany-denmark-benefit-most-from-internal-market/ ) . 
  well , les r\u00e9publicains is the second biggest establishment party , and the fn has a significant part of the electorate . 
  it 's more like saying that `` the mainstream republicans '' and the `` tea party '' share the position of the democrats on this specific issue . 
  i 'm quoting them because if the socialist government 's standpoint is shared with the right and the extreme right , it is very unlikely to be challenged anytime soon . 
  the extreme left and the ecologists are n't going to make a government during the next years . 
  it 's not just about a ruling class change . 
  it 's also an important cultural shift , and both of those changes were enough to shake society as a whole . 
  literacy did n't disappeared , and latin was kept by the church . 
  still , even if we ca n't know how literacy was spread among the people during the era , we know that contrary to the roman times when rulers knew how to write and read in both latin and greek , most rulers could n't read or write in any language anymore . 
   there was no great collapse , at least not an apocalyptic one . 
  you are right , that 's why talking about the `` dark ages '' is an overstatement . 
  it was n't that chaotic , but it was still worse than during the roman empire . 
  from your books ' review by the [ independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-tribes-of-britain-by-david-miles-301427.html ) :  but miles argues that this did not happen quite as once believed . 
  saxon fighters came , yes ; but their `` invasion '' was more an immigration than a conquest , assimilating to the local native population over time . 
  that is what the archaeology of berinsfield in oxfordshire suggests , as does the linguistic evidence of place names . 
  though the culture of south-east england became saxon , says miles , `` genetically perhaps two-thirds of the population were of british descent '' . 
  nobody is saying the countrary . 
  the population that was already there did n't got replaced . 
  it does n't mean that tribes did n't came in . 
  which is why the term of `` barbarian invasions '' is a misnomer , but the term of migration is n't . 
  still , that 's the government 's position . 
  hollande almost did n't talk about the refugee 's crisis since the time when the quota system appeared to be a dead end , half a year ago . 
  if valls says so and the president does n't blame him for it , he 's just used as vanguard . 
  considering that les r\u00e9publicains and the fn share such opinion , then it 's the french position . 
  how much help does germany or the eu provide for french operations in the mena region currently ? 
  the real support is provided by the usa , not by germany . 
  also the `` german support over resistance to reforming the eu along british lines '' is not that high . 
  currently , france is giving 1.6 billion $ , italy almost 1.2 billion $ and spain 800 millions $ to finance the british rebate of 1983 . 
  germany is paying 380 millions , which is as much as belgium . 
  how is it a misnomer ? 
  `` barbarian invasions '' can be considered as a misnomer , but `` migration period '' not so much . 
  the vandals , an eastern germanic tribe , settled in spain and north africa ; the franks migrated from germany to current france and belgium ; saxons , angles and jutes went from northern germany and denmark to great britain etc. 
  the carolingian renaissance was n't close to what the roman empire used to be , it was just much better than the situation which happened between the fall of the roman empire and the carolingian : population , wealth , knowledge , literacy , arts were all much lower than during the roman empire . 
  by the way , the era in-between lasted for almost four centuries . 
  before , women could n't vote . 
  therefore , men could be considered as the only people that mattered politically . 
  as almost all of them were white in europe , or considering the fact that black people almost could n't vote in the usa ( and the white were the majority anyway ) , white men were strictly speaking the majority in europe and north america . 
  now , with women being more than half of the electorate , and a growing number of non white minorities , white men can be considered as a minority even in europe and north america . 
  despite the fact that the nordic countries and the uk are as rich as any of the 6 concerned states , they are not included . 
  the difference is more about willingness than about wealth . 
   the french do n't surrender that easily . 
  never thought i would read that on reddit by a brit during my life time . 
   a lot of different professions are protesting ( farmers , lawyers , doctors , engineers ) . 
  do the lawyers , doctors and engineers protest in the same happy way ? 
   the integration of muslims is not working out so well in the western europe . 
  it 's very hard to get an exhaustive view of the situation . 
  as it is a very complex and hot topic since years or even decades , most media that are reporting about it have a strong bias in one direction or another . 
  for example , just look at british newspapers .
