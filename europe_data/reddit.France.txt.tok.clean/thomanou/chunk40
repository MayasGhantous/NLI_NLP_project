  italy is even threatening to issue 200 000 temporary visas to get rid of them !, 
  it 's not working properly as of now , with no sign of improvement in sight . 
  think about a possible civil war in a populous country like nigeria or egypt and it 's obvious that it would n't work at all . 
   a small price so we could be sure we do n't accidentally kick out someone in real need of protection . 
  unless it leads to the end of shengen , which would n't be a small price . 
  or unless these millions of people without proper education and skills needed in our economies that already have noticeable unemployment rates end up poor , unemployed , overrepresented in crime rates , a burden for the taxpayer , poorly integrated , and the share of their children that wo n't succeed will deeply resent our societies . 
  also , populism rising in european countries largely because of animosity against third world immigrants , which already played a significant role in the uk deciding to leave the eu . 
  that would n't be such a small price in the end . 
  in 2015 , [ 530 000 non-eu citizens were issued with an order to leave ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/pdfscache/37449.pdf ) an eu member state . 
  only about 194 000 of them have done so . 
  now , you have to add the hundreds of thousands of people that came here and stayed illegaly , but managed to remain undocumented . 
  by the way , in 2015 , italy issued [ 27 305 orders ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:non-eu_citizens_ordered_to_leave_member_states\u2019_territories,_2008\u201315.png ) to leave the eu . 
  in comparison , the uk issued 70 020 orders to leave , france issued 79 950 and greece 104 575 . 
  considering that actual return happen on average in a third of the orders issued , italy is n't really sending a lot of them back to where they came from . 
  there are [ more nigerians ] ( https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean ) that arrived in italy since the beginning of the year than people sent back from there to any place in the world . 
  they should n't be sent back to libya . 
  they should be sent back to nigeria , guinea , ivory coast , bangladesh , gambia , senegal , morocco ... 
  if it was just about people from syria and other war torn countries , there would n't be any unmanageable crisis . 
  the difference is that europe , including russia , ended up with 700 millions inhabitants . 
  subsaharian africa already has a billion of inhabitants , and is supposed to reach 2 billions by 2050 , and almost 4 billions by 2100 , when europe should still have about 700 millions inhabitants . 
  the causes of the trend are the same . 
  the consequences will be much worse regarding africa . 
  fingernails , obviously . 
  you do n't see the huge quantities of manure though . 
  when in rome , do as the romans do . 
  being dressed like that is more akin to a weird : when in rome , do as you want , because the romans are more tolerant than you . 
  luxembourg would need to double its number of births to just have as much births as net migration . 
  current situation is n't just an easy way in comparison to family politics . 
  family politics just ca n't achieve a similar result . 
  luxembourg ca n't have it both ways : attracting thousands of jobs from activities deeply tied to other countries from the eu , alongside massive wealth , which is luxembourg 's current business model , while also keeping away immigrants from said countries . 
   this reeks of a code word for immigrant gang crime . 
  because it is . 
  french media have a ridiculous usage of the word '' * jeunes * '' ( * youths * ) since decades . 
  they also tried a fiber-optic network . 
  [ in 1984 ] ( http://fresques.ina.fr/mitterrand/fiche-media/mitter00148/biarritz-elysee-son-et-lumiere-sur-l-avenir-des-communications-en-france.html ) , 1500 homes in the city of biarritz got connected . 
  it provided regular-phone , minitel , 15 tv channels , several channels of `` high fidelity pictures '' , a network for computers and a `` visio-phone '' , which was a system of videoconferencing . 
  the system has been used to try video-on-demand and interactive television . 
  sadly , optical fibers were expensive back then , and it remained a geographically limited experiment , whereas the minitel has been generalized . 
  * the telegraph * takes an off remark made by an anonymous elys\u00e9e official to * le monde * , modifies it ( `` too complex for a kind of q&a tv interview '' , which really tends to simplify things , becomes `` too complex for journalists '' ) and makes it a quote from macron himself . 
  pulitzer-worthy right here . 
  the war was awful , and rebuilding the continent was a titanic job . 
  on the other hand , such extreme circumstances allowed some people that were bigger than life and determined to improve our societies to rise above the crowd . 
  the cia prefered to waterboard people abroad , instead of doing so on us soil , in order to avoid legal hurdles . 
  hence the so-called `` black sites '' . 
  a dominant position is to be found considering a company 's market share in a ** relevant market ** . 
  according to eu law , the relevant market is defined by the combination of a ** relevant product market ** and of a ** relevant geographic market ** . 
  definition of the relevant [ product market ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv%3al26073 ) :  a relevant product market comprises all those products and/or services which are regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer by reason of the products ' characteristics , their prices and their intended use personal computers or smartphones running on apple 's os are not a relevant product market . 
  the relevant product market would be personal computers or smartphones , because consumers consider that a macbook is interchangeable or substituable with a dell/hp/asus / toshiba laptop running on windows or linux ; or that an iphone is interchangeable or substituable with an android smartphone from sony/samsung/htc . 
  apple only has a minority share within both of these markets . 
  thus , apple is not in a dominant position , and therefore ca n't abuse a dominant position . 
  on the other hand , microsoft is in a dominant position within the os market for personal computers , and google is in a dominant within internet search engines . 
  edit : just to make it clearer : microsoft received flak from the commission because it tied internet explorer to windows on pcs , where it had a dominant position . 
  on the other hand , doing the same on windows phones was n't a problem , because windows phones are not in a dominant position . 
  an abuse of dominant position is n't illegal because the doing is illegal * per se * . 
  it becomes illegal , because the offender enjoys a dominant position ( usually  50 % of market shares ) , which means that its market power is strong enough to affect significantly the competition . 
  only then , the doing might become abusive . 
  apple is not in a dominant position , as it has a small market share , therefore apple ca n't be abusing a dominant position . 
  microsoft has already been found guilty of abusing its dominant position [ by the commission ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/ict/microsoft/ ) , and had to pay hefty fines , for example because microsoft tied internet explorer to windows . 
  we are talking about the right to a fair trial and prohibition of torture . 
  we are not talking about something abusively called `` human rights '' . 
  that would be complicity of torture , which would be an awful crime in itself . 
  i do n't know how it works in german law , but in french law , an accomplice is liable to the same punishment as the main crime . 
  no , it applies to everybody . 
  nobody should be tortured even after having been convicted . 
  even if you have been found guilty of the outrageous murder of two little girls , you still keep the right to a fair trial if you are being prosecuted for a third one . 
  and even if you are a merciless and convicted terrorist responsible of the death of many innocents , you ca n't receive a punishment for anything without law . 
   which ones ? 
  prohibition of torture , right to a fair trial , including being presumed innocent until proven guilty , no punishment without law . 
  he did n't say that the whole ee betrayed the eu . 
  the journalist 's question was :  `` europe seems at sixes and sevens . 
  a division between east and west reappeared . 
  in the east , some countries have designated authoritarian regimes . 
  how to manage such a divided europe ? '', 
  macron answered :  `` i do n't believe in this conflict between eastern and western europe . 
  there are tensions , because our collective imaginaries and our recent histories are n't the same . 
  i wo n't forget this sentence of bronislaw geremek , that i met about twenty years ago at the time of european enlargement : `` europe does n't get how much it owes to us . '', 
  for his generation , which was strongly attached to the europe of the enlightenment , western europe had betrayed when they let a wall being built and the continent dividing itself . 
  nowadays , when i hear ** some european leaders , they betray twice ** . 
  they decide to give up the principles , to turn their back at europe , to have a cynical approach toward the union , which would only be useful to spend its funds without having to respect its values . 
  europe is n't a supermarket . 
  europe is a common destiny . 
  it becomes weaker when it allows its principles to be rejected . 
  european countries that disrespect the rules have to draw their political conclusions . 
  and it 's not just an eastern-western debate . 
  i 'll talk with everybody and with respect , but i wo n't compromise on europe 's principles , on solidarity and on democratic values . 
  if europe accepts this , it means that europe is weak and has already disappeared . 
  it 's not my choice . '', 
  he 's obviously saying that orban and pis are betraying the eu , not that eastern europe as a whole betrayed the eu . 
  well , there 's also the problem of misinformation ( this bloomberg article is fine ) . 
  i 've seen many articles being posted and widely commented on this sub about macron and poland . 
  they usually have been so heavily [ editorialized , mistranslated or partial ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ixusl/emmanuel_macron_some_should_understand_that/ ) that macron appears to be much more agressive and simplistic than what he said . 
   he completely ignores the rest of europe or , in the case of central europe , he openly attacks it . 
  how is macron ignoring the rest of europe , when he already talked to european institutions , the leaders of germany , belgium , netherlands , luxembourg , italy , spain , the visegrad 's group , the uk , greece , ireland , denmark , estonia and bulgaria ? 
  he also met trump , canada 's prime minister , india 's prime minister , putin , morocco 's king and many others . 
  he has been elected less than two months ago and got his parliamentary majority a week ago . 
  you should wait a bit before saying that he 's ignoring the rest of europe . 
  the question was :  `` europe seems at sixes and sevens . 
  a division between east and west reappeared . 
  in the east , some countries have designated authoritarian regimes . 
  how to manage such a divided europe ? '',
