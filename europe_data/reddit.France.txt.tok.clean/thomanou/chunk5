  * the economist * usually considers that migrants are always a bliss on the economic standpoint , no matter what , no matter where they come from , no matter who they are despite the fact that migrants coming from somalia for example have a very low employment rate ( [ less than 30 % in the netherlands ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/nr/rdonlyres/cf430ff1-4623-4d60-b34b-cbe33749006a/0/2012b72pub.pdf ) ) . 
  * the guardian * adds in the moral duty to help poor foreign people , once again no matter what . 
  on the other hand , * the sun * or * the dailymail * will just spill their hate about migrants no matter what , even including lies . 
  not a single big newspaper seems to be really measured . 
  the polarization is extreme in british newspapers , but it 's not that far in other western european countries like germany . 
  in france , there 's even a ban on statistics based on ethnicity , and religion is a hot topic , which means that it 's extremely hard to study the subject . 
  if it 's hard to get a grip of the subject in my own country , then it 's even harder to get a grip of it in a foreign country . 
  i 'd say that it 's not working well , but it 's still working to some extent , and even very well for a significant part of the muslim immigrants . 
  why did the netherlands lost so many jobs ? 
   reading this from journalist in reputable newspaper is serius wtf . 
  the author was a conservative and eurosceptic member of parliament and is a columnist for [ * the sun * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sun_ ( united_kingdom ) , not a journalist for the * nyt * . 
  the situation got out of control just a [ few years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_italy#/media/file:migranti_sbarcati_in_italia_1997-2014.png ) , when lybia collapsed and syria fell into civil war , not when schengen was put up . 
  we were n't talking about an unmanageable influx of people trying to go accross the mediterranean in 2007 , when schengen was already up and running since decades . 
  you are suggesting that schengen is the cause of the migration , it is n't . 
  if we suppress schengen , the situation wo n't magically become the pre-shengen situation . 
  also , during the 1990 's , northern italy was n't just on the path of the migrants , but one of the places where they were going to live and work ( cf. 
  martelli law in 1990 and dini law in 1994 ) , which is why they did n't have a camp at the time . 
  france was even , paradoxically , their [ entrance door ] ( https://books.google.fr/books?id=qlxpqn0nsd0c&amp;pg=pa43&amp;lpg=pa43&amp;dq=vintimille+migrants+1990&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vi00pgglsf&amp;sig=9unnmvzbsnabm6ulqoxx9y1hqg8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjx-tt_h_dkahxilxokhb4fbaa4chdoaqgsmau#v=onepage&amp;q=vintimille%20migrants%201990&amp;f=false ) around nice and ventimiglia . 
  edit : changed the link from the economist which was behind a pay wall to wikipedia ], 
  it proves that if a country puts up a security at his border , the problem is n't erased but moved toward the previous country . 
  if we suppress schengen and put up security controls at each european country 's borders , we 'll just move the camps and the migrants toward the first countries which are italy and greece . 
  we ca n't go further than italy and greece , because they ca n't stop the boats anyway . 
  the situation will be unbearable for them , again . 
  and how did the example of calais proved your point ? 
  it 's a success ? 
  i hope it is , because the same thing in greece would be 100 times bigger . 
  a fine example of layered security at work : the jungle of calais . 
  just look at the [ erytreans ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/visuel/2014/10/13/voyage-en-barbarie-dans-le-desert-du-sinai_4501271_3212.html ) trying to go to israel or europe . 
  between 2009 and 2014 , 50 000 of them traveled through the sinai . 
  many of them have been kidnapped , ransomed and even tortured by bedouins to force their family living in sweden or elsewhere to pay . 
  10 000 erytreans have been killed during the process . 
  add in the risk of traveling accross a desert , giving all your meagre money to violent smugglers , and go accross the mediterranean in an overcrowded boat that barely fleet . 
  risking to be stuck in greece is merely an annoyance in comparison . 
  crisis can always happen , unemployment soar , income can go down etc. 
  germany is very wealthy and solid currently , but a pension system has to be prepared for any kind of economic crisis . 
  if the adjustment is n't automatic , then the political problem can be huge , and even emphasized considering the political power of the retired electorate . 
  a political debate to adjust the system will take a long time even if it is successful in the end , leading to debt at least during the time of the debate , which means putting the burden of current pensions on the shoulders of future and less numerous generations . 
  it 's not necessarily automatic nowadays , especially if you consider that the second group has nukes and not the first one for example , or that the first group ( switzerland ) agreed to never invade the second group ( liechtenstein ) . 
  also , the example is very schematic and does n't take into account tons of parameters . 
  but in a different context , like during most of history and probably even before that , you 'll more likely end up with the first group dominating the second group . 
  what i said is n't necessarily relevant for what will happen in the future in our advanced society where technology is growing incredibly fast . 
  but it 's an attempt to understand how we became `` conditioned into thinking that more = better '' . 
  in the same way , why do men think much more about having sex than women ? 
  the reason is that since the begining of mankind , only 40 % of men reproduced themselves against 80 % of women . 
  a woman was very likely to have children even if she was n't actively looking for a partner , therefore the women who had `` actively looking for a partner '' as character are n't more likely to have children than the women who lacked such a trait . 
  thus , this character is not that much spread among women . 
  for men , such a trait is a big advantage in terms of likeliness to have children . 
  therefore , this trait is spread among men . 
  hehe . 
  ca n't talk for liechtenstein , but the french overseas territories have probably the same rate as south italy or close to it sadly . 
  the problem is that compulsory military service has very low value on the military point of view as you said ( unless it lasts for years like in israel ) , it 's expensive , and it 's also a waste of time for the well integrated part of the population which is still the majority . 
   what is an example of a system that has collapsed due to zero population growth ? 
  maybe japan . 
  let 's say that you have two human groups competing : * one of them has a culture ( for example a religion , or even a genetical character , whatever ) which tells them that more is better : more money , more power , more children , more land etc. 
  * the other group has a culture which teach that more is n't necessarily better . 
  actually , less can be better : you do n't need more money , more power , more children , more land to live a fulfilling life . 
  in the end , the first group is going to grow and win and dominate or destroy the second group . 
  sorry but i do n't get it . 
  even stockholm is a relatively small city in comparison to many other cities in europe . 
  london or paris are huge in comparison , therefore a growing population is problematic there . 
  why is n't it possible for the public and the private sector to build more housing in stockholm or in other cities ? 
  your system is great , but it needs to have an automatic adjustment between the amount of money given through pensions , and the amount of money taken in through taxes . 
  otherwise , you 'll end up with the current situation when there will be less workers and more retirees , or even worse less income because of a crisis : as reducing pensions is extremely unpopular even if less money has been raised , therefore the politicians do n't want to reduce the pensions , and prefer that the fund goes into debt to fill the gap , or push back the age of retirement . 
  you can have a nanny/caring grandparents/creche and caring parents at the same time . 
  also , [ school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kindergarten#france ) can start as early as 2 or 3 years old . 
  two parents working full-time in a demanding job can be tricky , but if one of the parents can work slightly less , around 60 or 80 % of a full-time during a few years , then you have a system which allows both parents to have a fulfilling job and a family life at the same time . 
   1500 / month would be nice it would be around the same wages as millions of people in western europe . 
  it 's just below the median wage in france ( 1770 $ per month after taxes ) where we have 10 % unemployment , and above the median wage in italy which has a 12 % unemployment rate . 
  the problem is : would you die for estonia or latvia if russia was invading them ? 
  personally , i have nothing against eastern europeans , but they are still too foreign for me . 
  i could probably fight for france , and am european enough to do so even for italy/spain/germany / belgium ... 
  i ca n't say the same thing , about eastern europe . 
  almost certainly , a dane could fight for sweden . 
  i do n't think that a dane would fight for greece though . 
  as you said , the model of the uk could be a good way to think about a european identity . 
  still , it 's far from being perfect . 
  just look at the tensions between scotland and england during the current , peaceful times in a prosperous country which shares the same language . 
  at the same time , you 'll see that the uk are already facing a complex situation with only a few nations , one of them overwhelming the others ( like the hans in china ) . 
  europe is much more complex and diverse , and there is n't an overwhelming nation . 
  even germany only represents 15 % of the european population . 
  therefore , a european nation would need a new model . 
  a kind of civic nationalism maybe ? 
  also , currently , only a few countries in europe could accept such european nationalism . 
  a eu team in the olympics would be a nice way to shape such nationalism . 
  also , think about how ridiculous a eu football team would be . 
  french newspaper * le monde * made [ an article ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2015/10/07/ou-sont-nes-les-prix-nobel-depuis-1901_4784330_4355770.html ) about the origins of nobel prize winners ( the article is in french , but there is an interactive map , and a chart in which europe is in blue ) . 
  germany is n't solely responsible of the current situation in the eu . 
  still , you are right about the `` sense of common or shared fate and identity '' . 
  in france for example , which is centralized , rich territories like paris and its region , or other rich cities , subsidize the poorest regions ; metropolitan france subsidize overseas territories etc. 
  and there is n't any criticism in this situation . 
  western germany also spent trillions to improve the situation in former eastern germany . 
  in belgium , hearing flemish people being upset because they subsidize the poorer walloons is quite common . 
  the reason is n't really the cost , but the fact that they are flemish first , not belgian . 
  in the eu , you hear how northern europe do n't want to pay for those lazy * pigs * which just proves that there is n't any real feeling of solidarity and sharing the same fate between europeans . 
  a kind of european foreign legion could be a good start . 
  having something like a tv channels you can watch [ euronews ] ( http://www.euronews.com ) , which is a great news outlet by the way . 
  you can do statistics about citizenship though . 
  in paris , 52 % of the rapists are n't french according to the [ ondrp ] ( http://www.inhesj.fr/fr/ondrp/les-publications/grand-angle/37 ) , which is a governmental institution . 
  the actual sentence for `` touching somebody 's buttocks '' would be way below this maximum sentence . 
  sexual assault includes every sexual offense that involves physically touching the victim , without penetration ( otherwise it 's rape , which is punishable by 15 years in prison ) .
