  the maximum punishment is high because it includes an act of forced masturbation for example . 
  if you start grinding against somebody , it 's not even sexual harassment anymore , it 's sexual abuse ( `` agression sexuelle '' , cf. 
  [ art . 
  222-27 code p\u00e9nal ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do?cidtexte=legitext000006070719&amp;idarticle=legiarti000006417688 ) ) , which is worse than sexual harassment . 
  sexual harassment through body language could be imitating a sexual act . 
   `` the imposition of any kind of words of behaviour that are intended to created a situation that is intimidating , humiliating , degrading , or offensive '' . 
  in france , [ sexual harassment ] ( https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichcodearticle.do?idarticle=legiarti000026268200&amp;cidtexte=legitext000006070719 ) is defined as `` the ** repeated imposition ** to a person of any kind of ** sexually connoted ** words or behaviour which impair the person 's dignity because of their degrading or humiliating nature , or create a situation that is intimidating , humiliating , degrading , or offensive '' . 
  `` is also considered as sexual harassment the fact , even unique , of using of any form of ** severe pressure ** aimed really or supposedly at obtaining a sexual act , for the author of the act or a third person . '', 
  therefore , their definition of `` gender harassment '' is lacking either the criteria of repetition , or the `` severe pressure '' , and the sexual connotation to be genuine sexual harassment . 
  of course !, 
  1 % of the population can feed the rest of us nowadays in ridiculously high quantity and diversity , instead of 90 % of the workforce needed to feed everyone . 
  such a change is better for everyone in the end , but is n't necessarily better for everyone at the very moment of its happening . 
  it can lead to unemployment and [ riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luddite ) . 
  if your company automates your job , it will be wealthier , but you wo n't . 
  exactly as when textile companies got wealthier when they outsourced their production in china : they got wealthier , but the european textile worker did n't . 
  i always thought that ireland was in the same boat as us about fertility rate . 
  the long term is relevant if the current welfare state is supported by debt . 
  the problem is that automation destroys jobs , thus people who used to be employed are unemployed . 
  then , maybe new jobs are created and filled by those unemployed people , and society as a whole is richer than before former jobs ' automation ( because you have the production of both old and new jobs ) . 
  also , this hypothesis only works if enough new jobs are created , which is n't necessarily certain in the future . 
  but , when people got unemployed , they got angry , which is bad for any politician . 
  an unemployed person is n't looking at the whole trend . 
  an unemployed person is only seeing that currently , because of automation , he got fired and has n't got a job anymore . 
   eu council-composed of eu heads of state the council of europe-ministers of your country this is the most `` undemocratic '' part of the eu . 
  strangely enough , most opponents to the eu do n't want less , but more of it , while complaining about the lack of democracy within the eu . 
  immigrants ' median income in france is 30 % lower than the french median income . 
  37 % of them live below the poverty line against 13,5 % for the whole population . 
  their descendants ' median income is 12 % lower than the french median income , and 20 % live below the poverty line . 
  the difference between the third generation and the average population is insignificant . 
  considering that [ 71 % ] ( http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/brief/roma ) of the roma people in eastern europe live in `` deep poverty '' , their situation is much worse . 
  even in france , north africans integrate much better than the roma . 
  yes , the worse situation for iran would be to be `` found '' hiding some yellowcake according to google earth . 
  actual wmds would be a good insurance against such findings . 
  if iran has nukes , an invasion is unlikely . 
   https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france/terrorism in your link , you 'll also find this : `` around 17 million british nationals visit france every year . 
  most visits are trouble-free . 
  the most common problem reported is pick-pocketing . '', 
  this is hardly a removal of safe countries . 
  you are right , the process is technically and morally difficult . 
  still , the process would be more manageable if asylum seekers are kept in refugee camps during the process , which could last months , where they would be sheltered , fed , healed if needed , and schooled for the children . 
  letting them live in european cities is much more expensive and not even more fulfilling for them , considering that they are n't allowed to work , which result in many of them wandering idle . 
  if they have to give their fingerprints during the process to a single administration also responsible for the asylum process , they would n't be able to change their identity and try to claim asylum several times . 
  if the decision is negative , they would n't be able to just disappear and stay as illegal immigrants hidden somewhere in the country , which result in burdening the country were they stay illegaly and reduces the country 's capacity and will to help those who really need help . 
  thus , it would be slightly better from the moral point of view . 
  also , it would be much better from the technical point of view . 
  * greece and italy would be more than happy to have the problem solved * france , spain and portugal do n't care that much because their main problem is about the state of the economy , so they wo n't oppose a tough policy on asylum seekers . 
  * the uk , denmark , nl , ireland , austria and even finland do n't want more migrants/refugees , or are at least afraid of a huge wave of refugees . 
  * belgium will do as the eu does as always * all of eastern europe wants to stop the migrants . 
  * even sweden is acknowledging that the burden is becoming unbearable . 
  the eu as a whole , and the public opinions are ready to follow a german lead to stop the migrants . 
  they are not ready to follow a german lead to welcome millions of migrants , for example through a quota system to share the burden . 
  the main problem is n't about controling the borders ( because what are you going to do anyway , sink the boat-people in the mediterranean sea ? 
  ) , it 's about letting the asylum seekers walking freely across the eu . 
  without incentives to come in , they wo n't risk their lives to come in . 
   as a matter of fact i have no clue what the current stance of the french leadership is on this exactly . 
  the french government is quiet , because the migrants are n't coming to france in huge numbers , therefore the country is n't bearing the crisis burden . 
  a part of the right wing opposition is advocating for the closing of the eu borders , but it 's not the main political issue here . 
  during last year , the government wanted to enforce the small quota system . 
  it 's hard to find a more recent stance . 
  hollande said a week ago that we have to reduce the stream of migrants in europe , but he is n't shouting it . 
  germany is the only country that matters here . 
  if germany decides to follow the finnish president 's words , the rest of europe will follow . 
  the process should take place at the borders and only at the borders . 
  if an asylum-seeker is found in the eu without asylum , then he has to be taken back to a sorting camp at the border . 
  if he is granted asylum during the process at the sorting camp , then he can come in . 
  the us and some european countries ( uk and france notably ) could stop to mess up the world and the me especially , but it wo n't be enough to bring peace . 
  we ca n't fix the world . 
  how are you going to prevent any civil war in any african country or in the me ? 
  syria is just a relatively small country . 
  the situation will be much worse if egypt , algeria or nigeria descend into chaos . 
  furthermore , we are not even talking about the fact that in 2050 , the african population will be twice higher ( 2.4 billion ) and global warming could have a devastating effect on overpopulated countries . 
  the eu needs a crisis-proof system , which could deal with a huge chaos in a neighbouring region resulting in tens of millions of people seeking to go to europe , while providing help to those who need it the most . 
  also , a significant part of those who come currently are n't directly affected by the war in syria , for example those who come from the maghreb . 
  the peace in syria wo n't stop them . 
  there are several threshold effect depending on the size of the company because of poorly thought laws , which are hard to change as labour is a sensible issue . 
  50 employees is one of those thresholds with 10 , 20 , 250 , 500 etc. 
  and probably the most important one . 
  in 2006 , our national statistics agency [ studied those thresold effects ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=iana2 ) especially in comparison to germany . 
  they found that the impact was real , but marginal ( [ around 0,2 % to 0,4 % ] ( http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/iana/iana2/img/graphique2.gif ) ) . 
  you are right , but a real european state centralised enough to have its own power and its own military is n't going to happen anytime soon , if ever . 
  the us are also heavily looking toward the pacific . 
   only about 18 % of the german defense budget are spent on research there is also a part of the research spending and production which is payed via the export arms industry . 
   i do n't understand why we ca n't centralise our militaries . 
  a country 's ability to use its army is the most important part of its sovereignty . 
  it has to be controled swiftly and unilaterally , at least at first , by the head of the state . 
  the way the eu works is slow and based around discussions , which is totally opposed to what an army need . 
  an eu army would never be projected . 
  look for example at the war in iraq for the uk , which was opposed by germany , france and belgium . 
  in such situation , the eu army would n't be able to intervene . 
  in the same way , the uk had the falklands war , and france is able to intervene quickly in africa , which would n't be possible for an eu army because any european country could be against this because of human rights or taxpayers concerns or any other reason . 
  you are british , therefore it 's not true that the us subsidises your safety . 
  currently , the only countries that have their safety subsidised by the shadow of the us are eastern european countries , which are hardly `` so rich '' . 
  france is pretty similar to germany in terms of infrastructures , standards of living , education of its population etc. . . 
  but there are a few differences which led to the poor french performance : * germany focused its industry in the long term on premium products , whereas france , like italy , focused its production on mid-range products . 
  the difference is obvious about car-makers for example . 
  mid-range products suffered more of the chinese competition . 
  ( also , notice how luxury products in france and italy , at the top of the quality spectrum , are successful . ), 
  * france 's economy is organised around big corporations that have an asymetrical relationship with small and medium-sized enterprises , which are basically submitted to them as those big corporations are their only client . 
  therefore , the small enterprises are heavily stessed . 
  in germany , there are also big corporations , but the relationship seem to be less unequal through an organisation of clusters .
