  your smes are often exporting in niche markets , whereas ours only work for our big corporations . 
  * big corporations usually do n't need unqualified workers , which leads to more unemployment as those corporations are more important in the french economy . 
  * the labour market is more rigid in france . 
  the minimum wage is 9,67 $ per hour . 
  in germany , the minimum wage is recent , and reaches 8,50 $ per hour . 
  overall , like belgium , france killed a significant chunk of its low paying jobs . 
  look at how well french productivity is [ ranked in comparison to countries ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/industry-and-services/oecd-compendium-of-productivity-indicators-2015/labour-productivity-2013_pdtvy-2015-graph7-en#page1 ) that have higher gdp per capita . 
   yeah , i think western europe and scandinavia you are right about the feeling of trust in scandinavia , and it 's a common clich\u00e9 about swedes especially . 
  it 's not that true about whole of western europe though , especially not in italy , france , belgium or spain , but the approach of roma people here was still the same at first . 
  the reason is that we saw the roma people living in awful conditions in some eastern european countries , without integrating in the general population . 
  the reflex in such situations is to think that the majority is excluding the minority , not that the minority is excluding itself . 
  the point of view in western europe changed swiftly though . 
   want you to sign a form for a fake association , in the end they just want money . 
  it 's also a tactic to draw the victim 's attention while stealing a phone or a wallet . 
  it is quite common in french cities like paris or lyon : toddlers sleeping with their mom begging , or young children begging themselves , and often teenagers begging or pickpocketing . 
  special schools ( including french as a foreign language ) are provided to them for free , but many kids only attend them 1 or 2 hours a day , because they have * work * to do . 
   problem being that customary law , as you put it , requires all relevant parties to accept it . 
  there is no difference in terms of consequences of the international law between a treaty and an international customary law here . 
  if a state does n't want to follow a treaty which it signed , it 's also unenforceable . 
  customary law still exists and is used as a source for international law , because it does n't need explicit consent of the states which are using it in order to be held as a legal norm . 
  there are litigations that are n't covered by a treaty , but still need a legal solution . 
  usually , if a state opposes to a customary law , then it is n't bounding anymore ( but this is also true for a treaty ) unless if it is against a peremptory norm , and even it that case , that wo n't be enforceable most of the time ( but this is also true for a treaty ) . 
  your criticism is justified , but is aimed against any kind of international law , including codified international law , not just customary law . 
   claim of customary law accepting gay marriage is common among gay rights activists . 
  customary law is about usage . 
  more specifically , it is about current usage . 
  there is n't currently ( and since centuries ) any usage of homosexual acceptance in africa . 
  therefore , claiming that a thousand years ago , hosomexuality was accepted , is an historical argument , not a legal argument . 
  you can say that there is a custom of tauromachia in spain , but you ca n't say that there is a custom of gladiator fighting in italy . 
  on a strictly legal point of view , there is currently , and since a long time , a customary rejection of homosexuality in africa and notably in uganda . 
  it does n't mean that it 's fair or that it should remain unchallenged , but it 's a fact . 
  still , that is hardly relevant because modern criminal laws usually do n't acknowledge customs as legal norms . 
  trade laws and international laws do . 
  i 'm not using the common language definition in a confusing way , unless goldsmith and posner , as any legal commentators are also using a `` wishy washy common language definition '' . 
  the decision of the north sea continental shelf was that the he use of the equidistance method had not crystallised into customary law , contrary to what netherland and denmark claimed , therefore this method was n't binding . 
  the decision also recognized that the use of customary law was legitimate , and explained more precisely the two needed criteria to find the existence of such a law : the practice and * opinio juris * of states . 
  you are the one confusing ** natural law ** and ** customary law ** , which is obvious when you talked about the example of the gay marriage . 
  nobody would claim that there is a customary law acknowledging gay marriage anywhere in the world . 
  natural law is n't used by courts and is unenforceable . 
  it 's just a philosophical and political claim that there are unwritten laws which are above the laws of the land . 
  the prime example is sophocles ' antigone . 
  customary law on the other hand , is actually used by national courts , international courts and arbitral tribunals . 
   the only sources that would claim international law to not be codified are typically propagandist sources the article 38 of the [ statute of the international court of justice ] ( http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0&amp;lang=en#chapter_ii ) states : `` 1 . 
  the court , whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it , shall apply : a. international conventions , whether general or particular , establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states ; b. 
  ** international custom , as evidence of a general practice accepted as law ** ; c. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations ; [ ... ] '' the cij used and precised the concept of customary international law in the famous * north sea continental shelf * cases between germany , denmark and the netherlands . 
  this is hardly a `` propagandist source '' . 
  to quote goldsmith and posner ( professors of law , university of chicago ) in * a theory of customary international law * :  customary international law ( `` cil '' ) is one of two primary forms of international law , the other being the treaty . 
  cil is typically defined as a `` customary practice of states followed from a sense of legal obligation . '' conventional wisdom views cil as a unitary phenomenon that pervades international law and international relations . 
  governments take care to comply with cil , and often incorporate its norms into domestic statutes . 
  national courts apply cil as a rule of decision , or a defense , or a canon of statutory construction . 
  nations argue about whether certain acts violate cil . 
  violations of cil are grounds for war or an international claim . 
  legal commentators view cil to be at the core of the study of international law . 
   there are no such rules . 
  customary international law exists and is useful , albeit being a set of `` unwritten rules '' . 
  damn it !, 
  italy , germany and the uk got masterpieces , and imdb prefers a film made by our own [ michael bay ] ( http://img.20mn.fr/azhmknrqswghbxqlzwrrug/648x415_luc-besson-a-moscou-9-septembre-2014.jpg ) for france ... 
   symbolism only helps the terrorists . 
  symbolism also helps to get votes of uninformed citizens , who make up for a significant part of the electorate . 
   i think that this is just an attempt by an ineffective government to `` look tough '' in order to avoid losing votes to the right , just like extending the state of emergency . 
  but beyond looking tough this measure is not just useless but harmful . 
  exactly . 
  also more specifically , the government needs the vote of the right mps and senators to change the constitution , what hollande promised . 
   much easier to punish them if they are french citizens . 
  you can punish them as well if they are n't french citizens . 
  the only difference in the procedural matter would appear if there is a terrorist making an act of terror in a foreign country , and if this country that has been victim of this act do n't prosecute him , which is extremely unlikely . 
  according to this hypothesis , if the terrorist is french , then france can prosecute him , but ca n't if he 's not . 
   also , would n't it do precisely nothing in terms of being able to prosecute terrorist suspects ? 
  yes , it would be useless and even the prime minister said so . 
  we are talking about people who are keen to blow themselves in the name of a religious fallacy . 
  therefore , losing the french citizenship is n't a threat for them at all . 
  furthermore , even if you catch for example a french-moroccan terrorist and removes his french citizenship , morocco still wo n't accept him and france still has to keep him in jail or under watch in france . 
  the prime minister also said that it was `` an important symbol '' , even if it 's contrary to the current constitution , and the right agrees with him ... 
  the greeks spend less now than before on their military , but it 's still around 2.4 % of their gdp , mainly because they fear turkey . 
  also , this is a big market for germany and france , therefore the eu did n't push too hard on reducing their military spending . 
  your article is about edf , which is a company where workers work less than the rest of the french private sector because it used to be a public monopoly ( and is almost still one ) , then proceed to compare the stats to the average us worker . 
  it 's like using google or goldman sachs as an example about how much you can earn in the us , then proceed to compare that specific example to the average earning of a german worker . 
  on average and including the rtt-days , french workers have 6 weeks of holidays , not 10 . 
  those are the actual non-worked days , not the legal requirement . 
  german workers have [ usually ] ( http://businessculture.org/western-europe/business-culture-in-germany/work-life-balance-in-germany/ ) 6 weeks of holidays according to most collective wage agreements . 
  every european country is way above the us in terms of holidays , but france is n't alone in that situation . 
   in that case the change in law is just a cosmetic pseudo action . 
  to some extent yes , but there are areas where people are actually working 35 hours a week : many office employees , employees in hospitals ( not the doctors ) , local government employees , some workers in protected industries ... 
  which means that the question of the 35 hours is seen as a highly controvertial subject here . 
   can someone explain how this is going to help that ? 
  the idea is that if french workers work more hours , the french workforce becomes more competitive , which means that the french economy becomes more competitive , thus leading to growth in france and producing wealth , because employment and wealth is n't a cake that you have to share . 
   the spike in unemployment in france ( 10 % i believe it was ) there is n't exactly a spike in unemployment in france . 
  there is a structural trend of slowly but surely growing unemployment in france since years , especially in the industry . 
  more precisely , there are a few cities that are moderately thriving ( paris , lyon , toulouse , nantes , the territories near geneva and to a lesser extent lille , montpellier , bordeaux , marseille ) , whereas the rest of the country is facing great economic difficulties ( deep industrial crisis , soaring unemployment ... ) . 
  the crisis there is limited by the huge public sector . 
  those areas are not competitive , but increasing the number of worked hours is n't going to solve the problem . 
  if the language of the movie is the same as the context depicted in the movie , then the original version is usually better than the dubbed version , because it feels more real ( ie : * the wire * or * das leben der anderen * have to be seen in their original version ) . 
  spielberg did a great job in * bridge of spies * by making the german policemen speak in german , without any subtitles by the way , instead of the overused bad german accent in english . 
  but for cartoons , anime , sci-fi or heroic-fantasy movies , or historical movies that do n't take place in the same language than the original version , then the dubbed version is much more immersive . 
  watching [ napoleon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewss4v2ql-a ) yelling in english looks more like chaplin 's dictator 's speech than a french emperor ... 
  this policy is even endorsed and pushed by the government of israel . 
  during the 18th century , half of france did n't even speak french . 
  even the legal and political system was n't unified between the provinces . 
  the revolution itself was violent , the country was attacked and surrounded by foreign powers and attacked from the inside by the counter-revolution of the chouannerie , while fighting against the catholic church . 
  most of the population remained royalist until 1875 ( which can be considered as the end of the revolutionary era ) , and french language and culture was forced upon the population until the beginning of the 20th century .
