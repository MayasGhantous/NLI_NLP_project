here you are : [ fran\u00e7oise hardy - tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvj42s-dkwk ) . 
  are you sure it 's not a legend ? 
  i heard a similar one about i do n't remember which french minister . 
  i used several books ( mostly * colloquial slovak * and * slovak for you * ) , as well as http://slovake.eu . 
  they are definitely closer , though . 
  as a foreigner learning slovak , i can mostly understand what 's going on when i read something in czech , but in croatian i do n't understand more than a few words . 
   czech with polish grammar i thought it was more like polish with a german accent . 
  i guess the names written in moldova are actually in [ gagauz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauz_language ) . 
  on the atlantic coast of france : uk , belgium , germany and netherlands . 
  since france is a big place with a lot of things to see , i 'll only talk about [ charente-maritime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charente-maritime ) , a place where i 've spent a lot of time because part of my family lives there . 
  it 's a department ( \u2248 district ) situated on the atlantic coast , with many [ beaches ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:c%c3%b4te_sauvage,_presqu%27%c3%aele_d%27arvert.jpg ) and german and dutch tourists during the summer . 
  * the biggest town is [ la rochelle ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:060905_overlooking_old_town_and_harbour.jpg ) , known for its [ old port ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:la_rochelle_vieux-port.jpg ) and its [ aquarium ] ( http://www.viree-malin.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/requins-aquarium-la-rochelle.jpg ) . 
  * right next to la rochelle there 's the [ r\u00e9 island ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:ile-de-re_vue_du_ciel.jpg ) , with [ ruins ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:iledere-abbaye.jpg ) , [ old fortified towns ] ( http://fr.questmachine.org/image:ile_de_re11296044800.jpg ) and [ salt evaporation ponds ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:maraissalant.jpg ) . 
  it 's also great for [ cycling ] ( http://www.iledere-infos.fr/carte-des-pistes-cyclables-de-l-ile-de-re-12-40-76.html ) . 
  * there is another island called [ ol\u00e9ron ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:%c3%8ele_d%27ol%c3%a9ron_aerial_view.jpg ) , a little less expensive and touristy than r\u00e9 , but it also has [ nice towns ] ( http://www.ot-chateau-oleron.fr/files/2013/11/le-chateau-thierry.jpg ) , [ beaches ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:plage_de_gatseau.jpg ) and a big pine forest . 
  * the tiny [ aix island ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/fichier:pixaile3.jpg ) is beautiful and cars are banned there . 
  [ this kind of house ] ( http://www.panoramio.com/photo/58120260 ) ( low , with white walls , an orange roof , colored shutters and these flowers ) is typical for the region . 
  * rochefort is another interesting town with a lot of historical buildings , such as one of the last [ transporter bridges ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochefort-martrou_transporter_bridge ) in the world and a [ long building ] ( http://www.lelogisdelahuppe.com/medias/images/php3yxwcs.jpg ) where they used to make ropes for ships . 
  * [ saintes ] ( http://www.saintes-tourisme.fr/img/jpg/image_7.jpg ) is also nice because it has roman monuments , notably an [ amphitheater ] ( http://www.cabinet-dromer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/saintes_amphitheatre.jpg ) and [ an arch ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:arc_de_germanicus.jpg ) . 
  * other nice towns and villages include [ royan ] ( http://www.camping-walmone.fr/v2/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/royan.jpg ) ( a seaside resort ) , [ marennes ] ( http://images.fotocommunity.fr/photos/paysages/mers-et-oceans/marennes-charente-maritime-f049ee0b-031f-43af-ad16-36fc70e9fd24.jpg ) ( famous for its oysters , together with ol\u00e9ron ) , [ brouage ] ( http://maurtimer.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/brouage9c.jpg ) ( a fortified town ) , [ talmont-sur-gironde ] ( http://forum.sfr.fr/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/48428ifb33c9469e43c8ff/image-size/original ) ( a pretty village with a [ beautiful church ] ( http://www.laboutiquederoyan.com/media/talmont_hauteurpcmm90__043128000_1657_11072014.jpg ) ) , etc. 
  * there are interesting buildings in the whole department such as [ fort boyard ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:fort_boyard_-_ao\u00fbt_2014.jpg ) , lighthouses ( [ la coubre ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:phare_de_la_coubre.jpg ) , [ chassiron ] ( http://www.oleron-hotel.fr/usermedia/photo-635125543650673114-2.jpg ) ... ) , [ german stuff ] ( http://www.ccalonnec.fr/sites/default/files/photo/brilliant_gallery_temp/bg_cached_resized_e7ff7c8f92fdcf922465356d8617e256.jpg ) from wwii , and of course a lot of churches everywhere . 
  * because the department is on the seaside , it is known for its seafood , mostly [ oysters ] ( http://maurtimer.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/marennes-olc3a9ron.jpg ) and mussels . 
  i do n't like oysters , but i love [ * \u00e9clade * or * \u00e9glade * ] ( http://static.canalblog.com/storagev1/pagure.canalblog.com/images/img_1608.jpg ) , a local recipe of mussels cooked under [ burning pine needles ] ( http://clubinfoal.pagesperso-orange.fr/images/eclade02.jpg ) , and then you eat them with bread and salt butter . 
  i 'm sure there are other interesting places in the department , but these are the ones i have visited personally . 
  there 's an [ association of french towns with a funny name ] ( http://www.commune-burlesque.com/ ) , although most of them are not funny . 
  the most famous one is probably [ montcuq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montcuq ) , which almost sounds like `` my ass '' . 
  apparently most routes are still planned or in construction , but as far as i know the french stretch of eurovelo 1 is completed . 
  i used it last summer , it 's very good , only cycle paths or quiet roads and the signing was good so i barely needed a map . 
  ah , this `` syndrome '' that affects 12 people among i do n't even know how many million tourists ... 
  also , the number of french people who look [ like this ] ( http://www.theexpathub.com/assets/images/2013/04/french_stereotype-450x225.jpg ) is probably zero . 
   slovaks can and do learn to speak czech indistinguishable from native really ? 
  i know slovaks have no trouble understanding czech , but i thought they still spoke slovak with czech people . 
  i 'm living in slovakia now , thanks to the european voluntary service . 
  french , esperanto , english . 
  and intermediate slovak and russian , and i 'm forgetting german because i hardly use it . 
  3 to 6 , depending on what you consider `` speaking a language '' . 
  if you want to go just for a few months or a year , you can try the [ european voluntary service ] ( http://europeanvoluntaryservice.org/ ) . 
  try [ this rock version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l1grj5cnuo ) too . 
   child beauty contests have been banned in france to stop `` hyper-sexualisation '' of young girls . 
  two years in prison for anyone who tries to organise a pageant . 
  reddit can be surprising . 
  afaik this is a non-issue in france , the only place where i heard about this is reddit . 
  the french word for smith is * forgeron * . 
  * febvre * must come from an older word ( in latin it 's * faber * ) . 
  i have n't heard about aliz\u00e9e for years in france , but she regularly comes up in foreign websites . 
  why ? 
  summary for people who do n't undestand slovak : * since midnight , there are police controls at the austrian and hungarian borders . 
  they do n't stop every car , they mostly check buses and trucks . 
  * 220 policemen have been sent , not only to border crossings but also to some towns and train stations . 
  * according to the information aktuality.sk received , no illegal migrant has been arrested since midnight . 
   so many french people i know consider it a global language that should be used instead of english . 
  i think a lot of french still live in a past era ( where it used to be more widely accepted on a global scale ) but ca n't seem to accept the present reality that english is the dominant international language . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  i do n't know a single person who thinks the world should speak french . 
  the only time in my life i heard a sentence along the lines of `` i wish french were the world language instead of english '' it came out of the mouth of a polish girl who spoke perfect french . 
  the french definitely `` accept the present reality that english is the dominant international language '' . 
  they are as obsessed with english as anyone else : people use english words because they think it sounds cool , ads are full of english words and all my life i 've been hearing that everybody should learn english . 
  living in another country and not even trying to learn the local language shows a lack of respect for the country and the culture , in my opinion . 
  i could live in slovakia without bothering to learn slovak ( and many expats do this -- last year i met an old american who had lived there for almost 20 years without knowing any slovak ) , although my life would be a little more complicated , but i 'm doing my best to learn slovak . 
  it 's the belgian version of a redneck , if i understand correctly . 
  afaik all slavic languages are like this . 
  in slovak , if i 'm not mistaken : * jeba\u0165 = to fuck * dojeba\u0165 = to break * rozjeba\u0165 = to smash * prejeba\u0165 = to lose * ujeba\u0165 = to steal * najeba\u0165 sa = to get drunk * zjeba\u0165 sa = to fall and that 's only the ones i know , there are many , many more . 
  could you translate it ? 
  i guess it has something to do with otters . 
  it 's common in france too . 
  i actually made some cr\u00eapes today for breakfast and ate them with jam . 
  i like this series . 
  now i 'm waiting for `` so you want to visit hungary '' with pictures of istria and transylavania and `` so you want to visit russia '' with pictures of crimea . 
  they have a beautiful language and i love pelmeni . 
  apart from the fact that the original vocabulary ( 900 roots ) has been expanded to more than 15,000 roots ( from which you can create a huge number of words ) in the most comprehensive dictionary , you can read about its evolution [ here ] ( http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/evolution.htm ) . 
  and what council are you talking about ? 
   it is a dead language  you are not even allowed to make new words i 'm sorry , but both of these assertions are wrong . 
  esperanto is a living language and like in every living language , its users create new words . 
  considering the shitstorm happening because of a guy who wrote in french , i ca n't even imagine what would happen with esperanto . 
   i just do n't want french to be elevated at the expense of other european languages you mean like what is happening with your language ? 
  i approve . 
  i do n't understand a word but i like seeing latvian . 
  [ attentat ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attentat ) is an english word , although it is outdated . 
  i 'm sure it 's an honest mistake from dclauzel , because many french words also exist in english . 
  i know russian people who found slovak * \u010derstv\u00e9 potraviny * ( fresh food ) especially funny . 
  * potraviny * does n't exist in russian but it reminded them of poisoning . 
  is this how breton is supposed to sound or does the guy just have a strong french accent ? 
  i mixed up icelandic and faroese and i had no idea what lower saxon and the frisian dialects were supposed to sound like . 
   science majors can afford to get a shitty grade i confirm , i got 5/20 in philosophy . 
   same in western part of slovakia . 
  is it ? 
  i 've been in slovakia for a year and a half and the standard greeting seems to be saying hello without any physical contact . 
  i have only one acquaintance who kisses me to say hello and a few friends i hug because i do n't meet them often . 
  where do you guys go to find squat toilets in france ? 
  the last time i saw squat toilets they were in shitty campgrounds . 
  does anyone know why the letter p is so popular in chinese and the letter g in german ? 
  no , i usually look up the french wikipedia first , although i often read the english one too . 
  in france there is an association called [ the most beautiful villages in france ] ( http://www.les-plus-beaux-villages-de-france.org ) . 
  i visited very few of them , but i liked [ talmont-sur-gironde ] ( https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=talmont%20sur%20gironde ) a lot . 
  * native : french * fluent : esperanto , english * intermediate : slovak , russian * i never had a very high level and i 'm forgetting more and more : german * i could probably manage to communicate in case of emergency : spanish , polish , italian, 
  has anyone here met creationists in real life ? 
  honestly , i heard about creationists almost only on american websites and i 'm not sure i 've ever heard the word `` creationism '' in real life . 
  many years ago i introduced my then-girlfriend to a czech friend and she kissed her . 
  the czech friend was very surprised . 
  it was a little awkward .
