  now i live in slovakia , i do n't have to waste time kissing or shaking hands with people i see everyday , it 's great . 
  i just hug people i rarely see and i 'm genuinely happy to see . 
  now i will probably find kissing weird when i come back to france . 
  oh god , this stupid map again . 
  i 've been drinking tap water in slovakia for a year without any problem , restaurants bring you tap water if you ask and i 've even heard radio ads about drinking tap water . 
  the weirdest town name i saw in slovakia is hlin\u00edk nad hronom ( aluminium on the hron ) . 
  it sounds pretty soviet . 
  yes , `` je te pisse \u00e0 la raie '' ( i piss to your ass crack ) is a common phrase to express contempt to someone . 
  i discovered [ crumbed mushrooms ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7zxwluwj5iu/teqboerq45i/aaaaaaaaeig/rk0tm067gv4/s1600/5555100_4633.jpg ) in slovakia . 
  it 's delicious , usually eaten with baked potatoes or fries and tatar sauce . 
  they crumb all kind of stuff here , including cauliflowers , broccoli and cheese . 
  i 've never needed to talk about this in english so i hope `` crumb '' is the right word . 
  it 's also interesting how many languages took the general french word for `` mushroom '' ( * champignon * ) to name common mushrooms , while in french they are called `` paris mushrooms '' . 
  i live in slovakia and a few weeks ago i spoke to an older czech woman ( not that old , maybe 50 ) . 
  at some point she said `` here in the czech republic '' . 
  interesting , it 's also the meaning of hungarian * h\u00fasv\u00e9t * . 
  last time i came back to france , just after christmas , i went through a shopping centre in paris with all my luggage . 
  one guard made me open my suitcase and then said `` it 's ok '' within one second , almost without seeing anything i had in it . 
  i really wondered what the point was . 
  that 's crazy , when i went to ukraine in 2011 , 1 euro was around 11 hryvnias , and now it 's more like 29 . 
  i like slavic languages . 
  russian probably is the most beautiful , followed by slovak and croatian . 
  czech sounds like a weird version of slovak to me . 
  finnish is beautiful too , and hungarian is not exactly beautiful but it sounds interesting . 
  italian sounds better than other romance languages ( i ca n't judge french because it 's my mother tongue ) . 
  among the germanic languages , swedish is my favourite . 
  and for some reason many languages are more beautiful when sung than when spoken ( such as german and polish ) . 
  on a related note , the indonesian word for water is * air * . 
   the first is that r\u0103zboi might derive from latin `` res bellum '' ( affair of war ) . 
  it does n't , [ it 's a slavic loanwoard ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/r%c4%83zboi ) . 
  i know quite a lot about slovakia because i 'm one of the rare crazy foreigners who live there . 
  i 'd love to visit slovenia though , i 've only been in ljubljana for a few days and the weather was awful . 
  why is there a tiny country in the middle of another country ? 
  what 's going on there ? 
   anywhere where roma does live i was pretty shocked when i visited zvolen . 
  i climbed the hill to pust\u00fd hrad , from there there 's a beautiful panorama , the city looks nice and clean , except for a small street where [ the buildings look like shit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gkqqx5q.jpg ) ( apparently the roof burnt and now there are plants growing in it ) . 
  and here 's [ google street view in lun\u00edk ix ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@48.6961045,21.2215846,3a,75y,209.2h,95.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgge0zzfs4ynj7t9ib_mhiq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  i do n't know about ukrainian and belorussian , but '' \u0441 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c '' definitely is the usual new year greeting in russian . 
  it 's the first time i hear about this . 
  same here , never had a problem in cdg . 
  the only thing i do n't like is that going to paris from there is expensive and the regional trains go through shitty suburbs . 
  yeah right , please tell me more about the separatist movement in normandy . 
  i 'm from france and i speak french , esperanto , english ; slovak and russian at an intermediate level , bad german , and in case of emergency i could probably express myself in polish or spanish . 
  jacques brel - [ ne me quitte pas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2wmkcbm4ik ) ( `` do n't leave me '' ) , one of his best songs . 
  renaud - [ manu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ficuj08ifmk ) , where he tries to comfort a friend whose girlfriend left . 
  [ \u042f \u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b \u0443 \u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykobjul-2ue ) , from the soviet romantic comedy * the irony of fate * ( and a [ nice interpretation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjyg5diauyq ) by alexander rybak ) . 
  [ szomor\u00fa vas\u00e1rnap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejpaohe6jv4 ) , nicknamed the '' [ hungarian suicide song ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gloomy_sunday ) '' ( and a [ metal version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uogfahvfhos ) ) . 
  it really depends on languages and countries . 
  slovak people say `` je\u017ei\u0161 '' ( jesus ) or `` bo\u017ee '' ( god ) very often , while in france pretty much nobody uses religious swear words ( all curses involving `` god '' i can think of sound really outdated ) . 
   the french academy the one 99 % of french people do n't care about ? 
  and what about coluche ? 
  czechs and slovaks call computers po\u010d\u00edta\u010d , hungarians call them sz\u00e1m\u00edt\u00f3g\u00e9p and finns call them tietokone . 
  i 'm not sure i understand your point . 
   also the french being over nationalistic , inventing french words for every commonly english known word ( e-mail  couriel , walkman  baladeur , ... ) does n't help . 
  it 's funny how only the french are called `` nationalistic '' when they do this ( even though most of the proposed neologisms never catch on ) . 
  icelanders are probably the biggest languages purists in the world , but they are not `` nationalistic '' . 
  itt : ordinary french bashing . 
  i 've never met anyone in france who thinks french is `` superior '' , that the whole world should speak french or that `` i hate le english hon hon baguette '' , but please keep on spouting stereotypes . 
  in slovakia many restaurants offer a lunch menu which includes a soup and a main course for 3-4 $ . 
  in france , the best known is probably [ henri d\u00e9sir\u00e9 landru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_d%c3%a9sir%c3%a9_landru ) . 
  he murdered 11 people ( 10 women plus the son of his first victim ) from 1915 to 1919 . 
  til yannick and cyrille can be female names . 
  i 've never heard of women with these names . 
  it will never be in any official capacity because eu forbids linguistic discrimination and officially supports multilingualism . 
  but thanks for the random french bashing . 
  they 're still part of russia . 
  russia has cool flags , such as [ chuvashia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/flag_of_chuvashia.svg/1280px-flag_of_chuvashia.svg.png ) , [ mordovia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/flag_of_mordovia.svg/1200px-flag_of_mordovia.svg.png ) , [ yamalo-nenets autonomous okrug ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/flag_of_yamal-nenets_autonomous_district.svg/1280px-flag_of_yamal-nenets_autonomous_district.svg.png ) and of course [ zheleznogorsk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/flag_of_zheleznogorsk.svg/1280px-flag_of_zheleznogorsk.svg.png ) . 
  in france , all regions apparently have [ flags nobody knows ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_des_drapeaux_des_r\u00e9gions_et_territoires_fran\u00e7ais ) ( with few exceptions such as brittany and corsica , which have well-known flags ) . 
  i like the one of [ midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/flag_of_midi-pyr%c3%a9n%c3%a9es.svg/1280px-flag_of_midi-pyr%c3%a9n%c3%a9es.svg.png ) , which is apparently the unofficial flag of occitania as well . 
  edit : zheleznogorsk is actually in asia . 
  i love them . 
  i learned russian and slovak . 
  i am conversational in both , but i 'm better at slovak . 
  they 're both beautiful languages . 
  declensions are n't that bad , i do n't really have problems with them ( except with less common words with weird declensions ) . 
  for me the real difficulty is verbs : the [ aspect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_aspect_in_slavic_languages ) is difficult to grasp if you do n't have it in your native language , and it does n't even work exactly the same way in slovak and russian . 
  and then you have all the prefixes , you can add almost any prefix to any verb and you get a verb that has a completely different meaning or that means almost the same but with a nuance i do n't get , which makes me feel like the vocabulary is infinite . 
  i also have some basic knowledge of polish and i 'd love to learn some slovenian or croatian , but i do n't plan soon and i would n't really have much use for them . 
  bulgarian and macedonian look interesting too , and belarusian sounds like weird russian . 
  it does , `` she '' is '' \u015di '' . 
  the chart is incomplete . 
   the world 's longest , nonstop domestic flight is paris to st. denis , r\u00e9union as well . 
  til , i expected moscow-vladivostok to be longer but map projections deceived me . 
   francuzsky kluc interestingly we call it `` cl\u00e9 anglaise '' ( english key ) in french . 
  to french  to prepare food by cutting it into strips . 
   to kiss ( another person ) while inserting one 's tongue into the other person 's mouth . 
  i 'm ok with this . 
  how do you know ? 
  do you speak it ? 
  this is incorrect . 
  esperanto literature has existed since it was created . 
  there 's a 740-page [ concise encyclopedia of the original literature of esperanto ] ( https://www.amazon.com/concise-encyclopedia-original-literature-esperanto/dp/1595690905/ref=cm_lmf_tit_2 ), 
  why ? 
  i speak it fluently , i can confirm it 's true . 
  the only places in france where i 've seen squat toilets in the last years are campgrounds . 
  camping in france seems to be popular among dutch tourists , maybe that 's where they see them . 
  i just look at [ official data ] ( http://statdat.statistics.sk/cognosext/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi?b_action=cognosviewer&amp;ui.action=run&amp;ui.object=storeid\\ ( % 22i0c852caa5451437c92774db33ec08675 % 22 \\ ) & ui.name = ve % c4 % bekostn % c3 % a9 % 20skupiny % 20obc % c3 % ad % 20 - % 20sr % 2c % 20oblasti % 2c % 20kraje % 2c % 20okresy % 2c % 20mesto % 2c % 20vidiek % 20 % 5bom7023rr % 5d & run.outputformat = & run.prompt = true & cv.header = false & ui.backurl = % 2fcognosext % 2fcps4 % 2fportlets % 2fcommon % 2fclose . html & run.outputlocale = sk ) and there are 993 municipalities in slovakia with 1,000 inhabitants or more . 
  i think the map shows only the [ 140 municipalities ] ( https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/zoznam_miest_na_slovensku ) that have the status of town . 
  occitan is still more spoken than several languages that appear on this map ( manx , faroese , sami ... ) . 
  not for most people in france .
