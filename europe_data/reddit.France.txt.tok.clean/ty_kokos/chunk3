   the distinction between ` bo ' and ` po ' is one that does n't exist in indo-european languages i am not sure about the languages of europe ( aspiration exists in english but it 's not phonemic ) , but e.g. 
  hindi has this distinction . 
  is the first line colloquial czech and the second line standard written czech ? 
  i 'm still not sure what is supposed to be funny about these languages comparison memes . 
  * russian : ryba * ukrainian : ryba * polish : ryba * czech : ryba * slovene : riba * croatian : riba * bulgarian : riba * english : fish wow english is so weird, 
  `` pouce '' means `` thumb '' in french .

  that shit has been debunked hundreds of times , who upvotes these comments ? 
  in addition to what other people said , / r/europe is in english , so it definitely is n't representative of many countries in europe . 
   some people tried to follow the american trend , but it has n't cought up same in france , it was quite popular 10-15 years ago , but now it looks like it mostly died out , except maybe as a theme for parties . 
  wait , i just saw [ the same thread in spanish ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/5o277h/helloim_collecting_photos_from_around_the_world/ ) in / r/france , what is going on ? 
  i 'd like to see more details , because i have no idea what the 4 french diphthongs are supposed to be . 
  probably / wa / and / w\u025b\u0303 / , and then what ? 
  same thing for the 17 vowels . 
  i 'm not sure what the 17th is supposed to be , and most people distinguish less . 
  esperanto has 23 consonants , i do n't know what this '' ( +4 ) '' means . 
  and it is often analysed as having 2 or even 0 diphthongs , not 6 . 
  i would also like to know what the 15 russian diphthongs are . 
  and why are long vowels counted as separate phonemes in several languages but not estonian ?

  i can definitely hear the accent of the woman in the first video . 
  is russian her native language , though ? 
  i 'm not really sure about the second video . 
   most other accents ( like in brittany , paris , lyon ) are actually very slight and you probably would n't notice them at all without being a native and living long enough near the place . 
  despite being french , i have no idea what a breton accent is supposed to sound like . 
   st. petersburg probably has almost `` no accent '' . 
  i like accents of arkhangel ` sk and nizhniy novgorod - they are `` soft '' and sound traditionally for my ears . 
  what is the difference between these accents ? 
  i speak intermediate russian and i 'm totally unable to hear accent differences among native speakers ( except for people who pronounce \u0433 as h ) . 
  no , the oppressive policy that regional languages were forbidden in schools and their speakers shamed for decades . 
  it 's about languages , not countries . 
  crimea is russian-speaking . 
  i never understood why people in other countries think the french are some linguistic chauvinists because it really does n't feel that way to me , but compared to people who are willing to commit language suicide in the name of progress , i guess we are extreme nationalists . 
  you 're kidding , but in italy i met a girl from hendaye who had to travel through paris to go home ...

  that might be true if being able to count to ten counts as `` speaking english '' .

  georgian is fascinating , unfortunately i would n't have much use for it . 
  i also know a guy from the french-speaking part of switzerland whose surname is allemand ( german ) . 
   french needs also a serious orthographic reform unfortunately it 's almost impossible , orthography is almost a religion in france . 
  last year the public discovered the 1990 spelling reform ( which introduces only minor changes ) and everyone was scandalized even though they barely knew what the reform was about . 
   was n't there a mini reform last year ? 
  it was actually adopted in 1990 , but for some reason the media discovered it last year . 
  the changes are minor and most people would n't notice it if they read a text in the reformed orthography . 
  i 've never heard this . 
  is it regional ? 
  i think there are two things to distinguish when you talk about `` esperanto '' : * esperanto , the language as it used now , * the idea of introducing the widespread use of esperanto for international communication ( e.g. 
  in the eu ) . 
  most people here seem to argue about the second one . 
  esperanto as a language is not really something you can argue for or against , it is just a fact : esperanto has been a living language for more than a century and it is used by people all around the world , sometimes daily , with friends , family , at work , etc. , regardless of whether esperanto will be someday widely adopted or not . 
  i think it 's a pretty amazing phenomenon : a language invented by one guy that turned into a real , living language that even has native speakers - i do n't know about any other case of something similar , and in my opinion it 's definitely worth learning as it is today . 
  the second point is a different matter . 
  i think the use of esperanto as a common eu language would make sense , because it is much easier to learn than natural languages and it is not the language of some countries , but i do n't think it 's going to happen , unfortunately . 
   the invariance of all words and the agglutination mechanisms to form new terms this is exactly how esperanto works . 
  all words are made by agglutinating invariable morphemes . 
  * arrosage * means * watering * . 
  yes , everyone uses * octet * for * byte * . 
  how does it `` dumb things down and eliminate the hundreds of years of culture behind real languages '' ? 
  no esperanto speaker wants to eliminate any language or culture . 
  this is incorrect . 
  esperanto is very much a living language . 
  there are people who use it in their daily life . 
  there 's also rose , violette ( violet ) , france , cerise ( cherry ) , constance ( constancy ) , marguerite ( daisy ) , marine , cl\u00e9mence ( clemency ) , cl\u00e9ment , d\u00e9sir\u00e9 ( desired ) , innocent , olivier ( olive tree ) , fortun\u00e9 ( fortunate ) . 
  cl\u00e9ment , cl\u00e9mence , olivier and marine are common names , the other are uncommon or old-fashioned . 
  we seem to have a lot of names in common with the italians , i remembered half of these thanks to the italian list somewhere in this thread . 
  unfortunately , this article is / r/badlinguistics material . 
  i do n't know what it is about sanskrit that attract pseudolinguists that much . 
   med is a croatian word meaning honey and this comes from the sanskrit madhu , a name for krsna . 
   vi\u0111en is a croatian word which means ` to see ' , originating from the sanskrit vid meaning ` to see ' or ` to know ' . 
  from this sanskrit vid we get the german wit which means ` to know ' , we also get the latin videre which means ` to see ' , and the word video which means ` to record ' . 
  basically the logic is `` the words are similar in sanskrit and other languages , therefore the words come from sanskrit '' , which is ridiculous . 
  ( how could slavic languages borrow so many words from sankrit ? 
  have they ever been in contact with sanskrit or other indian languages ? ), 
  these words are similar because they share a common indo-european origin that predates sanskrit . 
  it 's really interesting and cool to think that our languages are connected , but it does n't make sanskrit the source of modern languages all around the world . 
   the croatian word for home is dom , originating from sanskrit dam ( ` house ' ) . 
  we see this dom in english words such as domestic and kingdom meaning ` of the home ' and ` the home of the king ' this is even worse . 
  `` domestic '' is related to latin `` domus '' , which comes from the same indo-european words as the croatian and sanskrit words . 
  the '' - dom '' suffix in `` kingdom '' , however , [ is not related ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-dom#english ) .

  [ posthumous marriage is allowed in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posthumous_marriage#france ) . 
  it 's extremely rare , i 've heard about it for the first time on reddit . 
  according to article 171 of the civil code :  the president of the republic may , for serious reasons , authorize the celebration of the marriage if one of the future spouses is dead providing a sufficient gathering of facts establishes unequivocally his consent . 
  in this case , the effects of the marriage date back to the day preceding that of the death of the spouse . 
  however , this marriage does not carry with it any right of intestate succession to the benefit of the suviving spouse and no matrimonial regime is considered to have existed between the spouses, 
  everyone in slovakia undestands czech . 
  but for me it 's annoying , i learned slovak but i understand half of what czech people say . 
  by the way , does rhubab jam exist in slovakia ? 
  i love it but i could n't find it ( but i did n't look very hard ) .

  there 's also a place d'islande in strasbourg , is n't it ? 
  in french it 's not confusing , you use a different preposition ( as you do in english ) : * in europe : en europe * on europe : sur europe in most cases , the continent also has an article : * europe is ... : l'europe est. . . * europa is ... : europe est. . . not to mention that 99 % of the time , you 're not talking about a jupiter moon .
