  in slovakia : the tap water is very good , i 've never bought bottled water . 
  to me portuguese sounds like the polish of romance languages . 
  are these forms actually used ? 
  slovak has this too , * chodieva\u0165 * is a normal word but i do n't think i 've ever heard * chodievava\u0165 * or something like that . 
   here , you ca n't distinguish `` p\u00e8re '' from `` pair '' orally are these words pronounced differently by anyone ? 
   french is also one language where places names and sometimes even people 's names are translated . 
  you mean like pretty much every other language ? 
   there really is a huge difference for us . 
  i pronounce all of the words you mentioned identically . 
  i know some people make a distinction between future and conditional in the first person singular ( je travaillerai/je travaillerais ) , but it 's the first time i hear about - ais , - ait and - aient being pronounced differently . 
  how do you pronounce them ? 
  all these weird vowels . 
  whenever i hear a recording of me speaking english , i 'm like `` wtf , do i really have such a strong french accent ? '', 
  even russian gives me less trouble . 
  it just sounds normal to me . 
  to find border disputes you have to look at oversea territories , e.g. 
  [ matthew and hunter islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthew_and_hunter_islands ) that are claimed by vanuatu . 
  yes , why ? 
  is it ? 
  in french they are called * \u00eeles malouines * without political connotations . 
  not if i have a choice . 
  my computer is in french . 
  sometimes i set things to a language i 'm learning . 
  my phone and facebook interface are in slovak , before that they used to be in russian . 
  now that you mention it , i wonder if slovak * tehla * ( brick ) has the same origin ( * g * turned into * h * a few centuries ago ) . 
   native means that people grew up speaking it , not learning it from grammar books . 
  this is exactly what i mean . 
   those people are n't native speakers . 
  they are . 
  they learned esperanto as children from their parents . 
  they never studied grammar and vocabulary lists . 
   nobody ever spoke it as a native [ this is incorrect . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzds2wyembi ) you 're speaking like nobody had ever tried to speak esperanto , but it 's been a living language for more than a century . 
  [ i made a chart . 
  i 've never eaten frog . 
  i 've never seen frogs in restaurant menus or supermarkets . 
  i 've never heard anyone saying `` we had frogs for dinner yesterday '' . 
  why the hell does everyone think we eat frogs ? 
  one is a pronoun , the other one is a noun and often preceded by an article . 
  i can not think of a sentence that would be ambiguous . 
  upvote for bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica , it 's the most beautiful town i 've visited in slovakia . 
  are you sure it 's not kremnica on the third picture ? 
  we have dinner with family and stuff ourselves with a lot of food . 
  some families open their presents on the 24th , other on the 25th ( it 's tomorrow for me ) . 
  there is [ a poll about this on / r/france ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/5k29kf/ouvrir_les_cadeaux_de_no%c3%abl_au_r%c3%a9veillon_ou_le_25/ ) now . 
  see also [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ww92ockh0g ) . 
  native : french . 
  fluent : english , esperanto . 
  okay : slovak , russian . 
  ( i can have normal conversations , watch tv or read books if they 're not too difficult , etc. ), 
  i studied it for like 10 years for a shitty result : german . 
  i kinda understand and know basics of a few more languages . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-vwbv6tjxu ) whenever i go back to france i 'm like `` wtf , people i barely know are kissing me '' . 
  does georgia count ? 
  if not , italy or croatia . 
  i 've seen beautiful places in slovakia too . 
  two years ago i went to denmark . 
  while waiting for my flight , i listened to a group of people talking next to me . 
  i thought `` hey , danish does n't sound that bad . '', 
  then i saw their passports . 
  they were swedes . 
  i have no idea what you 're trying to say . 
  in writing i can recognise all national languages of european countries ( i 'm just not sure i could n't tell apart danish and norwegian ) . 
  when spoken , i can recognise easily french , english , german , italian , spanish , russian , czech , slovak , polish , hungarian , finnish . 
  i would need to listen more attentively , but i think i could guess portuguese , romanian , greek , ukrainan , belarussian , estonian , dutch , danish , swedish , icelandic , turkish , catalan . 
  however i 'd probably mistake norwegian for swedish , lithuanian for latvian or the other way around , and i 'm not sure i would recognise albanian . 
  south slavic languages are difficult too , i may tell apart slovene from bulgarian , but i 'd probably mix the rest up . 
  that 's excluding most minority languages and non-standard regional accents . 
  last month i accidentally mistook swiss german for dutch . 
  :( also , since nobody linked it yet : http://greatlanguagegame.com/, 
  all these threads about ratatouille on / r/france made me want to cook some , though . 
  honestly i 'm convinced that redditors care about the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise more than the french do . 
  probably [ adyghe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adyghe_language ) or some caucasian language . 
  just thinking about its pronunciation makes my throat hurt . 
  the thing with berets , striped shirts , red scarves , weird moustaches or , even weirder , onion/garlic rings around the neck . 
  i can guarantee you there are exactly 0 people who look like that in france . 
  reddit taught me [ where it comes from ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onion_johnny ) , though . 
  i 'm sure very few french people have heard of this . 
  what about * frajer ( ka ) * ? 
  thanks to the recent fusion of regions , i 've been to all mainland french regions except provence-alpes-c\u00f4te-d'azur . 
  i have n't been to corsica or any oversea territory . 
  i 've been to all regions of slovakia though . 
  ] ( http://www.academie-francaise.fr/apres-que ) it sounds weird to me too . 
  i spent most of my life near paris . 
  that depends on where you 're from . 
  for me they are identical . 
   even the present form is often not used in spoken language huh ? 
  it is definitely used . 
  people even use the subjunctive after * apr\u00e8s que * , which should be followed by the indicative according to grammar nazis . 
  same here , most comics i read were from either belgium or france ( maybe more from belgium , i am not sure ) . 
  i really like andr\u00e9 franquin 's work . 
  so patronymics are not mandatory if a child is born from parents whose culture do n't have patronymics ? 
  and in formal situations where you refer to people as given name + patronymic , what do you do with foreigners who do n't have a patronymic ? 
  when i was in russian people simply used my given name but i was n't in any formal situation . 
  i know a russian guy who married a polish woman in poland . 
  she took his name as it is written in his passport , so with an english , un-polish spelling ( including * kh * ) and now she has a surname ending in * - ov * . 
  it would probably be similar in france , but i thought poland would have allowed * - ova * because some polish surnames vary depending on the gender . 
  * literally nobody in france looks like the stereotype of the guy with a moustache wearing a beret and a striped shirt . 
  * i have no idea who eats frogs in france . 
  i do n't .
