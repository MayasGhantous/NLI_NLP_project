  the weather is best around the mediterranean . 
  i 'd definitely recommend you settle in a big city , so that you can immerse culturally as much as possible . 
  southern france is nice with places such as marseilles and nice along the sea . 
  italy is awesome too , for example naples which has a unique southern european atmosphere . 
  switzerland ( geneva ) is nice too and french , german and italian are all spoken here . 
  i just do n't understand how this can happen . 
  it 's not the only occurrence either , on every piece of legislation meps will push amendments in the sole interest of the lobbys . 
  but why ? 
  what are they gaining from it ? 
  is it really bribes ? 
  is n't it illegal ? 
  it 's just mind blowing . 
  is n't it the opposite ? 
  i thought common law was evolving based on context and largely jurisprudential . 
  i was not talking about competitiveness , but about the fact that the economy runs on energy . 
  i thought only god could `` retire '' a pope ? 
  anyways probably a good thing , he was a step backwards comparing with his predecessor . 
  price parity of wind with with coal and natural gas ? 
  they got it all backwards , price is not the question . 
  we ** need ** energy to build cars and machines , to make fertilizer , fuel tractors and bring food to the huge cities we have built , to commute , to operate hospitals , to survive in winter , etc. 
  that need wo n't change if 1 kwh costs 1 cent or 1 thousand euros . 
  so , since we wo n't be getting any more fossil fuels than we already get , and probably less and less , we do n't have many choices : 1 . 
  cover europe with forests , photovoltaic cells and wind generators . 
  i do n't think it is actually possible as it would require too much area and raw materials . 
  start wwiii and get fossil energy where it is . 
  it would still only be postponing the problem . 
  nuclear counts as fossil in my opinion since it is not renewable . 
  invent nuclear fission . 
  learn to live with less energy . 
  that 's really the only thing we can do . 
  time to be realistic . 
  prices in almost all restaurants in france include 15 % for service , so additional tipping is not needed . 
  many people still tip .5 to 2 $ if the service was good , but it seems from personal anecdotal evidence that the practice declines . 
  the article of the european convention on human rights referenced in the ruling :  ** article 10 **  ** freedom of expression **  1 . 
  everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting , television or cinema enterprises . 
  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  no surprise that france is behind this . 
  `` commissions '' made of a majority of lobbyists are our specialty . 
   they would be contributing about the same with or without the subsidies . 
  without the subsidies each country 's contribution would be about 30 % lower ( except the uk ) . 
  take a look at [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17ca02/52_of_french_in_favour_of_uk_exit_from_the_eu/c84bi1d ) i made earlier , which is factual . 
  i 'm not disputing the fact that france receives the biggest cap subsidies , but considering we have the biggest agricultural land area of all eu countries , that 's only logical . 
  you still have n't explained where we said other countries should n't receive subsidies . 
   you 'll note that france is noticeably less excited about subsidizing the agricultural production of other countries . 
  really ? 
  can you provide a quote or did you just make that up ? 
  france supports the cap but the cap applies to all countries in the eu . 
  the [ tour montparnasse ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/meteorry/7172016765/ ) . 
  in itself it is a rather ugly but not unusual looking office building , however it stands as a sore thumb in the middle of paris . 
  it became illegal to build any new building higher than 7 stories 3 years after its construction . 
  the architect jean nouvel has a project to make the tower even uglier by fitting it with a [ piece of scrap metal ] ( http://www.linternaute.com/actualite/grand-projet/photo/grand-paris-voici-ce-qu-ont-prevu-les-architectes/un-chapeau-sur-la-tour-montparnasse.shtml ) on top . 
  we 've put our finger on the leak , now how do we take it away ? 
  a de facto european army only france pays for . 
  in 2007 , then prime minister fran\u00e7ois fillon also said that france was in a [ `` bankrupt state '' ] ( http://www.ina.fr/politique/gouvernements/video/i09082525/francois-fillon-je-suis-a-la-tete-d-un-etat-qui-est-en-situation-de-faillite.fr.html ) . 
  it did n't stop us from waging 3 wars since then . 
  edit : of course i think that 's irresponsible . 
  we do n't have the means to spend several hundred million euros , maybe billions , in wars whose benefit to france is debatable . 
  i 've pretty much given up all hope about our politicians though , hence the sarcastic nature of that last sentence . 
  the acad\u00e9mie is in charge of registering all words and their uses , not dictating what they should be . 
  that 's the job of the commission de terminologie ;-), 
  they do come up with a lot of ridiculous words , but it 's pretty neat that we have * souris * , * ordinateur * , * internaute * , etc. , when other languages simply use the english term . 
  it 's a bit worrying that germany , that has always been a leader in europe on environmental questions , is not stalling here . 
  i guess that when you shut down your nuclear power plants and replace them by coal power plants , you have to make compromises . 
  i do n't know how the market cap is determined , but in my opinion the emission permits should have a deflation mechanism built-in . 
  for example they could lose their value by 2 % per year . 
  the trading prices are not important . 
  what is important is the total emission cap . 
  new permits may only be injected in the market by the governments if necessary and at sufficiently high prices to incentivize investment in low emission technologies . 
  the details are on europa.eu , but there is about 14 bn $ worth of vat included in eu 's `` own '' resources . 
  i 'm not sure you can count only the national contributions as that also excludes a non negligible portion of the harmonized vat . 
  you 're right that the subsidies we get diminish , but the uk rebates falls in similar proportions , it 's only 3.2 g $ now , it was the double or more 10 years ago . 
  it 's not entirely certain either that if the subsidies were removed completely that money would n't be used for something else . 
  what do you mean , take out the rebate ? 
  we contribute 990m $ to the uk rebate , so if we ditch both the agricultural subsidies and the rebate , we 're worse off by 1 billion . 
  regarding your other comment , you based your calculations on the total title 2 budget ( 55g $ ) , while i based mine only on direct aids as that is what is relevant here , and which are lower ( 40g $ ) . 
  hmmm yeah that quote might be wrong , depending on the definition of `` poorest '' . 
  the other eu members at the time were germany , france , italy , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , denmark , ireland and greece . 
  the figures com from the official eu [ website ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) . 
   they should just get some not-populist news do n't we all ? 
  yes , [ apparently ] ( http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//rtv/2005/12/16/rtv1755405/ ) * `` the rebate [ was won by ] margaret thatcher in 1984 to reflect the fact that britain , then the eu 's second poorest member , benefited little from farm subsidies '' * i just looked up a few figures ( see my post below ) : uk rebate 3.2 g $ , uk net contribution to the cap +1 g $ , french net contribution to the cap -2 g $ , french contribution to the uk rebate ( estimate assuming same repartition as in 2004 ) 1 g $ . 
  so if we remove cap and rebate altogether , you lose 2 g $ , we lose 1 g $ . 
  afaik that 's just that , you 're paying less than you `` should '' to the eu budget by about 2/3 . 
  interesting , i actually did not know that . 
  edit : i looked it up : the cap is 42 % of eu budget , and france contributes 17.2 billion $ , or 7.2 billion in proportion of the cap . 
  at the same time we receive about 20 % of the cap subsidies , the total eu budget being 105 billion $ , this is 105x0 .42 x0 .2 = 8.8 billion $ . 
  so we are in fact receiving more than we contribute , unless i made a mistake . 
  edit2 : the above was 2006 figures taken from wikipedia , i looked up the more recent [ 2011 figures ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) from the site of the european commission : * total eu budget : 129.394 billion $ * total direct aid to agriculture : 39.663 billion $ * french contribution to the eu budget : 19.617 billion $ * estimated french contribution to the cap : 19.617 x 39.663 / 129.394 = 6.013 billion $ * french cap subsidies : 8.007 g $ * conclusion : we still receive about 2 billion more than we contribute as part of the cap . 
  for fun i made the same calculations for uk : * uk contribution to the eu budget : 13.825 billion $ * estimated uk contribution to the cap : 4.238 billion $ * uk cap subsidies : 3.296 billion $ * conclusion : the uk contributes a net 1 billion $ to the cap . 
  we also pay most of your rebate . 
  ( i 'd have said ` no ' , if i was asked , for the record . ), 
  something else incredible is that despite the discovery of that `` error '' , the austerity policies have not changed by a iota . 
   russia is `` founded on its own traditional values -- the protection of which is dearer to me than even oil and gas , '' that 's an interesting set of values ... 
  i 'm not sure why you 're getting downvoted , but yeah , they and others have warned for a while that governments want increasing control over the internet . 
  complete freedom of expression is not in the best interests of those in charge . 
  tell me what you see in the top right : [ euro coin up to 2006 ] ( http://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/en/bilderstrecken/euro_coins_front_side.html?notfirst=true&amp;docid=88312 ), 
  they lowered the budget from 12m $ to 8m $ , not zero . 
  all the actual surveillance is done by a private company , and i bet this budget has not been lowered a bit . 
  they 're gorging in the money they extort through the `` r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour copie priv\u00e9e '' scheme that has increased * again * this year .
