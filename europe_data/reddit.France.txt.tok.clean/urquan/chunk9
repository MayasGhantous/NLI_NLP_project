  they 'll tell us that it is to defend secularism , but in reality mayors can sport huge wooden crosses and face no issues while women lose their job for wearing a head scarf . 
  first it was banned in the `` public space '' ( i.e. 
  the streets ) , then in government offices , and now they plan to impose this in private companies as well . 
  basically the constitutional freedom of religion is guaranteed as long as you stay at home . 
  france has many disputes with regards to its overseas territories : * * mayotte * is claimed by the comoros , and is not recognized by the un * the * \u00celes \u00c9parses * ( 5 small islands in the mozambique canal ) are disputed by madagascar * the exact location of the french guiana border is disputed with suriname, 
  maybe / r/europe as a whole still defends the current politics , but plenty of individuals are critical . 
  i ca n't say we 'll ever be a majority , historically ( in france at least ) the people have always been conservative . 
  also do n't read too much into up/down numbers , reddit fudges them to foil spam bots . 
  germany 's growth rate q4 2012 : -0.5 % . 
  worth it ? 
  do n't brag . 
  gdp growth rate for q4 2012 : * france -0.3 % * belgium -0.4 % * netherlands -1.2 % * luxembourg -0.1 % * germany -0.5 % apart from the netherlands , germany has the worst growth rate of all . 
  what 's the point of that bs article exactly ? 
  it only surfaces now because the current minister of justice has stopped giving directions to bury the investigations , and the former prosecutor of paris , who was stalling the cases , has been transfered . 
  as long as the prosecution in france depends on the executive power , we wo n't be a truly democratic country . 
  let 's say you have 50 employees at 2 $ per hour minimum wage , and the minimum wage is lowered to 1 $ , you will simply end up with 50 employees at 1 $ per hour . 
  there is no obvious reason why the amount of work needed would instantly double . 
  also note that money follows a cycle , the salary is re-injected in the economy , if employees are paid less , then there are less profits made on the domestic market . 
  the case of germany is quite different , they have strong exportations , and they are using their huge economic power to outsource unemployment to the other european countries . 
  eu is a big open market , you ca n't take each country 's case independently of the others . 
  these guy 's disdain for the judicial system is astounding . 
  it seems quite a shock for them to realize it applies to them too ( and honestly it 's something new in france ) . 
  fuck this , it 's time we let our old colonies take care of their own problems like any other country in the world . 
  nothing could have happened if he was still in power because french presidents enjoy full immunity from any legal procedure during their mandate ... 
  he 's also suspected to have been involved in a shady arms deal with pakistan to fund an electoral campaign and which ended in a [ terrorist attack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karachi_affair ) which killed 11 french engineers and technicians . 
  there are only allegations in this affair , nothing certain , but still he 's not a recommendable fellow . 
  if cyprus ends up leaving the eu and making deals with russia we 'll be really sorry . 
  all this for pocket change on the european level , that 's depressingly short term view from whoever is behind this fiasco . 
  admittedly it 's quite bothering . 
  where do these tax demands to cyprus come from ? 
  the german government ? 
  the eurogroup ? 
  in any case nobody elected at the european level . 
  first dominique strauss-kahn , and now her . 
  do n't we have a knack for choosing our politicians ? 
  the investigation was already ongoing when she was appointed , so there is no excuse . 
  the amount paid was actually 405 million $ including interest . 
  the most outrageous is that tapie was awarded 45 million $ for moral damages by the arbitral tribunal . 
  for comparison someone wrongly jailed for 7 years got [ 800 000 $ ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/09/25/les-indemnites-de-loic-secher-fixees-a-797-352-euros-par-la-justice_1765154_3224.html ) as total ( moral + material ) damages . 
  do you know how much these gas deposits exploitation rights are worth ? 
  are you so sure ? 
  out of all the affected , maybe a few are just able to pay their rent and afford what is necessary to live . 
  for these people 6.7 % might well be the difference between just getting by and poverty . 
  it is unacceptable to hurt these people under the pretense that the majority will be fine . 
  cyprus ' economy is something like 0.2 % of the eurozone . 
  if there was any semblance of solidarity among eu countries , and if the eu was more than a big market then we would have paid the 10 billion $ and taken control of the misbehaving banks instead of jeopardizing the whole zone like they 're doing now . 
  and for what ? 
  a dogmatic position of the ec ( aka the german government ) and the financial lobby which seems to run the world right now . 
  here in france people have lost all confidence in the government which has basically broken all its electoral promises and seems remote controlled by the ec . 
  things are going to get ugly . 
  how long before we the people take this into our own hands ? 
  how is it considered acceptable to create maps without a legend ? 
  it 's clearly tongue-in-cheek . 
  sentences like these give it away :  the future is whatever steve jobs and bill gates say it will be . 
  van gogh , picasso , dali did some fine paintings , but if it was not for google search , few would have seen their masterpieces . 
   also american can navigate the road while changing songs on their ipod , text massaging , and talking on blue tooth . 
  the ginormous taxes are still there , and rising , for the common citizen ... 
  in your op :  you do n't choose your sex partner by skin color but more so by gender thankfully you 're probably just a troll . 
  well played . 
  he never said or even suggested that gender and skin color could be equated at all times . 
  he made a parallel between segregation based on skin color and segregation based on sex . 
  oh if only in their times rosa parks or nelson mandela would have just stopped whining and sucked it up , what a wonderful world we 'd live in . 
  i hope you only did n't take enough time to think about what you just wrote . 
  the disposition you 're referring to is not direct democracy at all . 
  only the snake oil salesmen that serve as our leaders presented it that way . 
  in fact as you said the initiative is entirely up to the parliament , the citizen consultation only comes after , and without the organic application law this is pure travesty . 
  where the hell did you read `` united we stand '' ? 
  the greek phrase is '' \u0395\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 '' which stands for `` united in diversity '' , the [ official eu motto ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/motto/index_en.htm ) . 
  i really wish we could learn a thing or two from you guys . 
  over here whenever there is a referendum ( every 15 years or so ) the following two things happen : 1 . 
  people tend to not actually read the question and interpret it as `` do you like the current government or not ? '', 
  if the government does not like the answer the parliament goes on congress and overrides the decision . 
  oh , yes , definitely . 
  p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie , p\u00e2t\u00e9 de campagne , p\u00e2t\u00e9 de lapin ... we have other p\u00e2t\u00e9-like foods like rillettes which is shredded pork , goose or duck meat cooked with fat . 
  split a baguette in two , spread some p\u00e2t\u00e9 or rillettes inside and add a few pickles . 
  i agree that perfectly fine meat should not be wasted . 
  however i do n't agree that suddenly only the poor should eat the supposedly perfectly fine meat . 
  if this is good food , then why do n't they consume it themselves ? 
  it 's not good enough for them , but it 's good enough for the poor . 
  that 's marie-antoinette levels of condescension . 
  i can only speak about france , the delay is 2 month of failure to pay rent . 
  after that , the landlord can ask for payment through a legal officer ( * huissier de justice * ) . 
  this gives 2 more month to pay . 
  after that , most rent contracts specify that the rent ends and the tenant must leave . 
  either the tenant agrees , or he refuses and then the eviction must be done with an * huissier de justice * , a locksmith and a police officer present . 
  you can not be evicted during `` winter '' , from 1st november to 15th march . 
  what do you make of studies that show that immigration has a net benefit to economy however ? 
  immigrants are in majority young dynamic people who contribute to the working class aging european countries sorely need . 
  it seems an improvement from the prison they used to be locked in . 
  but nobody should be detained for extended periods of time unless necessary or without a court order . 
  the biggest sellers of arms to greece are the us , germany , and france . 
  the greek bailout was paid mostly by the imf ( whose biggest contributor are the us ) , germany , and france . 
  i will let you draw your own conclusions . 
  it also would mean we would have more trouble opposing policies we do n't like , such as meat riddled with hormones and antibiotics and gmos . 
  a free-trade zone would also mean considerably more competition on the market . 
  only the strongest companies would survive . 
  we already have trouble competing now because the cost of work and taxes are higher in europe . 
  this idea seems suicidal for our businesses . 
  well , `` sale '' means `` dirty '' in french , so it 's certainly weird to plaster it on your storefront . 
  as others mentioned europe is surprisingly high above the equator .
