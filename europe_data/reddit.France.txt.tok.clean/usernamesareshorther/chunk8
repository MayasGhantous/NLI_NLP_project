  and in the 80s when two superpowers threaten to nuke each other , you want to have a say , and no you do n't let greenpeace comes between your independence and you . 
  fuck no , they would have done the same thing if greenpeace was threatening their military nuclear research . 
  can you imagine that during the manhattan project ? 
  they wanted to prevent atomic tests to happen , it was either that , or an arrest at sea , that would have been very hard to do , and would have caused more casualties . 
  the ship was n't supposed to be occupied , it was and one person died . 
  france government did what it had to do to conduct its nuclear tests . 
  remember the eighties , you have reagan and the ussr threatening to bomb the shit out of each other . 
  well france needed to be able to defend itself between those two and its way was to develop itself the atomic bomb , completely independently from the us and the ussr . 
  now three decades later , trump is at the head of the us and we know we can not count on them , putin in russia and invades its neighbors , uk is leaving us . 
  france is the only european country with the atomic bomb , and has a new president with a majority that is pro-europe . 
  so now the only way to preserve and guarantee our independence as european is because france did what they had to do to achieve that goal 3 decades earlier , and they already apologized , paid repairs for the unplanned death of one person . 
  again , the boat was trying to prevent france from conducting research about the only way they had to guarantee their independence at that time and for the future . 
  the option chosen clearly limited the negative outcome , could have been more deaths , could have been information weakening their military capacity by revealing too much . 
  france is with europe , its destiny is in europe , and the nukes they have guarantee that the hyperpowers can not take advantage of us . 
  yes they are , i do n't know if they are playable though as i do n't have all the dlc !, 
   they * have * tried . 
  they have tried in the 19th century , france did that in the 16th . 
  so french has been imposed 300 years before the castillan was pushed by the central spanish government , that is my whole point :  spain has not tried ** as much ** to impose castillans while there has always been effort to unify culturally the country in france it 's not even a question of industrialized city or not , there was no industrialized city in the world in 1540 . 
  if it had happened in the same time as spain , you can be sure that lille ( formerly known as risjkel , its flemmish name ) would have kept its dutch language , but they lost it more than 300 years before !, 
   after all we 've went through to just speak catalan or basque in our territories . 
  actually , policies to impose a language came much later in spain than in france . 
  it began in the 16th century in france , in the 19th in spain . 
  i was not saying that spain did n't try to impose castillan on its people , but that it arrived much earlier in france . 
  the comment you 're answering says it 's because we did n't have industrialized cities that spoke something else than french at that time , but the truth is there was no industrialized cities in france nor in the world when french was imposed in france . 
  it was at the time of charles v in spain , could you imagine him imposing castillan in the whole spanish empire ? 
  fran\u00e7ois ist did that . 
  most likely between dunkirk and st omer , i do n't know where exactly !, 
  we have a lot in common between the north of france and the dutch : stroopwaffel , potjevleesch and [ jean bart !, 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_bart ), 
   i 'm sure you 're just as open to britain getting a percentage of all eu projects , seeing as we contributed to them . 
  of course , we will honor our commitment , and ironically most of the eu spendings in the uk will go toward regions that voted brexit . 
   take in the migrants in calais ? 
  they refuse to be in france , solutions have been proposed to them but the only thing they want is to go to the uk . 
  support for a divorce bill ? 
  you made commitment to the budget , it has created liabilities for the eu , and the eu should bear those ? 
  the `` divorce bill '' is just about paying what you say you will pay , nothing more . 
  we do n't know how much yet, 
   like police not needing a mandate to search your home or home assignments ) it 's wrong , police will need a judge for searching your house , and the home assignment can only be limited to the commune . 
  moreover your article is a bit outdated as the conseil constitutionnel changed several articles of this law . 
   so he just normalised random entering and search of private properties without the need of a mandate . 
  sweet . 
  do n't believe everything that is said on reddit , this guy made his own interpretation of the law , but the police will need an authorization from a judge , which will grant it only if it 's a terrorist matter . 
  no it 's not going to be legal , the police will need the authorization of a judge , which will grant it only if it 's a terrorist matter . 
  the new antiterrorist law authorizes some measures of the emergency state , with more power to the judiciary system . 
  i 'm going to try to give you an explanation on why we do n't have local languages here in france . 
  being french is just a cultural construction and the goal was to maintain the authority of the central power to avoid ideas of rebellion at the time or regionalism that can lead to indepency like there is in spain now . 
  spain and france are very similar in a way : only delimited by geographic borders ( pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es in the north , river in the west and the sea for the rest in spain , while in france we have the alps , the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es in the south , we wanted to go to the rhine in the east and the sea for the rest ) and not cultural borders , with a lot of different regions and different cultures inside the country . 
  the difference is that france is centralized and has imposed french everywhere , spain has not tried as much to impose castillans while there has always been effort to unify culturally the country in france . 
  the law of villers coterets was passed in 1540ish , and made french the only language that could be used by the administration or by tribunals . 
  they chose to use a dialect of langue `` d'o\u00efl '' ( the family of language that existed in the northern part of france back in middle ages , langues d'oc were the languages in the southern part ) , they specifically chose the one which was spoken in paris and the loire region , which were at the time regions personnaly owned by the king . 
  they chose that language even though it had nothing to do with local languages ( celtic in the west , germanic in the east and in the north , basque in the south-west , langues d'oc in the south , catalan in the extreme south , italian language in the southeast , there were just too many different languages ) . 
  nice for example was ` italian ' until the second part of the 19th century , and the only reason they do not speak italian is because they forbid it everywhere . 
  my grandfather was beaten at school for talking ch ` ti , the dialect in the north of france , and he told me his grandfather was beaten too for speaking flemmish ( which was the historic language of the region ) . 
  let 's now compare with a gross history of germany : it 's basically a confederation of germanic people lead by the prussians that managed to impose their hegemony on other germanic regions ( germany came once they had beaten both the austria and the french to take the alsace-lorraine ) . 
  they are culturally united : their languages were so closed that the bible written by luther in 1522 was written in a way that it was understandable by most of the german dialects . 
  if you had a bible in french at that time , people from tours , orl\u00e9ans and paris would have been able to read it , but for most of france it would have been a foreign language . 
  now , most of us feel french , and we have ended to idolize that language ( we even translate reddit words such as circlejerk , shitpost , submit , post , crosspost , i do n't know if y' all do that too ) to sum up : france built the french nation , while the german built germany . 
  looks like you missed the fleet and the army back in the 1700s . 
  clovis did kill syagrius , but i thought there were already franks living in gaul for maybe 2 centuries , they were used in the roman army . 
  but most of my knowledge on the roman empire comes from rome total war i and ii so i might be wrong ( btw the frisian always gave me a hard time !, 
  are n't there already tariffs because we did n't want to go to the iraq war ? 
   if the ** spending ** is much later than 2020 , then how can it be in the ** 2020 budget ** ? 
  because the payment do not occur the same year as the commitment . 
  it 's all written in the file i gave you :  from the perspective of the brexit bill , more important is the extent to which payments are deferred . 
  as figure 1 shows , in any given year less than half of the payments made in that year 's eu budget is actually related to commitments listed in the eu budget for that year . 
  that is to say , more than half the payments in any given year are for commitments from earlier years . 
  to look at it the other way round , more than half of the commitments made in any given year are deferred for payment from budgets in later years -- typically , it takes five years to pay down the commitments made in a year . 
  this is what creates the reste \u00e0 liquider liabilities ( see below ) . 
  it means that the last payment for the 2014-2020 budget would have been made in 2025 !, 
  i understand it , and i understand your maths are wrong , because it 's not maths but ** accounting ** . 
  please , read the file , you 'll see that they explain very well that what you pay each year is partly the contribution to the current budget , but also deferred liabilities from previous years , meaning that the spendings for the 2015-2020 budget will occur much later than in 2020 !, 
  if you read the file i gave you , they say it 's between 25b and 62b and it 's about all the liabilities generated by the 2020 budget , liabilities that wo n't end in 2020 . 
  if you have difficulties understanding the terms that are used , i can help you , do not hesitate to ask !, 
   named after a germanic tribe that invaded gaul it was not really an invasion , they were invited at first , it 's a process over several decades . 
  i do n't think the franks did fight the romans for instance . 
  you and i are not expert on the subject i believe , but [ they are . 
  ] ( http://bruegel.org/2017/03/the-uks-brexit-bill-what-are-the-possible-liabilities/ ), 
  ok , we give you belgium instead , they have beers and sausages , remind you of someone ? 
  no , it 's the commitment to the eu budget until 2020 . 
  we make a budget with the uk , the uk agrees to it , promises to pay and then would leave and let the other pays for its commitment ?!, 
  it has nothing to do with the future relationship with the eu , it has everything to do with honoring your commitment . 
   still a region within germany that is called `` franken '' ( franconia in english ) . 
  ok it 's ours now , thanks for the info . 
  the number of internship offers from london has plumeted actually and requires french as well as another eu language ( explicitly said ) , while we get a lot more offer from paris and luxembourg . 
  i think that london will still be a huge financial place , but it will lose some of its hegemony while other places are gaining attractivity . 
  we need to wait for the end of the brexit talk if we want to be sure , everything depends on the eu passport for financial securities , if you can not create securities in london and sell them in the eu , then there wo n't be much place for a newcomer like me . 
  what interests us in finance are prospects , and prospects in my field in the uk are bad . 
  i want to be a fixed-income analyst , and the eu-debt market is bigger than the uk one . 
  without the eu passport on financial securities , london has no future for me . 
   so i take it that the eu is , in fact , ready to negotiate about single market access ? 
  perhaps also about the rules on euro-clearing ? 
  it will come , but there are more pressing subjects , such as how can the eu finance the commitment made by th uk . 
  well , the frankish were a germanic people :p, 
  i believe that a good negotiator negotiate , especially when what 's at stake is the income of thousands of people . 
  franco ? 
  you are going to trigger our german friends , they consider charlemagne as german as we consider him french . 
   why would they move back anyway if they have secure jobs they do n't actually , they had secured jobs in a uk integrated to the eu market . 
  it 's totally a game changer for them , and as a market finance student , i can tell you that london is no longer a place that offers opportunities for me , and i can see that from the number of internship offers requiring me to speak french . 
  it totally changed since last summer . 
  i understand you not wanting to pay , but a commitment is a commitment and must be fulfilled , if the eu makes a commitment to some people and this commitment is based on the promise by the uk to bring funds , then the uk is commited to it too , wether it seems fair or not .
