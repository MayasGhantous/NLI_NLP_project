mayotte . 
  right , just being clear as i 'm not part of schengen . 
  i think i get it . 
  racists gather behind them but it 's different from the french far right where high figures of the party are known to be revisionists or convicted for racists crimes . 
  where i live , border are controlled by a specific police force , the same that control schengen border : `` la douane '' . 
  when flying to metropolitan france or other eu country we are checked just like any international flight , except only a simple id is enough , a passport is not required . 
  by the way , no visa needed . 
  to put it simply , it 's quite similar to before the eu . 
  that 's interesting , why do n't uk sent some policemen to check on boats ? 
  seem a way simpler solution than leaving eu ( assuming it was the only motive , which is not , i get it ) . 
  ok , that makes sense . 
  i 'm living in france but not in the schengen area so i assumed it was not mandatory . 
  land borders are easier to enforce than sea ones . 
  i speak from experience , i come from a small island in africa were immigration is massive issue ( the main one actually ) . 
  even with a full set of radars , frigates , lot of manpower . 
  the border is easy to cross . 
  anytime police control a ship at sea , risks of accidents are huge . 
  cheaper than enforcing a border on the english channel . 
  edit : actually / u/de _ noir is wrong on shengen , some part of eu are not in shengen, 
  i heard they are more proud of mozart and steve irwin . 
  i think making fun of wonderful bakery product is way more insulting and violent than joking about an ethnic cleansing / s, 
  `` baguette '' is n't offending at all for a french . 
  but i can understand why . 
  that 's why i said `` gon na nitpick '' . 
  i understand that from the litteral meaning of the word , you are correct . 
  but `` les radicaux '' is a strong and old mouvement in france . 
  see that page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radical_party_ ( france ) for more historical background . 
  even so , i guess everyone understood you . 
  if you were talking politics in a less laid back place than reddit , a french person would be confused . 
  m\u00e9lenchon is not part of radical left . 
  sylvia pinel was the candidate of the radical left and lost her coalition primaries to benoit hamon . 
  [ wikipedia page of the radical left party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radical_party_of_the_left ) edit : said simply , `` radical '' means centrist in france, 
  weird , i 'll copy it here then : first , about the background there are two things to know : * after ww2 , official french govt position was that the vichy france was not legitimate and so the french state was not responsible for french jews/political opponents persecutions . 
  in the 90s chirac acknowledged that france had some responsibility in it . 
  even if the official position is unchanged , this speech means a lot by itself . 
  * marine le pen party 's , the front national has an history of antisemitism . 
  when her father was in charge the party , he defended and was linked to revisionists , was convicted on several occasion for hate speech and racists crimes . 
  when marine le pen took over the party in 2011 , she `` cleaned '' the party . 
  she evicted some high political figures . 
  she cut the party off the `` strong far right '' . 
  the issue is , while what mlp said would n't have been very controversial in someone else 's mouth . 
  it is in her 's , some claim that the party cleaning was just about washing the doorstep . 
  a lot of high figures known to be linked with antisemitic mouvements are still in place . 
  so this statement look like an appeal to the historic fn elector base . 
  just like many far right politician use implicit meaning to look like racist to racists while claiming they never said anything racist to anti-racists . 
  just gon na nitpick . 
  `` radical left '' in france means centrist . 
  you know , history and political party naming can be confusing . 
  if only it was that simple , [ see a comment i made earlier ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64fdbq/marine_le_pen_denies_french_role_in_wartime/dg2iu3p/ ), 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande got elected on what a would call a far left campaign outside of france . 
  actually a lot of his impopularity comes from being way too rightish compared to his original engagements . 
  so what you call far left is actually way more mainstream . 
  since quite some time i have n't seen anyone call m\u00e9lenchon an extremist appart from his direct political opponents . 
  mitterrand also got elected supporting some far left ideas and included communists in his government . 
  french left have a long history of working hand in hand with communists in the parliament . 
  so , for most french , m\u00e9lenchon is just the left side of the classic left . 
  but i understand perfectly how you can see him as an extremist , i often refer to him as `` far left '' when talking with foreigners . 
  what if you find them funny ? 
  that 's how french republic works . 
  on the first round you vote for the candidate you support . 
  on the second for the one you hate the less . 
  the result is the most moderate candidate often wins . 
  mlp have a really strong and very stable electoral base . 
  she ca n't really go down enough in so little time to lose on the first round . 
  the other side is she ca n't growth enough ( according to pollers ) to win the second turn . 
  oh , ok , it in fact sound really different . 
  are they linked to racists mouvements ? 
  it 's often said that macron will suffer from a reverse hidden vote . 
  people tell to the pollers they will vote macron , but will likely change their mind when voting . 
  i 'm a bit late to the party but i 'll try to explain it clearly to non-french . 
  it 's quite a complex situation . 
  first , about the background there are two things to know : * after ww2 , official french govt position was that the vichy france was not legitimate and so the french state was not responsible for french jews/political opponents persecutions . 
  in the 90s chirac acknowledged that france had some responsibility in it . 
  even if the official position is unchanged , this speech means a lot by itself . 
  * marine le pen party 's , the front national has an history of antisemitism .

  when marine le pen took over the party in 2011 , she `` cleaned '' the party . 
  she evicted some high political figures . 
  she cut the party off the `` strong far right '' . 
  the issue is , while what mlp said would n't have been very controversial in someone else 's mouth . 
  it is in her 's , some claim that the party cleaning was just about washing the doorstep . 
  a lot of high figures known to be linked with antisemitic mouvements are still in place . 
  so this statement look like an appeal to the historic fn elector base . 
  just like many far right politician use implicit meaning to look like racist to racists while claiming they never said anything racist to anti-racists . 
  right , i see it this way : us ' liberal = socially liberal europe 's liberal = economically liberal, 
  where does it come from ? 
  how is it different ? 
  in europe `` liberal '' does not have the same meaning as in the us . 
  hence the confusion . 
  edit : for example , in france , `` ultra lib\u00e9ral '' is a pejorative political term , used against pro-maket/laissez-faire politicians . 
  us are not in europe . 
  ok , i did n't know that . 
  it 's a joke from / r/eu4 . 
  same is said about france , refered as `` baguette '' . 
  it 's mainly because they are the two strongest and most annoying nations when playing as someone else . 
  do n't see alt right conspiracies everywhere . 
  i get it for eggs but is n't chicken meat bleached in the us ? 
  here `` democracy '' is meant as democratic republic . 
  i do n't know any without separation of powers . 
  to give insight for non-french politics addicts here : it has been said a lot that the fn scored so low in the last presidential election because the `` eu exit '' is considered a big electoral no-no for a large number of french people .
