  uk has become a dead weight and even a break to the construction of the eu lately , worse than under thatcher 's reign . 
  unfortunately , the uk wo n't leave even if the popular vote ends up as a ` leave ' , as it is technically impossible for it to impose a renegociated eu contract to all 27 other countries ... there has to be unanimous vote and any eu member can veto it . 
  1 / not surprised the news comes from uk . . 2 / not sure the news will be as widespread in the opposite way , when france re-becomes ( quantitatively ) the first wine exporter next year ... 
  take into account the capacity of a country 's culinary art to renew and invent itself through centuries , the complexity of refined tastes it reaches , the diversity of food traditions said country has ( overseas regions also count in the case of france ) and the capacity to form new culinary elite ( chefs , critiques , tasters , makers ... ) if you still think that france as a whole does n't have the best of these , i suggest you read a bit about its culinary traditions and compare it to any country that you think would rival ... then come back here to admit that you failed in finding all of these at once anywhere else  you can like or dislike french food . 
  but you can not deny it has one of the oldest , the most complex , studied , and renewable culinary art on this planet . 
  haha the british , buying his wine by the company . 
  my dear fellow , learn that a good wine is never ever made by a company , but by an artisan . 
  true , import wines , even from other eu countries are still twice as expensive as they should in the uk ... 
  charles martel was christian . 
  france is secular with largest ` group ' being non-religious/atheists ... so no spanish `` reconquista '' for us here , thanks . 
  did you know that a third of the muslim immigrants abandon islam after a generation in france ? 
  ( basically thanks to education ... ) and numbers of atheists is increasing steadily . 
  always ready to help , anytime . 
  i must say you pushed that art way further than your masters , bravi . 
  honhonhon ... in over 3000 years of history , it 's always been most pleasant and distracting to have you folks as neighbours  thanks, 
  i would n't be so sure if i were you https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_wine, 
  we 'll be there as usual , with our pencils , it schools and particle colliders , 
  there never was a war . 
  france was always the best at gastronomy , since the fall of the roman empire . 
  good game . 
  and quantity is n't synonymous with quality . 
  besides , it has been one of those poor years for french wine makers , hence smaller than usual quantities . 
  will be back next year with more awesomeness , expect us . 
  in other words , yes :d although no sensible politician will ever admit publicly . 
  in a couple years , we might again be fighting christian brainwashing too ... who knows . 
  hey , where is french bashing ? 
  :d any brit still standing here ? 
  yup ... alsace , with some german heritage , is quite a shame to france on this matter ... 
  without this exception , france would n't have ( religious ) blasphemy laws at all . 
  anything is possible , if citizens bring a petition to their gov , then to strasbourg ... yes , i guess so . 
  i hope so ( although i do n't have too many illusions , poland 's population is still pretty superstitious and conservative ) . 
  this gives such a bad message from poland . 
  i wonder how many british news papers will stand for the eu ... 
  i suppose the more `` centre-libdem '' and `` left '' ones ? 
  has a right winged paper ever supported further eu integration for uk , any brits on that ? 
  wait ... so that 's underlying that russia is not part of the european continent ? 
  well , i hope you soon find out , 
  `` the uk is a net contributor to the eu budget '' so are about 10 other eu members ... they do n't whine like the uk does.besides , the uk is more a dead-weight , politically , to the eu than , say , estonia or poland ... what 's our interest in wanting to keep the uk in anyway , other than obviously cultural and historical ? 
  in nov. 2013 : overall , britain 's contribution to the eu pot amounted to $ 17bn in 2013 , behind germany , france , and italy . 
  due to corrections and `` rebates on the rebate '' enjoyed by germany , austria , the netherlands and sweden , these countries pay less than their normal share . 
  denmark recently joined this club , and will receive a rebate of around $ 130m from next year . 
  this means france and italy have been left to pick up the biggest share of the tab . 
  last year , france contributed $ 1.2 bn to britain 's rebate , while italy contributed $ 900m . 
  most of the money britain receives from the eu is used to subsidise farming ( $ 3.1 bn ) . 
  now stop whining , cash in our billions and use them better . 
  answer to question is yes . 
  as it would with any other eu country . 
  it may be that , for the specific words you have searched , there are no `` news '' or `` social '' rows to show . 
  you can also decide to show only one category of results , on the left hand side . 
  at the same time , imagine if we 'd openly said `` refugees not welcomed , asked to stay in middle east '' 1 / we go against all humane values that europe is based on ( see declaration of the rights of citizens , european convention on human rights , un convention on human rights ... ) 2 / we are criticized by middle eastern countries for not reacting 3 / it creates a bigger crisis at eu 's door , probably needing more military intervention from eu countries 4 / more money spent by not welcoming refugees than by building welcome centers within and out of the eu . 
  ( plus future citizens bringing consumption and potential growth to welcoming country ) 5 / most individual eu countries ' constitutions grant full rights of asylum to anyone in need ( for example article # 4 of the french republic 's constitution preamble , or art . 
  16 of germany 's constitution etc ), 
  yup  that 's typically some of our concerns . 
  mainly gafa and yahoo-bing : 1 / owning personal data ( and deciding by internal policy what to do with it ) 2 / making web search personal ( mainly for economical reasons , but helping data collection by public authorities in the same process ) by acting so , these companies are specifically going against the european convention of human rights , notably ( but not limited to ) article 8 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_convention_on_human_rights#article_8_-_privacy ) ( http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/gafa-eu-doesnt-love-large-american-internet-companies/ ), 
  strange , i call it documented fact . 
  let 's leave britain some time . 
  i 'm taking the bet that the uk will : 1 / stay in the eu 2 / join the eurozone within 30 years from now and i 'm not the only one to think the uk will eventually manage to raise to $ zone criteria  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10935617/after-2020-all-eu-members-will-have-to-adopt-the-euro.html http://uk.businessinsider.com/credit-suisse-thinks-that-britain-will-join-the-euro-within-20-years-if-it-votes-to-stay-in-the-eu-2015-6 http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?id=384096025126007026008071122095093085018055046063064089024013017109063088002054004048062054101028065102068104048055016005005110110114090066125117019102123009012112117031116010022003007121110107103&amp;ext=pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_and_the_euro, 
  what you may want to try is change the `` country '' and `` language '' in 2 clicks , upper right hand side , to see different results in these rows . 
  it 's a different way of browsing the visible web . 
  you 'd probably prefer `` geo-political '' , that has a more `` racial and cultural '' echo that you might enjoy :d, 
  not everybody has the same needs . 
  and some people will value esthetics over digital privacy/security ( for now no private system is able to offer both perfectly and depending on everyone 's tastes , it would still be imperfect anyway ) . 
  did you point this out to qwant ? 
  use ixquick instead of duckduckgo if you 're gon na use a meta-search engine ( still using google and yahoo-bing ) . 
  duckduckgo keeps more tracking of users ' data than ixquick ( https://duckduckgo.com/privacy#s4 ) ( https://ixquick.com/eng/protect-privacy-qa.html?hmb=1#q5 ), 
  really , now ... xd, 
  and not recognising the waves of immigration ( legal and illegal ) that forged eastern ( and western ) europe is political dishonesty , the kind of dangerous populism that led to mussolini ... not much memory ... 
  do you think we would have the eu we have now if france , germany , italy , benelux reacted as you say 60 years ago ? ... 
  really ... no , the problem is the lack of political and historical consciousness of some eastern countries . 
  as if they did n't remember anything over 10 years ago ... sad . 
  did you read my comment ? ... 
  besides if you want a more discreete system , use amnesia from a usb stick ... or better , do n't connect to anything  any microsoft/apple/linux system will have specificities that virtually anyone can spy on . 
  both are right . 
  main servers are in france , read somewhere else that they had servers on all continents . 
  otherwise it would be technically impossible to get high speed results everywhere ...  btw , servers ' hardware is provided by huawei , with a ` no backdoor ' stance ... 
  also visit the f.a.q https://www.qwant.com/faq, 
  before anyone comments here , i 'd like to stress that this is not a meta-search engine , it 's an independent search engine , with its own algorithms and servers all around the world ... so no need to compare it to ixquick or duckduckgo , because it 's not the same technology . 
  thanks . 
  coming from italy , it 's even funnier . 
  exceptional wheat harvest in france this year . 
  they 're giving the surplus of grains to the cattle instead of corn ... prices expected to stay steady . 
  lol welcome, 
  great thx, 
  well , they 're assuming that , if all these countries are in the eu , they share at least a basis of common view and needs on this point too ... disappointingly ( and surprisingly , given a certain common history ) , not even . 
  which leads some people in the west to think that some countries have entered the eu too early . 
  i think we better stop here , neighbour , 
  take it from the swedish ? 
  you have no understanding whatsoever of the founding fathers ' ideal for the eu . 
  please learn political history . 
  do you really think 2-3 million cars a year is a difficult thing to place in the world , specially with iran re-opening , china still booming , the indian market full of promises for european manufacturers ... do n't be ridiculous , no market the size of britain 's is irreplaceable . 
  on the other hand , a market of 500 million people , the biggest open trade area in the world , 15 000 billion $ in gdp , about 50 % of uk 's exports ( source http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/itis/international-trade-in-services/2011/sty-international-trade-in-services.html ) that would be a loss for london . 
  funny thing with most non economically educated brits is that they always think their economy is more important than it really is ... 65m people is , well , 65m people ... approx 0.5 % of chinese or indian population , 3 % of malaysian population , about 40 % of japanese population . 
  as with some other eu countries , the uk depends much more on eu prices and leases than the eu depends on the uk for stability . 
  besides , a higher and more volatile sterling pound currency ( as expected if britain leaves the union ) would keep a number of `` worldwide companies '' , as you say , away from investing massively in the uk . 
  let 's keep all this in mind and bring things back to proportions . 
  the economists in london know britain 's future is in the eu ( some of them also anticipate it will join the $ within 10-15 years http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10935617/after-2020-all-eu-members-will-have-to-adopt-the-euro.html ) let 's give the brits a little more time to learn about the single market and get in the bath . 
  screwed , not sure . 
  unable to deliver the uk at same tariff and cut in uk employment , most definitely . 
  once more the people would suffer , not industries in mainland eu nor big groups . 
  uk or not , the budget per population will stay in the same increasing trend ... we 'll just have 66m citizens less .
