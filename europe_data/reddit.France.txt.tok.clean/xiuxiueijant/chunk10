  or , you mean that i have to forget that americans , italians , british , canadian , french ... voluntarily fought defending the legitimate side of the conflict despite the position of their governments . 
  they can try to hide it all they want . 
  the country is full of monuments dedicated to the memory of the international brigades , like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u3lsece.jpg ) next to my parents house . 
   here next to the ebro ,  italian antifascist volunteers and from all over the world fought  shoulder to shoulder with the spanish people  for the justice , freedom and democracy  during the last big battle of the republican army some italian could help me to improve the translation , please . 
  i only saw my grandpa crying once , it was 2003 and we were watching the copa davis when the republican hymn played . 
  he looked at me and said : `` i thought i would die without listening the hymn of my country playing on tv '' . 
  the grandsons of the losers will never forget . 
  is the south of sicily asia now ? 
  i 'm going to call the geography books publishers right now , the bastards have been misleading the children of world for generations !, 
  every time a language dies , a way of seeing , describing and living our world dies with it . 
  a way of interpreting reality , construct thoughts , ... etc. 
  a language is not only a code . 
  it 's also a point of view . 
  do you know when you watch a football match and there are cameras filming from different angles ? 
  a dead language is one of these cameras turned off , we lost an angle of observing our reality because of that . 
  does this sound like an overstatement ? 
  maybe , but it 's not . 
  spanish has 2 verbs for the english verb ` to be ' , depending if the characteristic of the object is permanent or temporal . 
  in turkish , when one describes an action the sentence is conjugated different depending if the person talking has been a direct witness , someone explained it to him/her or if s/he has inferred it . 
  have you read german philosophy translated ? 
  from time to time , one stumbles upon a word untranslated that has a definition that it 's several pages long . 
  that thought could not be expressed in such a condensed way in any other language of the planet , 1 word versus 3 pages . 
  [ interesting link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpgpzp1pfqq ), 
  be careful , the nuts he 's rounded by might accuse you of terrorism . 
  and you are too young to spend life in prison . 
  let your father do it . 
  taking into account the pace of the justice , he 'll be too old to be condemned . 
  from your link ( emphasis mine )  only 29 percent of the population support bullfighting ( just ** 13 percent support it `` strongly '' ** )   seventy-five percent of respondents said they had n't attended a bullfight in the last five years and  seventy-six percent ** oppose ** use of public funds to support the bullfighting industry that pretty much supports what i said to you . 
  but , then we can read that :  the spanish parliament debates a proposed new law to declare bullfighting a cultural heritage , that 's because spanish politicians are bunch of despotic twats that want to force their ideas down everybodies throats . 
  they know better than anyone else . 
  and if someone disagrees with them , the others are worng . 
  the pp ( the party promoting the law ) has very weird ideas . 
  one of them is that no-unifromity makes the unity of the state weaker . 
  so , when catalonia banned bullfighting they saw it as an attack to `` spain 's unity ^ tm '' . 
  that 's the reason why they want to unban bullfighting , the ban is an '' `` attack '' '' to their desired uniformity ( which does n't exist ) . 
  what they do n't realize is that their lack of respect for diversity is what eventually will break the country . 
  it 's for the money the tourists pay in the plaza , around the plaza , etc. 
  the breeding , the arenas , etc. 
  are paid by the people who go there . 
  and i 've yet to find some local who has ever gone to see a bullfight . 
  tourist ans old people , these are the target audiences . 
  tourism is the first spanish `` industry '' . 
  and they are selling to tourist what they expect to find . 
  it 's like in eurodisney , you expect to find a guy dressed like pluto and take a picture with him/her . 
  tourists expect that there will be corridas and flamenco . 
  so you can find both , even in places where it 's not traditional . 
  the whole country is a theme park build around the idea of what people visiting expect to see , 0 authenticity . 
  it 's all a display for the visitors , it 's for the money . 
   bullfighting you have to know that it 's a tradition mantained only for touristic reasons . 
  most of the people in the plazas are foreigners . 
  the tourists should stop wasting their money to watch such `` espectacles '' , and bullfighting will disappear . 
  there are moments that he also sounds a little bit portuguese . 
  the way he pronounces the 's ' fooled me for a while , until there were a few russian ` r ' . 
  that was my intention . 
  the parts quoted , between '' , are idioms directly translated from : * spanish , meaning fusspot . 
  * french , meaning difficult to understand . 
  * portugais , go for a walk . 
  i thought it would be funny to write like an euro-bureaucrat . 
   also you could argue that the versailles contract led to ww2 . 
  there 's not need to argue facts . 
  every history teacher i 've had , has said always the same : the versailles treaty was one of the causes for wwii . 
  one can not humiliate a country , and expect that the inhabitants will be cool with it . 
  we could learn a lesson from that . 
   is it a matter of available jobs or more like mentality ? 
  it 's of course caused by the different mentality . 
  the millions of people losing their houses , looking for food in the garbage , committing suicide , etc. 
  all of this is because the southerners are a bunch of lazy fuckers who choose to get into a lot of shit instead of working . 
  how even you processed that in your mind ? 
  `` there might be works available down there , but people prefer to be poor , hungry , homeless ... it 's a cultural difference !! '', 
  i think that the author/s of the text are `` holding it with smoking paper '' . 
  i 've not found any problem understanding the allegedly problematic words , the politicians do n't speak `` like spanish cows '' . 
  i 'll `` go make a turn '' , now . 
  you 're thinking of cliff young ? 
  he cut in 2 ( two ) days the record of the melbourne-sidney ultra marathon by running without stopping to sleep . 
  at the beginning people made fun of how he run , but now coaches and trainers recommend cliff 's form . 
  it 's more efficient than the standard way of running . 
  [ here a video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ugfa2n0os1q ), 
  do you condemn the murder and beheading of an innocent man in the middle of the street ? 
  i 'm the one speechless . 
  you position is impossible to defend , and you keep going on . 
  there is not such a thing as not saying something . 
  you 're communicating 24/7 during all your life . 
  even when you keep your mouth shut , you 're communicating and saying things . 
  his lack of verbal condemn , is an implicit approval of the act . 
  that was a bad phrasing of mine . 
  when i said :  it should reach west the aran valley i meant more to the west , so the franja is included . 
  free speech is a right , but it 's not an absolute right . 
  * nowhere * in the world you can say absolutely what you want , nowhere . 
  there are limits , always . 
  most of the times , these limits are placed where the exercise of the right of free speech could cause a break on the social contract . 
  murder is not only a break on the social contract , it 's taking a shit on it . 
  i do n't know about the others , but catalan area is more than wrong . 
  it should be wider in the north part , it should reach west the aran valley ( and the aran valley should be in another colour , for occitan ) . 
  and a lot narrower in the south , nobody speaks catalan in castilla la mancha , even in the most western part of valencia , nobody speaks catalan ( the valencian dialect ) there . 
  what you dissent with ? 
  dissension it 's ok , everybody disagrees and has different opinions on social programs , government intervention in the economy , onions or no onions in the potato omelette ... 
  but dissenting is one thing , and the other is what we have seen in the video . 
  he has failed to say that killing that man was wrong , abhorrent and unjustifiable . 
  there 's no room for dissenting there , brutally murdering a man who has done you no harm is not ok . you know , if we tolerate this , tomorrow the beheaded could be you or me . 
  wow , that makes it even worst .
