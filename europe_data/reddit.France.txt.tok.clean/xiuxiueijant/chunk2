  * castilian is what you know as spanish , even though it 's only one of the several languages spoken there . 
  yes . 
  in spain there are millions who have catalan , basque and galician as their mother tongue . 
  so , they have castilian ^ * as their second language . 
  in addition to that , the immigrants . 
  * castilian is what you know as spanish , even though it 's only one of the several languages spoken there . 
   most chinese people 's english is on the level of your high school spanish . 
  if that 's true , i am impressed . 
  the spanish level of high school students in france is impressively good . 
  who is going to pay for this war ? 
  all parts of the hypothetical military conflict are penniless . 
  in addition to that , the catalans have no army . 
  what kind of war would be that ? 
  it will be like a bar fight at most . 
  oh , by the way , the central government is not that stupid . 
  they know very well that as soon as the first tank hits the streets , they have lost . 
  maybe they will win momentarily , but they will not convince the people that they have to remain subjugated to spain by using the army against them . 
  people will not forget , and neither forgive , in 20 , 30 or 40 years the catalans will reclaim independence again . 
  your war , would be only a delay for the unavoidable . 
  the catalans will be free again . 
  what a nice display of republican values !, 
  you should put an eagle in the middle of your flair . 
  also , sing the `` cara al sol '' . 
  that would be more aligned with the values that emanate from your comment . 
  make yourself a favour , read rousseau 's `` social contract '' ( at least the 3 first chapters ) . 
  and understand why you are so far off that you are not even wrong . 
  that will make you a better republican . 
  the police dressed as left wing radicals are very violent in spain . 
  let me fix that for you . 
  also , it \u00b4 s usually your skin head right wing `` cachorrillos '' who are the most violent . 
  low intensity terrorism 24/7 . 
  the key here is the word slight . 
  what if we cut every ones little toes just in case when people kick the coffee table it does n't hurt that much ? 
  my feet bumps into the damn thing at least once a month , and it hurts for like a minute or so . 
  i should , definitely , amputate my little toes !, 
  first , fuck you for using the `` hitler card '' . 
  second , cutting people 's body parts because some weird middle eastern iron age believe is asinine . 
  it 's asinine in nordic countries and everywhere else . 
  leave kids willies alone !, 
  bilingual is an understatement . 
  i have been in groups where the conversation was had in 3-4 languages without issues . 
  catalan , spanish , english and french around the same table easily anywhere any night . 
  that \u00b4 s amazing !, 
  thank you . 
  this days any one can be a journalist , even illiterate people !, 
  800m means 800 millis , which is 80 cents of euro , or 0.8 euros . 
  i can invest more than that in poland ... 
  if we are talking about millions m should be used . 
  did you slip from your mom \u00b4 s arms when you were little and hit too hard the ground with you head ? 
  that \u00b4 s the only possible explanation . 
  apm and cocidito madrileno on the radio were so much better . 
  also much easier to do , true . 
  but i still remember aznar speaking '' `` in catalan '' '' and saying `` visca catalunya independent '' :d oh , the radio ... 
   \u00d3 \u00f0\u00e6r , is \u00feis \u00f6ll b\u00edk\u00f6s w\u00ed \u00f0on \u00b4 t us \u00fe an\u00f0 \u00f0 ani m\u00f3r ? 
  i could get use to it . 
  it looks very fancy . 
  not only that . 
  op accuses the republic of `` sympathizing with the soviet union '' . 
  and forgets that the first country the republic asked for help was the uk ( the `` perfida albion '' , the `` archenemy '' ) and the second france . 
  only when both france and the uk had denied help , the republic accepted the soviet help . 
  which caused a war within the democratic part of the conflict !, 
  by the way , do you know which flag waves next to the french one when the anniversary of the liberation of paris ? 
  the spanish republic flag !!, 
  fuck the rojigualda . 
  the history of the spaniards who first entered paris during wwii has to be one of the most badass and epic stories of humanity . 
  cross the pyrenees without nothing , put in concentration camps , given the opportunity to fight with the french army and ending liberating paris . 
  wow . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhqlc_xnzcm 2:20, 
  i edited the link because it did n't parse well ( it contains parenthesis , that i escaped now ) . 
  is still broken ? 
  i do n't know what else to do !, 
  from goya i would have chosen [ `` saturno devorando a su hijo '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/francisco_de_goya,_saturno_devorando_a_su_hijo_\\ ( 1819-1823 \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  put it in historical context , what people of his time use to paint , how disturbing the image is ... 
  it 's the work of a genius ahead of his time , he was a punk ( and i say it in the best interpretation of the word possible ) . 
  edited because the url contains ( and ) and they needed \\ in front of them, 
  in addition to the license point , we must add that postgresql is used to teach databases in a lot of schools . 
  so , the government can hire locally people totally capable and competent within the country without the need of paying thousands to foreign people or paying thousands to people that has paid money to foreign people to learn to use the tool . 
  then , legalize drugs and put them out of business . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  i 've not felt ever spanish , my father does n't consider himself spanish , my grandfather did not consider himself spanish ... and goes on . 
  the first catalan republic , under french pprotection , dates from the xvii century !!, 
  claiming that the independence movement is something new is a lie . 
  catalufos is the most gentle thing they are going to call you . 
  the second is `` polish dog '' . 
  could spain be more cynical ? 
  the independence of catalonia will be unilateral just because the central government wants it . 
  they have refused to negotiate a pacted solution . 
  there 's a sign outside , a seal on the door and , sometimes , a diploma visible from outside hanging on the wall . 
  you should try to visit a boulangerie whose owner has been awarded the title of `` meilleur ouvrier de france '' . 
  you will recognise him/her by the collar with the french flag . 
  croissants made with the best butter you can find , the finest flours , ... for 1,5 $ i ate one of the best croissants a human can produce . 
  what were you doing reading storfrom forums , op ? 
  i was drunk and/or stoned when i made this account . 
  be glad that the i is the only mistake . 
  the debt of the catalan government is ridiculously low on % . 
  catalonia would be one of the less indebted economies of europe if independent . 
  the problem is that the central government pays back so little to the catalan government that the amount is insufficient to pay the basic services ( basis services mandatories by spanish law , by the way ) . 
  the catalan government gets into a little of debt ( to provide these services mandatory by law ) and asks for money to madrid , they say that they should not worry next year they will pay , ... and it goes on and on . 
  the catalan/valencian/madrileno ... debt is actually debt of the central government towards the local administrations . 
   and do n't they need stuff like an army ?
