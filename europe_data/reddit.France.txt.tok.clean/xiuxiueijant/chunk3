  planes ? 
  boats ? 
  catalans have paid for these things ( like the rest of the tax-payers ) , have n't they ? 
  if the passive ( the debt ) has to be split , the actives should be also split , do n't you think is fair ? 
  '' `` voted '' '' . 
  after 40 years of dictatorship people would had voted anything that were put in front of them . 
  when people live in fear of the army and under the threat of keeping living like that , they can be coerced to accept anything . 
  30 years paying 16k millions on taxes extra than they should . 
  the catalans ask for a fraction of the money that the central government owes them , and suddenly the catalans leech the spaniards . 
  do you even believe what you have written ? 
  have you had an `` intereconomia '' overdose ? 
  i invite you to visit the windiest locations in the mediterranean coast . 
  seeing how a truck makes several barrel rolls in front of you in the highway because of the wind will help you understand the magnitude of its force . 
  tons of metal and the cargo moved like they are nothing . 
  be careful with the wind , someone from the windiest place in catalonia, 
  the only thing you have to do as eu citizen is move there and that 's it . 
  also , if you register in the commune you can attend french classes for the immigrants ( super cheap , by the way ) . 
  look at the french , they are so bad that they teach people their language and help the immigrants to become part of their society !, 
  one has only to listen music to recognise that , indeed , m\u00e9tisage has had positive results . 
  mixing stuff from here and from there to make stuff that it 's neither yours nor mine , but ours !, 
  clearly negative and the same of `` mongrelisation '' ( that 's not even a real word ) . 
  the valley 's valley , to be more precise . 
  basque could be also the cause of the reduced vowel set of spanish and the lack of distinction between b/v . 
  oh , and names of places like the aran valley ... aran ( or it was arana ? ), 
  means valley in basque . 
  what the basques were doing there ? 
  we might never know ... 
  i \u00b4 ve lived for one year with 2 lithuanians , you should \u00b4 t be allowed to make fun of latvians . 
  i \u00b4 d not seen as many potatoes in a kitchen in my life . 
  there was a discount offer , 30 kg of potatoes to the house . 
  and they found it normal !, 
  i don \u00b4 t know because i \u00b4 m not there , sorry . 
  the most i can tell you is that twitter is full of angry people , but that is something you already knew . 
  the catholic right wing nutjobs crack me up . 
  if people are not having children is because they are unsure about being able to provide for them . 
  not because they use abortion as birth control , you lunatics !!, 
  improve the quality of living of the people , then the people will have children that they want instead of children they are forced to have . 
  finally , it hurted to see the aves parked in lyon ' s station . 
  millions of euros stopped there doing nothing , it was a waste . 
  the amount of jobs that eurovegas would have created was very overestimated . 
  besides , it would have attracted the kind of people you do n't want to have around : mafia people , drug dealers , money launderers , etc. 
  which means more crime , more guns , more dead people . 
  no one wants that near home . 
  it would have increased the bribes for politicians and the amount of corruption up to un-imaginable levels , to the regular people ... they never benefit from this things . 
  actually , i \u00b4 m really happy for the madrilennos . 
  the grammar and structure is the same , the vocabulary is ... different . 
  you have to think that before spaniards arrived there were people there speaking other languages . 
  that substrate gives them a lot of vocabulary unknown in the peninsula . 
  in addition to that , after/during ww2 a lot of people from italy and germany emigrated there which modified the pronunciation ( argentinians sound like italian , at least the rhythm of their sentences do ) and added even more new words . 
  it won \u00b4 t be easier than someone from hamburg trying to understand someone from zurich ... 
   i should state that i learned mexican spanish which uses proper pronunciation rather than spaniard spanish that had the , `` s '' sound being a , `` th '' . 
  great . 
  another one who is incapable of spelling well as censura , piscina , cerveza , ... because s/he does n't pronounce them properly . 
  the th sound is there for a reason , for fuck 's sake . 
  do n't use duolingo . 
  i tested the spanish course , just for fun because i have a c2 level on spanish after all . 
  with a c2 the doulingo course should be like stealing candy at the doors of a kindergarten . 
  nothing farther from the truth . 
  the course is full of south american regionalism and jargon , which makes my knowledge of standard spanish useless . 
  taking into account that you are german , i infer that you want to learn spanish for when you go on vacation . 
  the doulingo course will be worthless , no one in spain will understand you . 
  and worse , you wo n't understand anyone either . 
  if you are serious , there are plenty of `` instituto cervantes '' ( kind of the goethe institut ) centers where you can study spanish all over the european big cities . 
  besides that , there are other problems like the expectation that people learn grammar by divine infusion , instead of putting the elbows on a table to study them . 
  but that 's another story . 
   `` there has been a spectacular increase of extremist activity on the internet , websites that are xenophobic , ** anti-semitic ** , anti-islamic or ** anti-catalan ** , '' mr. ibarra said . 
  [ take a look at this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jpnobbc.jpg ) . 
  at the beginning of the second paragraph we can read : `` catalan , judio y renegado '' or `` catalan , jew and renegade '' . 
  hohoho , the day that israel recognizes the independent catalonia to re-pay the spaniards for not recognizing them until 1986 and tolerating this bullshit from the spanish '' `` patriots '' '' ... that will be glorious !, 
  the siesta is only for the summer , and only for children , old people or workers who do manual work outside . 
  why the workers outside do a siesta ? 
  because working under the sun at 40 \u00b0 kills people . 
  every year there is some `` brave hard working '' individual who dies . 
  so , there are certain hours during the day in which is impossible to work . 
  what to do during these hours ? 
  sleep , or `` sleep '' in good company . 
  sometimes , the siesta is an eufemism . 
  they do n't hate you . 
  they hate only the ones who vomit and pee on their doorsteps . 
  they should give a trip-tick when the plane land , `` do nots while in spain '' : * do not vomit on house doors . 
  * do not pee on houses doors * do not kick the rear mirrors of the parked cars . 
  * fighting to death in the middle of the street is frowned upon by the locals . 
  * chairs are used to sit , not to throw them to other people loooong etc. 
  there children learn english in the streets instead of in the schools . 
  on the other hand , your magnificent rebuttal which could only be produced by one of the geniuses that will be considered a giant on which future generations will stand on has left me speechless . 
  i 'm enlightened right now . 
  thanks mr. 
  fish . 
   spain is seen solely as castilla because that what it is . 
  spain is nothing but an expanded castilla . 
  and the castilian attitude towards the other languages and cultures of the peninsula just proves this vision right . 
  there 's only one way of being a '' `` buen espanol '' '' and that 's to be castilian , speak castilian , ... you can not be a good spaniard and speak catalan ( or any other language different than castilian ) , the country is made for that to be impossible . 
  and it 's that condescending and arrogant attitude of the castilians , and their disdain for the peripheral cultures what it 's going to kill their `` iberian mini-empire '' . 
  all the states had never been independent until they are . 
  also , i like how people like you like to ignore the ~ 300 years of catalan independence before the marriage of berenguer with petronilla . 
  and also ignore the fact that the catalans ruled aragon , take a look at : how the laws were redacted , where the kings lived and were buried , their names for fuck 's sake , which were the most rich regions of the crown , etc. 
  the crown of aragon the only thing that had aragonese was the name . 
  besides , pretending that the king of aragon married his daughter with a no one is stupid . 
  a marriage made for convenience to avoid falling under the control of the castilians , by the way . 
   nobody expect the viking in the mediterranean sea .
