  very hot '' warning in hungary , you must be careful with the stuff . 
  in other countries , people is n't as honest and label stuff as spicy that it is n't . 
   spain only gets el pais covered ... do you think that `` el mundo '' , `` abc '' , `` la razon '' or `` la gaceta '' deserve to be taken seriously ? 
  they are propaganda pamphlets , nothing else . 
  that 's what you learnt ? 
  you understood nothing , then . 
  you americans are always on top of your horses criticising the free speech laws of other countries under the assumption that you have unlimited free speech . 
  but that 's not the case , words and nudity banned are freedom of speech restrictions . 
  by the way , keep letting your nazi wannabes wander around . 
  after they raise to power ( probably disguised as republicans ) and apply their ideology on you , come back and tell us about how a good idea was tolerating their bullshit . 
  hahaha . 
  on a free open channel on prime time . 
  when your tv stops censoring words and nudity , you will be able to give lessons to france . 
  a substitute for toilet paper , indeed . 
  but not as bad one could think , if you find the right set of rocks . 
  river rocks are the best , round and soft . 
  what are you doing on reddit ? 
  yep , but that was the worst because it changed completely the meaning of what you were trying to say . 
  the others are grammar details that do n't challenge the undertandability . 
  the implicit redundancy of the number , gender and tense agreement makes them irrelevant . 
  ccpt, 
  in spanish , the open o and the open e do n't exist . 
  that 's even worse than the infamous `` my tailor is rich '' . 
  ahhhh ... 
  the spanish roundabout ... ( sight ) one can drive from roses to m\u00farcia and there 's a roundabout every 800m , give it or take it 100m . 
  is there a `` cu\u00f1ao '' ( bro in law ) with a company specialised in roundabouts ? 
  the richest bastard south the parallel 40 \u00b0 , probably . 
  ocapit\u00e3o falc\u00e3o has a new fan . 
   flip-flops cause those things are vile what ?!? 
  why do you hate comfort ? 
  if you drink a xibeca alone , yes . 
  only hobos do that . 
  but sharing a xibeca with friends it 's perfectly acceptable . 
  he can claim that because for hundreds of years the objective of the central government , kings , spanish nationalists , fascists , pp , etc. . . has been to try to make catalan disappear . 
  one has to be severely naive to believe that pp 's objective is a different one this time . 
  that 's an exaggeration . 
  but to assume that the other third is from the uk , france or spain ( equally distributed ) could be closer to the truth . 
  the 3 countries are ex-colonial super-powers , when you can travel or make business worldwide without learning a second language there 's little incentive to learn a second one . 
  disclaimer : in all three countries there are people who speak a foreign language pretty well , but these people are n't the norm . 
  yes . 
  no , it 's not . 
  how are you going to have children if you ca n't take care of them ? 
  the schools are finished at 17-18 . 
  the parents do n't arrive home until 19-20 , who takes care of the children ? 
  i 'm not really french , i live here . 
  but apparently i 'm adapting pretty well to the host culture :d, 
  * in the bars they have wine ** in bags ** of doubtful quality sold at luxury prices . 
  a glass of ` don simon ' 1000 kr\u00f3na , are you kidding me ? 
  * in the kindergartens , they have foreign people hired to speak to the children in a foreign language . 
  that 's a very good idea . 
  it 's not as bad as people says . 
  [ why not ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0h4_4ft7fo ) it 's not very good , it 's the next level , a master piece . 
  do you know it from first hand ? 
  ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ worry . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ work ^ ^ for ^ ^ hacienda, 
  that was clever and it 's a shame that only a few will understand the joke . 
  [ botswana to ban hunting over wildlife species decline ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20544251 ), 
  even if locally , in certain areas , elephant population is stable and secure , it 's still an endangered species in most of their habitats . 
  probably one of his ancestors married a niece , or half-sister , or aunt ... who happened to hold that title . 
  you know how nasty these people are . 
  you do n't miss the cheap sliced ham ? 
  in spain , less than 2 euros get you ten slices . 
  in france , 4 slices cost almost 4 euros !, 
  preparing a [ bikini ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cqivhbo.jpg ) for diner should not be a luxury !, 
  we should do something about that , you know , saving the world of the possibility of this guy claiming clay in the future . 
  [ anyone interested in a monetary donation ?

  i know that history . 
  did she call you to say that she was just leaving home when in reality she had n't showered yet ? 
  and call again to say that she 'll be there in 5 minutes while she is 10 metro stops away ? 
  yep , it was worth it ... 
  or french , or german , or british , ... 
  the issue here is that our brains have the tendency of , somehow , `` amplify '' the languages that the person understands better . 
  it 's like the brain it 's looking always for familiar sound patterns , and separates them from the others . 
  do the test and ask a foreigner who are the loudest people . 
  you 'll have a surprise . 
  first thing , do n't insult me because i have n't disrespected you and ... fuck it . 
  i downvoted you , feel free to reciprocate . 
  have a nice day . 
  it 's a threat . 
  `` do n't do that or we will punish you , be good boys '' . 
  actually ... you 're right , it 's not a threat because it will not scare anyone . 
  i agree . 
  the unionists are always saying that we 'll not be able to use euros . 
  i can also play the game of talking none-sense . 
  swiss francs or sterling pounds ? 
  does n't matter . 
  i 'll still vote for independence in the referendum . 
  '' `` their threats '' '' do n't scare me . 
  we could become a fiscal paradise and start using american dollars ... a fiscal paradise between spain and france hohoho !, 
   for example , in spain , being an hour late for a personal meeting at a cafe was acceptable , for an average estonian that is absurd . 
  an hour late acceptable ? 
  :o 20 min with a good excuse ( terrible traffic , public transportation problem , etc. ), 
  would be acceptable . 
  if you arrive an hour late to a meeting , no one will be waiting for you . 
   spaniards are loud .
