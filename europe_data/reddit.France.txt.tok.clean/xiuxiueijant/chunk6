  that 's what i thought , then i met people from other places . 
  if there was a `` loudness scale '' , i would classify spaniards in the lower half . 
  have you lived with chinese people ? 
  spaniards do n't stand a chance of being considered loud when compared with chinese people . 
  what if the rules and law are unfair ? 
  well , legally means a different thing than legitimately . 
  the spanish constitution blocks the legal aspect of the catalan independence , that does n't mean that it 's illegitimate . 
  sorry , you are right . 
  \\ #thankyoulatvia was a world trending topic yesterday . 
  minister margallo phoned to the latvian embassy to ` call them to discipline ' , whatever that means . 
  let me add a few more from los planetas : * [ la copa de europa ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo49pccwb-u ) * [ toxicosmos ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22un8b4vflk ) * [ corrientes circulares en el tiempo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egx0xy3zgty ), 
   not to mention sostres articles please ... 
  unless you read catalan , you only know from second hand about sostres ' articles . 
  if you could read them in catalan , i ca n't understand how you did not catch that the ones which offend you are satire . 
  sostres ' articles in the avui , where supposed to be a parody of a posh catalan bourgeois who think that living south the diagonal is living in the 3rd world , outside barcelona there is the jungle , that anyone who do n't vote ciu is a retarded , and of course only poor people speaks spanish etc. 
  it was an interpretation of a character so exaggerated that it was obvious that it should not be taken seriously , an `` esperpento '' . 
  how the fuck you take him seriously ? 
  he 's even interpreting his paper on tv ( very badly , i must say ) and you still take him seriously . 
  incredible . 
  please , read again and notice that i made a clear distinction between spanish and '' `` spainolators '' '' . 
  it seems that you do n't belong to the second group , that 's why i do n't see how it could good for you to remain associated with them . 
  it could be that you and me had a lot in common , but we are n't the problem . 
  the problem are the others , the '' `` ejto ej esjpa\u00f1a , jhabla esjjjpaj\u00f1ol . 
  spainolators '' '' . 
  you are telling me that if i want to associate with the good ones , i have to also associate with the awful ones . 
  get rid of the bad ones , `` cool spain '' and `` new awful but holier than thou spain '' . 
  then , maybe we could talk of remaining in `` cool spain '' , with the cool people . 
  if it only depends on the people living in catalonia , very likely . 
  it even looks like the central government is working very hard to make us desire it even more . 
  and the '' `` spainolators '' '' are also making us see it as better option day by day . 
  clue : violence , threads , insults , ... will not convince people of how wrong they are , in fact they cause more rejection . 
  as unamuno said : `` you might win , but you will not convince '' . 
  the fascists who hit yesterday an american diplomat while boycotting an act in madrid 's catalan government offices ... wow , `` well done '' guys !, 
  the spanish government pisses off the uk , you piss off an american representative and the week has not ended . 
  that 's the spanish way , making friends at every step . 
  i 've never felt spanish , but i did n't know that i was another ` thing ' either the first time that someone called me contemptuously ` polaco ' ( '' `` spainolators '' '' use polish as an insult . 
  sometimes ` perro polaco ' =  polish dog ) , since then i 've known that if being spanish is to be like them , i do n't want to be spanish . 
  there are cool spaniards , and i think that they also should separate themselves from the '' `` spainolators '' '' . 
  you know , a backwards , fascist , cock king sucking , far right-wing , ultra-catholic country where people masturbate while watching the flag waving and a normal spain . 
   how would independence affect traditional catalan places like valencia and the balearic islands ? 
  not at all . 
  unless people living there wants to also became independent . 
  but even then , it will also depend on them if they want to associate/confederate with a future hypothetical catalan republic . 
   could spain break up even more ? 
  yes . 
  that 's what happens when you do n't built a country the right way and kill everyone who tries to fix it , or force them to exile . 
  the disintegration of the country is its only future , ironically the ones who forced the situation are also the ones who call themselves `` defenders of the homeland '' . 
  their blindness and incapacity of accepting diversity is what makes their dreamed homeland a chimera . 
  actually , latvians , estonians and you , lithuanians , are our inspiration . 
  i wish it 'll all work as well for us as it did for you all . 
   all regions that once belonged to it have that as the main pattern of their respective flags ; catalonia 's one is just that pattern , the others add something , hence the yellow . 
  the 4 bars on yellow flag is previous to the marriage of [ berenger with petronila ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tkyvktr.jpg ) ... 
  in which side of the picture are the 4 bars ? 
  that 's because courses with labs are more expensive . 
  and after the first semester , every fucking engineering course has laboratory/practice hours ( even mostly theoric courses like signal processing ! ) . 
  what i find more outraging is that the workload of the labs is underestimated : the hours prior studying the theory and the hours after writing the reports are n't taken into account . 
  / me preparing pop-corn . 
  if the people of la linea are serious , how is going to analyse it the central government ? 
  these are n't either evil terrorists basques or greedy bastards catalans . 
  these are good and nice andalusians who do n't want to be spanish !, 
  that 's how he died . 
  he did a lot of other stuff before dying . 
  gaud\u00ed * did not * consider himself spanish . 
  he was a catalan forced to be spanish . 
  gaud\u00ed was catalan , he was beaten up by the spanish police for speaking catalan in public . 
  associating him with spain is an insult to his memory . 
   he organisation responsible of the security of nuclear power plants is independent in catalonia no . 
  the `` consell de seguiment de seguretat nuclear i protecci\u00f3 radiol\u00f2gica de catalunya '' is totally , one hundred percent dependent on the consejo de seguredad nuclear . 
  the weather outside [ the yellow areas ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x7aa2gh.png ) sucks balls . 
  regarding the paella , was it a real paella ? 
  or was it one of these monstrosities that people without scruples serve to tourists ? 
  [ save the paella !, 
  +10 h of high speed train to take a relaxing cup of cafe con leche in madrid 's plaza mayor ... hmmm ... not worth it . 
  i 'd rather have a relaxing glass of wine in the park . 
  la m\u00e9t\u00e9o is n't good today , though . 
  but the guy who said : `` not listen the ask '' was way worst in my opinion . 
  i felt ashamed for him , and pitied the poor people who got an aneurysm trying to decipher such grammatical aberration . 
  i know teenagers who speak better english than the president of spanish olympic committee . 
  how a thing like this happens is beyond my understanding . 
  catalan nationalism ? 
  that does n't exist . 
  it 's quite enlightening to read the opinion of someone quite anti-nationalist like einstein on the issue . 
  during his visit to barcelona in 1923 , einstein said to rafael campalans : `` this is * not * real nationalism . 
  if you want to believe me , get rid of that terrible word '' . 
  what we have in catalonia is another thing . 
  90 years ago , a german understood better the catalans than most of our ` compatriots ' . 
  that 's the idea . 
  yuo , the baltics , are our example to follow . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  catalonia is also very wealthy , and i do n't see the reason why you say that we `` wo n't work well '' outside the eu . 
  if others can , we can . 
  wow , wow . 
  hang on . 
  bottle first said that the infrastructures were 90 % finished , afterwards she said 80 % . 
  taking into account the duration of her q&a session , and the time passed since then , right now we are in the negatives !, 
  you missed the opportunity of linking this : [ rajoy happily saying `` viva el vino '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nqgsebu9c4 ) . 
  you nailed the translation . 
  well done . 
  with black-jack and whores !, 
  some are pro , and some are n't .
