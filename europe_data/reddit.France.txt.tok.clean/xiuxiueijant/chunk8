  there 's no room for conflict . 
  you know who we 're , we 'll keep selling it wherever there 's demand . 
  you can do it at home no matter where you are . 
  first things first , get good bread . 
  i know it is n't easy in this day and age of rubberish bread , but you can do it . 
  i recommend the fancy bread with green and black olives inside . 
  secondly , get good tomatoes . 
  lately , the ones that i 've found better are the hybrid variety . 
  they have lots of tender `` meat '' and a very little quantity of seeds . 
  that 's important , you want to eat the meat of the tomato , not the water that surrounds the seeds . 
  `` al meollo '' , cut the bread and let it get dry ( overnight , so you can eat it for breakfast !, 
  afterwards , you have two options and both are good : toasted or not . 
  but toasted is better . 
  do you like garlic ? 
  rub one on the toast , just a bit !, 
  otherwise , it will steal protagonism to the tomato . 
  finally , cut the tomato in half . 
  if the maturation point is optimal . 
  when you squeeze it against the bread , the `` meat '' will be left on the bread and only the skin will be left in your hand . 
  dress with arbequina olive oil and salt . 
  that 's weird . 
  i lived with a lithuanian for 2 years and that dish was always her first option when she invited people for traditional food friday night ... 
  yep , he goes to canarias and no familiar offers him a room . 
  what kind of dysfunctional family has this man ? 
  if i go on vacation near a place where i have family and i sleep in a hotel , they would get mad at me !, 
  how do you call the sweet onion , spinach and raisins `` cake '' ? 
  i would put b\u00e9chamel and parmesan on top , but the ` naked ' lithuanian version of the dish is already beyond good . 
   there 's complaints when a spanish citizen wo n't talk spanish to a spanish tourist , yes , but i think it 's reasonable . 
  i do n't know your regional language , why do you insist on ignoring our common language and making a fuss about it ? 
  i have an explanation for that and it does n't include any kind of malice from the catalan speaking side . 
  consider this , you grow up in a place where everybody you have ever met , regardless the language they speak at home , speaks/understands catalan and spanish . 
  everyone has their preferred language , that causes that bilingual conversations are a very common thing ( with people speaking in one language and getting answers in the other ) . 
  someone asks me something in spanish , and i answer in catalan ( because it 's easier and more natural for me ) . 
  that 's normal . 
  the opposite also happens . 
  for me , the strange thing is finding someone who speaks spanish and does n't know a word of catalan . 
  it 's something ingrained in my brain , if he/she speaks spanish , he/she also understands catalan . 
  it sounds reasonable , does n't it ? 
  there 's a difference between union and submission . 
  one can not talk of union when said union is imposed . 
  [ blaumut - bicicletes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wjit5w8owg ) if you like them , you can also try [ `` pa amb oli i sal '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkc5piclelg ), 
  i do n't know . 
  but the representation of christ they have chosen is a reproduction of the pantocrator christ typical of the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es romanic period . 
  which was very fruitful , by the way . 
  i 'm waiting for the day i can see on tv a friendly gibraltar vs catalonia football game . 
  that would cause so many stomach ulcers ... 
  sigh . 
  the 3 last polls indicate that the independence is already won . 
  the only thing needed is international recognition . 
  and the spaniards to keep the tanks quiet . 
  nope , because felipe v was uncapable of accepting that he was king of a piece of land that was/is more like the uk than like france . 
  his jacobin/centralist ideas are the origin of all the tension . 
  alors , on a d'omettre le pronom . 
  hahaha . 
  the `` humming '' should be : tenim un nom que el sap tothom . 
  which means : `` we have a name that everybody knows '' . 
  then , you yell the name of the club three times . 
  by the way , you have written the catalan lyrics quite well . 
  it 's impressive for a foreigner . 
  actually , that 's a loan without interests that the worker makes to the company . 
  it 's money you should get distributed along the year . 
  instead of that , the company retains part of your salary each month , does with it what it wants and you get nothing for the inconvenience . 
  next time you negotiate with your company , ask for 12 pays only . 
  it 's your money , better in your pocket than in theirs . 
  in fact , the current state of `` des-union '' started because of one of his ancestors . 
  oooops !, 
  i 've fixed it . 
  we will fight to death ^ * if necessary to save a penny . 
  * that 's an exaggeration , but almost true . 
  in the spanish case , one has to make a distinction between the ones that have lived there for centuries and the ones that have just arrived . 
  the first group are politicians , musicians , football players , plumbers ... 
  the second group are a hopeless pest . 
  i would like you to be right , but it 's the pp we are talking about . 
  they are welded to the chair, 
   that 's not a flag . 
  that 's a coat of arms the flag used by the kings of aragon was that coat of arms . 
   you do n't need to out run your neighbours back in history or vexicollogy to make a national case . 
  it 's a defence mechanism . 
  according to some spaniards , catalonia has never existed . 
  the years between the independence from charlemagne to the marriage of ramon berenguer iv and peronella ( 300 years ) never existed . 
  in before some spainard saying that the `` senyera '' is the flag of arag\u00f3n . 
  [ this was the flag of arag\u00f3n before the king of aragon married his daughter with a catalan ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/cruz_d%27eneco_arista.svg ) . 
  also , remember kids that kings do n't marry their daughters with the first man they find on the street . 
  that 's nothing , you have to meet the trio : raclette , tartiflette and quiche . 
  oh , and the croque monsieur with bretonne cr\u00eapes for breakfast !, 
  be a man , you will suck your foot after strolling from canaletes to colon barefoot . 
  and i 'll will walk on my knees : via laietana - ronda de dalt - ronda litoral . 
  [ we all have seen worse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/axcuiyy.jpg ), 
  there is a pattern . 
  the places where the romans step on have better insults . 
  ** catalan ** * mamarratxo : very poorly made person * malparit : poorly delivered as a baby . 
  your mum did not do a good job putting you in this world . 
  * babau : person without malice , too innocent . 
  * dropo : person who runs away from the work * fill de puta : son of a whore . 
  and now you can already make a good combo !, 
   `` el molt malparit \u00e9s un dropo fill de la grand\u00edssima puta '' `` the bastard is a lazy son of the great whore '' would be an attempt of translation , but it does n't sound as blunt as the original . 
  check out the hashtag #cuentaspp on twitter . 
  people are doing a good analysis job . 
   spaniards were also very family-friendly , and the birth rates there are very low . 
  take a look to the wages , the housing prices , the utility prices and add the lack of proper paternity leave and public child-care .
